  9 33    (c)  The date the defendant last failed to maintain the
  9 34 device as required by 661 IAC ch. 158.
  9 35    b.  An ignition interlock device shall not be uninstalled
 10  1 under this section if the defendant has been convicted of
 10  2 a second or subsequent violation of section 321J.2, if the
 10  3 defendant's license has been revoked for a second or subsequent
 10  4 time under this chapter, or if the defendant has been convicted
 10  5 of tampering with or circumventing an ignition interlock
 10  6 device.
 10  7    c.  The department of public safety, in consultation with the
 10  8 department, may adopt rules to administer this subsection.
 10  9    2.  a.  An ignition interlock indigent user fund is created
 10 10 in the state treasury. The fund shall be administered by
 10 11 the department and shall consist of moneys collected by the
 10 12 department under this subsection. The moneys in the fund are
 10 13 appropriated to and shall be used by the department to assist
 10 14 indigent users of ignition interlock devices in paying for the
 10 15 use of the devices. Notwithstanding section 8.33, moneys in
 10 16 the fund at the end of each fiscal year shall not revert to any
 10 17 other fund but shall remain in the fund for expenditure for
 10 18 subsequent fiscal years.
 10 19    b.  Each month, the department shall assess an ignition
 10 20 interlock user fee to each user of an ignition interlock
 10 21 device. All ignition interlock user fees shall be collected by
 10 22 the department and deposited in the ignition interlock indigent
 10 23 user fund. The amount of the monthly ignition interlock user
 10 24 fee shall be set by the department so that the moneys in the
 10 25 ignition interlock indigent user fund are sufficient to assist
 10 26 all indigent users of ignition interlock devices in paying for
 10 27 the use of the devices.
 10 28    c.  A person is indigent for the purposes of this subsection
 10 29 if any of the following apply:
 10 30    (1)  The person has an income level at or below one hundred
 10 31 twenty=five percent of the United States poverty level as
 10 32 defined by the most recently revised poverty income guidelines
 10 33 published by the United States department of health and human
 10 34 services, and the department determines that the person is
 10 35 unable to pay for the cost of an ignition interlock device. In
 11  1 making the determination of a person's ability to pay for the
 11  2 cost of a device, the department shall consider not only the
 11  3 person's income, but also the person's other assets, including
 11  4 but not limited to cash, stocks, bonds, and any other property.
 11  5    (2)  The person has an income level greater than one hundred
 11  6 twenty=five percent, but at or below two hundred percent, of
 11  7 the most recently revised poverty income guidelines published
 11  8 by the United States department of health and human services,
 11  9 and the department determines that paying for the ignition
 11 10 interlock device would cause the person substantial hardship.
 11 11 In determining whether substantial hardship would result, the
 11 12 department shall consider not only the person's income, but
 11 13 also the person's other assets, including but not limited to
 11 14 cash, stocks, bonds, and any other property.
 11 15    d.  The department shall adopt rules to administer this
 11 16 subsection, including but not limited to the manner used to
 11 17 determine the monthly ignition interlock user fee and the
 11 18 accepted form and manner in which a person may demonstrate
 11 19 indigency.
 11 20    Sec. 15.  SOBRIETY MONITORING PILOT PROGRAMS.
 11 21    1.  The department of public health, in collaboration
 11 22 with the department of corrections, the department of public
 11 23 safety, and the department of transportation, may approve an
 11 24 application from a county for a countywide sobriety monitoring
 11 25 pilot program that is available twenty=four hours per day,
 11 26 seven days per week, in an effort to reduce the number of
 11 27 crimes related to operating while intoxicated. One application
 11 28 shall be approved for a county with a population of two hundred
 11 29 thousand people or more, one application shall be approved
 11 30 for a county with a population of one hundred thousand people
 11 31 or more but less than two hundred thousand people, and one
 11 32 application shall be approved for a county with a population of
 11 33 less than one hundred thousand people.
 11 34    2.  A sobriety monitoring pilot program shall do all of the
 11 35 following:
 12  1    a.  Require a person who has been charged with, pled guilty
 12  2 to, or been convicted of a violation of section 321J.2 to
 12  3 abstain from all chemical substances for a period of time.
 12  4    b.  Require the person to be subject to testing to determine
 12  5 whether a chemical substance is present in the person's body
 12  6 in the following manner:
 12  7    (1)  At least twice per day at a central location where an
 12  8 immediate sanction can be applied.
 12  9    (2)  Where testing under subparagraph (1) is impractical, by
 12 10 continuous transdermal or electronic monitoring.
 12 11    c.  Apply sanctions when test results definitively, and
 12 12 without presumption, indicate the presence of chemical
 12 13 substances.
 12 14    d.  Require a person participating in the program to pay
 12 15 program costs, including costs of installation, monitoring, and
 12 16 deactivation of any testing devices.
 12 17    e.  Require the person to install an ignition interlock
 12 18 device of a type approved by the commissioner of public safety
 12 19 on all vehicles owned or operated by the person, and require
 12 20 the person to pay the costs associated with the installation
 12 21 and use of the ignition interlock device.
 12 22    3.  A court in a county that has established a pilot program
 12 23 pursuant to this section may order a defendant, as a condition
 12 24 of pretrial release, probation, or bond, to participate in the
 12 25 program.
 12 26    4.  An approved pilot program shall begin on January 15,
 12 27 2017, or upon the effective date of department rules, whichever
 12 28 is earlier, and shall be conducted for a minimum of one year.
 12 29    5.  The department of public health shall adopt rules
 12 30 pursuant to chapter 17A to implement this section including
 12 31 but not limited to provisions relating to applications for,
 12 32 approval of, costs of, and oversight of the pilot programs and
 12 33 reporting requirements for participating counties.
 12 34    6.  The department of public health shall submit a report on
 12 35 the results of the pilot programs and make recommendations to
 13  1 the general assembly by December 15, 2018.
 13  2    7.  For the purposes of this section, "chemical substance"
 13  3 means alcohol, wine, spirits, and beer as defined in section
 13  4 123.3 and controlled substances as defined in section 124.101.
 13  5                           EXPLANATION
 13  6 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
 13  7 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
 13  8    Current law requires a person guilty of operating while
 13  9 intoxicated (OWI) to install an ignition interlock device in
 13 10 the person's vehicle if the person seeks a temporary restricted
 13 11 license, unless the person's alcohol concentration was less
 13 12 than .10 and no accident occurred. This bill strikes that
 13 13 exception, and also requires a person guilty of OWI to install
 13 14 an ignition interlock device in the person's vehicle upon the
 13 15 revocation of the person's driver's license rather than upon
 13 16 the person's application for a temporary restricted license.
 13 17    Under current law, an ignition interlock device is required
 13 18 to be installed in a person's vehicle for the period of time
 13 19 for which the person's temporary restricted license is issued,
 13 20 and up to one additional year after license reinstatement if
 13 21 the person has two or more OWI revocations. The bill requires
 13 22 the permanent installation of an ignition interlock device with
 13 23 two exceptions. If the ignition interlock device was installed
 13 24 as a result of the person's first OWI offense or revocation and
 13 25 a test was obtained, the device shall be uninstalled 180 days
 13 26 after the person's license was revoked, the person last failed
 13 27 a test by the ignition interlock device, or the defendant last
 13 28 failed to maintain the device as required, whichever is latest.
 13 29 If the ignition interlock device was installed as a result of
 13 30 the person's first OWI offense or revocation and a test was
 13 31 refused, the device shall be uninstalled 180 days after the
 13 32 person's license revocation period is over, the person last
 13 33 failed a test by the ignition interlock device, or the person
 13 34 last failed to maintain the device as required, whichever is
 13 35 latest.
 14  1 The bill provides an ignition interlock device shall not
 14  2 be uninstalled if the person has been convicted of a second
 14  3 or subsequent OWI violation, if the person's license has been
 14  4 revoked for a second or subsequent time, or if the person has
 14  5 been convicted of tampering with or circumventing an ignition
 14  6 interlock device.
 14  7    The bill requires the department of transportation (DOT)
 14  8 to assess a monthly ignition interlock user fee to each user
 14  9 of an ignition interlock device. All ignition interlock user
 14 10 fees will be collected by the DOT and deposited in an ignition
 14 11 interlock indigent user fund (IIIUF). The bill requires the
 14 12 DOT to use the moneys in the IIIUF to assist indigent users
 14 13 of ignition interlock devices in paying for the use of the
 14 14 devices. The amount of the monthly ignition interlock user fee
 14 15 shall be set by the DOT so that the moneys in the IIIUF are
 14 16 sufficient to assist all indigent users of ignition interlock
 14 17 devices in paying for the use of the devices.
 14 18    Under the bill, a person is indigent if the person has an
 14 19 income level at or below 125 percent of the U.S. poverty level
 14 20 and the person is unable to pay for the cost of an ignition
 14 21 interlock device. A person is also indigent if the person has
 14 22 an income level greater than 125 percent, but at or below 200
 14 23 percent, of the U.S. poverty level and paying for the ignition
 14 24 interlock device would cause the person substantial hardship.
 14 25    The bill provides for county sobriety monitoring pilot
 14 26 programs. The bill allows the department of public health
 14 27 (DPH), in collaboration with the department of corrections,
 14 28 the department of public safety, and the DOT, to approve
 14 29 applications from counties for countywide sobriety monitoring
 14 30 pilot programs. The programs are to be available 24 hours per
 14 31 day, seven days per week, in an effort to reduce the number
 14 32 of crimes related to OWI.  One application shall be approved
 14 33 for a county with a population of 200,000 people or more, one
 14 34 application shall be approved for a county with a population of
 14 35 100,000 people or more but less than 200,000 people, and one
 15  1 application shall be approved for a county with a population of
 15  2 less than 100,000 people.
 15  3    The programs shall require individuals charged with or
 15  4 convicted of OWI to abstain from all chemical substances for
 15  5 a period of time. The programs are to require testing to
 15  6 determine whether a chemical substance is present at least
 15  7 twice per day at a central location where an immediate sanction
 15  8 can be applied or, where such testing is impractical, by
 15  9 continuous transdermal or electronic monitoring. The programs
 15 10 shall also apply sanctions when test results definitively
 15 11 indicate the presence of a chemical substance. The programs
 15 12 shall require participants to pay program costs and to install
 15 13 an ignition interlock device.
 15 14    A court in a county that has established a pilot program
 15 15 may order a defendant, as a condition of pretrial release,
 15 16 probation, or bond, to participate in the program. Approved
 15 17 pilot programs shall begin January 15, 2017, or upon the
 15 18 effective date of DPH rules, whichever is earlier, and shall
 15 19 be conducted for a minimum of one year. The DPH is to adopt
 15 20 rules to implement the programs, including but not limited to
 15 21 provisions relating to applications for, approval of, costs of,
 15 22 and oversight of the pilot programs and reporting requirements
 15 23 for participating counties. The DPH is directed to submit
 15 24 a report on the results of the pilot programs and make
 15 25 recommendations to the general assembly by December 15, 2018.

 10  7    c.  The department of public safety, in consultation with the
 10  8 department, may adopt rules to administer this subsection.
 10  9    2.  a.  An ignition interlock indigent user fund is created
 10 10 in the state treasury. The fund shall be administered by
 10 11 the department and shall consist of moneys collected by the
 10 12 department under this subsection. The moneys in the fund are
 10 13 appropriated to and shall be used by the department to assist
 10 14 indigent users of ignition interlock devices in paying for the
 10 15 use of the devices. Notwithstanding section 8.33, moneys in
 10 16 the fund at the end of each fiscal year shall not revert to any
 10 17 other fund but shall remain in the fund for expenditure for
 10 18 subsequent fiscal years.
 10 19    b.  Each month, the department shall assess an ignition
 10 20 interlock user fee to each user of an ignition interlock
 10 21 device. All ignition interlock user fees shall be collected by

 12 34    6.  The department of public health shall submit a report on
 12 35 the results of the pilot programs and make recommendations to
 13  1 the general assembly by December 15, 2018.
 13  2    7.  For the purposes of this section, "chemical substance"
 13  3 means alcohol, wine, spirits, and beer as defined in section
 13  4 123.3 and controlled substances as defined in section 124.101.
 13  5                           EXPLANATION
 13  6 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
 13  7 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
 13  8    Current law requires a person guilty of operating while
 13  9 intoxicated (OWI) to install an ignition interlock device in
 13 10 the person's vehicle if the person seeks a temporary restricted
 13 11 license, unless the person's alcohol concentration was less
 13 12 than .10 and no accident occurred. This bill strikes that
 13 13 exception, and also requires a person guilty of OWI to install
 13 14 an ignition interlock device in the person's vehicle upon the
 13 15 revocation of the person's driver's license rather than upon
 13 16 the person's application for a temporary restricted license.
 13 17    Under current law, an ignition interlock device is required
 13 18 to be installed in a person's vehicle for the period of time
 13 19 for which the person's temporary restricted license is issued,
 13 20 and up to one additional year after license reinstatement if
 13 21 the person has two or more OWI revocations. The bill requires
 13 22 the permanent installation of an ignition interlock device with
 13 23 two exceptions. If the ignition interlock device was installed
 13 24 as a result of the person's first OWI offense or revocation and
 13 25 a test was obtained, the device shall be uninstalled 180 days
 13 26 after the person's license was revoked, the person last failed
 13 27 a test by the ignition interlock device, or the defendant last
 13 28 failed to maintain the device as required, whichever is latest.
 13 29 If the ignition interlock device was installed as a result of
 13 30 the person's first OWI offense or revocation and a test was
 13 31 refused, the device shall be uninstalled 180 days after the
 13 32 person's license revocation period is over, the person last
 13 33 failed a test by the ignition interlock device, or the person
 13 34 last failed to maintain the device as required, whichever is
 13 35 latest.
 14  1 The bill provides an ignition interlock device shall not
 14  2 be uninstalled if the person has been convicted of a second
 14  3 or subsequent OWI violation, if the person's license has been
 14  4 revoked for a second or subsequent time, or if the person has
 14  5 been convicted of tampering with or circumventing an ignition
 14  6 interlock device.
 14  7    The bill requires the department of transportation (DOT)
 14  8 to assess a monthly ignition interlock user fee to each user
 14  9 of an ignition interlock device. All ignition interlock user
 14 10 fees will be collected by the DOT and deposited in an ignition
 14 11 interlock indigent user fund (IIIUF). The bill requires the
 14 12 DOT to use the moneys in the IIIUF to assist indigent users
 14 13 of ignition interlock devices in paying for the use of the
 14 14 devices. The amount of the monthly ignition interlock user fee
 14 15 shall be set by the DOT so that the moneys in the IIIUF are
 14 16 sufficient to assist all indigent users of ignition interlock
 14 17 devices in paying for the use of the devices.
 14 18    Under the bill, a person is indigent if the person has an
 14 19 income level at or below 125 percent of the U.S. poverty level
 14 20 and the person is unable to pay for the cost of an ignition
 14 21 interlock device. A person is also indigent if the person has
 14 22 an income level greater than 125 percent, but at or below 200
 14 23 percent, of the U.S. poverty level and paying for the ignition
 14 24 interlock device would cause the person substantial hardship.
 14 25    The bill provides for county sobriety monitoring pilot
 14 26 programs. The bill allows the department of public health
 14 27 (DPH), in collaboration with the department of corrections,
 14 28 the department of public safety, and the DOT, to approve
 14 29 applications from counties for countywide sobriety monitoring
 14 30 pilot programs. The programs are to be available 24 hours per
 14 31 day, seven days per week, in an effort to reduce the number
 14 32 of crimes related to OWI.  One application shall be approved
 14 33 for a county with a population of 200,000 people or more, one
 14 34 application shall be approved for a county with a population of
 14 35 100,000 people or more but less than 200,000 people, and one
 15  1 application shall be approved for a county with a population of
 15  2 less than 100,000 people.
 15  3    The programs shall require individuals charged with or
 15  4 convicted of OWI to abstain from all chemical substances for
 15  5 a period of time. The programs are to require testing to
 15  6 determine whether a chemical substance is present at least
 15  7 twice per day at a central location where an immediate sanction
 15  8 can be applied or, where such testing is impractical, by
 15  9 continuous transdermal or electronic monitoring. The programs
 15 10 shall also apply sanctions when test results definitively
 15 11 indicate the presence of a chemical substance. The programs
 15 12 shall require participants to pay program costs and to install
 15 13 an ignition interlock device.
 15 14    A court in a county that has established a pilot program
 15 15 may order a defendant, as a condition of pretrial release,
 15 16 probation, or bond, to participate in the program. Approved
 15 17 pilot programs shall begin January 15, 2017, or upon the
 15 18 effective date of DPH rules, whichever is earlier, and shall
 15 19 be conducted for a minimum of one year. The DPH is to adopt
 15 20 rules to implement the programs, including but not limited to
 15 21 provisions relating to applications for, approval of, costs of,
 15 22 and oversight of the pilot programs and reporting requirements
 15 23 for participating counties. The DPH is directed to submit
 15 24 a report on the results of the pilot programs and make
 15 25 recommendations to the general assembly by December 15, 2018.

 10  5 of tampering with or circumventing an ignition interlock
 10  6 device.
 10  7    c.  The department of public safety, in consultation with the
 10  8 department, may adopt rules to administer this subsection.
 10  9    2.  a.  An ignition interlock indigent user fund is created
 10 10 in the state treasury. The fund shall be administered by
 10 11 the department and shall consist of moneys collected by the
 10 12 department under this subsection. The moneys in the fund are
 10 13 appropriated to and shall be used by the department to assist
 10 14 indigent users of ignition interlock devices in paying for the
 10 15 use of the devices. Notwithstanding section 8.33, moneys in
 10 16 the fund at the end of each fiscal year shall not revert to any
 10 17 other fund but shall remain in the fund for expenditure for
 10 18 subsequent fiscal years.
 10 19    b.  Each month, the department shall assess an ignition
 10 20 interlock user fee to each user of an ignition interlock
 10 21 device. All ignition interlock user fees shall be collected by
 10 22 the department and deposited in the ignition interlock indigent
 10 23 user fund. The amount of the monthly ignition interlock user
 10 24 fee shall be set by the department so that the moneys in the
 10 25 ignition interlock indigent user fund are sufficient to assist
 10 26 all indigent users of ignition interlock devices in paying for
 10 27 the use of the devices.
 10 28    c.  A person is indigent for the purposes of this subsection
 10 29 if any of the following apply:
 10 30    (1)  The person has an income level at or below one hundred
 10 31 twenty=five percent of the United States poverty level as
 10 32 defined by the most recently revised poverty income guidelines
 10 33 published by the United States department of health and human
 10 34 services, and the department determines that the person is
 10 35 unable to pay for the cost of an ignition interlock device. In
 11  1 making the determination of a person's ability to pay for the
 11  2 cost of a device, the department shall consider not only the
 11  3 person's income, but also the person's other assets, including
 11  4 but not limited to cash, stocks, bonds, and any other property.
 11  5    (2)  The person has an income level greater than one hundred
 11  6 twenty=five percent, but at or below two hundred percent, of
 11  7 the most recently revised poverty income guidelines published
 11  8 by the United States department of health and human services,
 11  9 and the department determines that paying for the ignition
 11 10 interlock device would cause the person substantial hardship.
 11 11 In determining whether substantial hardship would result, the
 11 12 department shall consider not only the person's income, but
 11 13 also the person's other assets, including but not limited to
 11 14 cash, stocks, bonds, and any other property.
 11 15    d.  The department shall adopt rules to administer this
 11 16 subsection, including but not limited to the manner used to
 11 17 determine the monthly ignition interlock user fee and the
 11 18 accepted form and manner in which a person may demonstrate
 11 19 indigency.
 11 20    Sec. 15.  SOBRIETY MONITORING PILOT PROGRAMS.
 11 21    1.  The department of public health, in collaboration
 11 22 with the department of corrections, the department of public
 11 23 safety, and the department of transportation, may approve an
 11 24 application from a county for a countywide sobriety monitoring
 11 25 pilot program that is available twenty=four hours per day,
 11 26 seven days per week, in an effort to reduce the number of
 11 27 crimes related to operating while intoxicated. One application
 11 28 shall be approved for a county with a population of two hundred
 11 29 thousand people or more, one application shall be approved
 11 30 for a county with a population of one hundred thousand people
 11 31 or more but less than two hundred thousand people, and one
 11 32 application shall be approved for a county with a population of
 11 33 less than one hundred thousand people.
 11 34    2.  A sobriety monitoring pilot program shall do all of the
 11 35 following:
 12  1    a.  Require a person who has been charged with, pled guilty
 12  2 to, or been convicted of a violation of section 321J.2 to
 12  3 abstain from all chemical substances for a period of time.
 12  4    b.  Require the person to be subject to testing to determine
 12  5 whether a chemical substance is present in the person's body
 12  6 in the following manner:
 12  7    (1)  At least twice per day at a central location where an
 12  8 immediate sanction can be applied.
 12  9    (2)  Where testing under subparagraph (1) is impractical, by
 12 10 continuous transdermal or electronic monitoring.
 12 11    c.  Apply sanctions when test results definitively, and
 12 12 without presumption, indicate the presence of chemical
 12 13 substances.
 12 14    d.  Require a person participating in the program to pay
 12 15 program costs, including costs of installation, monitoring, and
 12 16 deactivation of any testing devices.
 12 17    e.  Require the person to install an ignition interlock
 12 18 device of a type approved by the commissioner of public safety
 12 19 on all vehicles owned or operated by the person, and require
 12 20 the person to pay the costs associated with the installation
 12 21 and use of the ignition interlock device.
 12 22    3.  A court in a county that has established a pilot program
 12 23 pursuant to this section may order a defendant, as a condition
 12 24 of pretrial release, probation, or bond, to participate in the
 12 25 program.
 12 26    4.  An approved pilot program shall begin on January 15,
 12 27 2017, or upon the effective date of department rules, whichever
 12 28 is earlier, and shall be conducted for a minimum of one year.
 12 29    5.  The department of public health shall adopt rules
 12 30 pursuant to chapter 17A to implement this section including
 12 31 but not limited to provisions relating to applications for,
 12 32 approval of, costs of, and oversight of the pilot programs and
 12 33 reporting requirements for participating counties.
 12 34    6.  The department of public health shall submit a report on
 12 35 the results of the pilot programs and make recommendations to
 13  1 the general assembly by December 15, 2018.
 13  2    7.  For the purposes of this section, "chemical substance"
 13  3 means alcohol, wine, spirits, and beer as defined in section
 13  4 123.3 and controlled substances as defined in section 124.101.
 13  5                           EXPLANATION
 13  6 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
 13  7 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
 13  8    Current law requires a person guilty of operating while
 13  9 intoxicated (OWI) to install an ignition interlock device in
 13 10 the person's vehicle if the person seeks a temporary restricted
 13 11 license, unless the person's alcohol concentration was less
 13 12 than .10 and no accident occurred. This bill strikes that
 13 13 exception, and also requires a person guilty of OWI to install
 13 14 an ignition interlock device in the person's vehicle upon the
 13 15 revocation of the person's driver's license rather than upon
 13 16 the person's application for a temporary restricted license.
 13 17    Under current law, an ignition interlock device is required
 13 18 to be installed in a person's vehicle for the period of time
 13 19 for which the person's temporary restricted license is issued,
 13 20 and up to one additional year after license reinstatement if
 13 21 the person has two or more OWI revocations. The bill requires
 13 22 the permanent installation of an ignition interlock device with
 13 23 two exceptions. If the ignition interlock device was installed
 13 24 as a result of the person's first OWI offense or revocation and
 13 25 a test was obtained, the device shall be uninstalled 180 days
 13 26 after the person's license was revoked, the person last failed
 13 27 a test by the ignition interlock device, or the defendant last
 13 28 failed to maintain the device as required, whichever is latest.
 13 29 If the ignition interlock device was installed as a result of
 13 30 the person's first OWI offense or revocation and a test was
 13 31 refused, the device shall be uninstalled 180 days after the
 13 32 person's license revocation period is over, the person last
 13 33 failed a test by the ignition interlock device, or the person
 13 34 last failed to maintain the device as required, whichever is
 13 35 latest.
 14  1 The bill provides an ignition interlock device shall not
 14  2 be uninstalled if the person has been convicted of a second
 14  3 or subsequent OWI violation, if the person's license has been
 14  4 revoked for a second or subsequent time, or if the person has
 14  5 been convicted of tampering with or circumventing an ignition
 14  6 interlock device.
 14  7    The bill requires the department of transportation (DOT)
 14  8 to assess a monthly ignition interlock user fee to each user
 14  9 of an ignition interlock device. All ignition interlock user
 14 10 fees will be collected by the DOT and deposited in an ignition
 14 11 interlock indigent user fund (IIIUF). The bill requires the
 14 12 DOT to use the moneys in the IIIUF to assist indigent users
 14 13 of ignition interlock devices in paying for the use of the
 14 14 devices. The amount of the monthly ignition interlock user fee
 14 15 shall be set by the DOT so that the moneys in the IIIUF are
 14 16 sufficient to assist all indigent users of ignition interlock
 14 17 devices in paying for the use of the devices.
 14 18    Under the bill, a person is indigent if the person has an
 14 19 income level at or below 125 percent of the U.S. poverty level
 14 20 and the person is unable to pay for the cost of an ignition
 14 21 interlock device. A person is also indigent if the person has
 14 22 an income level greater than 125 percent, but at or below 200
 14 23 percent, of the U.S. poverty level and paying for the ignition
 14 24 interlock device would cause the person substantial hardship.
 14 25    The bill provides for county sobriety monitoring pilot
 14 26 programs. The bill allows the department of public health
 14 27 (DPH), in collaboration with the department of corrections,
 14 28 the department of public safety, and the DOT, to approve
 14 29 applications from counties for countywide sobriety monitoring
 14 30 pilot programs. The programs are to be available 24 hours per
 14 31 day, seven days per week, in an effort to reduce the number
 14 32 of crimes related to OWI.  One application shall be approved
 14 33 for a county with a population of 200,000 people or more, one
 14 34 application shall be approved for a county with a population of
 14 35 100,000 people or more but less than 200,000 people, and one
 15  1 application shall be approved for a county with a population of
 15  2 less than 100,000 people.
 15  3    The programs shall require individuals charged with or
 15  4 convicted of OWI to abstain from all chemical substances for
 15  5 a period of time. The programs are to require testing to
 15  6 determine whether a chemical substance is present at least
 15  7 twice per day at a central location where an immediate sanction
 15  8 can be applied or, where such testing is impractical, by
 15  9 continuous transdermal or electronic monitoring. The programs
 15 10 shall also apply sanctions when test results definitively
 15 11 indicate the presence of a chemical substance. The programs
 15 12 shall require participants to pay program costs and to install
 15 13 an ignition interlock device.
 15 14    A court in a county that has established a pilot program
 15 15 may order a defendant, as a condition of pretrial release,
 15 16 probation, or bond, to participate in the program. Approved
 15 17 pilot programs shall begin January 15, 2017, or upon the
 15 18 effective date of DPH rules, whichever is earlier, and shall
 15 19 be conducted for a minimum of one year. The DPH is to adopt
 15 20 rules to implement the programs, including but not limited to
 15 21 provisions relating to applications for, approval of, costs of,
 15 22 and oversight of the pilot programs and reporting requirements
 15 23 for participating counties. The DPH is directed to submit
 15 24 a report on the results of the pilot programs and make
 15 25 recommendations to the general assembly by December 15, 2018.

 10 10 in the state treasury. The fund shall be administered by
 10 11 the department and shall consist of moneys collected by the
 10 12 department under this subsection. The moneys in the fund are
 10 13 appropriated to and shall be used by the department to assist
 10 14 indigent users of ignition interlock devices in paying for the
 10 15 use of the devices. Notwithstanding section 8.33, moneys in
 10 16 the fund at the end of each fiscal year shall not revert to any
 10 17 other fund but shall remain in the fund for expenditure for
 10 18 subsequent fiscal years.
 10 19    b.  Each month, the department shall assess an ignition
 10 20 interlock user fee to each user of an ignition interlock
 10 21 device. All ignition interlock user fees shall be collected by
 10 22 the department and deposited in the ignition interlock indigent
 10 23 user fund. The amount of the monthly ignition interlock user
 10 24 fee shall be set by the department so that the moneys in the

 10 31 twenty=five percent of the United States poverty level as
 10 32 defined by the most recently revised poverty income guidelines
 10 33 published by the United States department of health and human
 10 34 services, and the department determines that the person is
 10 35 unable to pay for the cost of an ignition interlock device. In
 11  1 making the determination of a person's ability to pay for the
 11  2 cost of a device, the department shall consider not only the
 11  3 person's income, but also the person's other assets, including
 11  4 but not limited to cash, stocks, bonds, and any other property.

 11 20    Sec. 15.  SOBRIETY MONITORING PILOT PROGRAMS.
 11 21    1.  The department of public health, in collaboration
 11 22 with the department of corrections, the department of public
 11 23 safety, and the department of transportation, may approve an
 11 24 application from a county for a countywide sobriety monitoring
 11 25 pilot program that is available twenty=four hours per day,
 11 26 seven days per week, in an effort to reduce the number of
 11 27 crimes related to operating while intoxicated. One application
 11 28 shall be approved for a county with a population of two hundred
 11 29 thousand people or more, one application shall be approved
 11 30 for a county with a population of one hundred thousand people
 11 31 or more but less than two hundred thousand people, and one

 12  5 whether a chemical substance is present in the person's body
 12  6 in the following manner:
 12  7    (1)  At least twice per day at a central location where an
 12  8 immediate sanction can be applied.
 12  9    (2)  Where testing under subparagraph (1) is impractical, by
 12 10 continuous transdermal or electronic monitoring.
 12 11    c.  Apply sanctions when test results definitively, and
 12 12 without presumption, indicate the presence of chemical
 12 13 substances.
 12 14    d.  Require a person participating in the program to pay
 12 15 program costs, including costs of installation, monitoring, and
 12 16 deactivation of any testing devices.
 12 17    e.  Require the person to install an ignition interlock
 12 18 device of a type approved by the commissioner of public safety
 12 19 on all vehicles owned or operated by the person, and require
 12 20 the person to pay the costs associated with the installation
 12 21 and use of the ignition interlock device.
 12 22    3.  A court in a county that has established a pilot program
 12 23 pursuant to this section may order a defendant, as a condition
 12 24 of pretrial release, probation, or bond, to participate in the
 12 25 program.
 12 26    4.  An approved pilot program shall begin on January 15,
 12 27 2017, or upon the effective date of department rules, whichever
 12 28 is earlier, and shall be conducted for a minimum of one year.
 12 29    5.  The department of public health shall adopt rules
 12 30 pursuant to chapter 17A to implement this section including
 12 31 but not limited to provisions relating to applications for,
 12 32 approval of, costs of, and oversight of the pilot programs and
 12 33 reporting requirements for participating counties.
 12 34    6.  The department of public health shall submit a report on
 12 35 the results of the pilot programs and make recommendations to
 13  1 the general assembly by December 15, 2018.
 13  2    7.  For the purposes of this section, "chemical substance"
 13  3 means alcohol, wine, spirits, and beer as defined in section
 13  4 123.3 and controlled substances as defined in section 124.101.
 13  5                           EXPLANATION
 13  6 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
 13  7 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
 13  8    Current law requires a person guilty of operating while
 13  9 intoxicated (OWI) to install an ignition interlock device in
 13 10 the person's vehicle if the person seeks a temporary restricted
 13 11 license, unless the person's alcohol concentration was less
 13 12 than .10 and no accident occurred. This bill strikes that
 13 13 exception, and also requires a person guilty of OWI to install
 13 14 an ignition interlock device in the person's vehicle upon the
 13 15 revocation of the person's driver's license rather than upon
 13 16 the person's application for a temporary restricted license.
 13 17    Under current law, an ignition interlock device is required
 13 18 to be installed in a person's vehicle for the period of time
 13 19 for which the person's temporary restricted license is issued,
 13 20 and up to one additional year after license reinstatement if
 13 21 the person has two or more OWI revocations. The bill requires
 13 22 the permanent installation of an ignition interlock device with
 13 23 two exceptions. If the ignition interlock device was installed
 13 24 as a result of the person's first OWI offense or revocation and
 13 25 a test was obtained, the device shall be uninstalled 180 days
 13 26 after the person's license was revoked, the person last failed
 13 27 a test by the ignition interlock device, or the defendant last
 13 28 failed to maintain the device as required, whichever is latest.
 13 29 If the ignition interlock device was installed as a result of
 13 30 the person's first OWI offense or revocation and a test was
 13 31 refused, the device shall be uninstalled 180 days after the
 13 32 person's license revocation period is over, the person last
 13 33 failed a test by the ignition interlock device, or the person
 13 34 last failed to maintain the device as required, whichever is
 13 35 latest.
 14  1 The bill provides an ignition interlock device shall not
 14  2 be uninstalled if the person has been convicted of a second
 14  3 or subsequent OWI violation, if the person's license has been
 14  4 revoked for a second or subsequent time, or if the person has
 14  5 been convicted of tampering with or circumventing an ignition
 14  6 interlock device.
 14  7    The bill requires the department of transportation (DOT)
 14  8 to assess a monthly ignition interlock user fee to each user
 14  9 of an ignition interlock device. All ignition interlock user
 14 10 fees will be collected by the DOT and deposited in an ignition
 14 11 interlock indigent user fund (IIIUF). The bill requires the
 14 12 DOT to use the moneys in the IIIUF to assist indigent users
 14 13 of ignition interlock devices in paying for the use of the
 14 14 devices. The amount of the monthly ignition interlock user fee
 14 15 shall be set by the DOT so that the moneys in the IIIUF are
 14 16 sufficient to assist all indigent users of ignition interlock
 14 17 devices in paying for the use of the devices.
 14 18    Under the bill, a person is indigent if the person has an
 14 19 income level at or below 125 percent of the U.S. poverty level
 14 20 and the person is unable to pay for the cost of an ignition
 14 21 interlock device. A person is also indigent if the person has
 14 22 an income level greater than 125 percent, but at or below 200
 14 23 percent, of the U.S. poverty level and paying for the ignition
 14 24 interlock device would cause the person substantial hardship.
 14 25    The bill provides for county sobriety monitoring pilot
 14 26 programs. The bill allows the department of public health
 14 27 (DPH), in collaboration with the department of corrections,
 14 28 the department of public safety, and the DOT, to approve
 14 29 applications from counties for countywide sobriety monitoring
 14 30 pilot programs. The programs are to be available 24 hours per
 14 31 day, seven days per week, in an effort to reduce the number
 14 32 of crimes related to OWI.  One application shall be approved
 14 33 for a county with a population of 200,000 people or more, one
 14 34 application shall be approved for a county with a population of
 14 35 100,000 people or more but less than 200,000 people, and one
 15  1 application shall be approved for a county with a population of
 15  2 less than 100,000 people.
 15  3    The programs shall require individuals charged with or
 15  4 convicted of OWI to abstain from all chemical substances for
 15  5 a period of time. The programs are to require testing to
 15  6 determine whether a chemical substance is present at least
 15  7 twice per day at a central location where an immediate sanction
 15  8 can be applied or, where such testing is impractical, by
 15  9 continuous transdermal or electronic monitoring. The programs
 15 10 shall also apply sanctions when test results definitively
 15 11 indicate the presence of a chemical substance. The programs
 15 12 shall require participants to pay program costs and to install
 15 13 an ignition interlock device.
 15 14    A court in a county that has established a pilot program
 15 15 may order a defendant, as a condition of pretrial release,
 15 16 probation, or bond, to participate in the program. Approved
 15 17 pilot programs shall begin January 15, 2017, or upon the
 15 18 effective date of DPH rules, whichever is earlier, and shall
 15 19 be conducted for a minimum of one year. The DPH is to adopt
 15 20 rules to implement the programs, including but not limited to
 15 21 provisions relating to applications for, approval of, costs of,
 15 22 and oversight of the pilot programs and reporting requirements
 15 23 for participating counties. The DPH is directed to submit
 15 24 a report on the results of the pilot programs and make
 15 25 recommendations to the general assembly by December 15, 2018.

  9 27 following:
  9 28    (a)  The date the defendant's license revocation period
  9 29 ends.
  9 30    (b)  The date the defendant last failed a test or retest
  9 31 by the device because the defendant's alcohol concentration
  9 32 exceeded the limit established under 661 IAC 158.6.
  9 33    (c)  The date the defendant last failed to maintain the
  9 34 device as required by 661 IAC ch. 158.
  9 35    b.  An ignition interlock device shall not be uninstalled
 10  1 under this section if the defendant has been convicted of
 10  2 a second or subsequent violation of section 321J.2, if the
 10  3 defendant's license has been revoked for a second or subsequent
 10  4 time under this chapter, or if the defendant has been convicted
 10  5 of tampering with or circumventing an ignition interlock
 10  6 device.
 10  7    c.  The department of public safety, in consultation with the
 10  8 department, may adopt rules to administer this subsection.
 10  9    2.  a.  An ignition interlock indigent user fund is created
 10 10 in the state treasury. The fund shall be administered by
 10 11 the department and shall consist of moneys collected by the
 10 12 department under this subsection. The moneys in the fund are
 10 13 appropriated to and shall be used by the department to assist
 10 14 indigent users of ignition interlock devices in paying for the
 10 15 use of the devices. Notwithstanding section 8.33, moneys in
 10 16 the fund at the end of each fiscal year shall not revert to any
 10 17 other fund but shall remain in the fund for expenditure for
 10 18 subsequent fiscal years.
 10 19    b.  Each month, the department shall assess an ignition
 10 20 interlock user fee to each user of an ignition interlock
 10 21 device. All ignition interlock user fees shall be collected by
 10 22 the department and deposited in the ignition interlock indigent
 10 23 user fund. The amount of the monthly ignition interlock user
 10 24 fee shall be set by the department so that the moneys in the
 10 25 ignition interlock indigent user fund are sufficient to assist
 10 26 all indigent users of ignition interlock devices in paying for
 10 27 the use of the devices.
 10 28    c.  A person is indigent for the purposes of this subsection
 10 29 if any of the following apply:
 10 30    (1)  The person has an income level at or below one hundred
 10 31 twenty=five percent of the United States poverty level as
 10 32 defined by the most recently revised poverty income guidelines
 10 33 published by the United States department of health and human
 10 34 services, and the department determines that the person is
 10 35 unable to pay for the cost of an ignition interlock device. In
 11  1 making the determination of a person's ability to pay for the
 11  2 cost of a device, the department shall consider not only the
 11  3 person's income, but also the person's other assets, including
 11  4 but not limited to cash, stocks, bonds, and any other property.
 11  5    (2)  The person has an income level greater than one hundred
 11  6 twenty=five percent, but at or below two hundred percent, of
 11  7 the most recently revised poverty income guidelines published
 11  8 by the United States department of health and human services,
 11  9 and the department determines that paying for the ignition
 11 10 interlock device would cause the person substantial hardship.
 11 11 In determining whether substantial hardship would result, the
 11 12 department shall consider not only the person's income, but
 11 13 also the person's other assets, including but not limited to
 11 14 cash, stocks, bonds, and any other property.
 11 15    d.  The department shall adopt rules to administer this
 11 16 subsection, including but not limited to the manner used to
 11 17 determine the monthly ignition interlock user fee and the
 11 18 accepted form and manner in which a person may demonstrate
 11 19 indigency.
 11 20    Sec. 15.  SOBRIETY MONITORING PILOT PROGRAMS.
 11 21    1.  The department of public health, in collaboration
 11 22 with the department of corrections, the department of public
 11 23 safety, and the department of transportation, may approve an
 11 24 application from a county for a countywide sobriety monitoring
 11 25 pilot program that is available twenty=four hours per day,
 11 26 seven days per week, in an effort to reduce the number of
 11 27 crimes related to operating while intoxicated. One application
 11 28 shall be approved for a county with a population of two hundred
 11 29 thousand people or more, one application shall be approved
 11 30 for a county with a population of one hundred thousand people
 11 31 or more but less than two hundred thousand people, and one
 11 32 application shall be approved for a county with a population of
 11 33 less than one hundred thousand people.
 11 34    2.  A sobriety monitoring pilot program shall do all of the
 11 35 following:
 12  1    a.  Require a person who has been charged with, pled guilty
 12  2 to, or been convicted of a violation of section 321J.2 to
 12  3 abstain from all chemical substances for a period of time.
 12  4    b.  Require the person to be subject to testing to determine
 12  5 whether a chemical substance is present in the person's body
 12  6 in the following manner:
 12  7    (1)  At least twice per day at a central location where an
 12  8 immediate sanction can be applied.
 12  9    (2)  Where testing under subparagraph (1) is impractical, by
 12 10 continuous transdermal or electronic monitoring.
 12 11    c.  Apply sanctions when test results definitively, and
 12 12 without presumption, indicate the presence of chemical
 12 13 substances.
 12 14    d.  Require a person participating in the program to pay
 12 15 program costs, including costs of installation, monitoring, and
 12 16 deactivation of any testing devices.
 12 17    e.  Require the person to install an ignition interlock
 12 18 device of a type approved by the commissioner of public safety
 12 19 on all vehicles owned or operated by the person, and require
 12 20 the person to pay the costs associated with the installation
 12 21 and use of the ignition interlock device.
 12 22    3.  A court in a county that has established a pilot program
 12 23 pursuant to this section may order a defendant, as a condition
 12 24 of pretrial release, probation, or bond, to participate in the
 12 25 program.
 12 26    4.  An approved pilot program shall begin on January 15,
 12 27 2017, or upon the effective date of department rules, whichever
 12 28 is earlier, and shall be conducted for a minimum of one year.
 12 29    5.  The department of public health shall adopt rules

 12 32 approval of, costs of, and oversight of the pilot programs and
 12 33 reporting requirements for participating counties.
 12 34    6.  The department of public health shall submit a report on
 12 35 the results of the pilot programs and make recommendations to
 13  1 the general assembly by December 15, 2018.
 13  2    7.  For the purposes of this section, "chemical substance"
 13  3 means alcohol, wine, spirits, and beer as defined in section
 13  4 123.3 and controlled substances as defined in section 124.101.
 13  5                           EXPLANATION
 13  6 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
 13  7 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
 13  8    Current law requires a person guilty of operating while
 13  9 intoxicated (OWI) to install an ignition interlock device in
 13 10 the person's vehicle if the person seeks a temporary restricted
 13 11 license, unless the person's alcohol concentration was less
 13 12 than .10 and no accident occurred. This bill strikes that
 13 13 exception, and also requires a person guilty of OWI to install
 13 14 an ignition interlock device in the person's vehicle upon the
 13 15 revocation of the person's driver's license rather than upon
 13 16 the person's application for a temporary restricted license.
 13 17    Under current law, an ignition interlock device is required
 13 18 to be installed in a person's vehicle for the period of time
 13 19 for which the person's temporary restricted license is issued,
 13 20 and up to one additional year after license reinstatement if
 13 21 the person has two or more OWI revocations. The bill requires
 13 22 the permanent installation of an ignition interlock device with
 13 23 two exceptions. If the ignition interlock device was installed
 13 24 as a result of the person's first OWI offense or revocation and
 13 25 a test was obtained, the device shall be uninstalled 180 days
 13 26 after the person's license was revoked, the person last failed
 13 27 a test by the ignition interlock device, or the defendant last
 13 28 failed to maintain the device as required, whichever is latest.
 13 29 If the ignition interlock device was installed as a result of
 13 30 the person's first OWI offense or revocation and a test was
 13 31 refused, the device shall be uninstalled 180 days after the
 13 32 person's license revocation period is over, the person last
 13 33 failed a test by the ignition interlock device, or the person
 13 34 last failed to maintain the device as required, whichever is
 13 35 latest.
 14  1 The bill provides an ignition interlock device shall not
 14  2 be uninstalled if the person has been convicted of a second
 14  3 or subsequent OWI violation, if the person's license has been
 14  4 revoked for a second or subsequent time, or if the person has
 14  5 been convicted of tampering with or circumventing an ignition
 14  6 interlock device.
 14  7    The bill requires the department of transportation (DOT)
 14  8 to assess a monthly ignition interlock user fee to each user
 14  9 of an ignition interlock device. All ignition interlock user
 14 10 fees will be collected by the DOT and deposited in an ignition
 14 11 interlock indigent user fund (IIIUF). The bill requires the
 14 12 DOT to use the moneys in the IIIUF to assist indigent users
 14 13 of ignition interlock devices in paying for the use of the
 14 14 devices. The amount of the monthly ignition interlock user fee
 14 15 shall be set by the DOT so that the moneys in the IIIUF are
 14 16 sufficient to assist all indigent users of ignition interlock
 14 17 devices in paying for the use of the devices.
 14 18    Under the bill, a person is indigent if the person has an
 14 19 income level at or below 125 percent of the U.S. poverty level
 14 20 and the person is unable to pay for the cost of an ignition
 14 21 interlock device. A person is also indigent if the person has
 14 22 an income level greater than 125 percent, but at or below 200
 14 23 percent, of the U.S. poverty level and paying for the ignition
 14 24 interlock device would cause the person substantial hardship.
 14 25    The bill provides for county sobriety monitoring pilot
 14 26 programs. The bill allows the department of public health
 14 27 (DPH), in collaboration with the department of corrections,
 14 28 the department of public safety, and the DOT, to approve
 14 29 applications from counties for countywide sobriety monitoring
 14 30 pilot programs. The programs are to be available 24 hours per
 14 31 day, seven days per week, in an effort to reduce the number
 14 32 of crimes related to OWI.  One application shall be approved
 14 33 for a county with a population of 200,000 people or more, one
 14 34 application shall be approved for a county with a population of
 14 35 100,000 people or more but less than 200,000 people, and one
 15  1 application shall be approved for a county with a population of
 15  2 less than 100,000 people.
 15  3    The programs shall require individuals charged with or
 15  4 convicted of OWI to abstain from all chemical substances for
 15  5 a period of time. The programs are to require testing to
 15  6 determine whether a chemical substance is present at least
 15  7 twice per day at a central location where an immediate sanction
 15  8 can be applied or, where such testing is impractical, by
 15  9 continuous transdermal or electronic monitoring. The programs
 15 10 shall also apply sanctions when test results definitively
 15 11 indicate the presence of a chemical substance. The programs
 15 12 shall require participants to pay program costs and to install
 15 13 an ignition interlock device.
 15 14    A court in a county that has established a pilot program
 15 15 may order a defendant, as a condition of pretrial release,
 15 16 probation, or bond, to participate in the program. Approved
 15 17 pilot programs shall begin January 15, 2017, or upon the
 15 18 effective date of DPH rules, whichever is earlier, and shall
 15 19 be conducted for a minimum of one year. The DPH is to adopt
 15 20 rules to implement the programs, including but not limited to
 15 21 provisions relating to applications for, approval of, costs of,
 15 22 and oversight of the pilot programs and reporting requirements
 15 23 for participating counties. The DPH is directed to submit
 15 24 a report on the results of the pilot programs and make
 15 25 recommendations to the general assembly by December 15, 2018.

 10 10 in the state treasury. The fund shall be administered by
 10 11 the department and shall consist of moneys collected by the
 10 12 department under this subsection. The moneys in the fund are
 10 13 appropriated to and shall be used by the department to assist
 10 14 indigent users of ignition interlock devices in paying for the
 10 15 use of the devices. Notwithstanding section 8.33, moneys in
 10 16 the fund at the end of each fiscal year shall not revert to any
 10 17 other fund but shall remain in the fund for expenditure for
 10 18 subsequent fiscal years.
 10 19    b.  Each month, the department shall assess an ignition
 10 20 interlock user fee to each user of an ignition interlock
 10 21 device. All ignition interlock user fees shall be collected by
 10 22 the department and deposited in the ignition interlock indigent
 10 23 user fund. The amount of the monthly ignition interlock user
 10 24 fee shall be set by the department so that the moneys in the
 10 25 ignition interlock indigent user fund are sufficient to assist
 10 26 all indigent users of ignition interlock devices in paying for
 10 27 the use of the devices.
 10 28    c.  A person is indigent for the purposes of this subsection
 10 29 if any of the following apply:
 10 30    (1)  The person has an income level at or below one hundred
 10 31 twenty=five percent of the United States poverty level as
 10 32 defined by the most recently revised poverty income guidelines
 10 33 published by the United States department of health and human
 10 34 services, and the department determines that the person is
 10 35 unable to pay for the cost of an ignition interlock device. In
 11  1 making the determination of a person's ability to pay for the
 11  2 cost of a device, the department shall consider not only the
 11  3 person's income, but also the person's other assets, including
 11  4 but not limited to cash, stocks, bonds, and any other property.
 11  5    (2)  The person has an income level greater than one hundred
 11  6 twenty=five percent, but at or below two hundred percent, of
 11  7 the most recently revised poverty income guidelines published
 11  8 by the United States department of health and human services,
 11  9 and the department determines that paying for the ignition
 11 10 interlock device would cause the person substantial hardship.
 11 11 In determining whether substantial hardship would result, the
 11 12 department shall consider not only the person's income, but
 11 13 also the person's other assets, including but not limited to
 11 14 cash, stocks, bonds, and any other property.
 11 15    d.  The department shall adopt rules to administer this
 11 16 subsection, including but not limited to the manner used to
 11 17 determine the monthly ignition interlock user fee and the
 11 18 accepted form and manner in which a person may demonstrate
 11 19 indigency.
 11 20    Sec. 15.  SOBRIETY MONITORING PILOT PROGRAMS.
 11 21    1.  The department of public health, in collaboration
 11 22 with the department of corrections, the department of public
 11 23 safety, and the department of transportation, may approve an
 11 24 application from a county for a countywide sobriety monitoring
 11 25 pilot program that is available twenty=four hours per day,
 11 26 seven days per week, in an effort to reduce the number of
 11 27 crimes related to operating while intoxicated. One application
 11 28 shall be approved for a county with a population of two hundred
 11 29 thousand people or more, one application shall be approved
 11 30 for a county with a population of one hundred thousand people
 11 31 or more but less than two hundred thousand people, and one
 11 32 application shall be approved for a county with a population of
 11 33 less than one hundred thousand people.
 11 34    2.  A sobriety monitoring pilot program shall do all of the
 11 35 following:
 12  1    a.  Require a person who has been charged with, pled guilty
 12  2 to, or been convicted of a violation of section 321J.2 to
 12  3 abstain from all chemical substances for a period of time.
 12  4    b.  Require the person to be subject to testing to determine
 12  5 whether a chemical substance is present in the person's body
 12  6 in the following manner:
 12  7    (1)  At least twice per day at a central location where an
 12  8 immediate sanction can be applied.
 12  9    (2)  Where testing under subparagraph (1) is impractical, by
 12 10 continuous transdermal or electronic monitoring.
 12 11    c.  Apply sanctions when test results definitively, and
 12 12 without presumption, indicate the presence of chemical
 12 13 substances.
 12 14    d.  Require a person participating in the program to pay
 12 15 program costs, including costs of installation, monitoring, and
 12 16 deactivation of any testing devices.
 12 17    e.  Require the person to install an ignition interlock
 12 18 device of a type approved by the commissioner of public safety
 12 19 on all vehicles owned or operated by the person, and require
 12 20 the person to pay the costs associated with the installation
 12 21 and use of the ignition interlock device.
 12 22    3.  A court in a county that has established a pilot program
 12 23 pursuant to this section may order a defendant, as a condition
 12 24 of pretrial release, probation, or bond, to participate in the
 12 25 program.
 12 26    4.  An approved pilot program shall begin on January 15,
 12 27 2017, or upon the effective date of department rules, whichever
 12 28 is earlier, and shall be conducted for a minimum of one year.
 12 29    5.  The department of public health shall adopt rules
 12 30 pursuant to chapter 17A to implement this section including
 12 31 but not limited to provisions relating to applications for,
 12 32 approval of, costs of, and oversight of the pilot programs and
 12 33 reporting requirements for participating counties.
 12 34    6.  The department of public health shall submit a report on
 12 35 the results of the pilot programs and make recommendations to
 13  1 the general assembly by December 15, 2018.
 13  2    7.  For the purposes of this section, "chemical substance"
 13  3 means alcohol, wine, spirits, and beer as defined in section
 13  4 123.3 and controlled substances as defined in section 124.101.
 13  5                           EXPLANATION
 13  6 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
 13  7 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
 13  8    Current law requires a person guilty of operating while
 13  9 intoxicated (OWI) to install an ignition interlock device in
 13 10 the person's vehicle if the person seeks a temporary restricted
 13 11 license, unless the person's alcohol concentration was less
 13 12 than .10 and no accident occurred. This bill strikes that
 13 13 exception, and also requires a person guilty of OWI to install
 13 14 an ignition interlock device in the person's vehicle upon the
 13 15 revocation of the person's driver's license rather than upon
 13 16 the person's application for a temporary restricted license.
 13 17    Under current law, an ignition interlock device is required
 13 18 to be installed in a person's vehicle for the period of time
 13 19 for which the person's temporary restricted license is issued,
 13 20 and up to one additional year after license reinstatement if
 13 21 the person has two or more OWI revocations. The bill requires
 13 22 the permanent installation of an ignition interlock device with
 13 23 two exceptions. If the ignition interlock device was installed
 13 24 as a result of the person's first OWI offense or revocation and
 13 25 a test was obtained, the device shall be uninstalled 180 days
 13 26 after the person's license was revoked, the person last failed
 13 27 a test by the ignition interlock device, or the defendant last
 13 28 failed to maintain the device as required, whichever is latest.
 13 29 If the ignition interlock device was installed as a result of
 13 30 the person's first OWI offense or revocation and a test was
 13 31 refused, the device shall be uninstalled 180 days after the
 13 32 person's license revocation period is over, the person last
 13 33 failed a test by the ignition interlock device, or the person
 13 34 last failed to maintain the device as required, whichever is
 13 35 latest.
 14  1 The bill provides an ignition interlock device shall not
 14  2 be uninstalled if the person has been convicted of a second
 14  3 or subsequent OWI violation, if the person's license has been
 14  4 revoked for a second or subsequent time, or if the person has
 14  5 been convicted of tampering with or circumventing an ignition
 14  6 interlock device.
 14  7    The bill requires the department of transportation (DOT)
 14  8 to assess a monthly ignition interlock user fee to each user
 14  9 of an ignition interlock device. All ignition interlock user
 14 10 fees will be collected by the DOT and deposited in an ignition
 14 11 interlock indigent user fund (IIIUF). The bill requires the
 14 12 DOT to use the moneys in the IIIUF to assist indigent users
 14 13 of ignition interlock devices in paying for the use of the
 14 14 devices. The amount of the monthly ignition interlock user fee
 14 15 shall be set by the DOT so that the moneys in the IIIUF are
 14 16 sufficient to assist all indigent users of ignition interlock
 14 17 devices in paying for the use of the devices.
 14 18    Under the bill, a person is indigent if the person has an
 14 19 income level at or below 125 percent of the U.S. poverty level
 14 20 and the person is unable to pay for the cost of an ignition
 14 21 interlock device. A person is also indigent if the person has
 14 22 an income level greater than 125 percent, but at or below 200
 14 23 percent, of the U.S. poverty level and paying for the ignition
 14 24 interlock device would cause the person substantial hardship.
 14 25    The bill provides for county sobriety monitoring pilot
 14 26 programs. The bill allows the department of public health
 14 27 (DPH), in collaboration with the department of corrections,
 14 28 the department of public safety, and the DOT, to approve
 14 29 applications from counties for countywide sobriety monitoring
 14 30 pilot programs. The programs are to be available 24 hours per
 14 31 day, seven days per week, in an effort to reduce the number
 14 32 of crimes related to OWI.  One application shall be approved
 14 33 for a county with a population of 200,000 people or more, one
 14 34 application shall be approved for a county with a population of
 14 35 100,000 people or more but less than 200,000 people, and one
 15  1 application shall be approved for a county with a population of
 15  2 less than 100,000 people.
 15  3    The programs shall require individuals charged with or
 15  4 convicted of OWI to abstain from all chemical substances for
 15  5 a period of time. The programs are to require testing to
 15  6 determine whether a chemical substance is present at least
 15  7 twice per day at a central location where an immediate sanction
 15  8 can be applied or, where such testing is impractical, by
 15  9 continuous transdermal or electronic monitoring. The programs
 15 10 shall also apply sanctions when test results definitively
 15 11 indicate the presence of a chemical substance. The programs
 15 12 shall require participants to pay program costs and to install
 15 13 an ignition interlock device.
 15 14    A court in a county that has established a pilot program
 15 15 may order a defendant, as a condition of pretrial release,
 15 16 probation, or bond, to participate in the program. Approved
 15 17 pilot programs shall begin January 15, 2017, or upon the
 15 18 effective date of DPH rules, whichever is earlier, and shall
 15 19 be conducted for a minimum of one year. The DPH is to adopt
 15 20 rules to implement the programs, including but not limited to
 15 21 provisions relating to applications for, approval of, costs of,
 15 22 and oversight of the pilot programs and reporting requirements
 15 23 for participating counties. The DPH is directed to submit
 15 24 a report on the results of the pilot programs and make
 15 25 recommendations to the general assembly by December 15, 2018.

  9 33    (c)  The date the defendant last failed to maintain the
  9 34 device as required by 661 IAC ch. 158.
  9 35    b.  An ignition interlock device shall not be uninstalled
 10  1 under this section if the defendant has been convicted of
 10  2 a second or subsequent violation of section 321J.2, if the
 10  3 defendant's license has been revoked for a second or subsequent
 10  4 time under this chapter, or if the defendant has been convicted
 10  5 of tampering with or circumventing an ignition interlock
 10  6 device.
 10  7    c.  The department of public safety, in consultation with the
 10  8 department, may adopt rules to administer this subsection.
 10  9    2.  a.  An ignition interlock indigent user fund is created
 10 10 in the state treasury. The fund shall be administered by
 10 11 the department and shall consist of moneys collected by the
 10 12 department under this subsection. The moneys in the fund are
 10 13 appropriated to and shall be used by the department to assist
 10 14 indigent users of ignition interlock devices in paying for the
 10 15 use of the devices. Notwithstanding section 8.33, moneys in
 10 16 the fund at the end of each fiscal year shall not revert to any
 10 17 other fund but shall remain in the fund for expenditure for
 10 18 subsequent fiscal years.
 10 19    b.  Each month, the department shall assess an ignition
 10 20 interlock user fee to each user of an ignition interlock
 10 21 device. All ignition interlock user fees shall be collected by
 10 22 the department and deposited in the ignition interlock indigent
 10 23 user fund. The amount of the monthly ignition interlock user
 10 24 fee shall be set by the department so that the moneys in the
 10 25 ignition interlock indigent user fund are sufficient to assist
 10 26 all indigent users of ignition interlock devices in paying for
 10 27 the use of the devices.
 10 28    c.  A person is indigent for the purposes of this subsection
 10 29 if any of the following apply:
 10 30    (1)  The person has an income level at or below one hundred
 10 31 twenty=five percent of the United States poverty level as
 10 32 defined by the most recently revised poverty income guidelines
 10 33 published by the United States department of health and human
 10 34 services, and the department determines that the person is
 10 35 unable to pay for the cost of an ignition interlock device. In
 11  1 making the determination of a person's ability to pay for the
 11  2 cost of a device, the department shall consider not only the
 11  3 person's income, but also the person's other assets, including
 11  4 but not limited to cash, stocks, bonds, and any other property.
 11  5    (2)  The person has an income level greater than one hundred
 11  6 twenty=five percent, but at or below two hundred percent, of
 11  7 the most recently revised poverty income guidelines published
 11  8 by the United States department of health and human services,
 11  9 and the department determines that paying for the ignition
 11 10 interlock device would cause the person substantial hardship.
 11 11 In determining whether substantial hardship would result, the
 11 12 department shall consider not only the person's income, but
 11 13 also the person's other assets, including but not limited to
 11 14 cash, stocks, bonds, and any other property.
 11 15    d.  The department shall adopt rules to administer this
 11 16 subsection, including but not limited to the manner used to

 11 18 accepted form and manner in which a person may demonstrate
 11 19 indigency.
 11 20    Sec. 15.  SOBRIETY MONITORING PILOT PROGRAMS.
 11 21    1.  The department of public health, in collaboration
 11 22 with the department of corrections, the department of public
 11 23 safety, and the department of transportation, may approve an
 11 24 application from a county for a countywide sobriety monitoring
 11 25 pilot program that is available twenty=four hours per day,
 11 26 seven days per week, in an effort to reduce the number of
 11 27 crimes related to operating while intoxicated. One application
 11 28 shall be approved for a county with a population of two hundred
 11 29 thousand people or more, one application shall be approved
 11 30 for a county with a population of one hundred thousand people
 11 31 or more but less than two hundred thousand people, and one
 11 32 application shall be approved for a county with a population of
 11 33 less than one hundred thousand people.
 11 34    2.  A sobriety monitoring pilot program shall do all of the
 11 35 following:
 12  1    a.  Require a person who has been charged with, pled guilty
 12  2 to, or been convicted of a violation of section 321J.2 to
 12  3 abstain from all chemical substances for a period of time.
 12  4    b.  Require the person to be subject to testing to determine
 12  5 whether a chemical substance is present in the person's body
 12  6 in the following manner:
 12  7    (1)  At least twice per day at a central location where an
 12  8 immediate sanction can be applied.
 12  9    (2)  Where testing under subparagraph (1) is impractical, by
 12 10 continuous transdermal or electronic monitoring.
 12 11    c.  Apply sanctions when test results definitively, and
 12 12 without presumption, indicate the presence of chemical
 12 13 substances.
 12 14    d.  Require a person participating in the program to pay
 12 15 program costs, including costs of installation, monitoring, and
 12 16 deactivation of any testing devices.
 12 17    e.  Require the person to install an ignition interlock
 12 18 device of a type approved by the commissioner of public safety
 12 19 on all vehicles owned or operated by the person, and require
 12 20 the person to pay the costs associated with the installation
 12 21 and use of the ignition interlock device.
 12 22    3.  A court in a county that has established a pilot program
 12 23 pursuant to this section may order a defendant, as a condition
 12 24 of pretrial release, probation, or bond, to participate in the
 12 25 program.
 12 26    4.  An approved pilot program shall begin on January 15,
 12 27 2017, or upon the effective date of department rules, whichever
 12 28 is earlier, and shall be conducted for a minimum of one year.
 12 29    5.  The department of public health shall adopt rules
 12 30 pursuant to chapter 17A to implement this section including
 12 31 but not limited to provisions relating to applications for,

 12 33 reporting requirements for participating counties.
 12 34    6.  The department of public health shall submit a report on
 12 35 the results of the pilot programs and make recommendations to
 13  1 the general assembly by December 15, 2018.
 13  2    7.  For the purposes of this section, "chemical substance"
 13  3 means alcohol, wine, spirits, and beer as defined in section
 13  4 123.3 and controlled substances as defined in section 124.101.
 13  5                           EXPLANATION
 13  6 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
 13  7 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
 13  8    Current law requires a person guilty of operating while
 13  9 intoxicated (OWI) to install an ignition interlock device in
 13 10 the person's vehicle if the person seeks a temporary restricted
 13 11 license, unless the person's alcohol concentration was less
 13 12 than .10 and no accident occurred. This bill strikes that
 13 13 exception, and also requires a person guilty of OWI to install
 13 14 an ignition interlock device in the person's vehicle upon the
 13 15 revocation of the person's driver's license rather than upon
 13 16 the person's application for a temporary restricted license.
 13 17    Under current law, an ignition interlock device is required
 13 18 to be installed in a person's vehicle for the period of time
 13 19 for which the person's temporary restricted license is issued,
 13 20 and up to one additional year after license reinstatement if
 13 21 the person has two or more OWI revocations. The bill requires
 13 22 the permanent installation of an ignition interlock device with
 13 23 two exceptions. If the ignition interlock device was installed
 13 24 as a result of the person's first OWI offense or revocation and
 13 25 a test was obtained, the device shall be uninstalled 180 days
 13 26 after the person's license was revoked, the person last failed
 13 27 a test by the ignition interlock device, or the defendant last
 13 28 failed to maintain the device as required, whichever is latest.
 13 29 If the ignition interlock device was installed as a result of
 13 30 the person's first OWI offense or revocation and a test was
 13 31 refused, the device shall be uninstalled 180 days after the
 13 32 person's license revocation period is over, the person last
 13 33 failed a test by the ignition interlock device, or the person
 13 34 last failed to maintain the device as required, whichever is
 13 35 latest.
 14  1 The bill provides an ignition interlock device shall not
 14  2 be uninstalled if the person has been convicted of a second
 14  3 or subsequent OWI violation, if the person's license has been
 14  4 revoked for a second or subsequent time, or if the person has
 14  5 been convicted of tampering with or circumventing an ignition
 14  6 interlock device.
 14  7    The bill requires the department of transportation (DOT)
 14  8 to assess a monthly ignition interlock user fee to each user
 14  9 of an ignition interlock device. All ignition interlock user
 14 10 fees will be collected by the DOT and deposited in an ignition
 14 11 interlock indigent user fund (IIIUF). The bill requires the
 14 12 DOT to use the moneys in the IIIUF to assist indigent users
 14 13 of ignition interlock devices in paying for the use of the
 14 14 devices. The amount of the monthly ignition interlock user fee
 14 15 shall be set by the DOT so that the moneys in the IIIUF are
 14 16 sufficient to assist all indigent users of ignition interlock
 14 17 devices in paying for the use of the devices.
 14 18    Under the bill, a person is indigent if the person has an
 14 19 income level at or below 125 percent of the U.S. poverty level
 14 20 and the person is unable to pay for the cost of an ignition
 14 21 interlock device. A person is also indigent if the person has
 14 22 an income level greater than 125 percent, but at or below 200
 14 23 percent, of the U.S. poverty level and paying for the ignition
 14 24 interlock device would cause the person substantial hardship.
 14 25    The bill provides for county sobriety monitoring pilot
 14 26 programs. The bill allows the department of public health
 14 27 (DPH), in collaboration with the department of corrections,
 14 28 the department of public safety, and the DOT, to approve
 14 29 applications from counties for countywide sobriety monitoring
 14 30 pilot programs. The programs are to be available 24 hours per
 14 31 day, seven days per week, in an effort to reduce the number
 14 32 of crimes related to OWI.  One application shall be approved
 14 33 for a county with a population of 200,000 people or more, one
 14 34 application shall be approved for a county with a population of
 14 35 100,000 people or more but less than 200,000 people, and one
 15  1 application shall be approved for a county with a population of
 15  2 less than 100,000 people.
 15  3    The programs shall require individuals charged with or
 15  4 convicted of OWI to abstain from all chemical substances for
 15  5 a period of time. The programs are to require testing to
 15  6 determine whether a chemical substance is present at least
 15  7 twice per day at a central location where an immediate sanction
 15  8 can be applied or, where such testing is impractical, by
 15  9 continuous transdermal or electronic monitoring. The programs
 15 10 shall also apply sanctions when test results definitively
 15 11 indicate the presence of a chemical substance. The programs
 15 12 shall require participants to pay program costs and to install
 15 13 an ignition interlock device.
 15 14    A court in a county that has established a pilot program
 15 15 may order a defendant, as a condition of pretrial release,
 15 16 probation, or bond, to participate in the program. Approved
 15 17 pilot programs shall begin January 15, 2017, or upon the
 15 18 effective date of DPH rules, whichever is earlier, and shall
 15 19 be conducted for a minimum of one year. The DPH is to adopt
 15 20 rules to implement the programs, including but not limited to
 15 21 provisions relating to applications for, approval of, costs of,
 15 22 and oversight of the pilot programs and reporting requirements
 15 23 for participating counties. The DPH is directed to submit
 15 24 a report on the results of the pilot programs and make
 15 25 recommendations to the general assembly by December 15, 2018.

  9 25 this chapter and a test was refused, the device shall be
  9 26 uninstalled one hundred eighty days after the later of the
  9 27 following:
  9 28    (a)  The date the defendant's license revocation period
  9 29 ends.
  9 30    (b)  The date the defendant last failed a test or retest
  9 31 by the device because the defendant's alcohol concentration
  9 32 exceeded the limit established under 661 IAC 158.6.
  9 33    (c)  The date the defendant last failed to maintain the
  9 34 device as required by 661 IAC ch. 158.
  9 35    b.  An ignition interlock device shall not be uninstalled
 10  1 under this section if the defendant has been convicted of
 10  2 a second or subsequent violation of section 321J.2, if the
 10  3 defendant's license has been revoked for a second or subsequent
 10  4 time under this chapter, or if the defendant has been convicted
 10  5 of tampering with or circumventing an ignition interlock
 10  6 device.
 10  7    c.  The department of public safety, in consultation with the
 10  8 department, may adopt rules to administer this subsection.
 10  9    2.  a.  An ignition interlock indigent user fund is created
 10 10 in the state treasury. The fund shall be administered by
 10 11 the department and shall consist of moneys collected by the
 10 12 department under this subsection. The moneys in the fund are
 10 13 appropriated to and shall be used by the department to assist
 10 14 indigent users of ignition interlock devices in paying for the
 10 15 use of the devices. Notwithstanding section 8.33, moneys in
 10 16 the fund at the end of each fiscal year shall not revert to any
 10 17 other fund but shall remain in the fund for expenditure for
 10 18 subsequent fiscal years.
 10 19    b.  Each month, the department shall assess an ignition
 10 20 interlock user fee to each user of an ignition interlock
 10 21 device. All ignition interlock user fees shall be collected by
 10 22 the department and deposited in the ignition interlock indigent
 10 23 user fund. The amount of the monthly ignition interlock user
 10 24 fee shall be set by the department so that the moneys in the
 10 25 ignition interlock indigent user fund are sufficient to assist
 10 26 all indigent users of ignition interlock devices in paying for
 10 27 the use of the devices.
 10 28    c.  A person is indigent for the purposes of this subsection
 10 29 if any of the following apply:
 10 30    (1)  The person has an income level at or below one hundred
 10 31 twenty=five percent of the United States poverty level as
 10 32 defined by the most recently revised poverty income guidelines
 10 33 published by the United States department of health and human
 10 34 services, and the department determines that the person is
 10 35 unable to pay for the cost of an ignition interlock device. In
 11  1 making the determination of a person's ability to pay for the
 11  2 cost of a device, the department shall consider not only the
 11  3 person's income, but also the person's other assets, including
 11  4 but not limited to cash, stocks, bonds, and any other property.
 11  5    (2)  The person has an income level greater than one hundred
 11  6 twenty=five percent, but at or below two hundred percent, of
 11  7 the most recently revised poverty income guidelines published
 11  8 by the United States department of health and human services,
 11  9 and the department determines that paying for the ignition
 11 10 interlock device would cause the person substantial hardship.
 11 11 In determining whether substantial hardship would result, the
 11 12 department shall consider not only the person's income, but
 11 13 also the person's other assets, including but not limited to
 11 14 cash, stocks, bonds, and any other property.
 11 15    d.  The department shall adopt rules to administer this
 11 16 subsection, including but not limited to the manner used to
 11 17 determine the monthly ignition interlock user fee and the
 11 18 accepted form and manner in which a person may demonstrate
 11 19 indigency.
 11 20    Sec. 15.  SOBRIETY MONITORING PILOT PROGRAMS.
 11 21    1.  The department of public health, in collaboration
 11 22 with the department of corrections, the department of public
 11 23 safety, and the department of transportation, may approve an
 11 24 application from a county for a countywide sobriety monitoring
 11 25 pilot program that is available twenty=four hours per day,
 11 26 seven days per week, in an effort to reduce the number of
 11 27 crimes related to operating while intoxicated. One application
 11 28 shall be approved for a county with a population of two hundred
 11 29 thousand people or more, one application shall be approved
 11 30 for a county with a population of one hundred thousand people
 11 31 or more but less than two hundred thousand people, and one
 11 32 application shall be approved for a county with a population of
 11 33 less than one hundred thousand people.
 11 34    2.  A sobriety monitoring pilot program shall do all of the
 11 35 following:
 12  1    a.  Require a person who has been charged with, pled guilty
 12  2 to, or been convicted of a violation of section 321J.2 to
 12  3 abstain from all chemical substances for a period of time.
 12  4    b.  Require the person to be subject to testing to determine
 12  5 whether a chemical substance is present in the person's body
 12  6 in the following manner:
 12  7    (1)  At least twice per day at a central location where an
 12  8 immediate sanction can be applied.
 12  9    (2)  Where testing under subparagraph (1) is impractical, by
 12 10 continuous transdermal or electronic monitoring.
 12 11    c.  Apply sanctions when test results definitively, and
 12 12 without presumption, indicate the presence of chemical
 12 13 substances.
 12 14    d.  Require a person participating in the program to pay
 12 15 program costs, including costs of installation, monitoring, and
 12 16 deactivation of any testing devices.
 12 17    e.  Require the person to install an ignition interlock
 12 18 device of a type approved by the commissioner of public safety
 12 19 on all vehicles owned or operated by the person, and require
 12 20 the person to pay the costs associated with the installation
 12 21 and use of the ignition interlock device.
 12 22    3.  A court in a county that has established a pilot program
 12 23 pursuant to this section may order a defendant, as a condition
 12 24 of pretrial release, probation, or bond, to participate in the
 12 25 program.
 12 26    4.  An approved pilot program shall begin on January 15,
 12 27 2017, or upon the effective date of department rules, whichever
 12 28 is earlier, and shall be conducted for a minimum of one year.
 12 29    5.  The department of public health shall adopt rules
 12 30 pursuant to chapter 17A to implement this section including
 12 31 but not limited to provisions relating to applications for,
 12 32 approval of, costs of, and oversight of the pilot programs and
 12 33 reporting requirements for participating counties.
 12 34    6.  The department of public health shall submit a report on
 12 35 the results of the pilot programs and make recommendations to
 13  1 the general assembly by December 15, 2018.
 13  2    7.  For the purposes of this section, "chemical substance"
 13  3 means alcohol, wine, spirits, and beer as defined in section
 13  4 123.3 and controlled substances as defined in section 124.101.
 13  5                           EXPLANATION
 13  6 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
 13  7 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
 13  8    Current law requires a person guilty of operating while
 13  9 intoxicated (OWI) to install an ignition interlock device in
 13 10 the person's vehicle if the person seeks a temporary restricted
 13 11 license, unless the person's alcohol concentration was less
 13 12 than .10 and no accident occurred. This bill strikes that
 13 13 exception, and also requires a person guilty of OWI to install
 13 14 an ignition interlock device in the person's vehicle upon the
 13 15 revocation of the person's driver's license rather than upon
 13 16 the person's application for a temporary restricted license.
 13 17    Under current law, an ignition interlock device is required
 13 18 to be installed in a person's vehicle for the period of time
 13 19 for which the person's temporary restricted license is issued,
 13 20 and up to one additional year after license reinstatement if
 13 21 the person has two or more OWI revocations. The bill requires
 13 22 the permanent installation of an ignition interlock device with
 13 23 two exceptions. If the ignition interlock device was installed
 13 24 as a result of the person's first OWI offense or revocation and
 13 25 a test was obtained, the device shall be uninstalled 180 days
 13 26 after the person's license was revoked, the person last failed
 13 27 a test by the ignition interlock device, or the defendant last
 13 28 failed to maintain the device as required, whichever is latest.
 13 29 If the ignition interlock device was installed as a result of
 13 30 the person's first OWI offense or revocation and a test was
 13 31 refused, the device shall be uninstalled 180 days after the
 13 32 person's license revocation period is over, the person last
 13 33 failed a test by the ignition interlock device, or the person
 13 34 last failed to maintain the device as required, whichever is
 13 35 latest.
 14  1 The bill provides an ignition interlock device shall not
 14  2 be uninstalled if the person has been convicted of a second
 14  3 or subsequent OWI violation, if the person's license has been
 14  4 revoked for a second or subsequent time, or if the person has
 14  5 been convicted of tampering with or circumventing an ignition
 14  6 interlock device.
 14  7    The bill requires the department of transportation (DOT)
 14  8 to assess a monthly ignition interlock user fee to each user
 14  9 of an ignition interlock device. All ignition interlock user
 14 10 fees will be collected by the DOT and deposited in an ignition
 14 11 interlock indigent user fund (IIIUF). The bill requires the
 14 12 DOT to use the moneys in the IIIUF to assist indigent users
 14 13 of ignition interlock devices in paying for the use of the
 14 14 devices. The amount of the monthly ignition interlock user fee
 14 15 shall be set by the DOT so that the moneys in the IIIUF are
 14 16 sufficient to assist all indigent users of ignition interlock
 14 17 devices in paying for the use of the devices.
 14 18    Under the bill, a person is indigent if the person has an
 14 19 income level at or below 125 percent of the U.S. poverty level
 14 20 and the person is unable to pay for the cost of an ignition
 14 21 interlock device. A person is also indigent if the person has
 14 22 an income level greater than 125 percent, but at or below 200
 14 23 percent, of the U.S. poverty level and paying for the ignition
 14 24 interlock device would cause the person substantial hardship.
 14 25    The bill provides for county sobriety monitoring pilot
 14 26 programs. The bill allows the department of public health
 14 27 (DPH), in collaboration with the department of corrections,
 14 28 the department of public safety, and the DOT, to approve
 14 29 applications from counties for countywide sobriety monitoring
 14 30 pilot programs. The programs are to be available 24 hours per
 14 31 day, seven days per week, in an effort to reduce the number
 14 32 of crimes related to OWI.  One application shall be approved
 14 33 for a county with a population of 200,000 people or more, one
 14 34 application shall be approved for a county with a population of
 14 35 100,000 people or more but less than 200,000 people, and one
 15  1 application shall be approved for a county with a population of
 15  2 less than 100,000 people.
 15  3    The programs shall require individuals charged with or
 15  4 convicted of OWI to abstain from all chemical substances for
 15  5 a period of time. The programs are to require testing to
 15  6 determine whether a chemical substance is present at least
 15  7 twice per day at a central location where an immediate sanction
 15  8 can be applied or, where such testing is impractical, by
 15  9 continuous transdermal or electronic monitoring. The programs
 15 10 shall also apply sanctions when test results definitively
 15 11 indicate the presence of a chemical substance. The programs
 15 12 shall require participants to pay program costs and to install
 15 13 an ignition interlock device.
 15 14    A court in a county that has established a pilot program
 15 15 may order a defendant, as a condition of pretrial release,
 15 16 probation, or bond, to participate in the program. Approved
 15 17 pilot programs shall begin January 15, 2017, or upon the
 15 18 effective date of DPH rules, whichever is earlier, and shall
 15 19 be conducted for a minimum of one year. The DPH is to adopt
 15 20 rules to implement the programs, including but not limited to
 15 21 provisions relating to applications for, approval of, costs of,
 15 22 and oversight of the pilot programs and reporting requirements
 15 23 for participating counties. The DPH is directed to submit
 15 24 a report on the results of the pilot programs and make
 15 25 recommendations to the general assembly by December 15, 2018.

 10 17 other fund but shall remain in the fund for expenditure for
 10 18 subsequent fiscal years.
 10 19    b.  Each month, the department shall assess an ignition
 10 20 interlock user fee to each user of an ignition interlock
 10 21 device. All ignition interlock user fees shall be collected by
 10 22 the department and deposited in the ignition interlock indigent
 10 23 user fund. The amount of the monthly ignition interlock user
 10 24 fee shall be set by the department so that the moneys in the
 10 25 ignition interlock indigent user fund are sufficient to assist
 10 26 all indigent users of ignition interlock devices in paying for
 10 27 the use of the devices.
 10 28    c.  A person is indigent for the purposes of this subsection
 10 29 if any of the following apply:

 13  4 123.3 and controlled substances as defined in section 124.101.
 13  5                           EXPLANATION
 13  6 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
 13  7 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
 13  8    Current law requires a person guilty of operating while
 13  9 intoxicated (OWI) to install an ignition interlock device in
 13 10 the person's vehicle if the person seeks a temporary restricted
 13 11 license, unless the person's alcohol concentration was less

 13 17    Under current law, an ignition interlock device is required
 13 18 to be installed in a person's vehicle for the period of time
 13 19 for which the person's temporary restricted license is issued,

 13 24 as a result of the person's first OWI offense or revocation and
 13 25 a test was obtained, the device shall be uninstalled 180 days
 13 26 after the person's license was revoked, the person last failed
 13 27 a test by the ignition interlock device, or the defendant last
 13 28 failed to maintain the device as required, whichever is latest.
 13 29 If the ignition interlock device was installed as a result of
 13 30 the person's first OWI offense or revocation and a test was
 13 31 refused, the device shall be uninstalled 180 days after the
 13 32 person's license revocation period is over, the person last
 13 33 failed a test by the ignition interlock device, or the person
 13 34 last failed to maintain the device as required, whichever is
 13 35 latest.
 14  1 The bill provides an ignition interlock device shall not
 14  2 be uninstalled if the person has been convicted of a second
 14  3 or subsequent OWI violation, if the person's license has been
 14  4 revoked for a second or subsequent time, or if the person has
 14  5 been convicted of tampering with or circumventing an ignition
 14  6 interlock device.
 14  7    The bill requires the department of transportation (DOT)
 14  8 to assess a monthly ignition interlock user fee to each user
 14  9 of an ignition interlock device. All ignition interlock user
 14 10 fees will be collected by the DOT and deposited in an ignition
 14 11 interlock indigent user fund (IIIUF). The bill requires the
 14 12 DOT to use the moneys in the IIIUF to assist indigent users

 14 15 shall be set by the DOT so that the moneys in the IIIUF are
 14 16 sufficient to assist all indigent users of ignition interlock
 14 17 devices in paying for the use of the devices.
 14 18    Under the bill, a person is indigent if the person has an
 14 19 income level at or below 125 percent of the U.S. poverty level
 14 20 and the person is unable to pay for the cost of an ignition
 14 21 interlock device. A person is also indigent if the person has
 14 22 an income level greater than 125 percent, but at or below 200
 14 23 percent, of the U.S. poverty level and paying for the ignition
 14 24 interlock device would cause the person substantial hardship.
 14 25    The bill provides for county sobriety monitoring pilot
 14 26 programs. The bill allows the department of public health
 14 27 (DPH), in collaboration with the department of corrections,
 14 28 the department of public safety, and the DOT, to approve
 14 29 applications from counties for countywide sobriety monitoring
 14 30 pilot programs. The programs are to be available 24 hours per
 14 31 day, seven days per week, in an effort to reduce the number
 14 32 of crimes related to OWI.  One application shall be approved
 14 33 for a county with a population of 200,000 people or more, one
 14 34 application shall be approved for a county with a population of
 14 35 100,000 people or more but less than 200,000 people, and one
 15  1 application shall be approved for a county with a population of
 15  2 less than 100,000 people.
 15  3    The programs shall require individuals charged with or
 15  4 convicted of OWI to abstain from all chemical substances for
 15  5 a period of time. The programs are to require testing to
 15  6 determine whether a chemical substance is present at least
 15  7 twice per day at a central location where an immediate sanction
 15  8 can be applied or, where such testing is impractical, by
 15  9 continuous transdermal or electronic monitoring. The programs
 15 10 shall also apply sanctions when test results definitively
 15 11 indicate the presence of a chemical substance. The programs
 15 12 shall require participants to pay program costs and to install
 15 13 an ignition interlock device.
 15 14    A court in a county that has established a pilot program
 15 15 may order a defendant, as a condition of pretrial release,
 15 16 probation, or bond, to participate in the program. Approved
 15 17 pilot programs shall begin January 15, 2017, or upon the
 15 18 effective date of DPH rules, whichever is earlier, and shall
 15 19 be conducted for a minimum of one year. The DPH is to adopt
 15 20 rules to implement the programs, including but not limited to
 15 21 provisions relating to applications for, approval of, costs of,
 15 22 and oversight of the pilot programs and reporting requirements
 15 23 for participating counties. The DPH is directed to submit
 15 24 a report on the results of the pilot programs and make
 15 25 recommendations to the general assembly by December 15, 2018.

 11 20    Sec. 15.  SOBRIETY MONITORING PILOT PROGRAMS.
 11 21    1.  The department of public health, in collaboration
 11 22 with the department of corrections, the department of public
 11 23 safety, and the department of transportation, may approve an
 11 24 application from a county for a countywide sobriety monitoring
 11 25 pilot program that is available twenty=four hours per day,
 11 26 seven days per week, in an effort to reduce the number of
 11 27 crimes related to operating while intoxicated. One application
 11 28 shall be approved for a county with a population of two hundred
 11 29 thousand people or more, one application shall be approved
 11 30 for a county with a population of one hundred thousand people
 11 31 or more but less than two hundred thousand people, and one
 11 32 application shall be approved for a county with a population of
 11 33 less than one hundred thousand people.
 11 34    2.  A sobriety monitoring pilot program shall do all of the
 11 35 following:
 12  1    a.  Require a person who has been charged with, pled guilty
 12  2 to, or been convicted of a violation of section 321J.2 to
 12  3 abstain from all chemical substances for a period of time.
 12  4    b.  Require the person to be subject to testing to determine
 12  5 whether a chemical substance is present in the person's body
 12  6 in the following manner:
 12  7    (1)  At least twice per day at a central location where an
 12  8 immediate sanction can be applied.
 12  9    (2)  Where testing under subparagraph (1) is impractical, by
 12 10 continuous transdermal or electronic monitoring.
 12 11    c.  Apply sanctions when test results definitively, and
 12 12 without presumption, indicate the presence of chemical
 12 13 substances.
 12 14    d.  Require a person participating in the program to pay
 12 15 program costs, including costs of installation, monitoring, and
 12 16 deactivation of any testing devices.
 12 17    e.  Require the person to install an ignition interlock
 12 18 device of a type approved by the commissioner of public safety
 12 19 on all vehicles owned or operated by the person, and require
 12 20 the person to pay the costs associated with the installation
 12 21 and use of the ignition interlock device.
 12 22    3.  A court in a county that has established a pilot program
 12 23 pursuant to this section may order a defendant, as a condition
 12 24 of pretrial release, probation, or bond, to participate in the
 12 25 program.
 12 26    4.  An approved pilot program shall begin on January 15,
 12 27 2017, or upon the effective date of department rules, whichever
 12 28 is earlier, and shall be conducted for a minimum of one year.
 12 29    5.  The department of public health shall adopt rules
 12 30 pursuant to chapter 17A to implement this section including
 12 31 but not limited to provisions relating to applications for,
 12 32 approval of, costs of, and oversight of the pilot programs and
 12 33 reporting requirements for participating counties.
 12 34    6.  The department of public health shall submit a report on
 12 35 the results of the pilot programs and make recommendations to
 13  1 the general assembly by December 15, 2018.
 13  2    7.  For the purposes of this section, "chemical substance"
 13  3 means alcohol, wine, spirits, and beer as defined in section
 13  4 123.3 and controlled substances as defined in section 124.101.
 13  5                           EXPLANATION
 13  6 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
 13  7 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
 13  8    Current law requires a person guilty of operating while
 13  9 intoxicated (OWI) to install an ignition interlock device in
 13 10 the person's vehicle if the person seeks a temporary restricted
 13 11 license, unless the person's alcohol concentration was less
 13 12 than .10 and no accident occurred. This bill strikes that
 13 13 exception, and also requires a person guilty of OWI to install
 13 14 an ignition interlock device in the person's vehicle upon the
 13 15 revocation of the person's driver's license rather than upon
 13 16 the person's application for a temporary restricted license.
 13 17    Under current law, an ignition interlock device is required
 13 18 to be installed in a person's vehicle for the period of time
 13 19 for which the person's temporary restricted license is issued,
 13 20 and up to one additional year after license reinstatement if
 13 21 the person has two or more OWI revocations. The bill requires
 13 22 the permanent installation of an ignition interlock device with
 13 23 two exceptions. If the ignition interlock device was installed
 13 24 as a result of the person's first OWI offense or revocation and
 13 25 a test was obtained, the device shall be uninstalled 180 days
 13 26 after the person's license was revoked, the person last failed
 13 27 a test by the ignition interlock device, or the defendant last
 13 28 failed to maintain the device as required, whichever is latest.
 13 29 If the ignition interlock device was installed as a result of
 13 30 the person's first OWI offense or revocation and a test was
 13 31 refused, the device shall be uninstalled 180 days after the
 13 32 person's license revocation period is over, the person last
 13 33 failed a test by the ignition interlock device, or the person
 13 34 last failed to maintain the device as required, whichever is
 13 35 latest.
 14  1 The bill provides an ignition interlock device shall not
 14  2 be uninstalled if the person has been convicted of a second
 14  3 or subsequent OWI violation, if the person's license has been
 14  4 revoked for a second or subsequent time, or if the person has
 14  5 been convicted of tampering with or circumventing an ignition
 14  6 interlock device.
 14  7    The bill requires the department of transportation (DOT)
 14  8 to assess a monthly ignition interlock user fee to each user
 14  9 of an ignition interlock device. All ignition interlock user
 14 10 fees will be collected by the DOT and deposited in an ignition
 14 11 interlock indigent user fund (IIIUF). The bill requires the
 14 12 DOT to use the moneys in the IIIUF to assist indigent users
 14 13 of ignition interlock devices in paying for the use of the
 14 14 devices. The amount of the monthly ignition interlock user fee
 14 15 shall be set by the DOT so that the moneys in the IIIUF are
 14 16 sufficient to assist all indigent users of ignition interlock
 14 17 devices in paying for the use of the devices.
 14 18    Under the bill, a person is indigent if the person has an
 14 19 income level at or below 125 percent of the U.S. poverty level
 14 20 and the person is unable to pay for the cost of an ignition
 14 21 interlock device. A person is also indigent if the person has
 14 22 an income level greater than 125 percent, but at or below 200
 14 23 percent, of the U.S. poverty level and paying for the ignition
 14 24 interlock device would cause the person substantial hardship.
 14 25    The bill provides for county sobriety monitoring pilot
 14 26 programs. The bill allows the department of public health
 14 27 (DPH), in collaboration with the department of corrections,
 14 28 the department of public safety, and the DOT, to approve
 14 29 applications from counties for countywide sobriety monitoring
 14 30 pilot programs. The programs are to be available 24 hours per
 14 31 day, seven days per week, in an effort to reduce the number
 14 32 of crimes related to OWI.  One application shall be approved
 14 33 for a county with a population of 200,000 people or more, one
 14 34 application shall be approved for a county with a population of
 14 35 100,000 people or more but less than 200,000 people, and one
 15  1 application shall be approved for a county with a population of
 15  2 less than 100,000 people.
 15  3    The programs shall require individuals charged with or
 15  4 convicted of OWI to abstain from all chemical substances for
 15  5 a period of time. The programs are to require testing to
 15  6 determine whether a chemical substance is present at least
 15  7 twice per day at a central location where an immediate sanction
 15  8 can be applied or, where such testing is impractical, by
 15  9 continuous transdermal or electronic monitoring. The programs
 15 10 shall also apply sanctions when test results definitively
 15 11 indicate the presence of a chemical substance. The programs
 15 12 shall require participants to pay program costs and to install
 15 13 an ignition interlock device.
 15 14    A court in a county that has established a pilot program
 15 15 may order a defendant, as a condition of pretrial release,
 15 16 probation, or bond, to participate in the program. Approved
 15 17 pilot programs shall begin January 15, 2017, or upon the
 15 18 effective date of DPH rules, whichever is earlier, and shall
 15 19 be conducted for a minimum of one year. The DPH is to adopt
 15 20 rules to implement the programs, including but not limited to
 15 21 provisions relating to applications for, approval of, costs of,
 15 22 and oversight of the pilot programs and reporting requirements
 15 23 for participating counties. The DPH is directed to submit
 15 24 a report on the results of the pilot programs and make
 15 25 recommendations to the general assembly by December 15, 2018.

 13 19 for which the person's temporary restricted license is issued,

 13 21 the person has two or more OWI revocations. The bill requires
 13 22 the permanent installation of an ignition interlock device with
 13 23 two exceptions. If the ignition interlock device was installed
 13 24 as a result of the person's first OWI offense or revocation and
 13 25 a test was obtained, the device shall be uninstalled 180 days
 13 26 after the person's license was revoked, the person last failed
 13 27 a test by the ignition interlock device, or the defendant last
 13 28 failed to maintain the device as required, whichever is latest.
 13 29 If the ignition interlock device was installed as a result of
 13 30 the person's first OWI offense or revocation and a test was
 13 31 refused, the device shall be uninstalled 180 days after the
 13 32 person's license revocation period is over, the person last
 13 33 failed a test by the ignition interlock device, or the person
 13 34 last failed to maintain the device as required, whichever is
 13 35 latest.
 14  1 The bill provides an ignition interlock device shall not
 14  2 be uninstalled if the person has been convicted of a second
 14  3 or subsequent OWI violation, if the person's license has been
 14  4 revoked for a second or subsequent time, or if the person has
 14  5 been convicted of tampering with or circumventing an ignition
 14  6 interlock device.
 14  7    The bill requires the department of transportation (DOT)
 14  8 to assess a monthly ignition interlock user fee to each user
 14  9 of an ignition interlock device. All ignition interlock user
 14 10 fees will be collected by the DOT and deposited in an ignition
 14 11 interlock indigent user fund (IIIUF). The bill requires the
 14 12 DOT to use the moneys in the IIIUF to assist indigent users
 14 13 of ignition interlock devices in paying for the use of the
 14 14 devices. The amount of the monthly ignition interlock user fee
 14 15 shall be set by the DOT so that the moneys in the IIIUF are
 14 16 sufficient to assist all indigent users of ignition interlock
 14 17 devices in paying for the use of the devices.
 14 18    Under the bill, a person is indigent if the person has an
 14 19 income level at or below 125 percent of the U.S. poverty level
 14 20 and the person is unable to pay for the cost of an ignition
 14 21 interlock device. A person is also indigent if the person has
 14 22 an income level greater than 125 percent, but at or below 200
 14 23 percent, of the U.S. poverty level and paying for the ignition
 14 24 interlock device would cause the person substantial hardship.
 14 25    The bill provides for county sobriety monitoring pilot
 14 26 programs. The bill allows the department of public health
 14 27 (DPH), in collaboration with the department of corrections,
 14 28 the department of public safety, and the DOT, to approve
 14 29 applications from counties for countywide sobriety monitoring
 14 30 pilot programs. The programs are to be available 24 hours per
 14 31 day, seven days per week, in an effort to reduce the number
 14 32 of crimes related to OWI.  One application shall be approved
 14 33 for a county with a population of 200,000 people or more, one
 14 34 application shall be approved for a county with a population of
 14 35 100,000 people or more but less than 200,000 people, and one
 15  1 application shall be approved for a county with a population of
 15  2 less than 100,000 people.
 15  3    The programs shall require individuals charged with or
 15  4 convicted of OWI to abstain from all chemical substances for
 15  5 a period of time. The programs are to require testing to
 15  6 determine whether a chemical substance is present at least
 15  7 twice per day at a central location where an immediate sanction
 15  8 can be applied or, where such testing is impractical, by
 15  9 continuous transdermal or electronic monitoring. The programs
 15 10 shall also apply sanctions when test results definitively
 15 11 indicate the presence of a chemical substance. The programs
 15 12 shall require participants to pay program costs and to install
 15 13 an ignition interlock device.
 15 14    A court in a county that has established a pilot program
 15 15 may order a defendant, as a condition of pretrial release,
 15 16 probation, or bond, to participate in the program. Approved
 15 17 pilot programs shall begin January 15, 2017, or upon the
 15 18 effective date of DPH rules, whichever is earlier, and shall
 15 19 be conducted for a minimum of one year. The DPH is to adopt
 15 20 rules to implement the programs, including but not limited to
 15 21 provisions relating to applications for, approval of, costs of,
 15 22 and oversight of the pilot programs and reporting requirements
 15 23 for participating counties. The DPH is directed to submit
 15 24 a report on the results of the pilot programs and make
 15 25 recommendations to the general assembly by December 15, 2018.

 10 10 in the state treasury. The fund shall be administered by
 10 11 the department and shall consist of moneys collected by the
 10 12 department under this subsection. The moneys in the fund are
 10 13 appropriated to and shall be used by the department to assist
 10 14 indigent users of ignition interlock devices in paying for the
 10 15 use of the devices. Notwithstanding section 8.33, moneys in
 10 16 the fund at the end of each fiscal year shall not revert to any
 10 17 other fund but shall remain in the fund for expenditure for
 10 18 subsequent fiscal years.
 10 19    b.  Each month, the department shall assess an ignition
 10 20 interlock user fee to each user of an ignition interlock
 10 21 device. All ignition interlock user fees shall be collected by
 10 22 the department and deposited in the ignition interlock indigent
 10 23 user fund. The amount of the monthly ignition interlock user
 10 24 fee shall be set by the department so that the moneys in the
 10 25 ignition interlock indigent user fund are sufficient to assist
 10 26 all indigent users of ignition interlock devices in paying for
 10 27 the use of the devices.
 10 28    c.  A person is indigent for the purposes of this subsection
 10 29 if any of the following apply:
 10 30    (1)  The person has an income level at or below one hundred
 10 31 twenty=five percent of the United States poverty level as
 10 32 defined by the most recently revised poverty income guidelines
 10 33 published by the United States department of health and human
 10 34 services, and the department determines that the person is
 10 35 unable to pay for the cost of an ignition interlock device. In
 11  1 making the determination of a person's ability to pay for the
 11  2 cost of a device, the department shall consider not only the
 11  3 person's income, but also the person's other assets, including
 11  4 but not limited to cash, stocks, bonds, and any other property.
 11  5    (2)  The person has an income level greater than one hundred
 11  6 twenty=five percent, but at or below two hundred percent, of
 11  7 the most recently revised poverty income guidelines published
 11  8 by the United States department of health and human services,
 11  9 and the department determines that paying for the ignition
 11 10 interlock device would cause the person substantial hardship.
 11 11 In determining whether substantial hardship would result, the
 11 12 department shall consider not only the person's income, but
 11 13 also the person's other assets, including but not limited to
 11 14 cash, stocks, bonds, and any other property.
 11 15    d.  The department shall adopt rules to administer this
 11 16 subsection, including but not limited to the manner used to
 11 17 determine the monthly ignition interlock user fee and the
 11 18 accepted form and manner in which a person may demonstrate
 11 19 indigency.
 11 20    Sec. 15.  SOBRIETY MONITORING PILOT PROGRAMS.
 11 21    1.  The department of public health, in collaboration
 11 22 with the department of corrections, the department of public
 11 23 safety, and the department of transportation, may approve an
 11 24 application from a county for a countywide sobriety monitoring
 11 25 pilot program that is available twenty=four hours per day,
 11 26 seven days per week, in an effort to reduce the number of
 11 27 crimes related to operating while intoxicated. One application
 11 28 shall be approved for a county with a population of two hundred
 11 29 thousand people or more, one application shall be approved
 11 30 for a county with a population of one hundred thousand people
 11 31 or more but less than two hundred thousand people, and one
 11 32 application shall be approved for a county with a population of
 11 33 less than one hundred thousand people.
 11 34    2.  A sobriety monitoring pilot program shall do all of the
 11 35 following:
 12  1    a.  Require a person who has been charged with, pled guilty
 12  2 to, or been convicted of a violation of section 321J.2 to
 12  3 abstain from all chemical substances for a period of time.
 12  4    b.  Require the person to be subject to testing to determine
 12  5 whether a chemical substance is present in the person's body
 12  6 in the following manner:
 12  7    (1)  At least twice per day at a central location where an
 12  8 immediate sanction can be applied.
 12  9    (2)  Where testing under subparagraph (1) is impractical, by
 12 10 continuous transdermal or electronic monitoring.
 12 11    c.  Apply sanctions when test results definitively, and
 12 12 without presumption, indicate the presence of chemical
 12 13 substances.
 12 14    d.  Require a person participating in the program to pay
 12 15 program costs, including costs of installation, monitoring, and
 12 16 deactivation of any testing devices.
 12 17    e.  Require the person to install an ignition interlock
 12 18 device of a type approved by the commissioner of public safety
 12 19 on all vehicles owned or operated by the person, and require
 12 20 the person to pay the costs associated with the installation
 12 21 and use of the ignition interlock device.
 12 22    3.  A court in a county that has established a pilot program
 12 23 pursuant to this section may order a defendant, as a condition
 12 24 of pretrial release, probation, or bond, to participate in the
 12 25 program.
 12 26    4.  An approved pilot program shall begin on January 15,
 12 27 2017, or upon the effective date of department rules, whichever
 12 28 is earlier, and shall be conducted for a minimum of one year.
 12 29    5.  The department of public health shall adopt rules
 12 30 pursuant to chapter 17A to implement this section including
 12 31 but not limited to provisions relating to applications for,
 12 32 approval of, costs of, and oversight of the pilot programs and
 12 33 reporting requirements for participating counties.
 12 34    6.  The department of public health shall submit a report on
 12 35 the results of the pilot programs and make recommendations to
 13  1 the general assembly by December 15, 2018.
 13  2    7.  For the purposes of this section, "chemical substance"
 13  3 means alcohol, wine, spirits, and beer as defined in section
 13  4 123.3 and controlled substances as defined in section 124.101.
 13  5                           EXPLANATION
 13  6 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
 13  7 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
 13  8    Current law requires a person guilty of operating while
 13  9 intoxicated (OWI) to install an ignition interlock device in
 13 10 the person's vehicle if the person seeks a temporary restricted
 13 11 license, unless the person's alcohol concentration was less
 13 12 than .10 and no accident occurred. This bill strikes that
 13 13 exception, and also requires a person guilty of OWI to install
 13 14 an ignition interlock device in the person's vehicle upon the
 13 15 revocation of the person's driver's license rather than upon
 13 16 the person's application for a temporary restricted license.
 13 17    Under current law, an ignition interlock device is required
 13 18 to be installed in a person's vehicle for the period of time
 13 19 for which the person's temporary restricted license is issued,
 13 20 and up to one additional year after license reinstatement if
 13 21 the person has two or more OWI revocations. The bill requires
 13 22 the permanent installation of an ignition interlock device with
 13 23 two exceptions. If the ignition interlock device was installed
 13 24 as a result of the person's first OWI offense or revocation and
 13 25 a test was obtained, the device shall be uninstalled 180 days
 13 26 after the person's license was revoked, the person last failed
 13 27 a test by the ignition interlock device, or the defendant last
 13 28 failed to maintain the device as required, whichever is latest.
 13 29 If the ignition interlock device was installed as a result of
 13 30 the person's first OWI offense or revocation and a test was
 13 31 refused, the device shall be uninstalled 180 days after the
 13 32 person's license revocation period is over, the person last
 13 33 failed a test by the ignition interlock device, or the person
 13 34 last failed to maintain the device as required, whichever is
 13 35 latest.
 14  1 The bill provides an ignition interlock device shall not
 14  2 be uninstalled if the person has been convicted of a second
 14  3 or subsequent OWI violation, if the person's license has been
 14  4 revoked for a second or subsequent time, or if the person has
 14  5 been convicted of tampering with or circumventing an ignition
 14  6 interlock device.
 14  7    The bill requires the department of transportation (DOT)
 14  8 to assess a monthly ignition interlock user fee to each user
 14  9 of an ignition interlock device. All ignition interlock user
 14 10 fees will be collected by the DOT and deposited in an ignition
 14 11 interlock indigent user fund (IIIUF). The bill requires the
 14 12 DOT to use the moneys in the IIIUF to assist indigent users
 14 13 of ignition interlock devices in paying for the use of the
 14 14 devices. The amount of the monthly ignition interlock user fee
 14 15 shall be set by the DOT so that the moneys in the IIIUF are
 14 16 sufficient to assist all indigent users of ignition interlock
 14 17 devices in paying for the use of the devices.
 14 18    Under the bill, a person is indigent if the person has an
 14 19 income level at or below 125 percent of the U.S. poverty level
 14 20 and the person is unable to pay for the cost of an ignition
 14 21 interlock device. A person is also indigent if the person has
 14 22 an income level greater than 125 percent, but at or below 200
 14 23 percent, of the U.S. poverty level and paying for the ignition
 14 24 interlock device would cause the person substantial hardship.
 14 25    The bill provides for county sobriety monitoring pilot
 14 26 programs. The bill allows the department of public health
 14 27 (DPH), in collaboration with the department of corrections,
 14 28 the department of public safety, and the DOT, to approve
 14 29 applications from counties for countywide sobriety monitoring
 14 30 pilot programs. The programs are to be available 24 hours per
 14 31 day, seven days per week, in an effort to reduce the number
 14 32 of crimes related to OWI.  One application shall be approved
 14 33 for a county with a population of 200,000 people or more, one
 14 34 application shall be approved for a county with a population of
 14 35 100,000 people or more but less than 200,000 people, and one
 15  1 application shall be approved for a county with a population of
 15  2 less than 100,000 people.
 15  3    The programs shall require individuals charged with or
 15  4 convicted of OWI to abstain from all chemical substances for
 15  5 a period of time. The programs are to require testing to
 15  6 determine whether a chemical substance is present at least
 15  7 twice per day at a central location where an immediate sanction
 15  8 can be applied or, where such testing is impractical, by
 15  9 continuous transdermal or electronic monitoring. The programs
 15 10 shall also apply sanctions when test results definitively
 15 11 indicate the presence of a chemical substance. The programs
 15 12 shall require participants to pay program costs and to install
 15 13 an ignition interlock device.
 15 14    A court in a county that has established a pilot program
 15 15 may order a defendant, as a condition of pretrial release,
 15 16 probation, or bond, to participate in the program. Approved
 15 17 pilot programs shall begin January 15, 2017, or upon the
 15 18 effective date of DPH rules, whichever is earlier, and shall
 15 19 be conducted for a minimum of one year. The DPH is to adopt
 15 20 rules to implement the programs, including but not limited to
 15 21 provisions relating to applications for, approval of, costs of,
 15 22 and oversight of the pilot programs and reporting requirements
 15 23 for participating counties. The DPH is directed to submit
 15 24 a report on the results of the pilot programs and make
 15 25 recommendations to the general assembly by December 15, 2018.

 10  5 of tampering with or circumventing an ignition interlock
 10  6 device.
 10  7    c.  The department of public safety, in consultation with the
 10  8 department, may adopt rules to administer this subsection.
 10  9    2.  a.  An ignition interlock indigent user fund is created
 10 10 in the state treasury. The fund shall be administered by
 10 11 the department and shall consist of moneys collected by the
 10 12 department under this subsection. The moneys in the fund are
 10 13 appropriated to and shall be used by the department to assist
 10 14 indigent users of ignition interlock devices in paying for the
 10 15 use of the devices. Notwithstanding section 8.33, moneys in
 10 16 the fund at the end of each fiscal year shall not revert to any
 10 17 other fund but shall remain in the fund for expenditure for
 10 18 subsequent fiscal years.
 10 19    b.  Each month, the department shall assess an ignition
 10 20 interlock user fee to each user of an ignition interlock
 10 21 device. All ignition interlock user fees shall be collected by
 10 22 the department and deposited in the ignition interlock indigent
 10 23 user fund. The amount of the monthly ignition interlock user
 10 24 fee shall be set by the department so that the moneys in the
 10 25 ignition interlock indigent user fund are sufficient to assist
 10 26 all indigent users of ignition interlock devices in paying for
 10 27 the use of the devices.
 10 28    c.  A person is indigent for the purposes of this subsection
 10 29 if any of the following apply:
 10 30    (1)  The person has an income level at or below one hundred
 10 31 twenty=five percent of the United States poverty level as
 10 32 defined by the most recently revised poverty income guidelines
 10 33 published by the United States department of health and human

 10 35 unable to pay for the cost of an ignition interlock device. In
 11  1 making the determination of a person's ability to pay for the
 11  2 cost of a device, the department shall consider not only the
 11  3 person's income, but also the person's other assets, including
 11  4 but not limited to cash, stocks, bonds, and any other property.
 11  5    (2)  The person has an income level greater than one hundred
 11  6 twenty=five percent, but at or below two hundred percent, of
 11  7 the most recently revised poverty income guidelines published
 11  8 by the United States department of health and human services,
 11  9 and the department determines that paying for the ignition
 11 10 interlock device would cause the person substantial hardship.
 11 11 In determining whether substantial hardship would result, the
 11 12 department shall consider not only the person's income, but
 11 13 also the person's other assets, including but not limited to
 11 14 cash, stocks, bonds, and any other property.
 11 15    d.  The department shall adopt rules to administer this
 11 16 subsection, including but not limited to the manner used to
 11 17 determine the monthly ignition interlock user fee and the

 11 20    Sec. 15.  SOBRIETY MONITORING PILOT PROGRAMS.
 11 21    1.  The department of public health, in collaboration
 11 22 with the department of corrections, the department of public
 11 23 safety, and the department of transportation, may approve an
 11 24 application from a county for a countywide sobriety monitoring
 11 25 pilot program that is available twenty=four hours per day,

 12 23 pursuant to this section may order a defendant, as a condition
 12 24 of pretrial release, probation, or bond, to participate in the
 12 25 program.
 12 26    4.  An approved pilot program shall begin on January 15,
 12 27 2017, or upon the effective date of department rules, whichever
 12 28 is earlier, and shall be conducted for a minimum of one year.
 12 29    5.  The department of public health shall adopt rules
 12 30 pursuant to chapter 17A to implement this section including
 12 31 but not limited to provisions relating to applications for,
 12 32 approval of, costs of, and oversight of the pilot programs and
 12 33 reporting requirements for participating counties.
 12 34    6.  The department of public health shall submit a report on
 12 35 the results of the pilot programs and make recommendations to
 13  1 the general assembly by December 15, 2018.
 13  2    7.  For the purposes of this section, "chemical substance"
 13  3 means alcohol, wine, spirits, and beer as defined in section
 13  4 123.3 and controlled substances as defined in section 124.101.
 13  5                           EXPLANATION
 13  6 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
 13  7 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
 13  8    Current law requires a person guilty of operating while
 13  9 intoxicated (OWI) to install an ignition interlock device in
 13 10 the person's vehicle if the person seeks a temporary restricted
 13 11 license, unless the person's alcohol concentration was less
 13 12 than .10 and no accident occurred. This bill strikes that
 13 13 exception, and also requires a person guilty of OWI to install
 13 14 an ignition interlock device in the person's vehicle upon the
 13 15 revocation of the person's driver's license rather than upon
 13 16 the person's application for a temporary restricted license.
 13 17    Under current law, an ignition interlock device is required
 13 18 to be installed in a person's vehicle for the period of time
 13 19 for which the person's temporary restricted license is issued,
 13 20 and up to one additional year after license reinstatement if
 13 21 the person has two or more OWI revocations. The bill requires
 13 22 the permanent installation of an ignition interlock device with
 13 23 two exceptions. If the ignition interlock device was installed
 13 24 as a result of the person's first OWI offense or revocation and
 13 25 a test was obtained, the device shall be uninstalled 180 days
 13 26 after the person's license was revoked, the person last failed
 13 27 a test by the ignition interlock device, or the defendant last
 13 28 failed to maintain the device as required, whichever is latest.
 13 29 If the ignition interlock device was installed as a result of
 13 30 the person's first OWI offense or revocation and a test was
 13 31 refused, the device shall be uninstalled 180 days after the
 13 32 person's license revocation period is over, the person last
 13 33 failed a test by the ignition interlock device, or the person
 13 34 last failed to maintain the device as required, whichever is
 13 35 latest.
 14  1 The bill provides an ignition interlock device shall not
 14  2 be uninstalled if the person has been convicted of a second
 14  3 or subsequent OWI violation, if the person's license has been
 14  4 revoked for a second or subsequent time, or if the person has
 14  5 been convicted of tampering with or circumventing an ignition
 14  6 interlock device.
 14  7    The bill requires the department of transportation (DOT)
 14  8 to assess a monthly ignition interlock user fee to each user
 14  9 of an ignition interlock device. All ignition interlock user
 14 10 fees will be collected by the DOT and deposited in an ignition
 14 11 interlock indigent user fund (IIIUF). The bill requires the
 14 12 DOT to use the moneys in the IIIUF to assist indigent users
 14 13 of ignition interlock devices in paying for the use of the
 14 14 devices. The amount of the monthly ignition interlock user fee
 14 15 shall be set by the DOT so that the moneys in the IIIUF are
 14 16 sufficient to assist all indigent users of ignition interlock
 14 17 devices in paying for the use of the devices.
 14 18    Under the bill, a person is indigent if the person has an
 14 19 income level at or below 125 percent of the U.S. poverty level
 14 20 and the person is unable to pay for the cost of an ignition
 14 21 interlock device. A person is also indigent if the person has
 14 22 an income level greater than 125 percent, but at or below 200
 14 23 percent, of the U.S. poverty level and paying for the ignition
 14 24 interlock device would cause the person substantial hardship.
 14 25    The bill provides for county sobriety monitoring pilot
 14 26 programs. The bill allows the department of public health
 14 27 (DPH), in collaboration with the department of corrections,
 14 28 the department of public safety, and the DOT, to approve
 14 29 applications from counties for countywide sobriety monitoring
 14 30 pilot programs. The programs are to be available 24 hours per
 14 31 day, seven days per week, in an effort to reduce the number
 14 32 of crimes related to OWI.  One application shall be approved
 14 33 for a county with a population of 200,000 people or more, one
 14 34 application shall be approved for a county with a population of
 14 35 100,000 people or more but less than 200,000 people, and one
 15  1 application shall be approved for a county with a population of
 15  2 less than 100,000 people.
 15  3    The programs shall require individuals charged with or
 15  4 convicted of OWI to abstain from all chemical substances for
 15  5 a period of time. The programs are to require testing to
 15  6 determine whether a chemical substance is present at least
 15  7 twice per day at a central location where an immediate sanction
 15  8 can be applied or, where such testing is impractical, by
 15  9 continuous transdermal or electronic monitoring. The programs
 15 10 shall also apply sanctions when test results definitively
 15 11 indicate the presence of a chemical substance. The programs
 15 12 shall require participants to pay program costs and to install
 15 13 an ignition interlock device.
 15 14    A court in a county that has established a pilot program
 15 15 may order a defendant, as a condition of pretrial release,
 15 16 probation, or bond, to participate in the program. Approved
 15 17 pilot programs shall begin January 15, 2017, or upon the
 15 18 effective date of DPH rules, whichever is earlier, and shall
 15 19 be conducted for a minimum of one year. The DPH is to adopt
 15 20 rules to implement the programs, including but not limited to
 15 21 provisions relating to applications for, approval of, costs of,
 15 22 and oversight of the pilot programs and reporting requirements
 15 23 for participating counties. The DPH is directed to submit
 15 24 a report on the results of the pilot programs and make
 15 25 recommendations to the general assembly by December 15, 2018.

 10  8 department, may adopt rules to administer this subsection.
 10  9    2.  a.  An ignition interlock indigent user fund is created
 10 10 in the state treasury. The fund shall be administered by
 10 11 the department and shall consist of moneys collected by the
 10 12 department under this subsection. The moneys in the fund are
 10 13 appropriated to and shall be used by the department to assist
 10 14 indigent users of ignition interlock devices in paying for the
 10 15 use of the devices. Notwithstanding section 8.33, moneys in
 10 16 the fund at the end of each fiscal year shall not revert to any

 10 21 device. All ignition interlock user fees shall be collected by
 10 22 the department and deposited in the ignition interlock indigent
 10 23 user fund. The amount of the monthly ignition interlock user
 10 24 fee shall be set by the department so that the moneys in the
 10 25 ignition interlock indigent user fund are sufficient to assist
 10 26 all indigent users of ignition interlock devices in paying for
 10 27 the use of the devices.
 10 28    c.  A person is indigent for the purposes of this subsection
 10 29 if any of the following apply:
 10 30    (1)  The person has an income level at or below one hundred
 10 31 twenty=five percent of the United States poverty level as
 10 32 defined by the most recently revised poverty income guidelines
 10 33 published by the United States department of health and human
 10 34 services, and the department determines that the person is
 10 35 unable to pay for the cost of an ignition interlock device. In
 11  1 making the determination of a person's ability to pay for the
 11  2 cost of a device, the department shall consider not only the
 11  3 person's income, but also the person's other assets, including
 11  4 but not limited to cash, stocks, bonds, and any other property.
 11  5    (2)  The person has an income level greater than one hundred
 11  6 twenty=five percent, but at or below two hundred percent, of
 11  7 the most recently revised poverty income guidelines published
 11  8 by the United States department of health and human services,
 11  9 and the department determines that paying for the ignition
 11 10 interlock device would cause the person substantial hardship.
 11 11 In determining whether substantial hardship would result, the
 11 12 department shall consider not only the person's income, but
 11 13 also the person's other assets, including but not limited to
 11 14 cash, stocks, bonds, and any other property.
 11 15    d.  The department shall adopt rules to administer this
 11 16 subsection, including but not limited to the manner used to
 11 17 determine the monthly ignition interlock user fee and the
 11 18 accepted form and manner in which a person may demonstrate
 11 19 indigency.
 11 20    Sec. 15.  SOBRIETY MONITORING PILOT PROGRAMS.
 11 21    1.  The department of public health, in collaboration
 11 22 with the department of corrections, the department of public
 11 23 safety, and the department of transportation, may approve an
 11 24 application from a county for a countywide sobriety monitoring
 11 25 pilot program that is available twenty=four hours per day,
 11 26 seven days per week, in an effort to reduce the number of
 11 27 crimes related to operating while intoxicated. One application
 11 28 shall be approved for a county with a population of two hundred
 11 29 thousand people or more, one application shall be approved
 11 30 for a county with a population of one hundred thousand people
 11 31 or more but less than two hundred thousand people, and one
 11 32 application shall be approved for a county with a population of
 11 33 less than one hundred thousand people.
 11 34    2.  A sobriety monitoring pilot program shall do all of the
 11 35 following:
 12  1    a.  Require a person who has been charged with, pled guilty

 12  4    b.  Require the person to be subject to testing to determine
 12  5 whether a chemical substance is present in the person's body
 12  6 in the following manner:
 12  7    (1)  At least twice per day at a central location where an
 12  8 immediate sanction can be applied.
 12  9    (2)  Where testing under subparagraph (1) is impractical, by
 12 10 continuous transdermal or electronic monitoring.
 12 11    c.  Apply sanctions when test results definitively, and
 12 12 without presumption, indicate the presence of chemical
 12 13 substances.
 12 14    d.  Require a person participating in the program to pay
 12 15 program costs, including costs of installation, monitoring, and
 12 16 deactivation of any testing devices.
 12 17    e.  Require the person to install an ignition interlock
 12 18 device of a type approved by the commissioner of public safety
 12 19 on all vehicles owned or operated by the person, and require
 12 20 the person to pay the costs associated with the installation
 12 21 and use of the ignition interlock device.
 12 22    3.  A court in a county that has established a pilot program
 12 23 pursuant to this section may order a defendant, as a condition
 12 24 of pretrial release, probation, or bond, to participate in the
 12 25 program.
 12 26    4.  An approved pilot program shall begin on January 15,

 13  2    7.  For the purposes of this section, "chemical substance"
 13  3 means alcohol, wine, spirits, and beer as defined in section
 13  4 123.3 and controlled substances as defined in section 124.101.
 13  5                           EXPLANATION
 13  6 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
 13  7 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
 13  8    Current law requires a person guilty of operating while
 13  9 intoxicated (OWI) to install an ignition interlock device in
 13 10 the person's vehicle if the person seeks a temporary restricted
 13 11 license, unless the person's alcohol concentration was less
 13 12 than .10 and no accident occurred. This bill strikes that
 13 13 exception, and also requires a person guilty of OWI to install
 13 14 an ignition interlock device in the person's vehicle upon the
 13 15 revocation of the person's driver's license rather than upon
 13 16 the person's application for a temporary restricted license.
 13 17    Under current law, an ignition interlock device is required
 13 18 to be installed in a person's vehicle for the period of time
 13 19 for which the person's temporary restricted license is issued,
 13 20 and up to one additional year after license reinstatement if
 13 21 the person has two or more OWI revocations. The bill requires
 13 22 the permanent installation of an ignition interlock device with
 13 23 two exceptions. If the ignition interlock device was installed
 13 24 as a result of the person's first OWI offense or revocation and
 13 25 a test was obtained, the device shall be uninstalled 180 days
 13 26 after the person's license was revoked, the person last failed
 13 27 a test by the ignition interlock device, or the defendant last
 13 28 failed to maintain the device as required, whichever is latest.
 13 29 If the ignition interlock device was installed as a result of
 13 30 the person's first OWI offense or revocation and a test was
 13 31 refused, the device shall be uninstalled 180 days after the
 13 32 person's license revocation period is over, the person last
 13 33 failed a test by the ignition interlock device, or the person
 13 34 last failed to maintain the device as required, whichever is
 13 35 latest.
 14  1 The bill provides an ignition interlock device shall not
 14  2 be uninstalled if the person has been convicted of a second
 14  3 or subsequent OWI violation, if the person's license has been
 14  4 revoked for a second or subsequent time, or if the person has
 14  5 been convicted of tampering with or circumventing an ignition
 14  6 interlock device.
 14  7    The bill requires the department of transportation (DOT)
 14  8 to assess a monthly ignition interlock user fee to each user
 14  9 of an ignition interlock device. All ignition interlock user
 14 10 fees will be collected by the DOT and deposited in an ignition
 14 11 interlock indigent user fund (IIIUF). The bill requires the
 14 12 DOT to use the moneys in the IIIUF to assist indigent users
 14 13 of ignition interlock devices in paying for the use of the
 14 14 devices. The amount of the monthly ignition interlock user fee
 14 15 shall be set by the DOT so that the moneys in the IIIUF are
 14 16 sufficient to assist all indigent users of ignition interlock
 14 17 devices in paying for the use of the devices.
 14 18    Under the bill, a person is indigent if the person has an
 14 19 income level at or below 125 percent of the U.S. poverty level
 14 20 and the person is unable to pay for the cost of an ignition
 14 21 interlock device. A person is also indigent if the person has
 14 22 an income level greater than 125 percent, but at or below 200
 14 23 percent, of the U.S. poverty level and paying for the ignition
 14 24 interlock device would cause the person substantial hardship.
 14 25    The bill provides for county sobriety monitoring pilot
 14 26 programs. The bill allows the department of public health
 14 27 (DPH), in collaboration with the department of corrections,
 14 28 the department of public safety, and the DOT, to approve
 14 29 applications from counties for countywide sobriety monitoring
 14 30 pilot programs. The programs are to be available 24 hours per
 14 31 day, seven days per week, in an effort to reduce the number
 14 32 of crimes related to OWI.  One application shall be approved
 14 33 for a county with a population of 200,000 people or more, one
 14 34 application shall be approved for a county with a population of
 14 35 100,000 people or more but less than 200,000 people, and one
 15  1 application shall be approved for a county with a population of
 15  2 less than 100,000 people.
 15  3    The programs shall require individuals charged with or
 15  4 convicted of OWI to abstain from all chemical substances for
 15  5 a period of time. The programs are to require testing to
 15  6 determine whether a chemical substance is present at least
 15  7 twice per day at a central location where an immediate sanction
 15  8 can be applied or, where such testing is impractical, by
 15  9 continuous transdermal or electronic monitoring. The programs
 15 10 shall also apply sanctions when test results definitively
 15 11 indicate the presence of a chemical substance. The programs
 15 12 shall require participants to pay program costs and to install
 15 13 an ignition interlock device.
 15 14    A court in a county that has established a pilot program
 15 15 may order a defendant, as a condition of pretrial release,
 15 16 probation, or bond, to participate in the program. Approved
 15 17 pilot programs shall begin January 15, 2017, or upon the
 15 18 effective date of DPH rules, whichever is earlier, and shall
 15 19 be conducted for a minimum of one year. The DPH is to adopt
 15 20 rules to implement the programs, including but not limited to
 15 21 provisions relating to applications for, approval of, costs of,
 15 22 and oversight of the pilot programs and reporting requirements
 15 23 for participating counties. The DPH is directed to submit
 15 24 a report on the results of the pilot programs and make
 15 25 recommendations to the general assembly by December 15, 2018.

 11 23 safety, and the department of transportation, may approve an
 11 24 application from a county for a countywide sobriety monitoring
 11 25 pilot program that is available twenty=four hours per day,
 11 26 seven days per week, in an effort to reduce the number of
 11 27 crimes related to operating while intoxicated. One application
 11 28 shall be approved for a county with a population of two hundred
 11 29 thousand people or more, one application shall be approved

 12  6 in the following manner:
 12  7    (1)  At least twice per day at a central location where an
 12  8 immediate sanction can be applied.
 12  9    (2)  Where testing under subparagraph (1) is impractical, by
 12 10 continuous transdermal or electronic monitoring.
 12 11    c.  Apply sanctions when test results definitively, and
 12 12 without presumption, indicate the presence of chemical
 12 13 substances.
 12 14    d.  Require a person participating in the program to pay
 12 15 program costs, including costs of installation, monitoring, and
 12 16 deactivation of any testing devices.
 12 17    e.  Require the person to install an ignition interlock
 12 18 device of a type approved by the commissioner of public safety
 12 19 on all vehicles owned or operated by the person, and require
 12 20 the person to pay the costs associated with the installation
 12 21 and use of the ignition interlock device.
 12 22    3.  A court in a county that has established a pilot program
 12 23 pursuant to this section may order a defendant, as a condition
 12 24 of pretrial release, probation, or bond, to participate in the
 12 25 program.
 12 26    4.  An approved pilot program shall begin on January 15,
 12 27 2017, or upon the effective date of department rules, whichever
 12 28 is earlier, and shall be conducted for a minimum of one year.
 12 29    5.  The department of public health shall adopt rules
 12 30 pursuant to chapter 17A to implement this section including
 12 31 but not limited to provisions relating to applications for,
 12 32 approval of, costs of, and oversight of the pilot programs and
 12 33 reporting requirements for participating counties.
 12 34    6.  The department of public health shall submit a report on
 12 35 the results of the pilot programs and make recommendations to
 13  1 the general assembly by December 15, 2018.
 13  2    7.  For the purposes of this section, "chemical substance"
 13  3 means alcohol, wine, spirits, and beer as defined in section
 13  4 123.3 and controlled substances as defined in section 124.101.
 13  5                           EXPLANATION
 13  6 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
 13  7 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
 13  8    Current law requires a person guilty of operating while
 13  9 intoxicated (OWI) to install an ignition interlock device in
 13 10 the person's vehicle if the person seeks a temporary restricted
 13 11 license, unless the person's alcohol concentration was less
 13 12 than .10 and no accident occurred. This bill strikes that
 13 13 exception, and also requires a person guilty of OWI to install
 13 14 an ignition interlock device in the person's vehicle upon the
 13 15 revocation of the person's driver's license rather than upon
 13 16 the person's application for a temporary restricted license.
 13 17    Under current law, an ignition interlock device is required
 13 18 to be installed in a person's vehicle for the period of time
 13 19 for which the person's temporary restricted license is issued,
 13 20 and up to one additional year after license reinstatement if
 13 21 the person has two or more OWI revocations. The bill requires
 13 22 the permanent installation of an ignition interlock device with
 13 23 two exceptions. If the ignition interlock device was installed
 13 24 as a result of the person's first OWI offense or revocation and
 13 25 a test was obtained, the device shall be uninstalled 180 days
 13 26 after the person's license was revoked, the person last failed
 13 27 a test by the ignition interlock device, or the defendant last
 13 28 failed to maintain the device as required, whichever is latest.
 13 29 If the ignition interlock device was installed as a result of
 13 30 the person's first OWI offense or revocation and a test was
 13 31 refused, the device shall be uninstalled 180 days after the
 13 32 person's license revocation period is over, the person last
 13 33 failed a test by the ignition interlock device, or the person
 13 34 last failed to maintain the device as required, whichever is
 13 35 latest.
 14  1 The bill provides an ignition interlock device shall not
 14  2 be uninstalled if the person has been convicted of a second
 14  3 or subsequent OWI violation, if the person's license has been
 14  4 revoked for a second or subsequent time, or if the person has
 14  5 been convicted of tampering with or circumventing an ignition
 14  6 interlock device.
 14  7    The bill requires the department of transportation (DOT)
 14  8 to assess a monthly ignition interlock user fee to each user
 14  9 of an ignition interlock device. All ignition interlock user
 14 10 fees will be collected by the DOT and deposited in an ignition
 14 11 interlock indigent user fund (IIIUF). The bill requires the
 14 12 DOT to use the moneys in the IIIUF to assist indigent users
 14 13 of ignition interlock devices in paying for the use of the
 14 14 devices. The amount of the monthly ignition interlock user fee
 14 15 shall be set by the DOT so that the moneys in the IIIUF are
 14 16 sufficient to assist all indigent users of ignition interlock
 14 17 devices in paying for the use of the devices.
 14 18    Under the bill, a person is indigent if the person has an
 14 19 income level at or below 125 percent of the U.S. poverty level
 14 20 and the person is unable to pay for the cost of an ignition
 14 21 interlock device. A person is also indigent if the person has
 14 22 an income level greater than 125 percent, but at or below 200
 14 23 percent, of the U.S. poverty level and paying for the ignition
 14 24 interlock device would cause the person substantial hardship.
 14 25    The bill provides for county sobriety monitoring pilot
 14 26 programs. The bill allows the department of public health
 14 27 (DPH), in collaboration with the department of corrections,
 14 28 the department of public safety, and the DOT, to approve
 14 29 applications from counties for countywide sobriety monitoring
 14 30 pilot programs. The programs are to be available 24 hours per
 14 31 day, seven days per week, in an effort to reduce the number
 14 32 of crimes related to OWI.  One application shall be approved
 14 33 for a county with a population of 200,000 people or more, one
 14 34 application shall be approved for a county with a population of
 14 35 100,000 people or more but less than 200,000 people, and one
 15  1 application shall be approved for a county with a population of
 15  2 less than 100,000 people.
 15  3    The programs shall require individuals charged with or
 15  4 convicted of OWI to abstain from all chemical substances for
 15  5 a period of time. The programs are to require testing to
 15  6 determine whether a chemical substance is present at least
 15  7 twice per day at a central location where an immediate sanction
 15  8 can be applied or, where such testing is impractical, by
 15  9 continuous transdermal or electronic monitoring. The programs
 15 10 shall also apply sanctions when test results definitively
 15 11 indicate the presence of a chemical substance. The programs
 15 12 shall require participants to pay program costs and to install
 15 13 an ignition interlock device.
 15 14    A court in a county that has established a pilot program
 15 15 may order a defendant, as a condition of pretrial release,
 15 16 probation, or bond, to participate in the program. Approved
 15 17 pilot programs shall begin January 15, 2017, or upon the
 15 18 effective date of DPH rules, whichever is earlier, and shall
 15 19 be conducted for a minimum of one year. The DPH is to adopt
 15 20 rules to implement the programs, including but not limited to
 15 21 provisions relating to applications for, approval of, costs of,
 15 22 and oversight of the pilot programs and reporting requirements
 15 23 for participating counties. The DPH is directed to submit
 15 24 a report on the results of the pilot programs and make
 15 25 recommendations to the general assembly by December 15, 2018.

  9 23    (2)  If the ignition interlock device was installed as a
  9 24 result of the defendant's first offense or revocation under
  9 25 this chapter and a test was refused, the device shall be
  9 26 uninstalled one hundred eighty days after the later of the
  9 27 following:
  9 28    (a)  The date the defendant's license revocation period
  9 29 ends.
  9 30    (b)  The date the defendant last failed a test or retest
  9 31 by the device because the defendant's alcohol concentration
  9 32 exceeded the limit established under 661 IAC 158.6.
  9 33    (c)  The date the defendant last failed to maintain the
  9 34 device as required by 661 IAC ch. 158.

 10  2 a second or subsequent violation of section 321J.2, if the
 10  3 defendant's license has been revoked for a second or subsequent
 10  4 time under this chapter, or if the defendant has been convicted
 10  5 of tampering with or circumventing an ignition interlock
 10  6 device.
 10  7    c.  The department of public safety, in consultation with the
 10  8 department, may adopt rules to administer this subsection.
 10  9    2.  a.  An ignition interlock indigent user fund is created
 10 10 in the state treasury. The fund shall be administered by
 10 11 the department and shall consist of moneys collected by the
 10 12 department under this subsection. The moneys in the fund are
 10 13 appropriated to and shall be used by the department to assist
 10 14 indigent users of ignition interlock devices in paying for the
 10 15 use of the devices. Notwithstanding section 8.33, moneys in
 10 16 the fund at the end of each fiscal year shall not revert to any
 10 17 other fund but shall remain in the fund for expenditure for
 10 18 subsequent fiscal years.
 10 19    b.  Each month, the department shall assess an ignition
 10 20 interlock user fee to each user of an ignition interlock
 10 21 device. All ignition interlock user fees shall be collected by
 10 22 the department and deposited in the ignition interlock indigent
 10 23 user fund. The amount of the monthly ignition interlock user
 10 24 fee shall be set by the department so that the moneys in the
 10 25 ignition interlock indigent user fund are sufficient to assist
 10 26 all indigent users of ignition interlock devices in paying for
 10 27 the use of the devices.
 10 28    c.  A person is indigent for the purposes of this subsection
 10 29 if any of the following apply:
 10 30    (1)  The person has an income level at or below one hundred
 10 31 twenty=five percent of the United States poverty level as
 10 32 defined by the most recently revised poverty income guidelines
 10 33 published by the United States department of health and human
 10 34 services, and the department determines that the person is
 10 35 unable to pay for the cost of an ignition interlock device. In
 11  1 making the determination of a person's ability to pay for the
 11  2 cost of a device, the department shall consider not only the
 11  3 person's income, but also the person's other assets, including
 11  4 but not limited to cash, stocks, bonds, and any other property.
 11  5    (2)  The person has an income level greater than one hundred
 11  6 twenty=five percent, but at or below two hundred percent, of
 11  7 the most recently revised poverty income guidelines published
 11  8 by the United States department of health and human services,
 11  9 and the department determines that paying for the ignition
 11 10 interlock device would cause the person substantial hardship.
 11 11 In determining whether substantial hardship would result, the
 11 12 department shall consider not only the person's income, but
 11 13 also the person's other assets, including but not limited to
 11 14 cash, stocks, bonds, and any other property.
 11 15    d.  The department shall adopt rules to administer this
 11 16 subsection, including but not limited to the manner used to
 11 17 determine the monthly ignition interlock user fee and the
 11 18 accepted form and manner in which a person may demonstrate
 11 19 indigency.
 11 20    Sec. 15.  SOBRIETY MONITORING PILOT PROGRAMS.
 11 21    1.  The department of public health, in collaboration

 10 35 unable to pay for the cost of an ignition interlock device. In
 11  1 making the determination of a person's ability to pay for the
 11  2 cost of a device, the department shall consider not only the
 11  3 person's income, but also the person's other assets, including
 11  4 but not limited to cash, stocks, bonds, and any other property.
 11  5    (2)  The person has an income level greater than one hundred
 11  6 twenty=five percent, but at or below two hundred percent, of
 11  7 the most recently revised poverty income guidelines published
 11  8 by the United States department of health and human services,
 11  9 and the department determines that paying for the ignition
 11 10 interlock device would cause the person substantial hardship.
 11 11 In determining whether substantial hardship would result, the
 11 12 department shall consider not only the person's income, but
 11 13 also the person's other assets, including but not limited to
 11 14 cash, stocks, bonds, and any other property.
 11 15    d.  The department shall adopt rules to administer this
 11 16 subsection, including but not limited to the manner used to

 11 19 indigency.
 11 20    Sec. 15.  SOBRIETY MONITORING PILOT PROGRAMS.
 11 21    1.  The department of public health, in collaboration
 11 22 with the department of corrections, the department of public
 11 23 safety, and the department of transportation, may approve an
 11 24 application from a county for a countywide sobriety monitoring
 11 25 pilot program that is available twenty=four hours per day,
 11 26 seven days per week, in an effort to reduce the number of
 11 27 crimes related to operating while intoxicated. One application
 11 28 shall be approved for a county with a population of two hundred
 11 29 thousand people or more, one application shall be approved
 11 30 for a county with a population of one hundred thousand people
 11 31 or more but less than two hundred thousand people, and one
 11 32 application shall be approved for a county with a population of
 11 33 less than one hundred thousand people.
 11 34    2.  A sobriety monitoring pilot program shall do all of the
 11 35 following:
 12  1    a.  Require a person who has been charged with, pled guilty
 12  2 to, or been convicted of a violation of section 321J.2 to
 12  3 abstain from all chemical substances for a period of time.
 12  4    b.  Require the person to be subject to testing to determine
 12  5 whether a chemical substance is present in the person's body
 12  6 in the following manner:
 12  7    (1)  At least twice per day at a central location where an
 12  8 immediate sanction can be applied.
 12  9    (2)  Where testing under subparagraph (1) is impractical, by
 12 10 continuous transdermal or electronic monitoring.
 12 11    c.  Apply sanctions when test results definitively, and
 12 12 without presumption, indicate the presence of chemical
 12 13 substances.
 12 14    d.  Require a person participating in the program to pay
 12 15 program costs, including costs of installation, monitoring, and
 12 16 deactivation of any testing devices.
 12 17    e.  Require the person to install an ignition interlock
 12 18 device of a type approved by the commissioner of public safety
 12 19 on all vehicles owned or operated by the person, and require
 12 20 the person to pay the costs associated with the installation
 12 21 and use of the ignition interlock device.
 12 22    3.  A court in a county that has established a pilot program
 12 23 pursuant to this section may order a defendant, as a condition
 12 24 of pretrial release, probation, or bond, to participate in the
 12 25 program.
 12 26    4.  An approved pilot program shall begin on January 15,
 12 27 2017, or upon the effective date of department rules, whichever
 12 28 is earlier, and shall be conducted for a minimum of one year.
 12 29    5.  The department of public health shall adopt rules
 12 30 pursuant to chapter 17A to implement this section including
 12 31 but not limited to provisions relating to applications for,
 12 32 approval of, costs of, and oversight of the pilot programs and
 12 33 reporting requirements for participating counties.
 12 34    6.  The department of public health shall submit a report on
 12 35 the results of the pilot programs and make recommendations to
 13  1 the general assembly by December 15, 2018.
 13  2    7.  For the purposes of this section, "chemical substance"
 13  3 means alcohol, wine, spirits, and beer as defined in section
 13  4 123.3 and controlled substances as defined in section 124.101.
 13  5                           EXPLANATION
 13  6 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
 13  7 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
 13  8    Current law requires a person guilty of operating while
 13  9 intoxicated (OWI) to install an ignition interlock device in
 13 10 the person's vehicle if the person seeks a temporary restricted
 13 11 license, unless the person's alcohol concentration was less
 13 12 than .10 and no accident occurred. This bill strikes that
 13 13 exception, and also requires a person guilty of OWI to install
 13 14 an ignition interlock device in the person's vehicle upon the
 13 15 revocation of the person's driver's license rather than upon
 13 16 the person's application for a temporary restricted license.
 13 17    Under current law, an ignition interlock device is required
 13 18 to be installed in a person's vehicle for the period of time
 13 19 for which the person's temporary restricted license is issued,
 13 20 and up to one additional year after license reinstatement if
 13 21 the person has two or more OWI revocations. The bill requires
 13 22 the permanent installation of an ignition interlock device with
 13 23 two exceptions. If the ignition interlock device was installed
 13 24 as a result of the person's first OWI offense or revocation and
 13 25 a test was obtained, the device shall be uninstalled 180 days
 13 26 after the person's license was revoked, the person last failed
 13 27 a test by the ignition interlock device, or the defendant last
 13 28 failed to maintain the device as required, whichever is latest.
 13 29 If the ignition interlock device was installed as a result of
 13 30 the person's first OWI offense or revocation and a test was
 13 31 refused, the device shall be uninstalled 180 days after the
 13 32 person's license revocation period is over, the person last
 13 33 failed a test by the ignition interlock device, or the person
 13 34 last failed to maintain the device as required, whichever is
 13 35 latest.
 14  1 The bill provides an ignition interlock device shall not
 14  2 be uninstalled if the person has been convicted of a second
 14  3 or subsequent OWI violation, if the person's license has been
 14  4 revoked for a second or subsequent time, or if the person has
 14  5 been convicted of tampering with or circumventing an ignition
 14  6 interlock device.
 14  7    The bill requires the department of transportation (DOT)
 14  8 to assess a monthly ignition interlock user fee to each user
 14  9 of an ignition interlock device. All ignition interlock user
 14 10 fees will be collected by the DOT and deposited in an ignition
 14 11 interlock indigent user fund (IIIUF). The bill requires the
 14 12 DOT to use the moneys in the IIIUF to assist indigent users
 14 13 of ignition interlock devices in paying for the use of the
 14 14 devices. The amount of the monthly ignition interlock user fee
 14 15 shall be set by the DOT so that the moneys in the IIIUF are
 14 16 sufficient to assist all indigent users of ignition interlock
 14 17 devices in paying for the use of the devices.
 14 18    Under the bill, a person is indigent if the person has an
 14 19 income level at or below 125 percent of the U.S. poverty level
 14 20 and the person is unable to pay for the cost of an ignition
 14 21 interlock device. A person is also indigent if the person has
 14 22 an income level greater than 125 percent, but at or below 200
 14 23 percent, of the U.S. poverty level and paying for the ignition
 14 24 interlock device would cause the person substantial hardship.
 14 25    The bill provides for county sobriety monitoring pilot
 14 26 programs. The bill allows the department of public health
 14 27 (DPH), in collaboration with the department of corrections,
 14 28 the department of public safety, and the DOT, to approve
 14 29 applications from counties for countywide sobriety monitoring
 14 30 pilot programs. The programs are to be available 24 hours per
 14 31 day, seven days per week, in an effort to reduce the number
 14 32 of crimes related to OWI.  One application shall be approved
 14 33 for a county with a population of 200,000 people or more, one
 14 34 application shall be approved for a county with a population of
 14 35 100,000 people or more but less than 200,000 people, and one
 15  1 application shall be approved for a county with a population of
 15  2 less than 100,000 people.
 15  3    The programs shall require individuals charged with or
 15  4 convicted of OWI to abstain from all chemical substances for
 15  5 a period of time. The programs are to require testing to
 15  6 determine whether a chemical substance is present at least
 15  7 twice per day at a central location where an immediate sanction
 15  8 can be applied or, where such testing is impractical, by
 15  9 continuous transdermal or electronic monitoring. The programs
 15 10 shall also apply sanctions when test results definitively
 15 11 indicate the presence of a chemical substance. The programs
 15 12 shall require participants to pay program costs and to install
 15 13 an ignition interlock device.
 15 14    A court in a county that has established a pilot program
 15 15 may order a defendant, as a condition of pretrial release,
 15 16 probation, or bond, to participate in the program. Approved
 15 17 pilot programs shall begin January 15, 2017, or upon the
 15 18 effective date of DPH rules, whichever is earlier, and shall
 15 19 be conducted for a minimum of one year. The DPH is to adopt
 15 20 rules to implement the programs, including but not limited to
 15 21 provisions relating to applications for, approval of, costs of,
 15 22 and oversight of the pilot programs and reporting requirements
 15 23 for participating counties. The DPH is directed to submit
 15 24 a report on the results of the pilot programs and make
 15 25 recommendations to the general assembly by December 15, 2018.

  9 24 result of the defendant's first offense or revocation under
  9 25 this chapter and a test was refused, the device shall be
  9 26 uninstalled one hundred eighty days after the later of the
  9 27 following:
  9 28    (a)  The date the defendant's license revocation period
  9 29 ends.
  9 30    (b)  The date the defendant last failed a test or retest
  9 31 by the device because the defendant's alcohol concentration
  9 32 exceeded the limit established under 661 IAC 158.6.
  9 33    (c)  The date the defendant last failed to maintain the
  9 34 device as required by 661 IAC ch. 158.
  9 35    b.  An ignition interlock device shall not be uninstalled
 10  1 under this section if the defendant has been convicted of
 10  2 a second or subsequent violation of section 321J.2, if the
 10  3 defendant's license has been revoked for a second or subsequent
 10  4 time under this chapter, or if the defendant has been convicted
 10  5 of tampering with or circumventing an ignition interlock
 10  6 device.
 10  7    c.  The department of public safety, in consultation with the
 10  8 department, may adopt rules to administer this subsection.
 10  9    2.  a.  An ignition interlock indigent user fund is created
 10 10 in the state treasury. The fund shall be administered by
 10 11 the department and shall consist of moneys collected by the
 10 12 department under this subsection. The moneys in the fund are
 10 13 appropriated to and shall be used by the department to assist
 10 14 indigent users of ignition interlock devices in paying for the
 10 15 use of the devices. Notwithstanding section 8.33, moneys in
 10 16 the fund at the end of each fiscal year shall not revert to any
 10 17 other fund but shall remain in the fund for expenditure for
 10 18 subsequent fiscal years.
 10 19    b.  Each month, the department shall assess an ignition
 10 20 interlock user fee to each user of an ignition interlock
 10 21 device. All ignition interlock user fees shall be collected by
 10 22 the department and deposited in the ignition interlock indigent
 10 23 user fund. The amount of the monthly ignition interlock user
 10 24 fee shall be set by the department so that the moneys in the
 10 25 ignition interlock indigent user fund are sufficient to assist
 10 26 all indigent users of ignition interlock devices in paying for
 10 27 the use of the devices.
 10 28    c.  A person is indigent for the purposes of this subsection
 10 29 if any of the following apply:
 10 30    (1)  The person has an income level at or below one hundred
 10 31 twenty=five percent of the United States poverty level as
 10 32 defined by the most recently revised poverty income guidelines
 10 33 published by the United States department of health and human
 10 34 services, and the department determines that the person is
 10 35 unable to pay for the cost of an ignition interlock device. In
 11  1 making the determination of a person's ability to pay for the
 11  2 cost of a device, the department shall consider not only the
 11  3 person's income, but also the person's other assets, including
 11  4 but not limited to cash, stocks, bonds, and any other property.
 11  5    (2)  The person has an income level greater than one hundred
 11  6 twenty=five percent, but at or below two hundred percent, of
 11  7 the most recently revised poverty income guidelines published
 11  8 by the United States department of health and human services,
 11  9 and the department determines that paying for the ignition
 11 10 interlock device would cause the person substantial hardship.
 11 11 In determining whether substantial hardship would result, the
 11 12 department shall consider not only the person's income, but
 11 13 also the person's other assets, including but not limited to
 11 14 cash, stocks, bonds, and any other property.
 11 15    d.  The department shall adopt rules to administer this
 11 16 subsection, including but not limited to the manner used to
 11 17 determine the monthly ignition interlock user fee and the
 11 18 accepted form and manner in which a person may demonstrate
 11 19 indigency.

 10 14 indigent users of ignition interlock devices in paying for the
 10 15 use of the devices. Notwithstanding section 8.33, moneys in
 10 16 the fund at the end of each fiscal year shall not revert to any
 10 17 other fund but shall remain in the fund for expenditure for
 10 18 subsequent fiscal years.
 10 19    b.  Each month, the department shall assess an ignition
 10 20 interlock user fee to each user of an ignition interlock
 10 21 device. All ignition interlock user fees shall be collected by
 10 22 the department and deposited in the ignition interlock indigent
 10 23 user fund. The amount of the monthly ignition interlock user
 10 24 fee shall be set by the department so that the moneys in the
 10 25 ignition interlock indigent user fund are sufficient to assist
 10 26 all indigent users of ignition interlock devices in paying for
 10 27 the use of the devices.
 10 28    c.  A person is indigent for the purposes of this subsection
 10 29 if any of the following apply:
 10 30    (1)  The person has an income level at or below one hundred
 10 31 twenty=five percent of the United States poverty level as
 10 32 defined by the most recently revised poverty income guidelines
 10 33 published by the United States department of health and human
 10 34 services, and the department determines that the person is
 10 35 unable to pay for the cost of an ignition interlock device. In
 11  1 making the determination of a person's ability to pay for the
 11  2 cost of a device, the department shall consider not only the
 11  3 person's income, but also the person's other assets, including
 11  4 but not limited to cash, stocks, bonds, and any other property.
 11  5    (2)  The person has an income level greater than one hundred
 11  6 twenty=five percent, but at or below two hundred percent, of
 11  7 the most recently revised poverty income guidelines published
 11  8 by the United States department of health and human services,
 11  9 and the department determines that paying for the ignition
 11 10 interlock device would cause the person substantial hardship.
 11 11 In determining whether substantial hardship would result, the
 11 12 department shall consider not only the person's income, but
 11 13 also the person's other assets, including but not limited to
 11 14 cash, stocks, bonds, and any other property.
 11 15    d.  The department shall adopt rules to administer this
 11 16 subsection, including but not limited to the manner used to
 11 17 determine the monthly ignition interlock user fee and the
 11 18 accepted form and manner in which a person may demonstrate
 11 19 indigency.
 11 20    Sec. 15.  SOBRIETY MONITORING PILOT PROGRAMS.
 11 21    1.  The department of public health, in collaboration
 11 22 with the department of corrections, the department of public
 11 23 safety, and the department of transportation, may approve an
 11 24 application from a county for a countywide sobriety monitoring
 11 25 pilot program that is available twenty=four hours per day,
 11 26 seven days per week, in an effort to reduce the number of
 11 27 crimes related to operating while intoxicated. One application
 11 28 shall be approved for a county with a population of two hundred
 11 29 thousand people or more, one application shall be approved
 11 30 for a county with a population of one hundred thousand people
 11 31 or more but less than two hundred thousand people, and one
 11 32 application shall be approved for a county with a population of
 11 33 less than one hundred thousand people.
 11 34    2.  A sobriety monitoring pilot program shall do all of the
 11 35 following:
 12  1    a.  Require a person who has been charged with, pled guilty
 12  2 to, or been convicted of a violation of section 321J.2 to
 12  3 abstain from all chemical substances for a period of time.
 12  4    b.  Require the person to be subject to testing to determine
 12  5 whether a chemical substance is present in the person's body
 12  6 in the following manner:
 12  7    (1)  At least twice per day at a central location where an
 12  8 immediate sanction can be applied.
 12  9    (2)  Where testing under subparagraph (1) is impractical, by
 12 10 continuous transdermal or electronic monitoring.
 12 11    c.  Apply sanctions when test results definitively, and
 12 12 without presumption, indicate the presence of chemical
 12 13 substances.
 12 14    d.  Require a person participating in the program to pay
 12 15 program costs, including costs of installation, monitoring, and
 12 16 deactivation of any testing devices.
 12 17    e.  Require the person to install an ignition interlock
 12 18 device of a type approved by the commissioner of public safety
 12 19 on all vehicles owned or operated by the person, and require
 12 20 the person to pay the costs associated with the installation
 12 21 and use of the ignition interlock device.
 12 22    3.  A court in a county that has established a pilot program
 12 23 pursuant to this section may order a defendant, as a condition
 12 24 of pretrial release, probation, or bond, to participate in the
 12 25 program.
 12 26    4.  An approved pilot program shall begin on January 15,
 12 27 2017, or upon the effective date of department rules, whichever
 12 28 is earlier, and shall be conducted for a minimum of one year.
 12 29    5.  The department of public health shall adopt rules
 12 30 pursuant to chapter 17A to implement this section including
 12 31 but not limited to provisions relating to applications for,
 12 32 approval of, costs of, and oversight of the pilot programs and
 12 33 reporting requirements for participating counties.
 12 34    6.  The department of public health shall submit a report on
 12 35 the results of the pilot programs and make recommendations to
 13  1 the general assembly by December 15, 2018.
 13  2    7.  For the purposes of this section, "chemical substance"
 13  3 means alcohol, wine, spirits, and beer as defined in section
 13  4 123.3 and controlled substances as defined in section 124.101.
 13  5                           EXPLANATION
 13  6 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
 13  7 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
 13  8    Current law requires a person guilty of operating while
 13  9 intoxicated (OWI) to install an ignition interlock device in
 13 10 the person's vehicle if the person seeks a temporary restricted
 13 11 license, unless the person's alcohol concentration was less
 13 12 than .10 and no accident occurred. This bill strikes that
 13 13 exception, and also requires a person guilty of OWI to install
 13 14 an ignition interlock device in the person's vehicle upon the
 13 15 revocation of the person's driver's license rather than upon
 13 16 the person's application for a temporary restricted license.
 13 17    Under current law, an ignition interlock device is required
 13 18 to be installed in a person's vehicle for the period of time
 13 19 for which the person's temporary restricted license is issued,
 13 20 and up to one additional year after license reinstatement if
 13 21 the person has two or more OWI revocations. The bill requires
 13 22 the permanent installation of an ignition interlock device with
 13 23 two exceptions. If the ignition interlock device was installed
 13 24 as a result of the person's first OWI offense or revocation and
 13 25 a test was obtained, the device shall be uninstalled 180 days
 13 26 after the person's license was revoked, the person last failed
 13 27 a test by the ignition interlock device, or the defendant last
 13 28 failed to maintain the device as required, whichever is latest.
 13 29 If the ignition interlock device was installed as a result of
 13 30 the person's first OWI offense or revocation and a test was
 13 31 refused, the device shall be uninstalled 180 days after the
 13 32 person's license revocation period is over, the person last
 13 33 failed a test by the ignition interlock device, or the person
 13 34 last failed to maintain the device as required, whichever is
 13 35 latest.
 14  1 The bill provides an ignition interlock device shall not
 14  2 be uninstalled if the person has been convicted of a second
 14  3 or subsequent OWI violation, if the person's license has been
 14  4 revoked for a second or subsequent time, or if the person has
 14  5 been convicted of tampering with or circumventing an ignition
 14  6 interlock device.
 14  7    The bill requires the department of transportation (DOT)
 14  8 to assess a monthly ignition interlock user fee to each user
 14  9 of an ignition interlock device. All ignition interlock user
 14 10 fees will be collected by the DOT and deposited in an ignition
 14 11 interlock indigent user fund (IIIUF). The bill requires the
 14 12 DOT to use the moneys in the IIIUF to assist indigent users
 14 13 of ignition interlock devices in paying for the use of the
 14 14 devices. The amount of the monthly ignition interlock user fee
 14 15 shall be set by the DOT so that the moneys in the IIIUF are
 14 16 sufficient to assist all indigent users of ignition interlock
 14 17 devices in paying for the use of the devices.
 14 18    Under the bill, a person is indigent if the person has an
 14 19 income level at or below 125 percent of the U.S. poverty level
 14 20 and the person is unable to pay for the cost of an ignition
 14 21 interlock device. A person is also indigent if the person has
 14 22 an income level greater than 125 percent, but at or below 200
 14 23 percent, of the U.S. poverty level and paying for the ignition
 14 24 interlock device would cause the person substantial hardship.
 14 25    The bill provides for county sobriety monitoring pilot
 14 26 programs. The bill allows the department of public health
 14 27 (DPH), in collaboration with the department of corrections,
 14 28 the department of public safety, and the DOT, to approve
 14 29 applications from counties for countywide sobriety monitoring
 14 30 pilot programs. The programs are to be available 24 hours per
 14 31 day, seven days per week, in an effort to reduce the number
 14 32 of crimes related to OWI.  One application shall be approved
 14 33 for a county with a population of 200,000 people or more, one
 14 34 application shall be approved for a county with a population of
 14 35 100,000 people or more but less than 200,000 people, and one
 15  1 application shall be approved for a county with a population of
 15  2 less than 100,000 people.
 15  3    The programs shall require individuals charged with or
 15  4 convicted of OWI to abstain from all chemical substances for
 15  5 a period of time. The programs are to require testing to
 15  6 determine whether a chemical substance is present at least
 15  7 twice per day at a central location where an immediate sanction
 15  8 can be applied or, where such testing is impractical, by
 15  9 continuous transdermal or electronic monitoring. The programs
 15 10 shall also apply sanctions when test results definitively
 15 11 indicate the presence of a chemical substance. The programs
 15 12 shall require participants to pay program costs and to install
 15 13 an ignition interlock device.
 15 14    A court in a county that has established a pilot program
 15 15 may order a defendant, as a condition of pretrial release,
 15 16 probation, or bond, to participate in the program. Approved
 15 17 pilot programs shall begin January 15, 2017, or upon the
 15 18 effective date of DPH rules, whichever is earlier, and shall
 15 19 be conducted for a minimum of one year. The DPH is to adopt
 15 20 rules to implement the programs, including but not limited to
 15 21 provisions relating to applications for, approval of, costs of,
 15 22 and oversight of the pilot programs and reporting requirements
 15 23 for participating counties. The DPH is directed to submit
 15 24 a report on the results of the pilot programs and make
 15 25 recommendations to the general assembly by December 15, 2018.

  9 33    (c)  The date the defendant last failed to maintain the
  9 34 device as required by 661 IAC ch. 158.
  9 35    b.  An ignition interlock device shall not be uninstalled
 10  1 under this section if the defendant has been convicted of
 10  2 a second or subsequent violation of section 321J.2, if the
 10  3 defendant's license has been revoked for a second or subsequent
 10  4 time under this chapter, or if the defendant has been convicted
 10  5 of tampering with or circumventing an ignition interlock
 10  6 device.
 10  7    c.  The department of public safety, in consultation with the
 10  8 department, may adopt rules to administer this subsection.
 10  9    2.  a.  An ignition interlock indigent user fund is created
 10 10 in the state treasury. The fund shall be administered by
 10 11 the department and shall consist of moneys collected by the
 10 12 department under this subsection. The moneys in the fund are
 10 13 appropriated to and shall be used by the department to assist
 10 14 indigent users of ignition interlock devices in paying for the
 10 15 use of the devices. Notwithstanding section 8.33, moneys in
 10 16 the fund at the end of each fiscal year shall not revert to any
 10 17 other fund but shall remain in the fund for expenditure for
 10 18 subsequent fiscal years.
 10 19    b.  Each month, the department shall assess an ignition
 10 20 interlock user fee to each user of an ignition interlock
 10 21 device. All ignition interlock user fees shall be collected by
 10 22 the department and deposited in the ignition interlock indigent
 10 23 user fund. The amount of the monthly ignition interlock user
 10 24 fee shall be set by the department so that the moneys in the
 10 25 ignition interlock indigent user fund are sufficient to assist
 10 26 all indigent users of ignition interlock devices in paying for
 10 27 the use of the devices.
 10 28    c.  A person is indigent for the purposes of this subsection
 10 29 if any of the following apply:
 10 30    (1)  The person has an income level at or below one hundred
 10 31 twenty=five percent of the United States poverty level as
 10 32 defined by the most recently revised poverty income guidelines
 10 33 published by the United States department of health and human
 10 34 services, and the department determines that the person is
 10 35 unable to pay for the cost of an ignition interlock device. In
 11  1 making the determination of a person's ability to pay for the
 11  2 cost of a device, the department shall consider not only the
 11  3 person's income, but also the person's other assets, including
 11  4 but not limited to cash, stocks, bonds, and any other property.
 11  5    (2)  The person has an income level greater than one hundred

 11  9 and the department determines that paying for the ignition
 11 10 interlock device would cause the person substantial hardship.
 11 11 In determining whether substantial hardship would result, the
 11 12 department shall consider not only the person's income, but
 11 13 also the person's other assets, including but not limited to
 11 14 cash, stocks, bonds, and any other property.
 11 15    d.  The department shall adopt rules to administer this
 11 16 subsection, including but not limited to the manner used to
 11 17 determine the monthly ignition interlock user fee and the
 11 18 accepted form and manner in which a person may demonstrate

 11 20    Sec. 15.  SOBRIETY MONITORING PILOT PROGRAMS.
 11 21    1.  The department of public health, in collaboration
 11 22 with the department of corrections, the department of public
 11 23 safety, and the department of transportation, may approve an
 11 24 application from a county for a countywide sobriety monitoring

 13  5                           EXPLANATION
 13  6 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
 13  7 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
 13  8    Current law requires a person guilty of operating while
 13  9 intoxicated (OWI) to install an ignition interlock device in
 13 10 the person's vehicle if the person seeks a temporary restricted
 13 11 license, unless the person's alcohol concentration was less

 13 29 If the ignition interlock device was installed as a result of
 13 30 the person's first OWI offense or revocation and a test was
 13 31 refused, the device shall be uninstalled 180 days after the
 13 32 person's license revocation period is over, the person last
 13 33 failed a test by the ignition interlock device, or the person
 13 34 last failed to maintain the device as required, whichever is
 13 35 latest.
 14  1 The bill provides an ignition interlock device shall not
 14  2 be uninstalled if the person has been convicted of a second
 14  3 or subsequent OWI violation, if the person's license has been
 14  4 revoked for a second or subsequent time, or if the person has
 14  5 been convicted of tampering with or circumventing an ignition
 14  6 interlock device.
 14  7    The bill requires the department of transportation (DOT)
 14  8 to assess a monthly ignition interlock user fee to each user
 14  9 of an ignition interlock device. All ignition interlock user
 14 10 fees will be collected by the DOT and deposited in an ignition
 14 11 interlock indigent user fund (IIIUF). The bill requires the
 14 12 DOT to use the moneys in the IIIUF to assist indigent users
 14 13 of ignition interlock devices in paying for the use of the
 14 14 devices. The amount of the monthly ignition interlock user fee
 14 15 shall be set by the DOT so that the moneys in the IIIUF are
 14 16 sufficient to assist all indigent users of ignition interlock
 14 17 devices in paying for the use of the devices.
 14 18    Under the bill, a person is indigent if the person has an
 14 19 income level at or below 125 percent of the U.S. poverty level
 14 20 and the person is unable to pay for the cost of an ignition
 14 21 interlock device. A person is also indigent if the person has
 14 22 an income level greater than 125 percent, but at or below 200
 14 23 percent, of the U.S. poverty level and paying for the ignition
 14 24 interlock device would cause the person substantial hardship.

 15  1 application shall be approved for a county with a population of
 15  2 less than 100,000 people.
 15  3    The programs shall require individuals charged with or
 15  4 convicted of OWI to abstain from all chemical substances for

  9 32 exceeded the limit established under 661 IAC 158.6.
  9 33    (c)  The date the defendant last failed to maintain the
  9 34 device as required by 661 IAC ch. 158.
  9 35    b.  An ignition interlock device shall not be uninstalled
 10  1 under this section if the defendant has been convicted of
 10  2 a second or subsequent violation of section 321J.2, if the
 10  3 defendant's license has been revoked for a second or subsequent
 10  4 time under this chapter, or if the defendant has been convicted
 10  5 of tampering with or circumventing an ignition interlock
 10  6 device.
 10  7    c.  The department of public safety, in consultation with the
 10  8 department, may adopt rules to administer this subsection.
 10  9    2.  a.  An ignition interlock indigent user fund is created
 10 10 in the state treasury. The fund shall be administered by
 10 11 the department and shall consist of moneys collected by the
 10 12 department under this subsection. The moneys in the fund are
 10 13 appropriated to and shall be used by the department to assist
 10 14 indigent users of ignition interlock devices in paying for the
 10 15 use of the devices. Notwithstanding section 8.33, moneys in
 10 16 the fund at the end of each fiscal year shall not revert to any
 10 17 other fund but shall remain in the fund for expenditure for
 10 18 subsequent fiscal years.
 10 19    b.  Each month, the department shall assess an ignition
 10 20 interlock user fee to each user of an ignition interlock
 10 21 device. All ignition interlock user fees shall be collected by
 10 22 the department and deposited in the ignition interlock indigent
 10 23 user fund. The amount of the monthly ignition interlock user
 10 24 fee shall be set by the department so that the moneys in the
 10 25 ignition interlock indigent user fund are sufficient to assist
 10 26 all indigent users of ignition interlock devices in paying for
 10 27 the use of the devices.
 10 28    c.  A person is indigent for the purposes of this subsection
 10 29 if any of the following apply:
 10 30    (1)  The person has an income level at or below one hundred
 10 31 twenty=five percent of the United States poverty level as
 10 32 defined by the most recently revised poverty income guidelines
 10 33 published by the United States department of health and human
 10 34 services, and the department determines that the person is
 10 35 unable to pay for the cost of an ignition interlock device. In
 11  1 making the determination of a person's ability to pay for the
 11  2 cost of a device, the department shall consider not only the
 11  3 person's income, but also the person's other assets, including
 11  4 but not limited to cash, stocks, bonds, and any other property.
 11  5    (2)  The person has an income level greater than one hundred
 11  6 twenty=five percent, but at or below two hundred percent, of
 11  7 the most recently revised poverty income guidelines published
 11  8 by the United States department of health and human services,
 11  9 and the department determines that paying for the ignition
 11 10 interlock device would cause the person substantial hardship.
 11 11 In determining whether substantial hardship would result, the
 11 12 department shall consider not only the person's income, but
 11 13 also the person's other assets, including but not limited to
 11 14 cash, stocks, bonds, and any other property.
 11 15    d.  The department shall adopt rules to administer this
 11 16 subsection, including but not limited to the manner used to
 11 17 determine the monthly ignition interlock user fee and the
 11 18 accepted form and manner in which a person may demonstrate
 11 19 indigency.
 11 20    Sec. 15.  SOBRIETY MONITORING PILOT PROGRAMS.
 11 21    1.  The department of public health, in collaboration
 11 22 with the department of corrections, the department of public
 11 23 safety, and the department of transportation, may approve an
 11 24 application from a county for a countywide sobriety monitoring
 11 25 pilot program that is available twenty=four hours per day,
 11 26 seven days per week, in an effort to reduce the number of
 11 27 crimes related to operating while intoxicated. One application
 11 28 shall be approved for a county with a population of two hundred
 11 29 thousand people or more, one application shall be approved
 11 30 for a county with a population of one hundred thousand people
 11 31 or more but less than two hundred thousand people, and one
 11 32 application shall be approved for a county with a population of
 11 33 less than one hundred thousand people.
 11 34    2.  A sobriety monitoring pilot program shall do all of the
 11 35 following:
 12  1    a.  Require a person who has been charged with, pled guilty
 12  2 to, or been convicted of a violation of section 321J.2 to
 12  3 abstain from all chemical substances for a period of time.
 12  4    b.  Require the person to be subject to testing to determine
 12  5 whether a chemical substance is present in the person's body
 12  6 in the following manner:
 12  7    (1)  At least twice per day at a central location where an
 12  8 immediate sanction can be applied.
 12  9    (2)  Where testing under subparagraph (1) is impractical, by
 12 10 continuous transdermal or electronic monitoring.
 12 11    c.  Apply sanctions when test results definitively, and
 12 12 without presumption, indicate the presence of chemical
 12 13 substances.
 12 14    d.  Require a person participating in the program to pay
 12 15 program costs, including costs of installation, monitoring, and
 12 16 deactivation of any testing devices.
 12 17    e.  Require the person to install an ignition interlock
 12 18 device of a type approved by the commissioner of public safety
 12 19 on all vehicles owned or operated by the person, and require
 12 20 the person to pay the costs associated with the installation
 12 21 and use of the ignition interlock device.
 12 22    3.  A court in a county that has established a pilot program
 12 23 pursuant to this section may order a defendant, as a condition
 12 24 of pretrial release, probation, or bond, to participate in the
 12 25 program.
 12 26    4.  An approved pilot program shall begin on January 15,
 12 27 2017, or upon the effective date of department rules, whichever
 12 28 is earlier, and shall be conducted for a minimum of one year.
 12 29    5.  The department of public health shall adopt rules
 12 30 pursuant to chapter 17A to implement this section including
 12 31 but not limited to provisions relating to applications for,
 12 32 approval of, costs of, and oversight of the pilot programs and
 12 33 reporting requirements for participating counties.
 12 34    6.  The department of public health shall submit a report on
 12 35 the results of the pilot programs and make recommendations to
 13  1 the general assembly by December 15, 2018.
 13  2    7.  For the purposes of this section, "chemical substance"
 13  3 means alcohol, wine, spirits, and beer as defined in section
 13  4 123.3 and controlled substances as defined in section 124.101.
 13  5                           EXPLANATION
 13  6 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
 13  7 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
 13  8    Current law requires a person guilty of operating while
 13  9 intoxicated (OWI) to install an ignition interlock device in
 13 10 the person's vehicle if the person seeks a temporary restricted
 13 11 license, unless the person's alcohol concentration was less
 13 12 than .10 and no accident occurred. This bill strikes that
 13 13 exception, and also requires a person guilty of OWI to install
 13 14 an ignition interlock device in the person's vehicle upon the
 13 15 revocation of the person's driver's license rather than upon
 13 16 the person's application for a temporary restricted license.
 13 17    Under current law, an ignition interlock device is required
 13 18 to be installed in a person's vehicle for the period of time
 13 19 for which the person's temporary restricted license is issued,
 13 20 and up to one additional year after license reinstatement if
 13 21 the person has two or more OWI revocations. The bill requires
 13 22 the permanent installation of an ignition interlock device with
 13 23 two exceptions. If the ignition interlock device was installed
 13 24 as a result of the person's first OWI offense or revocation and
 13 25 a test was obtained, the device shall be uninstalled 180 days
 13 26 after the person's license was revoked, the person last failed
 13 27 a test by the ignition interlock device, or the defendant last
 13 28 failed to maintain the device as required, whichever is latest.
 13 29 If the ignition interlock device was installed as a result of
 13 30 the person's first OWI offense or revocation and a test was
 13 31 refused, the device shall be uninstalled 180 days after the
 13 32 person's license revocation period is over, the person last
 13 33 failed a test by the ignition interlock device, or the person
 13 34 last failed to maintain the device as required, whichever is
 13 35 latest.
 14  1 The bill provides an ignition interlock device shall not
 14  2 be uninstalled if the person has been convicted of a second
 14  3 or subsequent OWI violation, if the person's license has been
 14  4 revoked for a second or subsequent time, or if the person has
 14  5 been convicted of tampering with or circumventing an ignition
 14  6 interlock device.
 14  7    The bill requires the department of transportation (DOT)
 14  8 to assess a monthly ignition interlock user fee to each user
 14  9 of an ignition interlock device. All ignition interlock user
 14 10 fees will be collected by the DOT and deposited in an ignition
 14 11 interlock indigent user fund (IIIUF). The bill requires the
 14 12 DOT to use the moneys in the IIIUF to assist indigent users
 14 13 of ignition interlock devices in paying for the use of the
 14 14 devices. The amount of the monthly ignition interlock user fee
 14 15 shall be set by the DOT so that the moneys in the IIIUF are
 14 16 sufficient to assist all indigent users of ignition interlock
 14 17 devices in paying for the use of the devices.
 14 18    Under the bill, a person is indigent if the person has an
 14 19 income level at or below 125 percent of the U.S. poverty level
 14 20 and the person is unable to pay for the cost of an ignition
 14 21 interlock device. A person is also indigent if the person has
 14 22 an income level greater than 125 percent, but at or below 200
 14 23 percent, of the U.S. poverty level and paying for the ignition
 14 24 interlock device would cause the person substantial hardship.
 14 25    The bill provides for county sobriety monitoring pilot
 14 26 programs. The bill allows the department of public health
 14 27 (DPH), in collaboration with the department of corrections,
 14 28 the department of public safety, and the DOT, to approve
 14 29 applications from counties for countywide sobriety monitoring
 14 30 pilot programs. The programs are to be available 24 hours per
 14 31 day, seven days per week, in an effort to reduce the number
 14 32 of crimes related to OWI.  One application shall be approved
 14 33 for a county with a population of 200,000 people or more, one
 14 34 application shall be approved for a county with a population of
 14 35 100,000 people or more but less than 200,000 people, and one
 15  1 application shall be approved for a county with a population of
 15  2 less than 100,000 people.
 15  3    The programs shall require individuals charged with or
 15  4 convicted of OWI to abstain from all chemical substances for
 15  5 a period of time. The programs are to require testing to
 15  6 determine whether a chemical substance is present at least
 15  7 twice per day at a central location where an immediate sanction
 15  8 can be applied or, where such testing is impractical, by
 15  9 continuous transdermal or electronic monitoring. The programs
 15 10 shall also apply sanctions when test results definitively
 15 11 indicate the presence of a chemical substance. The programs
 15 12 shall require participants to pay program costs and to install
 15 13 an ignition interlock device.
 15 14    A court in a county that has established a pilot program
 15 15 may order a defendant, as a condition of pretrial release,
 15 16 probation, or bond, to participate in the program. Approved
 15 17 pilot programs shall begin January 15, 2017, or upon the
 15 18 effective date of DPH rules, whichever is earlier, and shall
 15 19 be conducted for a minimum of one year. The DPH is to adopt
 15 20 rules to implement the programs, including but not limited to
 15 21 provisions relating to applications for, approval of, costs of,
 15 22 and oversight of the pilot programs and reporting requirements
 15 23 for participating counties. The DPH is directed to submit
 15 24 a report on the results of the pilot programs and make
 15 25 recommendations to the general assembly by December 15, 2018.

  9 32 exceeded the limit established under 661 IAC 158.6.
  9 33    (c)  The date the defendant last failed to maintain the
  9 34 device as required by 661 IAC ch. 158.
  9 35    b.  An ignition interlock device shall not be uninstalled
 10  1 under this section if the defendant has been convicted of
 10  2 a second or subsequent violation of section 321J.2, if the
 10  3 defendant's license has been revoked for a second or subsequent
 10  4 time under this chapter, or if the defendant has been convicted
 10  5 of tampering with or circumventing an ignition interlock
 10  6 device.
 10  7    c.  The department of public safety, in consultation with the
 10  8 department, may adopt rules to administer this subsection.
 10  9    2.  a.  An ignition interlock indigent user fund is created
 10 10 in the state treasury. The fund shall be administered by
 10 11 the department and shall consist of moneys collected by the
 10 12 department under this subsection. The moneys in the fund are
 10 13 appropriated to and shall be used by the department to assist
 10 14 indigent users of ignition interlock devices in paying for the
 10 15 use of the devices. Notwithstanding section 8.33, moneys in
 10 16 the fund at the end of each fiscal year shall not revert to any
 10 17 other fund but shall remain in the fund for expenditure for
 10 18 subsequent fiscal years.
 10 19    b.  Each month, the department shall assess an ignition
 10 20 interlock user fee to each user of an ignition interlock
 10 21 device. All ignition interlock user fees shall be collected by
 10 22 the department and deposited in the ignition interlock indigent
 10 23 user fund. The amount of the monthly ignition interlock user
 10 24 fee shall be set by the department so that the moneys in the
 10 25 ignition interlock indigent user fund are sufficient to assist
 10 26 all indigent users of ignition interlock devices in paying for
 10 27 the use of the devices.
 10 28    c.  A person is indigent for the purposes of this subsection
 10 29 if any of the following apply:
 10 30    (1)  The person has an income level at or below one hundred
 10 31 twenty=five percent of the United States poverty level as
 10 32 defined by the most recently revised poverty income guidelines
 10 33 published by the United States department of health and human
 10 34 services, and the department determines that the person is
 10 35 unable to pay for the cost of an ignition interlock device. In
 11  1 making the determination of a person's ability to pay for the
 11  2 cost of a device, the department shall consider not only the
 11  3 person's income, but also the person's other assets, including
 11  4 but not limited to cash, stocks, bonds, and any other property.
 11  5    (2)  The person has an income level greater than one hundred
 11  6 twenty=five percent, but at or below two hundred percent, of
 11  7 the most recently revised poverty income guidelines published
 11  8 by the United States department of health and human services,
 11  9 and the department determines that paying for the ignition
 11 10 interlock device would cause the person substantial hardship.
 11 11 In determining whether substantial hardship would result, the
 11 12 department shall consider not only the person's income, but
 11 13 also the person's other assets, including but not limited to
 11 14 cash, stocks, bonds, and any other property.
 11 15    d.  The department shall adopt rules to administer this
 11 16 subsection, including but not limited to the manner used to
 11 17 determine the monthly ignition interlock user fee and the
 11 18 accepted form and manner in which a person may demonstrate
 11 19 indigency.
 11 20    Sec. 15.  SOBRIETY MONITORING PILOT PROGRAMS.
 11 21    1.  The department of public health, in collaboration
 11 22 with the department of corrections, the department of public
 11 23 safety, and the department of transportation, may approve an
 11 24 application from a county for a countywide sobriety monitoring
 11 25 pilot program that is available twenty=four hours per day,
 11 26 seven days per week, in an effort to reduce the number of
 11 27 crimes related to operating while intoxicated. One application
 11 28 shall be approved for a county with a population of two hundred
 11 29 thousand people or more, one application shall be approved
 11 30 for a county with a population of one hundred thousand people
 11 31 or more but less than two hundred thousand people, and one
 11 32 application shall be approved for a county with a population of
 11 33 less than one hundred thousand people.
 11 34    2.  A sobriety monitoring pilot program shall do all of the
 11 35 following:
 12  1    a.  Require a person who has been charged with, pled guilty
 12  2 to, or been convicted of a violation of section 321J.2 to
 12  3 abstain from all chemical substances for a period of time.
 12  4    b.  Require the person to be subject to testing to determine
 12  5 whether a chemical substance is present in the person's body
 12  6 in the following manner:

 12 17    e.  Require the person to install an ignition interlock
 12 18 device of a type approved by the commissioner of public safety
 12 19 on all vehicles owned or operated by the person, and require
 12 20 the person to pay the costs associated with the installation
 12 21 and use of the ignition interlock device.
 12 22    3.  A court in a county that has established a pilot program
 12 23 pursuant to this section may order a defendant, as a condition
 12 24 of pretrial release, probation, or bond, to participate in the
 12 25 program.
 12 26    4.  An approved pilot program shall begin on January 15,

 12 34    6.  The department of public health shall submit a report on
 12 35 the results of the pilot programs and make recommendations to
 13  1 the general assembly by December 15, 2018.
 13  2    7.  For the purposes of this section, "chemical substance"
 13  3 means alcohol, wine, spirits, and beer as defined in section
 13  4 123.3 and controlled substances as defined in section 124.101.
 13  5                           EXPLANATION
 13  6 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
 13  7 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
 13  8    Current law requires a person guilty of operating while
 13  9 intoxicated (OWI) to install an ignition interlock device in
 13 10 the person's vehicle if the person seeks a temporary restricted
 13 11 license, unless the person's alcohol concentration was less
 13 12 than .10 and no accident occurred. This bill strikes that
 13 13 exception, and also requires a person guilty of OWI to install
 13 14 an ignition interlock device in the person's vehicle upon the
 13 15 revocation of the person's driver's license rather than upon
 13 16 the person's application for a temporary restricted license.
 13 17    Under current law, an ignition interlock device is required
 13 18 to be installed in a person's vehicle for the period of time
 13 19 for which the person's temporary restricted license is issued,
 13 20 and up to one additional year after license reinstatement if
 13 21 the person has two or more OWI revocations. The bill requires
 13 22 the permanent installation of an ignition interlock device with
 13 23 two exceptions. If the ignition interlock device was installed
 13 24 as a result of the person's first OWI offense or revocation and
 13 25 a test was obtained, the device shall be uninstalled 180 days
 13 26 after the person's license was revoked, the person last failed
 13 27 a test by the ignition interlock device, or the defendant last
 13 28 failed to maintain the device as required, whichever is latest.
 13 29 If the ignition interlock device was installed as a result of
 13 30 the person's first OWI offense or revocation and a test was
 13 31 refused, the device shall be uninstalled 180 days after the
 13 32 person's license revocation period is over, the person last
 13 33 failed a test by the ignition interlock device, or the person
 13 34 last failed to maintain the device as required, whichever is
 13 35 latest.
 14  1 The bill provides an ignition interlock device shall not
 14  2 be uninstalled if the person has been convicted of a second
 14  3 or subsequent OWI violation, if the person's license has been
 14  4 revoked for a second or subsequent time, or if the person has
 14  5 been convicted of tampering with or circumventing an ignition
 14  6 interlock device.
 14  7    The bill requires the department of transportation (DOT)
 14  8 to assess a monthly ignition interlock user fee to each user
 14  9 of an ignition interlock device. All ignition interlock user
 14 10 fees will be collected by the DOT and deposited in an ignition
 14 11 interlock indigent user fund (IIIUF). The bill requires the
 14 12 DOT to use the moneys in the IIIUF to assist indigent users
 14 13 of ignition interlock devices in paying for the use of the
 14 14 devices. The amount of the monthly ignition interlock user fee
 14 15 shall be set by the DOT so that the moneys in the IIIUF are
 14 16 sufficient to assist all indigent users of ignition interlock
 14 17 devices in paying for the use of the devices.
 14 18    Under the bill, a person is indigent if the person has an
 14 19 income level at or below 125 percent of the U.S. poverty level
 14 20 and the person is unable to pay for the cost of an ignition
 14 21 interlock device. A person is also indigent if the person has
 14 22 an income level greater than 125 percent, but at or below 200
 14 23 percent, of the U.S. poverty level and paying for the ignition
 14 24 interlock device would cause the person substantial hardship.
 14 25    The bill provides for county sobriety monitoring pilot
 14 26 programs. The bill allows the department of public health
 14 27 (DPH), in collaboration with the department of corrections,
 14 28 the department of public safety, and the DOT, to approve
 14 29 applications from counties for countywide sobriety monitoring
 14 30 pilot programs. The programs are to be available 24 hours per
 14 31 day, seven days per week, in an effort to reduce the number
 14 32 of crimes related to OWI.  One application shall be approved
 14 33 for a county with a population of 200,000 people or more, one
 14 34 application shall be approved for a county with a population of
 14 35 100,000 people or more but less than 200,000 people, and one
 15  1 application shall be approved for a county with a population of
 15  2 less than 100,000 people.
 15  3    The programs shall require individuals charged with or
 15  4 convicted of OWI to abstain from all chemical substances for
 15  5 a period of time. The programs are to require testing to
 15  6 determine whether a chemical substance is present at least
 15  7 twice per day at a central location where an immediate sanction
 15  8 can be applied or, where such testing is impractical, by
 15  9 continuous transdermal or electronic monitoring. The programs
 15 10 shall also apply sanctions when test results definitively
 15 11 indicate the presence of a chemical substance. The programs
 15 12 shall require participants to pay program costs and to install
 15 13 an ignition interlock device.
 15 14    A court in a county that has established a pilot program

 10  7    c.  The department of public safety, in consultation with the
 10  8 department, may adopt rules to administer this subsection.
 10  9    2.  a.  An ignition interlock indigent user fund is created
 10 10 in the state treasury. The fund shall be administered by
 10 11 the department and shall consist of moneys collected by the
 10 12 department under this subsection. The moneys in the fund are
 10 13 appropriated to and shall be used by the department to assist
 10 14 indigent users of ignition interlock devices in paying for the
 10 15 use of the devices. Notwithstanding section 8.33, moneys in
 10 16 the fund at the end of each fiscal year shall not revert to any
 10 17 other fund but shall remain in the fund for expenditure for
 10 18 subsequent fiscal years.
 10 19    b.  Each month, the department shall assess an ignition
 10 20 interlock user fee to each user of an ignition interlock
 10 21 device. All ignition interlock user fees shall be collected by
 10 22 the department and deposited in the ignition interlock indigent
 10 23 user fund. The amount of the monthly ignition interlock user
 10 24 fee shall be set by the department so that the moneys in the
 10 25 ignition interlock indigent user fund are sufficient to assist
 10 26 all indigent users of ignition interlock devices in paying for
 10 27 the use of the devices.
 10 28    c.  A person is indigent for the purposes of this subsection
 10 29 if any of the following apply:
 10 30    (1)  The person has an income level at or below one hundred
 10 31 twenty=five percent of the United States poverty level as
 10 32 defined by the most recently revised poverty income guidelines
 10 33 published by the United States department of health and human
 10 34 services, and the department determines that the person is
 10 35 unable to pay for the cost of an ignition interlock device. In
 11  1 making the determination of a person's ability to pay for the
 11  2 cost of a device, the department shall consider not only the
 11  3 person's income, but also the person's other assets, including
 11  4 but not limited to cash, stocks, bonds, and any other property.
 11  5    (2)  The person has an income level greater than one hundred
 11  6 twenty=five percent, but at or below two hundred percent, of
 11  7 the most recently revised poverty income guidelines published
 11  8 by the United States department of health and human services,
 11  9 and the department determines that paying for the ignition
 11 10 interlock device would cause the person substantial hardship.
 11 11 In determining whether substantial hardship would result, the
 11 12 department shall consider not only the person's income, but
 11 13 also the person's other assets, including but not limited to
 11 14 cash, stocks, bonds, and any other property.
 11 15    d.  The department shall adopt rules to administer this
 11 16 subsection, including but not limited to the manner used to
 11 17 determine the monthly ignition interlock user fee and the
 11 18 accepted form and manner in which a person may demonstrate
 11 19 indigency.
 11 20    Sec. 15.  SOBRIETY MONITORING PILOT PROGRAMS.
 11 21    1.  The department of public health, in collaboration
 11 22 with the department of corrections, the department of public
 11 23 safety, and the department of transportation, may approve an
 11 24 application from a county for a countywide sobriety monitoring
 11 25 pilot program that is available twenty=four hours per day,
 11 26 seven days per week, in an effort to reduce the number of
 11 27 crimes related to operating while intoxicated. One application
 11 28 shall be approved for a county with a population of two hundred
 11 29 thousand people or more, one application shall be approved
 11 30 for a county with a population of one hundred thousand people
 11 31 or more but less than two hundred thousand people, and one
 11 32 application shall be approved for a county with a population of
 11 33 less than one hundred thousand people.
 11 34    2.  A sobriety monitoring pilot program shall do all of the
 11 35 following:
 12  1    a.  Require a person who has been charged with, pled guilty
 12  2 to, or been convicted of a violation of section 321J.2 to
 12  3 abstain from all chemical substances for a period of time.
 12  4    b.  Require the person to be subject to testing to determine
 12  5 whether a chemical substance is present in the person's body
 12  6 in the following manner:
 12  7    (1)  At least twice per day at a central location where an
 12  8 immediate sanction can be applied.
 12  9    (2)  Where testing under subparagraph (1) is impractical, by
 12 10 continuous transdermal or electronic monitoring.
 12 11    c.  Apply sanctions when test results definitively, and
 12 12 without presumption, indicate the presence of chemical
 12 13 substances.
 12 14    d.  Require a person participating in the program to pay
 12 15 program costs, including costs of installation, monitoring, and
 12 16 deactivation of any testing devices.
 12 17    e.  Require the person to install an ignition interlock
 12 18 device of a type approved by the commissioner of public safety
 12 19 on all vehicles owned or operated by the person, and require
 12 20 the person to pay the costs associated with the installation
 12 21 and use of the ignition interlock device.
 12 22    3.  A court in a county that has established a pilot program
 12 23 pursuant to this section may order a defendant, as a condition
 12 24 of pretrial release, probation, or bond, to participate in the
 12 25 program.
 12 26    4.  An approved pilot program shall begin on January 15,
 12 27 2017, or upon the effective date of department rules, whichever
 12 28 is earlier, and shall be conducted for a minimum of one year.
 12 29    5.  The department of public health shall adopt rules
 12 30 pursuant to chapter 17A to implement this section including
 12 31 but not limited to provisions relating to applications for,
 12 32 approval of, costs of, and oversight of the pilot programs and
 12 33 reporting requirements for participating counties.
 12 34    6.  The department of public health shall submit a report on
 12 35 the results of the pilot programs and make recommendations to
 13  1 the general assembly by December 15, 2018.
 13  2    7.  For the purposes of this section, "chemical substance"
 13  3 means alcohol, wine, spirits, and beer as defined in section
 13  4 123.3 and controlled substances as defined in section 124.101.
 13  5                           EXPLANATION
 13  6 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
 13  7 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
 13  8    Current law requires a person guilty of operating while
 13  9 intoxicated (OWI) to install an ignition interlock device in
 13 10 the person's vehicle if the person seeks a temporary restricted
 13 11 license, unless the person's alcohol concentration was less
 13 12 than .10 and no accident occurred. This bill strikes that
 13 13 exception, and also requires a person guilty of OWI to install
 13 14 an ignition interlock device in the person's vehicle upon the
 13 15 revocation of the person's driver's license rather than upon
 13 16 the person's application for a temporary restricted license.
 13 17    Under current law, an ignition interlock device is required
 13 18 to be installed in a person's vehicle for the period of time
 13 19 for which the person's temporary restricted license is issued,
 13 20 and up to one additional year after license reinstatement if
 13 21 the person has two or more OWI revocations. The bill requires
 13 22 the permanent installation of an ignition interlock device with
 13 23 two exceptions. If the ignition interlock device was installed
 13 24 as a result of the person's first OWI offense or revocation and
 13 25 a test was obtained, the device shall be uninstalled 180 days
 13 26 after the person's license was revoked, the person last failed
 13 27 a test by the ignition interlock device, or the defendant last
 13 28 failed to maintain the device as required, whichever is latest.
 13 29 If the ignition interlock device was installed as a result of
 13 30 the person's first OWI offense or revocation and a test was
 13 31 refused, the device shall be uninstalled 180 days after the
 13 32 person's license revocation period is over, the person last
 13 33 failed a test by the ignition interlock device, or the person
 13 34 last failed to maintain the device as required, whichever is
 13 35 latest.
 14  1 The bill provides an ignition interlock device shall not
 14  2 be uninstalled if the person has been convicted of a second
 14  3 or subsequent OWI violation, if the person's license has been
 14  4 revoked for a second or subsequent time, or if the person has
 14  5 been convicted of tampering with or circumventing an ignition
 14  6 interlock device.
 14  7    The bill requires the department of transportation (DOT)
 14  8 to assess a monthly ignition interlock user fee to each user
 14  9 of an ignition interlock device. All ignition interlock user
 14 10 fees will be collected by the DOT and deposited in an ignition
 14 11 interlock indigent user fund (IIIUF). The bill requires the
 14 12 DOT to use the moneys in the IIIUF to assist indigent users
 14 13 of ignition interlock devices in paying for the use of the
 14 14 devices. The amount of the monthly ignition interlock user fee
 14 15 shall be set by the DOT so that the moneys in the IIIUF are
 14 16 sufficient to assist all indigent users of ignition interlock
 14 17 devices in paying for the use of the devices.
 14 18    Under the bill, a person is indigent if the person has an
 14 19 income level at or below 125 percent of the U.S. poverty level
 14 20 and the person is unable to pay for the cost of an ignition
 14 21 interlock device. A person is also indigent if the person has
 14 22 an income level greater than 125 percent, but at or below 200
 14 23 percent, of the U.S. poverty level and paying for the ignition
 14 24 interlock device would cause the person substantial hardship.
 14 25    The bill provides for county sobriety monitoring pilot
 14 26 programs. The bill allows the department of public health
 14 27 (DPH), in collaboration with the department of corrections,
 14 28 the department of public safety, and the DOT, to approve
 14 29 applications from counties for countywide sobriety monitoring
 14 30 pilot programs. The programs are to be available 24 hours per
 14 31 day, seven days per week, in an effort to reduce the number
 14 32 of crimes related to OWI.  One application shall be approved
 14 33 for a county with a population of 200,000 people or more, one
 14 34 application shall be approved for a county with a population of
 14 35 100,000 people or more but less than 200,000 people, and one
 15  1 application shall be approved for a county with a population of
 15  2 less than 100,000 people.
 15  3    The programs shall require individuals charged with or
 15  4 convicted of OWI to abstain from all chemical substances for
 15  5 a period of time. The programs are to require testing to
 15  6 determine whether a chemical substance is present at least
 15  7 twice per day at a central location where an immediate sanction
 15  8 can be applied or, where such testing is impractical, by
 15  9 continuous transdermal or electronic monitoring. The programs
 15 10 shall also apply sanctions when test results definitively
 15 11 indicate the presence of a chemical substance. The programs
 15 12 shall require participants to pay program costs and to install
 15 13 an ignition interlock device.
 15 14    A court in a county that has established a pilot program
 15 15 may order a defendant, as a condition of pretrial release,
 15 16 probation, or bond, to participate in the program. Approved
 15 17 pilot programs shall begin January 15, 2017, or upon the
 15 18 effective date of DPH rules, whichever is earlier, and shall
 15 19 be conducted for a minimum of one year. The DPH is to adopt
 15 20 rules to implement the programs, including but not limited to
 15 21 provisions relating to applications for, approval of, costs of,
 15 22 and oversight of the pilot programs and reporting requirements
 15 23 for participating counties. The DPH is directed to submit
 15 24 a report on the results of the pilot programs and make
 15 25 recommendations to the general assembly by December 15, 2018.

 11 20    Sec. 15.  SOBRIETY MONITORING PILOT PROGRAMS.
 11 21    1.  The department of public health, in collaboration
 11 22 with the department of corrections, the department of public
 11 23 safety, and the department of transportation, may approve an

 13  4 123.3 and controlled substances as defined in section 124.101.
 13  5                           EXPLANATION
 13  6 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
 13  7 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
 13  8    Current law requires a person guilty of operating while
 13  9 intoxicated (OWI) to install an ignition interlock device in
 13 10 the person's vehicle if the person seeks a temporary restricted
 13 11 license, unless the person's alcohol concentration was less
 13 12 than .10 and no accident occurred. This bill strikes that
 13 13 exception, and also requires a person guilty of OWI to install
 13 14 an ignition interlock device in the person's vehicle upon the
 13 15 revocation of the person's driver's license rather than upon
 13 16 the person's application for a temporary restricted license.
 13 17    Under current law, an ignition interlock device is required
 13 18 to be installed in a person's vehicle for the period of time
 13 19 for which the person's temporary restricted license is issued,

 13 26 after the person's license was revoked, the person last failed
 13 27 a test by the ignition interlock device, or the defendant last
 13 28 failed to maintain the device as required, whichever is latest.
 13 29 If the ignition interlock device was installed as a result of
 13 30 the person's first OWI offense or revocation and a test was
 13 31 refused, the device shall be uninstalled 180 days after the
 13 32 person's license revocation period is over, the person last
 13 33 failed a test by the ignition interlock device, or the person
 13 34 last failed to maintain the device as required, whichever is
 13 35 latest.
 14  1 The bill provides an ignition interlock device shall not
 14  2 be uninstalled if the person has been convicted of a second
 14  3 or subsequent OWI violation, if the person's license has been
 14  4 revoked for a second or subsequent time, or if the person has
 14  5 been convicted of tampering with or circumventing an ignition
 14  6 interlock device.
 14  7    The bill requires the department of transportation (DOT)
 14  8 to assess a monthly ignition interlock user fee to each user
 14  9 of an ignition interlock device. All ignition interlock user
 14 10 fees will be collected by the DOT and deposited in an ignition
 14 11 interlock indigent user fund (IIIUF). The bill requires the
 14 12 DOT to use the moneys in the IIIUF to assist indigent users
 14 13 of ignition interlock devices in paying for the use of the
 14 14 devices. The amount of the monthly ignition interlock user fee
 14 15 shall be set by the DOT so that the moneys in the IIIUF are
 14 16 sufficient to assist all indigent users of ignition interlock
 14 17 devices in paying for the use of the devices.
 14 18    Under the bill, a person is indigent if the person has an
 14 19 income level at or below 125 percent of the U.S. poverty level
 14 20 and the person is unable to pay for the cost of an ignition
 14 21 interlock device. A person is also indigent if the person has
 14 22 an income level greater than 125 percent, but at or below 200
 14 23 percent, of the U.S. poverty level and paying for the ignition
 14 24 interlock device would cause the person substantial hardship.
 14 25    The bill provides for county sobriety monitoring pilot
 14 26 programs. The bill allows the department of public health
 14 27 (DPH), in collaboration with the department of corrections,
 14 28 the department of public safety, and the DOT, to approve

 14 34 application shall be approved for a county with a population of
 14 35 100,000 people or more but less than 200,000 people, and one
 15  1 application shall be approved for a county with a population of
 15  2 less than 100,000 people.
 15  3    The programs shall require individuals charged with or
 15  4 convicted of OWI to abstain from all chemical substances for
 15  5 a period of time. The programs are to require testing to
 15  6 determine whether a chemical substance is present at least
 15  7 twice per day at a central location where an immediate sanction
 15  8 can be applied or, where such testing is impractical, by
 15  9 continuous transdermal or electronic monitoring. The programs
 15 10 shall also apply sanctions when test results definitively
 15 11 indicate the presence of a chemical substance. The programs
 15 12 shall require participants to pay program costs and to install
 15 13 an ignition interlock device.
 15 14    A court in a county that has established a pilot program
 15 15 may order a defendant, as a condition of pretrial release,
 15 16 probation, or bond, to participate in the program. Approved
 15 17 pilot programs shall begin January 15, 2017, or upon the
 15 18 effective date of DPH rules, whichever is earlier, and shall
 15 19 be conducted for a minimum of one year. The DPH is to adopt
 15 20 rules to implement the programs, including but not limited to
 15 21 provisions relating to applications for, approval of, costs of,
 15 22 and oversight of the pilot programs and reporting requirements
 15 23 for participating counties. The DPH is directed to submit
 15 24 a report on the results of the pilot programs and make
 15 25 recommendations to the general assembly by December 15, 2018.

  9 34 device as required by 661 IAC ch. 158.
  9 35    b.  An ignition interlock device shall not be uninstalled
 10  1 under this section if the defendant has been convicted of
 10  2 a second or subsequent violation of section 321J.2, if the
 10  3 defendant's license has been revoked for a second or subsequent
 10  4 time under this chapter, or if the defendant has been convicted
 10  5 of tampering with or circumventing an ignition interlock
 10  6 device.
 10  7    c.  The department of public safety, in consultation with the
 10  8 department, may adopt rules to administer this subsection.
 10  9    2.  a.  An ignition interlock indigent user fund is created
 10 10 in the state treasury. The fund shall be administered by
 10 11 the department and shall consist of moneys collected by the
 10 12 department under this subsection. The moneys in the fund are
 10 13 appropriated to and shall be used by the department to assist
 10 14 indigent users of ignition interlock devices in paying for the
 10 15 use of the devices. Notwithstanding section 8.33, moneys in
 10 16 the fund at the end of each fiscal year shall not revert to any
 10 17 other fund but shall remain in the fund for expenditure for
 10 18 subsequent fiscal years.
 10 19    b.  Each month, the department shall assess an ignition
 10 20 interlock user fee to each user of an ignition interlock
 10 21 device. All ignition interlock user fees shall be collected by
 10 22 the department and deposited in the ignition interlock indigent
 10 23 user fund. The amount of the monthly ignition interlock user
 10 24 fee shall be set by the department so that the moneys in the
 10 25 ignition interlock indigent user fund are sufficient to assist
 10 26 all indigent users of ignition interlock devices in paying for
 10 27 the use of the devices.
 10 28    c.  A person is indigent for the purposes of this subsection
 10 29 if any of the following apply:
 10 30    (1)  The person has an income level at or below one hundred
 10 31 twenty=five percent of the United States poverty level as
 10 32 defined by the most recently revised poverty income guidelines
 10 33 published by the United States department of health and human
 10 34 services, and the department determines that the person is
 10 35 unable to pay for the cost of an ignition interlock device. In
 11  1 making the determination of a person's ability to pay for the
 11  2 cost of a device, the department shall consider not only the
 11  3 person's income, but also the person's other assets, including
 11  4 but not limited to cash, stocks, bonds, and any other property.
 11  5    (2)  The person has an income level greater than one hundred
 11  6 twenty=five percent, but at or below two hundred percent, of
 11  7 the most recently revised poverty income guidelines published
 11  8 by the United States department of health and human services,
 11  9 and the department determines that paying for the ignition
 11 10 interlock device would cause the person substantial hardship.
 11 11 In determining whether substantial hardship would result, the
 11 12 department shall consider not only the person's income, but
 11 13 also the person's other assets, including but not limited to
 11 14 cash, stocks, bonds, and any other property.
 11 15    d.  The department shall adopt rules to administer this
 11 16 subsection, including but not limited to the manner used to
 11 17 determine the monthly ignition interlock user fee and the
 11 18 accepted form and manner in which a person may demonstrate
 11 19 indigency.
 11 20    Sec. 15.  SOBRIETY MONITORING PILOT PROGRAMS.
 11 21    1.  The department of public health, in collaboration
 11 22 with the department of corrections, the department of public
 11 23 safety, and the department of transportation, may approve an
 11 24 application from a county for a countywide sobriety monitoring
 11 25 pilot program that is available twenty=four hours per day,
 11 26 seven days per week, in an effort to reduce the number of
 11 27 crimes related to operating while intoxicated. One application
 11 28 shall be approved for a county with a population of two hundred
 11 29 thousand people or more, one application shall be approved
 11 30 for a county with a population of one hundred thousand people
 11 31 or more but less than two hundred thousand people, and one
 11 32 application shall be approved for a county with a population of
 11 33 less than one hundred thousand people.
 11 34    2.  A sobriety monitoring pilot program shall do all of the
 11 35 following:
 12  1    a.  Require a person who has been charged with, pled guilty
 12  2 to, or been convicted of a violation of section 321J.2 to
 12  3 abstain from all chemical substances for a period of time.
 12  4    b.  Require the person to be subject to testing to determine
 12  5 whether a chemical substance is present in the person's body
 12  6 in the following manner:
 12  7    (1)  At least twice per day at a central location where an
 12  8 immediate sanction can be applied.
 12  9    (2)  Where testing under subparagraph (1) is impractical, by
 12 10 continuous transdermal or electronic monitoring.
 12 11    c.  Apply sanctions when test results definitively, and
 12 12 without presumption, indicate the presence of chemical
 12 13 substances.
 12 14    d.  Require a person participating in the program to pay
 12 15 program costs, including costs of installation, monitoring, and
 12 16 deactivation of any testing devices.
 12 17    e.  Require the person to install an ignition interlock
 12 18 device of a type approved by the commissioner of public safety
 12 19 on all vehicles owned or operated by the person, and require
 12 20 the person to pay the costs associated with the installation
 12 21 and use of the ignition interlock device.
 12 22    3.  A court in a county that has established a pilot program
 12 23 pursuant to this section may order a defendant, as a condition
 12 24 of pretrial release, probation, or bond, to participate in the
 12 25 program.
 12 26    4.  An approved pilot program shall begin on January 15,
 12 27 2017, or upon the effective date of department rules, whichever
 12 28 is earlier, and shall be conducted for a minimum of one year.
 12 29    5.  The department of public health shall adopt rules
 12 30 pursuant to chapter 17A to implement this section including
 12 31 but not limited to provisions relating to applications for,
 12 32 approval of, costs of, and oversight of the pilot programs and
 12 33 reporting requirements for participating counties.
 12 34    6.  The department of public health shall submit a report on
 12 35 the results of the pilot programs and make recommendations to
 13  1 the general assembly by December 15, 2018.
 13  2    7.  For the purposes of this section, "chemical substance"
 13  3 means alcohol, wine, spirits, and beer as defined in section
 13  4 123.3 and controlled substances as defined in section 124.101.
 13  5                           EXPLANATION
 13  6 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
 13  7 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
 13  8    Current law requires a person guilty of operating while
 13  9 intoxicated (OWI) to install an ignition interlock device in
 13 10 the person's vehicle if the person seeks a temporary restricted
 13 11 license, unless the person's alcohol concentration was less
 13 12 than .10 and no accident occurred. This bill strikes that
 13 13 exception, and also requires a person guilty of OWI to install
 13 14 an ignition interlock device in the person's vehicle upon the
 13 15 revocation of the person's driver's license rather than upon
 13 16 the person's application for a temporary restricted license.
 13 17    Under current law, an ignition interlock device is required
 13 18 to be installed in a person's vehicle for the period of time
 13 19 for which the person's temporary restricted license is issued,
 13 20 and up to one additional year after license reinstatement if
 13 21 the person has two or more OWI revocations. The bill requires
 13 22 the permanent installation of an ignition interlock device with
 13 23 two exceptions. If the ignition interlock device was installed
 13 24 as a result of the person's first OWI offense or revocation and
 13 25 a test was obtained, the device shall be uninstalled 180 days
 13 26 after the person's license was revoked, the person last failed
 13 27 a test by the ignition interlock device, or the defendant last
 13 28 failed to maintain the device as required, whichever is latest.
 13 29 If the ignition interlock device was installed as a result of
 13 30 the person's first OWI offense or revocation and a test was
 13 31 refused, the device shall be uninstalled 180 days after the
 13 32 person's license revocation period is over, the person last
 13 33 failed a test by the ignition interlock device, or the person
 13 34 last failed to maintain the device as required, whichever is
 13 35 latest.
 14  1 The bill provides an ignition interlock device shall not
 14  2 be uninstalled if the person has been convicted of a second
 14  3 or subsequent OWI violation, if the person's license has been
 14  4 revoked for a second or subsequent time, or if the person has
 14  5 been convicted of tampering with or circumventing an ignition
 14  6 interlock device.
 14  7    The bill requires the department of transportation (DOT)
 14  8 to assess a monthly ignition interlock user fee to each user
 14  9 of an ignition interlock device. All ignition interlock user
 14 10 fees will be collected by the DOT and deposited in an ignition
 14 11 interlock indigent user fund (IIIUF). The bill requires the
 14 12 DOT to use the moneys in the IIIUF to assist indigent users
 14 13 of ignition interlock devices in paying for the use of the
 14 14 devices. The amount of the monthly ignition interlock user fee
 14 15 shall be set by the DOT so that the moneys in the IIIUF are
 14 16 sufficient to assist all indigent users of ignition interlock
 14 17 devices in paying for the use of the devices.
 14 18    Under the bill, a person is indigent if the person has an
 14 19 income level at or below 125 percent of the U.S. poverty level
 14 20 and the person is unable to pay for the cost of an ignition
 14 21 interlock device. A person is also indigent if the person has
 14 22 an income level greater than 125 percent, but at or below 200
 14 23 percent, of the U.S. poverty level and paying for the ignition
 14 24 interlock device would cause the person substantial hardship.
 14 25    The bill provides for county sobriety monitoring pilot
 14 26 programs. The bill allows the department of public health
 14 27 (DPH), in collaboration with the department of corrections,
 14 28 the department of public safety, and the DOT, to approve
 14 29 applications from counties for countywide sobriety monitoring
 14 30 pilot programs. The programs are to be available 24 hours per
 14 31 day, seven days per week, in an effort to reduce the number
 14 32 of crimes related to OWI.  One application shall be approved
 14 33 for a county with a population of 200,000 people or more, one
 14 34 application shall be approved for a county with a population of
 14 35 100,000 people or more but less than 200,000 people, and one
 15  1 application shall be approved for a county with a population of
 15  2 less than 100,000 people.
 15  3    The programs shall require individuals charged with or
 15  4 convicted of OWI to abstain from all chemical substances for
 15  5 a period of time. The programs are to require testing to
 15  6 determine whether a chemical substance is present at least
 15  7 twice per day at a central location where an immediate sanction
 15  8 can be applied or, where such testing is impractical, by
 15  9 continuous transdermal or electronic monitoring. The programs
 15 10 shall also apply sanctions when test results definitively
 15 11 indicate the presence of a chemical substance. The programs
 15 12 shall require participants to pay program costs and to install
 15 13 an ignition interlock device.
 15 14    A court in a county that has established a pilot program
 15 15 may order a defendant, as a condition of pretrial release,
 15 16 probation, or bond, to participate in the program. Approved
 15 17 pilot programs shall begin January 15, 2017, or upon the
 15 18 effective date of DPH rules, whichever is earlier, and shall
 15 19 be conducted for a minimum of one year. The DPH is to adopt
 15 20 rules to implement the programs, including but not limited to
 15 21 provisions relating to applications for, approval of, costs of,
 15 22 and oversight of the pilot programs and reporting requirements
 15 23 for participating counties. The DPH is directed to submit
 15 24 a report on the results of the pilot programs and make
 15 25 recommendations to the general assembly by December 15, 2018.

 13  5                           EXPLANATION
 13  6 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with

 14 32 of crimes related to OWI.  One application shall be approved
 14 33 for a county with a population of 200,000 people or more, one
 14 34 application shall be approved for a county with a population of
 14 35 100,000 people or more but less than 200,000 people, and one
 15  1 application shall be approved for a county with a population of
 15  2 less than 100,000 people.
 15  3    The programs shall require individuals charged with or
 15  4 convicted of OWI to abstain from all chemical substances for
 15  5 a period of time. The programs are to require testing to
 15  6 determine whether a chemical substance is present at least
 15  7 twice per day at a central location where an immediate sanction
 15  8 can be applied or, where such testing is impractical, by
 15  9 continuous transdermal or electronic monitoring. The programs
 15 10 shall also apply sanctions when test results definitively
 15 11 indicate the presence of a chemical substance. The programs
 15 12 shall require participants to pay program costs and to install
 15 13 an ignition interlock device.
 15 14    A court in a county that has established a pilot program
 15 15 may order a defendant, as a condition of pretrial release,
 15 16 probation, or bond, to participate in the program. Approved
 15 17 pilot programs shall begin January 15, 2017, or upon the
 15 18 effective date of DPH rules, whichever is earlier, and shall
 15 19 be conducted for a minimum of one year. The DPH is to adopt
 15 20 rules to implement the programs, including but not limited to
 15 21 provisions relating to applications for, approval of, costs of,
 15 22 and oversight of the pilot programs and reporting requirements
 15 23 for participating counties. The DPH is directed to submit
 15 24 a report on the results of the pilot programs and make
 15 25 recommendations to the general assembly by December 15, 2018.

 10  1 under this section if the defendant has been convicted of
 10  2 a second or subsequent violation of section 321J.2, if the
 10  3 defendant's license has been revoked for a second or subsequent
 10  4 time under this chapter, or if the defendant has been convicted
 10  5 of tampering with or circumventing an ignition interlock
 10  6 device.
 10  7    c.  The department of public safety, in consultation with the
 10  8 department, may adopt rules to administer this subsection.
 10  9    2.  a.  An ignition interlock indigent user fund is created
 10 10 in the state treasury. The fund shall be administered by
 10 11 the department and shall consist of moneys collected by the
 10 12 department under this subsection. The moneys in the fund are
 10 13 appropriated to and shall be used by the department to assist
 10 14 indigent users of ignition interlock devices in paying for the
 10 15 use of the devices. Notwithstanding section 8.33, moneys in
 10 16 the fund at the end of each fiscal year shall not revert to any
 10 17 other fund but shall remain in the fund for expenditure for
 10 18 subsequent fiscal years.
 10 19    b.  Each month, the department shall assess an ignition
 10 20 interlock user fee to each user of an ignition interlock
 10 21 device. All ignition interlock user fees shall be collected by
 10 22 the department and deposited in the ignition interlock indigent
 10 23 user fund. The amount of the monthly ignition interlock user
 10 24 fee shall be set by the department so that the moneys in the
 10 25 ignition interlock indigent user fund are sufficient to assist
 10 26 all indigent users of ignition interlock devices in paying for
 10 27 the use of the devices.
 10 28    c.  A person is indigent for the purposes of this subsection
 10 29 if any of the following apply:
 10 30    (1)  The person has an income level at or below one hundred
 10 31 twenty=five percent of the United States poverty level as
 10 32 defined by the most recently revised poverty income guidelines
 10 33 published by the United States department of health and human
 10 34 services, and the department determines that the person is
 10 35 unable to pay for the cost of an ignition interlock device. In
 11  1 making the determination of a person's ability to pay for the
 11  2 cost of a device, the department shall consider not only the
 11  3 person's income, but also the person's other assets, including
 11  4 but not limited to cash, stocks, bonds, and any other property.
 11  5    (2)  The person has an income level greater than one hundred
 11  6 twenty=five percent, but at or below two hundred percent, of
 11  7 the most recently revised poverty income guidelines published
 11  8 by the United States department of health and human services,
 11  9 and the department determines that paying for the ignition
 11 10 interlock device would cause the person substantial hardship.
 11 11 In determining whether substantial hardship would result, the
 11 12 department shall consider not only the person's income, but
 11 13 also the person's other assets, including but not limited to
 11 14 cash, stocks, bonds, and any other property.
 11 15    d.  The department shall adopt rules to administer this
 11 16 subsection, including but not limited to the manner used to
 11 17 determine the monthly ignition interlock user fee and the
 11 18 accepted form and manner in which a person may demonstrate
 11 19 indigency.
 11 20    Sec. 15.  SOBRIETY MONITORING PILOT PROGRAMS.
 11 21    1.  The department of public health, in collaboration
 11 22 with the department of corrections, the department of public
 11 23 safety, and the department of transportation, may approve an
 11 24 application from a county for a countywide sobriety monitoring
 11 25 pilot program that is available twenty=four hours per day,
 11 26 seven days per week, in an effort to reduce the number of
 11 27 crimes related to operating while intoxicated. One application
 11 28 shall be approved for a county with a population of two hundred
 11 29 thousand people or more, one application shall be approved
 11 30 for a county with a population of one hundred thousand people
 11 31 or more but less than two hundred thousand people, and one
 11 32 application shall be approved for a county with a population of
 11 33 less than one hundred thousand people.
 11 34    2.  A sobriety monitoring pilot program shall do all of the
 11 35 following:
 12  1    a.  Require a person who has been charged with, pled guilty
 12  2 to, or been convicted of a violation of section 321J.2 to
 12  3 abstain from all chemical substances for a period of time.
 12  4    b.  Require the person to be subject to testing to determine
 12  5 whether a chemical substance is present in the person's body
 12  6 in the following manner:
 12  7    (1)  At least twice per day at a central location where an
 12  8 immediate sanction can be applied.
 12  9    (2)  Where testing under subparagraph (1) is impractical, by
 12 10 continuous transdermal or electronic monitoring.
 12 11    c.  Apply sanctions when test results definitively, and
 12 12 without presumption, indicate the presence of chemical
 12 13 substances.
 12 14    d.  Require a person participating in the program to pay
 12 15 program costs, including costs of installation, monitoring, and
 12 16 deactivation of any testing devices.
 12 17    e.  Require the person to install an ignition interlock
 12 18 device of a type approved by the commissioner of public safety
 12 19 on all vehicles owned or operated by the person, and require
 12 20 the person to pay the costs associated with the installation
 12 21 and use of the ignition interlock device.
 12 22    3.  A court in a county that has established a pilot program
 12 23 pursuant to this section may order a defendant, as a condition
 12 24 of pretrial release, probation, or bond, to participate in the
 12 25 program.
 12 26    4.  An approved pilot program shall begin on January 15,
 12 27 2017, or upon the effective date of department rules, whichever
 12 28 is earlier, and shall be conducted for a minimum of one year.
 12 29    5.  The department of public health shall adopt rules
 12 30 pursuant to chapter 17A to implement this section including
 12 31 but not limited to provisions relating to applications for,
 12 32 approval of, costs of, and oversight of the pilot programs and
 12 33 reporting requirements for participating counties.
 12 34    6.  The department of public health shall submit a report on
 12 35 the results of the pilot programs and make recommendations to
 13  1 the general assembly by December 15, 2018.
 13  2    7.  For the purposes of this section, "chemical substance"
 13  3 means alcohol, wine, spirits, and beer as defined in section
 13  4 123.3 and controlled substances as defined in section 124.101.
 13  5                           EXPLANATION
 13  6 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
 13  7 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
 13  8    Current law requires a person guilty of operating while
 13  9 intoxicated (OWI) to install an ignition interlock device in
 13 10 the person's vehicle if the person seeks a temporary restricted
 13 11 license, unless the person's alcohol concentration was less
 13 12 than .10 and no accident occurred. This bill strikes that
 13 13 exception, and also requires a person guilty of OWI to install
 13 14 an ignition interlock device in the person's vehicle upon the
 13 15 revocation of the person's driver's license rather than upon
 13 16 the person's application for a temporary restricted license.
 13 17    Under current law, an ignition interlock device is required
 13 18 to be installed in a person's vehicle for the period of time
 13 19 for which the person's temporary restricted license is issued,
 13 20 and up to one additional year after license reinstatement if
 13 21 the person has two or more OWI revocations. The bill requires
 13 22 the permanent installation of an ignition interlock device with
 13 23 two exceptions. If the ignition interlock device was installed
 13 24 as a result of the person's first OWI offense or revocation and
 13 25 a test was obtained, the device shall be uninstalled 180 days
 13 26 after the person's license was revoked, the person last failed
 13 27 a test by the ignition interlock device, or the defendant last
 13 28 failed to maintain the device as required, whichever is latest.
 13 29 If the ignition interlock device was installed as a result of
 13 30 the person's first OWI offense or revocation and a test was
 13 31 refused, the device shall be uninstalled 180 days after the
 13 32 person's license revocation period is over, the person last
 13 33 failed a test by the ignition interlock device, or the person
 13 34 last failed to maintain the device as required, whichever is
 13 35 latest.
 14  1 The bill provides an ignition interlock device shall not
 14  2 be uninstalled if the person has been convicted of a second
 14  3 or subsequent OWI violation, if the person's license has been
 14  4 revoked for a second or subsequent time, or if the person has
 14  5 been convicted of tampering with or circumventing an ignition
 14  6 interlock device.
 14  7    The bill requires the department of transportation (DOT)
 14  8 to assess a monthly ignition interlock user fee to each user
 14  9 of an ignition interlock device. All ignition interlock user
 14 10 fees will be collected by the DOT and deposited in an ignition
 14 11 interlock indigent user fund (IIIUF). The bill requires the
 14 12 DOT to use the moneys in the IIIUF to assist indigent users
 14 13 of ignition interlock devices in paying for the use of the
 14 14 devices. The amount of the monthly ignition interlock user fee
 14 15 shall be set by the DOT so that the moneys in the IIIUF are
 14 16 sufficient to assist all indigent users of ignition interlock
 14 17 devices in paying for the use of the devices.
 14 18    Under the bill, a person is indigent if the person has an
 14 19 income level at or below 125 percent of the U.S. poverty level
 14 20 and the person is unable to pay for the cost of an ignition
 14 21 interlock device. A person is also indigent if the person has
 14 22 an income level greater than 125 percent, but at or below 200
 14 23 percent, of the U.S. poverty level and paying for the ignition
 14 24 interlock device would cause the person substantial hardship.
 14 25    The bill provides for county sobriety monitoring pilot
 14 26 programs. The bill allows the department of public health
 14 27 (DPH), in collaboration with the department of corrections,
 14 28 the department of public safety, and the DOT, to approve
 14 29 applications from counties for countywide sobriety monitoring
 14 30 pilot programs. The programs are to be available 24 hours per
 14 31 day, seven days per week, in an effort to reduce the number
 14 32 of crimes related to OWI.  One application shall be approved
 14 33 for a county with a population of 200,000 people or more, one
 14 34 application shall be approved for a county with a population of
 14 35 100,000 people or more but less than 200,000 people, and one
 15  1 application shall be approved for a county with a population of
 15  2 less than 100,000 people.
 15  3    The programs shall require individuals charged with or
 15  4 convicted of OWI to abstain from all chemical substances for
 15  5 a period of time. The programs are to require testing to
 15  6 determine whether a chemical substance is present at least
 15  7 twice per day at a central location where an immediate sanction
 15  8 can be applied or, where such testing is impractical, by
 15  9 continuous transdermal or electronic monitoring. The programs
 15 10 shall also apply sanctions when test results definitively
 15 11 indicate the presence of a chemical substance. The programs
 15 12 shall require participants to pay program costs and to install
 15 13 an ignition interlock device.
 15 14    A court in a county that has established a pilot program
 15 15 may order a defendant, as a condition of pretrial release,
 15 16 probation, or bond, to participate in the program. Approved
 15 17 pilot programs shall begin January 15, 2017, or upon the
 15 18 effective date of DPH rules, whichever is earlier, and shall
 15 19 be conducted for a minimum of one year. The DPH is to adopt
 15 20 rules to implement the programs, including but not limited to
 15 21 provisions relating to applications for, approval of, costs of,
 15 22 and oversight of the pilot programs and reporting requirements
 15 23 for participating counties. The DPH is directed to submit
 15 24 a report on the results of the pilot programs and make
 15 25 recommendations to the general assembly by December 15, 2018.

 14 28 the department of public safety, and the DOT, to approve
 14 29 applications from counties for countywide sobriety monitoring
 14 30 pilot programs. The programs are to be available 24 hours per
 14 31 day, seven days per week, in an effort to reduce the number
 14 32 of crimes related to OWI.  One application shall be approved
 14 33 for a county with a population of 200,000 people or more, one
 14 34 application shall be approved for a county with a population of
 14 35 100,000 people or more but less than 200,000 people, and one
 15  1 application shall be approved for a county with a population of
 15  2 less than 100,000 people.
 15  3    The programs shall require individuals charged with or
 15  4 convicted of OWI to abstain from all chemical substances for
 15  5 a period of time. The programs are to require testing to
 15  6 determine whether a chemical substance is present at least
 15  7 twice per day at a central location where an immediate sanction
 15  8 can be applied or, where such testing is impractical, by
 15  9 continuous transdermal or electronic monitoring. The programs
 15 10 shall also apply sanctions when test results definitively
 15 11 indicate the presence of a chemical substance. The programs
 15 12 shall require participants to pay program costs and to install
 15 13 an ignition interlock device.
 15 14    A court in a county that has established a pilot program
 15 15 may order a defendant, as a condition of pretrial release,
 15 16 probation, or bond, to participate in the program. Approved
 15 17 pilot programs shall begin January 15, 2017, or upon the
 15 18 effective date of DPH rules, whichever is earlier, and shall
 15 19 be conducted for a minimum of one year. The DPH is to adopt
 15 20 rules to implement the programs, including but not limited to
 15 21 provisions relating to applications for, approval of, costs of,
 15 22 and oversight of the pilot programs and reporting requirements
 15 23 for participating counties. The DPH is directed to submit
 15 24 a report on the results of the pilot programs and make
 15 25 recommendations to the general assembly by December 15, 2018.

 10  1 under this section if the defendant has been convicted of
 10  2 a second or subsequent violation of section 321J.2, if the
 10  3 defendant's license has been revoked for a second or subsequent
 10  4 time under this chapter, or if the defendant has been convicted
 10  5 of tampering with or circumventing an ignition interlock
 10  6 device.
 10  7    c.  The department of public safety, in consultation with the
 10  8 department, may adopt rules to administer this subsection.
 10  9    2.  a.  An ignition interlock indigent user fund is created
 10 10 in the state treasury. The fund shall be administered by
 10 11 the department and shall consist of moneys collected by the
 10 12 department under this subsection. The moneys in the fund are
 10 13 appropriated to and shall be used by the department to assist
 10 14 indigent users of ignition interlock devices in paying for the
 10 15 use of the devices. Notwithstanding section 8.33, moneys in
 10 16 the fund at the end of each fiscal year shall not revert to any
 10 17 other fund but shall remain in the fund for expenditure for
 10 18 subsequent fiscal years.
 10 19    b.  Each month, the department shall assess an ignition
 10 20 interlock user fee to each user of an ignition interlock
 10 21 device. All ignition interlock user fees shall be collected by
 10 22 the department and deposited in the ignition interlock indigent
 10 23 user fund. The amount of the monthly ignition interlock user
 10 24 fee shall be set by the department so that the moneys in the
 10 25 ignition interlock indigent user fund are sufficient to assist
 10 26 all indigent users of ignition interlock devices in paying for
 10 27 the use of the devices.
 10 28    c.  A person is indigent for the purposes of this subsection
 10 29 if any of the following apply:
 10 30    (1)  The person has an income level at or below one hundred
 10 31 twenty=five percent of the United States poverty level as
 10 32 defined by the most recently revised poverty income guidelines
 10 33 published by the United States department of health and human
 10 34 services, and the department determines that the person is
 10 35 unable to pay for the cost of an ignition interlock device. In
 11  1 making the determination of a person's ability to pay for the
 11  2 cost of a device, the department shall consider not only the
 11  3 person's income, but also the person's other assets, including
 11  4 but not limited to cash, stocks, bonds, and any other property.
 11  5    (2)  The person has an income level greater than one hundred
 11  6 twenty=five percent, but at or below two hundred percent, of
 11  7 the most recently revised poverty income guidelines published
 11  8 by the United States department of health and human services,
 11  9 and the department determines that paying for the ignition
 11 10 interlock device would cause the person substantial hardship.
 11 11 In determining whether substantial hardship would result, the
 11 12 department shall consider not only the person's income, but
 11 13 also the person's other assets, including but not limited to
 11 14 cash, stocks, bonds, and any other property.
 11 15    d.  The department shall adopt rules to administer this
 11 16 subsection, including but not limited to the manner used to
 11 17 determine the monthly ignition interlock user fee and the
 11 18 accepted form and manner in which a person may demonstrate
 11 19 indigency.
 11 20    Sec. 15.  SOBRIETY MONITORING PILOT PROGRAMS.
 11 21    1.  The department of public health, in collaboration
 11 22 with the department of corrections, the department of public
 11 23 safety, and the department of transportation, may approve an
 11 24 application from a county for a countywide sobriety monitoring
 11 25 pilot program that is available twenty=four hours per day,
 11 26 seven days per week, in an effort to reduce the number of
 11 27 crimes related to operating while intoxicated. One application
 11 28 shall be approved for a county with a population of two hundred
 11 29 thousand people or more, one application shall be approved
 11 30 for a county with a population of one hundred thousand people
 11 31 or more but less than two hundred thousand people, and one
 11 32 application shall be approved for a county with a population of
 11 33 less than one hundred thousand people.
 11 34    2.  A sobriety monitoring pilot program shall do all of the
 11 35 following:
 12  1    a.  Require a person who has been charged with, pled guilty
 12  2 to, or been convicted of a violation of section 321J.2 to
 12  3 abstain from all chemical substances for a period of time.
 12  4    b.  Require the person to be subject to testing to determine
 12  5 whether a chemical substance is present in the person's body
 12  6 in the following manner:
 12  7    (1)  At least twice per day at a central location where an
 12  8 immediate sanction can be applied.
 12  9    (2)  Where testing under subparagraph (1) is impractical, by
 12 10 continuous transdermal or electronic monitoring.
 12 11    c.  Apply sanctions when test results definitively, and
 12 12 without presumption, indicate the presence of chemical
 12 13 substances.
 12 14    d.  Require a person participating in the program to pay
 12 15 program costs, including costs of installation, monitoring, and
 12 16 deactivation of any testing devices.
 12 17    e.  Require the person to install an ignition interlock
 12 18 device of a type approved by the commissioner of public safety
 12 19 on all vehicles owned or operated by the person, and require
 12 20 the person to pay the costs associated with the installation
 12 21 and use of the ignition interlock device.
 12 22    3.  A court in a county that has established a pilot program
 12 23 pursuant to this section may order a defendant, as a condition
 12 24 of pretrial release, probation, or bond, to participate in the
 12 25 program.
 12 26    4.  An approved pilot program shall begin on January 15,
 12 27 2017, or upon the effective date of department rules, whichever
 12 28 is earlier, and shall be conducted for a minimum of one year.
 12 29    5.  The department of public health shall adopt rules
 12 30 pursuant to chapter 17A to implement this section including
 12 31 but not limited to provisions relating to applications for,
 12 32 approval of, costs of, and oversight of the pilot programs and
 12 33 reporting requirements for participating counties.
 12 34    6.  The department of public health shall submit a report on
 12 35 the results of the pilot programs and make recommendations to
 13  1 the general assembly by December 15, 2018.
 13  2    7.  For the purposes of this section, "chemical substance"
 13  3 means alcohol, wine, spirits, and beer as defined in section
 13  4 123.3 and controlled substances as defined in section 124.101.
 13  5                           EXPLANATION
 13  6 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
 13  7 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
 13  8    Current law requires a person guilty of operating while
 13  9 intoxicated (OWI) to install an ignition interlock device in
 13 10 the person's vehicle if the person seeks a temporary restricted
 13 11 license, unless the person's alcohol concentration was less
 13 12 than .10 and no accident occurred. This bill strikes that
 13 13 exception, and also requires a person guilty of OWI to install
 13 14 an ignition interlock device in the person's vehicle upon the
 13 15 revocation of the person's driver's license rather than upon
 13 16 the person's application for a temporary restricted license.
 13 17    Under current law, an ignition interlock device is required
 13 18 to be installed in a person's vehicle for the period of time
 13 19 for which the person's temporary restricted license is issued,
 13 20 and up to one additional year after license reinstatement if
 13 21 the person has two or more OWI revocations. The bill requires
 13 22 the permanent installation of an ignition interlock device with
 13 23 two exceptions. If the ignition interlock device was installed
 13 24 as a result of the person's first OWI offense or revocation and
 13 25 a test was obtained, the device shall be uninstalled 180 days
 13 26 after the person's license was revoked, the person last failed
 13 27 a test by the ignition interlock device, or the defendant last
 13 28 failed to maintain the device as required, whichever is latest.
 13 29 If the ignition interlock device was installed as a result of
 13 30 the person's first OWI offense or revocation and a test was
 13 31 refused, the device shall be uninstalled 180 days after the
 13 32 person's license revocation period is over, the person last
 13 33 failed a test by the ignition interlock device, or the person
 13 34 last failed to maintain the device as required, whichever is
 13 35 latest.
 14  1 The bill provides an ignition interlock device shall not
 14  2 be uninstalled if the person has been convicted of a second
 14  3 or subsequent OWI violation, if the person's license has been
 14  4 revoked for a second or subsequent time, or if the person has
 14  5 been convicted of tampering with or circumventing an ignition
 14  6 interlock device.
 14  7    The bill requires the department of transportation (DOT)
 14  8 to assess a monthly ignition interlock user fee to each user
 14  9 of an ignition interlock device. All ignition interlock user
 14 10 fees will be collected by the DOT and deposited in an ignition
 14 11 interlock indigent user fund (IIIUF). The bill requires the
 14 12 DOT to use the moneys in the IIIUF to assist indigent users
 14 13 of ignition interlock devices in paying for the use of the
 14 14 devices. The amount of the monthly ignition interlock user fee
 14 15 shall be set by the DOT so that the moneys in the IIIUF are
 14 16 sufficient to assist all indigent users of ignition interlock
 14 17 devices in paying for the use of the devices.
 14 18    Under the bill, a person is indigent if the person has an
 14 19 income level at or below 125 percent of the U.S. poverty level
 14 20 and the person is unable to pay for the cost of an ignition
 14 21 interlock device. A person is also indigent if the person has
 14 22 an income level greater than 125 percent, but at or below 200
 14 23 percent, of the U.S. poverty level and paying for the ignition
 14 24 interlock device would cause the person substantial hardship.
 14 25    The bill provides for county sobriety monitoring pilot
 14 26 programs. The bill allows the department of public health
 14 27 (DPH), in collaboration with the department of corrections,
 14 28 the department of public safety, and the DOT, to approve
 14 29 applications from counties for countywide sobriety monitoring
 14 30 pilot programs. The programs are to be available 24 hours per
 14 31 day, seven days per week, in an effort to reduce the number
 14 32 of crimes related to OWI.  One application shall be approved
 14 33 for a county with a population of 200,000 people or more, one
 14 34 application shall be approved for a county with a population of
 14 35 100,000 people or more but less than 200,000 people, and one
 15  1 application shall be approved for a county with a population of
 15  2 less than 100,000 people.
 15  3    The programs shall require individuals charged with or
 15  4 convicted of OWI to abstain from all chemical substances for
 15  5 a period of time. The programs are to require testing to
 15  6 determine whether a chemical substance is present at least
 15  7 twice per day at a central location where an immediate sanction
 15  8 can be applied or, where such testing is impractical, by
 15  9 continuous transdermal or electronic monitoring. The programs
 15 10 shall also apply sanctions when test results definitively
 15 11 indicate the presence of a chemical substance. The programs
 15 12 shall require participants to pay program costs and to install
 15 13 an ignition interlock device.
 15 14    A court in a county that has established a pilot program
 15 15 may order a defendant, as a condition of pretrial release,
 15 16 probation, or bond, to participate in the program. Approved
 15 17 pilot programs shall begin January 15, 2017, or upon the
 15 18 effective date of DPH rules, whichever is earlier, and shall
 15 19 be conducted for a minimum of one year. The DPH is to adopt
 15 20 rules to implement the programs, including but not limited to
 15 21 provisions relating to applications for, approval of, costs of,
 15 22 and oversight of the pilot programs and reporting requirements
 15 23 for participating counties. The DPH is directed to submit
 15 24 a report on the results of the pilot programs and make
 15 25 recommendations to the general assembly by December 15, 2018.

 11 20    Sec. 15.  SOBRIETY MONITORING PILOT PROGRAMS.
 11 21    1.  The department of public health, in collaboration
 11 22 with the department of corrections, the department of public
 11 23 safety, and the department of transportation, may approve an
 11 24 application from a county for a countywide sobriety monitoring

 13  1 the general assembly by December 15, 2018.
 13  2    7.  For the purposes of this section, "chemical substance"
 13  3 means alcohol, wine, spirits, and beer as defined in section
 13  4 123.3 and controlled substances as defined in section 124.101.
 13  5                           EXPLANATION
 13  6 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
 13  7 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
 13  8    Current law requires a person guilty of operating while
 13  9 intoxicated (OWI) to install an ignition interlock device in
 13 10 the person's vehicle if the person seeks a temporary restricted
 13 11 license, unless the person's alcohol concentration was less
 13 12 than .10 and no accident occurred. This bill strikes that
 13 13 exception, and also requires a person guilty of OWI to install
 13 14 an ignition interlock device in the person's vehicle upon the
 13 15 revocation of the person's driver's license rather than upon
 13 16 the person's application for a temporary restricted license.
 13 17    Under current law, an ignition interlock device is required
 13 18 to be installed in a person's vehicle for the period of time
 13 19 for which the person's temporary restricted license is issued,
 13 20 and up to one additional year after license reinstatement if
 13 21 the person has two or more OWI revocations. The bill requires
 13 22 the permanent installation of an ignition interlock device with
 13 23 two exceptions. If the ignition interlock device was installed
 13 24 as a result of the person's first OWI offense or revocation and
 13 25 a test was obtained, the device shall be uninstalled 180 days
 13 26 after the person's license was revoked, the person last failed
 13 27 a test by the ignition interlock device, or the defendant last
 13 28 failed to maintain the device as required, whichever is latest.
 13 29 If the ignition interlock device was installed as a result of
 13 30 the person's first OWI offense or revocation and a test was
 13 31 refused, the device shall be uninstalled 180 days after the
 13 32 person's license revocation period is over, the person last
 13 33 failed a test by the ignition interlock device, or the person
 13 34 last failed to maintain the device as required, whichever is
 13 35 latest.
 14  1 The bill provides an ignition interlock device shall not
 14  2 be uninstalled if the person has been convicted of a second
 14  3 or subsequent OWI violation, if the person's license has been
 14  4 revoked for a second or subsequent time, or if the person has
 14  5 been convicted of tampering with or circumventing an ignition
 14  6 interlock device.
 14  7    The bill requires the department of transportation (DOT)
 14  8 to assess a monthly ignition interlock user fee to each user
 14  9 of an ignition interlock device. All ignition interlock user
 14 10 fees will be collected by the DOT and deposited in an ignition
 14 11 interlock indigent user fund (IIIUF). The bill requires the
 14 12 DOT to use the moneys in the IIIUF to assist indigent users
 14 13 of ignition interlock devices in paying for the use of the
 14 14 devices. The amount of the monthly ignition interlock user fee
 14 15 shall be set by the DOT so that the moneys in the IIIUF are
 14 16 sufficient to assist all indigent users of ignition interlock
 14 17 devices in paying for the use of the devices.
 14 18    Under the bill, a person is indigent if the person has an
 14 19 income level at or below 125 percent of the U.S. poverty level
 14 20 and the person is unable to pay for the cost of an ignition
 14 21 interlock device. A person is also indigent if the person has
 14 22 an income level greater than 125 percent, but at or below 200
 14 23 percent, of the U.S. poverty level and paying for the ignition
 14 24 interlock device would cause the person substantial hardship.
 14 25    The bill provides for county sobriety monitoring pilot
 14 26 programs. The bill allows the department of public health
 14 27 (DPH), in collaboration with the department of corrections,
 14 28 the department of public safety, and the DOT, to approve
 14 29 applications from counties for countywide sobriety monitoring
 14 30 pilot programs. The programs are to be available 24 hours per
 14 31 day, seven days per week, in an effort to reduce the number
 14 32 of crimes related to OWI.  One application shall be approved
 14 33 for a county with a population of 200,000 people or more, one
 14 34 application shall be approved for a county with a population of
 14 35 100,000 people or more but less than 200,000 people, and one
 15  1 application shall be approved for a county with a population of
 15  2 less than 100,000 people.
 15  3    The programs shall require individuals charged with or
 15  4 convicted of OWI to abstain from all chemical substances for
 15  5 a period of time. The programs are to require testing to
 15  6 determine whether a chemical substance is present at least
 15  7 twice per day at a central location where an immediate sanction
 15  8 can be applied or, where such testing is impractical, by
 15  9 continuous transdermal or electronic monitoring. The programs
 15 10 shall also apply sanctions when test results definitively
 15 11 indicate the presence of a chemical substance. The programs
 15 12 shall require participants to pay program costs and to install
 15 13 an ignition interlock device.
 15 14    A court in a county that has established a pilot program
 15 15 may order a defendant, as a condition of pretrial release,
 15 16 probation, or bond, to participate in the program. Approved
 15 17 pilot programs shall begin January 15, 2017, or upon the
 15 18 effective date of DPH rules, whichever is earlier, and shall
 15 19 be conducted for a minimum of one year. The DPH is to adopt
 15 20 rules to implement the programs, including but not limited to
 15 21 provisions relating to applications for, approval of, costs of,
 15 22 and oversight of the pilot programs and reporting requirements
 15 23 for participating counties. The DPH is directed to submit
 15 24 a report on the results of the pilot programs and make
 15 25 recommendations to the general assembly by December 15, 2018.

 10  2 a second or subsequent violation of section 321J.2, if the
 10  3 defendant's license has been revoked for a second or subsequent
 10  4 time under this chapter, or if the defendant has been convicted
 10  5 of tampering with or circumventing an ignition interlock
 10  6 device.
 10  7    c.  The department of public safety, in consultation with the
 10  8 department, may adopt rules to administer this subsection.
 10  9    2.  a.  An ignition interlock indigent user fund is created
 10 10 in the state treasury. The fund shall be administered by
 10 11 the department and shall consist of moneys collected by the
 10 12 department under this subsection. The moneys in the fund are
 10 13 appropriated to and shall be used by the department to assist
 10 14 indigent users of ignition interlock devices in paying for the
 10 15 use of the devices. Notwithstanding section 8.33, moneys in
 10 16 the fund at the end of each fiscal year shall not revert to any
 10 17 other fund but shall remain in the fund for expenditure for
 10 18 subsequent fiscal years.
 10 19    b.  Each month, the department shall assess an ignition
 10 20 interlock user fee to each user of an ignition interlock
 10 21 device. All ignition interlock user fees shall be collected by
 10 22 the department and deposited in the ignition interlock indigent
 10 23 user fund. The amount of the monthly ignition interlock user
 10 24 fee shall be set by the department so that the moneys in the
 10 25 ignition interlock indigent user fund are sufficient to assist
 10 26 all indigent users of ignition interlock devices in paying for
 10 27 the use of the devices.
 10 28    c.  A person is indigent for the purposes of this subsection
 10 29 if any of the following apply:
 10 30    (1)  The person has an income level at or below one hundred
 10 31 twenty=five percent of the United States poverty level as
 10 32 defined by the most recently revised poverty income guidelines
 10 33 published by the United States department of health and human
 10 34 services, and the department determines that the person is
 10 35 unable to pay for the cost of an ignition interlock device. In
 11  1 making the determination of a person's ability to pay for the
 11  2 cost of a device, the department shall consider not only the
 11  3 person's income, but also the person's other assets, including
 11  4 but not limited to cash, stocks, bonds, and any other property.
 11  5    (2)  The person has an income level greater than one hundred
 11  6 twenty=five percent, but at or below two hundred percent, of
 11  7 the most recently revised poverty income guidelines published
 11  8 by the United States department of health and human services,
 11  9 and the department determines that paying for the ignition
 11 10 interlock device would cause the person substantial hardship.
 11 11 In determining whether substantial hardship would result, the
 11 12 department shall consider not only the person's income, but
 11 13 also the person's other assets, including but not limited to
 11 14 cash, stocks, bonds, and any other property.
 11 15    d.  The department shall adopt rules to administer this
 11 16 subsection, including but not limited to the manner used to
 11 17 determine the monthly ignition interlock user fee and the
 11 18 accepted form and manner in which a person may demonstrate
 11 19 indigency.
 11 20    Sec. 15.  SOBRIETY MONITORING PILOT PROGRAMS.
 11 21    1.  The department of public health, in collaboration
 11 22 with the department of corrections, the department of public
 11 23 safety, and the department of transportation, may approve an
 11 24 application from a county for a countywide sobriety monitoring
 11 25 pilot program that is available twenty=four hours per day,
 11 26 seven days per week, in an effort to reduce the number of
 11 27 crimes related to operating while intoxicated. One application
 11 28 shall be approved for a county with a population of two hundred
 11 29 thousand people or more, one application shall be approved
 11 30 for a county with a population of one hundred thousand people
 11 31 or more but less than two hundred thousand people, and one
 11 32 application shall be approved for a county with a population of
 11 33 less than one hundred thousand people.
 11 34    2.  A sobriety monitoring pilot program shall do all of the
 11 35 following:
 12  1    a.  Require a person who has been charged with, pled guilty
 12  2 to, or been convicted of a violation of section 321J.2 to
 12  3 abstain from all chemical substances for a period of time.
 12  4    b.  Require the person to be subject to testing to determine
 12  5 whether a chemical substance is present in the person's body
 12  6 in the following manner:
 12  7    (1)  At least twice per day at a central location where an
 12  8 immediate sanction can be applied.
 12  9    (2)  Where testing under subparagraph (1) is impractical, by
 12 10 continuous transdermal or electronic monitoring.
 12 11    c.  Apply sanctions when test results definitively, and
 12 12 without presumption, indicate the presence of chemical
 12 13 substances.
 12 14    d.  Require a person participating in the program to pay
 12 15 program costs, including costs of installation, monitoring, and
 12 16 deactivation of any testing devices.
 12 17    e.  Require the person to install an ignition interlock
 12 18 device of a type approved by the commissioner of public safety
 12 19 on all vehicles owned or operated by the person, and require
 12 20 the person to pay the costs associated with the installation
 12 21 and use of the ignition interlock device.
 12 22    3.  A court in a county that has established a pilot program
 12 23 pursuant to this section may order a defendant, as a condition
 12 24 of pretrial release, probation, or bond, to participate in the
 12 25 program.
 12 26    4.  An approved pilot program shall begin on January 15,
 12 27 2017, or upon the effective date of department rules, whichever
 12 28 is earlier, and shall be conducted for a minimum of one year.
 12 29    5.  The department of public health shall adopt rules
 12 30 pursuant to chapter 17A to implement this section including
 12 31 but not limited to provisions relating to applications for,
 12 32 approval of, costs of, and oversight of the pilot programs and
 12 33 reporting requirements for participating counties.
 12 34    6.  The department of public health shall submit a report on
 12 35 the results of the pilot programs and make recommendations to
 13  1 the general assembly by December 15, 2018.
 13  2    7.  For the purposes of this section, "chemical substance"
 13  3 means alcohol, wine, spirits, and beer as defined in section
 13  4 123.3 and controlled substances as defined in section 124.101.
 13  5                           EXPLANATION
 13  6 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
 13  7 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
 13  8    Current law requires a person guilty of operating while
 13  9 intoxicated (OWI) to install an ignition interlock device in
 13 10 the person's vehicle if the person seeks a temporary restricted
 13 11 license, unless the person's alcohol concentration was less
 13 12 than .10 and no accident occurred. This bill strikes that
 13 13 exception, and also requires a person guilty of OWI to install
 13 14 an ignition interlock device in the person's vehicle upon the
 13 15 revocation of the person's driver's license rather than upon
 13 16 the person's application for a temporary restricted license.
 13 17    Under current law, an ignition interlock device is required
 13 18 to be installed in a person's vehicle for the period of time
 13 19 for which the person's temporary restricted license is issued,
 13 20 and up to one additional year after license reinstatement if
 13 21 the person has two or more OWI revocations. The bill requires
 13 22 the permanent installation of an ignition interlock device with
 13 23 two exceptions. If the ignition interlock device was installed
 13 24 as a result of the person's first OWI offense or revocation and
 13 25 a test was obtained, the device shall be uninstalled 180 days
 13 26 after the person's license was revoked, the person last failed
 13 27 a test by the ignition interlock device, or the defendant last
 13 28 failed to maintain the device as required, whichever is latest.
 13 29 If the ignition interlock device was installed as a result of
 13 30 the person's first OWI offense or revocation and a test was
 13 31 refused, the device shall be uninstalled 180 days after the
 13 32 person's license revocation period is over, the person last
 13 33 failed a test by the ignition interlock device, or the person
 13 34 last failed to maintain the device as required, whichever is
 13 35 latest.
 14  1 The bill provides an ignition interlock device shall not
 14  2 be uninstalled if the person has been convicted of a second
 14  3 or subsequent OWI violation, if the person's license has been
 14  4 revoked for a second or subsequent time, or if the person has
 14  5 been convicted of tampering with or circumventing an ignition
 14  6 interlock device.
 14  7    The bill requires the department of transportation (DOT)
 14  8 to assess a monthly ignition interlock user fee to each user
 14  9 of an ignition interlock device. All ignition interlock user
 14 10 fees will be collected by the DOT and deposited in an ignition
 14 11 interlock indigent user fund (IIIUF). The bill requires the
 14 12 DOT to use the moneys in the IIIUF to assist indigent users
 14 13 of ignition interlock devices in paying for the use of the
 14 14 devices. The amount of the monthly ignition interlock user fee
 14 15 shall be set by the DOT so that the moneys in the IIIUF are
 14 16 sufficient to assist all indigent users of ignition interlock
 14 17 devices in paying for the use of the devices.
 14 18    Under the bill, a person is indigent if the person has an
 14 19 income level at or below 125 percent of the U.S. poverty level
 14 20 and the person is unable to pay for the cost of an ignition
 14 21 interlock device. A person is also indigent if the person has
 14 22 an income level greater than 125 percent, but at or below 200
 14 23 percent, of the U.S. poverty level and paying for the ignition
 14 24 interlock device would cause the person substantial hardship.
 14 25    The bill provides for county sobriety monitoring pilot
 14 26 programs. The bill allows the department of public health
 14 27 (DPH), in collaboration with the department of corrections,
 14 28 the department of public safety, and the DOT, to approve
 14 29 applications from counties for countywide sobriety monitoring
 14 30 pilot programs. The programs are to be available 24 hours per
 14 31 day, seven days per week, in an effort to reduce the number
 14 32 of crimes related to OWI.  One application shall be approved
 14 33 for a county with a population of 200,000 people or more, one
 14 34 application shall be approved for a county with a population of
 14 35 100,000 people or more but less than 200,000 people, and one
 15  1 application shall be approved for a county with a population of
 15  2 less than 100,000 people.
 15  3    The programs shall require individuals charged with or
 15  4 convicted of OWI to abstain from all chemical substances for
 15  5 a period of time. The programs are to require testing to
 15  6 determine whether a chemical substance is present at least
 15  7 twice per day at a central location where an immediate sanction
 15  8 can be applied or, where such testing is impractical, by
 15  9 continuous transdermal or electronic monitoring. The programs
 15 10 shall also apply sanctions when test results definitively
 15 11 indicate the presence of a chemical substance. The programs
 15 12 shall require participants to pay program costs and to install
 15 13 an ignition interlock device.
 15 14    A court in a county that has established a pilot program
 15 15 may order a defendant, as a condition of pretrial release,
 15 16 probation, or bond, to participate in the program. Approved
 15 17 pilot programs shall begin January 15, 2017, or upon the
 15 18 effective date of DPH rules, whichever is earlier, and shall
 15 19 be conducted for a minimum of one year. The DPH is to adopt
 15 20 rules to implement the programs, including but not limited to
 15 21 provisions relating to applications for, approval of, costs of,
 15 22 and oversight of the pilot programs and reporting requirements
 15 23 for participating counties. The DPH is directed to submit
 15 24 a report on the results of the pilot programs and make
 15 25 recommendations to the general assembly by December 15, 2018.

 13  4 123.3 and controlled substances as defined in section 124.101.
 13  5                           EXPLANATION
 13  6 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
 13  7 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
 13  8    Current law requires a person guilty of operating while
 13  9 intoxicated (OWI) to install an ignition interlock device in
 13 10 the person's vehicle if the person seeks a temporary restricted
 13 11 license, unless the person's alcohol concentration was less
 13 12 than .10 and no accident occurred. This bill strikes that
 13 13 exception, and also requires a person guilty of OWI to install
 13 14 an ignition interlock device in the person's vehicle upon the
 13 15 revocation of the person's driver's license rather than upon
 13 16 the person's application for a temporary restricted license.
 13 17    Under current law, an ignition interlock device is required
 13 18 to be installed in a person's vehicle for the period of time
 13 19 for which the person's temporary restricted license is issued,

 13 21 the person has two or more OWI revocations. The bill requires
 13 22 the permanent installation of an ignition interlock device with
 13 23 two exceptions. If the ignition interlock device was installed
 13 24 as a result of the person's first OWI offense or revocation and
 13 25 a test was obtained, the device shall be uninstalled 180 days
 13 26 after the person's license was revoked, the person last failed
 13 27 a test by the ignition interlock device, or the defendant last
 13 28 failed to maintain the device as required, whichever is latest.
 13 29 If the ignition interlock device was installed as a result of
 13 30 the person's first OWI offense or revocation and a test was
 13 31 refused, the device shall be uninstalled 180 days after the
 13 32 person's license revocation period is over, the person last
 13 33 failed a test by the ignition interlock device, or the person
 13 34 last failed to maintain the device as required, whichever is
 13 35 latest.
 14  1 The bill provides an ignition interlock device shall not
 14  2 be uninstalled if the person has been convicted of a second
 14  3 or subsequent OWI violation, if the person's license has been
 14  4 revoked for a second or subsequent time, or if the person has
 14  5 been convicted of tampering with or circumventing an ignition
 14  6 interlock device.
 14  7    The bill requires the department of transportation (DOT)
 14  8 to assess a monthly ignition interlock user fee to each user
 14  9 of an ignition interlock device. All ignition interlock user
 14 10 fees will be collected by the DOT and deposited in an ignition

 14 12 DOT to use the moneys in the IIIUF to assist indigent users
 14 13 of ignition interlock devices in paying for the use of the
 14 14 devices. The amount of the monthly ignition interlock user fee
 14 15 shall be set by the DOT so that the moneys in the IIIUF are
 14 16 sufficient to assist all indigent users of ignition interlock
 14 17 devices in paying for the use of the devices.
 14 18    Under the bill, a person is indigent if the person has an
 14 19 income level at or below 125 percent of the U.S. poverty level
 14 20 and the person is unable to pay for the cost of an ignition
 14 21 interlock device. A person is also indigent if the person has
 14 22 an income level greater than 125 percent, but at or below 200
 14 23 percent, of the U.S. poverty level and paying for the ignition
 14 24 interlock device would cause the person substantial hardship.
 14 25    The bill provides for county sobriety monitoring pilot
 14 26 programs. The bill allows the department of public health
 14 27 (DPH), in collaboration with the department of corrections,
 14 28 the department of public safety, and the DOT, to approve

 14 34 application shall be approved for a county with a population of
 14 35 100,000 people or more but less than 200,000 people, and one
 15  1 application shall be approved for a county with a population of
 15  2 less than 100,000 people.
 15  3    The programs shall require individuals charged with or
 15  4 convicted of OWI to abstain from all chemical substances for
 15  5 a period of time. The programs are to require testing to
 15  6 determine whether a chemical substance is present at least
 15  7 twice per day at a central location where an immediate sanction
 15  8 can be applied or, where such testing is impractical, by
 15  9 continuous transdermal or electronic monitoring. The programs
 15 10 shall also apply sanctions when test results definitively
 15 11 indicate the presence of a chemical substance. The programs
 15 12 shall require participants to pay program costs and to install
 15 13 an ignition interlock device.
 15 14    A court in a county that has established a pilot program
 15 15 may order a defendant, as a condition of pretrial release,
 15 16 probation, or bond, to participate in the program. Approved
 15 17 pilot programs shall begin January 15, 2017, or upon the
 15 18 effective date of DPH rules, whichever is earlier, and shall
 15 19 be conducted for a minimum of one year. The DPH is to adopt
 15 20 rules to implement the programs, including but not limited to
 15 21 provisions relating to applications for, approval of, costs of,
 15 22 and oversight of the pilot programs and reporting requirements
 15 23 for participating counties. The DPH is directed to submit
 15 24 a report on the results of the pilot programs and make
 15 25 recommendations to the general assembly by December 15, 2018.

 10  4 time under this chapter, or if the defendant has been convicted
 10  5 of tampering with or circumventing an ignition interlock
 10  6 device.
 10  7    c.  The department of public safety, in consultation with the
 10  8 department, may adopt rules to administer this subsection.
 10  9    2.  a.  An ignition interlock indigent user fund is created
 10 10 in the state treasury. The fund shall be administered by
 10 11 the department and shall consist of moneys collected by the
 10 12 department under this subsection. The moneys in the fund are
 10 13 appropriated to and shall be used by the department to assist
 10 14 indigent users of ignition interlock devices in paying for the
 10 15 use of the devices. Notwithstanding section 8.33, moneys in
 10 16 the fund at the end of each fiscal year shall not revert to any
 10 17 other fund but shall remain in the fund for expenditure for
 10 18 subsequent fiscal years.
 10 19    b.  Each month, the department shall assess an ignition
 10 20 interlock user fee to each user of an ignition interlock
 10 21 device. All ignition interlock user fees shall be collected by
 10 22 the department and deposited in the ignition interlock indigent
 10 23 user fund. The amount of the monthly ignition interlock user
 10 24 fee shall be set by the department so that the moneys in the
 10 25 ignition interlock indigent user fund are sufficient to assist
 10 26 all indigent users of ignition interlock devices in paying for
 10 27 the use of the devices.
 10 28    c.  A person is indigent for the purposes of this subsection
 10 29 if any of the following apply:
 10 30    (1)  The person has an income level at or below one hundred
 10 31 twenty=five percent of the United States poverty level as
 10 32 defined by the most recently revised poverty income guidelines
 10 33 published by the United States department of health and human
 10 34 services, and the department determines that the person is
 10 35 unable to pay for the cost of an ignition interlock device. In
 11  1 making the determination of a person's ability to pay for the
 11  2 cost of a device, the department shall consider not only the
 11  3 person's income, but also the person's other assets, including
 11  4 but not limited to cash, stocks, bonds, and any other property.
 11  5    (2)  The person has an income level greater than one hundred
 11  6 twenty=five percent, but at or below two hundred percent, of
 11  7 the most recently revised poverty income guidelines published
 11  8 by the United States department of health and human services,
 11  9 and the department determines that paying for the ignition
 11 10 interlock device would cause the person substantial hardship.
 11 11 In determining whether substantial hardship would result, the
 11 12 department shall consider not only the person's income, but
 11 13 also the person's other assets, including but not limited to
 11 14 cash, stocks, bonds, and any other property.
 11 15    d.  The department shall adopt rules to administer this
 11 16 subsection, including but not limited to the manner used to
 11 17 determine the monthly ignition interlock user fee and the
 11 18 accepted form and manner in which a person may demonstrate
 11 19 indigency.
 11 20    Sec. 15.  SOBRIETY MONITORING PILOT PROGRAMS.
 11 21    1.  The department of public health, in collaboration
 11 22 with the department of corrections, the department of public
 11 23 safety, and the department of transportation, may approve an
 11 24 application from a county for a countywide sobriety monitoring
 11 25 pilot program that is available twenty=four hours per day,
 11 26 seven days per week, in an effort to reduce the number of
 11 27 crimes related to operating while intoxicated. One application
 11 28 shall be approved for a county with a population of two hundred
 11 29 thousand people or more, one application shall be approved
 11 30 for a county with a population of one hundred thousand people
 11 31 or more but less than two hundred thousand people, and one
 11 32 application shall be approved for a county with a population of
 11 33 less than one hundred thousand people.
 11 34    2.  A sobriety monitoring pilot program shall do all of the
 11 35 following:
 12  1    a.  Require a person who has been charged with, pled guilty
 12  2 to, or been convicted of a violation of section 321J.2 to
 12  3 abstain from all chemical substances for a period of time.
 12  4    b.  Require the person to be subject to testing to determine
 12  5 whether a chemical substance is present in the person's body
 12  6 in the following manner:
 12  7    (1)  At least twice per day at a central location where an
 12  8 immediate sanction can be applied.
 12  9    (2)  Where testing under subparagraph (1) is impractical, by
 12 10 continuous transdermal or electronic monitoring.
 12 11    c.  Apply sanctions when test results definitively, and
 12 12 without presumption, indicate the presence of chemical
 12 13 substances.
 12 14    d.  Require a person participating in the program to pay
 12 15 program costs, including costs of installation, monitoring, and
 12 16 deactivation of any testing devices.
 12 17    e.  Require the person to install an ignition interlock
 12 18 device of a type approved by the commissioner of public safety
 12 19 on all vehicles owned or operated by the person, and require
 12 20 the person to pay the costs associated with the installation
 12 21 and use of the ignition interlock device.
 12 22    3.  A court in a county that has established a pilot program
 12 23 pursuant to this section may order a defendant, as a condition
 12 24 of pretrial release, probation, or bond, to participate in the
 12 25 program.
 12 26    4.  An approved pilot program shall begin on January 15,
 12 27 2017, or upon the effective date of department rules, whichever
 12 28 is earlier, and shall be conducted for a minimum of one year.
 12 29    5.  The department of public health shall adopt rules
 12 30 pursuant to chapter 17A to implement this section including
 12 31 but not limited to provisions relating to applications for,
 12 32 approval of, costs of, and oversight of the pilot programs and
 12 33 reporting requirements for participating counties.
 12 34    6.  The department of public health shall submit a report on
 12 35 the results of the pilot programs and make recommendations to
 13  1 the general assembly by December 15, 2018.
 13  2    7.  For the purposes of this section, "chemical substance"
 13  3 means alcohol, wine, spirits, and beer as defined in section
 13  4 123.3 and controlled substances as defined in section 124.101.
 13  5                           EXPLANATION
 13  6 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
 13  7 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
 13  8    Current law requires a person guilty of operating while
 13  9 intoxicated (OWI) to install an ignition interlock device in
 13 10 the person's vehicle if the person seeks a temporary restricted
 13 11 license, unless the person's alcohol concentration was less
 13 12 than .10 and no accident occurred. This bill strikes that
 13 13 exception, and also requires a person guilty of OWI to install
 13 14 an ignition interlock device in the person's vehicle upon the
 13 15 revocation of the person's driver's license rather than upon
 13 16 the person's application for a temporary restricted license.
 13 17    Under current law, an ignition interlock device is required
 13 18 to be installed in a person's vehicle for the period of time
 13 19 for which the person's temporary restricted license is issued,
 13 20 and up to one additional year after license reinstatement if
 13 21 the person has two or more OWI revocations. The bill requires
 13 22 the permanent installation of an ignition interlock device with
 13 23 two exceptions. If the ignition interlock device was installed
 13 24 as a result of the person's first OWI offense or revocation and
 13 25 a test was obtained, the device shall be uninstalled 180 days
 13 26 after the person's license was revoked, the person last failed
 13 27 a test by the ignition interlock device, or the defendant last
 13 28 failed to maintain the device as required, whichever is latest.
 13 29 If the ignition interlock device was installed as a result of
 13 30 the person's first OWI offense or revocation and a test was
 13 31 refused, the device shall be uninstalled 180 days after the
 13 32 person's license revocation period is over, the person last
 13 33 failed a test by the ignition interlock device, or the person
 13 34 last failed to maintain the device as required, whichever is
 13 35 latest.
 14  1 The bill provides an ignition interlock device shall not
 14  2 be uninstalled if the person has been convicted of a second
 14  3 or subsequent OWI violation, if the person's license has been
 14  4 revoked for a second or subsequent time, or if the person has
 14  5 been convicted of tampering with or circumventing an ignition
 14  6 interlock device.
 14  7    The bill requires the department of transportation (DOT)
 14  8 to assess a monthly ignition interlock user fee to each user
 14  9 of an ignition interlock device. All ignition interlock user
 14 10 fees will be collected by the DOT and deposited in an ignition
 14 11 interlock indigent user fund (IIIUF). The bill requires the
 14 12 DOT to use the moneys in the IIIUF to assist indigent users
 14 13 of ignition interlock devices in paying for the use of the
 14 14 devices. The amount of the monthly ignition interlock user fee
 14 15 shall be set by the DOT so that the moneys in the IIIUF are
 14 16 sufficient to assist all indigent users of ignition interlock
 14 17 devices in paying for the use of the devices.
 14 18    Under the bill, a person is indigent if the person has an
 14 19 income level at or below 125 percent of the U.S. poverty level
 14 20 and the person is unable to pay for the cost of an ignition
 14 21 interlock device. A person is also indigent if the person has
 14 22 an income level greater than 125 percent, but at or below 200
 14 23 percent, of the U.S. poverty level and paying for the ignition
 14 24 interlock device would cause the person substantial hardship.
 14 25    The bill provides for county sobriety monitoring pilot
 14 26 programs. The bill allows the department of public health
 14 27 (DPH), in collaboration with the department of corrections,
 14 28 the department of public safety, and the DOT, to approve
 14 29 applications from counties for countywide sobriety monitoring
 14 30 pilot programs. The programs are to be available 24 hours per
 14 31 day, seven days per week, in an effort to reduce the number
 14 32 of crimes related to OWI.  One application shall be approved
 14 33 for a county with a population of 200,000 people or more, one
 14 34 application shall be approved for a county with a population of
 14 35 100,000 people or more but less than 200,000 people, and one
 15  1 application shall be approved for a county with a population of
 15  2 less than 100,000 people.
 15  3    The programs shall require individuals charged with or
 15  4 convicted of OWI to abstain from all chemical substances for
 15  5 a period of time. The programs are to require testing to
 15  6 determine whether a chemical substance is present at least
 15  7 twice per day at a central location where an immediate sanction
 15  8 can be applied or, where such testing is impractical, by
 15  9 continuous transdermal or electronic monitoring. The programs
 15 10 shall also apply sanctions when test results definitively
 15 11 indicate the presence of a chemical substance. The programs
 15 12 shall require participants to pay program costs and to install
 15 13 an ignition interlock device.
 15 14    A court in a county that has established a pilot program
 15 15 may order a defendant, as a condition of pretrial release,
 15 16 probation, or bond, to participate in the program. Approved
 15 17 pilot programs shall begin January 15, 2017, or upon the
 15 18 effective date of DPH rules, whichever is earlier, and shall
 15 19 be conducted for a minimum of one year. The DPH is to adopt
 15 20 rules to implement the programs, including but not limited to
 15 21 provisions relating to applications for, approval of, costs of,
 15 22 and oversight of the pilot programs and reporting requirements
 15 23 for participating counties. The DPH is directed to submit
 15 24 a report on the results of the pilot programs and make
 15 25 recommendations to the general assembly by December 15, 2018.

 10  7    c.  The department of public safety, in consultation with the
 10  8 department, may adopt rules to administer this subsection.
 10  9    2.  a.  An ignition interlock indigent user fund is created
 10 10 in the state treasury. The fund shall be administered by
 10 11 the department and shall consist of moneys collected by the
 10 12 department under this subsection. The moneys in the fund are

 10 14 indigent users of ignition interlock devices in paying for the
 10 15 use of the devices. Notwithstanding section 8.33, moneys in
 10 16 the fund at the end of each fiscal year shall not revert to any
 10 17 other fund but shall remain in the fund for expenditure for
 10 18 subsequent fiscal years.
 10 19    b.  Each month, the department shall assess an ignition
 10 20 interlock user fee to each user of an ignition interlock
 10 21 device. All ignition interlock user fees shall be collected by
 10 22 the department and deposited in the ignition interlock indigent
 10 23 user fund. The amount of the monthly ignition interlock user
 10 24 fee shall be set by the department so that the moneys in the
 10 25 ignition interlock indigent user fund are sufficient to assist
 10 26 all indigent users of ignition interlock devices in paying for
 10 27 the use of the devices.
 10 28    c.  A person is indigent for the purposes of this subsection
 10 29 if any of the following apply:
 10 30    (1)  The person has an income level at or below one hundred
 10 31 twenty=five percent of the United States poverty level as
 10 32 defined by the most recently revised poverty income guidelines
 10 33 published by the United States department of health and human
 10 34 services, and the department determines that the person is
 10 35 unable to pay for the cost of an ignition interlock device. In
 11  1 making the determination of a person's ability to pay for the
 11  2 cost of a device, the department shall consider not only the
 11  3 person's income, but also the person's other assets, including
 11  4 but not limited to cash, stocks, bonds, and any other property.
 11  5    (2)  The person has an income level greater than one hundred
 11  6 twenty=five percent, but at or below two hundred percent, of
 11  7 the most recently revised poverty income guidelines published
 11  8 by the United States department of health and human services,
 11  9 and the department determines that paying for the ignition
 11 10 interlock device would cause the person substantial hardship.
 11 11 In determining whether substantial hardship would result, the
 11 12 department shall consider not only the person's income, but
 11 13 also the person's other assets, including but not limited to
 11 14 cash, stocks, bonds, and any other property.
 11 15    d.  The department shall adopt rules to administer this

 11 20    Sec. 15.  SOBRIETY MONITORING PILOT PROGRAMS.
 11 21    1.  The department of public health, in collaboration
 11 22 with the department of corrections, the department of public
 11 23 safety, and the department of transportation, may approve an
 11 24 application from a county for a countywide sobriety monitoring
 11 25 pilot program that is available twenty=four hours per day,
 11 26 seven days per week, in an effort to reduce the number of
 11 27 crimes related to operating while intoxicated. One application
 11 28 shall be approved for a county with a population of two hundred
 11 29 thousand people or more, one application shall be approved
 11 30 for a county with a population of one hundred thousand people
 11 31 or more but less than two hundred thousand people, and one
 11 32 application shall be approved for a county with a population of
 11 33 less than one hundred thousand people.
 11 34    2.  A sobriety monitoring pilot program shall do all of the
 11 35 following:
 12  1    a.  Require a person who has been charged with, pled guilty
 12  2 to, or been convicted of a violation of section 321J.2 to
 12  3 abstain from all chemical substances for a period of time.
 12  4    b.  Require the person to be subject to testing to determine
 12  5 whether a chemical substance is present in the person's body
 12  6 in the following manner:
 12  7    (1)  At least twice per day at a central location where an
 12  8 immediate sanction can be applied.
 12  9    (2)  Where testing under subparagraph (1) is impractical, by
 12 10 continuous transdermal or electronic monitoring.
 12 11    c.  Apply sanctions when test results definitively, and
 12 12 without presumption, indicate the presence of chemical
 12 13 substances.
 12 14    d.  Require a person participating in the program to pay
 12 15 program costs, including costs of installation, monitoring, and
 12 16 deactivation of any testing devices.
 12 17    e.  Require the person to install an ignition interlock
 12 18 device of a type approved by the commissioner of public safety
 12 19 on all vehicles owned or operated by the person, and require
 12 20 the person to pay the costs associated with the installation
 12 21 and use of the ignition interlock device.
 12 22    3.  A court in a county that has established a pilot program
 12 23 pursuant to this section may order a defendant, as a condition
 12 24 of pretrial release, probation, or bond, to participate in the
 12 25 program.
 12 26    4.  An approved pilot program shall begin on January 15,
 12 27 2017, or upon the effective date of department rules, whichever
 12 28 is earlier, and shall be conducted for a minimum of one year.
 12 29    5.  The department of public health shall adopt rules
 12 30 pursuant to chapter 17A to implement this section including
 12 31 but not limited to provisions relating to applications for,
 12 32 approval of, costs of, and oversight of the pilot programs and
 12 33 reporting requirements for participating counties.
 12 34    6.  The department of public health shall submit a report on
 12 35 the results of the pilot programs and make recommendations to
 13  1 the general assembly by December 15, 2018.
 13  2    7.  For the purposes of this section, "chemical substance"
 13  3 means alcohol, wine, spirits, and beer as defined in section
 13  4 123.3 and controlled substances as defined in section 124.101.
 13  5                           EXPLANATION
 13  6 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
 13  7 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
 13  8    Current law requires a person guilty of operating while
 13  9 intoxicated (OWI) to install an ignition interlock device in
 13 10 the person's vehicle if the person seeks a temporary restricted
 13 11 license, unless the person's alcohol concentration was less
 13 12 than .10 and no accident occurred. This bill strikes that
 13 13 exception, and also requires a person guilty of OWI to install
 13 14 an ignition interlock device in the person's vehicle upon the
 13 15 revocation of the person's driver's license rather than upon
 13 16 the person's application for a temporary restricted license.
 13 17    Under current law, an ignition interlock device is required
 13 18 to be installed in a person's vehicle for the period of time
 13 19 for which the person's temporary restricted license is issued,
 13 20 and up to one additional year after license reinstatement if
 13 21 the person has two or more OWI revocations. The bill requires
 13 22 the permanent installation of an ignition interlock device with
 13 23 two exceptions. If the ignition interlock device was installed
 13 24 as a result of the person's first OWI offense or revocation and
 13 25 a test was obtained, the device shall be uninstalled 180 days
 13 26 after the person's license was revoked, the person last failed
 13 27 a test by the ignition interlock device, or the defendant last
 13 28 failed to maintain the device as required, whichever is latest.
 13 29 If the ignition interlock device was installed as a result of
 13 30 the person's first OWI offense or revocation and a test was
 13 31 refused, the device shall be uninstalled 180 days after the
 13 32 person's license revocation period is over, the person last
 13 33 failed a test by the ignition interlock device, or the person
 13 34 last failed to maintain the device as required, whichever is
 13 35 latest.
 14  1 The bill provides an ignition interlock device shall not
 14  2 be uninstalled if the person has been convicted of a second
 14  3 or subsequent OWI violation, if the person's license has been
 14  4 revoked for a second or subsequent time, or if the person has
 14  5 been convicted of tampering with or circumventing an ignition
 14  6 interlock device.
 14  7    The bill requires the department of transportation (DOT)
 14  8 to assess a monthly ignition interlock user fee to each user
 14  9 of an ignition interlock device. All ignition interlock user
 14 10 fees will be collected by the DOT and deposited in an ignition
 14 11 interlock indigent user fund (IIIUF). The bill requires the
 14 12 DOT to use the moneys in the IIIUF to assist indigent users
 14 13 of ignition interlock devices in paying for the use of the
 14 14 devices. The amount of the monthly ignition interlock user fee
 14 15 shall be set by the DOT so that the moneys in the IIIUF are
 14 16 sufficient to assist all indigent users of ignition interlock
 14 17 devices in paying for the use of the devices.
 14 18    Under the bill, a person is indigent if the person has an
 14 19 income level at or below 125 percent of the U.S. poverty level
 14 20 and the person is unable to pay for the cost of an ignition
 14 21 interlock device. A person is also indigent if the person has
 14 22 an income level greater than 125 percent, but at or below 200
 14 23 percent, of the U.S. poverty level and paying for the ignition
 14 24 interlock device would cause the person substantial hardship.
 14 25    The bill provides for county sobriety monitoring pilot
 14 26 programs. The bill allows the department of public health
 14 27 (DPH), in collaboration with the department of corrections,
 14 28 the department of public safety, and the DOT, to approve
 14 29 applications from counties for countywide sobriety monitoring
 14 30 pilot programs. The programs are to be available 24 hours per
 14 31 day, seven days per week, in an effort to reduce the number
 14 32 of crimes related to OWI.  One application shall be approved
 14 33 for a county with a population of 200,000 people or more, one
 14 34 application shall be approved for a county with a population of
 14 35 100,000 people or more but less than 200,000 people, and one
 15  1 application shall be approved for a county with a population of
 15  2 less than 100,000 people.
 15  3    The programs shall require individuals charged with or
 15  4 convicted of OWI to abstain from all chemical substances for
 15  5 a period of time. The programs are to require testing to
 15  6 determine whether a chemical substance is present at least
 15  7 twice per day at a central location where an immediate sanction
 15  8 can be applied or, where such testing is impractical, by
 15  9 continuous transdermal or electronic monitoring. The programs
 15 10 shall also apply sanctions when test results definitively
 15 11 indicate the presence of a chemical substance. The programs
 15 12 shall require participants to pay program costs and to install
 15 13 an ignition interlock device.
 15 14    A court in a county that has established a pilot program
 15 15 may order a defendant, as a condition of pretrial release,
 15 16 probation, or bond, to participate in the program. Approved
 15 17 pilot programs shall begin January 15, 2017, or upon the
 15 18 effective date of DPH rules, whichever is earlier, and shall
 15 19 be conducted for a minimum of one year. The DPH is to adopt
 15 20 rules to implement the programs, including but not limited to
 15 21 provisions relating to applications for, approval of, costs of,
 15 22 and oversight of the pilot programs and reporting requirements
 15 23 for participating counties. The DPH is directed to submit
 15 24 a report on the results of the pilot programs and make
 15 25 recommendations to the general assembly by December 15, 2018.

 10  7    c.  The department of public safety, in consultation with the
 10  8 department, may adopt rules to administer this subsection.
 10  9    2.  a.  An ignition interlock indigent user fund is created
 10 10 in the state treasury. The fund shall be administered by
 10 11 the department and shall consist of moneys collected by the
 10 12 department under this subsection. The moneys in the fund are
 10 13 appropriated to and shall be used by the department to assist
 10 14 indigent users of ignition interlock devices in paying for the
 10 15 use of the devices. Notwithstanding section 8.33, moneys in
 10 16 the fund at the end of each fiscal year shall not revert to any
 10 17 other fund but shall remain in the fund for expenditure for
 10 18 subsequent fiscal years.
 10 19    b.  Each month, the department shall assess an ignition
 10 20 interlock user fee to each user of an ignition interlock
 10 21 device. All ignition interlock user fees shall be collected by
 10 22 the department and deposited in the ignition interlock indigent
 10 23 user fund. The amount of the monthly ignition interlock user
 10 24 fee shall be set by the department so that the moneys in the
 10 25 ignition interlock indigent user fund are sufficient to assist
 10 26 all indigent users of ignition interlock devices in paying for
 10 27 the use of the devices.
 10 28    c.  A person is indigent for the purposes of this subsection
 10 29 if any of the following apply:
 10 30    (1)  The person has an income level at or below one hundred
 10 31 twenty=five percent of the United States poverty level as
 10 32 defined by the most recently revised poverty income guidelines
 10 33 published by the United States department of health and human
 10 34 services, and the department determines that the person is
 10 35 unable to pay for the cost of an ignition interlock device. In
 11  1 making the determination of a person's ability to pay for the
 11  2 cost of a device, the department shall consider not only the
 11  3 person's income, but also the person's other assets, including
 11  4 but not limited to cash, stocks, bonds, and any other property.
 11  5    (2)  The person has an income level greater than one hundred
 11  6 twenty=five percent, but at or below two hundred percent, of
 11  7 the most recently revised poverty income guidelines published
 11  8 by the United States department of health and human services,
 11  9 and the department determines that paying for the ignition
 11 10 interlock device would cause the person substantial hardship.
 11 11 In determining whether substantial hardship would result, the
 11 12 department shall consider not only the person's income, but
 11 13 also the person's other assets, including but not limited to
 11 14 cash, stocks, bonds, and any other property.
 11 15    d.  The department shall adopt rules to administer this
 11 16 subsection, including but not limited to the manner used to
 11 17 determine the monthly ignition interlock user fee and the
 11 18 accepted form and manner in which a person may demonstrate
 11 19 indigency.
 11 20    Sec. 15.  SOBRIETY MONITORING PILOT PROGRAMS.
 11 21    1.  The department of public health, in collaboration
 11 22 with the department of corrections, the department of public
 11 23 safety, and the department of transportation, may approve an
 11 24 application from a county for a countywide sobriety monitoring
 11 25 pilot program that is available twenty=four hours per day,
 11 26 seven days per week, in an effort to reduce the number of
 11 27 crimes related to operating while intoxicated. One application
 11 28 shall be approved for a county with a population of two hundred
 11 29 thousand people or more, one application shall be approved
 11 30 for a county with a population of one hundred thousand people
 11 31 or more but less than two hundred thousand people, and one
 11 32 application shall be approved for a county with a population of
 11 33 less than one hundred thousand people.
 11 34    2.  A sobriety monitoring pilot program shall do all of the
 11 35 following:
 12  1    a.  Require a person who has been charged with, pled guilty
 12  2 to, or been convicted of a violation of section 321J.2 to
 12  3 abstain from all chemical substances for a period of time.
 12  4    b.  Require the person to be subject to testing to determine
 12  5 whether a chemical substance is present in the person's body
 12  6 in the following manner:
 12  7    (1)  At least twice per day at a central location where an
 12  8 immediate sanction can be applied.
 12  9    (2)  Where testing under subparagraph (1) is impractical, by
 12 10 continuous transdermal or electronic monitoring.
 12 11    c.  Apply sanctions when test results definitively, and
 12 12 without presumption, indicate the presence of chemical
 12 13 substances.
 12 14    d.  Require a person participating in the program to pay
 12 15 program costs, including costs of installation, monitoring, and
 12 16 deactivation of any testing devices.
 12 17    e.  Require the person to install an ignition interlock
 12 18 device of a type approved by the commissioner of public safety
 12 19 on all vehicles owned or operated by the person, and require
 12 20 the person to pay the costs associated with the installation
 12 21 and use of the ignition interlock device.
 12 22    3.  A court in a county that has established a pilot program
 12 23 pursuant to this section may order a defendant, as a condition
 12 24 of pretrial release, probation, or bond, to participate in the
 12 25 program.
 12 26    4.  An approved pilot program shall begin on January 15,
 12 27 2017, or upon the effective date of department rules, whichever
 12 28 is earlier, and shall be conducted for a minimum of one year.
 12 29    5.  The department of public health shall adopt rules
 12 30 pursuant to chapter 17A to implement this section including
 12 31 but not limited to provisions relating to applications for,
 12 32 approval of, costs of, and oversight of the pilot programs and
 12 33 reporting requirements for participating counties.
 12 34    6.  The department of public health shall submit a report on
 12 35 the results of the pilot programs and make recommendations to
 13  1 the general assembly by December 15, 2018.
 13  2    7.  For the purposes of this section, "chemical substance"
 13  3 means alcohol, wine, spirits, and beer as defined in section
 13  4 123.3 and controlled substances as defined in section 124.101.
 13  5                           EXPLANATION
 13  6 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
 13  7 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
 13  8    Current law requires a person guilty of operating while
 13  9 intoxicated (OWI) to install an ignition interlock device in
 13 10 the person's vehicle if the person seeks a temporary restricted
 13 11 license, unless the person's alcohol concentration was less
 13 12 than .10 and no accident occurred. This bill strikes that
 13 13 exception, and also requires a person guilty of OWI to install
 13 14 an ignition interlock device in the person's vehicle upon the
 13 15 revocation of the person's driver's license rather than upon
 13 16 the person's application for a temporary restricted license.
 13 17    Under current law, an ignition interlock device is required
 13 18 to be installed in a person's vehicle for the period of time
 13 19 for which the person's temporary restricted license is issued,
 13 20 and up to one additional year after license reinstatement if
 13 21 the person has two or more OWI revocations. The bill requires
 13 22 the permanent installation of an ignition interlock device with
 13 23 two exceptions. If the ignition interlock device was installed
 13 24 as a result of the person's first OWI offense or revocation and
 13 25 a test was obtained, the device shall be uninstalled 180 days
 13 26 after the person's license was revoked, the person last failed
 13 27 a test by the ignition interlock device, or the defendant last
 13 28 failed to maintain the device as required, whichever is latest.
 13 29 If the ignition interlock device was installed as a result of
 13 30 the person's first OWI offense or revocation and a test was
 13 31 refused, the device shall be uninstalled 180 days after the
 13 32 person's license revocation period is over, the person last
 13 33 failed a test by the ignition interlock device, or the person
 13 34 last failed to maintain the device as required, whichever is
 13 35 latest.
 14  1 The bill provides an ignition interlock device shall not
 14  2 be uninstalled if the person has been convicted of a second
 14  3 or subsequent OWI violation, if the person's license has been
 14  4 revoked for a second or subsequent time, or if the person has
 14  5 been convicted of tampering with or circumventing an ignition
 14  6 interlock device.
 14  7    The bill requires the department of transportation (DOT)
 14  8 to assess a monthly ignition interlock user fee to each user
 14  9 of an ignition interlock device. All ignition interlock user
 14 10 fees will be collected by the DOT and deposited in an ignition
 14 11 interlock indigent user fund (IIIUF). The bill requires the
 14 12 DOT to use the moneys in the IIIUF to assist indigent users
 14 13 of ignition interlock devices in paying for the use of the
 14 14 devices. The amount of the monthly ignition interlock user fee
 14 15 shall be set by the DOT so that the moneys in the IIIUF are
 14 16 sufficient to assist all indigent users of ignition interlock
 14 17 devices in paying for the use of the devices.
 14 18    Under the bill, a person is indigent if the person has an
 14 19 income level at or below 125 percent of the U.S. poverty level
 14 20 and the person is unable to pay for the cost of an ignition
 14 21 interlock device. A person is also indigent if the person has
 14 22 an income level greater than 125 percent, but at or below 200
 14 23 percent, of the U.S. poverty level and paying for the ignition
 14 24 interlock device would cause the person substantial hardship.
 14 25    The bill provides for county sobriety monitoring pilot
 14 26 programs. The bill allows the department of public health
 14 27 (DPH), in collaboration with the department of corrections,
 14 28 the department of public safety, and the DOT, to approve
 14 29 applications from counties for countywide sobriety monitoring
 14 30 pilot programs. The programs are to be available 24 hours per
 14 31 day, seven days per week, in an effort to reduce the number
 14 32 of crimes related to OWI.  One application shall be approved
 14 33 for a county with a population of 200,000 people or more, one
 14 34 application shall be approved for a county with a population of
 14 35 100,000 people or more but less than 200,000 people, and one
 15  1 application shall be approved for a county with a population of
 15  2 less than 100,000 people.
 15  3    The programs shall require individuals charged with or
 15  4 convicted of OWI to abstain from all chemical substances for
 15  5 a period of time. The programs are to require testing to
 15  6 determine whether a chemical substance is present at least
 15  7 twice per day at a central location where an immediate sanction
 15  8 can be applied or, where such testing is impractical, by
 15  9 continuous transdermal or electronic monitoring. The programs
 15 10 shall also apply sanctions when test results definitively
 15 11 indicate the presence of a chemical substance. The programs
 15 12 shall require participants to pay program costs and to install
 15 13 an ignition interlock device.
 15 14    A court in a county that has established a pilot program
 15 15 may order a defendant, as a condition of pretrial release,
 15 16 probation, or bond, to participate in the program. Approved
 15 17 pilot programs shall begin January 15, 2017, or upon the
 15 18 effective date of DPH rules, whichever is earlier, and shall
 15 19 be conducted for a minimum of one year. The DPH is to adopt
 15 20 rules to implement the programs, including but not limited to
 15 21 provisions relating to applications for, approval of, costs of,
 15 22 and oversight of the pilot programs and reporting requirements
 15 23 for participating counties. The DPH is directed to submit
 15 24 a report on the results of the pilot programs and make
 15 25 recommendations to the general assembly by December 15, 2018.

 10 28    c.  A person is indigent for the purposes of this subsection
 10 29 if any of the following apply:
 10 30    (1)  The person has an income level at or below one hundred
 10 31 twenty=five percent of the United States poverty level as
 10 32 defined by the most recently revised poverty income guidelines

 11 20    Sec. 15.  SOBRIETY MONITORING PILOT PROGRAMS.
 11 21    1.  The department of public health, in collaboration
 11 22 with the department of corrections, the department of public

 13  4 123.3 and controlled substances as defined in section 124.101.
 13  5                           EXPLANATION
 13  6 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
 13  7 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
 13  8    Current law requires a person guilty of operating while
 13  9 intoxicated (OWI) to install an ignition interlock device in
 13 10 the person's vehicle if the person seeks a temporary restricted
 13 11 license, unless the person's alcohol concentration was less
 13 12 than .10 and no accident occurred. This bill strikes that
 13 13 exception, and also requires a person guilty of OWI to install
 13 14 an ignition interlock device in the person's vehicle upon the
 13 15 revocation of the person's driver's license rather than upon
 13 16 the person's application for a temporary restricted license.
 13 17    Under current law, an ignition interlock device is required
 13 18 to be installed in a person's vehicle for the period of time
 13 19 for which the person's temporary restricted license is issued,
 13 20 and up to one additional year after license reinstatement if
 13 21 the person has two or more OWI revocations. The bill requires
 13 22 the permanent installation of an ignition interlock device with
 13 23 two exceptions. If the ignition interlock device was installed
 13 24 as a result of the person's first OWI offense or revocation and
 13 25 a test was obtained, the device shall be uninstalled 180 days
 13 26 after the person's license was revoked, the person last failed
 13 27 a test by the ignition interlock device, or the defendant last
 13 28 failed to maintain the device as required, whichever is latest.
 13 29 If the ignition interlock device was installed as a result of
 13 30 the person's first OWI offense or revocation and a test was
 13 31 refused, the device shall be uninstalled 180 days after the
 13 32 person's license revocation period is over, the person last
 13 33 failed a test by the ignition interlock device, or the person
 13 34 last failed to maintain the device as required, whichever is
 13 35 latest.
 14  1 The bill provides an ignition interlock device shall not
 14  2 be uninstalled if the person has been convicted of a second
 14  3 or subsequent OWI violation, if the person's license has been
 14  4 revoked for a second or subsequent time, or if the person has
 14  5 been convicted of tampering with or circumventing an ignition
 14  6 interlock device.
 14  7    The bill requires the department of transportation (DOT)
 14  8 to assess a monthly ignition interlock user fee to each user
 14  9 of an ignition interlock device. All ignition interlock user
 14 10 fees will be collected by the DOT and deposited in an ignition
 14 11 interlock indigent user fund (IIIUF). The bill requires the
 14 12 DOT to use the moneys in the IIIUF to assist indigent users
 14 13 of ignition interlock devices in paying for the use of the
 14 14 devices. The amount of the monthly ignition interlock user fee
 14 15 shall be set by the DOT so that the moneys in the IIIUF are
 14 16 sufficient to assist all indigent users of ignition interlock
 14 17 devices in paying for the use of the devices.
 14 18    Under the bill, a person is indigent if the person has an
 14 19 income level at or below 125 percent of the U.S. poverty level
 14 20 and the person is unable to pay for the cost of an ignition
 14 21 interlock device. A person is also indigent if the person has
 14 22 an income level greater than 125 percent, but at or below 200
 14 23 percent, of the U.S. poverty level and paying for the ignition
 14 24 interlock device would cause the person substantial hardship.
 14 25    The bill provides for county sobriety monitoring pilot
 14 26 programs. The bill allows the department of public health
 14 27 (DPH), in collaboration with the department of corrections,
 14 28 the department of public safety, and the DOT, to approve
 14 29 applications from counties for countywide sobriety monitoring
 14 30 pilot programs. The programs are to be available 24 hours per
 14 31 day, seven days per week, in an effort to reduce the number
 14 32 of crimes related to OWI.  One application shall be approved
 14 33 for a county with a population of 200,000 people or more, one
 14 34 application shall be approved for a county with a population of
 14 35 100,000 people or more but less than 200,000 people, and one
 15  1 application shall be approved for a county with a population of
 15  2 less than 100,000 people.
 15  3    The programs shall require individuals charged with or
 15  4 convicted of OWI to abstain from all chemical substances for
 15  5 a period of time. The programs are to require testing to
 15  6 determine whether a chemical substance is present at least
 15  7 twice per day at a central location where an immediate sanction
 15  8 can be applied or, where such testing is impractical, by
 15  9 continuous transdermal or electronic monitoring. The programs
 15 10 shall also apply sanctions when test results definitively
 15 11 indicate the presence of a chemical substance. The programs
 15 12 shall require participants to pay program costs and to install
 15 13 an ignition interlock device.
 15 14    A court in a county that has established a pilot program
 15 15 may order a defendant, as a condition of pretrial release,
 15 16 probation, or bond, to participate in the program. Approved
 15 17 pilot programs shall begin January 15, 2017, or upon the
 15 18 effective date of DPH rules, whichever is earlier, and shall

 15 20 rules to implement the programs, including but not limited to
 15 21 provisions relating to applications for, approval of, costs of,
 15 22 and oversight of the pilot programs and reporting requirements
 15 23 for participating counties. The DPH is directed to submit

 10  8 department, may adopt rules to administer this subsection.
 10  9    2.  a.  An ignition interlock indigent user fund is created
 10 10 in the state treasury. The fund shall be administered by
 10 11 the department and shall consist of moneys collected by the
 10 12 department under this subsection. The moneys in the fund are
 10 13 appropriated to and shall be used by the department to assist
 10 14 indigent users of ignition interlock devices in paying for the
 10 15 use of the devices. Notwithstanding section 8.33, moneys in
 10 16 the fund at the end of each fiscal year shall not revert to any
 10 17 other fund but shall remain in the fund for expenditure for
 10 18 subsequent fiscal years.
 10 19    b.  Each month, the department shall assess an ignition
 10 20 interlock user fee to each user of an ignition interlock
 10 21 device. All ignition interlock user fees shall be collected by
 10 22 the department and deposited in the ignition interlock indigent
 10 23 user fund. The amount of the monthly ignition interlock user
 10 24 fee shall be set by the department so that the moneys in the
 10 25 ignition interlock indigent user fund are sufficient to assist
 10 26 all indigent users of ignition interlock devices in paying for
 10 27 the use of the devices.
 10 28    c.  A person is indigent for the purposes of this subsection
 10 29 if any of the following apply:
 10 30    (1)  The person has an income level at or below one hundred
 10 31 twenty=five percent of the United States poverty level as
 10 32 defined by the most recently revised poverty income guidelines
 10 33 published by the United States department of health and human
 10 34 services, and the department determines that the person is
 10 35 unable to pay for the cost of an ignition interlock device. In
 11  1 making the determination of a person's ability to pay for the
 11  2 cost of a device, the department shall consider not only the
 11  3 person's income, but also the person's other assets, including
 11  4 but not limited to cash, stocks, bonds, and any other property.
 11  5    (2)  The person has an income level greater than one hundred
 11  6 twenty=five percent, but at or below two hundred percent, of
 11  7 the most recently revised poverty income guidelines published
 11  8 by the United States department of health and human services,
 11  9 and the department determines that paying for the ignition
 11 10 interlock device would cause the person substantial hardship.
 11 11 In determining whether substantial hardship would result, the
 11 12 department shall consider not only the person's income, but
 11 13 also the person's other assets, including but not limited to
 11 14 cash, stocks, bonds, and any other property.
 11 15    d.  The department shall adopt rules to administer this
 11 16 subsection, including but not limited to the manner used to
 11 17 determine the monthly ignition interlock user fee and the
 11 18 accepted form and manner in which a person may demonstrate
 11 19 indigency.
 11 20    Sec. 15.  SOBRIETY MONITORING PILOT PROGRAMS.
 11 21    1.  The department of public health, in collaboration
 11 22 with the department of corrections, the department of public
 11 23 safety, and the department of transportation, may approve an
 11 24 application from a county for a countywide sobriety monitoring
 11 25 pilot program that is available twenty=four hours per day,
 11 26 seven days per week, in an effort to reduce the number of
 11 27 crimes related to operating while intoxicated. One application
 11 28 shall be approved for a county with a population of two hundred
 11 29 thousand people or more, one application shall be approved
 11 30 for a county with a population of one hundred thousand people
 11 31 or more but less than two hundred thousand people, and one
 11 32 application shall be approved for a county with a population of
 11 33 less than one hundred thousand people.
 11 34    2.  A sobriety monitoring pilot program shall do all of the
 11 35 following:
 12  1    a.  Require a person who has been charged with, pled guilty
 12  2 to, or been convicted of a violation of section 321J.2 to
 12  3 abstain from all chemical substances for a period of time.
 12  4    b.  Require the person to be subject to testing to determine
 12  5 whether a chemical substance is present in the person's body
 12  6 in the following manner:
 12  7    (1)  At least twice per day at a central location where an
 12  8 immediate sanction can be applied.
 12  9    (2)  Where testing under subparagraph (1) is impractical, by
 12 10 continuous transdermal or electronic monitoring.
 12 11    c.  Apply sanctions when test results definitively, and
 12 12 without presumption, indicate the presence of chemical
 12 13 substances.
 12 14    d.  Require a person participating in the program to pay
 12 15 program costs, including costs of installation, monitoring, and
 12 16 deactivation of any testing devices.
 12 17    e.  Require the person to install an ignition interlock
 12 18 device of a type approved by the commissioner of public safety
 12 19 on all vehicles owned or operated by the person, and require
 12 20 the person to pay the costs associated with the installation
 12 21 and use of the ignition interlock device.
 12 22    3.  A court in a county that has established a pilot program
 12 23 pursuant to this section may order a defendant, as a condition
 12 24 of pretrial release, probation, or bond, to participate in the
 12 25 program.
 12 26    4.  An approved pilot program shall begin on January 15,
 12 27 2017, or upon the effective date of department rules, whichever
 12 28 is earlier, and shall be conducted for a minimum of one year.
 12 29    5.  The department of public health shall adopt rules
 12 30 pursuant to chapter 17A to implement this section including
 12 31 but not limited to provisions relating to applications for,
 12 32 approval of, costs of, and oversight of the pilot programs and
 12 33 reporting requirements for participating counties.
 12 34    6.  The department of public health shall submit a report on
 12 35 the results of the pilot programs and make recommendations to
 13  1 the general assembly by December 15, 2018.
 13  2    7.  For the purposes of this section, "chemical substance"
 13  3 means alcohol, wine, spirits, and beer as defined in section
 13  4 123.3 and controlled substances as defined in section 124.101.
 13  5                           EXPLANATION
 13  6 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
 13  7 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
 13  8    Current law requires a person guilty of operating while
 13  9 intoxicated (OWI) to install an ignition interlock device in
 13 10 the person's vehicle if the person seeks a temporary restricted
 13 11 license, unless the person's alcohol concentration was less
 13 12 than .10 and no accident occurred. This bill strikes that
 13 13 exception, and also requires a person guilty of OWI to install
 13 14 an ignition interlock device in the person's vehicle upon the
 13 15 revocation of the person's driver's license rather than upon
 13 16 the person's application for a temporary restricted license.
 13 17    Under current law, an ignition interlock device is required
 13 18 to be installed in a person's vehicle for the period of time
 13 19 for which the person's temporary restricted license is issued,
 13 20 and up to one additional year after license reinstatement if
 13 21 the person has two or more OWI revocations. The bill requires
 13 22 the permanent installation of an ignition interlock device with
 13 23 two exceptions. If the ignition interlock device was installed
 13 24 as a result of the person's first OWI offense or revocation and
 13 25 a test was obtained, the device shall be uninstalled 180 days
 13 26 after the person's license was revoked, the person last failed
 13 27 a test by the ignition interlock device, or the defendant last
 13 28 failed to maintain the device as required, whichever is latest.
 13 29 If the ignition interlock device was installed as a result of
 13 30 the person's first OWI offense or revocation and a test was
 13 31 refused, the device shall be uninstalled 180 days after the
 13 32 person's license revocation period is over, the person last
 13 33 failed a test by the ignition interlock device, or the person
 13 34 last failed to maintain the device as required, whichever is
 13 35 latest.
 14  1 The bill provides an ignition interlock device shall not
 14  2 be uninstalled if the person has been convicted of a second
 14  3 or subsequent OWI violation, if the person's license has been
 14  4 revoked for a second or subsequent time, or if the person has
 14  5 been convicted of tampering with or circumventing an ignition
 14  6 interlock device.
 14  7    The bill requires the department of transportation (DOT)
 14  8 to assess a monthly ignition interlock user fee to each user
 14  9 of an ignition interlock device. All ignition interlock user
 14 10 fees will be collected by the DOT and deposited in an ignition
 14 11 interlock indigent user fund (IIIUF). The bill requires the
 14 12 DOT to use the moneys in the IIIUF to assist indigent users
 14 13 of ignition interlock devices in paying for the use of the
 14 14 devices. The amount of the monthly ignition interlock user fee
 14 15 shall be set by the DOT so that the moneys in the IIIUF are
 14 16 sufficient to assist all indigent users of ignition interlock
 14 17 devices in paying for the use of the devices.
 14 18    Under the bill, a person is indigent if the person has an
 14 19 income level at or below 125 percent of the U.S. poverty level
 14 20 and the person is unable to pay for the cost of an ignition
 14 21 interlock device. A person is also indigent if the person has
 14 22 an income level greater than 125 percent, but at or below 200
 14 23 percent, of the U.S. poverty level and paying for the ignition
 14 24 interlock device would cause the person substantial hardship.
 14 25    The bill provides for county sobriety monitoring pilot
 14 26 programs. The bill allows the department of public health
 14 27 (DPH), in collaboration with the department of corrections,
 14 28 the department of public safety, and the DOT, to approve
 14 29 applications from counties for countywide sobriety monitoring
 14 30 pilot programs. The programs are to be available 24 hours per
 14 31 day, seven days per week, in an effort to reduce the number
 14 32 of crimes related to OWI.  One application shall be approved
 14 33 for a county with a population of 200,000 people or more, one
 14 34 application shall be approved for a county with a population of
 14 35 100,000 people or more but less than 200,000 people, and one
 15  1 application shall be approved for a county with a population of
 15  2 less than 100,000 people.
 15  3    The programs shall require individuals charged with or
 15  4 convicted of OWI to abstain from all chemical substances for
 15  5 a period of time. The programs are to require testing to
 15  6 determine whether a chemical substance is present at least
 15  7 twice per day at a central location where an immediate sanction
 15  8 can be applied or, where such testing is impractical, by
 15  9 continuous transdermal or electronic monitoring. The programs
 15 10 shall also apply sanctions when test results definitively
 15 11 indicate the presence of a chemical substance. The programs
 15 12 shall require participants to pay program costs and to install
 15 13 an ignition interlock device.
 15 14    A court in a county that has established a pilot program
 15 15 may order a defendant, as a condition of pretrial release,
 15 16 probation, or bond, to participate in the program. Approved
 15 17 pilot programs shall begin January 15, 2017, or upon the
 15 18 effective date of DPH rules, whichever is earlier, and shall
 15 19 be conducted for a minimum of one year. The DPH is to adopt
 15 20 rules to implement the programs, including but not limited to
 15 21 provisions relating to applications for, approval of, costs of,
 15 22 and oversight of the pilot programs and reporting requirements
 15 23 for participating counties. The DPH is directed to submit
 15 24 a report on the results of the pilot programs and make
 15 25 recommendations to the general assembly by December 15, 2018.

 10  9    2.  a.  An ignition interlock indigent user fund is created
 10 10 in the state treasury. The fund shall be administered by
 10 11 the department and shall consist of moneys collected by the
 10 12 department under this subsection. The moneys in the fund are
 10 13 appropriated to and shall be used by the department to assist
 10 14 indigent users of ignition interlock devices in paying for the
 10 15 use of the devices. Notwithstanding section 8.33, moneys in
 10 16 the fund at the end of each fiscal year shall not revert to any
 10 17 other fund but shall remain in the fund for expenditure for
 10 18 subsequent fiscal years.
 10 19    b.  Each month, the department shall assess an ignition
 10 20 interlock user fee to each user of an ignition interlock
 10 21 device. All ignition interlock user fees shall be collected by
 10 22 the department and deposited in the ignition interlock indigent
 10 23 user fund. The amount of the monthly ignition interlock user
 10 24 fee shall be set by the department so that the moneys in the
 10 25 ignition interlock indigent user fund are sufficient to assist
 10 26 all indigent users of ignition interlock devices in paying for
 10 27 the use of the devices.
 10 28    c.  A person is indigent for the purposes of this subsection
 10 29 if any of the following apply:
 10 30    (1)  The person has an income level at or below one hundred
 10 31 twenty=five percent of the United States poverty level as
 10 32 defined by the most recently revised poverty income guidelines
 10 33 published by the United States department of health and human
 10 34 services, and the department determines that the person is
 10 35 unable to pay for the cost of an ignition interlock device. In
 11  1 making the determination of a person's ability to pay for the
 11  2 cost of a device, the department shall consider not only the
 11  3 person's income, but also the person's other assets, including
 11  4 but not limited to cash, stocks, bonds, and any other property.
 11  5    (2)  The person has an income level greater than one hundred
 11  6 twenty=five percent, but at or below two hundred percent, of
 11  7 the most recently revised poverty income guidelines published
 11  8 by the United States department of health and human services,
 11  9 and the department determines that paying for the ignition
 11 10 interlock device would cause the person substantial hardship.
 11 11 In determining whether substantial hardship would result, the
 11 12 department shall consider not only the person's income, but
 11 13 also the person's other assets, including but not limited to
 11 14 cash, stocks, bonds, and any other property.
 11 15    d.  The department shall adopt rules to administer this
 11 16 subsection, including but not limited to the manner used to
 11 17 determine the monthly ignition interlock user fee and the
 11 18 accepted form and manner in which a person may demonstrate
 11 19 indigency.
 11 20    Sec. 15.  SOBRIETY MONITORING PILOT PROGRAMS.
 11 21    1.  The department of public health, in collaboration
 11 22 with the department of corrections, the department of public
 11 23 safety, and the department of transportation, may approve an
 11 24 application from a county for a countywide sobriety monitoring
 11 25 pilot program that is available twenty=four hours per day,
 11 26 seven days per week, in an effort to reduce the number of
 11 27 crimes related to operating while intoxicated. One application
 11 28 shall be approved for a county with a population of two hundred
 11 29 thousand people or more, one application shall be approved
 11 30 for a county with a population of one hundred thousand people
 11 31 or more but less than two hundred thousand people, and one
 11 32 application shall be approved for a county with a population of
 11 33 less than one hundred thousand people.
 11 34    2.  A sobriety monitoring pilot program shall do all of the
 11 35 following:
 12  1    a.  Require a person who has been charged with, pled guilty
 12  2 to, or been convicted of a violation of section 321J.2 to

 12  9    (2)  Where testing under subparagraph (1) is impractical, by
 12 10 continuous transdermal or electronic monitoring.
 12 11    c.  Apply sanctions when test results definitively, and
 12 12 without presumption, indicate the presence of chemical
 12 13 substances.
 12 14    d.  Require a person participating in the program to pay
 12 15 program costs, including costs of installation, monitoring, and
 12 16 deactivation of any testing devices.
 12 17    e.  Require the person to install an ignition interlock
 12 18 device of a type approved by the commissioner of public safety
 12 19 on all vehicles owned or operated by the person, and require
 12 20 the person to pay the costs associated with the installation
 12 21 and use of the ignition interlock device.
 12 22    3.  A court in a county that has established a pilot program
 12 23 pursuant to this section may order a defendant, as a condition
 12 24 of pretrial release, probation, or bond, to participate in the
 12 25 program.
 12 26    4.  An approved pilot program shall begin on January 15,
 12 27 2017, or upon the effective date of department rules, whichever
 12 28 is earlier, and shall be conducted for a minimum of one year.
 12 29    5.  The department of public health shall adopt rules
 12 30 pursuant to chapter 17A to implement this section including
 12 31 but not limited to provisions relating to applications for,
 12 32 approval of, costs of, and oversight of the pilot programs and
 12 33 reporting requirements for participating counties.
 12 34    6.  The department of public health shall submit a report on
 12 35 the results of the pilot programs and make recommendations to
 13  1 the general assembly by December 15, 2018.
 13  2    7.  For the purposes of this section, "chemical substance"
 13  3 means alcohol, wine, spirits, and beer as defined in section
 13  4 123.3 and controlled substances as defined in section 124.101.
 13  5                           EXPLANATION
 13  6 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
 13  7 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
 13  8    Current law requires a person guilty of operating while
 13  9 intoxicated (OWI) to install an ignition interlock device in
 13 10 the person's vehicle if the person seeks a temporary restricted
 13 11 license, unless the person's alcohol concentration was less
 13 12 than .10 and no accident occurred. This bill strikes that
 13 13 exception, and also requires a person guilty of OWI to install
 13 14 an ignition interlock device in the person's vehicle upon the
 13 15 revocation of the person's driver's license rather than upon
 13 16 the person's application for a temporary restricted license.
 13 17    Under current law, an ignition interlock device is required
 13 18 to be installed in a person's vehicle for the period of time
 13 19 for which the person's temporary restricted license is issued,
 13 20 and up to one additional year after license reinstatement if
 13 21 the person has two or more OWI revocations. The bill requires
 13 22 the permanent installation of an ignition interlock device with
 13 23 two exceptions. If the ignition interlock device was installed
 13 24 as a result of the person's first OWI offense or revocation and
 13 25 a test was obtained, the device shall be uninstalled 180 days
 13 26 after the person's license was revoked, the person last failed
 13 27 a test by the ignition interlock device, or the defendant last
 13 28 failed to maintain the device as required, whichever is latest.
 13 29 If the ignition interlock device was installed as a result of
 13 30 the person's first OWI offense or revocation and a test was
 13 31 refused, the device shall be uninstalled 180 days after the
 13 32 person's license revocation period is over, the person last
 13 33 failed a test by the ignition interlock device, or the person
 13 34 last failed to maintain the device as required, whichever is
 13 35 latest.
 14  1 The bill provides an ignition interlock device shall not
 14  2 be uninstalled if the person has been convicted of a second
 14  3 or subsequent OWI violation, if the person's license has been
 14  4 revoked for a second or subsequent time, or if the person has
 14  5 been convicted of tampering with or circumventing an ignition
 14  6 interlock device.
 14  7    The bill requires the department of transportation (DOT)
 14  8 to assess a monthly ignition interlock user fee to each user
 14  9 of an ignition interlock device. All ignition interlock user
 14 10 fees will be collected by the DOT and deposited in an ignition
 14 11 interlock indigent user fund (IIIUF). The bill requires the
 14 12 DOT to use the moneys in the IIIUF to assist indigent users
 14 13 of ignition interlock devices in paying for the use of the
 14 14 devices. The amount of the monthly ignition interlock user fee
 14 15 shall be set by the DOT so that the moneys in the IIIUF are
 14 16 sufficient to assist all indigent users of ignition interlock
 14 17 devices in paying for the use of the devices.
 14 18    Under the bill, a person is indigent if the person has an
 14 19 income level at or below 125 percent of the U.S. poverty level
 14 20 and the person is unable to pay for the cost of an ignition
 14 21 interlock device. A person is also indigent if the person has
 14 22 an income level greater than 125 percent, but at or below 200
 14 23 percent, of the U.S. poverty level and paying for the ignition
 14 24 interlock device would cause the person substantial hardship.
 14 25    The bill provides for county sobriety monitoring pilot
 14 26 programs. The bill allows the department of public health
 14 27 (DPH), in collaboration with the department of corrections,
 14 28 the department of public safety, and the DOT, to approve
 14 29 applications from counties for countywide sobriety monitoring
 14 30 pilot programs. The programs are to be available 24 hours per
 14 31 day, seven days per week, in an effort to reduce the number
 14 32 of crimes related to OWI.  One application shall be approved
 14 33 for a county with a population of 200,000 people or more, one
 14 34 application shall be approved for a county with a population of
 14 35 100,000 people or more but less than 200,000 people, and one
 15  1 application shall be approved for a county with a population of
 15  2 less than 100,000 people.
 15  3    The programs shall require individuals charged with or
 15  4 convicted of OWI to abstain from all chemical substances for
 15  5 a period of time. The programs are to require testing to
 15  6 determine whether a chemical substance is present at least
 15  7 twice per day at a central location where an immediate sanction
 15  8 can be applied or, where such testing is impractical, by
 15  9 continuous transdermal or electronic monitoring. The programs
 15 10 shall also apply sanctions when test results definitively
 15 11 indicate the presence of a chemical substance. The programs
 15 12 shall require participants to pay program costs and to install
 15 13 an ignition interlock device.
 15 14    A court in a county that has established a pilot program
 15 15 may order a defendant, as a condition of pretrial release,
 15 16 probation, or bond, to participate in the program. Approved
 15 17 pilot programs shall begin January 15, 2017, or upon the
 15 18 effective date of DPH rules, whichever is earlier, and shall
 15 19 be conducted for a minimum of one year. The DPH is to adopt
 15 20 rules to implement the programs, including but not limited to
 15 21 provisions relating to applications for, approval of, costs of,
 15 22 and oversight of the pilot programs and reporting requirements
 15 23 for participating counties. The DPH is directed to submit
 15 24 a report on the results of the pilot programs and make
 15 25 recommendations to the general assembly by December 15, 2018.

 10 20 interlock user fee to each user of an ignition interlock
 10 21 device. All ignition interlock user fees shall be collected by
 10 22 the department and deposited in the ignition interlock indigent
 10 23 user fund. The amount of the monthly ignition interlock user
 10 24 fee shall be set by the department so that the moneys in the
 10 25 ignition interlock indigent user fund are sufficient to assist
 10 26 all indigent users of ignition interlock devices in paying for
 10 27 the use of the devices.
 10 28    c.  A person is indigent for the purposes of this subsection
 10 29 if any of the following apply:
 10 30    (1)  The person has an income level at or below one hundred
 10 31 twenty=five percent of the United States poverty level as
 10 32 defined by the most recently revised poverty income guidelines
 10 33 published by the United States department of health and human
 10 34 services, and the department determines that the person is
 10 35 unable to pay for the cost of an ignition interlock device. In
 11  1 making the determination of a person's ability to pay for the
 11  2 cost of a device, the department shall consider not only the
 11  3 person's income, but also the person's other assets, including
 11  4 but not limited to cash, stocks, bonds, and any other property.
 11  5    (2)  The person has an income level greater than one hundred
 11  6 twenty=five percent, but at or below two hundred percent, of
 11  7 the most recently revised poverty income guidelines published
 11  8 by the United States department of health and human services,
 11  9 and the department determines that paying for the ignition
 11 10 interlock device would cause the person substantial hardship.
 11 11 In determining whether substantial hardship would result, the
 11 12 department shall consider not only the person's income, but
 11 13 also the person's other assets, including but not limited to
 11 14 cash, stocks, bonds, and any other property.
 11 15    d.  The department shall adopt rules to administer this
 11 16 subsection, including but not limited to the manner used to
 11 17 determine the monthly ignition interlock user fee and the
 11 18 accepted form and manner in which a person may demonstrate
 11 19 indigency.
 11 20    Sec. 15.  SOBRIETY MONITORING PILOT PROGRAMS.
 11 21    1.  The department of public health, in collaboration
 11 22 with the department of corrections, the department of public
 11 23 safety, and the department of transportation, may approve an
 11 24 application from a county for a countywide sobriety monitoring
 11 25 pilot program that is available twenty=four hours per day,
 11 26 seven days per week, in an effort to reduce the number of
 11 27 crimes related to operating while intoxicated. One application
 11 28 shall be approved for a county with a population of two hundred
 11 29 thousand people or more, one application shall be approved
 11 30 for a county with a population of one hundred thousand people
 11 31 or more but less than two hundred thousand people, and one
 11 32 application shall be approved for a county with a population of
 11 33 less than one hundred thousand people.
 11 34    2.  A sobriety monitoring pilot program shall do all of the
 11 35 following:
 12  1    a.  Require a person who has been charged with, pled guilty
 12  2 to, or been convicted of a violation of section 321J.2 to
 12  3 abstain from all chemical substances for a period of time.
 12  4    b.  Require the person to be subject to testing to determine
 12  5 whether a chemical substance is present in the person's body
 12  6 in the following manner:
 12  7    (1)  At least twice per day at a central location where an
 12  8 immediate sanction can be applied.
 12  9    (2)  Where testing under subparagraph (1) is impractical, by
 12 10 continuous transdermal or electronic monitoring.
 12 11    c.  Apply sanctions when test results definitively, and
 12 12 without presumption, indicate the presence of chemical
 12 13 substances.
 12 14    d.  Require a person participating in the program to pay
 12 15 program costs, including costs of installation, monitoring, and
 12 16 deactivation of any testing devices.
 12 17    e.  Require the person to install an ignition interlock
 12 18 device of a type approved by the commissioner of public safety
 12 19 on all vehicles owned or operated by the person, and require
 12 20 the person to pay the costs associated with the installation
 12 21 and use of the ignition interlock device.
 12 22    3.  A court in a county that has established a pilot program
 12 23 pursuant to this section may order a defendant, as a condition
 12 24 of pretrial release, probation, or bond, to participate in the
 12 25 program.
 12 26    4.  An approved pilot program shall begin on January 15,
 12 27 2017, or upon the effective date of department rules, whichever
 12 28 is earlier, and shall be conducted for a minimum of one year.
 12 29    5.  The department of public health shall adopt rules
 12 30 pursuant to chapter 17A to implement this section including
 12 31 but not limited to provisions relating to applications for,
 12 32 approval of, costs of, and oversight of the pilot programs and
 12 33 reporting requirements for participating counties.
 12 34    6.  The department of public health shall submit a report on
 12 35 the results of the pilot programs and make recommendations to
 13  1 the general assembly by December 15, 2018.
 13  2    7.  For the purposes of this section, "chemical substance"
 13  3 means alcohol, wine, spirits, and beer as defined in section
 13  4 123.3 and controlled substances as defined in section 124.101.
 13  5                           EXPLANATION
 13  6 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
 13  7 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
 13  8    Current law requires a person guilty of operating while
 13  9 intoxicated (OWI) to install an ignition interlock device in
 13 10 the person's vehicle if the person seeks a temporary restricted
 13 11 license, unless the person's alcohol concentration was less
 13 12 than .10 and no accident occurred. This bill strikes that
 13 13 exception, and also requires a person guilty of OWI to install
 13 14 an ignition interlock device in the person's vehicle upon the
 13 15 revocation of the person's driver's license rather than upon
 13 16 the person's application for a temporary restricted license.
 13 17    Under current law, an ignition interlock device is required
 13 18 to be installed in a person's vehicle for the period of time
 13 19 for which the person's temporary restricted license is issued,
 13 20 and up to one additional year after license reinstatement if
 13 21 the person has two or more OWI revocations. The bill requires
 13 22 the permanent installation of an ignition interlock device with
 13 23 two exceptions. If the ignition interlock device was installed
 13 24 as a result of the person's first OWI offense or revocation and
 13 25 a test was obtained, the device shall be uninstalled 180 days
 13 26 after the person's license was revoked, the person last failed
 13 27 a test by the ignition interlock device, or the defendant last
 13 28 failed to maintain the device as required, whichever is latest.
 13 29 If the ignition interlock device was installed as a result of
 13 30 the person's first OWI offense or revocation and a test was
 13 31 refused, the device shall be uninstalled 180 days after the
 13 32 person's license revocation period is over, the person last
 13 33 failed a test by the ignition interlock device, or the person
 13 34 last failed to maintain the device as required, whichever is
 13 35 latest.
 14  1 The bill provides an ignition interlock device shall not
 14  2 be uninstalled if the person has been convicted of a second
 14  3 or subsequent OWI violation, if the person's license has been
 14  4 revoked for a second or subsequent time, or if the person has
 14  5 been convicted of tampering with or circumventing an ignition
 14  6 interlock device.
 14  7    The bill requires the department of transportation (DOT)
 14  8 to assess a monthly ignition interlock user fee to each user
 14  9 of an ignition interlock device. All ignition interlock user
 14 10 fees will be collected by the DOT and deposited in an ignition
 14 11 interlock indigent user fund (IIIUF). The bill requires the
 14 12 DOT to use the moneys in the IIIUF to assist indigent users
 14 13 of ignition interlock devices in paying for the use of the
 14 14 devices. The amount of the monthly ignition interlock user fee
 14 15 shall be set by the DOT so that the moneys in the IIIUF are
 14 16 sufficient to assist all indigent users of ignition interlock
 14 17 devices in paying for the use of the devices.
 14 18    Under the bill, a person is indigent if the person has an
 14 19 income level at or below 125 percent of the U.S. poverty level
 14 20 and the person is unable to pay for the cost of an ignition
 14 21 interlock device. A person is also indigent if the person has
 14 22 an income level greater than 125 percent, but at or below 200
 14 23 percent, of the U.S. poverty level and paying for the ignition
 14 24 interlock device would cause the person substantial hardship.
 14 25    The bill provides for county sobriety monitoring pilot
 14 26 programs. The bill allows the department of public health
 14 27 (DPH), in collaboration with the department of corrections,
 14 28 the department of public safety, and the DOT, to approve
 14 29 applications from counties for countywide sobriety monitoring
 14 30 pilot programs. The programs are to be available 24 hours per
 14 31 day, seven days per week, in an effort to reduce the number
 14 32 of crimes related to OWI.  One application shall be approved
 14 33 for a county with a population of 200,000 people or more, one
 14 34 application shall be approved for a county with a population of
 14 35 100,000 people or more but less than 200,000 people, and one
 15  1 application shall be approved for a county with a population of
 15  2 less than 100,000 people.
 15  3    The programs shall require individuals charged with or
 15  4 convicted of OWI to abstain from all chemical substances for
 15  5 a period of time. The programs are to require testing to
 15  6 determine whether a chemical substance is present at least
 15  7 twice per day at a central location where an immediate sanction
 15  8 can be applied or, where such testing is impractical, by
 15  9 continuous transdermal or electronic monitoring. The programs
 15 10 shall also apply sanctions when test results definitively
 15 11 indicate the presence of a chemical substance. The programs
 15 12 shall require participants to pay program costs and to install
 15 13 an ignition interlock device.
 15 14    A court in a county that has established a pilot program
 15 15 may order a defendant, as a condition of pretrial release,
 15 16 probation, or bond, to participate in the program. Approved
 15 17 pilot programs shall begin January 15, 2017, or upon the
 15 18 effective date of DPH rules, whichever is earlier, and shall
 15 19 be conducted for a minimum of one year. The DPH is to adopt
 15 20 rules to implement the programs, including but not limited to
 15 21 provisions relating to applications for, approval of, costs of,
 15 22 and oversight of the pilot programs and reporting requirements
 15 23 for participating counties. The DPH is directed to submit
 15 24 a report on the results of the pilot programs and make
 15 25 recommendations to the general assembly by December 15, 2018.

 13  5                           EXPLANATION
 13  6 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
 13  7 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
 13  8    Current law requires a person guilty of operating while
 13  9 intoxicated (OWI) to install an ignition interlock device in
 13 10 the person's vehicle if the person seeks a temporary restricted
 13 11 license, unless the person's alcohol concentration was less

 13 13 exception, and also requires a person guilty of OWI to install
 13 14 an ignition interlock device in the person's vehicle upon the
 13 15 revocation of the person's driver's license rather than upon

 13 17    Under current law, an ignition interlock device is required
 13 18 to be installed in a person's vehicle for the period of time
 13 19 for which the person's temporary restricted license is issued,

 13 33 failed a test by the ignition interlock device, or the person
 13 34 last failed to maintain the device as required, whichever is
 13 35 latest.
 14  1 The bill provides an ignition interlock device shall not
 14  2 be uninstalled if the person has been convicted of a second
 14  3 or subsequent OWI violation, if the person's license has been
 14  4 revoked for a second or subsequent time, or if the person has
 14  5 been convicted of tampering with or circumventing an ignition
 14  6 interlock device.
 14  7    The bill requires the department of transportation (DOT)
 14  8 to assess a monthly ignition interlock user fee to each user
 14  9 of an ignition interlock device. All ignition interlock user
 14 10 fees will be collected by the DOT and deposited in an ignition

 14 15 shall be set by the DOT so that the moneys in the IIIUF are
 14 16 sufficient to assist all indigent users of ignition interlock
 14 17 devices in paying for the use of the devices.
 14 18    Under the bill, a person is indigent if the person has an
 14 19 income level at or below 125 percent of the U.S. poverty level
 14 20 and the person is unable to pay for the cost of an ignition
 14 21 interlock device. A person is also indigent if the person has
 14 22 an income level greater than 125 percent, but at or below 200
 14 23 percent, of the U.S. poverty level and paying for the ignition
 14 24 interlock device would cause the person substantial hardship.

 15  1 application shall be approved for a county with a population of
 15  2 less than 100,000 people.
 15  3    The programs shall require individuals charged with or
 15  4 convicted of OWI to abstain from all chemical substances for
 15  5 a period of time. The programs are to require testing to

 11  8 by the United States department of health and human services,
 11  9 and the department determines that paying for the ignition
 11 10 interlock device would cause the person substantial hardship.
 11 11 In determining whether substantial hardship would result, the
 11 12 department shall consider not only the person's income, but
 11 13 also the person's other assets, including but not limited to
 11 14 cash, stocks, bonds, and any other property.
 11 15    d.  The department shall adopt rules to administer this
 11 16 subsection, including but not limited to the manner used to
 11 17 determine the monthly ignition interlock user fee and the
 11 18 accepted form and manner in which a person may demonstrate
 11 19 indigency.
 11 20    Sec. 15.  SOBRIETY MONITORING PILOT PROGRAMS.
 11 21    1.  The department of public health, in collaboration
 11 22 with the department of corrections, the department of public
 11 23 safety, and the department of transportation, may approve an
 11 24 application from a county for a countywide sobriety monitoring
 11 25 pilot program that is available twenty=four hours per day,
 11 26 seven days per week, in an effort to reduce the number of
 11 27 crimes related to operating while intoxicated. One application
 11 28 shall be approved for a county with a population of two hundred
 11 29 thousand people or more, one application shall be approved
 11 30 for a county with a population of one hundred thousand people
 11 31 or more but less than two hundred thousand people, and one
 11 32 application shall be approved for a county with a population of
 11 33 less than one hundred thousand people.
 11 34    2.  A sobriety monitoring pilot program shall do all of the
 11 35 following:
 12  1    a.  Require a person who has been charged with, pled guilty
 12  2 to, or been convicted of a violation of section 321J.2 to
 12  3 abstain from all chemical substances for a period of time.
 12  4    b.  Require the person to be subject to testing to determine
 12  5 whether a chemical substance is present in the person's body
 12  6 in the following manner:
 12  7    (1)  At least twice per day at a central location where an
 12  8 immediate sanction can be applied.
 12  9    (2)  Where testing under subparagraph (1) is impractical, by
 12 10 continuous transdermal or electronic monitoring.
 12 11    c.  Apply sanctions when test results definitively, and
 12 12 without presumption, indicate the presence of chemical
 12 13 substances.
 12 14    d.  Require a person participating in the program to pay
 12 15 program costs, including costs of installation, monitoring, and
 12 16 deactivation of any testing devices.
 12 17    e.  Require the person to install an ignition interlock
 12 18 device of a type approved by the commissioner of public safety
 12 19 on all vehicles owned or operated by the person, and require
 12 20 the person to pay the costs associated with the installation
 12 21 and use of the ignition interlock device.
 12 22    3.  A court in a county that has established a pilot program
 12 23 pursuant to this section may order a defendant, as a condition
 12 24 of pretrial release, probation, or bond, to participate in the
 12 25 program.
 12 26    4.  An approved pilot program shall begin on January 15,
 12 27 2017, or upon the effective date of department rules, whichever
 12 28 is earlier, and shall be conducted for a minimum of one year.
 12 29    5.  The department of public health shall adopt rules
 12 30 pursuant to chapter 17A to implement this section including
 12 31 but not limited to provisions relating to applications for,
 12 32 approval of, costs of, and oversight of the pilot programs and
 12 33 reporting requirements for participating counties.
 12 34    6.  The department of public health shall submit a report on
 12 35 the results of the pilot programs and make recommendations to
 13  1 the general assembly by December 15, 2018.
 13  2    7.  For the purposes of this section, "chemical substance"
 13  3 means alcohol, wine, spirits, and beer as defined in section
 13  4 123.3 and controlled substances as defined in section 124.101.
 13  5                           EXPLANATION
 13  6 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
 13  7 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
 13  8    Current law requires a person guilty of operating while
 13  9 intoxicated (OWI) to install an ignition interlock device in
 13 10 the person's vehicle if the person seeks a temporary restricted
 13 11 license, unless the person's alcohol concentration was less
 13 12 than .10 and no accident occurred. This bill strikes that
 13 13 exception, and also requires a person guilty of OWI to install
 13 14 an ignition interlock device in the person's vehicle upon the
 13 15 revocation of the person's driver's license rather than upon
 13 16 the person's application for a temporary restricted license.
 13 17    Under current law, an ignition interlock device is required
 13 18 to be installed in a person's vehicle for the period of time
 13 19 for which the person's temporary restricted license is issued,
 13 20 and up to one additional year after license reinstatement if
 13 21 the person has two or more OWI revocations. The bill requires
 13 22 the permanent installation of an ignition interlock device with
 13 23 two exceptions. If the ignition interlock device was installed
 13 24 as a result of the person's first OWI offense or revocation and
 13 25 a test was obtained, the device shall be uninstalled 180 days
 13 26 after the person's license was revoked, the person last failed
 13 27 a test by the ignition interlock device, or the defendant last
 13 28 failed to maintain the device as required, whichever is latest.
 13 29 If the ignition interlock device was installed as a result of
 13 30 the person's first OWI offense or revocation and a test was
 13 31 refused, the device shall be uninstalled 180 days after the
 13 32 person's license revocation period is over, the person last
 13 33 failed a test by the ignition interlock device, or the person
 13 34 last failed to maintain the device as required, whichever is
 13 35 latest.
 14  1 The bill provides an ignition interlock device shall not
 14  2 be uninstalled if the person has been convicted of a second
 14  3 or subsequent OWI violation, if the person's license has been
 14  4 revoked for a second or subsequent time, or if the person has
 14  5 been convicted of tampering with or circumventing an ignition
 14  6 interlock device.
 14  7    The bill requires the department of transportation (DOT)
 14  8 to assess a monthly ignition interlock user fee to each user
 14  9 of an ignition interlock device. All ignition interlock user
 14 10 fees will be collected by the DOT and deposited in an ignition
 14 11 interlock indigent user fund (IIIUF). The bill requires the
 14 12 DOT to use the moneys in the IIIUF to assist indigent users
 14 13 of ignition interlock devices in paying for the use of the
 14 14 devices. The amount of the monthly ignition interlock user fee
 14 15 shall be set by the DOT so that the moneys in the IIIUF are
 14 16 sufficient to assist all indigent users of ignition interlock
 14 17 devices in paying for the use of the devices.
 14 18    Under the bill, a person is indigent if the person has an
 14 19 income level at or below 125 percent of the U.S. poverty level
 14 20 and the person is unable to pay for the cost of an ignition
 14 21 interlock device. A person is also indigent if the person has
 14 22 an income level greater than 125 percent, but at or below 200
 14 23 percent, of the U.S. poverty level and paying for the ignition
 14 24 interlock device would cause the person substantial hardship.
 14 25    The bill provides for county sobriety monitoring pilot
 14 26 programs. The bill allows the department of public health
 14 27 (DPH), in collaboration with the department of corrections,
 14 28 the department of public safety, and the DOT, to approve
 14 29 applications from counties for countywide sobriety monitoring
 14 30 pilot programs. The programs are to be available 24 hours per
 14 31 day, seven days per week, in an effort to reduce the number
 14 32 of crimes related to OWI.  One application shall be approved
 14 33 for a county with a population of 200,000 people or more, one
 14 34 application shall be approved for a county with a population of
 14 35 100,000 people or more but less than 200,000 people, and one
 15  1 application shall be approved for a county with a population of
 15  2 less than 100,000 people.
 15  3    The programs shall require individuals charged with or
 15  4 convicted of OWI to abstain from all chemical substances for
 15  5 a period of time. The programs are to require testing to
 15  6 determine whether a chemical substance is present at least
 15  7 twice per day at a central location where an immediate sanction
 15  8 can be applied or, where such testing is impractical, by
 15  9 continuous transdermal or electronic monitoring. The programs
 15 10 shall also apply sanctions when test results definitively
 15 11 indicate the presence of a chemical substance. The programs
 15 12 shall require participants to pay program costs and to install
 15 13 an ignition interlock device.
 15 14    A court in a county that has established a pilot program
 15 15 may order a defendant, as a condition of pretrial release,
 15 16 probation, or bond, to participate in the program. Approved
 15 17 pilot programs shall begin January 15, 2017, or upon the
 15 18 effective date of DPH rules, whichever is earlier, and shall
 15 19 be conducted for a minimum of one year. The DPH is to adopt
 15 20 rules to implement the programs, including but not limited to
 15 21 provisions relating to applications for, approval of, costs of,
 15 22 and oversight of the pilot programs and reporting requirements
 15 23 for participating counties. The DPH is directed to submit
 15 24 a report on the results of the pilot programs and make
 15 25 recommendations to the general assembly by December 15, 2018.

 10 13 appropriated to and shall be used by the department to assist
 10 14 indigent users of ignition interlock devices in paying for the
 10 15 use of the devices. Notwithstanding section 8.33, moneys in
 10 16 the fund at the end of each fiscal year shall not revert to any
 10 17 other fund but shall remain in the fund for expenditure for
 10 18 subsequent fiscal years.
 10 19    b.  Each month, the department shall assess an ignition
 10 20 interlock user fee to each user of an ignition interlock
 10 21 device. All ignition interlock user fees shall be collected by
 10 22 the department and deposited in the ignition interlock indigent
 10 23 user fund. The amount of the monthly ignition interlock user
 10 24 fee shall be set by the department so that the moneys in the
 10 25 ignition interlock indigent user fund are sufficient to assist
 10 26 all indigent users of ignition interlock devices in paying for
 10 27 the use of the devices.
 10 28    c.  A person is indigent for the purposes of this subsection
 10 29 if any of the following apply:
 10 30    (1)  The person has an income level at or below one hundred
 10 31 twenty=five percent of the United States poverty level as
 10 32 defined by the most recently revised poverty income guidelines
 10 33 published by the United States department of health and human
 10 34 services, and the department determines that the person is
 10 35 unable to pay for the cost of an ignition interlock device. In
 11  1 making the determination of a person's ability to pay for the
 11  2 cost of a device, the department shall consider not only the
 11  3 person's income, but also the person's other assets, including
 11  4 but not limited to cash, stocks, bonds, and any other property.
 11  5    (2)  The person has an income level greater than one hundred
 11  6 twenty=five percent, but at or below two hundred percent, of
 11  7 the most recently revised poverty income guidelines published
 11  8 by the United States department of health and human services,
 11  9 and the department determines that paying for the ignition
 11 10 interlock device would cause the person substantial hardship.
 11 11 In determining whether substantial hardship would result, the
 11 12 department shall consider not only the person's income, but
 11 13 also the person's other assets, including but not limited to
 11 14 cash, stocks, bonds, and any other property.
 11 15    d.  The department shall adopt rules to administer this
 11 16 subsection, including but not limited to the manner used to
 11 17 determine the monthly ignition interlock user fee and the
 11 18 accepted form and manner in which a person may demonstrate
 11 19 indigency.
 11 20    Sec. 15.  SOBRIETY MONITORING PILOT PROGRAMS.
 11 21    1.  The department of public health, in collaboration
 11 22 with the department of corrections, the department of public
 11 23 safety, and the department of transportation, may approve an
 11 24 application from a county for a countywide sobriety monitoring
 11 25 pilot program that is available twenty=four hours per day,
 11 26 seven days per week, in an effort to reduce the number of
 11 27 crimes related to operating while intoxicated. One application
 11 28 shall be approved for a county with a population of two hundred
 11 29 thousand people or more, one application shall be approved
 11 30 for a county with a population of one hundred thousand people
 11 31 or more but less than two hundred thousand people, and one
 11 32 application shall be approved for a county with a population of

 12 34    6.  The department of public health shall submit a report on
 12 35 the results of the pilot programs and make recommendations to
 13  1 the general assembly by December 15, 2018.
 13  2    7.  For the purposes of this section, "chemical substance"
 13  3 means alcohol, wine, spirits, and beer as defined in section
 13  4 123.3 and controlled substances as defined in section 124.101.
 13  5                           EXPLANATION
 13  6 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
 13  7 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
 13  8    Current law requires a person guilty of operating while
 13  9 intoxicated (OWI) to install an ignition interlock device in
 13 10 the person's vehicle if the person seeks a temporary restricted
 13 11 license, unless the person's alcohol concentration was less
 13 12 than .10 and no accident occurred. This bill strikes that
 13 13 exception, and also requires a person guilty of OWI to install
 13 14 an ignition interlock device in the person's vehicle upon the
 13 15 revocation of the person's driver's license rather than upon
 13 16 the person's application for a temporary restricted license.
 13 17    Under current law, an ignition interlock device is required
 13 18 to be installed in a person's vehicle for the period of time
 13 19 for which the person's temporary restricted license is issued,
 13 20 and up to one additional year after license reinstatement if
 13 21 the person has two or more OWI revocations. The bill requires
 13 22 the permanent installation of an ignition interlock device with
 13 23 two exceptions. If the ignition interlock device was installed
 13 24 as a result of the person's first OWI offense or revocation and
 13 25 a test was obtained, the device shall be uninstalled 180 days
 13 26 after the person's license was revoked, the person last failed
 13 27 a test by the ignition interlock device, or the defendant last
 13 28 failed to maintain the device as required, whichever is latest.
 13 29 If the ignition interlock device was installed as a result of
 13 30 the person's first OWI offense or revocation and a test was
 13 31 refused, the device shall be uninstalled 180 days after the
 13 32 person's license revocation period is over, the person last
 13 33 failed a test by the ignition interlock device, or the person
 13 34 last failed to maintain the device as required, whichever is
 13 35 latest.
 14  1 The bill provides an ignition interlock device shall not
 14  2 be uninstalled if the person has been convicted of a second
 14  3 or subsequent OWI violation, if the person's license has been
 14  4 revoked for a second or subsequent time, or if the person has
 14  5 been convicted of tampering with or circumventing an ignition
 14  6 interlock device.
 14  7    The bill requires the department of transportation (DOT)
 14  8 to assess a monthly ignition interlock user fee to each user
 14  9 of an ignition interlock device. All ignition interlock user
 14 10 fees will be collected by the DOT and deposited in an ignition
 14 11 interlock indigent user fund (IIIUF). The bill requires the
 14 12 DOT to use the moneys in the IIIUF to assist indigent users
 14 13 of ignition interlock devices in paying for the use of the
 14 14 devices. The amount of the monthly ignition interlock user fee
 14 15 shall be set by the DOT so that the moneys in the IIIUF are
 14 16 sufficient to assist all indigent users of ignition interlock
 14 17 devices in paying for the use of the devices.
 14 18    Under the bill, a person is indigent if the person has an
 14 19 income level at or below 125 percent of the U.S. poverty level
 14 20 and the person is unable to pay for the cost of an ignition
 14 21 interlock device. A person is also indigent if the person has
 14 22 an income level greater than 125 percent, but at or below 200
 14 23 percent, of the U.S. poverty level and paying for the ignition
 14 24 interlock device would cause the person substantial hardship.
 14 25    The bill provides for county sobriety monitoring pilot
 14 26 programs. The bill allows the department of public health

 15  1 application shall be approved for a county with a population of
 15  2 less than 100,000 people.
 15  3    The programs shall require individuals charged with or
 15  4 convicted of OWI to abstain from all chemical substances for
 15  5 a period of time. The programs are to require testing to

 12  1    a.  Require a person who has been charged with, pled guilty
 12  2 to, or been convicted of a violation of section 321J.2 to
 12  3 abstain from all chemical substances for a period of time.
 12  4    b.  Require the person to be subject to testing to determine
 12  5 whether a chemical substance is present in the person's body
 12  6 in the following manner:
 12  7    (1)  At least twice per day at a central location where an
 12  8 immediate sanction can be applied.
 12  9    (2)  Where testing under subparagraph (1) is impractical, by
 12 10 continuous transdermal or electronic monitoring.
 12 11    c.  Apply sanctions when test results definitively, and
 12 12 without presumption, indicate the presence of chemical
 12 13 substances.
 12 14    d.  Require a person participating in the program to pay
 12 15 program costs, including costs of installation, monitoring, and
 12 16 deactivation of any testing devices.
 12 17    e.  Require the person to install an ignition interlock
 12 18 device of a type approved by the commissioner of public safety
 12 19 on all vehicles owned or operated by the person, and require
 12 20 the person to pay the costs associated with the installation
 12 21 and use of the ignition interlock device.
 12 22    3.  A court in a county that has established a pilot program
 12 23 pursuant to this section may order a defendant, as a condition
 12 24 of pretrial release, probation, or bond, to participate in the
 12 25 program.
 12 26    4.  An approved pilot program shall begin on January 15,
 12 27 2017, or upon the effective date of department rules, whichever
 12 28 is earlier, and shall be conducted for a minimum of one year.
 12 29    5.  The department of public health shall adopt rules
 12 30 pursuant to chapter 17A to implement this section including
 12 31 but not limited to provisions relating to applications for,
 12 32 approval of, costs of, and oversight of the pilot programs and
 12 33 reporting requirements for participating counties.
 12 34    6.  The department of public health shall submit a report on
 12 35 the results of the pilot programs and make recommendations to
 13  1 the general assembly by December 15, 2018.
 13  2    7.  For the purposes of this section, "chemical substance"
 13  3 means alcohol, wine, spirits, and beer as defined in section
 13  4 123.3 and controlled substances as defined in section 124.101.
 13  5                           EXPLANATION
 13  6 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
 13  7 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
 13  8    Current law requires a person guilty of operating while
 13  9 intoxicated (OWI) to install an ignition interlock device in
 13 10 the person's vehicle if the person seeks a temporary restricted
 13 11 license, unless the person's alcohol concentration was less
 13 12 than .10 and no accident occurred. This bill strikes that
 13 13 exception, and also requires a person guilty of OWI to install
 13 14 an ignition interlock device in the person's vehicle upon the
 13 15 revocation of the person's driver's license rather than upon
 13 16 the person's application for a temporary restricted license.
 13 17    Under current law, an ignition interlock device is required
 13 18 to be installed in a person's vehicle for the period of time
 13 19 for which the person's temporary restricted license is issued,
 13 20 and up to one additional year after license reinstatement if
 13 21 the person has two or more OWI revocations. The bill requires
 13 22 the permanent installation of an ignition interlock device with
 13 23 two exceptions. If the ignition interlock device was installed
 13 24 as a result of the person's first OWI offense or revocation and
 13 25 a test was obtained, the device shall be uninstalled 180 days
 13 26 after the person's license was revoked, the person last failed
 13 27 a test by the ignition interlock device, or the defendant last
 13 28 failed to maintain the device as required, whichever is latest.
 13 29 If the ignition interlock device was installed as a result of
 13 30 the person's first OWI offense or revocation and a test was
 13 31 refused, the device shall be uninstalled 180 days after the
 13 32 person's license revocation period is over, the person last
 13 33 failed a test by the ignition interlock device, or the person
 13 34 last failed to maintain the device as required, whichever is
 13 35 latest.
 14  1 The bill provides an ignition interlock device shall not
 14  2 be uninstalled if the person has been convicted of a second
 14  3 or subsequent OWI violation, if the person's license has been
 14  4 revoked for a second or subsequent time, or if the person has
 14  5 been convicted of tampering with or circumventing an ignition
 14  6 interlock device.
 14  7    The bill requires the department of transportation (DOT)
 14  8 to assess a monthly ignition interlock user fee to each user
 14  9 of an ignition interlock device. All ignition interlock user
 14 10 fees will be collected by the DOT and deposited in an ignition
 14 11 interlock indigent user fund (IIIUF). The bill requires the
 14 12 DOT to use the moneys in the IIIUF to assist indigent users
 14 13 of ignition interlock devices in paying for the use of the
 14 14 devices. The amount of the monthly ignition interlock user fee
 14 15 shall be set by the DOT so that the moneys in the IIIUF are
 14 16 sufficient to assist all indigent users of ignition interlock
 14 17 devices in paying for the use of the devices.
 14 18    Under the bill, a person is indigent if the person has an
 14 19 income level at or below 125 percent of the U.S. poverty level
 14 20 and the person is unable to pay for the cost of an ignition
 14 21 interlock device. A person is also indigent if the person has
 14 22 an income level greater than 125 percent, but at or below 200
 14 23 percent, of the U.S. poverty level and paying for the ignition
 14 24 interlock device would cause the person substantial hardship.
 14 25    The bill provides for county sobriety monitoring pilot
 14 26 programs. The bill allows the department of public health
 14 27 (DPH), in collaboration with the department of corrections,
 14 28 the department of public safety, and the DOT, to approve
 14 29 applications from counties for countywide sobriety monitoring
 14 30 pilot programs. The programs are to be available 24 hours per
 14 31 day, seven days per week, in an effort to reduce the number
 14 32 of crimes related to OWI.  One application shall be approved
 14 33 for a county with a population of 200,000 people or more, one
 14 34 application shall be approved for a county with a population of
 14 35 100,000 people or more but less than 200,000 people, and one
 15  1 application shall be approved for a county with a population of
 15  2 less than 100,000 people.
 15  3    The programs shall require individuals charged with or
 15  4 convicted of OWI to abstain from all chemical substances for
 15  5 a period of time. The programs are to require testing to
 15  6 determine whether a chemical substance is present at least
 15  7 twice per day at a central location where an immediate sanction
 15  8 can be applied or, where such testing is impractical, by
 15  9 continuous transdermal or electronic monitoring. The programs
 15 10 shall also apply sanctions when test results definitively
 15 11 indicate the presence of a chemical substance. The programs
 15 12 shall require participants to pay program costs and to install
 15 13 an ignition interlock device.
 15 14    A court in a county that has established a pilot program
 15 15 may order a defendant, as a condition of pretrial release,
 15 16 probation, or bond, to participate in the program. Approved
 15 17 pilot programs shall begin January 15, 2017, or upon the
 15 18 effective date of DPH rules, whichever is earlier, and shall
 15 19 be conducted for a minimum of one year. The DPH is to adopt
 15 20 rules to implement the programs, including but not limited to
 15 21 provisions relating to applications for, approval of, costs of,
 15 22 and oversight of the pilot programs and reporting requirements
 15 23 for participating counties. The DPH is directed to submit
 15 24 a report on the results of the pilot programs and make
 15 25 recommendations to the general assembly by December 15, 2018.

 10 15 use of the devices. Notwithstanding section 8.33, moneys in
 10 16 the fund at the end of each fiscal year shall not revert to any
 10 17 other fund but shall remain in the fund for expenditure for
 10 18 subsequent fiscal years.
 10 19    b.  Each month, the department shall assess an ignition
 10 20 interlock user fee to each user of an ignition interlock
 10 21 device. All ignition interlock user fees shall be collected by
 10 22 the department and deposited in the ignition interlock indigent
 10 23 user fund. The amount of the monthly ignition interlock user
 10 24 fee shall be set by the department so that the moneys in the
 10 25 ignition interlock indigent user fund are sufficient to assist
 10 26 all indigent users of ignition interlock devices in paying for
 10 27 the use of the devices.
 10 28    c.  A person is indigent for the purposes of this subsection
 10 29 if any of the following apply:
 10 30    (1)  The person has an income level at or below one hundred
 10 31 twenty=five percent of the United States poverty level as
 10 32 defined by the most recently revised poverty income guidelines
 10 33 published by the United States department of health and human
 10 34 services, and the department determines that the person is
 10 35 unable to pay for the cost of an ignition interlock device. In
 11  1 making the determination of a person's ability to pay for the
 11  2 cost of a device, the department shall consider not only the
 11  3 person's income, but also the person's other assets, including
 11  4 but not limited to cash, stocks, bonds, and any other property.
 11  5    (2)  The person has an income level greater than one hundred
 11  6 twenty=five percent, but at or below two hundred percent, of
 11  7 the most recently revised poverty income guidelines published
 11  8 by the United States department of health and human services,
 11  9 and the department determines that paying for the ignition
 11 10 interlock device would cause the person substantial hardship.
 11 11 In determining whether substantial hardship would result, the
 11 12 department shall consider not only the person's income, but
 11 13 also the person's other assets, including but not limited to
 11 14 cash, stocks, bonds, and any other property.
 11 15    d.  The department shall adopt rules to administer this
 11 16 subsection, including but not limited to the manner used to
 11 17 determine the monthly ignition interlock user fee and the
 11 18 accepted form and manner in which a person may demonstrate
 11 19 indigency.
 11 20    Sec. 15.  SOBRIETY MONITORING PILOT PROGRAMS.
 11 21    1.  The department of public health, in collaboration
 11 22 with the department of corrections, the department of public
 11 23 safety, and the department of transportation, may approve an
 11 24 application from a county for a countywide sobriety monitoring
 11 25 pilot program that is available twenty=four hours per day,
 11 26 seven days per week, in an effort to reduce the number of
 11 27 crimes related to operating while intoxicated. One application
 11 28 shall be approved for a county with a population of two hundred
 11 29 thousand people or more, one application shall be approved
 11 30 for a county with a population of one hundred thousand people
 11 31 or more but less than two hundred thousand people, and one
 11 32 application shall be approved for a county with a population of
 11 33 less than one hundred thousand people.
 11 34    2.  A sobriety monitoring pilot program shall do all of the
 11 35 following:
 12  1    a.  Require a person who has been charged with, pled guilty
 12  2 to, or been convicted of a violation of section 321J.2 to
 12  3 abstain from all chemical substances for a period of time.
 12  4    b.  Require the person to be subject to testing to determine

 12 11    c.  Apply sanctions when test results definitively, and
 12 12 without presumption, indicate the presence of chemical
 12 13 substances.
 12 14    d.  Require a person participating in the program to pay
 12 15 program costs, including costs of installation, monitoring, and
 12 16 deactivation of any testing devices.
 12 17    e.  Require the person to install an ignition interlock
 12 18 device of a type approved by the commissioner of public safety
 12 19 on all vehicles owned or operated by the person, and require
 12 20 the person to pay the costs associated with the installation
 12 21 and use of the ignition interlock device.
 12 22    3.  A court in a county that has established a pilot program
 12 23 pursuant to this section may order a defendant, as a condition
 12 24 of pretrial release, probation, or bond, to participate in the
 12 25 program.
 12 26    4.  An approved pilot program shall begin on January 15,

 12 34    6.  The department of public health shall submit a report on
 12 35 the results of the pilot programs and make recommendations to
 13  1 the general assembly by December 15, 2018.
 13  2    7.  For the purposes of this section, "chemical substance"
 13  3 means alcohol, wine, spirits, and beer as defined in section
 13  4 123.3 and controlled substances as defined in section 124.101.
 13  5                           EXPLANATION
 13  6 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
 13  7 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
 13  8    Current law requires a person guilty of operating while
 13  9 intoxicated (OWI) to install an ignition interlock device in
 13 10 the person's vehicle if the person seeks a temporary restricted
 13 11 license, unless the person's alcohol concentration was less
 13 12 than .10 and no accident occurred. This bill strikes that
 13 13 exception, and also requires a person guilty of OWI to install
 13 14 an ignition interlock device in the person's vehicle upon the
 13 15 revocation of the person's driver's license rather than upon
 13 16 the person's application for a temporary restricted license.
 13 17    Under current law, an ignition interlock device is required
 13 18 to be installed in a person's vehicle for the period of time
 13 19 for which the person's temporary restricted license is issued,

 13 33 failed a test by the ignition interlock device, or the person
 13 34 last failed to maintain the device as required, whichever is
 13 35 latest.
 14  1 The bill provides an ignition interlock device shall not
 14  2 be uninstalled if the person has been convicted of a second
 14  3 or subsequent OWI violation, if the person's license has been
 14  4 revoked for a second or subsequent time, or if the person has
 14  5 been convicted of tampering with or circumventing an ignition
 14  6 interlock device.
 14  7    The bill requires the department of transportation (DOT)
 14  8 to assess a monthly ignition interlock user fee to each user
 14  9 of an ignition interlock device. All ignition interlock user
 14 10 fees will be collected by the DOT and deposited in an ignition
 14 11 interlock indigent user fund (IIIUF). The bill requires the
 14 12 DOT to use the moneys in the IIIUF to assist indigent users
 14 13 of ignition interlock devices in paying for the use of the
 14 14 devices. The amount of the monthly ignition interlock user fee
 14 15 shall be set by the DOT so that the moneys in the IIIUF are
 14 16 sufficient to assist all indigent users of ignition interlock
 14 17 devices in paying for the use of the devices.
 14 18    Under the bill, a person is indigent if the person has an
 14 19 income level at or below 125 percent of the U.S. poverty level
 14 20 and the person is unable to pay for the cost of an ignition
 14 21 interlock device. A person is also indigent if the person has
 14 22 an income level greater than 125 percent, but at or below 200
 14 23 percent, of the U.S. poverty level and paying for the ignition
 14 24 interlock device would cause the person substantial hardship.

 12 32 approval of, costs of, and oversight of the pilot programs and
 12 33 reporting requirements for participating counties.
 12 34    6.  The department of public health shall submit a report on
 12 35 the results of the pilot programs and make recommendations to
 13  1 the general assembly by December 15, 2018.
 13  2    7.  For the purposes of this section, "chemical substance"
 13  3 means alcohol, wine, spirits, and beer as defined in section
 13  4 123.3 and controlled substances as defined in section 124.101.
 13  5                           EXPLANATION
 13  6 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
 13  7 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
 13  8    Current law requires a person guilty of operating while
 13  9 intoxicated (OWI) to install an ignition interlock device in
 13 10 the person's vehicle if the person seeks a temporary restricted
 13 11 license, unless the person's alcohol concentration was less
 13 12 than .10 and no accident occurred. This bill strikes that
 13 13 exception, and also requires a person guilty of OWI to install
 13 14 an ignition interlock device in the person's vehicle upon the
 13 15 revocation of the person's driver's license rather than upon
 13 16 the person's application for a temporary restricted license.
 13 17    Under current law, an ignition interlock device is required
 13 18 to be installed in a person's vehicle for the period of time
 13 19 for which the person's temporary restricted license is issued,
 13 20 and up to one additional year after license reinstatement if
 13 21 the person has two or more OWI revocations. The bill requires
 13 22 the permanent installation of an ignition interlock device with
 13 23 two exceptions. If the ignition interlock device was installed
 13 24 as a result of the person's first OWI offense or revocation and
 13 25 a test was obtained, the device shall be uninstalled 180 days
 13 26 after the person's license was revoked, the person last failed
 13 27 a test by the ignition interlock device, or the defendant last
 13 28 failed to maintain the device as required, whichever is latest.
 13 29 If the ignition interlock device was installed as a result of
 13 30 the person's first OWI offense or revocation and a test was
 13 31 refused, the device shall be uninstalled 180 days after the
 13 32 person's license revocation period is over, the person last
 13 33 failed a test by the ignition interlock device, or the person
 13 34 last failed to maintain the device as required, whichever is
 13 35 latest.
 14  1 The bill provides an ignition interlock device shall not
 14  2 be uninstalled if the person has been convicted of a second
 14  3 or subsequent OWI violation, if the person's license has been
 14  4 revoked for a second or subsequent time, or if the person has
 14  5 been convicted of tampering with or circumventing an ignition
 14  6 interlock device.
 14  7    The bill requires the department of transportation (DOT)
 14  8 to assess a monthly ignition interlock user fee to each user
 14  9 of an ignition interlock device. All ignition interlock user
 14 10 fees will be collected by the DOT and deposited in an ignition
 14 11 interlock indigent user fund (IIIUF). The bill requires the
 14 12 DOT to use the moneys in the IIIUF to assist indigent users
 14 13 of ignition interlock devices in paying for the use of the
 14 14 devices. The amount of the monthly ignition interlock user fee
 14 15 shall be set by the DOT so that the moneys in the IIIUF are
 14 16 sufficient to assist all indigent users of ignition interlock
 14 17 devices in paying for the use of the devices.
 14 18    Under the bill, a person is indigent if the person has an
 14 19 income level at or below 125 percent of the U.S. poverty level
 14 20 and the person is unable to pay for the cost of an ignition
 14 21 interlock device. A person is also indigent if the person has
 14 22 an income level greater than 125 percent, but at or below 200
 14 23 percent, of the U.S. poverty level and paying for the ignition
 14 24 interlock device would cause the person substantial hardship.
 14 25    The bill provides for county sobriety monitoring pilot
 14 26 programs. The bill allows the department of public health
 14 27 (DPH), in collaboration with the department of corrections,
 14 28 the department of public safety, and the DOT, to approve
 14 29 applications from counties for countywide sobriety monitoring
 14 30 pilot programs. The programs are to be available 24 hours per
 14 31 day, seven days per week, in an effort to reduce the number
 14 32 of crimes related to OWI.  One application shall be approved
 14 33 for a county with a population of 200,000 people or more, one
 14 34 application shall be approved for a county with a population of
 14 35 100,000 people or more but less than 200,000 people, and one
 15  1 application shall be approved for a county with a population of
 15  2 less than 100,000 people.
 15  3    The programs shall require individuals charged with or
 15  4 convicted of OWI to abstain from all chemical substances for
 15  5 a period of time. The programs are to require testing to
 15  6 determine whether a chemical substance is present at least
 15  7 twice per day at a central location where an immediate sanction
 15  8 can be applied or, where such testing is impractical, by
 15  9 continuous transdermal or electronic monitoring. The programs
 15 10 shall also apply sanctions when test results definitively
 15 11 indicate the presence of a chemical substance. The programs
 15 12 shall require participants to pay program costs and to install
 15 13 an ignition interlock device.
 15 14    A court in a county that has established a pilot program
 15 15 may order a defendant, as a condition of pretrial release,
 15 16 probation, or bond, to participate in the program. Approved
 15 17 pilot programs shall begin January 15, 2017, or upon the
 15 18 effective date of DPH rules, whichever is earlier, and shall
 15 19 be conducted for a minimum of one year. The DPH is to adopt
 15 20 rules to implement the programs, including but not limited to
 15 21 provisions relating to applications for, approval of, costs of,
 15 22 and oversight of the pilot programs and reporting requirements
 15 23 for participating counties. The DPH is directed to submit
 15 24 a report on the results of the pilot programs and make
 15 25 recommendations to the general assembly by December 15, 2018.

 10 17 other fund but shall remain in the fund for expenditure for
 10 18 subsequent fiscal years.
 10 19    b.  Each month, the department shall assess an ignition
 10 20 interlock user fee to each user of an ignition interlock
 10 21 device. All ignition interlock user fees shall be collected by
 10 22 the department and deposited in the ignition interlock indigent
 10 23 user fund. The amount of the monthly ignition interlock user
 10 24 fee shall be set by the department so that the moneys in the
 10 25 ignition interlock indigent user fund are sufficient to assist
 10 26 all indigent users of ignition interlock devices in paying for
 10 27 the use of the devices.
 10 28    c.  A person is indigent for the purposes of this subsection
 10 29 if any of the following apply:
 10 30    (1)  The person has an income level at or below one hundred
 10 31 twenty=five percent of the United States poverty level as
 10 32 defined by the most recently revised poverty income guidelines
 10 33 published by the United States department of health and human
 10 34 services, and the department determines that the person is
 10 35 unable to pay for the cost of an ignition interlock device. In
 11  1 making the determination of a person's ability to pay for the
 11  2 cost of a device, the department shall consider not only the
 11  3 person's income, but also the person's other assets, including
 11  4 but not limited to cash, stocks, bonds, and any other property.
 11  5    (2)  The person has an income level greater than one hundred
 11  6 twenty=five percent, but at or below two hundred percent, of
 11  7 the most recently revised poverty income guidelines published
 11  8 by the United States department of health and human services,
 11  9 and the department determines that paying for the ignition
 11 10 interlock device would cause the person substantial hardship.
 11 11 In determining whether substantial hardship would result, the
 11 12 department shall consider not only the person's income, but
 11 13 also the person's other assets, including but not limited to
 11 14 cash, stocks, bonds, and any other property.
 11 15    d.  The department shall adopt rules to administer this
 11 16 subsection, including but not limited to the manner used to
 11 17 determine the monthly ignition interlock user fee and the
 11 18 accepted form and manner in which a person may demonstrate
 11 19 indigency.
 11 20    Sec. 15.  SOBRIETY MONITORING PILOT PROGRAMS.
 11 21    1.  The department of public health, in collaboration
 11 22 with the department of corrections, the department of public
 11 23 safety, and the department of transportation, may approve an
 11 24 application from a county for a countywide sobriety monitoring
 11 25 pilot program that is available twenty=four hours per day,
 11 26 seven days per week, in an effort to reduce the number of
 11 27 crimes related to operating while intoxicated. One application
 11 28 shall be approved for a county with a population of two hundred
 11 29 thousand people or more, one application shall be approved
 11 30 for a county with a population of one hundred thousand people
 11 31 or more but less than two hundred thousand people, and one
 11 32 application shall be approved for a county with a population of
 11 33 less than one hundred thousand people.
 11 34    2.  A sobriety monitoring pilot program shall do all of the
 11 35 following:
 12  1    a.  Require a person who has been charged with, pled guilty
 12  2 to, or been convicted of a violation of section 321J.2 to
 12  3 abstain from all chemical substances for a period of time.
 12  4    b.  Require the person to be subject to testing to determine
 12  5 whether a chemical substance is present in the person's body
 12  6 in the following manner:
 12  7    (1)  At least twice per day at a central location where an
 12  8 immediate sanction can be applied.
 12  9    (2)  Where testing under subparagraph (1) is impractical, by
 12 10 continuous transdermal or electronic monitoring.
 12 11    c.  Apply sanctions when test results definitively, and
 12 12 without presumption, indicate the presence of chemical
 12 13 substances.
 12 14    d.  Require a person participating in the program to pay
 12 15 program costs, including costs of installation, monitoring, and
 12 16 deactivation of any testing devices.
 12 17    e.  Require the person to install an ignition interlock
 12 18 device of a type approved by the commissioner of public safety
 12 19 on all vehicles owned or operated by the person, and require
 12 20 the person to pay the costs associated with the installation
 12 21 and use of the ignition interlock device.
 12 22    3.  A court in a county that has established a pilot program
 12 23 pursuant to this section may order a defendant, as a condition
 12 24 of pretrial release, probation, or bond, to participate in the
 12 25 program.
 12 26    4.  An approved pilot program shall begin on January 15,
 12 27 2017, or upon the effective date of department rules, whichever
 12 28 is earlier, and shall be conducted for a minimum of one year.
 12 29    5.  The department of public health shall adopt rules
 12 30 pursuant to chapter 17A to implement this section including

 13 30 the person's first OWI offense or revocation and a test was
 13 31 refused, the device shall be uninstalled 180 days after the
 13 32 person's license revocation period is over, the person last
 13 33 failed a test by the ignition interlock device, or the person
 13 34 last failed to maintain the device as required, whichever is
 13 35 latest.
 14  1 The bill provides an ignition interlock device shall not
 14  2 be uninstalled if the person has been convicted of a second
 14  3 or subsequent OWI violation, if the person's license has been
 14  4 revoked for a second or subsequent time, or if the person has
 14  5 been convicted of tampering with or circumventing an ignition
 14  6 interlock device.
 14  7    The bill requires the department of transportation (DOT)
 14  8 to assess a monthly ignition interlock user fee to each user
 14  9 of an ignition interlock device. All ignition interlock user
 14 10 fees will be collected by the DOT and deposited in an ignition
 14 11 interlock indigent user fund (IIIUF). The bill requires the
 14 12 DOT to use the moneys in the IIIUF to assist indigent users
 14 13 of ignition interlock devices in paying for the use of the
 14 14 devices. The amount of the monthly ignition interlock user fee
 14 15 shall be set by the DOT so that the moneys in the IIIUF are
 14 16 sufficient to assist all indigent users of ignition interlock
 14 17 devices in paying for the use of the devices.
 14 18    Under the bill, a person is indigent if the person has an
 14 19 income level at or below 125 percent of the U.S. poverty level
 14 20 and the person is unable to pay for the cost of an ignition
 14 21 interlock device. A person is also indigent if the person has
 14 22 an income level greater than 125 percent, but at or below 200
 14 23 percent, of the U.S. poverty level and paying for the ignition
 14 24 interlock device would cause the person substantial hardship.
 14 25    The bill provides for county sobriety monitoring pilot
 14 26 programs. The bill allows the department of public health
 14 27 (DPH), in collaboration with the department of corrections,
 14 28 the department of public safety, and the DOT, to approve
 14 29 applications from counties for countywide sobriety monitoring
 14 30 pilot programs. The programs are to be available 24 hours per
 14 31 day, seven days per week, in an effort to reduce the number
 14 32 of crimes related to OWI.  One application shall be approved
 14 33 for a county with a population of 200,000 people or more, one
 14 34 application shall be approved for a county with a population of
 14 35 100,000 people or more but less than 200,000 people, and one
 15  1 application shall be approved for a county with a population of
 15  2 less than 100,000 people.
 15  3    The programs shall require individuals charged with or
 15  4 convicted of OWI to abstain from all chemical substances for
 15  5 a period of time. The programs are to require testing to
 15  6 determine whether a chemical substance is present at least
 15  7 twice per day at a central location where an immediate sanction
 15  8 can be applied or, where such testing is impractical, by
 15  9 continuous transdermal or electronic monitoring. The programs
 15 10 shall also apply sanctions when test results definitively
 15 11 indicate the presence of a chemical substance. The programs
 15 12 shall require participants to pay program costs and to install
 15 13 an ignition interlock device.
 15 14    A court in a county that has established a pilot program
 15 15 may order a defendant, as a condition of pretrial release,
 15 16 probation, or bond, to participate in the program. Approved
 15 17 pilot programs shall begin January 15, 2017, or upon the
 15 18 effective date of DPH rules, whichever is earlier, and shall
 15 19 be conducted for a minimum of one year. The DPH is to adopt
 15 20 rules to implement the programs, including but not limited to
 15 21 provisions relating to applications for, approval of, costs of,
 15 22 and oversight of the pilot programs and reporting requirements
 15 23 for participating counties. The DPH is directed to submit
 15 24 a report on the results of the pilot programs and make
 15 25 recommendations to the general assembly by December 15, 2018.

 10 19    b.  Each month, the department shall assess an ignition
 10 20 interlock user fee to each user of an ignition interlock
 10 21 device. All ignition interlock user fees shall be collected by
 10 22 the department and deposited in the ignition interlock indigent
 10 23 user fund. The amount of the monthly ignition interlock user
 10 24 fee shall be set by the department so that the moneys in the
 10 25 ignition interlock indigent user fund are sufficient to assist
 10 26 all indigent users of ignition interlock devices in paying for
 10 27 the use of the devices.
 10 28    c.  A person is indigent for the purposes of this subsection
 10 29 if any of the following apply:
 10 30    (1)  The person has an income level at or below one hundred
 10 31 twenty=five percent of the United States poverty level as
 10 32 defined by the most recently revised poverty income guidelines
 10 33 published by the United States department of health and human
 10 34 services, and the department determines that the person is
 10 35 unable to pay for the cost of an ignition interlock device. In
 11  1 making the determination of a person's ability to pay for the
 11  2 cost of a device, the department shall consider not only the
 11  3 person's income, but also the person's other assets, including
 11  4 but not limited to cash, stocks, bonds, and any other property.
 11  5    (2)  The person has an income level greater than one hundred
 11  6 twenty=five percent, but at or below two hundred percent, of
 11  7 the most recently revised poverty income guidelines published
 11  8 by the United States department of health and human services,
 11  9 and the department determines that paying for the ignition
 11 10 interlock device would cause the person substantial hardship.
 11 11 In determining whether substantial hardship would result, the
 11 12 department shall consider not only the person's income, but
 11 13 also the person's other assets, including but not limited to
 11 14 cash, stocks, bonds, and any other property.
 11 15    d.  The department shall adopt rules to administer this
 11 16 subsection, including but not limited to the manner used to
 11 17 determine the monthly ignition interlock user fee and the
 11 18 accepted form and manner in which a person may demonstrate
 11 19 indigency.
 11 20    Sec. 15.  SOBRIETY MONITORING PILOT PROGRAMS.
 11 21    1.  The department of public health, in collaboration
 11 22 with the department of corrections, the department of public
 11 23 safety, and the department of transportation, may approve an
 11 24 application from a county for a countywide sobriety monitoring
 11 25 pilot program that is available twenty=four hours per day,
 11 26 seven days per week, in an effort to reduce the number of
 11 27 crimes related to operating while intoxicated. One application
 11 28 shall be approved for a county with a population of two hundred
 11 29 thousand people or more, one application shall be approved
 11 30 for a county with a population of one hundred thousand people
 11 31 or more but less than two hundred thousand people, and one
 11 32 application shall be approved for a county with a population of
 11 33 less than one hundred thousand people.
 11 34    2.  A sobriety monitoring pilot program shall do all of the
 11 35 following:
 12  1    a.  Require a person who has been charged with, pled guilty
 12  2 to, or been convicted of a violation of section 321J.2 to
 12  3 abstain from all chemical substances for a period of time.
 12  4    b.  Require the person to be subject to testing to determine
 12  5 whether a chemical substance is present in the person's body
 12  6 in the following manner:
 12  7    (1)  At least twice per day at a central location where an
 12  8 immediate sanction can be applied.
 12  9    (2)  Where testing under subparagraph (1) is impractical, by
 12 10 continuous transdermal or electronic monitoring.
 12 11    c.  Apply sanctions when test results definitively, and
 12 12 without presumption, indicate the presence of chemical
 12 13 substances.
 12 14    d.  Require a person participating in the program to pay
 12 15 program costs, including costs of installation, monitoring, and
 12 16 deactivation of any testing devices.
 12 17    e.  Require the person to install an ignition interlock
 12 18 device of a type approved by the commissioner of public safety
 12 19 on all vehicles owned or operated by the person, and require
 12 20 the person to pay the costs associated with the installation
 12 21 and use of the ignition interlock device.
 12 22    3.  A court in a county that has established a pilot program
 12 23 pursuant to this section may order a defendant, as a condition
 12 24 of pretrial release, probation, or bond, to participate in the
 12 25 program.
 12 26    4.  An approved pilot program shall begin on January 15,
 12 27 2017, or upon the effective date of department rules, whichever
 12 28 is earlier, and shall be conducted for a minimum of one year.
 12 29    5.  The department of public health shall adopt rules
 12 30 pursuant to chapter 17A to implement this section including
 12 31 but not limited to provisions relating to applications for,
 12 32 approval of, costs of, and oversight of the pilot programs and
 12 33 reporting requirements for participating counties.
 12 34    6.  The department of public health shall submit a report on
 12 35 the results of the pilot programs and make recommendations to
 13  1 the general assembly by December 15, 2018.
 13  2    7.  For the purposes of this section, "chemical substance"
 13  3 means alcohol, wine, spirits, and beer as defined in section
 13  4 123.3 and controlled substances as defined in section 124.101.
 13  5                           EXPLANATION
 13  6 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
 13  7 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
 13  8    Current law requires a person guilty of operating while
 13  9 intoxicated (OWI) to install an ignition interlock device in
 13 10 the person's vehicle if the person seeks a temporary restricted
 13 11 license, unless the person's alcohol concentration was less
 13 12 than .10 and no accident occurred. This bill strikes that
 13 13 exception, and also requires a person guilty of OWI to install
 13 14 an ignition interlock device in the person's vehicle upon the
 13 15 revocation of the person's driver's license rather than upon
 13 16 the person's application for a temporary restricted license.
 13 17    Under current law, an ignition interlock device is required
 13 18 to be installed in a person's vehicle for the period of time
 13 19 for which the person's temporary restricted license is issued,
 13 20 and up to one additional year after license reinstatement if
 13 21 the person has two or more OWI revocations. The bill requires
 13 22 the permanent installation of an ignition interlock device with
 13 23 two exceptions. If the ignition interlock device was installed
 13 24 as a result of the person's first OWI offense or revocation and
 13 25 a test was obtained, the device shall be uninstalled 180 days
 13 26 after the person's license was revoked, the person last failed
 13 27 a test by the ignition interlock device, or the defendant last
 13 28 failed to maintain the device as required, whichever is latest.
 13 29 If the ignition interlock device was installed as a result of
 13 30 the person's first OWI offense or revocation and a test was
 13 31 refused, the device shall be uninstalled 180 days after the
 13 32 person's license revocation period is over, the person last
 13 33 failed a test by the ignition interlock device, or the person
 13 34 last failed to maintain the device as required, whichever is
 13 35 latest.
 14  1 The bill provides an ignition interlock device shall not
 14  2 be uninstalled if the person has been convicted of a second
 14  3 or subsequent OWI violation, if the person's license has been
 14  4 revoked for a second or subsequent time, or if the person has
 14  5 been convicted of tampering with or circumventing an ignition
 14  6 interlock device.
 14  7    The bill requires the department of transportation (DOT)
 14  8 to assess a monthly ignition interlock user fee to each user
 14  9 of an ignition interlock device. All ignition interlock user
 14 10 fees will be collected by the DOT and deposited in an ignition
 14 11 interlock indigent user fund (IIIUF). The bill requires the
 14 12 DOT to use the moneys in the IIIUF to assist indigent users
 14 13 of ignition interlock devices in paying for the use of the
 14 14 devices. The amount of the monthly ignition interlock user fee
 14 15 shall be set by the DOT so that the moneys in the IIIUF are
 14 16 sufficient to assist all indigent users of ignition interlock
 14 17 devices in paying for the use of the devices.
 14 18    Under the bill, a person is indigent if the person has an
 14 19 income level at or below 125 percent of the U.S. poverty level
 14 20 and the person is unable to pay for the cost of an ignition
 14 21 interlock device. A person is also indigent if the person has
 14 22 an income level greater than 125 percent, but at or below 200
 14 23 percent, of the U.S. poverty level and paying for the ignition
 14 24 interlock device would cause the person substantial hardship.
 14 25    The bill provides for county sobriety monitoring pilot
 14 26 programs. The bill allows the department of public health
 14 27 (DPH), in collaboration with the department of corrections,
 14 28 the department of public safety, and the DOT, to approve

 14 30 pilot programs. The programs are to be available 24 hours per
 14 31 day, seven days per week, in an effort to reduce the number
 14 32 of crimes related to OWI.  One application shall be approved
 14 33 for a county with a population of 200,000 people or more, one
 14 34 application shall be approved for a county with a population of
 14 35 100,000 people or more but less than 200,000 people, and one
 15  1 application shall be approved for a county with a population of
 15  2 less than 100,000 people.
 15  3    The programs shall require individuals charged with or
 15  4 convicted of OWI to abstain from all chemical substances for
 15  5 a period of time. The programs are to require testing to
 15  6 determine whether a chemical substance is present at least
 15  7 twice per day at a central location where an immediate sanction

 15 10 shall also apply sanctions when test results definitively
 15 11 indicate the presence of a chemical substance. The programs
 15 12 shall require participants to pay program costs and to install
 15 13 an ignition interlock device.
 15 14    A court in a county that has established a pilot program
 15 15 may order a defendant, as a condition of pretrial release,

 15 17 pilot programs shall begin January 15, 2017, or upon the
 15 18 effective date of DPH rules, whichever is earlier, and shall
 15 19 be conducted for a minimum of one year. The DPH is to adopt
 15 20 rules to implement the programs, including but not limited to
 15 21 provisions relating to applications for, approval of, costs of,
 15 22 and oversight of the pilot programs and reporting requirements

 11  7 the most recently revised poverty income guidelines published
 11  8 by the United States department of health and human services,
 11  9 and the department determines that paying for the ignition
 11 10 interlock device would cause the person substantial hardship.
 11 11 In determining whether substantial hardship would result, the
 11 12 department shall consider not only the person's income, but
 11 13 also the person's other assets, including but not limited to

 11 20    Sec. 15.  SOBRIETY MONITORING PILOT PROGRAMS.
 11 21    1.  The department of public health, in collaboration
 11 22 with the department of corrections, the department of public
 11 23 safety, and the department of transportation, may approve an
 11 24 application from a county for a countywide sobriety monitoring

 12 34    6.  The department of public health shall submit a report on
 12 35 the results of the pilot programs and make recommendations to
 13  1 the general assembly by December 15, 2018.
 13  2    7.  For the purposes of this section, "chemical substance"
 13  3 means alcohol, wine, spirits, and beer as defined in section
 13  4 123.3 and controlled substances as defined in section 124.101.
 13  5                           EXPLANATION
 13  6 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
 13  7 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
 13  8    Current law requires a person guilty of operating while
 13  9 intoxicated (OWI) to install an ignition interlock device in
 13 10 the person's vehicle if the person seeks a temporary restricted
 13 11 license, unless the person's alcohol concentration was less
 13 12 than .10 and no accident occurred. This bill strikes that
 13 13 exception, and also requires a person guilty of OWI to install
 13 14 an ignition interlock device in the person's vehicle upon the
 13 15 revocation of the person's driver's license rather than upon
 13 16 the person's application for a temporary restricted license.
 13 17    Under current law, an ignition interlock device is required
 13 18 to be installed in a person's vehicle for the period of time
 13 19 for which the person's temporary restricted license is issued,
 13 20 and up to one additional year after license reinstatement if
 13 21 the person has two or more OWI revocations. The bill requires
 13 22 the permanent installation of an ignition interlock device with
 13 23 two exceptions. If the ignition interlock device was installed
 13 24 as a result of the person's first OWI offense or revocation and
 13 25 a test was obtained, the device shall be uninstalled 180 days
 13 26 after the person's license was revoked, the person last failed
 13 27 a test by the ignition interlock device, or the defendant last
 13 28 failed to maintain the device as required, whichever is latest.
 13 29 If the ignition interlock device was installed as a result of
 13 30 the person's first OWI offense or revocation and a test was
 13 31 refused, the device shall be uninstalled 180 days after the
 13 32 person's license revocation period is over, the person last
 13 33 failed a test by the ignition interlock device, or the person
 13 34 last failed to maintain the device as required, whichever is
 13 35 latest.
 14  1 The bill provides an ignition interlock device shall not
 14  2 be uninstalled if the person has been convicted of a second
 14  3 or subsequent OWI violation, if the person's license has been
 14  4 revoked for a second or subsequent time, or if the person has
 14  5 been convicted of tampering with or circumventing an ignition
 14  6 interlock device.
 14  7    The bill requires the department of transportation (DOT)
 14  8 to assess a monthly ignition interlock user fee to each user
 14  9 of an ignition interlock device. All ignition interlock user
 14 10 fees will be collected by the DOT and deposited in an ignition
 14 11 interlock indigent user fund (IIIUF). The bill requires the
 14 12 DOT to use the moneys in the IIIUF to assist indigent users
 14 13 of ignition interlock devices in paying for the use of the
 14 14 devices. The amount of the monthly ignition interlock user fee
 14 15 shall be set by the DOT so that the moneys in the IIIUF are
 14 16 sufficient to assist all indigent users of ignition interlock
 14 17 devices in paying for the use of the devices.
 14 18    Under the bill, a person is indigent if the person has an
 14 19 income level at or below 125 percent of the U.S. poverty level
 14 20 and the person is unable to pay for the cost of an ignition
 14 21 interlock device. A person is also indigent if the person has
 14 22 an income level greater than 125 percent, but at or below 200
 14 23 percent, of the U.S. poverty level and paying for the ignition
 14 24 interlock device would cause the person substantial hardship.
 14 25    The bill provides for county sobriety monitoring pilot
 14 26 programs. The bill allows the department of public health
 14 27 (DPH), in collaboration with the department of corrections,
 14 28 the department of public safety, and the DOT, to approve
 14 29 applications from counties for countywide sobriety monitoring
 14 30 pilot programs. The programs are to be available 24 hours per
 14 31 day, seven days per week, in an effort to reduce the number
 14 32 of crimes related to OWI.  One application shall be approved
 14 33 for a county with a population of 200,000 people or more, one
 14 34 application shall be approved for a county with a population of
 14 35 100,000 people or more but less than 200,000 people, and one
 15  1 application shall be approved for a county with a population of
 15  2 less than 100,000 people.
 15  3    The programs shall require individuals charged with or
 15  4 convicted of OWI to abstain from all chemical substances for
 15  5 a period of time. The programs are to require testing to
 15  6 determine whether a chemical substance is present at least
 15  7 twice per day at a central location where an immediate sanction
 15  8 can be applied or, where such testing is impractical, by
 15  9 continuous transdermal or electronic monitoring. The programs
 15 10 shall also apply sanctions when test results definitively
 15 11 indicate the presence of a chemical substance. The programs
 15 12 shall require participants to pay program costs and to install
 15 13 an ignition interlock device.
 15 14    A court in a county that has established a pilot program
 15 15 may order a defendant, as a condition of pretrial release,
 15 16 probation, or bond, to participate in the program. Approved
 15 17 pilot programs shall begin January 15, 2017, or upon the
 15 18 effective date of DPH rules, whichever is earlier, and shall
 15 19 be conducted for a minimum of one year. The DPH is to adopt
 15 20 rules to implement the programs, including but not limited to
 15 21 provisions relating to applications for, approval of, costs of,
 15 22 and oversight of the pilot programs and reporting requirements
 15 23 for participating counties. The DPH is directed to submit
 15 24 a report on the results of the pilot programs and make
 15 25 recommendations to the general assembly by December 15, 2018.

 10 22 the department and deposited in the ignition interlock indigent
 10 23 user fund. The amount of the monthly ignition interlock user
 10 24 fee shall be set by the department so that the moneys in the
 10 25 ignition interlock indigent user fund are sufficient to assist
 10 26 all indigent users of ignition interlock devices in paying for
 10 27 the use of the devices.
 10 28    c.  A person is indigent for the purposes of this subsection
 10 29 if any of the following apply:
 10 30    (1)  The person has an income level at or below one hundred
 10 31 twenty=five percent of the United States poverty level as
 10 32 defined by the most recently revised poverty income guidelines
 10 33 published by the United States department of health and human
 10 34 services, and the department determines that the person is
 10 35 unable to pay for the cost of an ignition interlock device. In
 11  1 making the determination of a person's ability to pay for the
 11  2 cost of a device, the department shall consider not only the
 11  3 person's income, but also the person's other assets, including
 11  4 but not limited to cash, stocks, bonds, and any other property.
 11  5    (2)  The person has an income level greater than one hundred
 11  6 twenty=five percent, but at or below two hundred percent, of
 11  7 the most recently revised poverty income guidelines published
 11  8 by the United States department of health and human services,
 11  9 and the department determines that paying for the ignition
 11 10 interlock device would cause the person substantial hardship.
 11 11 In determining whether substantial hardship would result, the
 11 12 department shall consider not only the person's income, but
 11 13 also the person's other assets, including but not limited to
 11 14 cash, stocks, bonds, and any other property.
 11 15    d.  The department shall adopt rules to administer this
 11 16 subsection, including but not limited to the manner used to
 11 17 determine the monthly ignition interlock user fee and the

 11 19 indigency.
 11 20    Sec. 15.  SOBRIETY MONITORING PILOT PROGRAMS.
 11 21    1.  The department of public health, in collaboration
 11 22 with the department of corrections, the department of public
 11 23 safety, and the department of transportation, may approve an
 11 24 application from a county for a countywide sobriety monitoring
 11 25 pilot program that is available twenty=four hours per day,
 11 26 seven days per week, in an effort to reduce the number of
 11 27 crimes related to operating while intoxicated. One application
 11 28 shall be approved for a county with a population of two hundred
 11 29 thousand people or more, one application shall be approved
 11 30 for a county with a population of one hundred thousand people
 11 31 or more but less than two hundred thousand people, and one
 11 32 application shall be approved for a county with a population of
 11 33 less than one hundred thousand people.
 11 34    2.  A sobriety monitoring pilot program shall do all of the
 11 35 following:
 12  1    a.  Require a person who has been charged with, pled guilty
 12  2 to, or been convicted of a violation of section 321J.2 to
 12  3 abstain from all chemical substances for a period of time.
 12  4    b.  Require the person to be subject to testing to determine
 12  5 whether a chemical substance is present in the person's body
 12  6 in the following manner:
 12  7    (1)  At least twice per day at a central location where an
 12  8 immediate sanction can be applied.
 12  9    (2)  Where testing under subparagraph (1) is impractical, by
 12 10 continuous transdermal or electronic monitoring.
 12 11    c.  Apply sanctions when test results definitively, and
 12 12 without presumption, indicate the presence of chemical
 12 13 substances.
 12 14    d.  Require a person participating in the program to pay
 12 15 program costs, including costs of installation, monitoring, and
 12 16 deactivation of any testing devices.
 12 17    e.  Require the person to install an ignition interlock
 12 18 device of a type approved by the commissioner of public safety
 12 19 on all vehicles owned or operated by the person, and require
 12 20 the person to pay the costs associated with the installation
 12 21 and use of the ignition interlock device.
 12 22    3.  A court in a county that has established a pilot program
 12 23 pursuant to this section may order a defendant, as a condition
 12 24 of pretrial release, probation, or bond, to participate in the
 12 25 program.
 12 26    4.  An approved pilot program shall begin on January 15,
 12 27 2017, or upon the effective date of department rules, whichever
 12 28 is earlier, and shall be conducted for a minimum of one year.
 12 29    5.  The department of public health shall adopt rules
 12 30 pursuant to chapter 17A to implement this section including
 12 31 but not limited to provisions relating to applications for,
 12 32 approval of, costs of, and oversight of the pilot programs and
 12 33 reporting requirements for participating counties.
 12 34    6.  The department of public health shall submit a report on
 12 35 the results of the pilot programs and make recommendations to
 13  1 the general assembly by December 15, 2018.
 13  2    7.  For the purposes of this section, "chemical substance"
 13  3 means alcohol, wine, spirits, and beer as defined in section
 13  4 123.3 and controlled substances as defined in section 124.101.
 13  5                           EXPLANATION
 13  6 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
 13  7 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
 13  8    Current law requires a person guilty of operating while
 13  9 intoxicated (OWI) to install an ignition interlock device in
 13 10 the person's vehicle if the person seeks a temporary restricted
 13 11 license, unless the person's alcohol concentration was less
 13 12 than .10 and no accident occurred. This bill strikes that
 13 13 exception, and also requires a person guilty of OWI to install
 13 14 an ignition interlock device in the person's vehicle upon the
 13 15 revocation of the person's driver's license rather than upon
 13 16 the person's application for a temporary restricted license.
 13 17    Under current law, an ignition interlock device is required
 13 18 to be installed in a person's vehicle for the period of time
 13 19 for which the person's temporary restricted license is issued,
 13 20 and up to one additional year after license reinstatement if
 13 21 the person has two or more OWI revocations. The bill requires
 13 22 the permanent installation of an ignition interlock device with
 13 23 two exceptions. If the ignition interlock device was installed
 13 24 as a result of the person's first OWI offense or revocation and
 13 25 a test was obtained, the device shall be uninstalled 180 days
 13 26 after the person's license was revoked, the person last failed
 13 27 a test by the ignition interlock device, or the defendant last
 13 28 failed to maintain the device as required, whichever is latest.
 13 29 If the ignition interlock device was installed as a result of
 13 30 the person's first OWI offense or revocation and a test was
 13 31 refused, the device shall be uninstalled 180 days after the
 13 32 person's license revocation period is over, the person last
 13 33 failed a test by the ignition interlock device, or the person
 13 34 last failed to maintain the device as required, whichever is
 13 35 latest.
 14  1 The bill provides an ignition interlock device shall not
 14  2 be uninstalled if the person has been convicted of a second
 14  3 or subsequent OWI violation, if the person's license has been
 14  4 revoked for a second or subsequent time, or if the person has
 14  5 been convicted of tampering with or circumventing an ignition
 14  6 interlock device.
 14  7    The bill requires the department of transportation (DOT)
 14  8 to assess a monthly ignition interlock user fee to each user
 14  9 of an ignition interlock device. All ignition interlock user
 14 10 fees will be collected by the DOT and deposited in an ignition
 14 11 interlock indigent user fund (IIIUF). The bill requires the
 14 12 DOT to use the moneys in the IIIUF to assist indigent users
 14 13 of ignition interlock devices in paying for the use of the
 14 14 devices. The amount of the monthly ignition interlock user fee
 14 15 shall be set by the DOT so that the moneys in the IIIUF are
 14 16 sufficient to assist all indigent users of ignition interlock
 14 17 devices in paying for the use of the devices.
 14 18    Under the bill, a person is indigent if the person has an
 14 19 income level at or below 125 percent of the U.S. poverty level
 14 20 and the person is unable to pay for the cost of an ignition
 14 21 interlock device. A person is also indigent if the person has
 14 22 an income level greater than 125 percent, but at or below 200
 14 23 percent, of the U.S. poverty level and paying for the ignition
 14 24 interlock device would cause the person substantial hardship.
 14 25    The bill provides for county sobriety monitoring pilot
 14 26 programs. The bill allows the department of public health
 14 27 (DPH), in collaboration with the department of corrections,
 14 28 the department of public safety, and the DOT, to approve
 14 29 applications from counties for countywide sobriety monitoring
 14 30 pilot programs. The programs are to be available 24 hours per
 14 31 day, seven days per week, in an effort to reduce the number
 14 32 of crimes related to OWI.  One application shall be approved
 14 33 for a county with a population of 200,000 people or more, one
 14 34 application shall be approved for a county with a population of
 14 35 100,000 people or more but less than 200,000 people, and one
 15  1 application shall be approved for a county with a population of
 15  2 less than 100,000 people.
 15  3    The programs shall require individuals charged with or
 15  4 convicted of OWI to abstain from all chemical substances for
 15  5 a period of time. The programs are to require testing to
 15  6 determine whether a chemical substance is present at least
 15  7 twice per day at a central location where an immediate sanction
 15  8 can be applied or, where such testing is impractical, by
 15  9 continuous transdermal or electronic monitoring. The programs
 15 10 shall also apply sanctions when test results definitively
 15 11 indicate the presence of a chemical substance. The programs
 15 12 shall require participants to pay program costs and to install
 15 13 an ignition interlock device.
 15 14    A court in a county that has established a pilot program
 15 15 may order a defendant, as a condition of pretrial release,
 15 16 probation, or bond, to participate in the program. Approved
 15 17 pilot programs shall begin January 15, 2017, or upon the
 15 18 effective date of DPH rules, whichever is earlier, and shall
 15 19 be conducted for a minimum of one year. The DPH is to adopt
 15 20 rules to implement the programs, including but not limited to
 15 21 provisions relating to applications for, approval of, costs of,
 15 22 and oversight of the pilot programs and reporting requirements
 15 23 for participating counties. The DPH is directed to submit
 15 24 a report on the results of the pilot programs and make

 11  1 making the determination of a person's ability to pay for the
 11  2 cost of a device, the department shall consider not only the
 11  3 person's income, but also the person's other assets, including
 11  4 but not limited to cash, stocks, bonds, and any other property.
 11  5    (2)  The person has an income level greater than one hundred
 11  6 twenty=five percent, but at or below two hundred percent, of
 11  7 the most recently revised poverty income guidelines published
 11  8 by the United States department of health and human services,
 11  9 and the department determines that paying for the ignition
 11 10 interlock device would cause the person substantial hardship.
 11 11 In determining whether substantial hardship would result, the
 11 12 department shall consider not only the person's income, but
 11 13 also the person's other assets, including but not limited to
 11 14 cash, stocks, bonds, and any other property.
 11 15    d.  The department shall adopt rules to administer this
 11 16 subsection, including but not limited to the manner used to
 11 17 determine the monthly ignition interlock user fee and the
 11 18 accepted form and manner in which a person may demonstrate
 11 19 indigency.
 11 20    Sec. 15.  SOBRIETY MONITORING PILOT PROGRAMS.
 11 21    1.  The department of public health, in collaboration
 11 22 with the department of corrections, the department of public
 11 23 safety, and the department of transportation, may approve an
 11 24 application from a county for a countywide sobriety monitoring
 11 25 pilot program that is available twenty=four hours per day,
 11 26 seven days per week, in an effort to reduce the number of
 11 27 crimes related to operating while intoxicated. One application
 11 28 shall be approved for a county with a population of two hundred
 11 29 thousand people or more, one application shall be approved
 11 30 for a county with a population of one hundred thousand people
 11 31 or more but less than two hundred thousand people, and one
 11 32 application shall be approved for a county with a population of
 11 33 less than one hundred thousand people.
 11 34    2.  A sobriety monitoring pilot program shall do all of the
 11 35 following:
 12  1    a.  Require a person who has been charged with, pled guilty
 12  2 to, or been convicted of a violation of section 321J.2 to
 12  3 abstain from all chemical substances for a period of time.
 12  4    b.  Require the person to be subject to testing to determine
 12  5 whether a chemical substance is present in the person's body
 12  6 in the following manner:
 12  7    (1)  At least twice per day at a central location where an
 12  8 immediate sanction can be applied.
 12  9    (2)  Where testing under subparagraph (1) is impractical, by
 12 10 continuous transdermal or electronic monitoring.
 12 11    c.  Apply sanctions when test results definitively, and
 12 12 without presumption, indicate the presence of chemical
 12 13 substances.
 12 14    d.  Require a person participating in the program to pay
 12 15 program costs, including costs of installation, monitoring, and
 12 16 deactivation of any testing devices.
 12 17    e.  Require the person to install an ignition interlock
 12 18 device of a type approved by the commissioner of public safety
 12 19 on all vehicles owned or operated by the person, and require
 12 20 the person to pay the costs associated with the installation
 12 21 and use of the ignition interlock device.
 12 22    3.  A court in a county that has established a pilot program
 12 23 pursuant to this section may order a defendant, as a condition
 12 24 of pretrial release, probation, or bond, to participate in the
 12 25 program.
 12 26    4.  An approved pilot program shall begin on January 15,
 12 27 2017, or upon the effective date of department rules, whichever
 12 28 is earlier, and shall be conducted for a minimum of one year.
 12 29    5.  The department of public health shall adopt rules
 12 30 pursuant to chapter 17A to implement this section including
 12 31 but not limited to provisions relating to applications for,
 12 32 approval of, costs of, and oversight of the pilot programs and
 12 33 reporting requirements for participating counties.
 12 34    6.  The department of public health shall submit a report on
 12 35 the results of the pilot programs and make recommendations to
 13  1 the general assembly by December 15, 2018.
 13  2    7.  For the purposes of this section, "chemical substance"
 13  3 means alcohol, wine, spirits, and beer as defined in section
 13  4 123.3 and controlled substances as defined in section 124.101.
 13  5                           EXPLANATION
 13  6 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
 13  7 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
 13  8    Current law requires a person guilty of operating while
 13  9 intoxicated (OWI) to install an ignition interlock device in
 13 10 the person's vehicle if the person seeks a temporary restricted
 13 11 license, unless the person's alcohol concentration was less
 13 12 than .10 and no accident occurred. This bill strikes that
 13 13 exception, and also requires a person guilty of OWI to install
 13 14 an ignition interlock device in the person's vehicle upon the
 13 15 revocation of the person's driver's license rather than upon
 13 16 the person's application for a temporary restricted license.
 13 17    Under current law, an ignition interlock device is required
 13 18 to be installed in a person's vehicle for the period of time
 13 19 for which the person's temporary restricted license is issued,
 13 20 and up to one additional year after license reinstatement if
 13 21 the person has two or more OWI revocations. The bill requires
 13 22 the permanent installation of an ignition interlock device with
 13 23 two exceptions. If the ignition interlock device was installed
 13 24 as a result of the person's first OWI offense or revocation and
 13 25 a test was obtained, the device shall be uninstalled 180 days
 13 26 after the person's license was revoked, the person last failed
 13 27 a test by the ignition interlock device, or the defendant last
 13 28 failed to maintain the device as required, whichever is latest.
 13 29 If the ignition interlock device was installed as a result of
 13 30 the person's first OWI offense or revocation and a test was
 13 31 refused, the device shall be uninstalled 180 days after the
 13 32 person's license revocation period is over, the person last
 13 33 failed a test by the ignition interlock device, or the person
 13 34 last failed to maintain the device as required, whichever is
 13 35 latest.
 14  1 The bill provides an ignition interlock device shall not
 14  2 be uninstalled if the person has been convicted of a second
 14  3 or subsequent OWI violation, if the person's license has been
 14  4 revoked for a second or subsequent time, or if the person has
 14  5 been convicted of tampering with or circumventing an ignition
 14  6 interlock device.
 14  7    The bill requires the department of transportation (DOT)
 14  8 to assess a monthly ignition interlock user fee to each user
 14  9 of an ignition interlock device. All ignition interlock user
 14 10 fees will be collected by the DOT and deposited in an ignition
 14 11 interlock indigent user fund (IIIUF). The bill requires the
 14 12 DOT to use the moneys in the IIIUF to assist indigent users
 14 13 of ignition interlock devices in paying for the use of the
 14 14 devices. The amount of the monthly ignition interlock user fee
 14 15 shall be set by the DOT so that the moneys in the IIIUF are
 14 16 sufficient to assist all indigent users of ignition interlock
 14 17 devices in paying for the use of the devices.
 14 18    Under the bill, a person is indigent if the person has an
 14 19 income level at or below 125 percent of the U.S. poverty level
 14 20 and the person is unable to pay for the cost of an ignition
 14 21 interlock device. A person is also indigent if the person has
 14 22 an income level greater than 125 percent, but at or below 200
 14 23 percent, of the U.S. poverty level and paying for the ignition
 14 24 interlock device would cause the person substantial hardship.
 14 25    The bill provides for county sobriety monitoring pilot
 14 26 programs. The bill allows the department of public health
 14 27 (DPH), in collaboration with the department of corrections,
 14 28 the department of public safety, and the DOT, to approve
 14 29 applications from counties for countywide sobriety monitoring
 14 30 pilot programs. The programs are to be available 24 hours per
 14 31 day, seven days per week, in an effort to reduce the number
 14 32 of crimes related to OWI.  One application shall be approved
 14 33 for a county with a population of 200,000 people or more, one
 14 34 application shall be approved for a county with a population of
 14 35 100,000 people or more but less than 200,000 people, and one
 15  1 application shall be approved for a county with a population of
 15  2 less than 100,000 people.
 15  3    The programs shall require individuals charged with or
 15  4 convicted of OWI to abstain from all chemical substances for
 15  5 a period of time. The programs are to require testing to
 15  6 determine whether a chemical substance is present at least
 15  7 twice per day at a central location where an immediate sanction
 15  8 can be applied or, where such testing is impractical, by
 15  9 continuous transdermal or electronic monitoring. The programs
 15 10 shall also apply sanctions when test results definitively
 15 11 indicate the presence of a chemical substance. The programs
 15 12 shall require participants to pay program costs and to install
 15 13 an ignition interlock device.
 15 14    A court in a county that has established a pilot program
 15 15 may order a defendant, as a condition of pretrial release,
 15 16 probation, or bond, to participate in the program. Approved
 15 17 pilot programs shall begin January 15, 2017, or upon the
 15 18 effective date of DPH rules, whichever is earlier, and shall
 15 19 be conducted for a minimum of one year. The DPH is to adopt
 15 20 rules to implement the programs, including but not limited to
 15 21 provisions relating to applications for, approval of, costs of,
 15 22 and oversight of the pilot programs and reporting requirements
 15 23 for participating counties. The DPH is directed to submit
 15 24 a report on the results of the pilot programs and make
 15 25 recommendations to the general assembly by December 15, 2018.

 10 33 published by the United States department of health and human
 10 34 services, and the department determines that the person is
 10 35 unable to pay for the cost of an ignition interlock device. In
 11  1 making the determination of a person's ability to pay for the
 11  2 cost of a device, the department shall consider not only the
 11  3 person's income, but also the person's other assets, including
 11  4 but not limited to cash, stocks, bonds, and any other property.
 11  5    (2)  The person has an income level greater than one hundred

 11 10 interlock device would cause the person substantial hardship.
 11 11 In determining whether substantial hardship would result, the
 11 12 department shall consider not only the person's income, but
 11 13 also the person's other assets, including but not limited to
 11 14 cash, stocks, bonds, and any other property.
 11 15    d.  The department shall adopt rules to administer this

 12 16 deactivation of any testing devices.
 12 17    e.  Require the person to install an ignition interlock
 12 18 device of a type approved by the commissioner of public safety
 12 19 on all vehicles owned or operated by the person, and require
 12 20 the person to pay the costs associated with the installation
 12 21 and use of the ignition interlock device.
 12 22    3.  A court in a county that has established a pilot program
 12 23 pursuant to this section may order a defendant, as a condition
 12 24 of pretrial release, probation, or bond, to participate in the
 12 25 program.
 12 26    4.  An approved pilot program shall begin on January 15,
 12 27 2017, or upon the effective date of department rules, whichever
 12 28 is earlier, and shall be conducted for a minimum of one year.
 12 29    5.  The department of public health shall adopt rules
 12 30 pursuant to chapter 17A to implement this section including
 12 31 but not limited to provisions relating to applications for,
 12 32 approval of, costs of, and oversight of the pilot programs and
 12 33 reporting requirements for participating counties.
 12 34    6.  The department of public health shall submit a report on
 12 35 the results of the pilot programs and make recommendations to
 13  1 the general assembly by December 15, 2018.
 13  2    7.  For the purposes of this section, "chemical substance"
 13  3 means alcohol, wine, spirits, and beer as defined in section
 13  4 123.3 and controlled substances as defined in section 124.101.
 13  5                           EXPLANATION
 13  6 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
 13  7 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
 13  8    Current law requires a person guilty of operating while
 13  9 intoxicated (OWI) to install an ignition interlock device in
 13 10 the person's vehicle if the person seeks a temporary restricted
 13 11 license, unless the person's alcohol concentration was less
 13 12 than .10 and no accident occurred. This bill strikes that
 13 13 exception, and also requires a person guilty of OWI to install
 13 14 an ignition interlock device in the person's vehicle upon the
 13 15 revocation of the person's driver's license rather than upon
 13 16 the person's application for a temporary restricted license.
 13 17    Under current law, an ignition interlock device is required
 13 18 to be installed in a person's vehicle for the period of time
 13 19 for which the person's temporary restricted license is issued,
 13 20 and up to one additional year after license reinstatement if
 13 21 the person has two or more OWI revocations. The bill requires
 13 22 the permanent installation of an ignition interlock device with
 13 23 two exceptions. If the ignition interlock device was installed
 13 24 as a result of the person's first OWI offense or revocation and
 13 25 a test was obtained, the device shall be uninstalled 180 days
 13 26 after the person's license was revoked, the person last failed
 13 27 a test by the ignition interlock device, or the defendant last
 13 28 failed to maintain the device as required, whichever is latest.
 13 29 If the ignition interlock device was installed as a result of
 13 30 the person's first OWI offense or revocation and a test was
 13 31 refused, the device shall be uninstalled 180 days after the
 13 32 person's license revocation period is over, the person last
 13 33 failed a test by the ignition interlock device, or the person
 13 34 last failed to maintain the device as required, whichever is
 13 35 latest.
 14  1 The bill provides an ignition interlock device shall not
 14  2 be uninstalled if the person has been convicted of a second
 14  3 or subsequent OWI violation, if the person's license has been
 14  4 revoked for a second or subsequent time, or if the person has
 14  5 been convicted of tampering with or circumventing an ignition
 14  6 interlock device.
 14  7    The bill requires the department of transportation (DOT)
 14  8 to assess a monthly ignition interlock user fee to each user
 14  9 of an ignition interlock device. All ignition interlock user
 14 10 fees will be collected by the DOT and deposited in an ignition
 14 11 interlock indigent user fund (IIIUF). The bill requires the
 14 12 DOT to use the moneys in the IIIUF to assist indigent users
 14 13 of ignition interlock devices in paying for the use of the
 14 14 devices. The amount of the monthly ignition interlock user fee
 14 15 shall be set by the DOT so that the moneys in the IIIUF are
 14 16 sufficient to assist all indigent users of ignition interlock
 14 17 devices in paying for the use of the devices.
 14 18    Under the bill, a person is indigent if the person has an
 14 19 income level at or below 125 percent of the U.S. poverty level
 14 20 and the person is unable to pay for the cost of an ignition
 14 21 interlock device. A person is also indigent if the person has
 14 22 an income level greater than 125 percent, but at or below 200
 14 23 percent, of the U.S. poverty level and paying for the ignition
 14 24 interlock device would cause the person substantial hardship.
 14 25    The bill provides for county sobriety monitoring pilot
 14 26 programs. The bill allows the department of public health
 14 27 (DPH), in collaboration with the department of corrections,
 14 28 the department of public safety, and the DOT, to approve
 14 29 applications from counties for countywide sobriety monitoring
 14 30 pilot programs. The programs are to be available 24 hours per
 14 31 day, seven days per week, in an effort to reduce the number
 14 32 of crimes related to OWI.  One application shall be approved
 14 33 for a county with a population of 200,000 people or more, one
 14 34 application shall be approved for a county with a population of
 14 35 100,000 people or more but less than 200,000 people, and one
 15  1 application shall be approved for a county with a population of
 15  2 less than 100,000 people.
 15  3    The programs shall require individuals charged with or
 15  4 convicted of OWI to abstain from all chemical substances for
 15  5 a period of time. The programs are to require testing to
 15  6 determine whether a chemical substance is present at least
 15  7 twice per day at a central location where an immediate sanction
 15  8 can be applied or, where such testing is impractical, by
 15  9 continuous transdermal or electronic monitoring. The programs
 15 10 shall also apply sanctions when test results definitively
 15 11 indicate the presence of a chemical substance. The programs
 15 12 shall require participants to pay program costs and to install
 15 13 an ignition interlock device.
 15 14    A court in a county that has established a pilot program
 15 15 may order a defendant, as a condition of pretrial release,
 15 16 probation, or bond, to participate in the program. Approved
 15 17 pilot programs shall begin January 15, 2017, or upon the
 15 18 effective date of DPH rules, whichever is earlier, and shall
 15 19 be conducted for a minimum of one year. The DPH is to adopt
 15 20 rules to implement the programs, including but not limited to
 15 21 provisions relating to applications for, approval of, costs of,
 15 22 and oversight of the pilot programs and reporting requirements
 15 23 for participating counties. The DPH is directed to submit
 15 24 a report on the results of the pilot programs and make
 15 25 recommendations to the general assembly by December 15, 2018.

 10 26 all indigent users of ignition interlock devices in paying for
 10 27 the use of the devices.
 10 28    c.  A person is indigent for the purposes of this subsection
 10 29 if any of the following apply:
 10 30    (1)  The person has an income level at or below one hundred
 10 31 twenty=five percent of the United States poverty level as
 10 32 defined by the most recently revised poverty income guidelines
 10 33 published by the United States department of health and human
 10 34 services, and the department determines that the person is
 10 35 unable to pay for the cost of an ignition interlock device. In
 11  1 making the determination of a person's ability to pay for the
 11  2 cost of a device, the department shall consider not only the
 11  3 person's income, but also the person's other assets, including
 11  4 but not limited to cash, stocks, bonds, and any other property.
 11  5    (2)  The person has an income level greater than one hundred
 11  6 twenty=five percent, but at or below two hundred percent, of
 11  7 the most recently revised poverty income guidelines published
 11  8 by the United States department of health and human services,
 11  9 and the department determines that paying for the ignition
 11 10 interlock device would cause the person substantial hardship.
 11 11 In determining whether substantial hardship would result, the
 11 12 department shall consider not only the person's income, but
 11 13 also the person's other assets, including but not limited to
 11 14 cash, stocks, bonds, and any other property.
 11 15    d.  The department shall adopt rules to administer this
 11 16 subsection, including but not limited to the manner used to
 11 17 determine the monthly ignition interlock user fee and the
 11 18 accepted form and manner in which a person may demonstrate
 11 19 indigency.
 11 20    Sec. 15.  SOBRIETY MONITORING PILOT PROGRAMS.
 11 21    1.  The department of public health, in collaboration
 11 22 with the department of corrections, the department of public
 11 23 safety, and the department of transportation, may approve an
 11 24 application from a county for a countywide sobriety monitoring
 11 25 pilot program that is available twenty=four hours per day,
 11 26 seven days per week, in an effort to reduce the number of
 11 27 crimes related to operating while intoxicated. One application
 11 28 shall be approved for a county with a population of two hundred
 11 29 thousand people or more, one application shall be approved
 11 30 for a county with a population of one hundred thousand people
 11 31 or more but less than two hundred thousand people, and one
 11 32 application shall be approved for a county with a population of
 11 33 less than one hundred thousand people.
 11 34    2.  A sobriety monitoring pilot program shall do all of the
 11 35 following:
 12  1    a.  Require a person who has been charged with, pled guilty
 12  2 to, or been convicted of a violation of section 321J.2 to
 12  3 abstain from all chemical substances for a period of time.
 12  4    b.  Require the person to be subject to testing to determine
 12  5 whether a chemical substance is present in the person's body
 12  6 in the following manner:
 12  7    (1)  At least twice per day at a central location where an
 12  8 immediate sanction can be applied.
 12  9    (2)  Where testing under subparagraph (1) is impractical, by
 12 10 continuous transdermal or electronic monitoring.
 12 11    c.  Apply sanctions when test results definitively, and
 12 12 without presumption, indicate the presence of chemical
 12 13 substances.
 12 14    d.  Require a person participating in the program to pay
 12 15 program costs, including costs of installation, monitoring, and
 12 16 deactivation of any testing devices.
 12 17    e.  Require the person to install an ignition interlock
 12 18 device of a type approved by the commissioner of public safety
 12 19 on all vehicles owned or operated by the person, and require

 12 21 and use of the ignition interlock device.
 12 22    3.  A court in a county that has established a pilot program
 12 23 pursuant to this section may order a defendant, as a condition
 12 24 of pretrial release, probation, or bond, to participate in the
 12 25 program.
 12 26    4.  An approved pilot program shall begin on January 15,
 12 27 2017, or upon the effective date of department rules, whichever
 12 28 is earlier, and shall be conducted for a minimum of one year.
 12 29    5.  The department of public health shall adopt rules
 12 30 pursuant to chapter 17A to implement this section including
 12 31 but not limited to provisions relating to applications for,
 12 32 approval of, costs of, and oversight of the pilot programs and
 12 33 reporting requirements for participating counties.
 12 34    6.  The department of public health shall submit a report on
 12 35 the results of the pilot programs and make recommendations to
 13  1 the general assembly by December 15, 2018.
 13  2    7.  For the purposes of this section, "chemical substance"
 13  3 means alcohol, wine, spirits, and beer as defined in section
 13  4 123.3 and controlled substances as defined in section 124.101.
 13  5                           EXPLANATION
 13  6 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
 13  7 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
 13  8    Current law requires a person guilty of operating while
 13  9 intoxicated (OWI) to install an ignition interlock device in
 13 10 the person's vehicle if the person seeks a temporary restricted
 13 11 license, unless the person's alcohol concentration was less
 13 12 than .10 and no accident occurred. This bill strikes that
 13 13 exception, and also requires a person guilty of OWI to install
 13 14 an ignition interlock device in the person's vehicle upon the
 13 15 revocation of the person's driver's license rather than upon

 13 17    Under current law, an ignition interlock device is required
 13 18 to be installed in a person's vehicle for the period of time
 13 19 for which the person's temporary restricted license is issued,

 13 27 a test by the ignition interlock device, or the defendant last
 13 28 failed to maintain the device as required, whichever is latest.
 13 29 If the ignition interlock device was installed as a result of

 13 32 person's license revocation period is over, the person last
 13 33 failed a test by the ignition interlock device, or the person
 13 34 last failed to maintain the device as required, whichever is
 13 35 latest.
 14  1 The bill provides an ignition interlock device shall not
 14  2 be uninstalled if the person has been convicted of a second
 14  3 or subsequent OWI violation, if the person's license has been
 14  4 revoked for a second or subsequent time, or if the person has

 14  7    The bill requires the department of transportation (DOT)
 14  8 to assess a monthly ignition interlock user fee to each user
 14  9 of an ignition interlock device. All ignition interlock user
 14 10 fees will be collected by the DOT and deposited in an ignition

 14 12 DOT to use the moneys in the IIIUF to assist indigent users
 14 13 of ignition interlock devices in paying for the use of the
 14 14 devices. The amount of the monthly ignition interlock user fee
 14 15 shall be set by the DOT so that the moneys in the IIIUF are
 14 16 sufficient to assist all indigent users of ignition interlock
 14 17 devices in paying for the use of the devices.
 14 18    Under the bill, a person is indigent if the person has an
 14 19 income level at or below 125 percent of the U.S. poverty level
 14 20 and the person is unable to pay for the cost of an ignition
 14 21 interlock device. A person is also indigent if the person has
 14 22 an income level greater than 125 percent, but at or below 200
 14 23 percent, of the U.S. poverty level and paying for the ignition
 14 24 interlock device would cause the person substantial hardship.

 12 21 and use of the ignition interlock device.
 12 22    3.  A court in a county that has established a pilot program
 12 23 pursuant to this section may order a defendant, as a condition
 12 24 of pretrial release, probation, or bond, to participate in the
 12 25 program.
 12 26    4.  An approved pilot program shall begin on January 15,

 12 34    6.  The department of public health shall submit a report on
 12 35 the results of the pilot programs and make recommendations to
 13  1 the general assembly by December 15, 2018.
 13  2    7.  For the purposes of this section, "chemical substance"
 13  3 means alcohol, wine, spirits, and beer as defined in section
 13  4 123.3 and controlled substances as defined in section 124.101.
 13  5                           EXPLANATION
 13  6 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
 13  7 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
 13  8    Current law requires a person guilty of operating while
 13  9 intoxicated (OWI) to install an ignition interlock device in
 13 10 the person's vehicle if the person seeks a temporary restricted
 13 11 license, unless the person's alcohol concentration was less
 13 12 than .10 and no accident occurred. This bill strikes that
 13 13 exception, and also requires a person guilty of OWI to install
 13 14 an ignition interlock device in the person's vehicle upon the
 13 15 revocation of the person's driver's license rather than upon
 13 16 the person's application for a temporary restricted license.
 13 17    Under current law, an ignition interlock device is required
 13 18 to be installed in a person's vehicle for the period of time
 13 19 for which the person's temporary restricted license is issued,
 13 20 and up to one additional year after license reinstatement if
 13 21 the person has two or more OWI revocations. The bill requires
 13 22 the permanent installation of an ignition interlock device with
 13 23 two exceptions. If the ignition interlock device was installed
 13 24 as a result of the person's first OWI offense or revocation and
 13 25 a test was obtained, the device shall be uninstalled 180 days
 13 26 after the person's license was revoked, the person last failed
 13 27 a test by the ignition interlock device, or the defendant last
 13 28 failed to maintain the device as required, whichever is latest.
 13 29 If the ignition interlock device was installed as a result of
 13 30 the person's first OWI offense or revocation and a test was
 13 31 refused, the device shall be uninstalled 180 days after the
 13 32 person's license revocation period is over, the person last
 13 33 failed a test by the ignition interlock device, or the person
 13 34 last failed to maintain the device as required, whichever is
 13 35 latest.
 14  1 The bill provides an ignition interlock device shall not
 14  2 be uninstalled if the person has been convicted of a second
 14  3 or subsequent OWI violation, if the person's license has been
 14  4 revoked for a second or subsequent time, or if the person has
 14  5 been convicted of tampering with or circumventing an ignition
 14  6 interlock device.
 14  7    The bill requires the department of transportation (DOT)
 14  8 to assess a monthly ignition interlock user fee to each user
 14  9 of an ignition interlock device. All ignition interlock user
 14 10 fees will be collected by the DOT and deposited in an ignition
 14 11 interlock indigent user fund (IIIUF). The bill requires the
 14 12 DOT to use the moneys in the IIIUF to assist indigent users
 14 13 of ignition interlock devices in paying for the use of the
 14 14 devices. The amount of the monthly ignition interlock user fee
 14 15 shall be set by the DOT so that the moneys in the IIIUF are
 14 16 sufficient to assist all indigent users of ignition interlock
 14 17 devices in paying for the use of the devices.
 14 18    Under the bill, a person is indigent if the person has an
 14 19 income level at or below 125 percent of the U.S. poverty level
 14 20 and the person is unable to pay for the cost of an ignition
 14 21 interlock device. A person is also indigent if the person has
 14 22 an income level greater than 125 percent, but at or below 200
 14 23 percent, of the U.S. poverty level and paying for the ignition
 14 24 interlock device would cause the person substantial hardship.
 14 25    The bill provides for county sobriety monitoring pilot
 14 26 programs. The bill allows the department of public health
 14 27 (DPH), in collaboration with the department of corrections,
 14 28 the department of public safety, and the DOT, to approve
 14 29 applications from counties for countywide sobriety monitoring
 14 30 pilot programs. The programs are to be available 24 hours per
 14 31 day, seven days per week, in an effort to reduce the number
 14 32 of crimes related to OWI.  One application shall be approved
 14 33 for a county with a population of 200,000 people or more, one
 14 34 application shall be approved for a county with a population of
 14 35 100,000 people or more but less than 200,000 people, and one
 15  1 application shall be approved for a county with a population of
 15  2 less than 100,000 people.
 15  3    The programs shall require individuals charged with or
 15  4 convicted of OWI to abstain from all chemical substances for
 15  5 a period of time. The programs are to require testing to
 15  6 determine whether a chemical substance is present at least
 15  7 twice per day at a central location where an immediate sanction
 15  8 can be applied or, where such testing is impractical, by
 15  9 continuous transdermal or electronic monitoring. The programs
 15 10 shall also apply sanctions when test results definitively
 15 11 indicate the presence of a chemical substance. The programs
 15 12 shall require participants to pay program costs and to install
 15 13 an ignition interlock device.
 15 14    A court in a county that has established a pilot program
 15 15 may order a defendant, as a condition of pretrial release,
 15 16 probation, or bond, to participate in the program. Approved
 15 17 pilot programs shall begin January 15, 2017, or upon the
 15 18 effective date of DPH rules, whichever is earlier, and shall
 15 19 be conducted for a minimum of one year. The DPH is to adopt
 15 20 rules to implement the programs, including but not limited to
 15 21 provisions relating to applications for, approval of, costs of,
 15 22 and oversight of the pilot programs and reporting requirements
 15 23 for participating counties. The DPH is directed to submit
 15 24 a report on the results of the pilot programs and make
 15 25 recommendations to the general assembly by December 15, 2018.

 10 28    c.  A person is indigent for the purposes of this subsection
 10 29 if any of the following apply:
 10 30    (1)  The person has an income level at or below one hundred
 10 31 twenty=five percent of the United States poverty level as
 10 32 defined by the most recently revised poverty income guidelines
 10 33 published by the United States department of health and human
 10 34 services, and the department determines that the person is
 10 35 unable to pay for the cost of an ignition interlock device. In
 11  1 making the determination of a person's ability to pay for the
 11  2 cost of a device, the department shall consider not only the
 11  3 person's income, but also the person's other assets, including
 11  4 but not limited to cash, stocks, bonds, and any other property.
 11  5    (2)  The person has an income level greater than one hundred
 11  6 twenty=five percent, but at or below two hundred percent, of
 11  7 the most recently revised poverty income guidelines published
 11  8 by the United States department of health and human services,
 11  9 and the department determines that paying for the ignition
 11 10 interlock device would cause the person substantial hardship.
 11 11 In determining whether substantial hardship would result, the
 11 12 department shall consider not only the person's income, but
 11 13 also the person's other assets, including but not limited to
 11 14 cash, stocks, bonds, and any other property.
 11 15    d.  The department shall adopt rules to administer this
 11 16 subsection, including but not limited to the manner used to
 11 17 determine the monthly ignition interlock user fee and the
 11 18 accepted form and manner in which a person may demonstrate
 11 19 indigency.
 11 20    Sec. 15.  SOBRIETY MONITORING PILOT PROGRAMS.
 11 21    1.  The department of public health, in collaboration
 11 22 with the department of corrections, the department of public
 11 23 safety, and the department of transportation, may approve an
 11 24 application from a county for a countywide sobriety monitoring
 11 25 pilot program that is available twenty=four hours per day,
 11 26 seven days per week, in an effort to reduce the number of
 11 27 crimes related to operating while intoxicated. One application
 11 28 shall be approved for a county with a population of two hundred
 11 29 thousand people or more, one application shall be approved
 11 30 for a county with a population of one hundred thousand people
 11 31 or more but less than two hundred thousand people, and one
 11 32 application shall be approved for a county with a population of
 11 33 less than one hundred thousand people.
 11 34    2.  A sobriety monitoring pilot program shall do all of the
 11 35 following:
 12  1    a.  Require a person who has been charged with, pled guilty
 12  2 to, or been convicted of a violation of section 321J.2 to
 12  3 abstain from all chemical substances for a period of time.
 12  4    b.  Require the person to be subject to testing to determine
 12  5 whether a chemical substance is present in the person's body
 12  6 in the following manner:
 12  7    (1)  At least twice per day at a central location where an
 12  8 immediate sanction can be applied.
 12  9    (2)  Where testing under subparagraph (1) is impractical, by
 12 10 continuous transdermal or electronic monitoring.
 12 11    c.  Apply sanctions when test results definitively, and
 12 12 without presumption, indicate the presence of chemical
 12 13 substances.
 12 14    d.  Require a person participating in the program to pay
 12 15 program costs, including costs of installation, monitoring, and
 12 16 deactivation of any testing devices.
 12 17    e.  Require the person to install an ignition interlock
 12 18 device of a type approved by the commissioner of public safety
 12 19 on all vehicles owned or operated by the person, and require
 12 20 the person to pay the costs associated with the installation
 12 21 and use of the ignition interlock device.
 12 22    3.  A court in a county that has established a pilot program
 12 23 pursuant to this section may order a defendant, as a condition
 12 24 of pretrial release, probation, or bond, to participate in the
 12 25 program.
 12 26    4.  An approved pilot program shall begin on January 15,
 12 27 2017, or upon the effective date of department rules, whichever
 12 28 is earlier, and shall be conducted for a minimum of one year.
 12 29    5.  The department of public health shall adopt rules
 12 30 pursuant to chapter 17A to implement this section including
 12 31 but not limited to provisions relating to applications for,
 12 32 approval of, costs of, and oversight of the pilot programs and
 12 33 reporting requirements for participating counties.
 12 34    6.  The department of public health shall submit a report on
 12 35 the results of the pilot programs and make recommendations to
 13  1 the general assembly by December 15, 2018.
 13  2    7.  For the purposes of this section, "chemical substance"
 13  3 means alcohol, wine, spirits, and beer as defined in section
 13  4 123.3 and controlled substances as defined in section 124.101.
 13  5                           EXPLANATION
 13  6 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
 13  7 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
 13  8    Current law requires a person guilty of operating while
 13  9 intoxicated (OWI) to install an ignition interlock device in
 13 10 the person's vehicle if the person seeks a temporary restricted
 13 11 license, unless the person's alcohol concentration was less
 13 12 than .10 and no accident occurred. This bill strikes that
 13 13 exception, and also requires a person guilty of OWI to install
 13 14 an ignition interlock device in the person's vehicle upon the
 13 15 revocation of the person's driver's license rather than upon
 13 16 the person's application for a temporary restricted license.
 13 17    Under current law, an ignition interlock device is required
 13 18 to be installed in a person's vehicle for the period of time
 13 19 for which the person's temporary restricted license is issued,
 13 20 and up to one additional year after license reinstatement if
 13 21 the person has two or more OWI revocations. The bill requires
 13 22 the permanent installation of an ignition interlock device with
 13 23 two exceptions. If the ignition interlock device was installed
 13 24 as a result of the person's first OWI offense or revocation and
 13 25 a test was obtained, the device shall be uninstalled 180 days
 13 26 after the person's license was revoked, the person last failed
 13 27 a test by the ignition interlock device, or the defendant last
 13 28 failed to maintain the device as required, whichever is latest.
 13 29 If the ignition interlock device was installed as a result of
 13 30 the person's first OWI offense or revocation and a test was
 13 31 refused, the device shall be uninstalled 180 days after the
 13 32 person's license revocation period is over, the person last
 13 33 failed a test by the ignition interlock device, or the person
 13 34 last failed to maintain the device as required, whichever is
 13 35 latest.
 14  1 The bill provides an ignition interlock device shall not
 14  2 be uninstalled if the person has been convicted of a second
 14  3 or subsequent OWI violation, if the person's license has been
 14  4 revoked for a second or subsequent time, or if the person has
 14  5 been convicted of tampering with or circumventing an ignition
 14  6 interlock device.
 14  7    The bill requires the department of transportation (DOT)
 14  8 to assess a monthly ignition interlock user fee to each user
 14  9 of an ignition interlock device. All ignition interlock user
 14 10 fees will be collected by the DOT and deposited in an ignition
 14 11 interlock indigent user fund (IIIUF). The bill requires the
 14 12 DOT to use the moneys in the IIIUF to assist indigent users
 14 13 of ignition interlock devices in paying for the use of the
 14 14 devices. The amount of the monthly ignition interlock user fee
 14 15 shall be set by the DOT so that the moneys in the IIIUF are
 14 16 sufficient to assist all indigent users of ignition interlock
 14 17 devices in paying for the use of the devices.
 14 18    Under the bill, a person is indigent if the person has an
 14 19 income level at or below 125 percent of the U.S. poverty level
 14 20 and the person is unable to pay for the cost of an ignition
 14 21 interlock device. A person is also indigent if the person has
 14 22 an income level greater than 125 percent, but at or below 200
 14 23 percent, of the U.S. poverty level and paying for the ignition
 14 24 interlock device would cause the person substantial hardship.
 14 25    The bill provides for county sobriety monitoring pilot
 14 26 programs. The bill allows the department of public health
 14 27 (DPH), in collaboration with the department of corrections,
 14 28 the department of public safety, and the DOT, to approve
 14 29 applications from counties for countywide sobriety monitoring
 14 30 pilot programs. The programs are to be available 24 hours per
 14 31 day, seven days per week, in an effort to reduce the number
 14 32 of crimes related to OWI.  One application shall be approved
 14 33 for a county with a population of 200,000 people or more, one
 14 34 application shall be approved for a county with a population of
 14 35 100,000 people or more but less than 200,000 people, and one
 15  1 application shall be approved for a county with a population of
 15  2 less than 100,000 people.
 15  3    The programs shall require individuals charged with or
 15  4 convicted of OWI to abstain from all chemical substances for
 15  5 a period of time. The programs are to require testing to
 15  6 determine whether a chemical substance is present at least
 15  7 twice per day at a central location where an immediate sanction
 15  8 can be applied or, where such testing is impractical, by
 15  9 continuous transdermal or electronic monitoring. The programs
 15 10 shall also apply sanctions when test results definitively
 15 11 indicate the presence of a chemical substance. The programs
 15 12 shall require participants to pay program costs and to install
 15 13 an ignition interlock device.
 15 14    A court in a county that has established a pilot program
 15 15 may order a defendant, as a condition of pretrial release,
 15 16 probation, or bond, to participate in the program. Approved
 15 17 pilot programs shall begin January 15, 2017, or upon the
 15 18 effective date of DPH rules, whichever is earlier, and shall
 15 19 be conducted for a minimum of one year. The DPH is to adopt
 15 20 rules to implement the programs, including but not limited to
 15 21 provisions relating to applications for, approval of, costs of,
 15 22 and oversight of the pilot programs and reporting requirements
 15 23 for participating counties. The DPH is directed to submit
 15 24 a report on the results of the pilot programs and make
 15 25 recommendations to the general assembly by December 15, 2018.

 10 31 twenty=five percent of the United States poverty level as
 10 32 defined by the most recently revised poverty income guidelines
 10 33 published by the United States department of health and human
 10 34 services, and the department determines that the person is
 10 35 unable to pay for the cost of an ignition interlock device. In
 11  1 making the determination of a person's ability to pay for the
 11  2 cost of a device, the department shall consider not only the
 11  3 person's income, but also the person's other assets, including
 11  4 but not limited to cash, stocks, bonds, and any other property.
 11  5    (2)  The person has an income level greater than one hundred

 11 10 interlock device would cause the person substantial hardship.
 11 11 In determining whether substantial hardship would result, the
 11 12 department shall consider not only the person's income, but
 11 13 also the person's other assets, including but not limited to
 11 14 cash, stocks, bonds, and any other property.
 11 15    d.  The department shall adopt rules to administer this
 11 16 subsection, including but not limited to the manner used to
 11 17 determine the monthly ignition interlock user fee and the
 11 18 accepted form and manner in which a person may demonstrate
 11 19 indigency.
 11 20    Sec. 15.  SOBRIETY MONITORING PILOT PROGRAMS.
 11 21    1.  The department of public health, in collaboration
 11 22 with the department of corrections, the department of public
 11 23 safety, and the department of transportation, may approve an
 11 24 application from a county for a countywide sobriety monitoring
 11 25 pilot program that is available twenty=four hours per day,
 11 26 seven days per week, in an effort to reduce the number of
 11 27 crimes related to operating while intoxicated. One application
 11 28 shall be approved for a county with a population of two hundred
 11 29 thousand people or more, one application shall be approved
 11 30 for a county with a population of one hundred thousand people
 11 31 or more but less than two hundred thousand people, and one
 11 32 application shall be approved for a county with a population of
 11 33 less than one hundred thousand people.
 11 34    2.  A sobriety monitoring pilot program shall do all of the
 11 35 following:
 12  1    a.  Require a person who has been charged with, pled guilty
 12  2 to, or been convicted of a violation of section 321J.2 to
 12  3 abstain from all chemical substances for a period of time.
 12  4    b.  Require the person to be subject to testing to determine
 12  5 whether a chemical substance is present in the person's body
 12  6 in the following manner:
 12  7    (1)  At least twice per day at a central location where an
 12  8 immediate sanction can be applied.
 12  9    (2)  Where testing under subparagraph (1) is impractical, by
 12 10 continuous transdermal or electronic monitoring.
 12 11    c.  Apply sanctions when test results definitively, and
 12 12 without presumption, indicate the presence of chemical
 12 13 substances.
 12 14    d.  Require a person participating in the program to pay
 12 15 program costs, including costs of installation, monitoring, and
 12 16 deactivation of any testing devices.
 12 17    e.  Require the person to install an ignition interlock
 12 18 device of a type approved by the commissioner of public safety
 12 19 on all vehicles owned or operated by the person, and require
 12 20 the person to pay the costs associated with the installation
 12 21 and use of the ignition interlock device.
 12 22    3.  A court in a county that has established a pilot program
 12 23 pursuant to this section may order a defendant, as a condition
 12 24 of pretrial release, probation, or bond, to participate in the
 12 25 program.
 12 26    4.  An approved pilot program shall begin on January 15,
 12 27 2017, or upon the effective date of department rules, whichever
 12 28 is earlier, and shall be conducted for a minimum of one year.
 12 29    5.  The department of public health shall adopt rules
 12 30 pursuant to chapter 17A to implement this section including
 12 31 but not limited to provisions relating to applications for,
 12 32 approval of, costs of, and oversight of the pilot programs and
 12 33 reporting requirements for participating counties.
 12 34    6.  The department of public health shall submit a report on
 12 35 the results of the pilot programs and make recommendations to
 13  1 the general assembly by December 15, 2018.
 13  2    7.  For the purposes of this section, "chemical substance"
 13  3 means alcohol, wine, spirits, and beer as defined in section
 13  4 123.3 and controlled substances as defined in section 124.101.
 13  5                           EXPLANATION
 13  6 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
 13  7 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
 13  8    Current law requires a person guilty of operating while
 13  9 intoxicated (OWI) to install an ignition interlock device in
 13 10 the person's vehicle if the person seeks a temporary restricted
 13 11 license, unless the person's alcohol concentration was less
 13 12 than .10 and no accident occurred. This bill strikes that
 13 13 exception, and also requires a person guilty of OWI to install
 13 14 an ignition interlock device in the person's vehicle upon the
 13 15 revocation of the person's driver's license rather than upon
 13 16 the person's application for a temporary restricted license.
 13 17    Under current law, an ignition interlock device is required
 13 18 to be installed in a person's vehicle for the period of time
 13 19 for which the person's temporary restricted license is issued,
 13 20 and up to one additional year after license reinstatement if
 13 21 the person has two or more OWI revocations. The bill requires
 13 22 the permanent installation of an ignition interlock device with
 13 23 two exceptions. If the ignition interlock device was installed
 13 24 as a result of the person's first OWI offense or revocation and
 13 25 a test was obtained, the device shall be uninstalled 180 days
 13 26 after the person's license was revoked, the person last failed
 13 27 a test by the ignition interlock device, or the defendant last
 13 28 failed to maintain the device as required, whichever is latest.
 13 29 If the ignition interlock device was installed as a result of
 13 30 the person's first OWI offense or revocation and a test was
 13 31 refused, the device shall be uninstalled 180 days after the
 13 32 person's license revocation period is over, the person last
 13 33 failed a test by the ignition interlock device, or the person
 13 34 last failed to maintain the device as required, whichever is
 13 35 latest.
 14  1 The bill provides an ignition interlock device shall not
 14  2 be uninstalled if the person has been convicted of a second
 14  3 or subsequent OWI violation, if the person's license has been
 14  4 revoked for a second or subsequent time, or if the person has
 14  5 been convicted of tampering with or circumventing an ignition
 14  6 interlock device.
 14  7    The bill requires the department of transportation (DOT)
 14  8 to assess a monthly ignition interlock user fee to each user
 14  9 of an ignition interlock device. All ignition interlock user
 14 10 fees will be collected by the DOT and deposited in an ignition
 14 11 interlock indigent user fund (IIIUF). The bill requires the
 14 12 DOT to use the moneys in the IIIUF to assist indigent users
 14 13 of ignition interlock devices in paying for the use of the
 14 14 devices. The amount of the monthly ignition interlock user fee
 14 15 shall be set by the DOT so that the moneys in the IIIUF are
 14 16 sufficient to assist all indigent users of ignition interlock
 14 17 devices in paying for the use of the devices.
 14 18    Under the bill, a person is indigent if the person has an
 14 19 income level at or below 125 percent of the U.S. poverty level
 14 20 and the person is unable to pay for the cost of an ignition
 14 21 interlock device. A person is also indigent if the person has
 14 22 an income level greater than 125 percent, but at or below 200
 14 23 percent, of the U.S. poverty level and paying for the ignition
 14 24 interlock device would cause the person substantial hardship.
 14 25    The bill provides for county sobriety monitoring pilot
 14 26 programs. The bill allows the department of public health
 14 27 (DPH), in collaboration with the department of corrections,
 14 28 the department of public safety, and the DOT, to approve
 14 29 applications from counties for countywide sobriety monitoring
 14 30 pilot programs. The programs are to be available 24 hours per
 14 31 day, seven days per week, in an effort to reduce the number
 14 32 of crimes related to OWI.  One application shall be approved
 14 33 for a county with a population of 200,000 people or more, one
 14 34 application shall be approved for a county with a population of
 14 35 100,000 people or more but less than 200,000 people, and one
 15  1 application shall be approved for a county with a population of
 15  2 less than 100,000 people.
 15  3    The programs shall require individuals charged with or
 15  4 convicted of OWI to abstain from all chemical substances for
 15  5 a period of time. The programs are to require testing to
 15  6 determine whether a chemical substance is present at least
 15  7 twice per day at a central location where an immediate sanction
 15  8 can be applied or, where such testing is impractical, by
 15  9 continuous transdermal or electronic monitoring. The programs
 15 10 shall also apply sanctions when test results definitively
 15 11 indicate the presence of a chemical substance. The programs
 15 12 shall require participants to pay program costs and to install
 15 13 an ignition interlock device.
 15 14    A court in a county that has established a pilot program

 10 31 twenty=five percent of the United States poverty level as
 10 32 defined by the most recently revised poverty income guidelines
 10 33 published by the United States department of health and human
 10 34 services, and the department determines that the person is
 10 35 unable to pay for the cost of an ignition interlock device. In
 11  1 making the determination of a person's ability to pay for the
 11  2 cost of a device, the department shall consider not only the
 11  3 person's income, but also the person's other assets, including
 11  4 but not limited to cash, stocks, bonds, and any other property.
 11  5    (2)  The person has an income level greater than one hundred
 11  6 twenty=five percent, but at or below two hundred percent, of
 11  7 the most recently revised poverty income guidelines published
 11  8 by the United States department of health and human services,
 11  9 and the department determines that paying for the ignition
 11 10 interlock device would cause the person substantial hardship.
 11 11 In determining whether substantial hardship would result, the
 11 12 department shall consider not only the person's income, but
 11 13 also the person's other assets, including but not limited to
 11 14 cash, stocks, bonds, and any other property.
 11 15    d.  The department shall adopt rules to administer this
 11 16 subsection, including but not limited to the manner used to
 11 17 determine the monthly ignition interlock user fee and the
 11 18 accepted form and manner in which a person may demonstrate
 11 19 indigency.
 11 20    Sec. 15.  SOBRIETY MONITORING PILOT PROGRAMS.
 11 21    1.  The department of public health, in collaboration
 11 22 with the department of corrections, the department of public
 11 23 safety, and the department of transportation, may approve an
 11 24 application from a county for a countywide sobriety monitoring
 11 25 pilot program that is available twenty=four hours per day,
 11 26 seven days per week, in an effort to reduce the number of
 11 27 crimes related to operating while intoxicated. One application
 11 28 shall be approved for a county with a population of two hundred
 11 29 thousand people or more, one application shall be approved
 11 30 for a county with a population of one hundred thousand people
 11 31 or more but less than two hundred thousand people, and one
 11 32 application shall be approved for a county with a population of
 11 33 less than one hundred thousand people.
 11 34    2.  A sobriety monitoring pilot program shall do all of the
 11 35 following:
 12  1    a.  Require a person who has been charged with, pled guilty
 12  2 to, or been convicted of a violation of section 321J.2 to
 12  3 abstain from all chemical substances for a period of time.
 12  4    b.  Require the person to be subject to testing to determine
 12  5 whether a chemical substance is present in the person's body
 12  6 in the following manner:
 12  7    (1)  At least twice per day at a central location where an
 12  8 immediate sanction can be applied.
 12  9    (2)  Where testing under subparagraph (1) is impractical, by
 12 10 continuous transdermal or electronic monitoring.
 12 11    c.  Apply sanctions when test results definitively, and
 12 12 without presumption, indicate the presence of chemical
 12 13 substances.
 12 14    d.  Require a person participating in the program to pay
 12 15 program costs, including costs of installation, monitoring, and
 12 16 deactivation of any testing devices.
 12 17    e.  Require the person to install an ignition interlock
 12 18 device of a type approved by the commissioner of public safety
 12 19 on all vehicles owned or operated by the person, and require
 12 20 the person to pay the costs associated with the installation
 12 21 and use of the ignition interlock device.
 12 22    3.  A court in a county that has established a pilot program
 12 23 pursuant to this section may order a defendant, as a condition
 12 24 of pretrial release, probation, or bond, to participate in the
 12 25 program.
 12 26    4.  An approved pilot program shall begin on January 15,
 12 27 2017, or upon the effective date of department rules, whichever
 12 28 is earlier, and shall be conducted for a minimum of one year.
 12 29    5.  The department of public health shall adopt rules
 12 30 pursuant to chapter 17A to implement this section including
 12 31 but not limited to provisions relating to applications for,
 12 32 approval of, costs of, and oversight of the pilot programs and
 12 33 reporting requirements for participating counties.
 12 34    6.  The department of public health shall submit a report on
 12 35 the results of the pilot programs and make recommendations to
 13  1 the general assembly by December 15, 2018.
 13  2    7.  For the purposes of this section, "chemical substance"
 13  3 means alcohol, wine, spirits, and beer as defined in section
 13  4 123.3 and controlled substances as defined in section 124.101.
 13  5                           EXPLANATION
 13  6 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
 13  7 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
 13  8    Current law requires a person guilty of operating while
 13  9 intoxicated (OWI) to install an ignition interlock device in
 13 10 the person's vehicle if the person seeks a temporary restricted
 13 11 license, unless the person's alcohol concentration was less
 13 12 than .10 and no accident occurred. This bill strikes that
 13 13 exception, and also requires a person guilty of OWI to install
 13 14 an ignition interlock device in the person's vehicle upon the
 13 15 revocation of the person's driver's license rather than upon
 13 16 the person's application for a temporary restricted license.
 13 17    Under current law, an ignition interlock device is required
 13 18 to be installed in a person's vehicle for the period of time
 13 19 for which the person's temporary restricted license is issued,
 13 20 and up to one additional year after license reinstatement if
 13 21 the person has two or more OWI revocations. The bill requires
 13 22 the permanent installation of an ignition interlock device with
 13 23 two exceptions. If the ignition interlock device was installed
 13 24 as a result of the person's first OWI offense or revocation and
 13 25 a test was obtained, the device shall be uninstalled 180 days
 13 26 after the person's license was revoked, the person last failed
 13 27 a test by the ignition interlock device, or the defendant last
 13 28 failed to maintain the device as required, whichever is latest.
 13 29 If the ignition interlock device was installed as a result of
 13 30 the person's first OWI offense or revocation and a test was
 13 31 refused, the device shall be uninstalled 180 days after the
 13 32 person's license revocation period is over, the person last
 13 33 failed a test by the ignition interlock device, or the person
 13 34 last failed to maintain the device as required, whichever is
 13 35 latest.
 14  1 The bill provides an ignition interlock device shall not
 14  2 be uninstalled if the person has been convicted of a second
 14  3 or subsequent OWI violation, if the person's license has been
 14  4 revoked for a second or subsequent time, or if the person has
 14  5 been convicted of tampering with or circumventing an ignition
 14  6 interlock device.
 14  7    The bill requires the department of transportation (DOT)
 14  8 to assess a monthly ignition interlock user fee to each user
 14  9 of an ignition interlock device. All ignition interlock user
 14 10 fees will be collected by the DOT and deposited in an ignition
 14 11 interlock indigent user fund (IIIUF). The bill requires the
 14 12 DOT to use the moneys in the IIIUF to assist indigent users
 14 13 of ignition interlock devices in paying for the use of the
 14 14 devices. The amount of the monthly ignition interlock user fee
 14 15 shall be set by the DOT so that the moneys in the IIIUF are
 14 16 sufficient to assist all indigent users of ignition interlock
 14 17 devices in paying for the use of the devices.
 14 18    Under the bill, a person is indigent if the person has an
 14 19 income level at or below 125 percent of the U.S. poverty level
 14 20 and the person is unable to pay for the cost of an ignition
 14 21 interlock device. A person is also indigent if the person has
 14 22 an income level greater than 125 percent, but at or below 200
 14 23 percent, of the U.S. poverty level and paying for the ignition
 14 24 interlock device would cause the person substantial hardship.
 14 25    The bill provides for county sobriety monitoring pilot
 14 26 programs. The bill allows the department of public health
 14 27 (DPH), in collaboration with the department of corrections,
 14 28 the department of public safety, and the DOT, to approve
 14 29 applications from counties for countywide sobriety monitoring
 14 30 pilot programs. The programs are to be available 24 hours per
 14 31 day, seven days per week, in an effort to reduce the number
 14 32 of crimes related to OWI.  One application shall be approved
 14 33 for a county with a population of 200,000 people or more, one
 14 34 application shall be approved for a county with a population of
 14 35 100,000 people or more but less than 200,000 people, and one
 15  1 application shall be approved for a county with a population of
 15  2 less than 100,000 people.
 15  3    The programs shall require individuals charged with or
 15  4 convicted of OWI to abstain from all chemical substances for
 15  5 a period of time. The programs are to require testing to
 15  6 determine whether a chemical substance is present at least
 15  7 twice per day at a central location where an immediate sanction
 15  8 can be applied or, where such testing is impractical, by
 15  9 continuous transdermal or electronic monitoring. The programs
 15 10 shall also apply sanctions when test results definitively
 15 11 indicate the presence of a chemical substance. The programs
 15 12 shall require participants to pay program costs and to install
 15 13 an ignition interlock device.
 15 14    A court in a county that has established a pilot program
 15 15 may order a defendant, as a condition of pretrial release,
 15 16 probation, or bond, to participate in the program. Approved
 15 17 pilot programs shall begin January 15, 2017, or upon the
 15 18 effective date of DPH rules, whichever is earlier, and shall
 15 19 be conducted for a minimum of one year. The DPH is to adopt
 15 20 rules to implement the programs, including but not limited to
 15 21 provisions relating to applications for, approval of, costs of,
 15 22 and oversight of the pilot programs and reporting requirements
 15 23 for participating counties. The DPH is directed to submit
 15 24 a report on the results of the pilot programs and make
 15 25 recommendations to the general assembly by December 15, 2018.

 11 20    Sec. 15.  SOBRIETY MONITORING PILOT PROGRAMS.
 11 21    1.  The department of public health, in collaboration
 11 22 with the department of corrections, the department of public
 11 23 safety, and the department of transportation, may approve an
 11 24 application from a county for a countywide sobriety monitoring

 13  2    7.  For the purposes of this section, "chemical substance"
 13  3 means alcohol, wine, spirits, and beer as defined in section
 13  4 123.3 and controlled substances as defined in section 124.101.
 13  5                           EXPLANATION
 13  6 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
 13  7 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
 13  8    Current law requires a person guilty of operating while
 13  9 intoxicated (OWI) to install an ignition interlock device in
 13 10 the person's vehicle if the person seeks a temporary restricted
 13 11 license, unless the person's alcohol concentration was less
 13 12 than .10 and no accident occurred. This bill strikes that
 13 13 exception, and also requires a person guilty of OWI to install
 13 14 an ignition interlock device in the person's vehicle upon the
 13 15 revocation of the person's driver's license rather than upon
 13 16 the person's application for a temporary restricted license.
 13 17    Under current law, an ignition interlock device is required
 13 18 to be installed in a person's vehicle for the period of time
 13 19 for which the person's temporary restricted license is issued,
 13 20 and up to one additional year after license reinstatement if
 13 21 the person has two or more OWI revocations. The bill requires
 13 22 the permanent installation of an ignition interlock device with
 13 23 two exceptions. If the ignition interlock device was installed
 13 24 as a result of the person's first OWI offense or revocation and
 13 25 a test was obtained, the device shall be uninstalled 180 days
 13 26 after the person's license was revoked, the person last failed
 13 27 a test by the ignition interlock device, or the defendant last
 13 28 failed to maintain the device as required, whichever is latest.
 13 29 If the ignition interlock device was installed as a result of
 13 30 the person's first OWI offense or revocation and a test was
 13 31 refused, the device shall be uninstalled 180 days after the
 13 32 person's license revocation period is over, the person last
 13 33 failed a test by the ignition interlock device, or the person
 13 34 last failed to maintain the device as required, whichever is
 13 35 latest.
 14  1 The bill provides an ignition interlock device shall not
 14  2 be uninstalled if the person has been convicted of a second
 14  3 or subsequent OWI violation, if the person's license has been
 14  4 revoked for a second or subsequent time, or if the person has
 14  5 been convicted of tampering with or circumventing an ignition
 14  6 interlock device.
 14  7    The bill requires the department of transportation (DOT)
 14  8 to assess a monthly ignition interlock user fee to each user
 14  9 of an ignition interlock device. All ignition interlock user
 14 10 fees will be collected by the DOT and deposited in an ignition
 14 11 interlock indigent user fund (IIIUF). The bill requires the
 14 12 DOT to use the moneys in the IIIUF to assist indigent users
 14 13 of ignition interlock devices in paying for the use of the
 14 14 devices. The amount of the monthly ignition interlock user fee
 14 15 shall be set by the DOT so that the moneys in the IIIUF are
 14 16 sufficient to assist all indigent users of ignition interlock
 14 17 devices in paying for the use of the devices.
 14 18    Under the bill, a person is indigent if the person has an
 14 19 income level at or below 125 percent of the U.S. poverty level
 14 20 and the person is unable to pay for the cost of an ignition
 14 21 interlock device. A person is also indigent if the person has
 14 22 an income level greater than 125 percent, but at or below 200
 14 23 percent, of the U.S. poverty level and paying for the ignition
 14 24 interlock device would cause the person substantial hardship.
 14 25    The bill provides for county sobriety monitoring pilot
 14 26 programs. The bill allows the department of public health
 14 27 (DPH), in collaboration with the department of corrections,
 14 28 the department of public safety, and the DOT, to approve
 14 29 applications from counties for countywide sobriety monitoring
 14 30 pilot programs. The programs are to be available 24 hours per
 14 31 day, seven days per week, in an effort to reduce the number
 14 32 of crimes related to OWI.  One application shall be approved
 14 33 for a county with a population of 200,000 people or more, one
 14 34 application shall be approved for a county with a population of
 14 35 100,000 people or more but less than 200,000 people, and one
 15  1 application shall be approved for a county with a population of
 15  2 less than 100,000 people.
 15  3    The programs shall require individuals charged with or
 15  4 convicted of OWI to abstain from all chemical substances for
 15  5 a period of time. The programs are to require testing to
 15  6 determine whether a chemical substance is present at least
 15  7 twice per day at a central location where an immediate sanction
 15  8 can be applied or, where such testing is impractical, by
 15  9 continuous transdermal or electronic monitoring. The programs
 15 10 shall also apply sanctions when test results definitively
 15 11 indicate the presence of a chemical substance. The programs
 15 12 shall require participants to pay program costs and to install
 15 13 an ignition interlock device.
 15 14    A court in a county that has established a pilot program
 15 15 may order a defendant, as a condition of pretrial release,
 15 16 probation, or bond, to participate in the program. Approved
 15 17 pilot programs shall begin January 15, 2017, or upon the
 15 18 effective date of DPH rules, whichever is earlier, and shall
 15 19 be conducted for a minimum of one year. The DPH is to adopt
 15 20 rules to implement the programs, including but not limited to
 15 21 provisions relating to applications for, approval of, costs of,
 15 22 and oversight of the pilot programs and reporting requirements
 15 23 for participating counties. The DPH is directed to submit
 15 24 a report on the results of the pilot programs and make
 15 25 recommendations to the general assembly by December 15, 2018.

 11 21    1.  The department of public health, in collaboration
 11 22 with the department of corrections, the department of public
 11 23 safety, and the department of transportation, may approve an
 11 24 application from a county for a countywide sobriety monitoring
 11 25 pilot program that is available twenty=four hours per day,
 11 26 seven days per week, in an effort to reduce the number of
 11 27 crimes related to operating while intoxicated. One application
 11 28 shall be approved for a county with a population of two hundred
 11 29 thousand people or more, one application shall be approved
 11 30 for a county with a population of one hundred thousand people
 11 31 or more but less than two hundred thousand people, and one
 11 32 application shall be approved for a county with a population of
 11 33 less than one hundred thousand people.
 11 34    2.  A sobriety monitoring pilot program shall do all of the

 12 11    c.  Apply sanctions when test results definitively, and
 12 12 without presumption, indicate the presence of chemical
 12 13 substances.
 12 14    d.  Require a person participating in the program to pay
 12 15 program costs, including costs of installation, monitoring, and
 12 16 deactivation of any testing devices.
 12 17    e.  Require the person to install an ignition interlock
 12 18 device of a type approved by the commissioner of public safety
 12 19 on all vehicles owned or operated by the person, and require
 12 20 the person to pay the costs associated with the installation
 12 21 and use of the ignition interlock device.
 12 22    3.  A court in a county that has established a pilot program
 12 23 pursuant to this section may order a defendant, as a condition
 12 24 of pretrial release, probation, or bond, to participate in the
 12 25 program.
 12 26    4.  An approved pilot program shall begin on January 15,
 12 27 2017, or upon the effective date of department rules, whichever
 12 28 is earlier, and shall be conducted for a minimum of one year.
 12 29    5.  The department of public health shall adopt rules
 12 30 pursuant to chapter 17A to implement this section including
 12 31 but not limited to provisions relating to applications for,
 12 32 approval of, costs of, and oversight of the pilot programs and
 12 33 reporting requirements for participating counties.
 12 34    6.  The department of public health shall submit a report on
 12 35 the results of the pilot programs and make recommendations to
 13  1 the general assembly by December 15, 2018.
 13  2    7.  For the purposes of this section, "chemical substance"
 13  3 means alcohol, wine, spirits, and beer as defined in section
 13  4 123.3 and controlled substances as defined in section 124.101.
 13  5                           EXPLANATION
 13  6 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
 13  7 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
 13  8    Current law requires a person guilty of operating while
 13  9 intoxicated (OWI) to install an ignition interlock device in
 13 10 the person's vehicle if the person seeks a temporary restricted
 13 11 license, unless the person's alcohol concentration was less
 13 12 than .10 and no accident occurred. This bill strikes that
 13 13 exception, and also requires a person guilty of OWI to install
 13 14 an ignition interlock device in the person's vehicle upon the
 13 15 revocation of the person's driver's license rather than upon
 13 16 the person's application for a temporary restricted license.
 13 17    Under current law, an ignition interlock device is required
 13 18 to be installed in a person's vehicle for the period of time
 13 19 for which the person's temporary restricted license is issued,
 13 20 and up to one additional year after license reinstatement if
 13 21 the person has two or more OWI revocations. The bill requires
 13 22 the permanent installation of an ignition interlock device with
 13 23 two exceptions. If the ignition interlock device was installed
 13 24 as a result of the person's first OWI offense or revocation and
 13 25 a test was obtained, the device shall be uninstalled 180 days
 13 26 after the person's license was revoked, the person last failed
 13 27 a test by the ignition interlock device, or the defendant last
 13 28 failed to maintain the device as required, whichever is latest.
 13 29 If the ignition interlock device was installed as a result of
 13 30 the person's first OWI offense or revocation and a test was
 13 31 refused, the device shall be uninstalled 180 days after the
 13 32 person's license revocation period is over, the person last
 13 33 failed a test by the ignition interlock device, or the person
 13 34 last failed to maintain the device as required, whichever is
 13 35 latest.
 14  1 The bill provides an ignition interlock device shall not
 14  2 be uninstalled if the person has been convicted of a second
 14  3 or subsequent OWI violation, if the person's license has been
 14  4 revoked for a second or subsequent time, or if the person has
 14  5 been convicted of tampering with or circumventing an ignition
 14  6 interlock device.
 14  7    The bill requires the department of transportation (DOT)
 14  8 to assess a monthly ignition interlock user fee to each user
 14  9 of an ignition interlock device. All ignition interlock user
 14 10 fees will be collected by the DOT and deposited in an ignition
 14 11 interlock indigent user fund (IIIUF). The bill requires the
 14 12 DOT to use the moneys in the IIIUF to assist indigent users
 14 13 of ignition interlock devices in paying for the use of the
 14 14 devices. The amount of the monthly ignition interlock user fee
 14 15 shall be set by the DOT so that the moneys in the IIIUF are
 14 16 sufficient to assist all indigent users of ignition interlock
 14 17 devices in paying for the use of the devices.
 14 18    Under the bill, a person is indigent if the person has an
 14 19 income level at or below 125 percent of the U.S. poverty level
 14 20 and the person is unable to pay for the cost of an ignition
 14 21 interlock device. A person is also indigent if the person has
 14 22 an income level greater than 125 percent, but at or below 200
 14 23 percent, of the U.S. poverty level and paying for the ignition
 14 24 interlock device would cause the person substantial hardship.
 14 25    The bill provides for county sobriety monitoring pilot
 14 26 programs. The bill allows the department of public health
 14 27 (DPH), in collaboration with the department of corrections,
 14 28 the department of public safety, and the DOT, to approve
 14 29 applications from counties for countywide sobriety monitoring
 14 30 pilot programs. The programs are to be available 24 hours per
 14 31 day, seven days per week, in an effort to reduce the number
 14 32 of crimes related to OWI.  One application shall be approved
 14 33 for a county with a population of 200,000 people or more, one
 14 34 application shall be approved for a county with a population of
 14 35 100,000 people or more but less than 200,000 people, and one
 15  1 application shall be approved for a county with a population of
 15  2 less than 100,000 people.
 15  3    The programs shall require individuals charged with or
 15  4 convicted of OWI to abstain from all chemical substances for
 15  5 a period of time. The programs are to require testing to
 15  6 determine whether a chemical substance is present at least
 15  7 twice per day at a central location where an immediate sanction
 15  8 can be applied or, where such testing is impractical, by
 15  9 continuous transdermal or electronic monitoring. The programs
 15 10 shall also apply sanctions when test results definitively
 15 11 indicate the presence of a chemical substance. The programs
 15 12 shall require participants to pay program costs and to install
 15 13 an ignition interlock device.
 15 14    A court in a county that has established a pilot program
 15 15 may order a defendant, as a condition of pretrial release,
 15 16 probation, or bond, to participate in the program. Approved
 15 17 pilot programs shall begin January 15, 2017, or upon the
 15 18 effective date of DPH rules, whichever is earlier, and shall
 15 19 be conducted for a minimum of one year. The DPH is to adopt
 15 20 rules to implement the programs, including but not limited to
 15 21 provisions relating to applications for, approval of, costs of,
 15 22 and oversight of the pilot programs and reporting requirements
 15 23 for participating counties. The DPH is directed to submit
 15 24 a report on the results of the pilot programs and make
 15 25 recommendations to the general assembly by December 15, 2018.

 10 33 published by the United States department of health and human
 10 34 services, and the department determines that the person is
 10 35 unable to pay for the cost of an ignition interlock device. In
 11  1 making the determination of a person's ability to pay for the
 11  2 cost of a device, the department shall consider not only the
 11  3 person's income, but also the person's other assets, including

 11  9 and the department determines that paying for the ignition
 11 10 interlock device would cause the person substantial hardship.
 11 11 In determining whether substantial hardship would result, the
 11 12 department shall consider not only the person's income, but
 11 13 also the person's other assets, including but not limited to

 11 18 accepted form and manner in which a person may demonstrate
 11 19 indigency.
 11 20    Sec. 15.  SOBRIETY MONITORING PILOT PROGRAMS.
 11 21    1.  The department of public health, in collaboration
 11 22 with the department of corrections, the department of public
 11 23 safety, and the department of transportation, may approve an
 11 24 application from a county for a countywide sobriety monitoring
 11 25 pilot program that is available twenty=four hours per day,
 11 26 seven days per week, in an effort to reduce the number of
 11 27 crimes related to operating while intoxicated. One application
 11 28 shall be approved for a county with a population of two hundred
 11 29 thousand people or more, one application shall be approved
 11 30 for a county with a population of one hundred thousand people
 11 31 or more but less than two hundred thousand people, and one
 11 32 application shall be approved for a county with a population of
 11 33 less than one hundred thousand people.
 11 34    2.  A sobriety monitoring pilot program shall do all of the
 11 35 following:
 12  1    a.  Require a person who has been charged with, pled guilty
 12  2 to, or been convicted of a violation of section 321J.2 to
 12  3 abstain from all chemical substances for a period of time.
 12  4    b.  Require the person to be subject to testing to determine
 12  5 whether a chemical substance is present in the person's body
 12  6 in the following manner:
 12  7    (1)  At least twice per day at a central location where an
 12  8 immediate sanction can be applied.
 12  9    (2)  Where testing under subparagraph (1) is impractical, by
 12 10 continuous transdermal or electronic monitoring.
 12 11    c.  Apply sanctions when test results definitively, and
 12 12 without presumption, indicate the presence of chemical
 12 13 substances.
 12 14    d.  Require a person participating in the program to pay
 12 15 program costs, including costs of installation, monitoring, and
 12 16 deactivation of any testing devices.
 12 17    e.  Require the person to install an ignition interlock
 12 18 device of a type approved by the commissioner of public safety
 12 19 on all vehicles owned or operated by the person, and require
 12 20 the person to pay the costs associated with the installation
 12 21 and use of the ignition interlock device.
 12 22    3.  A court in a county that has established a pilot program
 12 23 pursuant to this section may order a defendant, as a condition
 12 24 of pretrial release, probation, or bond, to participate in the
 12 25 program.
 12 26    4.  An approved pilot program shall begin on January 15,
 12 27 2017, or upon the effective date of department rules, whichever
 12 28 is earlier, and shall be conducted for a minimum of one year.
 12 29    5.  The department of public health shall adopt rules
 12 30 pursuant to chapter 17A to implement this section including
 12 31 but not limited to provisions relating to applications for,
 12 32 approval of, costs of, and oversight of the pilot programs and
 12 33 reporting requirements for participating counties.
 12 34    6.  The department of public health shall submit a report on
 12 35 the results of the pilot programs and make recommendations to
 13  1 the general assembly by December 15, 2018.
 13  2    7.  For the purposes of this section, "chemical substance"
 13  3 means alcohol, wine, spirits, and beer as defined in section
 13  4 123.3 and controlled substances as defined in section 124.101.
 13  5                           EXPLANATION
 13  6 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
 13  7 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
 13  8    Current law requires a person guilty of operating while
 13  9 intoxicated (OWI) to install an ignition interlock device in
 13 10 the person's vehicle if the person seeks a temporary restricted
 13 11 license, unless the person's alcohol concentration was less
 13 12 than .10 and no accident occurred. This bill strikes that
 13 13 exception, and also requires a person guilty of OWI to install
 13 14 an ignition interlock device in the person's vehicle upon the
 13 15 revocation of the person's driver's license rather than upon
 13 16 the person's application for a temporary restricted license.
 13 17    Under current law, an ignition interlock device is required
 13 18 to be installed in a person's vehicle for the period of time
 13 19 for which the person's temporary restricted license is issued,
 13 20 and up to one additional year after license reinstatement if
 13 21 the person has two or more OWI revocations. The bill requires
 13 22 the permanent installation of an ignition interlock device with
 13 23 two exceptions. If the ignition interlock device was installed
 13 24 as a result of the person's first OWI offense or revocation and
 13 25 a test was obtained, the device shall be uninstalled 180 days
 13 26 after the person's license was revoked, the person last failed
 13 27 a test by the ignition interlock device, or the defendant last
 13 28 failed to maintain the device as required, whichever is latest.
 13 29 If the ignition interlock device was installed as a result of
 13 30 the person's first OWI offense or revocation and a test was
 13 31 refused, the device shall be uninstalled 180 days after the
 13 32 person's license revocation period is over, the person last
 13 33 failed a test by the ignition interlock device, or the person
 13 34 last failed to maintain the device as required, whichever is
 13 35 latest.
 14  1 The bill provides an ignition interlock device shall not
 14  2 be uninstalled if the person has been convicted of a second
 14  3 or subsequent OWI violation, if the person's license has been
 14  4 revoked for a second or subsequent time, or if the person has
 14  5 been convicted of tampering with or circumventing an ignition
 14  6 interlock device.
 14  7    The bill requires the department of transportation (DOT)
 14  8 to assess a monthly ignition interlock user fee to each user
 14  9 of an ignition interlock device. All ignition interlock user
 14 10 fees will be collected by the DOT and deposited in an ignition
 14 11 interlock indigent user fund (IIIUF). The bill requires the
 14 12 DOT to use the moneys in the IIIUF to assist indigent users
 14 13 of ignition interlock devices in paying for the use of the
 14 14 devices. The amount of the monthly ignition interlock user fee
 14 15 shall be set by the DOT so that the moneys in the IIIUF are
 14 16 sufficient to assist all indigent users of ignition interlock
 14 17 devices in paying for the use of the devices.
 14 18    Under the bill, a person is indigent if the person has an
 14 19 income level at or below 125 percent of the U.S. poverty level
 14 20 and the person is unable to pay for the cost of an ignition
 14 21 interlock device. A person is also indigent if the person has
 14 22 an income level greater than 125 percent, but at or below 200
 14 23 percent, of the U.S. poverty level and paying for the ignition
 14 24 interlock device would cause the person substantial hardship.
 14 25    The bill provides for county sobriety monitoring pilot
 14 26 programs. The bill allows the department of public health
 14 27 (DPH), in collaboration with the department of corrections,
 14 28 the department of public safety, and the DOT, to approve
 14 29 applications from counties for countywide sobriety monitoring
 14 30 pilot programs. The programs are to be available 24 hours per
 14 31 day, seven days per week, in an effort to reduce the number
 14 32 of crimes related to OWI.  One application shall be approved
 14 33 for a county with a population of 200,000 people or more, one
 14 34 application shall be approved for a county with a population of
 14 35 100,000 people or more but less than 200,000 people, and one
 15  1 application shall be approved for a county with a population of
 15  2 less than 100,000 people.
 15  3    The programs shall require individuals charged with or
 15  4 convicted of OWI to abstain from all chemical substances for
 15  5 a period of time. The programs are to require testing to
 15  6 determine whether a chemical substance is present at least
 15  7 twice per day at a central location where an immediate sanction
 15  8 can be applied or, where such testing is impractical, by
 15  9 continuous transdermal or electronic monitoring. The programs
 15 10 shall also apply sanctions when test results definitively
 15 11 indicate the presence of a chemical substance. The programs
 15 12 shall require participants to pay program costs and to install
 15 13 an ignition interlock device.
 15 14    A court in a county that has established a pilot program
 15 15 may order a defendant, as a condition of pretrial release,
 15 16 probation, or bond, to participate in the program. Approved
 15 17 pilot programs shall begin January 15, 2017, or upon the
 15 18 effective date of DPH rules, whichever is earlier, and shall
 15 19 be conducted for a minimum of one year. The DPH is to adopt
 15 20 rules to implement the programs, including but not limited to
 15 21 provisions relating to applications for, approval of, costs of,
 15 22 and oversight of the pilot programs and reporting requirements
 15 23 for participating counties. The DPH is directed to submit
 15 24 a report on the results of the pilot programs and make
 15 25 recommendations to the general assembly by December 15, 2018.

 11 20    Sec. 15.  SOBRIETY MONITORING PILOT PROGRAMS.
 11 21    1.  The department of public health, in collaboration
 11 22 with the department of corrections, the department of public
 11 23 safety, and the department of transportation, may approve an
 11 24 application from a county for a countywide sobriety monitoring
 11 25 pilot program that is available twenty=four hours per day,
 11 26 seven days per week, in an effort to reduce the number of
 11 27 crimes related to operating while intoxicated. One application
 11 28 shall be approved for a county with a population of two hundred
 11 29 thousand people or more, one application shall be approved
 11 30 for a county with a population of one hundred thousand people
 11 31 or more but less than two hundred thousand people, and one
 11 32 application shall be approved for a county with a population of
 11 33 less than one hundred thousand people.
 11 34    2.  A sobriety monitoring pilot program shall do all of the
 11 35 following:
 12  1    a.  Require a person who has been charged with, pled guilty
 12  2 to, or been convicted of a violation of section 321J.2 to
 12  3 abstain from all chemical substances for a period of time.
 12  4    b.  Require the person to be subject to testing to determine
 12  5 whether a chemical substance is present in the person's body
 12  6 in the following manner:
 12  7    (1)  At least twice per day at a central location where an
 12  8 immediate sanction can be applied.
 12  9    (2)  Where testing under subparagraph (1) is impractical, by
 12 10 continuous transdermal or electronic monitoring.
 12 11    c.  Apply sanctions when test results definitively, and
 12 12 without presumption, indicate the presence of chemical
 12 13 substances.
 12 14    d.  Require a person participating in the program to pay
 12 15 program costs, including costs of installation, monitoring, and
 12 16 deactivation of any testing devices.
 12 17    e.  Require the person to install an ignition interlock
 12 18 device of a type approved by the commissioner of public safety
 12 19 on all vehicles owned or operated by the person, and require
 12 20 the person to pay the costs associated with the installation
 12 21 and use of the ignition interlock device.
 12 22    3.  A court in a county that has established a pilot program
 12 23 pursuant to this section may order a defendant, as a condition
 12 24 of pretrial release, probation, or bond, to participate in the
 12 25 program.
 12 26    4.  An approved pilot program shall begin on January 15,
 12 27 2017, or upon the effective date of department rules, whichever
 12 28 is earlier, and shall be conducted for a minimum of one year.
 12 29    5.  The department of public health shall adopt rules
 12 30 pursuant to chapter 17A to implement this section including
 12 31 but not limited to provisions relating to applications for,
 12 32 approval of, costs of, and oversight of the pilot programs and
 12 33 reporting requirements for participating counties.
 12 34    6.  The department of public health shall submit a report on
 12 35 the results of the pilot programs and make recommendations to
 13  1 the general assembly by December 15, 2018.
 13  2    7.  For the purposes of this section, "chemical substance"
 13  3 means alcohol, wine, spirits, and beer as defined in section
 13  4 123.3 and controlled substances as defined in section 124.101.
 13  5                           EXPLANATION
 13  6 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
 13  7 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
 13  8    Current law requires a person guilty of operating while
 13  9 intoxicated (OWI) to install an ignition interlock device in
 13 10 the person's vehicle if the person seeks a temporary restricted
 13 11 license, unless the person's alcohol concentration was less
 13 12 than .10 and no accident occurred. This bill strikes that
 13 13 exception, and also requires a person guilty of OWI to install
 13 14 an ignition interlock device in the person's vehicle upon the
 13 15 revocation of the person's driver's license rather than upon
 13 16 the person's application for a temporary restricted license.
 13 17    Under current law, an ignition interlock device is required
 13 18 to be installed in a person's vehicle for the period of time
 13 19 for which the person's temporary restricted license is issued,
 13 20 and up to one additional year after license reinstatement if
 13 21 the person has two or more OWI revocations. The bill requires
 13 22 the permanent installation of an ignition interlock device with
 13 23 two exceptions. If the ignition interlock device was installed
 13 24 as a result of the person's first OWI offense or revocation and
 13 25 a test was obtained, the device shall be uninstalled 180 days
 13 26 after the person's license was revoked, the person last failed
 13 27 a test by the ignition interlock device, or the defendant last
 13 28 failed to maintain the device as required, whichever is latest.
 13 29 If the ignition interlock device was installed as a result of
 13 30 the person's first OWI offense or revocation and a test was
 13 31 refused, the device shall be uninstalled 180 days after the
 13 32 person's license revocation period is over, the person last
 13 33 failed a test by the ignition interlock device, or the person
 13 34 last failed to maintain the device as required, whichever is
 13 35 latest.
 14  1 The bill provides an ignition interlock device shall not
 14  2 be uninstalled if the person has been convicted of a second
 14  3 or subsequent OWI violation, if the person's license has been
 14  4 revoked for a second or subsequent time, or if the person has
 14  5 been convicted of tampering with or circumventing an ignition
 14  6 interlock device.
 14  7    The bill requires the department of transportation (DOT)
 14  8 to assess a monthly ignition interlock user fee to each user
 14  9 of an ignition interlock device. All ignition interlock user
 14 10 fees will be collected by the DOT and deposited in an ignition
 14 11 interlock indigent user fund (IIIUF). The bill requires the
 14 12 DOT to use the moneys in the IIIUF to assist indigent users
 14 13 of ignition interlock devices in paying for the use of the
 14 14 devices. The amount of the monthly ignition interlock user fee
 14 15 shall be set by the DOT so that the moneys in the IIIUF are
 14 16 sufficient to assist all indigent users of ignition interlock
 14 17 devices in paying for the use of the devices.
 14 18    Under the bill, a person is indigent if the person has an
 14 19 income level at or below 125 percent of the U.S. poverty level
 14 20 and the person is unable to pay for the cost of an ignition
 14 21 interlock device. A person is also indigent if the person has
 14 22 an income level greater than 125 percent, but at or below 200
 14 23 percent, of the U.S. poverty level and paying for the ignition
 14 24 interlock device would cause the person substantial hardship.
 14 25    The bill provides for county sobriety monitoring pilot
 14 26 programs. The bill allows the department of public health
 14 27 (DPH), in collaboration with the department of corrections,
 14 28 the department of public safety, and the DOT, to approve
 14 29 applications from counties for countywide sobriety monitoring
 14 30 pilot programs. The programs are to be available 24 hours per
 14 31 day, seven days per week, in an effort to reduce the number
 14 32 of crimes related to OWI.  One application shall be approved
 14 33 for a county with a population of 200,000 people or more, one
 14 34 application shall be approved for a county with a population of
 14 35 100,000 people or more but less than 200,000 people, and one
 15  1 application shall be approved for a county with a population of
 15  2 less than 100,000 people.
 15  3    The programs shall require individuals charged with or
 15  4 convicted of OWI to abstain from all chemical substances for
 15  5 a period of time. The programs are to require testing to
 15  6 determine whether a chemical substance is present at least
 15  7 twice per day at a central location where an immediate sanction
 15  8 can be applied or, where such testing is impractical, by
 15  9 continuous transdermal or electronic monitoring. The programs
 15 10 shall also apply sanctions when test results definitively
 15 11 indicate the presence of a chemical substance. The programs
 15 12 shall require participants to pay program costs and to install
 15 13 an ignition interlock device.
 15 14    A court in a county that has established a pilot program
 15 15 may order a defendant, as a condition of pretrial release,
 15 16 probation, or bond, to participate in the program. Approved
 15 17 pilot programs shall begin January 15, 2017, or upon the
 15 18 effective date of DPH rules, whichever is earlier, and shall
 15 19 be conducted for a minimum of one year. The DPH is to adopt
 15 20 rules to implement the programs, including but not limited to
 15 21 provisions relating to applications for, approval of, costs of,
 15 22 and oversight of the pilot programs and reporting requirements
 15 23 for participating counties. The DPH is directed to submit
 15 24 a report on the results of the pilot programs and make
 15 25 recommendations to the general assembly by December 15, 2018.

 11  1 making the determination of a person's ability to pay for the
 11  2 cost of a device, the department shall consider not only the
 11  3 person's income, but also the person's other assets, including
 11  4 but not limited to cash, stocks, bonds, and any other property.
 11  5    (2)  The person has an income level greater than one hundred

 11 20    Sec. 15.  SOBRIETY MONITORING PILOT PROGRAMS.
 11 21    1.  The department of public health, in collaboration
 11 22 with the department of corrections, the department of public
 11 23 safety, and the department of transportation, may approve an
 11 24 application from a county for a countywide sobriety monitoring
 11 25 pilot program that is available twenty=four hours per day,
 11 26 seven days per week, in an effort to reduce the number of
 11 27 crimes related to operating while intoxicated. One application
 11 28 shall be approved for a county with a population of two hundred
 11 29 thousand people or more, one application shall be approved
 11 30 for a county with a population of one hundred thousand people
 11 31 or more but less than two hundred thousand people, and one
 11 32 application shall be approved for a county with a population of
 11 33 less than one hundred thousand people.
 11 34    2.  A sobriety monitoring pilot program shall do all of the
 11 35 following:
 12  1    a.  Require a person who has been charged with, pled guilty
 12  2 to, or been convicted of a violation of section 321J.2 to
 12  3 abstain from all chemical substances for a period of time.
 12  4    b.  Require the person to be subject to testing to determine
 12  5 whether a chemical substance is present in the person's body
 12  6 in the following manner:
 12  7    (1)  At least twice per day at a central location where an
 12  8 immediate sanction can be applied.
 12  9    (2)  Where testing under subparagraph (1) is impractical, by
 12 10 continuous transdermal or electronic monitoring.
 12 11    c.  Apply sanctions when test results definitively, and
 12 12 without presumption, indicate the presence of chemical
 12 13 substances.
 12 14    d.  Require a person participating in the program to pay
 12 15 program costs, including costs of installation, monitoring, and
 12 16 deactivation of any testing devices.
 12 17    e.  Require the person to install an ignition interlock
 12 18 device of a type approved by the commissioner of public safety
 12 19 on all vehicles owned or operated by the person, and require
 12 20 the person to pay the costs associated with the installation
 12 21 and use of the ignition interlock device.
 12 22    3.  A court in a county that has established a pilot program
 12 23 pursuant to this section may order a defendant, as a condition
 12 24 of pretrial release, probation, or bond, to participate in the
 12 25 program.
 12 26    4.  An approved pilot program shall begin on January 15,
 12 27 2017, or upon the effective date of department rules, whichever
 12 28 is earlier, and shall be conducted for a minimum of one year.
 12 29    5.  The department of public health shall adopt rules
 12 30 pursuant to chapter 17A to implement this section including
 12 31 but not limited to provisions relating to applications for,
 12 32 approval of, costs of, and oversight of the pilot programs and
 12 33 reporting requirements for participating counties.
 12 34    6.  The department of public health shall submit a report on
 12 35 the results of the pilot programs and make recommendations to
 13  1 the general assembly by December 15, 2018.
 13  2    7.  For the purposes of this section, "chemical substance"
 13  3 means alcohol, wine, spirits, and beer as defined in section
 13  4 123.3 and controlled substances as defined in section 124.101.
 13  5                           EXPLANATION
 13  6 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
 13  7 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
 13  8    Current law requires a person guilty of operating while
 13  9 intoxicated (OWI) to install an ignition interlock device in
 13 10 the person's vehicle if the person seeks a temporary restricted
 13 11 license, unless the person's alcohol concentration was less
 13 12 than .10 and no accident occurred. This bill strikes that
 13 13 exception, and also requires a person guilty of OWI to install
 13 14 an ignition interlock device in the person's vehicle upon the
 13 15 revocation of the person's driver's license rather than upon
 13 16 the person's application for a temporary restricted license.
 13 17    Under current law, an ignition interlock device is required
 13 18 to be installed in a person's vehicle for the period of time
 13 19 for which the person's temporary restricted license is issued,
 13 20 and up to one additional year after license reinstatement if
 13 21 the person has two or more OWI revocations. The bill requires
 13 22 the permanent installation of an ignition interlock device with
 13 23 two exceptions. If the ignition interlock device was installed
 13 24 as a result of the person's first OWI offense or revocation and
 13 25 a test was obtained, the device shall be uninstalled 180 days
 13 26 after the person's license was revoked, the person last failed
 13 27 a test by the ignition interlock device, or the defendant last
 13 28 failed to maintain the device as required, whichever is latest.
 13 29 If the ignition interlock device was installed as a result of
 13 30 the person's first OWI offense or revocation and a test was
 13 31 refused, the device shall be uninstalled 180 days after the
 13 32 person's license revocation period is over, the person last
 13 33 failed a test by the ignition interlock device, or the person
 13 34 last failed to maintain the device as required, whichever is
 13 35 latest.
 14  1 The bill provides an ignition interlock device shall not
 14  2 be uninstalled if the person has been convicted of a second
 14  3 or subsequent OWI violation, if the person's license has been
 14  4 revoked for a second or subsequent time, or if the person has
 14  5 been convicted of tampering with or circumventing an ignition
 14  6 interlock device.
 14  7    The bill requires the department of transportation (DOT)
 14  8 to assess a monthly ignition interlock user fee to each user
 14  9 of an ignition interlock device. All ignition interlock user
 14 10 fees will be collected by the DOT and deposited in an ignition
 14 11 interlock indigent user fund (IIIUF). The bill requires the
 14 12 DOT to use the moneys in the IIIUF to assist indigent users
 14 13 of ignition interlock devices in paying for the use of the
 14 14 devices. The amount of the monthly ignition interlock user fee
 14 15 shall be set by the DOT so that the moneys in the IIIUF are
 14 16 sufficient to assist all indigent users of ignition interlock
 14 17 devices in paying for the use of the devices.
 14 18    Under the bill, a person is indigent if the person has an
 14 19 income level at or below 125 percent of the U.S. poverty level
 14 20 and the person is unable to pay for the cost of an ignition
 14 21 interlock device. A person is also indigent if the person has
 14 22 an income level greater than 125 percent, but at or below 200
 14 23 percent, of the U.S. poverty level and paying for the ignition
 14 24 interlock device would cause the person substantial hardship.
 14 25    The bill provides for county sobriety monitoring pilot
 14 26 programs. The bill allows the department of public health
 14 27 (DPH), in collaboration with the department of corrections,
 14 28 the department of public safety, and the DOT, to approve
 14 29 applications from counties for countywide sobriety monitoring
 14 30 pilot programs. The programs are to be available 24 hours per
 14 31 day, seven days per week, in an effort to reduce the number
 14 32 of crimes related to OWI.  One application shall be approved
 14 33 for a county with a population of 200,000 people or more, one
 14 34 application shall be approved for a county with a population of
 14 35 100,000 people or more but less than 200,000 people, and one
 15  1 application shall be approved for a county with a population of
 15  2 less than 100,000 people.
 15  3    The programs shall require individuals charged with or
 15  4 convicted of OWI to abstain from all chemical substances for
 15  5 a period of time. The programs are to require testing to
 15  6 determine whether a chemical substance is present at least
 15  7 twice per day at a central location where an immediate sanction
 15  8 can be applied or, where such testing is impractical, by
 15  9 continuous transdermal or electronic monitoring. The programs
 15 10 shall also apply sanctions when test results definitively
 15 11 indicate the presence of a chemical substance. The programs
 15 12 shall require participants to pay program costs and to install
 15 13 an ignition interlock device.
 15 14    A court in a county that has established a pilot program
 15 15 may order a defendant, as a condition of pretrial release,
 15 16 probation, or bond, to participate in the program. Approved
 15 17 pilot programs shall begin January 15, 2017, or upon the
 15 18 effective date of DPH rules, whichever is earlier, and shall
 15 19 be conducted for a minimum of one year. The DPH is to adopt
 15 20 rules to implement the programs, including but not limited to
 15 21 provisions relating to applications for, approval of, costs of,
 15 22 and oversight of the pilot programs and reporting requirements
 15 23 for participating counties. The DPH is directed to submit
 15 24 a report on the results of the pilot programs and make
 15 25 recommendations to the general assembly by December 15, 2018.

 11 21    1.  The department of public health, in collaboration
 11 22 with the department of corrections, the department of public
 11 23 safety, and the department of transportation, may approve an
 11 24 application from a county for a countywide sobriety monitoring
 11 25 pilot program that is available twenty=four hours per day,
 11 26 seven days per week, in an effort to reduce the number of
 11 27 crimes related to operating while intoxicated. One application
 11 28 shall be approved for a county with a population of two hundred
 11 29 thousand people or more, one application shall be approved
 11 30 for a county with a population of one hundred thousand people
 11 31 or more but less than two hundred thousand people, and one
 11 32 application shall be approved for a county with a population of
 11 33 less than one hundred thousand people.
 11 34    2.  A sobriety monitoring pilot program shall do all of the
 11 35 following:
 12  1    a.  Require a person who has been charged with, pled guilty
 12  2 to, or been convicted of a violation of section 321J.2 to
 12  3 abstain from all chemical substances for a period of time.
 12  4    b.  Require the person to be subject to testing to determine
 12  5 whether a chemical substance is present in the person's body
 12  6 in the following manner:
 12  7    (1)  At least twice per day at a central location where an
 12  8 immediate sanction can be applied.
 12  9    (2)  Where testing under subparagraph (1) is impractical, by

 12 13 substances.
 12 14    d.  Require a person participating in the program to pay
 12 15 program costs, including costs of installation, monitoring, and
 12 16 deactivation of any testing devices.
 12 17    e.  Require the person to install an ignition interlock
 12 18 device of a type approved by the commissioner of public safety
 12 19 on all vehicles owned or operated by the person, and require
 12 20 the person to pay the costs associated with the installation
 12 21 and use of the ignition interlock device.
 12 22    3.  A court in a county that has established a pilot program
 12 23 pursuant to this section may order a defendant, as a condition
 12 24 of pretrial release, probation, or bond, to participate in the
 12 25 program.
 12 26    4.  An approved pilot program shall begin on January 15,
 12 27 2017, or upon the effective date of department rules, whichever
 12 28 is earlier, and shall be conducted for a minimum of one year.
 12 29    5.  The department of public health shall adopt rules
 12 30 pursuant to chapter 17A to implement this section including
 12 31 but not limited to provisions relating to applications for,
 12 32 approval of, costs of, and oversight of the pilot programs and
 12 33 reporting requirements for participating counties.
 12 34    6.  The department of public health shall submit a report on
 12 35 the results of the pilot programs and make recommendations to
 13  1 the general assembly by December 15, 2018.
 13  2    7.  For the purposes of this section, "chemical substance"
 13  3 means alcohol, wine, spirits, and beer as defined in section
 13  4 123.3 and controlled substances as defined in section 124.101.
 13  5                           EXPLANATION
 13  6 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
 13  7 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
 13  8    Current law requires a person guilty of operating while
 13  9 intoxicated (OWI) to install an ignition interlock device in
 13 10 the person's vehicle if the person seeks a temporary restricted
 13 11 license, unless the person's alcohol concentration was less
 13 12 than .10 and no accident occurred. This bill strikes that
 13 13 exception, and also requires a person guilty of OWI to install
 13 14 an ignition interlock device in the person's vehicle upon the
 13 15 revocation of the person's driver's license rather than upon
 13 16 the person's application for a temporary restricted license.
 13 17    Under current law, an ignition interlock device is required
 13 18 to be installed in a person's vehicle for the period of time
 13 19 for which the person's temporary restricted license is issued,
 13 20 and up to one additional year after license reinstatement if
 13 21 the person has two or more OWI revocations. The bill requires
 13 22 the permanent installation of an ignition interlock device with
 13 23 two exceptions. If the ignition interlock device was installed
 13 24 as a result of the person's first OWI offense or revocation and
 13 25 a test was obtained, the device shall be uninstalled 180 days
 13 26 after the person's license was revoked, the person last failed
 13 27 a test by the ignition interlock device, or the defendant last
 13 28 failed to maintain the device as required, whichever is latest.
 13 29 If the ignition interlock device was installed as a result of
 13 30 the person's first OWI offense or revocation and a test was
 13 31 refused, the device shall be uninstalled 180 days after the
 13 32 person's license revocation period is over, the person last
 13 33 failed a test by the ignition interlock device, or the person
 13 34 last failed to maintain the device as required, whichever is
 13 35 latest.
 14  1 The bill provides an ignition interlock device shall not
 14  2 be uninstalled if the person has been convicted of a second
 14  3 or subsequent OWI violation, if the person's license has been
 14  4 revoked for a second or subsequent time, or if the person has
 14  5 been convicted of tampering with or circumventing an ignition
 14  6 interlock device.
 14  7    The bill requires the department of transportation (DOT)
 14  8 to assess a monthly ignition interlock user fee to each user
 14  9 of an ignition interlock device. All ignition interlock user
 14 10 fees will be collected by the DOT and deposited in an ignition
 14 11 interlock indigent user fund (IIIUF). The bill requires the
 14 12 DOT to use the moneys in the IIIUF to assist indigent users
 14 13 of ignition interlock devices in paying for the use of the
 14 14 devices. The amount of the monthly ignition interlock user fee
 14 15 shall be set by the DOT so that the moneys in the IIIUF are
 14 16 sufficient to assist all indigent users of ignition interlock
 14 17 devices in paying for the use of the devices.
 14 18    Under the bill, a person is indigent if the person has an
 14 19 income level at or below 125 percent of the U.S. poverty level
 14 20 and the person is unable to pay for the cost of an ignition
 14 21 interlock device. A person is also indigent if the person has
 14 22 an income level greater than 125 percent, but at or below 200
 14 23 percent, of the U.S. poverty level and paying for the ignition
 14 24 interlock device would cause the person substantial hardship.
 14 25    The bill provides for county sobriety monitoring pilot
 14 26 programs. The bill allows the department of public health
 14 27 (DPH), in collaboration with the department of corrections,
 14 28 the department of public safety, and the DOT, to approve
 14 29 applications from counties for countywide sobriety monitoring
 14 30 pilot programs. The programs are to be available 24 hours per
 14 31 day, seven days per week, in an effort to reduce the number
 14 32 of crimes related to OWI.  One application shall be approved
 14 33 for a county with a population of 200,000 people or more, one
 14 34 application shall be approved for a county with a population of
 14 35 100,000 people or more but less than 200,000 people, and one
 15  1 application shall be approved for a county with a population of
 15  2 less than 100,000 people.
 15  3    The programs shall require individuals charged with or
 15  4 convicted of OWI to abstain from all chemical substances for
 15  5 a period of time. The programs are to require testing to
 15  6 determine whether a chemical substance is present at least
 15  7 twice per day at a central location where an immediate sanction
 15  8 can be applied or, where such testing is impractical, by
 15  9 continuous transdermal or electronic monitoring. The programs
 15 10 shall also apply sanctions when test results definitively
 15 11 indicate the presence of a chemical substance. The programs
 15 12 shall require participants to pay program costs and to install
 15 13 an ignition interlock device.
 15 14    A court in a county that has established a pilot program
 15 15 may order a defendant, as a condition of pretrial release,
 15 16 probation, or bond, to participate in the program. Approved
 15 17 pilot programs shall begin January 15, 2017, or upon the
 15 18 effective date of DPH rules, whichever is earlier, and shall
 15 19 be conducted for a minimum of one year. The DPH is to adopt
 15 20 rules to implement the programs, including but not limited to
 15 21 provisions relating to applications for, approval of, costs of,
 15 22 and oversight of the pilot programs and reporting requirements
 15 23 for participating counties. The DPH is directed to submit
 15 24 a report on the results of the pilot programs and make
 15 25 recommendations to the general assembly by December 15, 2018.

 11 15    d.  The department shall adopt rules to administer this
 11 16 subsection, including but not limited to the manner used to
 11 17 determine the monthly ignition interlock user fee and the
 11 18 accepted form and manner in which a person may demonstrate
 11 19 indigency.
 11 20    Sec. 15.  SOBRIETY MONITORING PILOT PROGRAMS.
 11 21    1.  The department of public health, in collaboration
 11 22 with the department of corrections, the department of public
 11 23 safety, and the department of transportation, may approve an
 11 24 application from a county for a countywide sobriety monitoring
 11 25 pilot program that is available twenty=four hours per day,
 11 26 seven days per week, in an effort to reduce the number of
 11 27 crimes related to operating while intoxicated. One application
 11 28 shall be approved for a county with a population of two hundred
 11 29 thousand people or more, one application shall be approved
 11 30 for a county with a population of one hundred thousand people
 11 31 or more but less than two hundred thousand people, and one
 11 32 application shall be approved for a county with a population of
 11 33 less than one hundred thousand people.
 11 34    2.  A sobriety monitoring pilot program shall do all of the
 11 35 following:
 12  1    a.  Require a person who has been charged with, pled guilty
 12  2 to, or been convicted of a violation of section 321J.2 to
 12  3 abstain from all chemical substances for a period of time.
 12  4    b.  Require the person to be subject to testing to determine
 12  5 whether a chemical substance is present in the person's body
 12  6 in the following manner:
 12  7    (1)  At least twice per day at a central location where an
 12  8 immediate sanction can be applied.
 12  9    (2)  Where testing under subparagraph (1) is impractical, by
 12 10 continuous transdermal or electronic monitoring.
 12 11    c.  Apply sanctions when test results definitively, and
 12 12 without presumption, indicate the presence of chemical
 12 13 substances.
 12 14    d.  Require a person participating in the program to pay
 12 15 program costs, including costs of installation, monitoring, and
 12 16 deactivation of any testing devices.
 12 17    e.  Require the person to install an ignition interlock
 12 18 device of a type approved by the commissioner of public safety
 12 19 on all vehicles owned or operated by the person, and require
 12 20 the person to pay the costs associated with the installation
 12 21 and use of the ignition interlock device.
 12 22    3.  A court in a county that has established a pilot program
 12 23 pursuant to this section may order a defendant, as a condition
 12 24 of pretrial release, probation, or bond, to participate in the
 12 25 program.
 12 26    4.  An approved pilot program shall begin on January 15,
 12 27 2017, or upon the effective date of department rules, whichever
 12 28 is earlier, and shall be conducted for a minimum of one year.
 12 29    5.  The department of public health shall adopt rules
 12 30 pursuant to chapter 17A to implement this section including
 12 31 but not limited to provisions relating to applications for,
 12 32 approval of, costs of, and oversight of the pilot programs and
 12 33 reporting requirements for participating counties.
 12 34    6.  The department of public health shall submit a report on
 12 35 the results of the pilot programs and make recommendations to
 13  1 the general assembly by December 15, 2018.
 13  2    7.  For the purposes of this section, "chemical substance"
 13  3 means alcohol, wine, spirits, and beer as defined in section
 13  4 123.3 and controlled substances as defined in section 124.101.
 13  5                           EXPLANATION
 13  6 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
 13  7 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
 13  8    Current law requires a person guilty of operating while
 13  9 intoxicated (OWI) to install an ignition interlock device in
 13 10 the person's vehicle if the person seeks a temporary restricted
 13 11 license, unless the person's alcohol concentration was less
 13 12 than .10 and no accident occurred. This bill strikes that
 13 13 exception, and also requires a person guilty of OWI to install
 13 14 an ignition interlock device in the person's vehicle upon the
 13 15 revocation of the person's driver's license rather than upon
 13 16 the person's application for a temporary restricted license.
 13 17    Under current law, an ignition interlock device is required
 13 18 to be installed in a person's vehicle for the period of time
 13 19 for which the person's temporary restricted license is issued,
 13 20 and up to one additional year after license reinstatement if
 13 21 the person has two or more OWI revocations. The bill requires
 13 22 the permanent installation of an ignition interlock device with
 13 23 two exceptions. If the ignition interlock device was installed
 13 24 as a result of the person's first OWI offense or revocation and
 13 25 a test was obtained, the device shall be uninstalled 180 days
 13 26 after the person's license was revoked, the person last failed
 13 27 a test by the ignition interlock device, or the defendant last
 13 28 failed to maintain the device as required, whichever is latest.
 13 29 If the ignition interlock device was installed as a result of
 13 30 the person's first OWI offense or revocation and a test was
 13 31 refused, the device shall be uninstalled 180 days after the
 13 32 person's license revocation period is over, the person last
 13 33 failed a test by the ignition interlock device, or the person
 13 34 last failed to maintain the device as required, whichever is
 13 35 latest.
 14  1 The bill provides an ignition interlock device shall not
 14  2 be uninstalled if the person has been convicted of a second
 14  3 or subsequent OWI violation, if the person's license has been
 14  4 revoked for a second or subsequent time, or if the person has
 14  5 been convicted of tampering with or circumventing an ignition
 14  6 interlock device.
 14  7    The bill requires the department of transportation (DOT)
 14  8 to assess a monthly ignition interlock user fee to each user
 14  9 of an ignition interlock device. All ignition interlock user
 14 10 fees will be collected by the DOT and deposited in an ignition
 14 11 interlock indigent user fund (IIIUF). The bill requires the
 14 12 DOT to use the moneys in the IIIUF to assist indigent users
 14 13 of ignition interlock devices in paying for the use of the
 14 14 devices. The amount of the monthly ignition interlock user fee
 14 15 shall be set by the DOT so that the moneys in the IIIUF are
 14 16 sufficient to assist all indigent users of ignition interlock
 14 17 devices in paying for the use of the devices.
 14 18    Under the bill, a person is indigent if the person has an
 14 19 income level at or below 125 percent of the U.S. poverty level
 14 20 and the person is unable to pay for the cost of an ignition
 14 21 interlock device. A person is also indigent if the person has
 14 22 an income level greater than 125 percent, but at or below 200
 14 23 percent, of the U.S. poverty level and paying for the ignition
 14 24 interlock device would cause the person substantial hardship.
 14 25    The bill provides for county sobriety monitoring pilot
 14 26 programs. The bill allows the department of public health
 14 27 (DPH), in collaboration with the department of corrections,
 14 28 the department of public safety, and the DOT, to approve
 14 29 applications from counties for countywide sobriety monitoring
 14 30 pilot programs. The programs are to be available 24 hours per
 14 31 day, seven days per week, in an effort to reduce the number
 14 32 of crimes related to OWI.  One application shall be approved
 14 33 for a county with a population of 200,000 people or more, one
 14 34 application shall be approved for a county with a population of
 14 35 100,000 people or more but less than 200,000 people, and one
 15  1 application shall be approved for a county with a population of
 15  2 less than 100,000 people.
 15  3    The programs shall require individuals charged with or
 15  4 convicted of OWI to abstain from all chemical substances for
 15  5 a period of time. The programs are to require testing to
 15  6 determine whether a chemical substance is present at least
 15  7 twice per day at a central location where an immediate sanction
 15  8 can be applied or, where such testing is impractical, by
 15  9 continuous transdermal or electronic monitoring. The programs
 15 10 shall also apply sanctions when test results definitively
 15 11 indicate the presence of a chemical substance. The programs
 15 12 shall require participants to pay program costs and to install
 15 13 an ignition interlock device.
 15 14    A court in a county that has established a pilot program
 15 15 may order a defendant, as a condition of pretrial release,
 15 16 probation, or bond, to participate in the program. Approved
 15 17 pilot programs shall begin January 15, 2017, or upon the
 15 18 effective date of DPH rules, whichever is earlier, and shall
 15 19 be conducted for a minimum of one year. The DPH is to adopt
 15 20 rules to implement the programs, including but not limited to
 15 21 provisions relating to applications for, approval of, costs of,
 15 22 and oversight of the pilot programs and reporting requirements
 15 23 for participating counties. The DPH is directed to submit
 15 24 a report on the results of the pilot programs and make
 15 25 recommendations to the general assembly by December 15, 2018.

 11  6 twenty=five percent, but at or below two hundred percent, of
 11  7 the most recently revised poverty income guidelines published
 11  8 by the United States department of health and human services,
 11  9 and the department determines that paying for the ignition
 11 10 interlock device would cause the person substantial hardship.
 11 11 In determining whether substantial hardship would result, the
 11 12 department shall consider not only the person's income, but
 11 13 also the person's other assets, including but not limited to
 11 14 cash, stocks, bonds, and any other property.
 11 15    d.  The department shall adopt rules to administer this

 11 20    Sec. 15.  SOBRIETY MONITORING PILOT PROGRAMS.
 11 21    1.  The department of public health, in collaboration
 11 22 with the department of corrections, the department of public
 11 23 safety, and the department of transportation, may approve an
 11 24 application from a county for a countywide sobriety monitoring
 11 25 pilot program that is available twenty=four hours per day,
 11 26 seven days per week, in an effort to reduce the number of
 11 27 crimes related to operating while intoxicated. One application
 11 28 shall be approved for a county with a population of two hundred
 11 29 thousand people or more, one application shall be approved
 11 30 for a county with a population of one hundred thousand people
 11 31 or more but less than two hundred thousand people, and one
 11 32 application shall be approved for a county with a population of
 11 33 less than one hundred thousand people.
 11 34    2.  A sobriety monitoring pilot program shall do all of the
 11 35 following:
 12  1    a.  Require a person who has been charged with, pled guilty
 12  2 to, or been convicted of a violation of section 321J.2 to
 12  3 abstain from all chemical substances for a period of time.
 12  4    b.  Require the person to be subject to testing to determine
 12  5 whether a chemical substance is present in the person's body
 12  6 in the following manner:
 12  7    (1)  At least twice per day at a central location where an
 12  8 immediate sanction can be applied.
 12  9    (2)  Where testing under subparagraph (1) is impractical, by
 12 10 continuous transdermal or electronic monitoring.
 12 11    c.  Apply sanctions when test results definitively, and
 12 12 without presumption, indicate the presence of chemical
 12 13 substances.
 12 14    d.  Require a person participating in the program to pay
 12 15 program costs, including costs of installation, monitoring, and
 12 16 deactivation of any testing devices.
 12 17    e.  Require the person to install an ignition interlock
 12 18 device of a type approved by the commissioner of public safety
 12 19 on all vehicles owned or operated by the person, and require
 12 20 the person to pay the costs associated with the installation
 12 21 and use of the ignition interlock device.
 12 22    3.  A court in a county that has established a pilot program
 12 23 pursuant to this section may order a defendant, as a condition
 12 24 of pretrial release, probation, or bond, to participate in the
 12 25 program.
 12 26    4.  An approved pilot program shall begin on January 15,
 12 27 2017, or upon the effective date of department rules, whichever
 12 28 is earlier, and shall be conducted for a minimum of one year.
 12 29    5.  The department of public health shall adopt rules
 12 30 pursuant to chapter 17A to implement this section including
 12 31 but not limited to provisions relating to applications for,
 12 32 approval of, costs of, and oversight of the pilot programs and
 12 33 reporting requirements for participating counties.
 12 34    6.  The department of public health shall submit a report on
 12 35 the results of the pilot programs and make recommendations to
 13  1 the general assembly by December 15, 2018.
 13  2    7.  For the purposes of this section, "chemical substance"
 13  3 means alcohol, wine, spirits, and beer as defined in section
 13  4 123.3 and controlled substances as defined in section 124.101.
 13  5                           EXPLANATION
 13  6 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
 13  7 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
 13  8    Current law requires a person guilty of operating while
 13  9 intoxicated (OWI) to install an ignition interlock device in
 13 10 the person's vehicle if the person seeks a temporary restricted
 13 11 license, unless the person's alcohol concentration was less
 13 12 than .10 and no accident occurred. This bill strikes that
 13 13 exception, and also requires a person guilty of OWI to install
 13 14 an ignition interlock device in the person's vehicle upon the
 13 15 revocation of the person's driver's license rather than upon
 13 16 the person's application for a temporary restricted license.
 13 17    Under current law, an ignition interlock device is required
 13 18 to be installed in a person's vehicle for the period of time
 13 19 for which the person's temporary restricted license is issued,
 13 20 and up to one additional year after license reinstatement if
 13 21 the person has two or more OWI revocations. The bill requires
 13 22 the permanent installation of an ignition interlock device with
 13 23 two exceptions. If the ignition interlock device was installed
 13 24 as a result of the person's first OWI offense or revocation and
 13 25 a test was obtained, the device shall be uninstalled 180 days
 13 26 after the person's license was revoked, the person last failed
 13 27 a test by the ignition interlock device, or the defendant last
 13 28 failed to maintain the device as required, whichever is latest.
 13 29 If the ignition interlock device was installed as a result of
 13 30 the person's first OWI offense or revocation and a test was
 13 31 refused, the device shall be uninstalled 180 days after the
 13 32 person's license revocation period is over, the person last
 13 33 failed a test by the ignition interlock device, or the person
 13 34 last failed to maintain the device as required, whichever is
 13 35 latest.
 14  1 The bill provides an ignition interlock device shall not
 14  2 be uninstalled if the person has been convicted of a second
 14  3 or subsequent OWI violation, if the person's license has been
 14  4 revoked for a second or subsequent time, or if the person has
 14  5 been convicted of tampering with or circumventing an ignition
 14  6 interlock device.
 14  7    The bill requires the department of transportation (DOT)
 14  8 to assess a monthly ignition interlock user fee to each user
 14  9 of an ignition interlock device. All ignition interlock user
 14 10 fees will be collected by the DOT and deposited in an ignition
 14 11 interlock indigent user fund (IIIUF). The bill requires the
 14 12 DOT to use the moneys in the IIIUF to assist indigent users
 14 13 of ignition interlock devices in paying for the use of the
 14 14 devices. The amount of the monthly ignition interlock user fee
 14 15 shall be set by the DOT so that the moneys in the IIIUF are
 14 16 sufficient to assist all indigent users of ignition interlock
 14 17 devices in paying for the use of the devices.
 14 18    Under the bill, a person is indigent if the person has an
 14 19 income level at or below 125 percent of the U.S. poverty level
 14 20 and the person is unable to pay for the cost of an ignition
 14 21 interlock device. A person is also indigent if the person has
 14 22 an income level greater than 125 percent, but at or below 200
 14 23 percent, of the U.S. poverty level and paying for the ignition
 14 24 interlock device would cause the person substantial hardship.
 14 25    The bill provides for county sobriety monitoring pilot
 14 26 programs. The bill allows the department of public health
 14 27 (DPH), in collaboration with the department of corrections,
 14 28 the department of public safety, and the DOT, to approve
 14 29 applications from counties for countywide sobriety monitoring
 14 30 pilot programs. The programs are to be available 24 hours per
 14 31 day, seven days per week, in an effort to reduce the number
 14 32 of crimes related to OWI.  One application shall be approved
 14 33 for a county with a population of 200,000 people or more, one
 14 34 application shall be approved for a county with a population of
 14 35 100,000 people or more but less than 200,000 people, and one
 15  1 application shall be approved for a county with a population of
 15  2 less than 100,000 people.
 15  3    The programs shall require individuals charged with or
 15  4 convicted of OWI to abstain from all chemical substances for
 15  5 a period of time. The programs are to require testing to
 15  6 determine whether a chemical substance is present at least
 15  7 twice per day at a central location where an immediate sanction

 15 10 shall also apply sanctions when test results definitively
 15 11 indicate the presence of a chemical substance. The programs
 15 12 shall require participants to pay program costs and to install
 15 13 an ignition interlock device.
 15 14    A court in a county that has established a pilot program
 15 15 may order a defendant, as a condition of pretrial release,
 15 16 probation, or bond, to participate in the program. Approved
 15 17 pilot programs shall begin January 15, 2017, or upon the
 15 18 effective date of DPH rules, whichever is earlier, and shall
 15 19 be conducted for a minimum of one year. The DPH is to adopt
 15 20 rules to implement the programs, including but not limited to
 15 21 provisions relating to applications for, approval of, costs of,
 15 22 and oversight of the pilot programs and reporting requirements
 15 23 for participating counties. The DPH is directed to submit
 15 24 a report on the results of the pilot programs and make

 13 20 and up to one additional year after license reinstatement if
 13 21 the person has two or more OWI revocations. The bill requires
 13 22 the permanent installation of an ignition interlock device with
 13 23 two exceptions. If the ignition interlock device was installed
 13 24 as a result of the person's first OWI offense or revocation and
 13 25 a test was obtained, the device shall be uninstalled 180 days
 13 26 after the person's license was revoked, the person last failed
 13 27 a test by the ignition interlock device, or the defendant last
 13 28 failed to maintain the device as required, whichever is latest.
 13 29 If the ignition interlock device was installed as a result of
 13 30 the person's first OWI offense or revocation and a test was
 13 31 refused, the device shall be uninstalled 180 days after the
 13 32 person's license revocation period is over, the person last
 13 33 failed a test by the ignition interlock device, or the person
 13 34 last failed to maintain the device as required, whichever is
 13 35 latest.
 14  1 The bill provides an ignition interlock device shall not
 14  2 be uninstalled if the person has been convicted of a second
 14  3 or subsequent OWI violation, if the person's license has been
 14  4 revoked for a second or subsequent time, or if the person has
 14  5 been convicted of tampering with or circumventing an ignition
 14  6 interlock device.
 14  7    The bill requires the department of transportation (DOT)
 14  8 to assess a monthly ignition interlock user fee to each user
 14  9 of an ignition interlock device. All ignition interlock user
 14 10 fees will be collected by the DOT and deposited in an ignition
 14 11 interlock indigent user fund (IIIUF). The bill requires the
 14 12 DOT to use the moneys in the IIIUF to assist indigent users
 14 13 of ignition interlock devices in paying for the use of the
 14 14 devices. The amount of the monthly ignition interlock user fee
 14 15 shall be set by the DOT so that the moneys in the IIIUF are
 14 16 sufficient to assist all indigent users of ignition interlock
 14 17 devices in paying for the use of the devices.
 14 18    Under the bill, a person is indigent if the person has an
 14 19 income level at or below 125 percent of the U.S. poverty level
 14 20 and the person is unable to pay for the cost of an ignition
 14 21 interlock device. A person is also indigent if the person has
 14 22 an income level greater than 125 percent, but at or below 200
 14 23 percent, of the U.S. poverty level and paying for the ignition
 14 24 interlock device would cause the person substantial hardship.
 14 25    The bill provides for county sobriety monitoring pilot
 14 26 programs. The bill allows the department of public health
 14 27 (DPH), in collaboration with the department of corrections,
 14 28 the department of public safety, and the DOT, to approve
 14 29 applications from counties for countywide sobriety monitoring
 14 30 pilot programs. The programs are to be available 24 hours per
 14 31 day, seven days per week, in an effort to reduce the number
 14 32 of crimes related to OWI.  One application shall be approved
 14 33 for a county with a population of 200,000 people or more, one
 14 34 application shall be approved for a county with a population of
 14 35 100,000 people or more but less than 200,000 people, and one
 15  1 application shall be approved for a county with a population of
 15  2 less than 100,000 people.
 15  3    The programs shall require individuals charged with or
 15  4 convicted of OWI to abstain from all chemical substances for
 15  5 a period of time. The programs are to require testing to
 15  6 determine whether a chemical substance is present at least
 15  7 twice per day at a central location where an immediate sanction
 15  8 can be applied or, where such testing is impractical, by
 15  9 continuous transdermal or electronic monitoring. The programs
 15 10 shall also apply sanctions when test results definitively
 15 11 indicate the presence of a chemical substance. The programs
 15 12 shall require participants to pay program costs and to install
 15 13 an ignition interlock device.
 15 14    A court in a county that has established a pilot program
 15 15 may order a defendant, as a condition of pretrial release,
 15 16 probation, or bond, to participate in the program. Approved
 15 17 pilot programs shall begin January 15, 2017, or upon the
 15 18 effective date of DPH rules, whichever is earlier, and shall
 15 19 be conducted for a minimum of one year. The DPH is to adopt
 15 20 rules to implement the programs, including but not limited to
 15 21 provisions relating to applications for, approval of, costs of,
 15 22 and oversight of the pilot programs and reporting requirements
 15 23 for participating counties. The DPH is directed to submit
 15 24 a report on the results of the pilot programs and make
 15 25 recommendations to the general assembly by December 15, 2018.

 11 20    Sec. 15.  SOBRIETY MONITORING PILOT PROGRAMS.
 11 21    1.  The department of public health, in collaboration
 11 22 with the department of corrections, the department of public
 11 23 safety, and the department of transportation, may approve an
 11 24 application from a county for a countywide sobriety monitoring
 11 25 pilot program that is available twenty=four hours per day,
 11 26 seven days per week, in an effort to reduce the number of
 11 27 crimes related to operating while intoxicated. One application
 11 28 shall be approved for a county with a population of two hundred
 11 29 thousand people or more, one application shall be approved
 11 30 for a county with a population of one hundred thousand people
 11 31 or more but less than two hundred thousand people, and one
 11 32 application shall be approved for a county with a population of
 11 33 less than one hundred thousand people.
 11 34    2.  A sobriety monitoring pilot program shall do all of the
 11 35 following:
 12  1    a.  Require a person who has been charged with, pled guilty
 12  2 to, or been convicted of a violation of section 321J.2 to
 12  3 abstain from all chemical substances for a period of time.
 12  4    b.  Require the person to be subject to testing to determine
 12  5 whether a chemical substance is present in the person's body
 12  6 in the following manner:
 12  7    (1)  At least twice per day at a central location where an
 12  8 immediate sanction can be applied.
 12  9    (2)  Where testing under subparagraph (1) is impractical, by
 12 10 continuous transdermal or electronic monitoring.
 12 11    c.  Apply sanctions when test results definitively, and
 12 12 without presumption, indicate the presence of chemical
 12 13 substances.
 12 14    d.  Require a person participating in the program to pay
 12 15 program costs, including costs of installation, monitoring, and
 12 16 deactivation of any testing devices.
 12 17    e.  Require the person to install an ignition interlock
 12 18 device of a type approved by the commissioner of public safety
 12 19 on all vehicles owned or operated by the person, and require
 12 20 the person to pay the costs associated with the installation
 12 21 and use of the ignition interlock device.
 12 22    3.  A court in a county that has established a pilot program
 12 23 pursuant to this section may order a defendant, as a condition
 12 24 of pretrial release, probation, or bond, to participate in the
 12 25 program.
 12 26    4.  An approved pilot program shall begin on January 15,
 12 27 2017, or upon the effective date of department rules, whichever
 12 28 is earlier, and shall be conducted for a minimum of one year.
 12 29    5.  The department of public health shall adopt rules
 12 30 pursuant to chapter 17A to implement this section including
 12 31 but not limited to provisions relating to applications for,
 12 32 approval of, costs of, and oversight of the pilot programs and
 12 33 reporting requirements for participating counties.
 12 34    6.  The department of public health shall submit a report on
 12 35 the results of the pilot programs and make recommendations to
 13  1 the general assembly by December 15, 2018.
 13  2    7.  For the purposes of this section, "chemical substance"
 13  3 means alcohol, wine, spirits, and beer as defined in section
 13  4 123.3 and controlled substances as defined in section 124.101.
 13  5                           EXPLANATION
 13  6 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
 13  7 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
 13  8    Current law requires a person guilty of operating while
 13  9 intoxicated (OWI) to install an ignition interlock device in
 13 10 the person's vehicle if the person seeks a temporary restricted
 13 11 license, unless the person's alcohol concentration was less
 13 12 than .10 and no accident occurred. This bill strikes that
 13 13 exception, and also requires a person guilty of OWI to install
 13 14 an ignition interlock device in the person's vehicle upon the
 13 15 revocation of the person's driver's license rather than upon
 13 16 the person's application for a temporary restricted license.
 13 17    Under current law, an ignition interlock device is required
 13 18 to be installed in a person's vehicle for the period of time
 13 19 for which the person's temporary restricted license is issued,
 13 20 and up to one additional year after license reinstatement if
 13 21 the person has two or more OWI revocations. The bill requires
 13 22 the permanent installation of an ignition interlock device with
 13 23 two exceptions. If the ignition interlock device was installed
 13 24 as a result of the person's first OWI offense or revocation and
 13 25 a test was obtained, the device shall be uninstalled 180 days
 13 26 after the person's license was revoked, the person last failed
 13 27 a test by the ignition interlock device, or the defendant last
 13 28 failed to maintain the device as required, whichever is latest.
 13 29 If the ignition interlock device was installed as a result of
 13 30 the person's first OWI offense or revocation and a test was
 13 31 refused, the device shall be uninstalled 180 days after the
 13 32 person's license revocation period is over, the person last
 13 33 failed a test by the ignition interlock device, or the person
 13 34 last failed to maintain the device as required, whichever is
 13 35 latest.
 14  1 The bill provides an ignition interlock device shall not
 14  2 be uninstalled if the person has been convicted of a second
 14  3 or subsequent OWI violation, if the person's license has been
 14  4 revoked for a second or subsequent time, or if the person has
 14  5 been convicted of tampering with or circumventing an ignition
 14  6 interlock device.
 14  7    The bill requires the department of transportation (DOT)
 14  8 to assess a monthly ignition interlock user fee to each user
 14  9 of an ignition interlock device. All ignition interlock user
 14 10 fees will be collected by the DOT and deposited in an ignition
 14 11 interlock indigent user fund (IIIUF). The bill requires the
 14 12 DOT to use the moneys in the IIIUF to assist indigent users
 14 13 of ignition interlock devices in paying for the use of the
 14 14 devices. The amount of the monthly ignition interlock user fee
 14 15 shall be set by the DOT so that the moneys in the IIIUF are
 14 16 sufficient to assist all indigent users of ignition interlock
 14 17 devices in paying for the use of the devices.
 14 18    Under the bill, a person is indigent if the person has an
 14 19 income level at or below 125 percent of the U.S. poverty level
 14 20 and the person is unable to pay for the cost of an ignition
 14 21 interlock device. A person is also indigent if the person has
 14 22 an income level greater than 125 percent, but at or below 200
 14 23 percent, of the U.S. poverty level and paying for the ignition
 14 24 interlock device would cause the person substantial hardship.
 14 25    The bill provides for county sobriety monitoring pilot
 14 26 programs. The bill allows the department of public health
 14 27 (DPH), in collaboration with the department of corrections,
 14 28 the department of public safety, and the DOT, to approve
 14 29 applications from counties for countywide sobriety monitoring
 14 30 pilot programs. The programs are to be available 24 hours per
 14 31 day, seven days per week, in an effort to reduce the number
 14 32 of crimes related to OWI.  One application shall be approved
 14 33 for a county with a population of 200,000 people or more, one
 14 34 application shall be approved for a county with a population of
 14 35 100,000 people or more but less than 200,000 people, and one
 15  1 application shall be approved for a county with a population of
 15  2 less than 100,000 people.
 15  3    The programs shall require individuals charged with or
 15  4 convicted of OWI to abstain from all chemical substances for
 15  5 a period of time. The programs are to require testing to
 15  6 determine whether a chemical substance is present at least
 15  7 twice per day at a central location where an immediate sanction
 15  8 can be applied or, where such testing is impractical, by
 15  9 continuous transdermal or electronic monitoring. The programs
 15 10 shall also apply sanctions when test results definitively
 15 11 indicate the presence of a chemical substance. The programs
 15 12 shall require participants to pay program costs and to install
 15 13 an ignition interlock device.
 15 14    A court in a county that has established a pilot program
 15 15 may order a defendant, as a condition of pretrial release,
 15 16 probation, or bond, to participate in the program. Approved
 15 17 pilot programs shall begin January 15, 2017, or upon the
 15 18 effective date of DPH rules, whichever is earlier, and shall
 15 19 be conducted for a minimum of one year. The DPH is to adopt
 15 20 rules to implement the programs, including but not limited to
 15 21 provisions relating to applications for, approval of, costs of,
 15 22 and oversight of the pilot programs and reporting requirements
 15 23 for participating counties. The DPH is directed to submit
 15 24 a report on the results of the pilot programs and make
 15 25 recommendations to the general assembly by December 15, 2018.

 11 21    1.  The department of public health, in collaboration
 11 22 with the department of corrections, the department of public
 11 23 safety, and the department of transportation, may approve an
 11 24 application from a county for a countywide sobriety monitoring
 11 25 pilot program that is available twenty=four hours per day,
 11 26 seven days per week, in an effort to reduce the number of
 11 27 crimes related to operating while intoxicated. One application
 11 28 shall be approved for a county with a population of two hundred
 11 29 thousand people or more, one application shall be approved
 11 30 for a county with a population of one hundred thousand people
 11 31 or more but less than two hundred thousand people, and one
 11 32 application shall be approved for a county with a population of
 11 33 less than one hundred thousand people.
 11 34    2.  A sobriety monitoring pilot program shall do all of the
 11 35 following:
 12  1    a.  Require a person who has been charged with, pled guilty
 12  2 to, or been convicted of a violation of section 321J.2 to
 12  3 abstain from all chemical substances for a period of time.
 12  4    b.  Require the person to be subject to testing to determine
 12  5 whether a chemical substance is present in the person's body
 12  6 in the following manner:
 12  7    (1)  At least twice per day at a central location where an
 12  8 immediate sanction can be applied.
 12  9    (2)  Where testing under subparagraph (1) is impractical, by
 12 10 continuous transdermal or electronic monitoring.
 12 11    c.  Apply sanctions when test results definitively, and
 12 12 without presumption, indicate the presence of chemical
 12 13 substances.
 12 14    d.  Require a person participating in the program to pay
 12 15 program costs, including costs of installation, monitoring, and
 12 16 deactivation of any testing devices.
 12 17    e.  Require the person to install an ignition interlock
 12 18 device of a type approved by the commissioner of public safety
 12 19 on all vehicles owned or operated by the person, and require
 12 20 the person to pay the costs associated with the installation
 12 21 and use of the ignition interlock device.
 12 22    3.  A court in a county that has established a pilot program
 12 23 pursuant to this section may order a defendant, as a condition
 12 24 of pretrial release, probation, or bond, to participate in the
 12 25 program.
 12 26    4.  An approved pilot program shall begin on January 15,
 12 27 2017, or upon the effective date of department rules, whichever
 12 28 is earlier, and shall be conducted for a minimum of one year.
 12 29    5.  The department of public health shall adopt rules
 12 30 pursuant to chapter 17A to implement this section including
 12 31 but not limited to provisions relating to applications for,
 12 32 approval of, costs of, and oversight of the pilot programs and
 12 33 reporting requirements for participating counties.
 12 34    6.  The department of public health shall submit a report on
 12 35 the results of the pilot programs and make recommendations to
 13  1 the general assembly by December 15, 2018.
 13  2    7.  For the purposes of this section, "chemical substance"
 13  3 means alcohol, wine, spirits, and beer as defined in section
 13  4 123.3 and controlled substances as defined in section 124.101.
 13  5                           EXPLANATION
 13  6 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
 13  7 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
 13  8    Current law requires a person guilty of operating while
 13  9 intoxicated (OWI) to install an ignition interlock device in
 13 10 the person's vehicle if the person seeks a temporary restricted
 13 11 license, unless the person's alcohol concentration was less
 13 12 than .10 and no accident occurred. This bill strikes that
 13 13 exception, and also requires a person guilty of OWI to install
 13 14 an ignition interlock device in the person's vehicle upon the
 13 15 revocation of the person's driver's license rather than upon
 13 16 the person's application for a temporary restricted license.
 13 17    Under current law, an ignition interlock device is required
 13 18 to be installed in a person's vehicle for the period of time
 13 19 for which the person's temporary restricted license is issued,
 13 20 and up to one additional year after license reinstatement if
 13 21 the person has two or more OWI revocations. The bill requires
 13 22 the permanent installation of an ignition interlock device with
 13 23 two exceptions. If the ignition interlock device was installed
 13 24 as a result of the person's first OWI offense or revocation and
 13 25 a test was obtained, the device shall be uninstalled 180 days
 13 26 after the person's license was revoked, the person last failed
 13 27 a test by the ignition interlock device, or the defendant last
 13 28 failed to maintain the device as required, whichever is latest.
 13 29 If the ignition interlock device was installed as a result of
 13 30 the person's first OWI offense or revocation and a test was
 13 31 refused, the device shall be uninstalled 180 days after the
 13 32 person's license revocation period is over, the person last
 13 33 failed a test by the ignition interlock device, or the person
 13 34 last failed to maintain the device as required, whichever is
 13 35 latest.
 14  1 The bill provides an ignition interlock device shall not
 14  2 be uninstalled if the person has been convicted of a second
 14  3 or subsequent OWI violation, if the person's license has been
 14  4 revoked for a second or subsequent time, or if the person has
 14  5 been convicted of tampering with or circumventing an ignition
 14  6 interlock device.
 14  7    The bill requires the department of transportation (DOT)
 14  8 to assess a monthly ignition interlock user fee to each user
 14  9 of an ignition interlock device. All ignition interlock user
 14 10 fees will be collected by the DOT and deposited in an ignition
 14 11 interlock indigent user fund (IIIUF). The bill requires the
 14 12 DOT to use the moneys in the IIIUF to assist indigent users
 14 13 of ignition interlock devices in paying for the use of the
 14 14 devices. The amount of the monthly ignition interlock user fee
 14 15 shall be set by the DOT so that the moneys in the IIIUF are
 14 16 sufficient to assist all indigent users of ignition interlock
 14 17 devices in paying for the use of the devices.
 14 18    Under the bill, a person is indigent if the person has an
 14 19 income level at or below 125 percent of the U.S. poverty level
 14 20 and the person is unable to pay for the cost of an ignition
 14 21 interlock device. A person is also indigent if the person has
 14 22 an income level greater than 125 percent, but at or below 200
 14 23 percent, of the U.S. poverty level and paying for the ignition
 14 24 interlock device would cause the person substantial hardship.
 14 25    The bill provides for county sobriety monitoring pilot
 14 26 programs. The bill allows the department of public health
 14 27 (DPH), in collaboration with the department of corrections,
 14 28 the department of public safety, and the DOT, to approve

 14 34 application shall be approved for a county with a population of
 14 35 100,000 people or more but less than 200,000 people, and one
 15  1 application shall be approved for a county with a population of
 15  2 less than 100,000 people.
 15  3    The programs shall require individuals charged with or
 15  4 convicted of OWI to abstain from all chemical substances for
 15  5 a period of time. The programs are to require testing to
 15  6 determine whether a chemical substance is present at least
 15  7 twice per day at a central location where an immediate sanction
 15  8 can be applied or, where such testing is impractical, by
 15  9 continuous transdermal or electronic monitoring. The programs
 15 10 shall also apply sanctions when test results definitively
 15 11 indicate the presence of a chemical substance. The programs
 15 12 shall require participants to pay program costs and to install
 15 13 an ignition interlock device.
 15 14    A court in a county that has established a pilot program
 15 15 may order a defendant, as a condition of pretrial release,
 15 16 probation, or bond, to participate in the program. Approved
 15 17 pilot programs shall begin January 15, 2017, or upon the
 15 18 effective date of DPH rules, whichever is earlier, and shall
 15 19 be conducted for a minimum of one year. The DPH is to adopt
 15 20 rules to implement the programs, including but not limited to
 15 21 provisions relating to applications for, approval of, costs of,
 15 22 and oversight of the pilot programs and reporting requirements
 15 23 for participating counties. The DPH is directed to submit
 15 24 a report on the results of the pilot programs and make
 15 25 recommendations to the general assembly by December 15, 2018.

 11  9 and the department determines that paying for the ignition
 11 10 interlock device would cause the person substantial hardship.
 11 11 In determining whether substantial hardship would result, the
 11 12 department shall consider not only the person's income, but
 11 13 also the person's other assets, including but not limited to
 11 14 cash, stocks, bonds, and any other property.
 11 15    d.  The department shall adopt rules to administer this
 11 16 subsection, including but not limited to the manner used to
 11 17 determine the monthly ignition interlock user fee and the
 11 18 accepted form and manner in which a person may demonstrate
 11 19 indigency.
 11 20    Sec. 15.  SOBRIETY MONITORING PILOT PROGRAMS.
 11 21    1.  The department of public health, in collaboration
 11 22 with the department of corrections, the department of public
 11 23 safety, and the department of transportation, may approve an
 11 24 application from a county for a countywide sobriety monitoring
 11 25 pilot program that is available twenty=four hours per day,
 11 26 seven days per week, in an effort to reduce the number of
 11 27 crimes related to operating while intoxicated. One application
 11 28 shall be approved for a county with a population of two hundred
 11 29 thousand people or more, one application shall be approved
 11 30 for a county with a population of one hundred thousand people
 11 31 or more but less than two hundred thousand people, and one
 11 32 application shall be approved for a county with a population of
 11 33 less than one hundred thousand people.
 11 34    2.  A sobriety monitoring pilot program shall do all of the
 11 35 following:
 12  1    a.  Require a person who has been charged with, pled guilty
 12  2 to, or been convicted of a violation of section 321J.2 to
 12  3 abstain from all chemical substances for a period of time.
 12  4    b.  Require the person to be subject to testing to determine
 12  5 whether a chemical substance is present in the person's body
 12  6 in the following manner:
 12  7    (1)  At least twice per day at a central location where an
 12  8 immediate sanction can be applied.
 12  9    (2)  Where testing under subparagraph (1) is impractical, by
 12 10 continuous transdermal or electronic monitoring.
 12 11    c.  Apply sanctions when test results definitively, and
 12 12 without presumption, indicate the presence of chemical
 12 13 substances.
 12 14    d.  Require a person participating in the program to pay
 12 15 program costs, including costs of installation, monitoring, and
 12 16 deactivation of any testing devices.
 12 17    e.  Require the person to install an ignition interlock
 12 18 device of a type approved by the commissioner of public safety
 12 19 on all vehicles owned or operated by the person, and require
 12 20 the person to pay the costs associated with the installation
 12 21 and use of the ignition interlock device.
 12 22    3.  A court in a county that has established a pilot program
 12 23 pursuant to this section may order a defendant, as a condition
 12 24 of pretrial release, probation, or bond, to participate in the
 12 25 program.
 12 26    4.  An approved pilot program shall begin on January 15,
 12 27 2017, or upon the effective date of department rules, whichever
 12 28 is earlier, and shall be conducted for a minimum of one year.
 12 29    5.  The department of public health shall adopt rules
 12 30 pursuant to chapter 17A to implement this section including
 12 31 but not limited to provisions relating to applications for,
 12 32 approval of, costs of, and oversight of the pilot programs and
 12 33 reporting requirements for participating counties.
 12 34    6.  The department of public health shall submit a report on
 12 35 the results of the pilot programs and make recommendations to
 13  1 the general assembly by December 15, 2018.
 13  2    7.  For the purposes of this section, "chemical substance"
 13  3 means alcohol, wine, spirits, and beer as defined in section
 13  4 123.3 and controlled substances as defined in section 124.101.
 13  5                           EXPLANATION
 13  6 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
 13  7 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
 13  8    Current law requires a person guilty of operating while
 13  9 intoxicated (OWI) to install an ignition interlock device in
 13 10 the person's vehicle if the person seeks a temporary restricted
 13 11 license, unless the person's alcohol concentration was less
 13 12 than .10 and no accident occurred. This bill strikes that
 13 13 exception, and also requires a person guilty of OWI to install
 13 14 an ignition interlock device in the person's vehicle upon the
 13 15 revocation of the person's driver's license rather than upon
 13 16 the person's application for a temporary restricted license.
 13 17    Under current law, an ignition interlock device is required
 13 18 to be installed in a person's vehicle for the period of time
 13 19 for which the person's temporary restricted license is issued,
 13 20 and up to one additional year after license reinstatement if
 13 21 the person has two or more OWI revocations. The bill requires
 13 22 the permanent installation of an ignition interlock device with
 13 23 two exceptions. If the ignition interlock device was installed
 13 24 as a result of the person's first OWI offense or revocation and
 13 25 a test was obtained, the device shall be uninstalled 180 days
 13 26 after the person's license was revoked, the person last failed
 13 27 a test by the ignition interlock device, or the defendant last
 13 28 failed to maintain the device as required, whichever is latest.
 13 29 If the ignition interlock device was installed as a result of
 13 30 the person's first OWI offense or revocation and a test was
 13 31 refused, the device shall be uninstalled 180 days after the
 13 32 person's license revocation period is over, the person last
 13 33 failed a test by the ignition interlock device, or the person
 13 34 last failed to maintain the device as required, whichever is
 13 35 latest.
 14  1 The bill provides an ignition interlock device shall not
 14  2 be uninstalled if the person has been convicted of a second
 14  3 or subsequent OWI violation, if the person's license has been
 14  4 revoked for a second or subsequent time, or if the person has
 14  5 been convicted of tampering with or circumventing an ignition
 14  6 interlock device.
 14  7    The bill requires the department of transportation (DOT)
 14  8 to assess a monthly ignition interlock user fee to each user
 14  9 of an ignition interlock device. All ignition interlock user
 14 10 fees will be collected by the DOT and deposited in an ignition
 14 11 interlock indigent user fund (IIIUF). The bill requires the
 14 12 DOT to use the moneys in the IIIUF to assist indigent users
 14 13 of ignition interlock devices in paying for the use of the
 14 14 devices. The amount of the monthly ignition interlock user fee
 14 15 shall be set by the DOT so that the moneys in the IIIUF are
 14 16 sufficient to assist all indigent users of ignition interlock
 14 17 devices in paying for the use of the devices.
 14 18    Under the bill, a person is indigent if the person has an
 14 19 income level at or below 125 percent of the U.S. poverty level
 14 20 and the person is unable to pay for the cost of an ignition
 14 21 interlock device. A person is also indigent if the person has
 14 22 an income level greater than 125 percent, but at or below 200
 14 23 percent, of the U.S. poverty level and paying for the ignition
 14 24 interlock device would cause the person substantial hardship.
 14 25    The bill provides for county sobriety monitoring pilot
 14 26 programs. The bill allows the department of public health
 14 27 (DPH), in collaboration with the department of corrections,
 14 28 the department of public safety, and the DOT, to approve
 14 29 applications from counties for countywide sobriety monitoring
 14 30 pilot programs. The programs are to be available 24 hours per
 14 31 day, seven days per week, in an effort to reduce the number
 14 32 of crimes related to OWI.  One application shall be approved
 14 33 for a county with a population of 200,000 people or more, one
 14 34 application shall be approved for a county with a population of
 14 35 100,000 people or more but less than 200,000 people, and one
 15  1 application shall be approved for a county with a population of
 15  2 less than 100,000 people.
 15  3    The programs shall require individuals charged with or
 15  4 convicted of OWI to abstain from all chemical substances for
 15  5 a period of time. The programs are to require testing to
 15  6 determine whether a chemical substance is present at least
 15  7 twice per day at a central location where an immediate sanction
 15  8 can be applied or, where such testing is impractical, by
 15  9 continuous transdermal or electronic monitoring. The programs
 15 10 shall also apply sanctions when test results definitively
 15 11 indicate the presence of a chemical substance. The programs
 15 12 shall require participants to pay program costs and to install
 15 13 an ignition interlock device.
 15 14    A court in a county that has established a pilot program
 15 15 may order a defendant, as a condition of pretrial release,
 15 16 probation, or bond, to participate in the program. Approved
 15 17 pilot programs shall begin January 15, 2017, or upon the
 15 18 effective date of DPH rules, whichever is earlier, and shall
 15 19 be conducted for a minimum of one year. The DPH is to adopt
 15 20 rules to implement the programs, including but not limited to
 15 21 provisions relating to applications for, approval of, costs of,
 15 22 and oversight of the pilot programs and reporting requirements
 15 23 for participating counties. The DPH is directed to submit
 15 24 a report on the results of the pilot programs and make
 15 25 recommendations to the general assembly by December 15, 2018.

 11 32 application shall be approved for a county with a population of
 11 33 less than one hundred thousand people.
 11 34    2.  A sobriety monitoring pilot program shall do all of the
 11 35 following:

 12 17    e.  Require the person to install an ignition interlock
 12 18 device of a type approved by the commissioner of public safety
 12 19 on all vehicles owned or operated by the person, and require
 12 20 the person to pay the costs associated with the installation
 12 21 and use of the ignition interlock device.
 12 22    3.  A court in a county that has established a pilot program
 12 23 pursuant to this section may order a defendant, as a condition
 12 24 of pretrial release, probation, or bond, to participate in the
 12 25 program.
 12 26    4.  An approved pilot program shall begin on January 15,
 12 27 2017, or upon the effective date of department rules, whichever
 12 28 is earlier, and shall be conducted for a minimum of one year.

 13  4 123.3 and controlled substances as defined in section 124.101.
 13  5                           EXPLANATION
 13  6 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
 13  7 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
 13  8    Current law requires a person guilty of operating while
 13  9 intoxicated (OWI) to install an ignition interlock device in
 13 10 the person's vehicle if the person seeks a temporary restricted
 13 11 license, unless the person's alcohol concentration was less
 13 12 than .10 and no accident occurred. This bill strikes that
 13 13 exception, and also requires a person guilty of OWI to install
 13 14 an ignition interlock device in the person's vehicle upon the
 13 15 revocation of the person's driver's license rather than upon

 13 18 to be installed in a person's vehicle for the period of time
 13 19 for which the person's temporary restricted license is issued,

 13 32 person's license revocation period is over, the person last
 13 33 failed a test by the ignition interlock device, or the person
 13 34 last failed to maintain the device as required, whichever is
 13 35 latest.
 14  1 The bill provides an ignition interlock device shall not
 14  2 be uninstalled if the person has been convicted of a second
 14  3 or subsequent OWI violation, if the person's license has been
 14  4 revoked for a second or subsequent time, or if the person has

 14  7    The bill requires the department of transportation (DOT)
 14  8 to assess a monthly ignition interlock user fee to each user
 14  9 of an ignition interlock device. All ignition interlock user
 14 10 fees will be collected by the DOT and deposited in an ignition

 14 15 shall be set by the DOT so that the moneys in the IIIUF are
 14 16 sufficient to assist all indigent users of ignition interlock
 14 17 devices in paying for the use of the devices.
 14 18    Under the bill, a person is indigent if the person has an
 14 19 income level at or below 125 percent of the U.S. poverty level
 14 20 and the person is unable to pay for the cost of an ignition
 14 21 interlock device. A person is also indigent if the person has
 14 22 an income level greater than 125 percent, but at or below 200
 14 23 percent, of the U.S. poverty level and paying for the ignition
 14 24 interlock device would cause the person substantial hardship.

 13 25 a test was obtained, the device shall be uninstalled 180 days
 13 26 after the person's license was revoked, the person last failed
 13 27 a test by the ignition interlock device, or the defendant last
 13 28 failed to maintain the device as required, whichever is latest.
 13 29 If the ignition interlock device was installed as a result of
 13 30 the person's first OWI offense or revocation and a test was
 13 31 refused, the device shall be uninstalled 180 days after the
 13 32 person's license revocation period is over, the person last
 13 33 failed a test by the ignition interlock device, or the person
 13 34 last failed to maintain the device as required, whichever is
 13 35 latest.
 14  1 The bill provides an ignition interlock device shall not
 14  2 be uninstalled if the person has been convicted of a second
 14  3 or subsequent OWI violation, if the person's license has been
 14  4 revoked for a second or subsequent time, or if the person has
 14  5 been convicted of tampering with or circumventing an ignition
 14  6 interlock device.
 14  7    The bill requires the department of transportation (DOT)
 14  8 to assess a monthly ignition interlock user fee to each user
 14  9 of an ignition interlock device. All ignition interlock user
 14 10 fees will be collected by the DOT and deposited in an ignition
 14 11 interlock indigent user fund (IIIUF). The bill requires the
 14 12 DOT to use the moneys in the IIIUF to assist indigent users
 14 13 of ignition interlock devices in paying for the use of the
 14 14 devices. The amount of the monthly ignition interlock user fee
 14 15 shall be set by the DOT so that the moneys in the IIIUF are
 14 16 sufficient to assist all indigent users of ignition interlock
 14 17 devices in paying for the use of the devices.
 14 18    Under the bill, a person is indigent if the person has an
 14 19 income level at or below 125 percent of the U.S. poverty level
 14 20 and the person is unable to pay for the cost of an ignition
 14 21 interlock device. A person is also indigent if the person has
 14 22 an income level greater than 125 percent, but at or below 200
 14 23 percent, of the U.S. poverty level and paying for the ignition
 14 24 interlock device would cause the person substantial hardship.
 14 25    The bill provides for county sobriety monitoring pilot
 14 26 programs. The bill allows the department of public health
 14 27 (DPH), in collaboration with the department of corrections,
 14 28 the department of public safety, and the DOT, to approve
 14 29 applications from counties for countywide sobriety monitoring
 14 30 pilot programs. The programs are to be available 24 hours per
 14 31 day, seven days per week, in an effort to reduce the number
 14 32 of crimes related to OWI.  One application shall be approved
 14 33 for a county with a population of 200,000 people or more, one
 14 34 application shall be approved for a county with a population of
 14 35 100,000 people or more but less than 200,000 people, and one
 15  1 application shall be approved for a county with a population of
 15  2 less than 100,000 people.
 15  3    The programs shall require individuals charged with or
 15  4 convicted of OWI to abstain from all chemical substances for
 15  5 a period of time. The programs are to require testing to
 15  6 determine whether a chemical substance is present at least
 15  7 twice per day at a central location where an immediate sanction
 15  8 can be applied or, where such testing is impractical, by
 15  9 continuous transdermal or electronic monitoring. The programs
 15 10 shall also apply sanctions when test results definitively
 15 11 indicate the presence of a chemical substance. The programs
 15 12 shall require participants to pay program costs and to install
 15 13 an ignition interlock device.
 15 14    A court in a county that has established a pilot program
 15 15 may order a defendant, as a condition of pretrial release,
 15 16 probation, or bond, to participate in the program. Approved
 15 17 pilot programs shall begin January 15, 2017, or upon the
 15 18 effective date of DPH rules, whichever is earlier, and shall
 15 19 be conducted for a minimum of one year. The DPH is to adopt
 15 20 rules to implement the programs, including but not limited to
 15 21 provisions relating to applications for, approval of, costs of,
 15 22 and oversight of the pilot programs and reporting requirements
 15 23 for participating counties. The DPH is directed to submit
 15 24 a report on the results of the pilot programs and make
 15 25 recommendations to the general assembly by December 15, 2018.

 11 20    Sec. 15.  SOBRIETY MONITORING PILOT PROGRAMS.
 11 21    1.  The department of public health, in collaboration
 11 22 with the department of corrections, the department of public
 11 23 safety, and the department of transportation, may approve an
 11 24 application from a county for a countywide sobriety monitoring
 11 25 pilot program that is available twenty=four hours per day,
 11 26 seven days per week, in an effort to reduce the number of
 11 27 crimes related to operating while intoxicated. One application
 11 28 shall be approved for a county with a population of two hundred
 11 29 thousand people or more, one application shall be approved
 11 30 for a county with a population of one hundred thousand people
 11 31 or more but less than two hundred thousand people, and one
 11 32 application shall be approved for a county with a population of
 11 33 less than one hundred thousand people.
 11 34    2.  A sobriety monitoring pilot program shall do all of the
 11 35 following:
 12  1    a.  Require a person who has been charged with, pled guilty
 12  2 to, or been convicted of a violation of section 321J.2 to
 12  3 abstain from all chemical substances for a period of time.
 12  4    b.  Require the person to be subject to testing to determine
 12  5 whether a chemical substance is present in the person's body
 12  6 in the following manner:
 12  7    (1)  At least twice per day at a central location where an
 12  8 immediate sanction can be applied.
 12  9    (2)  Where testing under subparagraph (1) is impractical, by
 12 10 continuous transdermal or electronic monitoring.
 12 11    c.  Apply sanctions when test results definitively, and
 12 12 without presumption, indicate the presence of chemical
 12 13 substances.
 12 14    d.  Require a person participating in the program to pay
 12 15 program costs, including costs of installation, monitoring, and
 12 16 deactivation of any testing devices.
 12 17    e.  Require the person to install an ignition interlock
 12 18 device of a type approved by the commissioner of public safety
 12 19 on all vehicles owned or operated by the person, and require
 12 20 the person to pay the costs associated with the installation
 12 21 and use of the ignition interlock device.
 12 22    3.  A court in a county that has established a pilot program
 12 23 pursuant to this section may order a defendant, as a condition
 12 24 of pretrial release, probation, or bond, to participate in the
 12 25 program.
 12 26    4.  An approved pilot program shall begin on January 15,
 12 27 2017, or upon the effective date of department rules, whichever
 12 28 is earlier, and shall be conducted for a minimum of one year.
 12 29    5.  The department of public health shall adopt rules
 12 30 pursuant to chapter 17A to implement this section including
 12 31 but not limited to provisions relating to applications for,
 12 32 approval of, costs of, and oversight of the pilot programs and
 12 33 reporting requirements for participating counties.
 12 34    6.  The department of public health shall submit a report on
 12 35 the results of the pilot programs and make recommendations to
 13  1 the general assembly by December 15, 2018.
 13  2    7.  For the purposes of this section, "chemical substance"
 13  3 means alcohol, wine, spirits, and beer as defined in section
 13  4 123.3 and controlled substances as defined in section 124.101.
 13  5                           EXPLANATION
 13  6 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
 13  7 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
 13  8    Current law requires a person guilty of operating while
 13  9 intoxicated (OWI) to install an ignition interlock device in
 13 10 the person's vehicle if the person seeks a temporary restricted
 13 11 license, unless the person's alcohol concentration was less
 13 12 than .10 and no accident occurred. This bill strikes that
 13 13 exception, and also requires a person guilty of OWI to install
 13 14 an ignition interlock device in the person's vehicle upon the
 13 15 revocation of the person's driver's license rather than upon
 13 16 the person's application for a temporary restricted license.
 13 17    Under current law, an ignition interlock device is required
 13 18 to be installed in a person's vehicle for the period of time
 13 19 for which the person's temporary restricted license is issued,
 13 20 and up to one additional year after license reinstatement if
 13 21 the person has two or more OWI revocations. The bill requires
 13 22 the permanent installation of an ignition interlock device with
 13 23 two exceptions. If the ignition interlock device was installed
 13 24 as a result of the person's first OWI offense or revocation and
 13 25 a test was obtained, the device shall be uninstalled 180 days
 13 26 after the person's license was revoked, the person last failed
 13 27 a test by the ignition interlock device, or the defendant last
 13 28 failed to maintain the device as required, whichever is latest.
 13 29 If the ignition interlock device was installed as a result of
 13 30 the person's first OWI offense or revocation and a test was
 13 31 refused, the device shall be uninstalled 180 days after the
 13 32 person's license revocation period is over, the person last
 13 33 failed a test by the ignition interlock device, or the person
 13 34 last failed to maintain the device as required, whichever is
 13 35 latest.
 14  1 The bill provides an ignition interlock device shall not
 14  2 be uninstalled if the person has been convicted of a second
 14  3 or subsequent OWI violation, if the person's license has been
 14  4 revoked for a second or subsequent time, or if the person has
 14  5 been convicted of tampering with or circumventing an ignition
 14  6 interlock device.
 14  7    The bill requires the department of transportation (DOT)
 14  8 to assess a monthly ignition interlock user fee to each user
 14  9 of an ignition interlock device. All ignition interlock user
 14 10 fees will be collected by the DOT and deposited in an ignition
 14 11 interlock indigent user fund (IIIUF). The bill requires the
 14 12 DOT to use the moneys in the IIIUF to assist indigent users
 14 13 of ignition interlock devices in paying for the use of the
 14 14 devices. The amount of the monthly ignition interlock user fee
 14 15 shall be set by the DOT so that the moneys in the IIIUF are
 14 16 sufficient to assist all indigent users of ignition interlock
 14 17 devices in paying for the use of the devices.
 14 18    Under the bill, a person is indigent if the person has an
 14 19 income level at or below 125 percent of the U.S. poverty level
 14 20 and the person is unable to pay for the cost of an ignition
 14 21 interlock device. A person is also indigent if the person has
 14 22 an income level greater than 125 percent, but at or below 200
 14 23 percent, of the U.S. poverty level and paying for the ignition
 14 24 interlock device would cause the person substantial hardship.
 14 25    The bill provides for county sobriety monitoring pilot
 14 26 programs. The bill allows the department of public health
 14 27 (DPH), in collaboration with the department of corrections,
 14 28 the department of public safety, and the DOT, to approve
 14 29 applications from counties for countywide sobriety monitoring
 14 30 pilot programs. The programs are to be available 24 hours per
 14 31 day, seven days per week, in an effort to reduce the number
 14 32 of crimes related to OWI.  One application shall be approved
 14 33 for a county with a population of 200,000 people or more, one
 14 34 application shall be approved for a county with a population of
 14 35 100,000 people or more but less than 200,000 people, and one
 15  1 application shall be approved for a county with a population of
 15  2 less than 100,000 people.
 15  3    The programs shall require individuals charged with or
 15  4 convicted of OWI to abstain from all chemical substances for
 15  5 a period of time. The programs are to require testing to
 15  6 determine whether a chemical substance is present at least
 15  7 twice per day at a central location where an immediate sanction
 15  8 can be applied or, where such testing is impractical, by
 15  9 continuous transdermal or electronic monitoring. The programs
 15 10 shall also apply sanctions when test results definitively
 15 11 indicate the presence of a chemical substance. The programs
 15 12 shall require participants to pay program costs and to install
 15 13 an ignition interlock device.
 15 14    A court in a county that has established a pilot program
 15 15 may order a defendant, as a condition of pretrial release,
 15 16 probation, or bond, to participate in the program. Approved
 15 17 pilot programs shall begin January 15, 2017, or upon the
 15 18 effective date of DPH rules, whichever is earlier, and shall
 15 19 be conducted for a minimum of one year. The DPH is to adopt
 15 20 rules to implement the programs, including but not limited to
 15 21 provisions relating to applications for, approval of, costs of,
 15 22 and oversight of the pilot programs and reporting requirements
 15 23 for participating counties. The DPH is directed to submit
 15 24 a report on the results of the pilot programs and make
 15 25 recommendations to the general assembly by December 15, 2018.

 11 31 or more but less than two hundred thousand people, and one
 11 32 application shall be approved for a county with a population of
 11 33 less than one hundred thousand people.
 11 34    2.  A sobriety monitoring pilot program shall do all of the
 11 35 following:
 12  1    a.  Require a person who has been charged with, pled guilty
 12  2 to, or been convicted of a violation of section 321J.2 to
 12  3 abstain from all chemical substances for a period of time.
 12  4    b.  Require the person to be subject to testing to determine

 12 17    e.  Require the person to install an ignition interlock
 12 18 device of a type approved by the commissioner of public safety
 12 19 on all vehicles owned or operated by the person, and require
 12 20 the person to pay the costs associated with the installation
 12 21 and use of the ignition interlock device.

 12 23 pursuant to this section may order a defendant, as a condition
 12 24 of pretrial release, probation, or bond, to participate in the
 12 25 program.
 12 26    4.  An approved pilot program shall begin on January 15,
 12 27 2017, or upon the effective date of department rules, whichever
 12 28 is earlier, and shall be conducted for a minimum of one year.
 12 29    5.  The department of public health shall adopt rules

 12 34    6.  The department of public health shall submit a report on
 12 35 the results of the pilot programs and make recommendations to
 13  1 the general assembly by December 15, 2018.
 13  2    7.  For the purposes of this section, "chemical substance"
 13  3 means alcohol, wine, spirits, and beer as defined in section
 13  4 123.3 and controlled substances as defined in section 124.101.

 11 29 thousand people or more, one application shall be approved
 11 30 for a county with a population of one hundred thousand people
 11 31 or more but less than two hundred thousand people, and one
 11 32 application shall be approved for a county with a population of
 11 33 less than one hundred thousand people.
 11 34    2.  A sobriety monitoring pilot program shall do all of the
 11 35 following:
 12  1    a.  Require a person who has been charged with, pled guilty
 12  2 to, or been convicted of a violation of section 321J.2 to
 12  3 abstain from all chemical substances for a period of time.
 12  4    b.  Require the person to be subject to testing to determine
 12  5 whether a chemical substance is present in the person's body
 12  6 in the following manner:
 12  7    (1)  At least twice per day at a central location where an
 12  8 immediate sanction can be applied.
 12  9    (2)  Where testing under subparagraph (1) is impractical, by
 12 10 continuous transdermal or electronic monitoring.
 12 11    c.  Apply sanctions when test results definitively, and
 12 12 without presumption, indicate the presence of chemical
 12 13 substances.
 12 14    d.  Require a person participating in the program to pay
 12 15 program costs, including costs of installation, monitoring, and

 12 21 and use of the ignition interlock device.
 12 22    3.  A court in a county that has established a pilot program
 12 23 pursuant to this section may order a defendant, as a condition
 12 24 of pretrial release, probation, or bond, to participate in the
 12 25 program.
 12 26    4.  An approved pilot program shall begin on January 15,

 12 34    6.  The department of public health shall submit a report on
 12 35 the results of the pilot programs and make recommendations to
 13  1 the general assembly by December 15, 2018.
 13  2    7.  For the purposes of this section, "chemical substance"
 13  3 means alcohol, wine, spirits, and beer as defined in section
 13  4 123.3 and controlled substances as defined in section 124.101.
 13  5                           EXPLANATION
 13  6 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
 13  7 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
 13  8    Current law requires a person guilty of operating while
 13  9 intoxicated (OWI) to install an ignition interlock device in
 13 10 the person's vehicle if the person seeks a temporary restricted
 13 11 license, unless the person's alcohol concentration was less
 13 12 than .10 and no accident occurred. This bill strikes that
 13 13 exception, and also requires a person guilty of OWI to install
 13 14 an ignition interlock device in the person's vehicle upon the
 13 15 revocation of the person's driver's license rather than upon
 13 16 the person's application for a temporary restricted license.
 13 17    Under current law, an ignition interlock device is required
 13 18 to be installed in a person's vehicle for the period of time
 13 19 for which the person's temporary restricted license is issued,
 13 20 and up to one additional year after license reinstatement if
 13 21 the person has two or more OWI revocations. The bill requires
 13 22 the permanent installation of an ignition interlock device with
 13 23 two exceptions. If the ignition interlock device was installed
 13 24 as a result of the person's first OWI offense or revocation and
 13 25 a test was obtained, the device shall be uninstalled 180 days
 13 26 after the person's license was revoked, the person last failed
 13 27 a test by the ignition interlock device, or the defendant last
 13 28 failed to maintain the device as required, whichever is latest.
 13 29 If the ignition interlock device was installed as a result of
 13 30 the person's first OWI offense or revocation and a test was
 13 31 refused, the device shall be uninstalled 180 days after the
 13 32 person's license revocation period is over, the person last
 13 33 failed a test by the ignition interlock device, or the person
 13 34 last failed to maintain the device as required, whichever is
 13 35 latest.
 14  1 The bill provides an ignition interlock device shall not
 14  2 be uninstalled if the person has been convicted of a second
 14  3 or subsequent OWI violation, if the person's license has been
 14  4 revoked for a second or subsequent time, or if the person has
 14  5 been convicted of tampering with or circumventing an ignition
 14  6 interlock device.
 14  7    The bill requires the department of transportation (DOT)
 14  8 to assess a monthly ignition interlock user fee to each user
 14  9 of an ignition interlock device. All ignition interlock user
 14 10 fees will be collected by the DOT and deposited in an ignition
 14 11 interlock indigent user fund (IIIUF). The bill requires the
 14 12 DOT to use the moneys in the IIIUF to assist indigent users
 14 13 of ignition interlock devices in paying for the use of the
 14 14 devices. The amount of the monthly ignition interlock user fee
 14 15 shall be set by the DOT so that the moneys in the IIIUF are
 14 16 sufficient to assist all indigent users of ignition interlock
 14 17 devices in paying for the use of the devices.
 14 18    Under the bill, a person is indigent if the person has an
 14 19 income level at or below 125 percent of the U.S. poverty level
 14 20 and the person is unable to pay for the cost of an ignition
 14 21 interlock device. A person is also indigent if the person has
 14 22 an income level greater than 125 percent, but at or below 200
 14 23 percent, of the U.S. poverty level and paying for the ignition
 14 24 interlock device would cause the person substantial hardship.
 14 25    The bill provides for county sobriety monitoring pilot
 14 26 programs. The bill allows the department of public health
 14 27 (DPH), in collaboration with the department of corrections,
 14 28 the department of public safety, and the DOT, to approve
 14 29 applications from counties for countywide sobriety monitoring
 14 30 pilot programs. The programs are to be available 24 hours per
 14 31 day, seven days per week, in an effort to reduce the number
 14 32 of crimes related to OWI.  One application shall be approved
 14 33 for a county with a population of 200,000 people or more, one
 14 34 application shall be approved for a county with a population of
 14 35 100,000 people or more but less than 200,000 people, and one
 15  1 application shall be approved for a county with a population of
 15  2 less than 100,000 people.
 15  3    The programs shall require individuals charged with or
 15  4 convicted of OWI to abstain from all chemical substances for
 15  5 a period of time. The programs are to require testing to
 15  6 determine whether a chemical substance is present at least
 15  7 twice per day at a central location where an immediate sanction
 15  8 can be applied or, where such testing is impractical, by
 15  9 continuous transdermal or electronic monitoring. The programs
 15 10 shall also apply sanctions when test results definitively
 15 11 indicate the presence of a chemical substance. The programs
 15 12 shall require participants to pay program costs and to install
 15 13 an ignition interlock device.
 15 14    A court in a county that has established a pilot program
 15 15 may order a defendant, as a condition of pretrial release,
 15 16 probation, or bond, to participate in the program. Approved
 15 17 pilot programs shall begin January 15, 2017, or upon the
 15 18 effective date of DPH rules, whichever is earlier, and shall
 15 19 be conducted for a minimum of one year. The DPH is to adopt
 15 20 rules to implement the programs, including but not limited to
 15 21 provisions relating to applications for, approval of, costs of,
 15 22 and oversight of the pilot programs and reporting requirements
 15 23 for participating counties. The DPH is directed to submit
 15 24 a report on the results of the pilot programs and make
 15 25 recommendations to the general assembly by December 15, 2018.

 11 15    d.  The department shall adopt rules to administer this
 11 16 subsection, including but not limited to the manner used to
 11 17 determine the monthly ignition interlock user fee and the
 11 18 accepted form and manner in which a person may demonstrate
 11 19 indigency.
 11 20    Sec. 15.  SOBRIETY MONITORING PILOT PROGRAMS.
 11 21    1.  The department of public health, in collaboration
 11 22 with the department of corrections, the department of public
 11 23 safety, and the department of transportation, may approve an
 11 24 application from a county for a countywide sobriety monitoring
 11 25 pilot program that is available twenty=four hours per day,
 11 26 seven days per week, in an effort to reduce the number of
 11 27 crimes related to operating while intoxicated. One application
 11 28 shall be approved for a county with a population of two hundred
 11 29 thousand people or more, one application shall be approved
 11 30 for a county with a population of one hundred thousand people
 11 31 or more but less than two hundred thousand people, and one
 11 32 application shall be approved for a county with a population of
 11 33 less than one hundred thousand people.
 11 34    2.  A sobriety monitoring pilot program shall do all of the
 11 35 following:
 12  1    a.  Require a person who has been charged with, pled guilty
 12  2 to, or been convicted of a violation of section 321J.2 to
 12  3 abstain from all chemical substances for a period of time.
 12  4    b.  Require the person to be subject to testing to determine
 12  5 whether a chemical substance is present in the person's body
 12  6 in the following manner:

 12 12 without presumption, indicate the presence of chemical
 12 13 substances.
 12 14    d.  Require a person participating in the program to pay
 12 15 program costs, including costs of installation, monitoring, and
 12 16 deactivation of any testing devices.
 12 17    e.  Require the person to install an ignition interlock
 12 18 device of a type approved by the commissioner of public safety
 12 19 on all vehicles owned or operated by the person, and require
 12 20 the person to pay the costs associated with the installation
 12 21 and use of the ignition interlock device.
 12 22    3.  A court in a county that has established a pilot program
 12 23 pursuant to this section may order a defendant, as a condition
 12 24 of pretrial release, probation, or bond, to participate in the
 12 25 program.
 12 26    4.  An approved pilot program shall begin on January 15,

 13  5                           EXPLANATION
 13  6 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
 13  7 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
 13  8    Current law requires a person guilty of operating while
 13  9 intoxicated (OWI) to install an ignition interlock device in
 13 10 the person's vehicle if the person seeks a temporary restricted
 13 11 license, unless the person's alcohol concentration was less

 13 33 failed a test by the ignition interlock device, or the person
 13 34 last failed to maintain the device as required, whichever is
 13 35 latest.
 14  1 The bill provides an ignition interlock device shall not
 14  2 be uninstalled if the person has been convicted of a second
 14  3 or subsequent OWI violation, if the person's license has been
 14  4 revoked for a second or subsequent time, or if the person has

 14 19 income level at or below 125 percent of the U.S. poverty level
 14 20 and the person is unable to pay for the cost of an ignition
 14 21 interlock device. A person is also indigent if the person has

 14 19 income level at or below 125 percent of the U.S. poverty level
 14 20 and the person is unable to pay for the cost of an ignition
 14 21 interlock device. A person is also indigent if the person has
 14 22 an income level greater than 125 percent, but at or below 200
 14 23 percent, of the U.S. poverty level and paying for the ignition
 14 24 interlock device would cause the person substantial hardship.
 14 25    The bill provides for county sobriety monitoring pilot
 14 26 programs. The bill allows the department of public health
 14 27 (DPH), in collaboration with the department of corrections,
 14 28 the department of public safety, and the DOT, to approve
 14 29 applications from counties for countywide sobriety monitoring
 14 30 pilot programs. The programs are to be available 24 hours per
 14 31 day, seven days per week, in an effort to reduce the number
 14 32 of crimes related to OWI.  One application shall be approved
 14 33 for a county with a population of 200,000 people or more, one
 14 34 application shall be approved for a county with a population of
 14 35 100,000 people or more but less than 200,000 people, and one
 15  1 application shall be approved for a county with a population of
 15  2 less than 100,000 people.
 15  3    The programs shall require individuals charged with or
 15  4 convicted of OWI to abstain from all chemical substances for
 15  5 a period of time. The programs are to require testing to
 15  6 determine whether a chemical substance is present at least
 15  7 twice per day at a central location where an immediate sanction
 15  8 can be applied or, where such testing is impractical, by
 15  9 continuous transdermal or electronic monitoring. The programs
 15 10 shall also apply sanctions when test results definitively
 15 11 indicate the presence of a chemical substance. The programs
 15 12 shall require participants to pay program costs and to install
 15 13 an ignition interlock device.
 15 14    A court in a county that has established a pilot program
 15 15 may order a defendant, as a condition of pretrial release,
 15 16 probation, or bond, to participate in the program. Approved
 15 17 pilot programs shall begin January 15, 2017, or upon the
 15 18 effective date of DPH rules, whichever is earlier, and shall
 15 19 be conducted for a minimum of one year. The DPH is to adopt
 15 20 rules to implement the programs, including but not limited to
 15 21 provisions relating to applications for, approval of, costs of,
 15 22 and oversight of the pilot programs and reporting requirements
 15 23 for participating counties. The DPH is directed to submit
 15 24 a report on the results of the pilot programs and make
 15 25 recommendations to the general assembly by December 15, 2018.

 11 20    Sec. 15.  SOBRIETY MONITORING PILOT PROGRAMS.
 11 21    1.  The department of public health, in collaboration
 11 22 with the department of corrections, the department of public
 11 23 safety, and the department of transportation, may approve an
 11 24 application from a county for a countywide sobriety monitoring
 11 25 pilot program that is available twenty=four hours per day,
 11 26 seven days per week, in an effort to reduce the number of
 11 27 crimes related to operating while intoxicated. One application
 11 28 shall be approved for a county with a population of two hundred
 11 29 thousand people or more, one application shall be approved

 12  2 to, or been convicted of a violation of section 321J.2 to
 12  3 abstain from all chemical substances for a period of time.
 12  4    b.  Require the person to be subject to testing to determine
 12  5 whether a chemical substance is present in the person's body
 12  6 in the following manner:
 12  7    (1)  At least twice per day at a central location where an
 12  8 immediate sanction can be applied.
 12  9    (2)  Where testing under subparagraph (1) is impractical, by
 12 10 continuous transdermal or electronic monitoring.
 12 11    c.  Apply sanctions when test results definitively, and
 12 12 without presumption, indicate the presence of chemical
 12 13 substances.
 12 14    d.  Require a person participating in the program to pay
 12 15 program costs, including costs of installation, monitoring, and
 12 16 deactivation of any testing devices.
 12 17    e.  Require the person to install an ignition interlock
 12 18 device of a type approved by the commissioner of public safety
 12 19 on all vehicles owned or operated by the person, and require
 12 20 the person to pay the costs associated with the installation
 12 21 and use of the ignition interlock device.
 12 22    3.  A court in a county that has established a pilot program
 12 23 pursuant to this section may order a defendant, as a condition
 12 24 of pretrial release, probation, or bond, to participate in the
 12 25 program.
 12 26    4.  An approved pilot program shall begin on January 15,
 12 27 2017, or upon the effective date of department rules, whichever
 12 28 is earlier, and shall be conducted for a minimum of one year.
 12 29    5.  The department of public health shall adopt rules
 12 30 pursuant to chapter 17A to implement this section including
 12 31 but not limited to provisions relating to applications for,
 12 32 approval of, costs of, and oversight of the pilot programs and
 12 33 reporting requirements for participating counties.
 12 34    6.  The department of public health shall submit a report on
 12 35 the results of the pilot programs and make recommendations to
 13  1 the general assembly by December 15, 2018.
 13  2    7.  For the purposes of this section, "chemical substance"
 13  3 means alcohol, wine, spirits, and beer as defined in section
 13  4 123.3 and controlled substances as defined in section 124.101.
 13  5                           EXPLANATION
 13  6 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
 13  7 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
 13  8    Current law requires a person guilty of operating while
 13  9 intoxicated (OWI) to install an ignition interlock device in
 13 10 the person's vehicle if the person seeks a temporary restricted
 13 11 license, unless the person's alcohol concentration was less
 13 12 than .10 and no accident occurred. This bill strikes that
 13 13 exception, and also requires a person guilty of OWI to install
 13 14 an ignition interlock device in the person's vehicle upon the
 13 15 revocation of the person's driver's license rather than upon
 13 16 the person's application for a temporary restricted license.
 13 17    Under current law, an ignition interlock device is required
 13 18 to be installed in a person's vehicle for the period of time
 13 19 for which the person's temporary restricted license is issued,
 13 20 and up to one additional year after license reinstatement if
 13 21 the person has two or more OWI revocations. The bill requires
 13 22 the permanent installation of an ignition interlock device with
 13 23 two exceptions. If the ignition interlock device was installed
 13 24 as a result of the person's first OWI offense or revocation and
 13 25 a test was obtained, the device shall be uninstalled 180 days
 13 26 after the person's license was revoked, the person last failed
 13 27 a test by the ignition interlock device, or the defendant last
 13 28 failed to maintain the device as required, whichever is latest.
 13 29 If the ignition interlock device was installed as a result of
 13 30 the person's first OWI offense or revocation and a test was
 13 31 refused, the device shall be uninstalled 180 days after the
 13 32 person's license revocation period is over, the person last
 13 33 failed a test by the ignition interlock device, or the person
 13 34 last failed to maintain the device as required, whichever is
 13 35 latest.
 14  1 The bill provides an ignition interlock device shall not
 14  2 be uninstalled if the person has been convicted of a second
 14  3 or subsequent OWI violation, if the person's license has been
 14  4 revoked for a second or subsequent time, or if the person has
 14  5 been convicted of tampering with or circumventing an ignition
 14  6 interlock device.
 14  7    The bill requires the department of transportation (DOT)
 14  8 to assess a monthly ignition interlock user fee to each user
 14  9 of an ignition interlock device. All ignition interlock user
 14 10 fees will be collected by the DOT and deposited in an ignition
 14 11 interlock indigent user fund (IIIUF). The bill requires the
 14 12 DOT to use the moneys in the IIIUF to assist indigent users
 14 13 of ignition interlock devices in paying for the use of the
 14 14 devices. The amount of the monthly ignition interlock user fee
 14 15 shall be set by the DOT so that the moneys in the IIIUF are
 14 16 sufficient to assist all indigent users of ignition interlock
 14 17 devices in paying for the use of the devices.
 14 18    Under the bill, a person is indigent if the person has an
 14 19 income level at or below 125 percent of the U.S. poverty level
 14 20 and the person is unable to pay for the cost of an ignition
 14 21 interlock device. A person is also indigent if the person has
 14 22 an income level greater than 125 percent, but at or below 200
 14 23 percent, of the U.S. poverty level and paying for the ignition
 14 24 interlock device would cause the person substantial hardship.
 14 25    The bill provides for county sobriety monitoring pilot
 14 26 programs. The bill allows the department of public health
 14 27 (DPH), in collaboration with the department of corrections,
 14 28 the department of public safety, and the DOT, to approve

 14 34 application shall be approved for a county with a population of
 14 35 100,000 people or more but less than 200,000 people, and one
 15  1 application shall be approved for a county with a population of
 15  2 less than 100,000 people.
 15  3    The programs shall require individuals charged with or
 15  4 convicted of OWI to abstain from all chemical substances for
 15  5 a period of time. The programs are to require testing to
 15  6 determine whether a chemical substance is present at least
 15  7 twice per day at a central location where an immediate sanction
 15  8 can be applied or, where such testing is impractical, by
 15  9 continuous transdermal or electronic monitoring. The programs
 15 10 shall also apply sanctions when test results definitively
 15 11 indicate the presence of a chemical substance. The programs
 15 12 shall require participants to pay program costs and to install
 15 13 an ignition interlock device.
 15 14    A court in a county that has established a pilot program
 15 15 may order a defendant, as a condition of pretrial release,
 15 16 probation, or bond, to participate in the program. Approved
 15 17 pilot programs shall begin January 15, 2017, or upon the
 15 18 effective date of DPH rules, whichever is earlier, and shall
 15 19 be conducted for a minimum of one year. The DPH is to adopt
 15 20 rules to implement the programs, including but not limited to
 15 21 provisions relating to applications for, approval of, costs of,
 15 22 and oversight of the pilot programs and reporting requirements
 15 23 for participating counties. The DPH is directed to submit

 13  3 means alcohol, wine, spirits, and beer as defined in section
 13  4 123.3 and controlled substances as defined in section 124.101.
 13  5                           EXPLANATION
 13  6 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
 13  7 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
 13  8    Current law requires a person guilty of operating while
 13  9 intoxicated (OWI) to install an ignition interlock device in
 13 10 the person's vehicle if the person seeks a temporary restricted
 13 11 license, unless the person's alcohol concentration was less
 13 12 than .10 and no accident occurred. This bill strikes that
 13 13 exception, and also requires a person guilty of OWI to install
 13 14 an ignition interlock device in the person's vehicle upon the
 13 15 revocation of the person's driver's license rather than upon
 13 16 the person's application for a temporary restricted license.
 13 17    Under current law, an ignition interlock device is required
 13 18 to be installed in a person's vehicle for the period of time
 13 19 for which the person's temporary restricted license is issued,
 13 20 and up to one additional year after license reinstatement if
 13 21 the person has two or more OWI revocations. The bill requires
 13 22 the permanent installation of an ignition interlock device with
 13 23 two exceptions. If the ignition interlock device was installed
 13 24 as a result of the person's first OWI offense or revocation and
 13 25 a test was obtained, the device shall be uninstalled 180 days
 13 26 after the person's license was revoked, the person last failed
 13 27 a test by the ignition interlock device, or the defendant last
 13 28 failed to maintain the device as required, whichever is latest.
 13 29 If the ignition interlock device was installed as a result of
 13 30 the person's first OWI offense or revocation and a test was
 13 31 refused, the device shall be uninstalled 180 days after the
 13 32 person's license revocation period is over, the person last
 13 33 failed a test by the ignition interlock device, or the person
 13 34 last failed to maintain the device as required, whichever is
 13 35 latest.
 14  1 The bill provides an ignition interlock device shall not
 14  2 be uninstalled if the person has been convicted of a second
 14  3 or subsequent OWI violation, if the person's license has been
 14  4 revoked for a second or subsequent time, or if the person has
 14  5 been convicted of tampering with or circumventing an ignition
 14  6 interlock device.
 14  7    The bill requires the department of transportation (DOT)
 14  8 to assess a monthly ignition interlock user fee to each user
 14  9 of an ignition interlock device. All ignition interlock user
 14 10 fees will be collected by the DOT and deposited in an ignition
 14 11 interlock indigent user fund (IIIUF). The bill requires the
 14 12 DOT to use the moneys in the IIIUF to assist indigent users
 14 13 of ignition interlock devices in paying for the use of the
 14 14 devices. The amount of the monthly ignition interlock user fee
 14 15 shall be set by the DOT so that the moneys in the IIIUF are
 14 16 sufficient to assist all indigent users of ignition interlock
 14 17 devices in paying for the use of the devices.
 14 18    Under the bill, a person is indigent if the person has an
 14 19 income level at or below 125 percent of the U.S. poverty level
 14 20 and the person is unable to pay for the cost of an ignition
 14 21 interlock device. A person is also indigent if the person has
 14 22 an income level greater than 125 percent, but at or below 200
 14 23 percent, of the U.S. poverty level and paying for the ignition
 14 24 interlock device would cause the person substantial hardship.
 14 25    The bill provides for county sobriety monitoring pilot
 14 26 programs. The bill allows the department of public health
 14 27 (DPH), in collaboration with the department of corrections,
 14 28 the department of public safety, and the DOT, to approve
 14 29 applications from counties for countywide sobriety monitoring
 14 30 pilot programs. The programs are to be available 24 hours per
 14 31 day, seven days per week, in an effort to reduce the number
 14 32 of crimes related to OWI.  One application shall be approved
 14 33 for a county with a population of 200,000 people or more, one
 14 34 application shall be approved for a county with a population of
 14 35 100,000 people or more but less than 200,000 people, and one
 15  1 application shall be approved for a county with a population of
 15  2 less than 100,000 people.
 15  3    The programs shall require individuals charged with or
 15  4 convicted of OWI to abstain from all chemical substances for
 15  5 a period of time. The programs are to require testing to
 15  6 determine whether a chemical substance is present at least
 15  7 twice per day at a central location where an immediate sanction
 15  8 can be applied or, where such testing is impractical, by
 15  9 continuous transdermal or electronic monitoring. The programs
 15 10 shall also apply sanctions when test results definitively
 15 11 indicate the presence of a chemical substance. The programs
 15 12 shall require participants to pay program costs and to install
 15 13 an ignition interlock device.
 15 14    A court in a county that has established a pilot program
 15 15 may order a defendant, as a condition of pretrial release,
 15 16 probation, or bond, to participate in the program. Approved
 15 17 pilot programs shall begin January 15, 2017, or upon the
 15 18 effective date of DPH rules, whichever is earlier, and shall
 15 19 be conducted for a minimum of one year. The DPH is to adopt
 15 20 rules to implement the programs, including but not limited to
 15 21 provisions relating to applications for, approval of, costs of,
 15 22 and oversight of the pilot programs and reporting requirements
 15 23 for participating counties. The DPH is directed to submit
 15 24 a report on the results of the pilot programs and make
 15 25 recommendations to the general assembly by December 15, 2018.

 11 29 thousand people or more, one application shall be approved
 11 30 for a county with a population of one hundred thousand people
 11 31 or more but less than two hundred thousand people, and one

 12  8 immediate sanction can be applied.
 12  9    (2)  Where testing under subparagraph (1) is impractical, by
 12 10 continuous transdermal or electronic monitoring.
 12 11    c.  Apply sanctions when test results definitively, and
 12 12 without presumption, indicate the presence of chemical
 12 13 substances.
 12 14    d.  Require a person participating in the program to pay
 12 15 program costs, including costs of installation, monitoring, and

 12 22    3.  A court in a county that has established a pilot program
 12 23 pursuant to this section may order a defendant, as a condition

 12 28 is earlier, and shall be conducted for a minimum of one year.
 12 29    5.  The department of public health shall adopt rules
 12 30 pursuant to chapter 17A to implement this section including

 12 34    6.  The department of public health shall submit a report on
 12 35 the results of the pilot programs and make recommendations to
 13  1 the general assembly by December 15, 2018.
 13  2    7.  For the purposes of this section, "chemical substance"
 13  3 means alcohol, wine, spirits, and beer as defined in section
 13  4 123.3 and controlled substances as defined in section 124.101.
 13  5                           EXPLANATION
 13  6 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
 13  7 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
 13  8    Current law requires a person guilty of operating while
 13  9 intoxicated (OWI) to install an ignition interlock device in
 13 10 the person's vehicle if the person seeks a temporary restricted
 13 11 license, unless the person's alcohol concentration was less
 13 12 than .10 and no accident occurred. This bill strikes that
 13 13 exception, and also requires a person guilty of OWI to install
 13 14 an ignition interlock device in the person's vehicle upon the
 13 15 revocation of the person's driver's license rather than upon
 13 16 the person's application for a temporary restricted license.
 13 17    Under current law, an ignition interlock device is required
 13 18 to be installed in a person's vehicle for the period of time
 13 19 for which the person's temporary restricted license is issued,
 13 20 and up to one additional year after license reinstatement if
 13 21 the person has two or more OWI revocations. The bill requires
 13 22 the permanent installation of an ignition interlock device with
 13 23 two exceptions. If the ignition interlock device was installed
 13 24 as a result of the person's first OWI offense or revocation and
 13 25 a test was obtained, the device shall be uninstalled 180 days
 13 26 after the person's license was revoked, the person last failed
 13 27 a test by the ignition interlock device, or the defendant last
 13 28 failed to maintain the device as required, whichever is latest.
 13 29 If the ignition interlock device was installed as a result of
 13 30 the person's first OWI offense or revocation and a test was
 13 31 refused, the device shall be uninstalled 180 days after the
 13 32 person's license revocation period is over, the person last
 13 33 failed a test by the ignition interlock device, or the person
 13 34 last failed to maintain the device as required, whichever is
 13 35 latest.
 14  1 The bill provides an ignition interlock device shall not
 14  2 be uninstalled if the person has been convicted of a second
 14  3 or subsequent OWI violation, if the person's license has been
 14  4 revoked for a second or subsequent time, or if the person has
 14  5 been convicted of tampering with or circumventing an ignition
 14  6 interlock device.
 14  7    The bill requires the department of transportation (DOT)
 14  8 to assess a monthly ignition interlock user fee to each user
 14  9 of an ignition interlock device. All ignition interlock user
 14 10 fees will be collected by the DOT and deposited in an ignition
 14 11 interlock indigent user fund (IIIUF). The bill requires the
 14 12 DOT to use the moneys in the IIIUF to assist indigent users
 14 13 of ignition interlock devices in paying for the use of the
 14 14 devices. The amount of the monthly ignition interlock user fee
 14 15 shall be set by the DOT so that the moneys in the IIIUF are
 14 16 sufficient to assist all indigent users of ignition interlock
 14 17 devices in paying for the use of the devices.
 14 18    Under the bill, a person is indigent if the person has an
 14 19 income level at or below 125 percent of the U.S. poverty level
 14 20 and the person is unable to pay for the cost of an ignition
 14 21 interlock device. A person is also indigent if the person has
 14 22 an income level greater than 125 percent, but at or below 200
 14 23 percent, of the U.S. poverty level and paying for the ignition
 14 24 interlock device would cause the person substantial hardship.
 14 25    The bill provides for county sobriety monitoring pilot
 14 26 programs. The bill allows the department of public health
 14 27 (DPH), in collaboration with the department of corrections,
 14 28 the department of public safety, and the DOT, to approve
 14 29 applications from counties for countywide sobriety monitoring
 14 30 pilot programs. The programs are to be available 24 hours per
 14 31 day, seven days per week, in an effort to reduce the number
 14 32 of crimes related to OWI.  One application shall be approved
 14 33 for a county with a population of 200,000 people or more, one
 14 34 application shall be approved for a county with a population of
 14 35 100,000 people or more but less than 200,000 people, and one
 15  1 application shall be approved for a county with a population of
 15  2 less than 100,000 people.
 15  3    The programs shall require individuals charged with or
 15  4 convicted of OWI to abstain from all chemical substances for
 15  5 a period of time. The programs are to require testing to
 15  6 determine whether a chemical substance is present at least
 15  7 twice per day at a central location where an immediate sanction
 15  8 can be applied or, where such testing is impractical, by
 15  9 continuous transdermal or electronic monitoring. The programs
 15 10 shall also apply sanctions when test results definitively
 15 11 indicate the presence of a chemical substance. The programs
 15 12 shall require participants to pay program costs and to install
 15 13 an ignition interlock device.
 15 14    A court in a county that has established a pilot program
 15 15 may order a defendant, as a condition of pretrial release,
 15 16 probation, or bond, to participate in the program. Approved
 15 17 pilot programs shall begin January 15, 2017, or upon the
 15 18 effective date of DPH rules, whichever is earlier, and shall
 15 19 be conducted for a minimum of one year. The DPH is to adopt
 15 20 rules to implement the programs, including but not limited to
 15 21 provisions relating to applications for, approval of, costs of,
 15 22 and oversight of the pilot programs and reporting requirements
 15 23 for participating counties. The DPH is directed to submit
 15 24 a report on the results of the pilot programs and make
 15 25 recommendations to the general assembly by December 15, 2018.

 12 21 and use of the ignition interlock device.
 12 22    3.  A court in a county that has established a pilot program
 12 23 pursuant to this section may order a defendant, as a condition
 12 24 of pretrial release, probation, or bond, to participate in the
 12 25 program.
 12 26    4.  An approved pilot program shall begin on January 15,
 12 27 2017, or upon the effective date of department rules, whichever
 12 28 is earlier, and shall be conducted for a minimum of one year.
 12 29    5.  The department of public health shall adopt rules
 12 30 pursuant to chapter 17A to implement this section including
 12 31 but not limited to provisions relating to applications for,
 12 32 approval of, costs of, and oversight of the pilot programs and
 12 33 reporting requirements for participating counties.
 12 34    6.  The department of public health shall submit a report on
 12 35 the results of the pilot programs and make recommendations to
 13  1 the general assembly by December 15, 2018.
 13  2    7.  For the purposes of this section, "chemical substance"
 13  3 means alcohol, wine, spirits, and beer as defined in section
 13  4 123.3 and controlled substances as defined in section 124.101.
 13  5                           EXPLANATION
 13  6 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
 13  7 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
 13  8    Current law requires a person guilty of operating while
 13  9 intoxicated (OWI) to install an ignition interlock device in
 13 10 the person's vehicle if the person seeks a temporary restricted
 13 11 license, unless the person's alcohol concentration was less
 13 12 than .10 and no accident occurred. This bill strikes that
 13 13 exception, and also requires a person guilty of OWI to install
 13 14 an ignition interlock device in the person's vehicle upon the
 13 15 revocation of the person's driver's license rather than upon
 13 16 the person's application for a temporary restricted license.
 13 17    Under current law, an ignition interlock device is required
 13 18 to be installed in a person's vehicle for the period of time
 13 19 for which the person's temporary restricted license is issued,
 13 20 and up to one additional year after license reinstatement if
 13 21 the person has two or more OWI revocations. The bill requires
 13 22 the permanent installation of an ignition interlock device with
 13 23 two exceptions. If the ignition interlock device was installed
 13 24 as a result of the person's first OWI offense or revocation and
 13 25 a test was obtained, the device shall be uninstalled 180 days
 13 26 after the person's license was revoked, the person last failed
 13 27 a test by the ignition interlock device, or the defendant last
 13 28 failed to maintain the device as required, whichever is latest.
 13 29 If the ignition interlock device was installed as a result of
 13 30 the person's first OWI offense or revocation and a test was
 13 31 refused, the device shall be uninstalled 180 days after the
 13 32 person's license revocation period is over, the person last
 13 33 failed a test by the ignition interlock device, or the person
 13 34 last failed to maintain the device as required, whichever is
 13 35 latest.
 14  1 The bill provides an ignition interlock device shall not
 14  2 be uninstalled if the person has been convicted of a second
 14  3 or subsequent OWI violation, if the person's license has been
 14  4 revoked for a second or subsequent time, or if the person has
 14  5 been convicted of tampering with or circumventing an ignition
 14  6 interlock device.
 14  7    The bill requires the department of transportation (DOT)
 14  8 to assess a monthly ignition interlock user fee to each user
 14  9 of an ignition interlock device. All ignition interlock user
 14 10 fees will be collected by the DOT and deposited in an ignition
 14 11 interlock indigent user fund (IIIUF). The bill requires the
 14 12 DOT to use the moneys in the IIIUF to assist indigent users
 14 13 of ignition interlock devices in paying for the use of the
 14 14 devices. The amount of the monthly ignition interlock user fee
 14 15 shall be set by the DOT so that the moneys in the IIIUF are
 14 16 sufficient to assist all indigent users of ignition interlock
 14 17 devices in paying for the use of the devices.
 14 18    Under the bill, a person is indigent if the person has an
 14 19 income level at or below 125 percent of the U.S. poverty level
 14 20 and the person is unable to pay for the cost of an ignition
 14 21 interlock device. A person is also indigent if the person has
 14 22 an income level greater than 125 percent, but at or below 200
 14 23 percent, of the U.S. poverty level and paying for the ignition
 14 24 interlock device would cause the person substantial hardship.
 14 25    The bill provides for county sobriety monitoring pilot
 14 26 programs. The bill allows the department of public health
 14 27 (DPH), in collaboration with the department of corrections,
 14 28 the department of public safety, and the DOT, to approve
 14 29 applications from counties for countywide sobriety monitoring
 14 30 pilot programs. The programs are to be available 24 hours per
 14 31 day, seven days per week, in an effort to reduce the number
 14 32 of crimes related to OWI.  One application shall be approved
 14 33 for a county with a population of 200,000 people or more, one
 14 34 application shall be approved for a county with a population of
 14 35 100,000 people or more but less than 200,000 people, and one
 15  1 application shall be approved for a county with a population of
 15  2 less than 100,000 people.
 15  3    The programs shall require individuals charged with or
 15  4 convicted of OWI to abstain from all chemical substances for
 15  5 a period of time. The programs are to require testing to
 15  6 determine whether a chemical substance is present at least

 15 11 indicate the presence of a chemical substance. The programs
 15 12 shall require participants to pay program costs and to install
 15 13 an ignition interlock device.
 15 14    A court in a county that has established a pilot program
 15 15 may order a defendant, as a condition of pretrial release,
 15 16 probation, or bond, to participate in the program. Approved
 15 17 pilot programs shall begin January 15, 2017, or upon the
 15 18 effective date of DPH rules, whichever is earlier, and shall
 15 19 be conducted for a minimum of one year. The DPH is to adopt
 15 20 rules to implement the programs, including but not limited to
 15 21 provisions relating to applications for, approval of, costs of,
 15 22 and oversight of the pilot programs and reporting requirements
 15 23 for participating counties. The DPH is directed to submit

 14  3 or subsequent OWI violation, if the person's license has been
 14  4 revoked for a second or subsequent time, or if the person has
 14  5 been convicted of tampering with or circumventing an ignition
 14  6 interlock device.
 14  7    The bill requires the department of transportation (DOT)
 14  8 to assess a monthly ignition interlock user fee to each user
 14  9 of an ignition interlock device. All ignition interlock user
 14 10 fees will be collected by the DOT and deposited in an ignition
 14 11 interlock indigent user fund (IIIUF). The bill requires the
 14 12 DOT to use the moneys in the IIIUF to assist indigent users
 14 13 of ignition interlock devices in paying for the use of the
 14 14 devices. The amount of the monthly ignition interlock user fee
 14 15 shall be set by the DOT so that the moneys in the IIIUF are
 14 16 sufficient to assist all indigent users of ignition interlock
 14 17 devices in paying for the use of the devices.
 14 18    Under the bill, a person is indigent if the person has an
 14 19 income level at or below 125 percent of the U.S. poverty level
 14 20 and the person is unable to pay for the cost of an ignition
 14 21 interlock device. A person is also indigent if the person has
 14 22 an income level greater than 125 percent, but at or below 200
 14 23 percent, of the U.S. poverty level and paying for the ignition
 14 24 interlock device would cause the person substantial hardship.
 14 25    The bill provides for county sobriety monitoring pilot
 14 26 programs. The bill allows the department of public health
 14 27 (DPH), in collaboration with the department of corrections,
 14 28 the department of public safety, and the DOT, to approve
 14 29 applications from counties for countywide sobriety monitoring
 14 30 pilot programs. The programs are to be available 24 hours per
 14 31 day, seven days per week, in an effort to reduce the number
 14 32 of crimes related to OWI.  One application shall be approved
 14 33 for a county with a population of 200,000 people or more, one
 14 34 application shall be approved for a county with a population of
 14 35 100,000 people or more but less than 200,000 people, and one
 15  1 application shall be approved for a county with a population of
 15  2 less than 100,000 people.
 15  3    The programs shall require individuals charged with or
 15  4 convicted of OWI to abstain from all chemical substances for
 15  5 a period of time. The programs are to require testing to
 15  6 determine whether a chemical substance is present at least
 15  7 twice per day at a central location where an immediate sanction
 15  8 can be applied or, where such testing is impractical, by
 15  9 continuous transdermal or electronic monitoring. The programs
 15 10 shall also apply sanctions when test results definitively
 15 11 indicate the presence of a chemical substance. The programs
 15 12 shall require participants to pay program costs and to install
 15 13 an ignition interlock device.
 15 14    A court in a county that has established a pilot program
 15 15 may order a defendant, as a condition of pretrial release,
 15 16 probation, or bond, to participate in the program. Approved
 15 17 pilot programs shall begin January 15, 2017, or upon the
 15 18 effective date of DPH rules, whichever is earlier, and shall
 15 19 be conducted for a minimum of one year. The DPH is to adopt
 15 20 rules to implement the programs, including but not limited to
 15 21 provisions relating to applications for, approval of, costs of,
 15 22 and oversight of the pilot programs and reporting requirements
 15 23 for participating counties. The DPH is directed to submit
 15 24 a report on the results of the pilot programs and make
 15 25 recommendations to the general assembly by December 15, 2018.

 12  8 immediate sanction can be applied.
 12  9    (2)  Where testing under subparagraph (1) is impractical, by
 12 10 continuous transdermal or electronic monitoring.
 12 11    c.  Apply sanctions when test results definitively, and
 12 12 without presumption, indicate the presence of chemical
 12 13 substances.
 12 14    d.  Require a person participating in the program to pay
 12 15 program costs, including costs of installation, monitoring, and
 12 16 deactivation of any testing devices.
 12 17    e.  Require the person to install an ignition interlock
 12 18 device of a type approved by the commissioner of public safety
 12 19 on all vehicles owned or operated by the person, and require
 12 20 the person to pay the costs associated with the installation
 12 21 and use of the ignition interlock device.
 12 22    3.  A court in a county that has established a pilot program
 12 23 pursuant to this section may order a defendant, as a condition
 12 24 of pretrial release, probation, or bond, to participate in the
 12 25 program.
 12 26    4.  An approved pilot program shall begin on January 15,
 12 27 2017, or upon the effective date of department rules, whichever
 12 28 is earlier, and shall be conducted for a minimum of one year.
 12 29    5.  The department of public health shall adopt rules
 12 30 pursuant to chapter 17A to implement this section including
 12 31 but not limited to provisions relating to applications for,
 12 32 approval of, costs of, and oversight of the pilot programs and
 12 33 reporting requirements for participating counties.
 12 34    6.  The department of public health shall submit a report on
 12 35 the results of the pilot programs and make recommendations to
 13  1 the general assembly by December 15, 2018.
 13  2    7.  For the purposes of this section, "chemical substance"
 13  3 means alcohol, wine, spirits, and beer as defined in section
 13  4 123.3 and controlled substances as defined in section 124.101.
 13  5                           EXPLANATION
 13  6 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
 13  7 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
 13  8    Current law requires a person guilty of operating while
 13  9 intoxicated (OWI) to install an ignition interlock device in
 13 10 the person's vehicle if the person seeks a temporary restricted
 13 11 license, unless the person's alcohol concentration was less
 13 12 than .10 and no accident occurred. This bill strikes that
 13 13 exception, and also requires a person guilty of OWI to install
 13 14 an ignition interlock device in the person's vehicle upon the
 13 15 revocation of the person's driver's license rather than upon
 13 16 the person's application for a temporary restricted license.
 13 17    Under current law, an ignition interlock device is required
 13 18 to be installed in a person's vehicle for the period of time
 13 19 for which the person's temporary restricted license is issued,
 13 20 and up to one additional year after license reinstatement if
 13 21 the person has two or more OWI revocations. The bill requires
 13 22 the permanent installation of an ignition interlock device with
 13 23 two exceptions. If the ignition interlock device was installed
 13 24 as a result of the person's first OWI offense or revocation and
 13 25 a test was obtained, the device shall be uninstalled 180 days
 13 26 after the person's license was revoked, the person last failed
 13 27 a test by the ignition interlock device, or the defendant last
 13 28 failed to maintain the device as required, whichever is latest.
 13 29 If the ignition interlock device was installed as a result of
 13 30 the person's first OWI offense or revocation and a test was
 13 31 refused, the device shall be uninstalled 180 days after the
 13 32 person's license revocation period is over, the person last
 13 33 failed a test by the ignition interlock device, or the person
 13 34 last failed to maintain the device as required, whichever is
 13 35 latest.
 14  1 The bill provides an ignition interlock device shall not
 14  2 be uninstalled if the person has been convicted of a second
 14  3 or subsequent OWI violation, if the person's license has been
 14  4 revoked for a second or subsequent time, or if the person has
 14  5 been convicted of tampering with or circumventing an ignition
 14  6 interlock device.
 14  7    The bill requires the department of transportation (DOT)
 14  8 to assess a monthly ignition interlock user fee to each user
 14  9 of an ignition interlock device. All ignition interlock user
 14 10 fees will be collected by the DOT and deposited in an ignition

 14 13 of ignition interlock devices in paying for the use of the
 14 14 devices. The amount of the monthly ignition interlock user fee
 14 15 shall be set by the DOT so that the moneys in the IIIUF are
 14 16 sufficient to assist all indigent users of ignition interlock
 14 17 devices in paying for the use of the devices.

 14 19 income level at or below 125 percent of the U.S. poverty level
 14 20 and the person is unable to pay for the cost of an ignition
 14 21 interlock device. A person is also indigent if the person has
 14 22 an income level greater than 125 percent, but at or below 200
 14 23 percent, of the U.S. poverty level and paying for the ignition

 13 17    Under current law, an ignition interlock device is required
 13 18 to be installed in a person's vehicle for the period of time
 13 19 for which the person's temporary restricted license is issued,
 13 20 and up to one additional year after license reinstatement if
 13 21 the person has two or more OWI revocations. The bill requires
 13 22 the permanent installation of an ignition interlock device with
 13 23 two exceptions. If the ignition interlock device was installed
 13 24 as a result of the person's first OWI offense or revocation and
 13 25 a test was obtained, the device shall be uninstalled 180 days
 13 26 after the person's license was revoked, the person last failed
 13 27 a test by the ignition interlock device, or the defendant last
 13 28 failed to maintain the device as required, whichever is latest.
 13 29 If the ignition interlock device was installed as a result of
 13 30 the person's first OWI offense or revocation and a test was
 13 31 refused, the device shall be uninstalled 180 days after the
 13 32 person's license revocation period is over, the person last
 13 33 failed a test by the ignition interlock device, or the person
 13 34 last failed to maintain the device as required, whichever is
 13 35 latest.
 14  1 The bill provides an ignition interlock device shall not
 14  2 be uninstalled if the person has been convicted of a second
 14  3 or subsequent OWI violation, if the person's license has been
 14  4 revoked for a second or subsequent time, or if the person has
 14  5 been convicted of tampering with or circumventing an ignition
 14  6 interlock device.
 14  7    The bill requires the department of transportation (DOT)
 14  8 to assess a monthly ignition interlock user fee to each user
 14  9 of an ignition interlock device. All ignition interlock user
 14 10 fees will be collected by the DOT and deposited in an ignition
 14 11 interlock indigent user fund (IIIUF). The bill requires the
 14 12 DOT to use the moneys in the IIIUF to assist indigent users
 14 13 of ignition interlock devices in paying for the use of the
 14 14 devices. The amount of the monthly ignition interlock user fee
 14 15 shall be set by the DOT so that the moneys in the IIIUF are
 14 16 sufficient to assist all indigent users of ignition interlock
 14 17 devices in paying for the use of the devices.
 14 18    Under the bill, a person is indigent if the person has an
 14 19 income level at or below 125 percent of the U.S. poverty level
 14 20 and the person is unable to pay for the cost of an ignition
 14 21 interlock device. A person is also indigent if the person has
 14 22 an income level greater than 125 percent, but at or below 200
 14 23 percent, of the U.S. poverty level and paying for the ignition
 14 24 interlock device would cause the person substantial hardship.
 14 25    The bill provides for county sobriety monitoring pilot
 14 26 programs. The bill allows the department of public health
 14 27 (DPH), in collaboration with the department of corrections,
 14 28 the department of public safety, and the DOT, to approve
 14 29 applications from counties for countywide sobriety monitoring
 14 30 pilot programs. The programs are to be available 24 hours per
 14 31 day, seven days per week, in an effort to reduce the number
 14 32 of crimes related to OWI.  One application shall be approved
 14 33 for a county with a population of 200,000 people or more, one
 14 34 application shall be approved for a county with a population of
 14 35 100,000 people or more but less than 200,000 people, and one
 15  1 application shall be approved for a county with a population of
 15  2 less than 100,000 people.
 15  3    The programs shall require individuals charged with or
 15  4 convicted of OWI to abstain from all chemical substances for
 15  5 a period of time. The programs are to require testing to
 15  6 determine whether a chemical substance is present at least
 15  7 twice per day at a central location where an immediate sanction
 15  8 can be applied or, where such testing is impractical, by
 15  9 continuous transdermal or electronic monitoring. The programs
 15 10 shall also apply sanctions when test results definitively
 15 11 indicate the presence of a chemical substance. The programs
 15 12 shall require participants to pay program costs and to install
 15 13 an ignition interlock device.
 15 14    A court in a county that has established a pilot program
 15 15 may order a defendant, as a condition of pretrial release,
 15 16 probation, or bond, to participate in the program. Approved
 15 17 pilot programs shall begin January 15, 2017, or upon the
 15 18 effective date of DPH rules, whichever is earlier, and shall
 15 19 be conducted for a minimum of one year. The DPH is to adopt
 15 20 rules to implement the programs, including but not limited to
 15 21 provisions relating to applications for, approval of, costs of,
 15 22 and oversight of the pilot programs and reporting requirements
 15 23 for participating counties. The DPH is directed to submit
 15 24 a report on the results of the pilot programs and make
 15 25 recommendations to the general assembly by December 15, 2018.

 13  6 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
 13  7 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
 13  8    Current law requires a person guilty of operating while
 13  9 intoxicated (OWI) to install an ignition interlock device in
 13 10 the person's vehicle if the person seeks a temporary restricted
 13 11 license, unless the person's alcohol concentration was less
 13 12 than .10 and no accident occurred. This bill strikes that
 13 13 exception, and also requires a person guilty of OWI to install
 13 14 an ignition interlock device in the person's vehicle upon the
 13 15 revocation of the person's driver's license rather than upon
 13 16 the person's application for a temporary restricted license.

 13 28 failed to maintain the device as required, whichever is latest.
 13 29 If the ignition interlock device was installed as a result of
 13 30 the person's first OWI offense or revocation and a test was
 13 31 refused, the device shall be uninstalled 180 days after the
 13 32 person's license revocation period is over, the person last
 13 33 failed a test by the ignition interlock device, or the person
 13 34 last failed to maintain the device as required, whichever is

 13  5                           EXPLANATION
 13  6 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
 13  7 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
 13  8    Current law requires a person guilty of operating while
 13  9 intoxicated (OWI) to install an ignition interlock device in
 13 10 the person's vehicle if the person seeks a temporary restricted
 13 11 license, unless the person's alcohol concentration was less
 13 12 than .10 and no accident occurred. This bill strikes that
 13 13 exception, and also requires a person guilty of OWI to install
 13 14 an ignition interlock device in the person's vehicle upon the
 13 15 revocation of the person's driver's license rather than upon
 13 16 the person's application for a temporary restricted license.
 13 17    Under current law, an ignition interlock device is required
 13 18 to be installed in a person's vehicle for the period of time
 13 19 for which the person's temporary restricted license is issued,
 13 20 and up to one additional year after license reinstatement if
 13 21 the person has two or more OWI revocations. The bill requires
 13 22 the permanent installation of an ignition interlock device with
 13 23 two exceptions. If the ignition interlock device was installed
 13 24 as a result of the person's first OWI offense or revocation and
 13 25 a test was obtained, the device shall be uninstalled 180 days
 13 26 after the person's license was revoked, the person last failed
 13 27 a test by the ignition interlock device, or the defendant last
 13 28 failed to maintain the device as required, whichever is latest.
 13 29 If the ignition interlock device was installed as a result of
 13 30 the person's first OWI offense or revocation and a test was
 13 31 refused, the device shall be uninstalled 180 days after the
 13 32 person's license revocation period is over, the person last
 13 33 failed a test by the ignition interlock device, or the person
 13 34 last failed to maintain the device as required, whichever is
 13 35 latest.
 14  1 The bill provides an ignition interlock device shall not
 14  2 be uninstalled if the person has been convicted of a second
 14  3 or subsequent OWI violation, if the person's license has been
 14  4 revoked for a second or subsequent time, or if the person has
 14  5 been convicted of tampering with or circumventing an ignition
 14  6 interlock device.
 14  7    The bill requires the department of transportation (DOT)
 14  8 to assess a monthly ignition interlock user fee to each user
 14  9 of an ignition interlock device. All ignition interlock user
 14 10 fees will be collected by the DOT and deposited in an ignition
 14 11 interlock indigent user fund (IIIUF). The bill requires the
 14 12 DOT to use the moneys in the IIIUF to assist indigent users
 14 13 of ignition interlock devices in paying for the use of the
 14 14 devices. The amount of the monthly ignition interlock user fee
 14 15 shall be set by the DOT so that the moneys in the IIIUF are
 14 16 sufficient to assist all indigent users of ignition interlock
 14 17 devices in paying for the use of the devices.
 14 18    Under the bill, a person is indigent if the person has an
 14 19 income level at or below 125 percent of the U.S. poverty level
 14 20 and the person is unable to pay for the cost of an ignition
 14 21 interlock device. A person is also indigent if the person has
 14 22 an income level greater than 125 percent, but at or below 200
 14 23 percent, of the U.S. poverty level and paying for the ignition
 14 24 interlock device would cause the person substantial hardship.
 14 25    The bill provides for county sobriety monitoring pilot
 14 26 programs. The bill allows the department of public health
 14 27 (DPH), in collaboration with the department of corrections,
 14 28 the department of public safety, and the DOT, to approve
 14 29 applications from counties for countywide sobriety monitoring
 14 30 pilot programs. The programs are to be available 24 hours per
 14 31 day, seven days per week, in an effort to reduce the number
 14 32 of crimes related to OWI.  One application shall be approved
 14 33 for a county with a population of 200,000 people or more, one
 14 34 application shall be approved for a county with a population of
 14 35 100,000 people or more but less than 200,000 people, and one
 15  1 application shall be approved for a county with a population of
 15  2 less than 100,000 people.
 15  3    The programs shall require individuals charged with or
 15  4 convicted of OWI to abstain from all chemical substances for
 15  5 a period of time. The programs are to require testing to
 15  6 determine whether a chemical substance is present at least
 15  7 twice per day at a central location where an immediate sanction
 15  8 can be applied or, where such testing is impractical, by
 15  9 continuous transdermal or electronic monitoring. The programs
 15 10 shall also apply sanctions when test results definitively
 15 11 indicate the presence of a chemical substance. The programs
 15 12 shall require participants to pay program costs and to install
 15 13 an ignition interlock device.
 15 14    A court in a county that has established a pilot program
 15 15 may order a defendant, as a condition of pretrial release,
 15 16 probation, or bond, to participate in the program. Approved
 15 17 pilot programs shall begin January 15, 2017, or upon the
 15 18 effective date of DPH rules, whichever is earlier, and shall
 15 19 be conducted for a minimum of one year. The DPH is to adopt
 15 20 rules to implement the programs, including but not limited to
 15 21 provisions relating to applications for, approval of, costs of,
 15 22 and oversight of the pilot programs and reporting requirements
 15 23 for participating counties. The DPH is directed to submit
 15 24 a report on the results of the pilot programs and make
 15 25 recommendations to the general assembly by December 15, 2018.

 11 34    2.  A sobriety monitoring pilot program shall do all of the
 11 35 following:
 12  1    a.  Require a person who has been charged with, pled guilty
 12  2 to, or been convicted of a violation of section 321J.2 to
 12  3 abstain from all chemical substances for a period of time.
 12  4    b.  Require the person to be subject to testing to determine
 12  5 whether a chemical substance is present in the person's body
 12  6 in the following manner:
 12  7    (1)  At least twice per day at a central location where an
 12  8 immediate sanction can be applied.
 12  9    (2)  Where testing under subparagraph (1) is impractical, by
 12 10 continuous transdermal or electronic monitoring.
 12 11    c.  Apply sanctions when test results definitively, and
 12 12 without presumption, indicate the presence of chemical
 12 13 substances.
 12 14    d.  Require a person participating in the program to pay
 12 15 program costs, including costs of installation, monitoring, and
 12 16 deactivation of any testing devices.
 12 17    e.  Require the person to install an ignition interlock
 12 18 device of a type approved by the commissioner of public safety
 12 19 on all vehicles owned or operated by the person, and require
 12 20 the person to pay the costs associated with the installation
 12 21 and use of the ignition interlock device.
 12 22    3.  A court in a county that has established a pilot program
 12 23 pursuant to this section may order a defendant, as a condition
 12 24 of pretrial release, probation, or bond, to participate in the
 12 25 program.
 12 26    4.  An approved pilot program shall begin on January 15,
 12 27 2017, or upon the effective date of department rules, whichever
 12 28 is earlier, and shall be conducted for a minimum of one year.
 12 29    5.  The department of public health shall adopt rules
 12 30 pursuant to chapter 17A to implement this section including
 12 31 but not limited to provisions relating to applications for,
 12 32 approval of, costs of, and oversight of the pilot programs and
 12 33 reporting requirements for participating counties.
 12 34    6.  The department of public health shall submit a report on
 12 35 the results of the pilot programs and make recommendations to
 13  1 the general assembly by December 15, 2018.
 13  2    7.  For the purposes of this section, "chemical substance"
 13  3 means alcohol, wine, spirits, and beer as defined in section
 13  4 123.3 and controlled substances as defined in section 124.101.

 13  1 the general assembly by December 15, 2018.
 13  2    7.  For the purposes of this section, "chemical substance"
 13  3 means alcohol, wine, spirits, and beer as defined in section
 13  4 123.3 and controlled substances as defined in section 124.101.
 13  5                           EXPLANATION
 13  6 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
 13  7 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
 13  8    Current law requires a person guilty of operating while
 13  9 intoxicated (OWI) to install an ignition interlock device in
 13 10 the person's vehicle if the person seeks a temporary restricted
 13 11 license, unless the person's alcohol concentration was less
 13 12 than .10 and no accident occurred. This bill strikes that
 13 13 exception, and also requires a person guilty of OWI to install
 13 14 an ignition interlock device in the person's vehicle upon the
 13 15 revocation of the person's driver's license rather than upon
 13 16 the person's application for a temporary restricted license.
 13 17    Under current law, an ignition interlock device is required
 13 18 to be installed in a person's vehicle for the period of time
 13 19 for which the person's temporary restricted license is issued,
 13 20 and up to one additional year after license reinstatement if
 13 21 the person has two or more OWI revocations. The bill requires
 13 22 the permanent installation of an ignition interlock device with
 13 23 two exceptions. If the ignition interlock device was installed
 13 24 as a result of the person's first OWI offense or revocation and
 13 25 a test was obtained, the device shall be uninstalled 180 days
 13 26 after the person's license was revoked, the person last failed
 13 27 a test by the ignition interlock device, or the defendant last
 13 28 failed to maintain the device as required, whichever is latest.
 13 29 If the ignition interlock device was installed as a result of
 13 30 the person's first OWI offense or revocation and a test was
 13 31 refused, the device shall be uninstalled 180 days after the
 13 32 person's license revocation period is over, the person last
 13 33 failed a test by the ignition interlock device, or the person
 13 34 last failed to maintain the device as required, whichever is
 13 35 latest.
 14  1 The bill provides an ignition interlock device shall not
 14  2 be uninstalled if the person has been convicted of a second
 14  3 or subsequent OWI violation, if the person's license has been
 14  4 revoked for a second or subsequent time, or if the person has
 14  5 been convicted of tampering with or circumventing an ignition
 14  6 interlock device.
 14  7    The bill requires the department of transportation (DOT)
 14  8 to assess a monthly ignition interlock user fee to each user
 14  9 of an ignition interlock device. All ignition interlock user
 14 10 fees will be collected by the DOT and deposited in an ignition
 14 11 interlock indigent user fund (IIIUF). The bill requires the
 14 12 DOT to use the moneys in the IIIUF to assist indigent users
 14 13 of ignition interlock devices in paying for the use of the
 14 14 devices. The amount of the monthly ignition interlock user fee
 14 15 shall be set by the DOT so that the moneys in the IIIUF are
 14 16 sufficient to assist all indigent users of ignition interlock
 14 17 devices in paying for the use of the devices.
 14 18    Under the bill, a person is indigent if the person has an
 14 19 income level at or below 125 percent of the U.S. poverty level
 14 20 and the person is unable to pay for the cost of an ignition
 14 21 interlock device. A person is also indigent if the person has
 14 22 an income level greater than 125 percent, but at or below 200
 14 23 percent, of the U.S. poverty level and paying for the ignition
 14 24 interlock device would cause the person substantial hardship.
 14 25    The bill provides for county sobriety monitoring pilot
 14 26 programs. The bill allows the department of public health
 14 27 (DPH), in collaboration with the department of corrections,
 14 28 the department of public safety, and the DOT, to approve
 14 29 applications from counties for countywide sobriety monitoring
 14 30 pilot programs. The programs are to be available 24 hours per
 14 31 day, seven days per week, in an effort to reduce the number
 14 32 of crimes related to OWI.  One application shall be approved
 14 33 for a county with a population of 200,000 people or more, one
 14 34 application shall be approved for a county with a population of
 14 35 100,000 people or more but less than 200,000 people, and one
 15  1 application shall be approved for a county with a population of
 15  2 less than 100,000 people.
 15  3    The programs shall require individuals charged with or
 15  4 convicted of OWI to abstain from all chemical substances for
 15  5 a period of time. The programs are to require testing to
 15  6 determine whether a chemical substance is present at least
 15  7 twice per day at a central location where an immediate sanction
 15  8 can be applied or, where such testing is impractical, by
 15  9 continuous transdermal or electronic monitoring. The programs
 15 10 shall also apply sanctions when test results definitively
 15 11 indicate the presence of a chemical substance. The programs
 15 12 shall require participants to pay program costs and to install
 15 13 an ignition interlock device.
 15 14    A court in a county that has established a pilot program
 15 15 may order a defendant, as a condition of pretrial release,
 15 16 probation, or bond, to participate in the program. Approved
 15 17 pilot programs shall begin January 15, 2017, or upon the
 15 18 effective date of DPH rules, whichever is earlier, and shall
 15 19 be conducted for a minimum of one year. The DPH is to adopt
 15 20 rules to implement the programs, including but not limited to
 15 21 provisions relating to applications for, approval of, costs of,
 15 22 and oversight of the pilot programs and reporting requirements
 15 23 for participating counties. The DPH is directed to submit
 15 24 a report on the results of the pilot programs and make
 15 25 recommendations to the general assembly by December 15, 2018.

 13  4 123.3 and controlled substances as defined in section 124.101.
 13  5                           EXPLANATION
 13  6 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
 13  7 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
 13  8    Current law requires a person guilty of operating while
 13  9 intoxicated (OWI) to install an ignition interlock device in
 13 10 the person's vehicle if the person seeks a temporary restricted
 13 11 license, unless the person's alcohol concentration was less
 13 12 than .10 and no accident occurred. This bill strikes that
 13 13 exception, and also requires a person guilty of OWI to install
 13 14 an ignition interlock device in the person's vehicle upon the
 13 15 revocation of the person's driver's license rather than upon
 13 16 the person's application for a temporary restricted license.
 13 17    Under current law, an ignition interlock device is required
 13 18 to be installed in a person's vehicle for the period of time
 13 19 for which the person's temporary restricted license is issued,
 13 20 and up to one additional year after license reinstatement if
 13 21 the person has two or more OWI revocations. The bill requires
 13 22 the permanent installation of an ignition interlock device with
 13 23 two exceptions. If the ignition interlock device was installed
 13 24 as a result of the person's first OWI offense or revocation and
 13 25 a test was obtained, the device shall be uninstalled 180 days
 13 26 after the person's license was revoked, the person last failed
 13 27 a test by the ignition interlock device, or the defendant last
 13 28 failed to maintain the device as required, whichever is latest.
 13 29 If the ignition interlock device was installed as a result of
 13 30 the person's first OWI offense or revocation and a test was
 13 31 refused, the device shall be uninstalled 180 days after the
 13 32 person's license revocation period is over, the person last
 13 33 failed a test by the ignition interlock device, or the person
 13 34 last failed to maintain the device as required, whichever is
 13 35 latest.
 14  1 The bill provides an ignition interlock device shall not
 14  2 be uninstalled if the person has been convicted of a second
 14  3 or subsequent OWI violation, if the person's license has been
 14  4 revoked for a second or subsequent time, or if the person has
 14  5 been convicted of tampering with or circumventing an ignition
 14  6 interlock device.
 14  7    The bill requires the department of transportation (DOT)
 14  8 to assess a monthly ignition interlock user fee to each user
 14  9 of an ignition interlock device. All ignition interlock user
 14 10 fees will be collected by the DOT and deposited in an ignition
 14 11 interlock indigent user fund (IIIUF). The bill requires the
 14 12 DOT to use the moneys in the IIIUF to assist indigent users
 14 13 of ignition interlock devices in paying for the use of the
 14 14 devices. The amount of the monthly ignition interlock user fee
 14 15 shall be set by the DOT so that the moneys in the IIIUF are
 14 16 sufficient to assist all indigent users of ignition interlock
 14 17 devices in paying for the use of the devices.
 14 18    Under the bill, a person is indigent if the person has an
 14 19 income level at or below 125 percent of the U.S. poverty level
 14 20 and the person is unable to pay for the cost of an ignition
 14 21 interlock device. A person is also indigent if the person has
 14 22 an income level greater than 125 percent, but at or below 200
 14 23 percent, of the U.S. poverty level and paying for the ignition
 14 24 interlock device would cause the person substantial hardship.
 14 25    The bill provides for county sobriety monitoring pilot
 14 26 programs. The bill allows the department of public health
 14 27 (DPH), in collaboration with the department of corrections,
 14 28 the department of public safety, and the DOT, to approve
 14 29 applications from counties for countywide sobriety monitoring
 14 30 pilot programs. The programs are to be available 24 hours per
 14 31 day, seven days per week, in an effort to reduce the number
 14 32 of crimes related to OWI.  One application shall be approved
 14 33 for a county with a population of 200,000 people or more, one
 14 34 application shall be approved for a county with a population of
 14 35 100,000 people or more but less than 200,000 people, and one
 15  1 application shall be approved for a county with a population of
 15  2 less than 100,000 people.
 15  3    The programs shall require individuals charged with or
 15  4 convicted of OWI to abstain from all chemical substances for
 15  5 a period of time. The programs are to require testing to
 15  6 determine whether a chemical substance is present at least
 15  7 twice per day at a central location where an immediate sanction
 15  8 can be applied or, where such testing is impractical, by
 15  9 continuous transdermal or electronic monitoring. The programs
 15 10 shall also apply sanctions when test results definitively
 15 11 indicate the presence of a chemical substance. The programs
 15 12 shall require participants to pay program costs and to install
 15 13 an ignition interlock device.
 15 14    A court in a county that has established a pilot program
 15 15 may order a defendant, as a condition of pretrial release,
 15 16 probation, or bond, to participate in the program. Approved
 15 17 pilot programs shall begin January 15, 2017, or upon the
 15 18 effective date of DPH rules, whichever is earlier, and shall
 15 19 be conducted for a minimum of one year. The DPH is to adopt
 15 20 rules to implement the programs, including but not limited to
 15 21 provisions relating to applications for, approval of, costs of,
 15 22 and oversight of the pilot programs and reporting requirements
 15 23 for participating counties. The DPH is directed to submit
 15 24 a report on the results of the pilot programs and make
 15 25 recommendations to the general assembly by December 15, 2018.

 12  4    b.  Require the person to be subject to testing to determine
 12  5 whether a chemical substance is present in the person's body
 12  6 in the following manner:
 12  7    (1)  At least twice per day at a central location where an
 12  8 immediate sanction can be applied.
 12  9    (2)  Where testing under subparagraph (1) is impractical, by

 12 11    c.  Apply sanctions when test results definitively, and
 12 12 without presumption, indicate the presence of chemical
 12 13 substances.
 12 14    d.  Require a person participating in the program to pay
 12 15 program costs, including costs of installation, monitoring, and
 12 16 deactivation of any testing devices.
 12 17    e.  Require the person to install an ignition interlock
 12 18 device of a type approved by the commissioner of public safety
 12 19 on all vehicles owned or operated by the person, and require
 12 20 the person to pay the costs associated with the installation
 12 21 and use of the ignition interlock device.

 12 25 program.
 12 26    4.  An approved pilot program shall begin on January 15,
 12 27 2017, or upon the effective date of department rules, whichever
 12 28 is earlier, and shall be conducted for a minimum of one year.
 12 29    5.  The department of public health shall adopt rules
 12 30 pursuant to chapter 17A to implement this section including
 12 31 but not limited to provisions relating to applications for,
 12 32 approval of, costs of, and oversight of the pilot programs and
 12 33 reporting requirements for participating counties.
 12 34    6.  The department of public health shall submit a report on
 12 35 the results of the pilot programs and make recommendations to
 13  1 the general assembly by December 15, 2018.

 13 17    Under current law, an ignition interlock device is required
 13 18 to be installed in a person's vehicle for the period of time
 13 19 for which the person's temporary restricted license is issued,
 13 20 and up to one additional year after license reinstatement if
 13 21 the person has two or more OWI revocations. The bill requires
 13 22 the permanent installation of an ignition interlock device with
 13 23 two exceptions. If the ignition interlock device was installed
 13 24 as a result of the person's first OWI offense or revocation and
 13 25 a test was obtained, the device shall be uninstalled 180 days
 13 26 after the person's license was revoked, the person last failed
 13 27 a test by the ignition interlock device, or the defendant last
 13 28 failed to maintain the device as required, whichever is latest.
 13 29 If the ignition interlock device was installed as a result of
 13 30 the person's first OWI offense or revocation and a test was
 13 31 refused, the device shall be uninstalled 180 days after the
 13 32 person's license revocation period is over, the person last
 13 33 failed a test by the ignition interlock device, or the person
 13 34 last failed to maintain the device as required, whichever is
 13 35 latest.
 14  1 The bill provides an ignition interlock device shall not
 14  2 be uninstalled if the person has been convicted of a second
 14  3 or subsequent OWI violation, if the person's license has been
 14  4 revoked for a second or subsequent time, or if the person has
 14  5 been convicted of tampering with or circumventing an ignition
 14  6 interlock device.
 14  7    The bill requires the department of transportation (DOT)
 14  8 to assess a monthly ignition interlock user fee to each user
 14  9 of an ignition interlock device. All ignition interlock user
 14 10 fees will be collected by the DOT and deposited in an ignition
 14 11 interlock indigent user fund (IIIUF). The bill requires the
 14 12 DOT to use the moneys in the IIIUF to assist indigent users
 14 13 of ignition interlock devices in paying for the use of the
 14 14 devices. The amount of the monthly ignition interlock user fee
 14 15 shall be set by the DOT so that the moneys in the IIIUF are
 14 16 sufficient to assist all indigent users of ignition interlock
 14 17 devices in paying for the use of the devices.
 14 18    Under the bill, a person is indigent if the person has an
 14 19 income level at or below 125 percent of the U.S. poverty level
 14 20 and the person is unable to pay for the cost of an ignition
 14 21 interlock device. A person is also indigent if the person has
 14 22 an income level greater than 125 percent, but at or below 200
 14 23 percent, of the U.S. poverty level and paying for the ignition
 14 24 interlock device would cause the person substantial hardship.
 14 25    The bill provides for county sobriety monitoring pilot
 14 26 programs. The bill allows the department of public health
 14 27 (DPH), in collaboration with the department of corrections,
 14 28 the department of public safety, and the DOT, to approve
 14 29 applications from counties for countywide sobriety monitoring
 14 30 pilot programs. The programs are to be available 24 hours per
 14 31 day, seven days per week, in an effort to reduce the number
 14 32 of crimes related to OWI.  One application shall be approved
 14 33 for a county with a population of 200,000 people or more, one
 14 34 application shall be approved for a county with a population of
 14 35 100,000 people or more but less than 200,000 people, and one
 15  1 application shall be approved for a county with a population of
 15  2 less than 100,000 people.
 15  3    The programs shall require individuals charged with or
 15  4 convicted of OWI to abstain from all chemical substances for
 15  5 a period of time. The programs are to require testing to
 15  6 determine whether a chemical substance is present at least
 15  7 twice per day at a central location where an immediate sanction
 15  8 can be applied or, where such testing is impractical, by
 15  9 continuous transdermal or electronic monitoring. The programs
 15 10 shall also apply sanctions when test results definitively
 15 11 indicate the presence of a chemical substance. The programs
 15 12 shall require participants to pay program costs and to install
 15 13 an ignition interlock device.
 15 14    A court in a county that has established a pilot program
 15 15 may order a defendant, as a condition of pretrial release,
 15 16 probation, or bond, to participate in the program. Approved
 15 17 pilot programs shall begin January 15, 2017, or upon the
 15 18 effective date of DPH rules, whichever is earlier, and shall
 15 19 be conducted for a minimum of one year. The DPH is to adopt
 15 20 rules to implement the programs, including but not limited to
 15 21 provisions relating to applications for, approval of, costs of,
 15 22 and oversight of the pilot programs and reporting requirements
 15 23 for participating counties. The DPH is directed to submit
 15 24 a report on the results of the pilot programs and make
 15 25 recommendations to the general assembly by December 15, 2018.

 12 35 the results of the pilot programs and make recommendations to
 13  1 the general assembly by December 15, 2018.
 13  2    7.  For the purposes of this section, "chemical substance"
 13  3 means alcohol, wine, spirits, and beer as defined in section
 13  4 123.3 and controlled substances as defined in section 124.101.
 13  5                           EXPLANATION
 13  6 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
 13  7 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
 13  8    Current law requires a person guilty of operating while
 13  9 intoxicated (OWI) to install an ignition interlock device in
 13 10 the person's vehicle if the person seeks a temporary restricted
 13 11 license, unless the person's alcohol concentration was less
 13 12 than .10 and no accident occurred. This bill strikes that
 13 13 exception, and also requires a person guilty of OWI to install
 13 14 an ignition interlock device in the person's vehicle upon the
 13 15 revocation of the person's driver's license rather than upon
 13 16 the person's application for a temporary restricted license.
 13 17    Under current law, an ignition interlock device is required
 13 18 to be installed in a person's vehicle for the period of time
 13 19 for which the person's temporary restricted license is issued,
 13 20 and up to one additional year after license reinstatement if
 13 21 the person has two or more OWI revocations. The bill requires
 13 22 the permanent installation of an ignition interlock device with
 13 23 two exceptions. If the ignition interlock device was installed
 13 24 as a result of the person's first OWI offense or revocation and
 13 25 a test was obtained, the device shall be uninstalled 180 days
 13 26 after the person's license was revoked, the person last failed
 13 27 a test by the ignition interlock device, or the defendant last
 13 28 failed to maintain the device as required, whichever is latest.
 13 29 If the ignition interlock device was installed as a result of
 13 30 the person's first OWI offense or revocation and a test was
 13 31 refused, the device shall be uninstalled 180 days after the
 13 32 person's license revocation period is over, the person last
 13 33 failed a test by the ignition interlock device, or the person
 13 34 last failed to maintain the device as required, whichever is
 13 35 latest.
 14  1 The bill provides an ignition interlock device shall not
 14  2 be uninstalled if the person has been convicted of a second
 14  3 or subsequent OWI violation, if the person's license has been
 14  4 revoked for a second or subsequent time, or if the person has
 14  5 been convicted of tampering with or circumventing an ignition
 14  6 interlock device.
 14  7    The bill requires the department of transportation (DOT)
 14  8 to assess a monthly ignition interlock user fee to each user
 14  9 of an ignition interlock device. All ignition interlock user
 14 10 fees will be collected by the DOT and deposited in an ignition
 14 11 interlock indigent user fund (IIIUF). The bill requires the
 14 12 DOT to use the moneys in the IIIUF to assist indigent users
 14 13 of ignition interlock devices in paying for the use of the
 14 14 devices. The amount of the monthly ignition interlock user fee
 14 15 shall be set by the DOT so that the moneys in the IIIUF are
 14 16 sufficient to assist all indigent users of ignition interlock
 14 17 devices in paying for the use of the devices.
 14 18    Under the bill, a person is indigent if the person has an
 14 19 income level at or below 125 percent of the U.S. poverty level
 14 20 and the person is unable to pay for the cost of an ignition
 14 21 interlock device. A person is also indigent if the person has
 14 22 an income level greater than 125 percent, but at or below 200
 14 23 percent, of the U.S. poverty level and paying for the ignition
 14 24 interlock device would cause the person substantial hardship.

 15  1 application shall be approved for a county with a population of
 15  2 less than 100,000 people.
 15  3    The programs shall require individuals charged with or
 15  4 convicted of OWI to abstain from all chemical substances for

 13 24 as a result of the person's first OWI offense or revocation and
 13 25 a test was obtained, the device shall be uninstalled 180 days
 13 26 after the person's license was revoked, the person last failed

 13 33 failed a test by the ignition interlock device, or the person
 13 34 last failed to maintain the device as required, whichever is
 13 35 latest.
 14  1 The bill provides an ignition interlock device shall not
 14  2 be uninstalled if the person has been convicted of a second
 14  3 or subsequent OWI violation, if the person's license has been
 14  4 revoked for a second or subsequent time, or if the person has
 14  5 been convicted of tampering with or circumventing an ignition
 14  6 interlock device.
 14  7    The bill requires the department of transportation (DOT)
 14  8 to assess a monthly ignition interlock user fee to each user
 14  9 of an ignition interlock device. All ignition interlock user
 14 10 fees will be collected by the DOT and deposited in an ignition
 14 11 interlock indigent user fund (IIIUF). The bill requires the
 14 12 DOT to use the moneys in the IIIUF to assist indigent users
 14 13 of ignition interlock devices in paying for the use of the
 14 14 devices. The amount of the monthly ignition interlock user fee
 14 15 shall be set by the DOT so that the moneys in the IIIUF are
 14 16 sufficient to assist all indigent users of ignition interlock
 14 17 devices in paying for the use of the devices.
 14 18    Under the bill, a person is indigent if the person has an
 14 19 income level at or below 125 percent of the U.S. poverty level
 14 20 and the person is unable to pay for the cost of an ignition
 14 21 interlock device. A person is also indigent if the person has
 14 22 an income level greater than 125 percent, but at or below 200
 14 23 percent, of the U.S. poverty level and paying for the ignition
 14 24 interlock device would cause the person substantial hardship.
 14 25    The bill provides for county sobriety monitoring pilot
 14 26 programs. The bill allows the department of public health
 14 27 (DPH), in collaboration with the department of corrections,
 14 28 the department of public safety, and the DOT, to approve
 14 29 applications from counties for countywide sobriety monitoring
 14 30 pilot programs. The programs are to be available 24 hours per
 14 31 day, seven days per week, in an effort to reduce the number
 14 32 of crimes related to OWI.  One application shall be approved
 14 33 for a county with a population of 200,000 people or more, one
 14 34 application shall be approved for a county with a population of
 14 35 100,000 people or more but less than 200,000 people, and one
 15  1 application shall be approved for a county with a population of
 15  2 less than 100,000 people.
 15  3    The programs shall require individuals charged with or
 15  4 convicted of OWI to abstain from all chemical substances for
 15  5 a period of time. The programs are to require testing to
 15  6 determine whether a chemical substance is present at least
 15  7 twice per day at a central location where an immediate sanction
 15  8 can be applied or, where such testing is impractical, by
 15  9 continuous transdermal or electronic monitoring. The programs
 15 10 shall also apply sanctions when test results definitively
 15 11 indicate the presence of a chemical substance. The programs
 15 12 shall require participants to pay program costs and to install
 15 13 an ignition interlock device.
 15 14    A court in a county that has established a pilot program
 15 15 may order a defendant, as a condition of pretrial release,
 15 16 probation, or bond, to participate in the program. Approved
 15 17 pilot programs shall begin January 15, 2017, or upon the
 15 18 effective date of DPH rules, whichever is earlier, and shall
 15 19 be conducted for a minimum of one year. The DPH is to adopt
 15 20 rules to implement the programs, including but not limited to
 15 21 provisions relating to applications for, approval of, costs of,
 15 22 and oversight of the pilot programs and reporting requirements
 15 23 for participating counties. The DPH is directed to submit
 15 24 a report on the results of the pilot programs and make
 15 25 recommendations to the general assembly by December 15, 2018.

 13  4 123.3 and controlled substances as defined in section 124.101.
 13  5                           EXPLANATION
 13  6 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
 13  7 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
 13  8    Current law requires a person guilty of operating while
 13  9 intoxicated (OWI) to install an ignition interlock device in
 13 10 the person's vehicle if the person seeks a temporary restricted
 13 11 license, unless the person's alcohol concentration was less
 13 12 than .10 and no accident occurred. This bill strikes that
 13 13 exception, and also requires a person guilty of OWI to install
 13 14 an ignition interlock device in the person's vehicle upon the
 13 15 revocation of the person's driver's license rather than upon
 13 16 the person's application for a temporary restricted license.
 13 17    Under current law, an ignition interlock device is required
 13 18 to be installed in a person's vehicle for the period of time
 13 19 for which the person's temporary restricted license is issued,
 13 20 and up to one additional year after license reinstatement if
 13 21 the person has two or more OWI revocations. The bill requires
 13 22 the permanent installation of an ignition interlock device with
 13 23 two exceptions. If the ignition interlock device was installed
 13 24 as a result of the person's first OWI offense or revocation and
 13 25 a test was obtained, the device shall be uninstalled 180 days
 13 26 after the person's license was revoked, the person last failed
 13 27 a test by the ignition interlock device, or the defendant last
 13 28 failed to maintain the device as required, whichever is latest.
 13 29 If the ignition interlock device was installed as a result of
 13 30 the person's first OWI offense or revocation and a test was
 13 31 refused, the device shall be uninstalled 180 days after the
 13 32 person's license revocation period is over, the person last
 13 33 failed a test by the ignition interlock device, or the person
 13 34 last failed to maintain the device as required, whichever is
 13 35 latest.
 14  1 The bill provides an ignition interlock device shall not
 14  2 be uninstalled if the person has been convicted of a second
 14  3 or subsequent OWI violation, if the person's license has been
 14  4 revoked for a second or subsequent time, or if the person has
 14  5 been convicted of tampering with or circumventing an ignition
 14  6 interlock device.
 14  7    The bill requires the department of transportation (DOT)
 14  8 to assess a monthly ignition interlock user fee to each user
 14  9 of an ignition interlock device. All ignition interlock user
 14 10 fees will be collected by the DOT and deposited in an ignition
 14 11 interlock indigent user fund (IIIUF). The bill requires the
 14 12 DOT to use the moneys in the IIIUF to assist indigent users
 14 13 of ignition interlock devices in paying for the use of the
 14 14 devices. The amount of the monthly ignition interlock user fee
 14 15 shall be set by the DOT so that the moneys in the IIIUF are
 14 16 sufficient to assist all indigent users of ignition interlock
 14 17 devices in paying for the use of the devices.
 14 18    Under the bill, a person is indigent if the person has an
 14 19 income level at or below 125 percent of the U.S. poverty level
 14 20 and the person is unable to pay for the cost of an ignition
 14 21 interlock device. A person is also indigent if the person has
 14 22 an income level greater than 125 percent, but at or below 200
 14 23 percent, of the U.S. poverty level and paying for the ignition
 14 24 interlock device would cause the person substantial hardship.

 13  4 123.3 and controlled substances as defined in section 124.101.
 13  5                           EXPLANATION
 13  6 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
 13  7 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
 13  8    Current law requires a person guilty of operating while
 13  9 intoxicated (OWI) to install an ignition interlock device in
 13 10 the person's vehicle if the person seeks a temporary restricted
 13 11 license, unless the person's alcohol concentration was less
 13 12 than .10 and no accident occurred. This bill strikes that
 13 13 exception, and also requires a person guilty of OWI to install
 13 14 an ignition interlock device in the person's vehicle upon the
 13 15 revocation of the person's driver's license rather than upon
 13 16 the person's application for a temporary restricted license.
 13 17    Under current law, an ignition interlock device is required
 13 18 to be installed in a person's vehicle for the period of time
 13 19 for which the person's temporary restricted license is issued,
 13 20 and up to one additional year after license reinstatement if
 13 21 the person has two or more OWI revocations. The bill requires
 13 22 the permanent installation of an ignition interlock device with
 13 23 two exceptions. If the ignition interlock device was installed
 13 24 as a result of the person's first OWI offense or revocation and
 13 25 a test was obtained, the device shall be uninstalled 180 days
 13 26 after the person's license was revoked, the person last failed
 13 27 a test by the ignition interlock device, or the defendant last
 13 28 failed to maintain the device as required, whichever is latest.
 13 29 If the ignition interlock device was installed as a result of
 13 30 the person's first OWI offense or revocation and a test was
 13 31 refused, the device shall be uninstalled 180 days after the
 13 32 person's license revocation period is over, the person last
 13 33 failed a test by the ignition interlock device, or the person
 13 34 last failed to maintain the device as required, whichever is
 13 35 latest.
 14  1 The bill provides an ignition interlock device shall not
 14  2 be uninstalled if the person has been convicted of a second
 14  3 or subsequent OWI violation, if the person's license has been
 14  4 revoked for a second or subsequent time, or if the person has
 14  5 been convicted of tampering with or circumventing an ignition
 14  6 interlock device.
 14  7    The bill requires the department of transportation (DOT)
 14  8 to assess a monthly ignition interlock user fee to each user
 14  9 of an ignition interlock device. All ignition interlock user
 14 10 fees will be collected by the DOT and deposited in an ignition
 14 11 interlock indigent user fund (IIIUF). The bill requires the
 14 12 DOT to use the moneys in the IIIUF to assist indigent users
 14 13 of ignition interlock devices in paying for the use of the
 14 14 devices. The amount of the monthly ignition interlock user fee
 14 15 shall be set by the DOT so that the moneys in the IIIUF are
 14 16 sufficient to assist all indigent users of ignition interlock
 14 17 devices in paying for the use of the devices.
 14 18    Under the bill, a person is indigent if the person has an
 14 19 income level at or below 125 percent of the U.S. poverty level
 14 20 and the person is unable to pay for the cost of an ignition
 14 21 interlock device. A person is also indigent if the person has
 14 22 an income level greater than 125 percent, but at or below 200
 14 23 percent, of the U.S. poverty level and paying for the ignition
 14 24 interlock device would cause the person substantial hardship.
 14 25    The bill provides for county sobriety monitoring pilot
 14 26 programs. The bill allows the department of public health
 14 27 (DPH), in collaboration with the department of corrections,
 14 28 the department of public safety, and the DOT, to approve
 14 29 applications from counties for countywide sobriety monitoring
 14 30 pilot programs. The programs are to be available 24 hours per
 14 31 day, seven days per week, in an effort to reduce the number
 14 32 of crimes related to OWI.  One application shall be approved
 14 33 for a county with a population of 200,000 people or more, one
 14 34 application shall be approved for a county with a population of
 14 35 100,000 people or more but less than 200,000 people, and one
 15  1 application shall be approved for a county with a population of
 15  2 less than 100,000 people.
 15  3    The programs shall require individuals charged with or
 15  4 convicted of OWI to abstain from all chemical substances for
 15  5 a period of time. The programs are to require testing to
 15  6 determine whether a chemical substance is present at least
 15  7 twice per day at a central location where an immediate sanction
 15  8 can be applied or, where such testing is impractical, by
 15  9 continuous transdermal or electronic monitoring. The programs
 15 10 shall also apply sanctions when test results definitively
 15 11 indicate the presence of a chemical substance. The programs
 15 12 shall require participants to pay program costs and to install
 15 13 an ignition interlock device.
 15 14    A court in a county that has established a pilot program
 15 15 may order a defendant, as a condition of pretrial release,
 15 16 probation, or bond, to participate in the program. Approved
 15 17 pilot programs shall begin January 15, 2017, or upon the
 15 18 effective date of DPH rules, whichever is earlier, and shall
 15 19 be conducted for a minimum of one year. The DPH is to adopt
 15 20 rules to implement the programs, including but not limited to
 15 21 provisions relating to applications for, approval of, costs of,
 15 22 and oversight of the pilot programs and reporting requirements
 15 23 for participating counties. The DPH is directed to submit

 13 32 person's license revocation period is over, the person last
 13 33 failed a test by the ignition interlock device, or the person
 13 34 last failed to maintain the device as required, whichever is

 12 27 2017, or upon the effective date of department rules, whichever
 12 28 is earlier, and shall be conducted for a minimum of one year.
 12 29    5.  The department of public health shall adopt rules
 12 30 pursuant to chapter 17A to implement this section including
 12 31 but not limited to provisions relating to applications for,
 12 32 approval of, costs of, and oversight of the pilot programs and
 12 33 reporting requirements for participating counties.
 12 34    6.  The department of public health shall submit a report on
 12 35 the results of the pilot programs and make recommendations to
 13  1 the general assembly by December 15, 2018.
 13  2    7.  For the purposes of this section, "chemical substance"
 13  3 means alcohol, wine, spirits, and beer as defined in section
 13  4 123.3 and controlled substances as defined in section 124.101.
 13  5                           EXPLANATION
 13  6 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
 13  7 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
 13  8    Current law requires a person guilty of operating while
 13  9 intoxicated (OWI) to install an ignition interlock device in
 13 10 the person's vehicle if the person seeks a temporary restricted
 13 11 license, unless the person's alcohol concentration was less
 13 12 than .10 and no accident occurred. This bill strikes that
 13 13 exception, and also requires a person guilty of OWI to install
 13 14 an ignition interlock device in the person's vehicle upon the
 13 15 revocation of the person's driver's license rather than upon
 13 16 the person's application for a temporary restricted license.
 13 17    Under current law, an ignition interlock device is required
 13 18 to be installed in a person's vehicle for the period of time
 13 19 for which the person's temporary restricted license is issued,
 13 20 and up to one additional year after license reinstatement if
 13 21 the person has two or more OWI revocations. The bill requires
 13 22 the permanent installation of an ignition interlock device with
 13 23 two exceptions. If the ignition interlock device was installed
 13 24 as a result of the person's first OWI offense or revocation and
 13 25 a test was obtained, the device shall be uninstalled 180 days
 13 26 after the person's license was revoked, the person last failed
 13 27 a test by the ignition interlock device, or the defendant last
 13 28 failed to maintain the device as required, whichever is latest.
 13 29 If the ignition interlock device was installed as a result of
 13 30 the person's first OWI offense or revocation and a test was
 13 31 refused, the device shall be uninstalled 180 days after the
 13 32 person's license revocation period is over, the person last
 13 33 failed a test by the ignition interlock device, or the person
 13 34 last failed to maintain the device as required, whichever is
 13 35 latest.
 14  1 The bill provides an ignition interlock device shall not
 14  2 be uninstalled if the person has been convicted of a second
 14  3 or subsequent OWI violation, if the person's license has been
 14  4 revoked for a second or subsequent time, or if the person has
 14  5 been convicted of tampering with or circumventing an ignition
 14  6 interlock device.
 14  7    The bill requires the department of transportation (DOT)
 14  8 to assess a monthly ignition interlock user fee to each user
 14  9 of an ignition interlock device. All ignition interlock user
 14 10 fees will be collected by the DOT and deposited in an ignition
 14 11 interlock indigent user fund (IIIUF). The bill requires the
 14 12 DOT to use the moneys in the IIIUF to assist indigent users
 14 13 of ignition interlock devices in paying for the use of the
 14 14 devices. The amount of the monthly ignition interlock user fee
 14 15 shall be set by the DOT so that the moneys in the IIIUF are
 14 16 sufficient to assist all indigent users of ignition interlock
 14 17 devices in paying for the use of the devices.
 14 18    Under the bill, a person is indigent if the person has an
 14 19 income level at or below 125 percent of the U.S. poverty level
 14 20 and the person is unable to pay for the cost of an ignition
 14 21 interlock device. A person is also indigent if the person has
 14 22 an income level greater than 125 percent, but at or below 200
 14 23 percent, of the U.S. poverty level and paying for the ignition
 14 24 interlock device would cause the person substantial hardship.
 14 25    The bill provides for county sobriety monitoring pilot
 14 26 programs. The bill allows the department of public health
 14 27 (DPH), in collaboration with the department of corrections,
 14 28 the department of public safety, and the DOT, to approve
 14 29 applications from counties for countywide sobriety monitoring
 14 30 pilot programs. The programs are to be available 24 hours per
 14 31 day, seven days per week, in an effort to reduce the number
 14 32 of crimes related to OWI.  One application shall be approved
 14 33 for a county with a population of 200,000 people or more, one
 14 34 application shall be approved for a county with a population of
 14 35 100,000 people or more but less than 200,000 people, and one
 15  1 application shall be approved for a county with a population of
 15  2 less than 100,000 people.
 15  3    The programs shall require individuals charged with or
 15  4 convicted of OWI to abstain from all chemical substances for
 15  5 a period of time. The programs are to require testing to
 15  6 determine whether a chemical substance is present at least
 15  7 twice per day at a central location where an immediate sanction
 15  8 can be applied or, where such testing is impractical, by
 15  9 continuous transdermal or electronic monitoring. The programs
 15 10 shall also apply sanctions when test results definitively
 15 11 indicate the presence of a chemical substance. The programs
 15 12 shall require participants to pay program costs and to install
 15 13 an ignition interlock device.
 15 14    A court in a county that has established a pilot program
 15 15 may order a defendant, as a condition of pretrial release,
 15 16 probation, or bond, to participate in the program. Approved
 15 17 pilot programs shall begin January 15, 2017, or upon the
 15 18 effective date of DPH rules, whichever is earlier, and shall
 15 19 be conducted for a minimum of one year. The DPH is to adopt
 15 20 rules to implement the programs, including but not limited to
 15 21 provisions relating to applications for, approval of, costs of,
 15 22 and oversight of the pilot programs and reporting requirements
 15 23 for participating counties. The DPH is directed to submit
 15 24 a report on the results of the pilot programs and make
 15 25 recommendations to the general assembly by December 15, 2018.

 12 35 the results of the pilot programs and make recommendations to
 13  1 the general assembly by December 15, 2018.
 13  2    7.  For the purposes of this section, "chemical substance"
 13  3 means alcohol, wine, spirits, and beer as defined in section
 13  4 123.3 and controlled substances as defined in section 124.101.
 13  5                           EXPLANATION
 13  6 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
 13  7 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
 13  8    Current law requires a person guilty of operating while
 13  9 intoxicated (OWI) to install an ignition interlock device in
 13 10 the person's vehicle if the person seeks a temporary restricted
 13 11 license, unless the person's alcohol concentration was less
 13 12 than .10 and no accident occurred. This bill strikes that
 13 13 exception, and also requires a person guilty of OWI to install
 13 14 an ignition interlock device in the person's vehicle upon the
 13 15 revocation of the person's driver's license rather than upon
 13 16 the person's application for a temporary restricted license.
 13 17    Under current law, an ignition interlock device is required
 13 18 to be installed in a person's vehicle for the period of time
 13 19 for which the person's temporary restricted license is issued,
 13 20 and up to one additional year after license reinstatement if
 13 21 the person has two or more OWI revocations. The bill requires
 13 22 the permanent installation of an ignition interlock device with
 13 23 two exceptions. If the ignition interlock device was installed
 13 24 as a result of the person's first OWI offense or revocation and
 13 25 a test was obtained, the device shall be uninstalled 180 days
 13 26 after the person's license was revoked, the person last failed
 13 27 a test by the ignition interlock device, or the defendant last
 13 28 failed to maintain the device as required, whichever is latest.
 13 29 If the ignition interlock device was installed as a result of
 13 30 the person's first OWI offense or revocation and a test was
 13 31 refused, the device shall be uninstalled 180 days after the
 13 32 person's license revocation period is over, the person last
 13 33 failed a test by the ignition interlock device, or the person
 13 34 last failed to maintain the device as required, whichever is
 13 35 latest.
 14  1 The bill provides an ignition interlock device shall not
 14  2 be uninstalled if the person has been convicted of a second
 14  3 or subsequent OWI violation, if the person's license has been
 14  4 revoked for a second or subsequent time, or if the person has
 14  5 been convicted of tampering with or circumventing an ignition
 14  6 interlock device.
 14  7    The bill requires the department of transportation (DOT)
 14  8 to assess a monthly ignition interlock user fee to each user
 14  9 of an ignition interlock device. All ignition interlock user
 14 10 fees will be collected by the DOT and deposited in an ignition
 14 11 interlock indigent user fund (IIIUF). The bill requires the
 14 12 DOT to use the moneys in the IIIUF to assist indigent users
 14 13 of ignition interlock devices in paying for the use of the
 14 14 devices. The amount of the monthly ignition interlock user fee
 14 15 shall be set by the DOT so that the moneys in the IIIUF are
 14 16 sufficient to assist all indigent users of ignition interlock
 14 17 devices in paying for the use of the devices.
 14 18    Under the bill, a person is indigent if the person has an
 14 19 income level at or below 125 percent of the U.S. poverty level
 14 20 and the person is unable to pay for the cost of an ignition
 14 21 interlock device. A person is also indigent if the person has
 14 22 an income level greater than 125 percent, but at or below 200
 14 23 percent, of the U.S. poverty level and paying for the ignition
 14 24 interlock device would cause the person substantial hardship.
 14 25    The bill provides for county sobriety monitoring pilot
 14 26 programs. The bill allows the department of public health
 14 27 (DPH), in collaboration with the department of corrections,

 14 29 applications from counties for countywide sobriety monitoring
 14 30 pilot programs. The programs are to be available 24 hours per

 15  1 application shall be approved for a county with a population of
 15  2 less than 100,000 people.
 15  3    The programs shall require individuals charged with or
 15  4 convicted of OWI to abstain from all chemical substances for

 15 10 shall also apply sanctions when test results definitively
 15 11 indicate the presence of a chemical substance. The programs
 15 12 shall require participants to pay program costs and to install
 15 13 an ignition interlock device.
 15 14    A court in a county that has established a pilot program
 15 15 may order a defendant, as a condition of pretrial release,

 13 14 an ignition interlock device in the person's vehicle upon the
 13 15 revocation of the person's driver's license rather than upon
 13 16 the person's application for a temporary restricted license.
 13 17    Under current law, an ignition interlock device is required
 13 18 to be installed in a person's vehicle for the period of time
 13 19 for which the person's temporary restricted license is issued,

 13 32 person's license revocation period is over, the person last
 13 33 failed a test by the ignition interlock device, or the person
 13 34 last failed to maintain the device as required, whichever is
 13 35 latest.
 14  1 The bill provides an ignition interlock device shall not
 14  2 be uninstalled if the person has been convicted of a second
 14  3 or subsequent OWI violation, if the person's license has been
 14  4 revoked for a second or subsequent time, or if the person has

 14  7    The bill requires the department of transportation (DOT)
 14  8 to assess a monthly ignition interlock user fee to each user
 14  9 of an ignition interlock device. All ignition interlock user
 14 10 fees will be collected by the DOT and deposited in an ignition

 14 16 sufficient to assist all indigent users of ignition interlock
 14 17 devices in paying for the use of the devices.
 14 18    Under the bill, a person is indigent if the person has an
 14 19 income level at or below 125 percent of the U.S. poverty level
 14 20 and the person is unable to pay for the cost of an ignition
 14 21 interlock device. A person is also indigent if the person has
 14 22 an income level greater than 125 percent, but at or below 200

 14 24 interlock device would cause the person substantial hardship.
 14 25    The bill provides for county sobriety monitoring pilot
 14 26 programs. The bill allows the department of public health
 14 27 (DPH), in collaboration with the department of corrections,
 14 28 the department of public safety, and the DOT, to approve
 14 29 applications from counties for countywide sobriety monitoring
 14 30 pilot programs. The programs are to be available 24 hours per
 14 31 day, seven days per week, in an effort to reduce the number
 14 32 of crimes related to OWI.  One application shall be approved
 14 33 for a county with a population of 200,000 people or more, one
 14 34 application shall be approved for a county with a population of
 14 35 100,000 people or more but less than 200,000 people, and one
 15  1 application shall be approved for a county with a population of
 15  2 less than 100,000 people.
 15  3    The programs shall require individuals charged with or
 15  4 convicted of OWI to abstain from all chemical substances for

 14  6 interlock device.
 14  7    The bill requires the department of transportation (DOT)
 14  8 to assess a monthly ignition interlock user fee to each user
 14  9 of an ignition interlock device. All ignition interlock user
 14 10 fees will be collected by the DOT and deposited in an ignition
 14 11 interlock indigent user fund (IIIUF). The bill requires the
 14 12 DOT to use the moneys in the IIIUF to assist indigent users
 14 13 of ignition interlock devices in paying for the use of the
 14 14 devices. The amount of the monthly ignition interlock user fee
 14 15 shall be set by the DOT so that the moneys in the IIIUF are
 14 16 sufficient to assist all indigent users of ignition interlock
 14 17 devices in paying for the use of the devices.
 14 18    Under the bill, a person is indigent if the person has an
 14 19 income level at or below 125 percent of the U.S. poverty level
 14 20 and the person is unable to pay for the cost of an ignition
 14 21 interlock device. A person is also indigent if the person has
 14 22 an income level greater than 125 percent, but at or below 200
 14 23 percent, of the U.S. poverty level and paying for the ignition
 14 24 interlock device would cause the person substantial hardship.
 14 25    The bill provides for county sobriety monitoring pilot
 14 26 programs. The bill allows the department of public health
 14 27 (DPH), in collaboration with the department of corrections,
 14 28 the department of public safety, and the DOT, to approve
 14 29 applications from counties for countywide sobriety monitoring
 14 30 pilot programs. The programs are to be available 24 hours per
 14 31 day, seven days per week, in an effort to reduce the number
 14 32 of crimes related to OWI.  One application shall be approved
 14 33 for a county with a population of 200,000 people or more, one
 14 34 application shall be approved for a county with a population of
 14 35 100,000 people or more but less than 200,000 people, and one
 15  1 application shall be approved for a county with a population of
 15  2 less than 100,000 people.
 15  3    The programs shall require individuals charged with or
 15  4 convicted of OWI to abstain from all chemical substances for
 15  5 a period of time. The programs are to require testing to
 15  6 determine whether a chemical substance is present at least
 15  7 twice per day at a central location where an immediate sanction
 15  8 can be applied or, where such testing is impractical, by
 15  9 continuous transdermal or electronic monitoring. The programs
 15 10 shall also apply sanctions when test results definitively
 15 11 indicate the presence of a chemical substance. The programs
 15 12 shall require participants to pay program costs and to install
 15 13 an ignition interlock device.
 15 14    A court in a county that has established a pilot program
 15 15 may order a defendant, as a condition of pretrial release,
 15 16 probation, or bond, to participate in the program. Approved
 15 17 pilot programs shall begin January 15, 2017, or upon the
 15 18 effective date of DPH rules, whichever is earlier, and shall
 15 19 be conducted for a minimum of one year. The DPH is to adopt
 15 20 rules to implement the programs, including but not limited to
 15 21 provisions relating to applications for, approval of, costs of,
 15 22 and oversight of the pilot programs and reporting requirements
 15 23 for participating counties. The DPH is directed to submit
 15 24 a report on the results of the pilot programs and make

 13  2    7.  For the purposes of this section, "chemical substance"
 13  3 means alcohol, wine, spirits, and beer as defined in section
 13  4 123.3 and controlled substances as defined in section 124.101.
 13  5                           EXPLANATION
 13  6 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
 13  7 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
 13  8    Current law requires a person guilty of operating while
 13  9 intoxicated (OWI) to install an ignition interlock device in
 13 10 the person's vehicle if the person seeks a temporary restricted
 13 11 license, unless the person's alcohol concentration was less
 13 12 than .10 and no accident occurred. This bill strikes that
 13 13 exception, and also requires a person guilty of OWI to install
 13 14 an ignition interlock device in the person's vehicle upon the
 13 15 revocation of the person's driver's license rather than upon
 13 16 the person's application for a temporary restricted license.
 13 17    Under current law, an ignition interlock device is required
 13 18 to be installed in a person's vehicle for the period of time
 13 19 for which the person's temporary restricted license is issued,
 13 20 and up to one additional year after license reinstatement if
 13 21 the person has two or more OWI revocations. The bill requires
 13 22 the permanent installation of an ignition interlock device with
 13 23 two exceptions. If the ignition interlock device was installed
 13 24 as a result of the person's first OWI offense or revocation and
 13 25 a test was obtained, the device shall be uninstalled 180 days
 13 26 after the person's license was revoked, the person last failed
 13 27 a test by the ignition interlock device, or the defendant last
 13 28 failed to maintain the device as required, whichever is latest.
 13 29 If the ignition interlock device was installed as a result of
 13 30 the person's first OWI offense or revocation and a test was
 13 31 refused, the device shall be uninstalled 180 days after the
 13 32 person's license revocation period is over, the person last
 13 33 failed a test by the ignition interlock device, or the person
 13 34 last failed to maintain the device as required, whichever is
 13 35 latest.
 14  1 The bill provides an ignition interlock device shall not
 14  2 be uninstalled if the person has been convicted of a second
 14  3 or subsequent OWI violation, if the person's license has been
 14  4 revoked for a second or subsequent time, or if the person has
 14  5 been convicted of tampering with or circumventing an ignition
 14  6 interlock device.
 14  7    The bill requires the department of transportation (DOT)
 14  8 to assess a monthly ignition interlock user fee to each user
 14  9 of an ignition interlock device. All ignition interlock user
 14 10 fees will be collected by the DOT and deposited in an ignition
 14 11 interlock indigent user fund (IIIUF). The bill requires the
 14 12 DOT to use the moneys in the IIIUF to assist indigent users
 14 13 of ignition interlock devices in paying for the use of the
 14 14 devices. The amount of the monthly ignition interlock user fee
 14 15 shall be set by the DOT so that the moneys in the IIIUF are
 14 16 sufficient to assist all indigent users of ignition interlock
 14 17 devices in paying for the use of the devices.
 14 18    Under the bill, a person is indigent if the person has an
 14 19 income level at or below 125 percent of the U.S. poverty level
 14 20 and the person is unable to pay for the cost of an ignition
 14 21 interlock device. A person is also indigent if the person has
 14 22 an income level greater than 125 percent, but at or below 200
 14 23 percent, of the U.S. poverty level and paying for the ignition
 14 24 interlock device would cause the person substantial hardship.

 14 34 application shall be approved for a county with a population of
 14 35 100,000 people or more but less than 200,000 people, and one
 15  1 application shall be approved for a county with a population of
 15  2 less than 100,000 people.
 15  3    The programs shall require individuals charged with or
 15  4 convicted of OWI to abstain from all chemical substances for
 15  5 a period of time. The programs are to require testing to
 15  6 determine whether a chemical substance is present at least
 15  7 twice per day at a central location where an immediate sanction

 15 10 shall also apply sanctions when test results definitively
 15 11 indicate the presence of a chemical substance. The programs
 15 12 shall require participants to pay program costs and to install
 15 13 an ignition interlock device.
 15 14    A court in a county that has established a pilot program
 15 15 may order a defendant, as a condition of pretrial release,

 15 17 pilot programs shall begin January 15, 2017, or upon the
 15 18 effective date of DPH rules, whichever is earlier, and shall
 15 19 be conducted for a minimum of one year. The DPH is to adopt

 12 24 of pretrial release, probation, or bond, to participate in the
 12 25 program.
 12 26    4.  An approved pilot program shall begin on January 15,
 12 27 2017, or upon the effective date of department rules, whichever
 12 28 is earlier, and shall be conducted for a minimum of one year.
 12 29    5.  The department of public health shall adopt rules
 12 30 pursuant to chapter 17A to implement this section including
 12 31 but not limited to provisions relating to applications for,
 12 32 approval of, costs of, and oversight of the pilot programs and
 12 33 reporting requirements for participating counties.
 12 34    6.  The department of public health shall submit a report on
 12 35 the results of the pilot programs and make recommendations to
 13  1 the general assembly by December 15, 2018.
 13  2    7.  For the purposes of this section, "chemical substance"
 13  3 means alcohol, wine, spirits, and beer as defined in section
 13  4 123.3 and controlled substances as defined in section 124.101.
 13  5                           EXPLANATION
 13  6 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
 13  7 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
 13  8    Current law requires a person guilty of operating while
 13  9 intoxicated (OWI) to install an ignition interlock device in
 13 10 the person's vehicle if the person seeks a temporary restricted
 13 11 license, unless the person's alcohol concentration was less
 13 12 than .10 and no accident occurred. This bill strikes that
 13 13 exception, and also requires a person guilty of OWI to install
 13 14 an ignition interlock device in the person's vehicle upon the
 13 15 revocation of the person's driver's license rather than upon
 13 16 the person's application for a temporary restricted license.
 13 17    Under current law, an ignition interlock device is required
 13 18 to be installed in a person's vehicle for the period of time
 13 19 for which the person's temporary restricted license is issued,
 13 20 and up to one additional year after license reinstatement if
 13 21 the person has two or more OWI revocations. The bill requires
 13 22 the permanent installation of an ignition interlock device with
 13 23 two exceptions. If the ignition interlock device was installed
 13 24 as a result of the person's first OWI offense or revocation and
 13 25 a test was obtained, the device shall be uninstalled 180 days
 13 26 after the person's license was revoked, the person last failed
 13 27 a test by the ignition interlock device, or the defendant last
 13 28 failed to maintain the device as required, whichever is latest.
 13 29 If the ignition interlock device was installed as a result of
 13 30 the person's first OWI offense or revocation and a test was
 13 31 refused, the device shall be uninstalled 180 days after the
 13 32 person's license revocation period is over, the person last
 13 33 failed a test by the ignition interlock device, or the person
 13 34 last failed to maintain the device as required, whichever is
 13 35 latest.
 14  1 The bill provides an ignition interlock device shall not
 14  2 be uninstalled if the person has been convicted of a second
 14  3 or subsequent OWI violation, if the person's license has been
 14  4 revoked for a second or subsequent time, or if the person has
 14  5 been convicted of tampering with or circumventing an ignition
 14  6 interlock device.
 14  7    The bill requires the department of transportation (DOT)
 14  8 to assess a monthly ignition interlock user fee to each user
 14  9 of an ignition interlock device. All ignition interlock user
 14 10 fees will be collected by the DOT and deposited in an ignition
 14 11 interlock indigent user fund (IIIUF). The bill requires the
 14 12 DOT to use the moneys in the IIIUF to assist indigent users
 14 13 of ignition interlock devices in paying for the use of the
 14 14 devices. The amount of the monthly ignition interlock user fee
 14 15 shall be set by the DOT so that the moneys in the IIIUF are
 14 16 sufficient to assist all indigent users of ignition interlock
 14 17 devices in paying for the use of the devices.
 14 18    Under the bill, a person is indigent if the person has an
 14 19 income level at or below 125 percent of the U.S. poverty level
 14 20 and the person is unable to pay for the cost of an ignition
 14 21 interlock device. A person is also indigent if the person has
 14 22 an income level greater than 125 percent, but at or below 200
 14 23 percent, of the U.S. poverty level and paying for the ignition
 14 24 interlock device would cause the person substantial hardship.
 14 25    The bill provides for county sobriety monitoring pilot
 14 26 programs. The bill allows the department of public health
 14 27 (DPH), in collaboration with the department of corrections,
 14 28 the department of public safety, and the DOT, to approve
 14 29 applications from counties for countywide sobriety monitoring
 14 30 pilot programs. The programs are to be available 24 hours per
 14 31 day, seven days per week, in an effort to reduce the number
 14 32 of crimes related to OWI.  One application shall be approved
 14 33 for a county with a population of 200,000 people or more, one
 14 34 application shall be approved for a county with a population of
 14 35 100,000 people or more but less than 200,000 people, and one
 15  1 application shall be approved for a county with a population of
 15  2 less than 100,000 people.
 15  3    The programs shall require individuals charged with or
 15  4 convicted of OWI to abstain from all chemical substances for
 15  5 a period of time. The programs are to require testing to
 15  6 determine whether a chemical substance is present at least
 15  7 twice per day at a central location where an immediate sanction
 15  8 can be applied or, where such testing is impractical, by
 15  9 continuous transdermal or electronic monitoring. The programs
 15 10 shall also apply sanctions when test results definitively
 15 11 indicate the presence of a chemical substance. The programs
 15 12 shall require participants to pay program costs and to install
 15 13 an ignition interlock device.
 15 14    A court in a county that has established a pilot program
 15 15 may order a defendant, as a condition of pretrial release,
 15 16 probation, or bond, to participate in the program. Approved
 15 17 pilot programs shall begin January 15, 2017, or upon the
 15 18 effective date of DPH rules, whichever is earlier, and shall
 15 19 be conducted for a minimum of one year. The DPH is to adopt
 15 20 rules to implement the programs, including but not limited to
 15 21 provisions relating to applications for, approval of, costs of,
 15 22 and oversight of the pilot programs and reporting requirements
 15 23 for participating counties. The DPH is directed to submit
 15 24 a report on the results of the pilot programs and make
 15 25 recommendations to the general assembly by December 15, 2018.

 14 23 percent, of the U.S. poverty level and paying for the ignition
 14 24 interlock device would cause the person substantial hardship.
 14 25    The bill provides for county sobriety monitoring pilot
 14 26 programs. The bill allows the department of public health
 14 27 (DPH), in collaboration with the department of corrections,
 14 28 the department of public safety, and the DOT, to approve
 14 29 applications from counties for countywide sobriety monitoring
 14 30 pilot programs. The programs are to be available 24 hours per
 14 31 day, seven days per week, in an effort to reduce the number
 14 32 of crimes related to OWI.  One application shall be approved
 14 33 for a county with a population of 200,000 people or more, one
 14 34 application shall be approved for a county with a population of
 14 35 100,000 people or more but less than 200,000 people, and one
 15  1 application shall be approved for a county with a population of
 15  2 less than 100,000 people.
 15  3    The programs shall require individuals charged with or
 15  4 convicted of OWI to abstain from all chemical substances for
 15  5 a period of time. The programs are to require testing to
 15  6 determine whether a chemical substance is present at least
 15  7 twice per day at a central location where an immediate sanction
 15  8 can be applied or, where such testing is impractical, by
 15  9 continuous transdermal or electronic monitoring. The programs
 15 10 shall also apply sanctions when test results definitively
 15 11 indicate the presence of a chemical substance. The programs
 15 12 shall require participants to pay program costs and to install
 15 13 an ignition interlock device.
 15 14    A court in a county that has established a pilot program
 15 15 may order a defendant, as a condition of pretrial release,
 15 16 probation, or bond, to participate in the program. Approved
 15 17 pilot programs shall begin January 15, 2017, or upon the
 15 18 effective date of DPH rules, whichever is earlier, and shall
 15 19 be conducted for a minimum of one year. The DPH is to adopt

 13  5                           EXPLANATION
 13  6 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
 13  7 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
 13  8    Current law requires a person guilty of operating while
 13  9 intoxicated (OWI) to install an ignition interlock device in
 13 10 the person's vehicle if the person seeks a temporary restricted
 13 11 license, unless the person's alcohol concentration was less
 13 12 than .10 and no accident occurred. This bill strikes that
 13 13 exception, and also requires a person guilty of OWI to install
 13 14 an ignition interlock device in the person's vehicle upon the
 13 15 revocation of the person's driver's license rather than upon
 13 16 the person's application for a temporary restricted license.
 13 17    Under current law, an ignition interlock device is required
 13 18 to be installed in a person's vehicle for the period of time
 13 19 for which the person's temporary restricted license is issued,
 13 20 and up to one additional year after license reinstatement if
 13 21 the person has two or more OWI revocations. The bill requires
 13 22 the permanent installation of an ignition interlock device with
 13 23 two exceptions. If the ignition interlock device was installed
 13 24 as a result of the person's first OWI offense or revocation and
 13 25 a test was obtained, the device shall be uninstalled 180 days
 13 26 after the person's license was revoked, the person last failed
 13 27 a test by the ignition interlock device, or the defendant last
 13 28 failed to maintain the device as required, whichever is latest.
 13 29 If the ignition interlock device was installed as a result of
 13 30 the person's first OWI offense or revocation and a test was
 13 31 refused, the device shall be uninstalled 180 days after the
 13 32 person's license revocation period is over, the person last
 13 33 failed a test by the ignition interlock device, or the person
 13 34 last failed to maintain the device as required, whichever is
 13 35 latest.
 14  1 The bill provides an ignition interlock device shall not
 14  2 be uninstalled if the person has been convicted of a second
 14  3 or subsequent OWI violation, if the person's license has been
 14  4 revoked for a second or subsequent time, or if the person has
 14  5 been convicted of tampering with or circumventing an ignition
 14  6 interlock device.
 14  7    The bill requires the department of transportation (DOT)
 14  8 to assess a monthly ignition interlock user fee to each user
 14  9 of an ignition interlock device. All ignition interlock user
 14 10 fees will be collected by the DOT and deposited in an ignition
 14 11 interlock indigent user fund (IIIUF). The bill requires the
 14 12 DOT to use the moneys in the IIIUF to assist indigent users
 14 13 of ignition interlock devices in paying for the use of the
 14 14 devices. The amount of the monthly ignition interlock user fee
 14 15 shall be set by the DOT so that the moneys in the IIIUF are
 14 16 sufficient to assist all indigent users of ignition interlock
 14 17 devices in paying for the use of the devices.
 14 18    Under the bill, a person is indigent if the person has an
 14 19 income level at or below 125 percent of the U.S. poverty level
 14 20 and the person is unable to pay for the cost of an ignition
 14 21 interlock device. A person is also indigent if the person has
 14 22 an income level greater than 125 percent, but at or below 200
 14 23 percent, of the U.S. poverty level and paying for the ignition
 14 24 interlock device would cause the person substantial hardship.

 14 26 programs. The bill allows the department of public health

 14 34 application shall be approved for a county with a population of
 14 35 100,000 people or more but less than 200,000 people, and one
 15  1 application shall be approved for a county with a population of
 15  2 less than 100,000 people.
 15  3    The programs shall require individuals charged with or
 15  4 convicted of OWI to abstain from all chemical substances for
 15  5 a period of time. The programs are to require testing to
 15  6 determine whether a chemical substance is present at least
 15  7 twice per day at a central location where an immediate sanction
 15  8 can be applied or, where such testing is impractical, by

 15 12 shall require participants to pay program costs and to install

 15 14    A court in a county that has established a pilot program
 15 15 may order a defendant, as a condition of pretrial release,

 15 17 pilot programs shall begin January 15, 2017, or upon the

 13 32 person's license revocation period is over, the person last
 13 33 failed a test by the ignition interlock device, or the person
 13 34 last failed to maintain the device as required, whichever is
 13 35 latest.
 14  1 The bill provides an ignition interlock device shall not
 14  2 be uninstalled if the person has been convicted of a second
 14  3 or subsequent OWI violation, if the person's license has been
 14  4 revoked for a second or subsequent time, or if the person has
 14  5 been convicted of tampering with or circumventing an ignition
 14  6 interlock device.
 14  7    The bill requires the department of transportation (DOT)
 14  8 to assess a monthly ignition interlock user fee to each user
 14  9 of an ignition interlock device. All ignition interlock user
 14 10 fees will be collected by the DOT and deposited in an ignition
 14 11 interlock indigent user fund (IIIUF). The bill requires the
 14 12 DOT to use the moneys in the IIIUF to assist indigent users
 14 13 of ignition interlock devices in paying for the use of the
 14 14 devices. The amount of the monthly ignition interlock user fee
 14 15 shall be set by the DOT so that the moneys in the IIIUF are
 14 16 sufficient to assist all indigent users of ignition interlock
 14 17 devices in paying for the use of the devices.
 14 18    Under the bill, a person is indigent if the person has an
 14 19 income level at or below 125 percent of the U.S. poverty level
 14 20 and the person is unable to pay for the cost of an ignition
 14 21 interlock device. A person is also indigent if the person has
 14 22 an income level greater than 125 percent, but at or below 200
 14 23 percent, of the U.S. poverty level and paying for the ignition
 14 24 interlock device would cause the person substantial hardship.
 14 25    The bill provides for county sobriety monitoring pilot
 14 26 programs. The bill allows the department of public health
 14 27 (DPH), in collaboration with the department of corrections,
 14 28 the department of public safety, and the DOT, to approve
 14 29 applications from counties for countywide sobriety monitoring
 14 30 pilot programs. The programs are to be available 24 hours per
 14 31 day, seven days per week, in an effort to reduce the number
 14 32 of crimes related to OWI.  One application shall be approved
 14 33 for a county with a population of 200,000 people or more, one
 14 34 application shall be approved for a county with a population of
 14 35 100,000 people or more but less than 200,000 people, and one
 15  1 application shall be approved for a county with a population of
 15  2 less than 100,000 people.
 15  3    The programs shall require individuals charged with or
 15  4 convicted of OWI to abstain from all chemical substances for
 15  5 a period of time. The programs are to require testing to
 15  6 determine whether a chemical substance is present at least
 15  7 twice per day at a central location where an immediate sanction
 15  8 can be applied or, where such testing is impractical, by
 15  9 continuous transdermal or electronic monitoring. The programs
 15 10 shall also apply sanctions when test results definitively
 15 11 indicate the presence of a chemical substance. The programs
 15 12 shall require participants to pay program costs and to install
 15 13 an ignition interlock device.
 15 14    A court in a county that has established a pilot program
 15 15 may order a defendant, as a condition of pretrial release,
 15 16 probation, or bond, to participate in the program. Approved
 15 17 pilot programs shall begin January 15, 2017, or upon the
 15 18 effective date of DPH rules, whichever is earlier, and shall
 15 19 be conducted for a minimum of one year. The DPH is to adopt
 15 20 rules to implement the programs, including but not limited to
 15 21 provisions relating to applications for, approval of, costs of,
 15 22 and oversight of the pilot programs and reporting requirements
 15 23 for participating counties. The DPH is directed to submit

 13  6 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
 13  7 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
 13  8    Current law requires a person guilty of operating while
 13  9 intoxicated (OWI) to install an ignition interlock device in
 13 10 the person's vehicle if the person seeks a temporary restricted
 13 11 license, unless the person's alcohol concentration was less
 13 12 than .10 and no accident occurred. This bill strikes that
 13 13 exception, and also requires a person guilty of OWI to install
 13 14 an ignition interlock device in the person's vehicle upon the
 13 15 revocation of the person's driver's license rather than upon
 13 16 the person's application for a temporary restricted license.
 13 17    Under current law, an ignition interlock device is required
 13 18 to be installed in a person's vehicle for the period of time
 13 19 for which the person's temporary restricted license is issued,
 13 20 and up to one additional year after license reinstatement if
 13 21 the person has two or more OWI revocations. The bill requires
 13 22 the permanent installation of an ignition interlock device with
 13 23 two exceptions. If the ignition interlock device was installed
 13 24 as a result of the person's first OWI offense or revocation and
 13 25 a test was obtained, the device shall be uninstalled 180 days
 13 26 after the person's license was revoked, the person last failed
 13 27 a test by the ignition interlock device, or the defendant last
 13 28 failed to maintain the device as required, whichever is latest.
 13 29 If the ignition interlock device was installed as a result of
 13 30 the person's first OWI offense or revocation and a test was
 13 31 refused, the device shall be uninstalled 180 days after the
 13 32 person's license revocation period is over, the person last

 13 24 as a result of the person's first OWI offense or revocation and
 13 25 a test was obtained, the device shall be uninstalled 180 days
 13 26 after the person's license was revoked, the person last failed

 13 33 failed a test by the ignition interlock device, or the person
 13 34 last failed to maintain the device as required, whichever is
 13 35 latest.
 14  1 The bill provides an ignition interlock device shall not
 14  2 be uninstalled if the person has been convicted of a second
 14  3 or subsequent OWI violation, if the person's license has been
 14  4 revoked for a second or subsequent time, or if the person has
 14  5 been convicted of tampering with or circumventing an ignition
 14  6 interlock device.
 14  7    The bill requires the department of transportation (DOT)
 14  8 to assess a monthly ignition interlock user fee to each user
 14  9 of an ignition interlock device. All ignition interlock user
 14 10 fees will be collected by the DOT and deposited in an ignition
 14 11 interlock indigent user fund (IIIUF). The bill requires the
 14 12 DOT to use the moneys in the IIIUF to assist indigent users
 14 13 of ignition interlock devices in paying for the use of the
 14 14 devices. The amount of the monthly ignition interlock user fee
 14 15 shall be set by the DOT so that the moneys in the IIIUF are
 14 16 sufficient to assist all indigent users of ignition interlock
 14 17 devices in paying for the use of the devices.
 14 18    Under the bill, a person is indigent if the person has an
 14 19 income level at or below 125 percent of the U.S. poverty level
 14 20 and the person is unable to pay for the cost of an ignition
 14 21 interlock device. A person is also indigent if the person has
 14 22 an income level greater than 125 percent, but at or below 200
 14 23 percent, of the U.S. poverty level and paying for the ignition
 14 24 interlock device would cause the person substantial hardship.
 14 25    The bill provides for county sobriety monitoring pilot
 14 26 programs. The bill allows the department of public health
 14 27 (DPH), in collaboration with the department of corrections,
 14 28 the department of public safety, and the DOT, to approve
 14 29 applications from counties for countywide sobriety monitoring
 14 30 pilot programs. The programs are to be available 24 hours per
 14 31 day, seven days per week, in an effort to reduce the number
 14 32 of crimes related to OWI.  One application shall be approved
 14 33 for a county with a population of 200,000 people or more, one
 14 34 application shall be approved for a county with a population of
 14 35 100,000 people or more but less than 200,000 people, and one
 15  1 application shall be approved for a county with a population of
 15  2 less than 100,000 people.
 15  3    The programs shall require individuals charged with or
 15  4 convicted of OWI to abstain from all chemical substances for
 15  5 a period of time. The programs are to require testing to
 15  6 determine whether a chemical substance is present at least
 15  7 twice per day at a central location where an immediate sanction
 15  8 can be applied or, where such testing is impractical, by
 15  9 continuous transdermal or electronic monitoring. The programs
 15 10 shall also apply sanctions when test results definitively
 15 11 indicate the presence of a chemical substance. The programs
 15 12 shall require participants to pay program costs and to install
 15 13 an ignition interlock device.
 15 14    A court in a county that has established a pilot program
 15 15 may order a defendant, as a condition of pretrial release,
 15 16 probation, or bond, to participate in the program. Approved
 15 17 pilot programs shall begin January 15, 2017, or upon the
 15 18 effective date of DPH rules, whichever is earlier, and shall
 15 19 be conducted for a minimum of one year. The DPH is to adopt

 13 31 refused, the device shall be uninstalled 180 days after the
 13 32 person's license revocation period is over, the person last
 13 33 failed a test by the ignition interlock device, or the person
 13 34 last failed to maintain the device as required, whichever is
 13 35 latest.
 14  1 The bill provides an ignition interlock device shall not
 14  2 be uninstalled if the person has been convicted of a second
 14  3 or subsequent OWI violation, if the person's license has been
 14  4 revoked for a second or subsequent time, or if the person has
 14  5 been convicted of tampering with or circumventing an ignition
 14  6 interlock device.
 14  7    The bill requires the department of transportation (DOT)
 14  8 to assess a monthly ignition interlock user fee to each user
 14  9 of an ignition interlock device. All ignition interlock user
 14 10 fees will be collected by the DOT and deposited in an ignition
 14 11 interlock indigent user fund (IIIUF). The bill requires the
 14 12 DOT to use the moneys in the IIIUF to assist indigent users
 14 13 of ignition interlock devices in paying for the use of the
 14 14 devices. The amount of the monthly ignition interlock user fee
 14 15 shall be set by the DOT so that the moneys in the IIIUF are
 14 16 sufficient to assist all indigent users of ignition interlock
 14 17 devices in paying for the use of the devices.
 14 18    Under the bill, a person is indigent if the person has an
 14 19 income level at or below 125 percent of the U.S. poverty level
 14 20 and the person is unable to pay for the cost of an ignition
 14 21 interlock device. A person is also indigent if the person has
 14 22 an income level greater than 125 percent, but at or below 200
 14 23 percent, of the U.S. poverty level and paying for the ignition
 14 24 interlock device would cause the person substantial hardship.
 14 25    The bill provides for county sobriety monitoring pilot
 14 26 programs. The bill allows the department of public health
 14 27 (DPH), in collaboration with the department of corrections,
 14 28 the department of public safety, and the DOT, to approve
 14 29 applications from counties for countywide sobriety monitoring
 14 30 pilot programs. The programs are to be available 24 hours per
 14 31 day, seven days per week, in an effort to reduce the number
 14 32 of crimes related to OWI.  One application shall be approved
 14 33 for a county with a population of 200,000 people or more, one
 14 34 application shall be approved for a county with a population of
 14 35 100,000 people or more but less than 200,000 people, and one
 15  1 application shall be approved for a county with a population of
 15  2 less than 100,000 people.
 15  3    The programs shall require individuals charged with or
 15  4 convicted of OWI to abstain from all chemical substances for
 15  5 a period of time. The programs are to require testing to
 15  6 determine whether a chemical substance is present at least
 15  7 twice per day at a central location where an immediate sanction
 15  8 can be applied or, where such testing is impractical, by
 15  9 continuous transdermal or electronic monitoring. The programs
 15 10 shall also apply sanctions when test results definitively
 15 11 indicate the presence of a chemical substance. The programs
 15 12 shall require participants to pay program costs and to install
 15 13 an ignition interlock device.
 15 14    A court in a county that has established a pilot program
 15 15 may order a defendant, as a condition of pretrial release,
 15 16 probation, or bond, to participate in the program. Approved
 15 17 pilot programs shall begin January 15, 2017, or upon the
 15 18 effective date of DPH rules, whichever is earlier, and shall
 15 19 be conducted for a minimum of one year. The DPH is to adopt
 15 20 rules to implement the programs, including but not limited to
 15 21 provisions relating to applications for, approval of, costs of,
 15 22 and oversight of the pilot programs and reporting requirements
 15 23 for participating counties. The DPH is directed to submit
 15 24 a report on the results of the pilot programs and make
 15 25 recommendations to the general assembly by December 15, 2018.

 13  7 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
 13  8    Current law requires a person guilty of operating while
 13  9 intoxicated (OWI) to install an ignition interlock device in
 13 10 the person's vehicle if the person seeks a temporary restricted
 13 11 license, unless the person's alcohol concentration was less
 13 12 than .10 and no accident occurred. This bill strikes that
 13 13 exception, and also requires a person guilty of OWI to install
 13 14 an ignition interlock device in the person's vehicle upon the
 13 15 revocation of the person's driver's license rather than upon
 13 16 the person's application for a temporary restricted license.
 13 17    Under current law, an ignition interlock device is required
 13 18 to be installed in a person's vehicle for the period of time
 13 19 for which the person's temporary restricted license is issued,
 13 20 and up to one additional year after license reinstatement if
 13 21 the person has two or more OWI revocations. The bill requires
 13 22 the permanent installation of an ignition interlock device with
 13 23 two exceptions. If the ignition interlock device was installed
 13 24 as a result of the person's first OWI offense or revocation and
 13 25 a test was obtained, the device shall be uninstalled 180 days
 13 26 after the person's license was revoked, the person last failed
 13 27 a test by the ignition interlock device, or the defendant last
 13 28 failed to maintain the device as required, whichever is latest.
 13 29 If the ignition interlock device was installed as a result of
 13 30 the person's first OWI offense or revocation and a test was
 13 31 refused, the device shall be uninstalled 180 days after the
 13 32 person's license revocation period is over, the person last
 13 33 failed a test by the ignition interlock device, or the person
 13 34 last failed to maintain the device as required, whichever is
 13 35 latest.
 14  1 The bill provides an ignition interlock device shall not
 14  2 be uninstalled if the person has been convicted of a second
 14  3 or subsequent OWI violation, if the person's license has been
 14  4 revoked for a second or subsequent time, or if the person has
 14  5 been convicted of tampering with or circumventing an ignition
 14  6 interlock device.
 14  7    The bill requires the department of transportation (DOT)
 14  8 to assess a monthly ignition interlock user fee to each user
 14  9 of an ignition interlock device. All ignition interlock user
 14 10 fees will be collected by the DOT and deposited in an ignition
 14 11 interlock indigent user fund (IIIUF). The bill requires the
 14 12 DOT to use the moneys in the IIIUF to assist indigent users
 14 13 of ignition interlock devices in paying for the use of the
 14 14 devices. The amount of the monthly ignition interlock user fee
 14 15 shall be set by the DOT so that the moneys in the IIIUF are
 14 16 sufficient to assist all indigent users of ignition interlock
 14 17 devices in paying for the use of the devices.
 14 18    Under the bill, a person is indigent if the person has an
 14 19 income level at or below 125 percent of the U.S. poverty level
 14 20 and the person is unable to pay for the cost of an ignition
 14 21 interlock device. A person is also indigent if the person has
 14 22 an income level greater than 125 percent, but at or below 200
 14 23 percent, of the U.S. poverty level and paying for the ignition
 14 24 interlock device would cause the person substantial hardship.

 15  1 application shall be approved for a county with a population of
 15  2 less than 100,000 people.
 15  3    The programs shall require individuals charged with or
 15  4 convicted of OWI to abstain from all chemical substances for

 15 11 indicate the presence of a chemical substance. The programs
 15 12 shall require participants to pay program costs and to install
 15 13 an ignition interlock device.
 15 14    A court in a county that has established a pilot program
 15 15 may order a defendant, as a condition of pretrial release,
 15 16 probation, or bond, to participate in the program. Approved
 15 17 pilot programs shall begin January 15, 2017, or upon the

 15 19 be conducted for a minimum of one year. The DPH is to adopt

 13 15 revocation of the person's driver's license rather than upon
 13 16 the person's application for a temporary restricted license.
 13 17    Under current law, an ignition interlock device is required
 13 18 to be installed in a person's vehicle for the period of time
 13 19 for which the person's temporary restricted license is issued,
 13 20 and up to one additional year after license reinstatement if
 13 21 the person has two or more OWI revocations. The bill requires
 13 22 the permanent installation of an ignition interlock device with
 13 23 two exceptions. If the ignition interlock device was installed
 13 24 as a result of the person's first OWI offense or revocation and
 13 25 a test was obtained, the device shall be uninstalled 180 days
 13 26 after the person's license was revoked, the person last failed
 13 27 a test by the ignition interlock device, or the defendant last
 13 28 failed to maintain the device as required, whichever is latest.
 13 29 If the ignition interlock device was installed as a result of
 13 30 the person's first OWI offense or revocation and a test was
 13 31 refused, the device shall be uninstalled 180 days after the
 13 32 person's license revocation period is over, the person last
 13 33 failed a test by the ignition interlock device, or the person
 13 34 last failed to maintain the device as required, whichever is
 13 35 latest.
 14  1 The bill provides an ignition interlock device shall not
 14  2 be uninstalled if the person has been convicted of a second
 14  3 or subsequent OWI violation, if the person's license has been
 14  4 revoked for a second or subsequent time, or if the person has
 14  5 been convicted of tampering with or circumventing an ignition
 14  6 interlock device.
 14  7    The bill requires the department of transportation (DOT)
 14  8 to assess a monthly ignition interlock user fee to each user
 14  9 of an ignition interlock device. All ignition interlock user
 14 10 fees will be collected by the DOT and deposited in an ignition
 14 11 interlock indigent user fund (IIIUF). The bill requires the
 14 12 DOT to use the moneys in the IIIUF to assist indigent users
 14 13 of ignition interlock devices in paying for the use of the
 14 14 devices. The amount of the monthly ignition interlock user fee
 14 15 shall be set by the DOT so that the moneys in the IIIUF are
 14 16 sufficient to assist all indigent users of ignition interlock
 14 17 devices in paying for the use of the devices.
 14 18    Under the bill, a person is indigent if the person has an
 14 19 income level at or below 125 percent of the U.S. poverty level
 14 20 and the person is unable to pay for the cost of an ignition
 14 21 interlock device. A person is also indigent if the person has
 14 22 an income level greater than 125 percent, but at or below 200
 14 23 percent, of the U.S. poverty level and paying for the ignition
 14 24 interlock device would cause the person substantial hardship.
 14 25    The bill provides for county sobriety monitoring pilot
 14 26 programs. The bill allows the department of public health
 14 27 (DPH), in collaboration with the department of corrections,
 14 28 the department of public safety, and the DOT, to approve
 14 29 applications from counties for countywide sobriety monitoring
 14 30 pilot programs. The programs are to be available 24 hours per
 14 31 day, seven days per week, in an effort to reduce the number
 14 32 of crimes related to OWI.  One application shall be approved
 14 33 for a county with a population of 200,000 people or more, one
 14 34 application shall be approved for a county with a population of
 14 35 100,000 people or more but less than 200,000 people, and one
 15  1 application shall be approved for a county with a population of
 15  2 less than 100,000 people.
 15  3    The programs shall require individuals charged with or
 15  4 convicted of OWI to abstain from all chemical substances for
 15  5 a period of time. The programs are to require testing to
 15  6 determine whether a chemical substance is present at least
 15  7 twice per day at a central location where an immediate sanction
 15  8 can be applied or, where such testing is impractical, by
 15  9 continuous transdermal or electronic monitoring. The programs
 15 10 shall also apply sanctions when test results definitively
 15 11 indicate the presence of a chemical substance. The programs
 15 12 shall require participants to pay program costs and to install
 15 13 an ignition interlock device.
 15 14    A court in a county that has established a pilot program
 15 15 may order a defendant, as a condition of pretrial release,
 15 16 probation, or bond, to participate in the program. Approved
 15 17 pilot programs shall begin January 15, 2017, or upon the
 15 18 effective date of DPH rules, whichever is earlier, and shall
 15 19 be conducted for a minimum of one year. The DPH is to adopt
 15 20 rules to implement the programs, including but not limited to
 15 21 provisions relating to applications for, approval of, costs of,
 15 22 and oversight of the pilot programs and reporting requirements
 15 23 for participating counties. The DPH is directed to submit
 15 24 a report on the results of the pilot programs and make
 15 25 recommendations to the general assembly by December 15, 2018.

 13 17    Under current law, an ignition interlock device is required
 13 18 to be installed in a person's vehicle for the period of time
 13 19 for which the person's temporary restricted license is issued,
 13 20 and up to one additional year after license reinstatement if
 13 21 the person has two or more OWI revocations. The bill requires
 13 22 the permanent installation of an ignition interlock device with
 13 23 two exceptions. If the ignition interlock device was installed
 13 24 as a result of the person's first OWI offense or revocation and
 13 25 a test was obtained, the device shall be uninstalled 180 days
 13 26 after the person's license was revoked, the person last failed
 13 27 a test by the ignition interlock device, or the defendant last
 13 28 failed to maintain the device as required, whichever is latest.
 13 29 If the ignition interlock device was installed as a result of
 13 30 the person's first OWI offense or revocation and a test was
 13 31 refused, the device shall be uninstalled 180 days after the
 13 32 person's license revocation period is over, the person last
 13 33 failed a test by the ignition interlock device, or the person
 13 34 last failed to maintain the device as required, whichever is
 13 35 latest.
 14  1 The bill provides an ignition interlock device shall not
 14  2 be uninstalled if the person has been convicted of a second
 14  3 or subsequent OWI violation, if the person's license has been
 14  4 revoked for a second or subsequent time, or if the person has
 14  5 been convicted of tampering with or circumventing an ignition
 14  6 interlock device.
 14  7    The bill requires the department of transportation (DOT)
 14  8 to assess a monthly ignition interlock user fee to each user
 14  9 of an ignition interlock device. All ignition interlock user
 14 10 fees will be collected by the DOT and deposited in an ignition
 14 11 interlock indigent user fund (IIIUF). The bill requires the
 14 12 DOT to use the moneys in the IIIUF to assist indigent users
 14 13 of ignition interlock devices in paying for the use of the
 14 14 devices. The amount of the monthly ignition interlock user fee
 14 15 shall be set by the DOT so that the moneys in the IIIUF are
 14 16 sufficient to assist all indigent users of ignition interlock
 14 17 devices in paying for the use of the devices.
 14 18    Under the bill, a person is indigent if the person has an
 14 19 income level at or below 125 percent of the U.S. poverty level
 14 20 and the person is unable to pay for the cost of an ignition
 14 21 interlock device. A person is also indigent if the person has
 14 22 an income level greater than 125 percent, but at or below 200
 14 23 percent, of the U.S. poverty level and paying for the ignition
 14 24 interlock device would cause the person substantial hardship.

 14 29 applications from counties for countywide sobriety monitoring
 14 30 pilot programs. The programs are to be available 24 hours per
 14 31 day, seven days per week, in an effort to reduce the number
 14 32 of crimes related to OWI.  One application shall be approved
 14 33 for a county with a population of 200,000 people or more, one
 14 34 application shall be approved for a county with a population of
 14 35 100,000 people or more but less than 200,000 people, and one
 15  1 application shall be approved for a county with a population of
 15  2 less than 100,000 people.
 15  3    The programs shall require individuals charged with or
 15  4 convicted of OWI to abstain from all chemical substances for
 15  5 a period of time. The programs are to require testing to
 15  6 determine whether a chemical substance is present at least
 15  7 twice per day at a central location where an immediate sanction
 15  8 can be applied or, where such testing is impractical, by
 15  9 continuous transdermal or electronic monitoring. The programs

 15 14    A court in a county that has established a pilot program
 15 15 may order a defendant, as a condition of pretrial release,
 15 16 probation, or bond, to participate in the program. Approved
 15 17 pilot programs shall begin January 15, 2017, or upon the

 15  3    The programs shall require individuals charged with or
 15  4 convicted of OWI to abstain from all chemical substances for
 15  5 a period of time. The programs are to require testing to
 15  6 determine whether a chemical substance is present at least

 14  8 to assess a monthly ignition interlock user fee to each user
 14  9 of an ignition interlock device. All ignition interlock user
 14 10 fees will be collected by the DOT and deposited in an ignition
 14 11 interlock indigent user fund (IIIUF). The bill requires the
 14 12 DOT to use the moneys in the IIIUF to assist indigent users
 14 13 of ignition interlock devices in paying for the use of the
 14 14 devices. The amount of the monthly ignition interlock user fee
 14 15 shall be set by the DOT so that the moneys in the IIIUF are
 14 16 sufficient to assist all indigent users of ignition interlock
 14 17 devices in paying for the use of the devices.
 14 18    Under the bill, a person is indigent if the person has an
 14 19 income level at or below 125 percent of the U.S. poverty level
 14 20 and the person is unable to pay for the cost of an ignition
 14 21 interlock device. A person is also indigent if the person has
 14 22 an income level greater than 125 percent, but at or below 200
 14 23 percent, of the U.S. poverty level and paying for the ignition
 14 24 interlock device would cause the person substantial hardship.
 14 25    The bill provides for county sobriety monitoring pilot
 14 26 programs. The bill allows the department of public health
 14 27 (DPH), in collaboration with the department of corrections,
 14 28 the department of public safety, and the DOT, to approve
 14 29 applications from counties for countywide sobriety monitoring
 14 30 pilot programs. The programs are to be available 24 hours per
 14 31 day, seven days per week, in an effort to reduce the number
 14 32 of crimes related to OWI.  One application shall be approved
 14 33 for a county with a population of 200,000 people or more, one
 14 34 application shall be approved for a county with a population of
 14 35 100,000 people or more but less than 200,000 people, and one
 15  1 application shall be approved for a county with a population of
 15  2 less than 100,000 people.
 15  3    The programs shall require individuals charged with or
 15  4 convicted of OWI to abstain from all chemical substances for
 15  5 a period of time. The programs are to require testing to
 15  6 determine whether a chemical substance is present at least
 15  7 twice per day at a central location where an immediate sanction
 15  8 can be applied or, where such testing is impractical, by
 15  9 continuous transdermal or electronic monitoring. The programs
 15 10 shall also apply sanctions when test results definitively
 15 11 indicate the presence of a chemical substance. The programs
 15 12 shall require participants to pay program costs and to install
 15 13 an ignition interlock device.
 15 14    A court in a county that has established a pilot program
 15 15 may order a defendant, as a condition of pretrial release,
 15 16 probation, or bond, to participate in the program. Approved
 15 17 pilot programs shall begin January 15, 2017, or upon the
 15 18 effective date of DPH rules, whichever is earlier, and shall
 15 19 be conducted for a minimum of one year. The DPH is to adopt
 15 20 rules to implement the programs, including but not limited to
 15 21 provisions relating to applications for, approval of, costs of,
 15 22 and oversight of the pilot programs and reporting requirements
 15 23 for participating counties. The DPH is directed to submit
 15 24 a report on the results of the pilot programs and make

 14  3 or subsequent OWI violation, if the person's license has been
 14  4 revoked for a second or subsequent time, or if the person has
 14  5 been convicted of tampering with or circumventing an ignition
 14  6 interlock device.
 14  7    The bill requires the department of transportation (DOT)
 14  8 to assess a monthly ignition interlock user fee to each user
 14  9 of an ignition interlock device. All ignition interlock user
 14 10 fees will be collected by the DOT and deposited in an ignition
 14 11 interlock indigent user fund (IIIUF). The bill requires the
 14 12 DOT to use the moneys in the IIIUF to assist indigent users
 14 13 of ignition interlock devices in paying for the use of the
 14 14 devices. The amount of the monthly ignition interlock user fee
 14 15 shall be set by the DOT so that the moneys in the IIIUF are
 14 16 sufficient to assist all indigent users of ignition interlock
 14 17 devices in paying for the use of the devices.
 14 18    Under the bill, a person is indigent if the person has an
 14 19 income level at or below 125 percent of the U.S. poverty level
 14 20 and the person is unable to pay for the cost of an ignition
 14 21 interlock device. A person is also indigent if the person has
 14 22 an income level greater than 125 percent, but at or below 200
 14 23 percent, of the U.S. poverty level and paying for the ignition
 14 24 interlock device would cause the person substantial hardship.
 14 25    The bill provides for county sobriety monitoring pilot
 14 26 programs. The bill allows the department of public health
 14 27 (DPH), in collaboration with the department of corrections,
 14 28 the department of public safety, and the DOT, to approve
 14 29 applications from counties for countywide sobriety monitoring
 14 30 pilot programs. The programs are to be available 24 hours per
 14 31 day, seven days per week, in an effort to reduce the number
 14 32 of crimes related to OWI.  One application shall be approved
 14 33 for a county with a population of 200,000 people or more, one
 14 34 application shall be approved for a county with a population of
 14 35 100,000 people or more but less than 200,000 people, and one
 15  1 application shall be approved for a county with a population of
 15  2 less than 100,000 people.
 15  3    The programs shall require individuals charged with or
 15  4 convicted of OWI to abstain from all chemical substances for
 15  5 a period of time. The programs are to require testing to
 15  6 determine whether a chemical substance is present at least
 15  7 twice per day at a central location where an immediate sanction
 15  8 can be applied or, where such testing is impractical, by
 15  9 continuous transdermal or electronic monitoring. The programs
 15 10 shall also apply sanctions when test results definitively
 15 11 indicate the presence of a chemical substance. The programs
 15 12 shall require participants to pay program costs and to install
 15 13 an ignition interlock device.
 15 14    A court in a county that has established a pilot program
 15 15 may order a defendant, as a condition of pretrial release,
 15 16 probation, or bond, to participate in the program. Approved
 15 17 pilot programs shall begin January 15, 2017, or upon the
 15 18 effective date of DPH rules, whichever is earlier, and shall
 15 19 be conducted for a minimum of one year. The DPH is to adopt
 15 20 rules to implement the programs, including but not limited to
 15 21 provisions relating to applications for, approval of, costs of,
 15 22 and oversight of the pilot programs and reporting requirements
 15 23 for participating counties. The DPH is directed to submit
 15 24 a report on the results of the pilot programs and make
 15 25 recommendations to the general assembly by December 15, 2018.
