  7 21                           EXPLANATION
  7 22 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  7 23 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  7 24    This bill creates an electric or natural gas vehicle
  7 25 facility tax credit for persons who purchase and install an
  7 26 electric vehicle facility or a natural gas vehicle facility.
  7 27 The amount of the tax credit is 30 percent of the cost of
  7 28 purchasing and 30 percent of the cost of installing the
  7 29 facility. A person may claim the tax credit on an agricultural
  7 30 (farmer), commercial (business), or residential (personal,
  7 31 family, or household) basis. The bill provides that $5 million
  7 32 is dedicated for the issuance of tax credit certificates
  7 33 which must be attached to a person's tax return in order to
  7 34 claim the tax credit. A person claiming the tax credit on
  7 35 an agricultural or commercial basis may claim the tax credit
  8  1 for an electric or natural gas facility. The person must
  8  2 claim one=third of the tax credit for each of three tax years
  8  3 beginning in the tax year that the facility was placed in
  8  4 service. A person claiming the tax credit on a residential
  8  5 basis may claim the tax credit for only the electric vehicle
  8  6 facility. The person must claim the tax credit in the tax year
  8  7 in which the electric vehicle facility was placed in service.
  8  8 Any tax credit in excess of the taxpayer's tax liability is
  8  9 refundable or may be credited to the tax liability for the
  8 10 following tax year.
  8 11    The taxpayer must place the facility in service before
  8 12 January 1, 2018, but those taxpayers claiming on an
  8 13 agricultural or commercial basis may continue to claim the tax
  8 14 credit after that date for purposes of meeting the requirement
  8 15 that one=third of the credit be taken each year for three years
  8 16 and the authorization to carry forward the excess for one year.
  8 17    The aggregate amount of electric or natural gas vehicle
  8 18 facility tax credit certificates that may be issued cannot
  8 19 exceed $5 million for all tax years that the tax credit is
  8 20 available. Two million dollars is allocated to electric
  8 21 vehicle facilities, $2 million is allocated to natural gas
  8 22 facilities, and $1 million is allocated to either electric
  8 23 vehicle facilities or natural gas vehicle facilities. As of
  8 24 July 1, 2017, any remaining unobligated or unexpended moneys
  8 25 are allocated to either type of facility.
  8 26    The tax credit applies retroactively to tax years beginning
  8 27 on and after January 1, 2015. The bill's provisions are
  8 28 repealed on January 1, 2023. The bill takes effect upon
  8 29 enactment.

  7 22 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  7 23 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  7 24    This bill creates an electric or natural gas vehicle
  7 25 facility tax credit for persons who purchase and install an

  7 27 The amount of the tax credit is 30 percent of the cost of

  7 32 is dedicated for the issuance of tax credit certificates
  7 33 which must be attached to a person's tax return in order to

  8  8 Any tax credit in excess of the taxpayer's tax liability is

  8 10 following tax year.
  8 11    The taxpayer must place the facility in service before

  8 13 agricultural or commercial basis may continue to claim the tax
  8 14 credit after that date for purposes of meeting the requirement
  8 15 that one=third of the credit be taken each year for three years
  8 16 and the authorization to carry forward the excess for one year.
