  5 16 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  5 17 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  5 18    This bill modifies the rebate of state sales tax to the owner
  5 19 or operator of a baseball and softball tournament facility and
  5 20 movie site.
  5 21    BACKGROUND.  2012 Iowa Acts, chapter 1098, enacted a sales
  5 22 tax rebate to the owner or operator of a baseball and softball
  5 23 tournament facility and movie site (facility).  In order to
  5 24 be eligible for the rebate, the facility must be located on a
  5 25 maximum of 279 acres and located inside or within three miles
  5 26 of the city limits of a city with a population between 4,000
  5 27 and 5,500, which is located in a county with a population
  5 28 between 93,000 and 100,000.  Construction on the facility
  5 29 must commence not later than July 1, 2013, and the cost of
  5 30 construction must be at least $38 million.
  5 31    The rebate only applies to state sales tax collected at
  5 32 the facility between January 1, 2014, and December 31, 2023.
  5 33 The rebate ceases if control of the facility changes.  The
  5 34 rebate provision is repealed June 30, 2024, or 30 days after a
  5 35 total of $16.5 million has been rebated, or 30 days following
  6  1 the change of control causing the rebates to cease, whichever
  6  2 occurs earlier.
  6  3    CHANGES IN BILL.  The bill changes the name of the qualifying
  6  4 "baseball and softball tournament facility and movie site"
  6  5 to a "baseball and softball complex" (complex) and changes
  6  6 the requirements to qualify for the rebate.  A complex will
  6  7 qualify for the rebate if it is located in this state, has
  6  8 a project completion date that is after July 1, 2016, and
  6  9 has construction costs of at least $10 million.  "Project
  6 10 completion date" is defined in the bill to mean the date on
  6 11 which the complex is placed into service.
  6 12    The bill removes the requirement that the legal entity
  6 13 that is the owner or operator of the complex be a for=profit
  6 14 legal entity, and further modifies the percentage=of=ownership
  6 15 requirements for qualification as an owner or operator and
  6 16 for the occurrence of a change of control to specify that the
  6 17 percentage is calculated using the equity interests or voting
  6 18 interest owned or controlled by Iowa residents.  Under current
  6 19 law, the calculation only considers equity interests owned by
  6 20 Iowa residents.
  6 21    The bill changes the availability of the rebate for each
  6 22 complex to specify that the rebate only applies to sales tax
  6 23 collected for the 10=year period beginning on or after the
  6 24 complex's project completion date.
  6 25    The bill specifies that any one complex cannot receive more
  6 26 than $2.5 million in total rebates.  The bill changes the
  6 27 repeal date of the rebate provision to provide that the rebate
  6 28 is repealed 30 days after a total of $16.5 million has been
  6 29 rebated.
