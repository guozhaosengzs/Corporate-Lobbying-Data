 26 19 if section 708.6 or 708.8 applies.
 26 20    d.  An aggravated misdemeanor, if the dating abuse assault
 26 21 is committed by knowingly impeding the normal breathing or

 26 25    3.  Except as otherwise provided in subsection 2, on a second

 28  4 to chapter 902 or 903, and does not prohibit the court from
 28  5 entering a deferred judgment or sentence pursuant to section
 28  6 907.3, if the person has not previously received a deferred

 28 31 imposed by subsection 7, paragraph "a", the court shall order
 28 32 a person convicted under subsection 2 or 3 to participate

 26 19 if section 708.6 or 708.8 applies.

 26 21 is committed by knowingly impeding the normal breathing or

 26 25    3.  Except as otherwise provided in subsection 2, on a second
 26 26 dating abuse assault, a person commits:
 26 27    a.  A serious misdemeanor, if the first offense was

 27  8 felony.
 27  9    6.  a.  A conviction for, deferred judgment for, or plea of
 27 10 guilty to, a violation of this section which occurred more than
 27 11 twelve years prior to the date of the violation charged shall
 27 12 not be considered in determining that the violation charged is
 27 13 a second or subsequent offense.
 27 14    b.  For the purpose of determining if a violation charged
 27 15 is a second or subsequent offense, deferred judgments issued
 27 16 pursuant to section 907.3 for violations of section 708.2 or

 27 18 and convictions or the equivalent of deferred judgments for
 27 19 violations in any other states under statutes substantially

 27 21 offenses. The courts shall judicially notice the statutes of
 27 22 other states which define offenses substantially equivalent
 27 23 to the offenses defined in this section and can therefore be
 27 24 considered corresponding statutes. Each previous violation on

 28  2 from sentencing and the person from serving the maximum term of
 28  3 confinement or from paying the maximum fine permitted pursuant
 28  4 to chapter 902 or 903, and does not prohibit the court from
 28  5 entering a deferred judgment or sentence pursuant to section
 28  6 907.3, if the person has not previously received a deferred
 28  7 sentence or judgment for a violation of section 708.2 or this

 27 18 and convictions or the equivalent of deferred judgments for

 28  2 from sentencing and the person from serving the maximum term of
 28  3 confinement or from paying the maximum fine permitted pursuant

 28  6 907.3, if the person has not previously received a deferred
 28  7 sentence or judgment for a violation of section 708.2 or this

 28 13 sentence. Notwithstanding section 901.5, subsections 1, 3, and
 28 14 5, and section 907.3, the person cannot receive a suspended or
 28 15 deferred sentence or a deferred judgment; however, the person

 28 31 imposed by subsection 7, paragraph "a", the court shall order
 28 32 a person convicted under subsection 2 or 3 to participate
 28 33 in a batterers' treatment program as required under section
 28 34 708.2B.  In addition, as a condition of deferring judgment or

 28 31 imposed by subsection 7, paragraph "a", the court shall order
 28 32 a person convicted under subsection 2 or 3 to participate

 32  2 and provides penalties.
 32  3    The bill creates new Code chapter 236A, the dating abuse
 32  4 Act, allowing a victim of dating abuse to seek relief from
 32  5 dating abuse by filing a petition in district court for a

 32 25 costs.
 32 26    The bill requires criminal or juvenile justice agencies to

 32 28 abuse and to provide the information to the department of
 32 29 public safety. The bill provides certain provisions relating
 32 30 to the confidentiality of dating abuse victim records, the
 32 31 duties of a peace officer in dating abuse cases, and the duties
 32 32 of the department of justice relating to dating abuse training,
 32 33 services, and funding.
 32 34    The bill makes conforming changes to Code provisions,
 32 35 including those relating to the address confidentiality

 33  2 orders, the duties of the departments of justice, public

 33  6 termination of parental rights proceedings, court and jail
 33  7 operating costs, peace officer arrests, and certain sentencing
 33  8 and victim rights and services provisions.
 33  9    The bill creates the criminal offense of dating abuse
 33 10 assault and provides penalties, including mandatory
 33 11 minimum fines and penalties, and fines, ranging from a
 33 12 simple misdemeanor to a class "D" felony, depending on the
 33 13 circumstances of the offense. The bill requires the court
 33 14 to order a defendant convicted of dating abuse assault to
 33 15 participate in a batterers' treatment program. A person
 33 16 arrested for a dating abuse assault is subject to a no=contact
