  6 35                           EXPLANATION
  7  1 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  7  2 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  7  3    This bill provides education savings grants for certain
  7  4 pupils attending a nonpublic school and establishes an
  7  5 education savings grant fund.
  7  6    Under the bill, for school budget years beginning on or after
  7  7 July 1, 2017, the following pupils are eligible to receive
  7  8 an education savings grant: (1) not more than 120 pupils
  7  9 who are eligible to enroll in kindergarten through grade 12
  7 10 in the Waterloo community school district, who are eligible
  7 11 for free and reduced price meals under federal law, and who
  7 12 are attending a nonpublic school during the applicable school
  7 13 budget year, and (2) not more than 70 pupils who are eligible
  7 14 to enroll in kindergarten through grade 12 in the Sioux Center
  7 15 community school district, who are eligible for free and
  7 16 reduced price meals under federal law, and who are attending a
  7 17 nonpublic school during the applicable school budget year. By
  7 18 January 31 preceding the school year for which the education
  7 19 savings grant is requested, the parent or guardian of the pupil
  7 20 requesting to receive an education savings grant must submit an
  7 21 application to the department of education indicating that the
  7 22 parent or guardian intends to enroll the pupil in a nonpublic
  7 23 school.
  7 24    The bill requires that by March 1 preceding the school
  7 25 year for which the education savings grant is requested,
  7 26 the department of education must notify the department of
  7 27 management of the number of pupils in each school district
  7 28 designated for the following school year to receive an
  7 29 education savings grant and the amount of the education savings
  7 30 grant for each pupil.  Education savings grants may only be
  7 31 approved for one school year per application, and applications
  7 32 must be submitted for education savings grants in subsequent
  7 33 school years. Applications for education savings grants are
  7 34 approved in the order in which they are filed. However, in
  7 35 order to provide continuity of education for pupils receiving
  8  1 education savings grants, the department shall give priority
  8  2 to applications submitted for pupils who received an education
  8  3 savings grant during the previous school year.
  8  4    The amount of each education savings grant is equal to
  8  5 $5,854.
  8  6    The bill creates an education savings grant fund in the state
  8  7 treasury under the control of the department of management
  8  8 consisting of moneys appropriated to the department for the
  8  9 purpose of providing education savings grants.  For the fiscal
  8 10 year commencing July 1, 2017, and each succeeding fiscal year,
  8 11 there is appropriated from the general fund of the state to the
  8 12 department of management for deposit in the fund the amount
  8 13 necessary to pay all education savings grants approved for
  8 14 that fiscal year.  For each pupil approved for an education
  8 15 savings grant, the department of management must establish an
  8 16 account for that pupil in the education savings grant fund.
  8 17 The amount of the pupil's education savings grant is deposited
  8 18 into the pupil's account on July 1 and such amount is available
  8 19 for use by parents and guardians for the payment of qualified
  8 20 educational expenses, as defined in the bill, incurred by the
  8 21 parent or guardian for the pupil during that fiscal year.
  8 22    The bill defines "nonpublic school" to mean those nonpublic
  8 23 schools accredited by the department of education and nonpublic
  8 24 institutions which comply with state board of education
  8 25 standards for providing special education programs.
  8 26    The bill authorizes the department of education to
  8 27 contract with a private financial management firm to manage
  8 28 the education savings grant fund, in collaboration with the
  8 29 treasurer of state, including providing for the disbursement
  8 30 of education savings grants in the form of an electronic debit
  8 31 card or checks that are payable directly from the pupil's
  8 32 account within the fund.
  8 33    The bill provides that moneys remaining in a pupil's account
  8 34 upon the conclusion of the fiscal year shall remain in the
  8 35 pupil's account within the education savings grant fund for
  9  1 the payment of qualified educational expenses in future fiscal
  9  2 years.
  9  3    Under the bill, unless a pupil graduates from high school
  9  4 and a request for an extension of a pupil's account for the
  9  5 payment of higher education expenses is filed, for each pupil
  9  6 with a positive balance in the pupil's account in the education
  9  7 savings grant fund upon graduation from high school or upon
  9  8 termination of the pupil's enrollment in the nonpublic school,
  9  9 moneys in the pupil's account are transferred by the department
  9 10 of management for deposit in the general fund of the state.
  9 11    Under the bill, for each pupil with a positive balance in
  9 12 the pupil's account in the education savings grant fund upon
  9 13 graduation from high school, the department of management is
  9 14 required to maintain the account in the fund until the pupil
  9 15 is 25 years old if the pupil has filed a request with the
  9 16 department by June 30 following graduation from high school
  9 17 for an extension of the account for the payment of higher
  9 18 education expenses.  Following graduation from high school
  9 19 until the pupil is 25 years old, moneys in the pupil's account
  9 20 may be used by the pupil for higher education costs, as defined
  9 21 in Code section 12D.1.  Moneys in a pupil's account when the
  9 22 pupil turns 25 years old are transferred by the department of
  9 23 management for deposit in the general fund of the state.
  9 24    The bill provides that a person who makes a false claim for
  9 25 the purpose of obtaining an education savings grant or who
  9 26 knowingly receives the grant or makes a payment from an account
  9 27 within the education savings grant fund without being legally
  9 28 entitled to it is guilty of a fraudulent practice and is
  9 29 subject to a criminal penalty.  The bill allows the department
  9 30 of management to initiate legal proceedings to recover grants
  9 31 and amounts improperly awarded or paid from accounts under the
  9 32 bill.
  9 33    The education savings grant program is subject to
  9 34 legislative review at least every five years. The review
  9 35 shall be based upon an education savings grant status report
 10  1 containing the recommendations of a legislative interim
 10  2 committee. The first such report shall be submitted to the
 10  3 general assembly no later than January 1, 2022, with subsequent
 10  4 reports developed and submitted by January 1 at least every
 10  5 fifth year thereafter.
 10  6    The bill provides that moneys from an education savings
 10  7 grant under the bill are not taxable income under Code chapter
 10  8 422.
 10  9    Under the bill, resident pupils attending an accredited
 10 10 nonpublic school while receiving an education savings grant
 10 11 under the bill are required to be counted as full=time pupils
 10 12 for enrollment purposes in the public school district of
 10 13 residence.
 10 14    The bill applies to school budget years and fiscal years
 10 15 beginning on or after July 1, 2017.
 10 16    The provision of the bill amending Code section 422.7
 10 17 applies to tax years beginning on or after January 1, 2017.

  7  3    This bill provides education savings grants for certain
  7  4 pupils attending a nonpublic school and establishes an

  8 17 The amount of the pupil's education savings grant is deposited
  8 18 into the pupil's account on July 1 and such amount is available
  8 19 for use by parents and guardians for the payment of qualified
  8 20 educational expenses, as defined in the bill, incurred by the
  8 21 parent or guardian for the pupil during that fiscal year.

  9  4 and a request for an extension of a pupil's account for the
  9  5 payment of higher education expenses is filed, for each pupil
  9  6 with a positive balance in the pupil's account in the education
  9  7 savings grant fund upon graduation from high school or upon
  9  8 termination of the pupil's enrollment in the nonpublic school,
  9  9 moneys in the pupil's account are transferred by the department
  9 10 of management for deposit in the general fund of the state.
  9 11    Under the bill, for each pupil with a positive balance in
  9 12 the pupil's account in the education savings grant fund upon
  9 13 graduation from high school, the department of management is
  9 14 required to maintain the account in the fund until the pupil
  9 15 is 25 years old if the pupil has filed a request with the
  9 16 department by June 30 following graduation from high school
  9 17 for an extension of the account for the payment of higher
  9 18 education expenses.  Following graduation from high school
  9 19 until the pupil is 25 years old, moneys in the pupil's account
  9 20 may be used by the pupil for higher education costs, as defined
  9 21 in Code section 12D.1.  Moneys in a pupil's account when the
  9 22 pupil turns 25 years old are transferred by the department of
  9 23 management for deposit in the general fund of the state.
  9 24    The bill provides that a person who makes a false claim for
  9 25 the purpose of obtaining an education savings grant or who
  9 26 knowingly receives the grant or makes a payment from an account
  9 27 within the education savings grant fund without being legally
  9 28 entitled to it is guilty of a fraudulent practice and is

  7  3    This bill provides education savings grants for certain
  7  4 pupils attending a nonpublic school and establishes an
  7  5 education savings grant fund.
  7  6    Under the bill, for school budget years beginning on or after
  7  7 July 1, 2017, the following pupils are eligible to receive
  7  8 an education savings grant: (1) not more than 120 pupils
  7  9 who are eligible to enroll in kindergarten through grade 12

  7 19 savings grant is requested, the parent or guardian of the pupil
  7 20 requesting to receive an education savings grant must submit an
  7 21 application to the department of education indicating that the
  7 22 parent or guardian intends to enroll the pupil in a nonpublic

  7 30 grant for each pupil.  Education savings grants may only be
  7 31 approved for one school year per application, and applications
  7 32 must be submitted for education savings grants in subsequent

  8  2 to applications submitted for pupils who received an education
  8  3 savings grant during the previous school year.
  8  4    The amount of each education savings grant is equal to

  8 15 savings grant, the department of management must establish an
  8 16 account for that pupil in the education savings grant fund.
  8 17 The amount of the pupil's education savings grant is deposited
  8 18 into the pupil's account on July 1 and such amount is available
  8 19 for use by parents and guardians for the payment of qualified
  8 20 educational expenses, as defined in the bill, incurred by the
  8 21 parent or guardian for the pupil during that fiscal year.
  8 22    The bill defines "nonpublic school" to mean those nonpublic
  8 23 schools accredited by the department of education and nonpublic

  9  2 years.

  9  4 and a request for an extension of a pupil's account for the
  9  5 payment of higher education expenses is filed, for each pupil
  9  6 with a positive balance in the pupil's account in the education
  9  7 savings grant fund upon graduation from high school or upon
  9  8 termination of the pupil's enrollment in the nonpublic school,
  9  9 moneys in the pupil's account are transferred by the department
  9 10 of management for deposit in the general fund of the state.
  9 11    Under the bill, for each pupil with a positive balance in
  9 12 the pupil's account in the education savings grant fund upon
  9 13 graduation from high school, the department of management is
  9 14 required to maintain the account in the fund until the pupil

  7  3    This bill provides education savings grants for certain

  7 20 requesting to receive an education savings grant must submit an
  7 21 application to the department of education indicating that the
  7 22 parent or guardian intends to enroll the pupil in a nonpublic
  7 23 school.
  7 24    The bill requires that by March 1 preceding the school
  7 25 year for which the education savings grant is requested,
  7 26 the department of education must notify the department of
  7 27 management of the number of pupils in each school district
  7 28 designated for the following school year to receive an

  7 30 grant for each pupil.  Education savings grants may only be

  8  4    The amount of each education savings grant is equal to
  8  5 $5,854.
  8  6    The bill creates an education savings grant fund in the state

  8 12 department of management for deposit in the fund the amount
  8 13 necessary to pay all education savings grants approved for
  8 14 that fiscal year.  For each pupil approved for an education
  8 15 savings grant, the department of management must establish an
  8 16 account for that pupil in the education savings grant fund.
  8 17 The amount of the pupil's education savings grant is deposited
  8 18 into the pupil's account on July 1 and such amount is available
  8 19 for use by parents and guardians for the payment of qualified
  8 20 educational expenses, as defined in the bill, incurred by the

  8 23 schools accredited by the department of education and nonpublic
  8 24 institutions which comply with state board of education
  8 25 standards for providing special education programs.
  8 26    The bill authorizes the department of education to
  8 27 contract with a private financial management firm to manage
  8 28 the education savings grant fund, in collaboration with the
  8 29 treasurer of state, including providing for the disbursement
  8 30 of education savings grants in the form of an electronic debit
  8 31 card or checks that are payable directly from the pupil's
  8 32 account within the fund.
  8 33    The bill provides that moneys remaining in a pupil's account
  8 34 upon the conclusion of the fiscal year shall remain in the
  8 35 pupil's account within the education savings grant fund for
  9  1 the payment of qualified educational expenses in future fiscal
  9  2 years.
  9  3    Under the bill, unless a pupil graduates from high school
  9  4 and a request for an extension of a pupil's account for the
  9  5 payment of higher education expenses is filed, for each pupil
  9  6 with a positive balance in the pupil's account in the education
  9  7 savings grant fund upon graduation from high school or upon
  9  8 termination of the pupil's enrollment in the nonpublic school,
  9  9 moneys in the pupil's account are transferred by the department
  9 10 of management for deposit in the general fund of the state.
  9 11    Under the bill, for each pupil with a positive balance in
  9 12 the pupil's account in the education savings grant fund upon
  9 13 graduation from high school, the department of management is
  9 14 required to maintain the account in the fund until the pupil
  9 15 is 25 years old if the pupil has filed a request with the
  9 16 department by June 30 following graduation from high school
  9 17 for an extension of the account for the payment of higher
  9 18 education expenses.  Following graduation from high school
  9 19 until the pupil is 25 years old, moneys in the pupil's account
  9 20 may be used by the pupil for higher education costs, as defined
  9 21 in Code section 12D.1.  Moneys in a pupil's account when the
  9 22 pupil turns 25 years old are transferred by the department of
  9 23 management for deposit in the general fund of the state.
  9 24    The bill provides that a person who makes a false claim for
  9 25 the purpose of obtaining an education savings grant or who
  9 26 knowingly receives the grant or makes a payment from an account
  9 27 within the education savings grant fund without being legally
  9 28 entitled to it is guilty of a fraudulent practice and is
  9 29 subject to a criminal penalty.  The bill allows the department
  9 30 of management to initiate legal proceedings to recover grants
  9 31 and amounts improperly awarded or paid from accounts under the
  9 32 bill.
  9 33    The education savings grant program is subject to

  7  1 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  7  2 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  7  3    This bill provides education savings grants for certain
  7  4 pupils attending a nonpublic school and establishes an
  7  5 education savings grant fund.
  7  6    Under the bill, for school budget years beginning on or after
  7  7 July 1, 2017, the following pupils are eligible to receive
  7  8 an education savings grant: (1) not more than 120 pupils
  7  9 who are eligible to enroll in kindergarten through grade 12
  7 10 in the Waterloo community school district, who are eligible
  7 11 for free and reduced price meals under federal law, and who
  7 12 are attending a nonpublic school during the applicable school
  7 13 budget year, and (2) not more than 70 pupils who are eligible
  7 14 to enroll in kindergarten through grade 12 in the Sioux Center
  7 15 community school district, who are eligible for free and
  7 16 reduced price meals under federal law, and who are attending a
  7 17 nonpublic school during the applicable school budget year. By
  7 18 January 31 preceding the school year for which the education
  7 19 savings grant is requested, the parent or guardian of the pupil
  7 20 requesting to receive an education savings grant must submit an
  7 21 application to the department of education indicating that the
  7 22 parent or guardian intends to enroll the pupil in a nonpublic
  7 23 school.
  7 24    The bill requires that by March 1 preceding the school
  7 25 year for which the education savings grant is requested,
  7 26 the department of education must notify the department of
  7 27 management of the number of pupils in each school district
  7 28 designated for the following school year to receive an
  7 29 education savings grant and the amount of the education savings
  7 30 grant for each pupil.  Education savings grants may only be
  7 31 approved for one school year per application, and applications
  7 32 must be submitted for education savings grants in subsequent
  7 33 school years. Applications for education savings grants are
  7 34 approved in the order in which they are filed. However, in
  7 35 order to provide continuity of education for pupils receiving
  8  1 education savings grants, the department shall give priority
  8  2 to applications submitted for pupils who received an education
  8  3 savings grant during the previous school year.
  8  4    The amount of each education savings grant is equal to
  8  5 $5,854.
  8  6    The bill creates an education savings grant fund in the state
  8  7 treasury under the control of the department of management
  8  8 consisting of moneys appropriated to the department for the
  8  9 purpose of providing education savings grants.  For the fiscal
  8 10 year commencing July 1, 2017, and each succeeding fiscal year,
  8 11 there is appropriated from the general fund of the state to the
  8 12 department of management for deposit in the fund the amount
  8 13 necessary to pay all education savings grants approved for
  8 14 that fiscal year.  For each pupil approved for an education
  8 15 savings grant, the department of management must establish an
  8 16 account for that pupil in the education savings grant fund.
  8 17 The amount of the pupil's education savings grant is deposited
  8 18 into the pupil's account on July 1 and such amount is available
  8 19 for use by parents and guardians for the payment of qualified
  8 20 educational expenses, as defined in the bill, incurred by the
  8 21 parent or guardian for the pupil during that fiscal year.
  8 22    The bill defines "nonpublic school" to mean those nonpublic
  8 23 schools accredited by the department of education and nonpublic
  8 24 institutions which comply with state board of education
  8 25 standards for providing special education programs.
  8 26    The bill authorizes the department of education to
  8 27 contract with a private financial management firm to manage
  8 28 the education savings grant fund, in collaboration with the
  8 29 treasurer of state, including providing for the disbursement
  8 30 of education savings grants in the form of an electronic debit
  8 31 card or checks that are payable directly from the pupil's
  8 32 account within the fund.
  8 33    The bill provides that moneys remaining in a pupil's account
  8 34 upon the conclusion of the fiscal year shall remain in the
  8 35 pupil's account within the education savings grant fund for
  9  1 the payment of qualified educational expenses in future fiscal
  9  2 years.
  9  3    Under the bill, unless a pupil graduates from high school
  9  4 and a request for an extension of a pupil's account for the
  9  5 payment of higher education expenses is filed, for each pupil
  9  6 with a positive balance in the pupil's account in the education
  9  7 savings grant fund upon graduation from high school or upon
  9  8 termination of the pupil's enrollment in the nonpublic school,
  9  9 moneys in the pupil's account are transferred by the department
  9 10 of management for deposit in the general fund of the state.
  9 11    Under the bill, for each pupil with a positive balance in
  9 12 the pupil's account in the education savings grant fund upon
  9 13 graduation from high school, the department of management is
  9 14 required to maintain the account in the fund until the pupil
  9 15 is 25 years old if the pupil has filed a request with the
  9 16 department by June 30 following graduation from high school
  9 17 for an extension of the account for the payment of higher
  9 18 education expenses.  Following graduation from high school
  9 19 until the pupil is 25 years old, moneys in the pupil's account
  9 20 may be used by the pupil for higher education costs, as defined
  9 21 in Code section 12D.1.  Moneys in a pupil's account when the
  9 22 pupil turns 25 years old are transferred by the department of
  9 23 management for deposit in the general fund of the state.
  9 24    The bill provides that a person who makes a false claim for
  9 25 the purpose of obtaining an education savings grant or who
  9 26 knowingly receives the grant or makes a payment from an account
  9 27 within the education savings grant fund without being legally
  9 28 entitled to it is guilty of a fraudulent practice and is
  9 29 subject to a criminal penalty.  The bill allows the department
  9 30 of management to initiate legal proceedings to recover grants
  9 31 and amounts improperly awarded or paid from accounts under the
  9 32 bill.
  9 33    The education savings grant program is subject to
  9 34 legislative review at least every five years. The review
  9 35 shall be based upon an education savings grant status report
 10  1 containing the recommendations of a legislative interim
 10  2 committee. The first such report shall be submitted to the
 10  3 general assembly no later than January 1, 2022, with subsequent
 10  4 reports developed and submitted by January 1 at least every
 10  5 fifth year thereafter.
 10  6    The bill provides that moneys from an education savings
 10  7 grant under the bill are not taxable income under Code chapter
 10  8 422.
 10  9    Under the bill, resident pupils attending an accredited
 10 10 nonpublic school while receiving an education savings grant
 10 11 under the bill are required to be counted as full=time pupils
 10 12 for enrollment purposes in the public school district of
