  3 20 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  3 21 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  3 22    This bill adds to the definition of "child abuse" under Code
  3 23 chapter 232 provisions relating to human trafficking, modifies
  3 24 related requirements for mandatory reporters of child abuse and
  3 25 mandatory reporter training, and makes penalties applicable.
  3 26    To the definition of "child abuse" or "abuse", the bill
  3 27 adds "the acts or omissions of a person responsible for the
  3 28 care of a child which allow, permit, encourage, or require the
  3 29 recruitment, harboring, transportation, provision, obtaining,
  3 30 patronizing, or soliciting of the child for the purpose of
  3 31 commercial sexual activity or forced labor or service" as
  3 32 defined in Code section 710A.1.
  3 33    Under Code section 710A.1, "forced labor or services" means
  3 34 labor or services that are performed or provided by another
  3 35 person and that are obtained or maintained through causing or
  4  1 threatening to cause serious physical injury to any person,
  4  2 physically restraining or threatening to physically restrain
  4  3 another person, abusing or threatening to abuse the law or
  4  4 legal process, or knowingly destroying, concealing, removing,
  4  5 confiscating, or possessing any actual or purported passport or
  4  6 other immigration document, or any other actual or purported
  4  7 government identification document, of another person.
  4  8 "Commercial sexual activity" means any sex act or sexually
  4  9 explicit performance for which anything of value is given,
  4 10 promised to, or received by any person and includes, but is not
  4 11 limited to, prostitution, participation in the production of
  4 12 pornography, and performance in strip clubs.
  4 13    With this change in the definition, the classes of persons
  4 14 required to make a report of child abuse must also make a
  4 15 report of suspected forced labor or services and suspected
  4 16 commercial sexual activity involving a child and complete
  4 17 training relating to the identification and reporting of such
  4 18 child abuse.
  4 19    The department of public health is directed to develop
  4 20 training standards on the subject of human trafficking
  4 21 involving children to include curricula on recognizing
  4 22 human trafficking victims, culturally sensitive and
  4 23 age=appropriate methods for approaching and dealing effectively
  4 24 and appropriately with trafficking victims and minors who
  4 25 are victims or who are impacted by human trafficking, and
  4 26 identifying the appropriate authorities to report potential
  4 27 cases of human trafficking.  The standards must be developed in
  4 28 cooperation with the crime victim assistance division of the
  4 29 department of justice, the Iowa law enforcement academy, the
  4 30 department of public safety, the attorney general's office, and
  4 31 any other federal, state, and local governmental agencies and
  4 32 nongovernmental or community organizations with expertise in
  4 33 human trafficking.
  4 34    The bill makes conforming changes, including provisions
  4 35 relating to commencing child abuse assessments, expunging data
  5  1 under certain conditions, and the procedures school districts
  5  2 and accredited nonpublic schools must use in handling child
  5  3 abuse reports.
  5  4    The civil and criminal sanctions of Code section 232.75
  5  5 apply to a person who fails to report a suspected case of
  5  6 child abuse or knowingly reports false information.  If the
  5  7 department of human services issues a finding that the alleged
  5  8 child abuse meets the definition of child abuse, the child
  5  9 abuse central registry provisions of Code chapters 232 and 235A
