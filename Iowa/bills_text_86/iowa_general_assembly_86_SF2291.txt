  5  8 internationally active insurance group, the commissioner may
  5  9 make a determination of or acknowledge a group=wide supervisor
  5 10 for such an insurance holding company system pursuant to this
  5 11 section.
  5 12    2.  a.  In cooperation with other state, federal, and
  5 13 international regulatory agencies, the commissioner shall
  5 14 identify a single group=wide supervisor for an internationally
  5 15 active insurance group.  The commissioner may determine that
  5 16 the commissioner is the appropriate group=wide supervisor
  5 17 for an internationally active insurance group that conducts
  5 18 substantial insurance operations concentrated in this state,
  5 19 or the commissioner may acknowledge that a regulatory official
  5 20 from another jurisdiction is the appropriate group=wide
  5 21 supervisor for the internationally active insurance group.  In
  5 22 making a determination or acknowledgment under this paragraph
  5 23 "a", the commissioner shall consider the following factors:
  5 24    (1)  The place of domicile of the insurers within the
  5 25 internationally active insurance group that hold the largest
  5 26 share of the group's written premiums, assets, or liabilities.
  5 27    (2)  The place of domicile of the top=tiered insurers in the
  5 28 insurance holding company system of the internationally active
  5 29 insurance group.
  5 30    (3)  The location of the executive offices or largest
  5 31 operational offices of the internationally active insurance
  5 32 group.
  5 33    (4)  Whether another regulatory official is acting as
  5 34 or is seeking to act as the group=wide supervisor of the
  5 35 internationally active insurance group under a regulatory
  6  1 system that the commissioner determines to be either of the
  6  2 following:
  6  3    (a)  Substantially similar to the system of regulation
  6  4 provided under the laws of this state.
  6  5    (b)  Otherwise sufficient in terms of providing for
  6  6 group=wide supervision, enterprise risk analysis, and
  6  7 cooperation with other regulatory officials.
  6  8    (5)  Whether another regulatory official acting as
  6  9 or seeking to act as the group=wide supervisor for the
  6 10 internationally active insurance group provides the
  6 11 commissioner with reasonably reciprocal recognition and
  6 12 cooperation.
  6 13    b.  Notwithstanding paragraph "a", even if the commissioner
  6 14 is identified pursuant to this subsection as the group=wide
  6 15 supervisor of an internationally active insurance group,
  6 16 the commissioner may determine that it is appropriate to
  6 17 acknowledge another regulatory official to serve as the
  6 18 group=wide supervisor of the internationally active insurance
  6 19 group.
  6 20    c.  The acknowledgment of a group=wide supervisor pursuant
  6 21 to this subsection shall be made after consideration of the
  6 22 factors listed in paragraph "a", subparagraphs (1) through
  6 23 (5), and shall be made in cooperation with and subject to the
  6 24 acknowledgment of other regulatory officials involved with
  6 25 supervision of members of the internationally active insurance
  6 26 group, and in consultation with the internationally active
  6 27 insurance group.
  6 28    3.  Notwithstanding any other provision of law, when another
  6 29 regulatory official is acting as the group=wide supervisor of
  6 30 an internationally active insurance group, the commissioner
  6 31 shall acknowledge that regulatory official as the group=wide
  6 32 supervisor of the internationally active insurance group.
  6 33 However, the commissioner shall make a new determination or
  6 34 acknowledgment as to the appropriate group=wide supervisor for
  6 35 the internationally active insurance group in the event that a
  7  1 material change in the internationally active insurance group
  7  2 results in either of the following:
  7  3    a.  The internationally active insurance group's insurers
  7  4 domiciled in Iowa holding the largest share of the group's
  7  5 premiums, assets, or liabilities.
  7  6    b.  Iowa being the place of domicile of the top=tiered
  7  7 insurers in the insurance holding company system of the
  7  8 internationally active insurance group.
  7  9    4.  Pursuant to section 521A.6, the commissioner is
  7 10 authorized to collect from any insurer registered pursuant to
  7 11 section 521A.4 all information necessary to determine whether
  7 12 it is appropriate for the commissioner to act as the group=wide
  7 13 supervisor of an internationally active insurance group or
  7 14 to acknowledge another regulatory official to act as the
  7 15 group=wide supervisor of the internationally active insurance
  7 16 group. Prior to issuing a determination or acknowledgment
  7 17 pursuant to this section, the commissioner shall notify the
  7 18 insurer registered pursuant to section 521A.4 and the ultimate
  7 19 controlling person within the internationally active insurance
  7 20 group of the pending determination or acknowledgment. The
  7 21 insurer and the internationally active insurance group shall
  7 22 have not less than thirty days to provide the commissioner with
  7 23 additional information pertinent to the commissioner's pending
  7 24 determination or acknowledgment. The commissioner shall
  7 25 publish the identity of the internationally active insurance
  7 26 groups that the commissioner has determined are subject to
  7 27 group=wide supervision by the commissioner.
  7 28    5.  If a determination is made that the commissioner is the
  7 29 appropriate group=wide supervisor for an internationally active
  7 30 insurance group, the commissioner is authorized to engage in
  7 31 any of the following group=wide supervision activities:
  7 32    a.  Assessing the enterprise risks within the internationally
  7 33 active insurance group to ensure all of the following:
  7 34    (1)  That the material financial condition and liquidity
  7 35 risks to members of the internationally active insurance group
  8  1 that are engaged in the business of insurance are identified
  8  2 by management.
  8  3    (2)  That reasonable and effective mitigation measures are
  8  4 in place.
  8  5    b.  Requesting, from any member of an internationally active
  8  6 insurance group subject to the commissioner's group=wide
  8  7 supervision, information necessary and appropriate to assess
  8  8 enterprise risk, including but not limited to information about
  8  9 the members of the internationally active insurance group
  8 10 regarding all of the following:
  8 11    (1)  Governance, risk assessment, and management.
  8 12    (2)  Capital adequacy.
  8 13    (3)  Material intercompany transactions.
  8 14    c.  Coordinating and, through the authority of the
  8 15 regulatory officials of the jurisdictions where members of
  8 16 the internationally active insurance group are domiciled,
  8 17 compelling the development and implementation of reasonable
  8 18 measures designed to ensure that the internationally active
  8 19 insurance group is able to timely recognize and mitigate
  8 20 enterprise risks to members of the internationally active
  8 21 insurance group that are engaged in the business of insurance.
  8 22    d.  Communicating with other state, federal, and
  8 23 international regulatory agencies for members within the
  8 24 internationally active insurance group and sharing relevant
  8 25 information, subject to the confidentiality provisions of
  8 26 section 521A.7, through supervisory colleges as set forth in
  8 27 section 521A.6A or otherwise.
  8 28    e.  Entering into agreements with or obtaining documentation
  8 29 from any insurer registered under section 521A.4, any member
  8 30 of an internationally active insurance group, and any other
  8 31 state, federal, or international regulatory agency for members
  8 32 of the internationally active insurance group, that provides
  8 33 the basis for or otherwise clarifies the commissioner's role as
  8 34 group=wide supervisor of an internationally active insurance
  8 35 group, including provisions for resolving disputes with other
  9  1 regulatory officials. Such agreements or documentation shall
  9  2 not serve as evidence in any proceeding that any insurer or
  9  3 person within an insurance company holding company system not
  9  4 domiciled or incorporated in this state is doing business in
  9  5 this state or is otherwise subject to jurisdiction in this
  9  6 state.
  9  7    f.  Other activities of group=wide supervision, consistent
  9  8 with the authority and purposes set forth in this section, as
  9  9 considered necessary by the commissioner.
  9 10    6.  If the commissioner acknowledges that another regulatory
  9 11 official from a jurisdiction that is not accredited by the
  9 12 national association of insurance commissioners is the
  9 13 group=wide supervisor of an internationally active insurance
  9 14 group, the commissioner may reasonably cooperate through a
  9 15 supervisory college or otherwise, with group=wide supervision
  9 16 undertaken by that regulatory official provided that all of the
  9 17 following occur:
  9 18    a.  The commissioner's cooperation is in compliance with the
  9 19 laws of this state.
  9 20    b.  The regulatory official acknowledged as the group=wide
  9 21 supervisor of the internationally active insurance group also
  9 22 recognizes and cooperates with the commissioner's activities
  9 23 as a group=wide supervisor for other internationally active
  9 24 insurance groups, where applicable.  If such recognition and
  9 25 cooperation is not reasonably reciprocal, the commissioner may
  9 26 refuse recognition and cooperation to that regulatory official.
  9 27    7.  The commissioner is authorized to enter into agreements
  9 28 with or obtain documentation from any insurer registered under
  9 29 section 521A.4, any affiliate of the insurer, and any other
  9 30 state, federal, or international regulatory agency for members
  9 31 of the internationally active insurance group, that provides
  9 32 the basis for or otherwise clarifies another regulatory
  9 33 official's role as group=wide supervisor of an internationally
  9 34 active insurance group.
  9 35    8.  An insurer registered under section 521A.4 that is
 10  1 subject to this section shall be liable for and shall pay the
 10  2 reasonable expenses of the commissioner's participation in
 10  3 the administration of this section, including the engagement
 10  4 of attorneys, actuaries, accountants, and other experts not
 10  5 otherwise a part of the commissioner's staff and all reasonable
 10  6 travel expenses.  Any persons so retained shall be under the
 10  7 direction and control of the commissioner and shall act in a
 10  8 purely advisory capacity.
 10  9    9.  The commissioner shall adopt rules pursuant to chapter
 10 10 17A to administer this section.
 10 11    Sec. 10.  Section 521A.7, subsection 1, Code 2016, is amended
 10 12 to read as follows:
 10 13    1.  All information, documents, and copies thereof obtained
 10 14 by or disclosed to the commissioner or any other person in
 10 15 the course of an examination or investigation made pursuant

 10 17   4 26    1.  a.  The commissioner may act as the group=wide supervisor
  4 27 of an internationally active insurance group in accordance with
  4 28 the provisions of this section.  However, the commissioner may
  4 29 authorize another regulatory official to act as the group=wide

  4 33 United States.

  5  6    b.  In response to a request from an insurance holding
  5  7 company system that does not otherwise qualify as an
  5  8 internationally active insurance group, the commissioner may
  5  9 make a determination of or acknowledge a group=wide supervisor
  5 10 for such an insurance holding company system pursuant to this

  5 18 substantial insurance operations concentrated in this state,
  5 19 or the commissioner may acknowledge that a regulatory official
  5 20 from another jurisdiction is the appropriate group=wide
  5 21 supervisor for the internationally active insurance group.  In
  5 22 making a determination or acknowledgment under this paragraph
  5 23 "a", the commissioner shall consider the following factors:
  5 24    (1)  The place of domicile of the insurers within the
  5 25 internationally active insurance group that hold the largest
  5 26 share of the group's written premiums, assets, or liabilities.

  6 10 internationally active insurance group provides the
  6 11 commissioner with reasonably reciprocal recognition and
  6 12 cooperation.
  6 13    b.  Notwithstanding paragraph "a", even if the commissioner
  6 14 is identified pursuant to this subsection as the group=wide
  6 15 supervisor of an internationally active insurance group,
  6 16 the commissioner may determine that it is appropriate to
  6 17 acknowledge another regulatory official to serve as the
  6 18 group=wide supervisor of the internationally active insurance
  6 19 group.
  6 20    c.  The acknowledgment of a group=wide supervisor pursuant
  6 21 to this subsection shall be made after consideration of the
  6 22 factors listed in paragraph "a", subparagraphs (1) through
  6 23 (5), and shall be made in cooperation with and subject to the

  5 22 making a determination or acknowledgment under this paragraph
  5 23 "a", the commissioner shall consider the following factors:

  5 35 internationally active insurance group under a regulatory
  6  1 system that the commissioner determines to be either of the
  6  2 following:

  6 10 internationally active insurance group provides the
  6 11 commissioner with reasonably reciprocal recognition and

  6 13    b.  Notwithstanding paragraph "a", even if the commissioner
  6 14 is identified pursuant to this subsection as the group=wide
  6 15 supervisor of an internationally active insurance group,
  6 16 the commissioner may determine that it is appropriate to

  6 20    c.  The acknowledgment of a group=wide supervisor pursuant
  6 21 to this subsection shall be made after consideration of the
  6 22 factors listed in paragraph "a", subparagraphs (1) through
  6 23 (5), and shall be made in cooperation with and subject to the
  6 24 acknowledgment of other regulatory officials involved with
  6 25 supervision of members of the internationally active insurance
  6 26 group, and in consultation with the internationally active
  6 27 insurance group.
  6 28    3.  Notwithstanding any other provision of law, when another

  6 30 an internationally active insurance group, the commissioner
  6 31 shall acknowledge that regulatory official as the group=wide
  6 32 supervisor of the internationally active insurance group.
  6 33 However, the commissioner shall make a new determination or
  6 34 acknowledgment as to the appropriate group=wide supervisor for
  6 35 the internationally active insurance group in the event that a
  7  1 material change in the internationally active insurance group
  7  2 results in either of the following:

  7  4 domiciled in Iowa holding the largest share of the group's
  7  5 premiums, assets, or liabilities.

  7 10 authorized to collect from any insurer registered pursuant to
  7 11 section 521A.4 all information necessary to determine whether
  7 12 it is appropriate for the commissioner to act as the group=wide
  7 13 supervisor of an internationally active insurance group or
  7 14 to acknowledge another regulatory official to act as the
  7 15 group=wide supervisor of the internationally active insurance
  7 16 group. Prior to issuing a determination or acknowledgment
  7 17 pursuant to this section, the commissioner shall notify the
  7 18 insurer registered pursuant to section 521A.4 and the ultimate
  7 19 controlling person within the internationally active insurance
  7 20 group of the pending determination or acknowledgment. The
  7 21 insurer and the internationally active insurance group shall
  7 22 have not less than thirty days to provide the commissioner with

  7 24 determination or acknowledgment. The commissioner shall
  7 25 publish the identity of the internationally active insurance
  7 26 groups that the commissioner has determined are subject to
  7 27 group=wide supervision by the commissioner.
  7 28    5.  If a determination is made that the commissioner is the
  7 29 appropriate group=wide supervisor for an internationally active
  7 30 insurance group, the commissioner is authorized to engage in
  7 31 any of the following group=wide supervision activities:
  7 32    a.  Assessing the enterprise risks within the internationally
  7 33 active insurance group to ensure all of the following:
  7 34    (1)  That the material financial condition and liquidity
  7 35 risks to members of the internationally active insurance group
  8  1 that are engaged in the business of insurance are identified
  8  2 by management.
  8  3    (2)  That reasonable and effective mitigation measures are
  8  4 in place.
  8  5    b.  Requesting, from any member of an internationally active
  8  6 insurance group subject to the commissioner's group=wide
  8  7 supervision, information necessary and appropriate to assess
  8  8 enterprise risk, including but not limited to information about
  8  9 the members of the internationally active insurance group
  8 10 regarding all of the following:
  8 11    (1)  Governance, risk assessment, and management.
  8 12    (2)  Capital adequacy.
  8 13    (3)  Material intercompany transactions.
  8 14    c.  Coordinating and, through the authority of the
  8 15 regulatory officials of the jurisdictions where members of
  8 16 the internationally active insurance group are domiciled,
  8 17 compelling the development and implementation of reasonable

  8 20 enterprise risks to members of the internationally active
  8 21 insurance group that are engaged in the business of insurance.
  8 22    d.  Communicating with other state, federal, and
  8 23 international regulatory agencies for members within the
  8 24 internationally active insurance group and sharing relevant
  8 25 information, subject to the confidentiality provisions of
  8 26 section 521A.7, through supervisory colleges as set forth in
  8 27 section 521A.6A or otherwise.
  8 28    e.  Entering into agreements with or obtaining documentation
  8 29 from any insurer registered under section 521A.4, any member
  8 30 of an internationally active insurance group, and any other
  8 31 state, federal, or international regulatory agency for members
  8 32 of the internationally active insurance group, that provides
  8 33 the basis for or otherwise clarifies the commissioner's role as
  8 34 group=wide supervisor of an internationally active insurance
  8 35 group, including provisions for resolving disputes with other
  9  1 regulatory officials. Such agreements or documentation shall
  9  2 not serve as evidence in any proceeding that any insurer or
  9  3 person within an insurance company holding company system not
  9  4 domiciled or incorporated in this state is doing business in
  9  5 this state or is otherwise subject to jurisdiction in this
  9  6 state.
  9  7    f.  Other activities of group=wide supervision, consistent
  9  8 with the authority and purposes set forth in this section, as
  9  9 considered necessary by the commissioner.
  9 10    6.  If the commissioner acknowledges that another regulatory
  9 11 official from a jurisdiction that is not accredited by the
  9 12 national association of insurance commissioners is the
  9 13 group=wide supervisor of an internationally active insurance
  9 14 group, the commissioner may reasonably cooperate through a

  9 16 undertaken by that regulatory official provided that all of the
  9 17 following occur:
  9 18    a.  The commissioner's cooperation is in compliance with the

  9 20    b.  The regulatory official acknowledged as the group=wide
  9 21 supervisor of the internationally active insurance group also
  9 22 recognizes and cooperates with the commissioner's activities
  9 23 as a group=wide supervisor for other internationally active
  9 24 insurance groups, where applicable.  If such recognition and
  9 25 cooperation is not reasonably reciprocal, the commissioner may
  9 26 refuse recognition and cooperation to that regulatory official.
  9 27    7.  The commissioner is authorized to enter into agreements
  9 28 with or obtain documentation from any insurer registered under
  9 29 section 521A.4, any affiliate of the insurer, and any other
  9 30 state, federal, or international regulatory agency for members
  9 31 of the internationally active insurance group, that provides
  9 32 the basis for or otherwise clarifies another regulatory
  9 33 official's role as group=wide supervisor of an internationally
  9 34 active insurance group.
  9 35    8.  An insurer registered under section 521A.4 that is
 10  1 subject to this section shall be liable for and shall pay the
 10  2 reasonable expenses of the commissioner's participation in
 10  3 the administration of this section, including the engagement
 10  4 of attorneys, actuaries, accountants, and other experts not
 10  5 otherwise a part of the commissioner's staff and all reasonable
 10  6 travel expenses.  Any persons so retained shall be under the
 10  7 direction and control of the commissioner and shall act in a
 10  8 purely advisory capacity.
 10  9    9.  The commissioner shall adopt rules pursuant to chapter
 10 10 17A to administer this section.
 10 11    Sec. 10.  Section 521A.7, subsection 1, Code 2016, is amended
 10 12 to read as follows:
 10 13    1.  All information, documents, and copies thereof obtained
 10 14 by or disclosed to the commissioner or any other person in
 10 15 the course of an examination or investigation made pursuant
 10 16 to section 521A.6 or 521A.6A, and all information reported
 10 17   4 28 the provisions of this section.  However, the commissioner may
  4 29 authorize another regulatory official to act as the group=wide

  4 35 States, but not in Iowa.

  5  5 supervisor.
  5  6    b.  In response to a request from an insurance holding
  5  7 company system that does not otherwise qualify as an
  5  8 internationally active insurance group, the commissioner may
  5  9 make a determination of or acknowledge a group=wide supervisor
  5 10 for such an insurance holding company system pursuant to this
  5 11 section.
  5 12    2.  a.  In cooperation with other state, federal, and
  5 13 international regulatory agencies, the commissioner shall
  5 14 identify a single group=wide supervisor for an internationally

  5 16 the commissioner is the appropriate group=wide supervisor
  5 17 for an internationally active insurance group that conducts
  5 18 substantial insurance operations concentrated in this state,
  5 19 or the commissioner may acknowledge that a regulatory official
  5 20 from another jurisdiction is the appropriate group=wide
  5 21 supervisor for the internationally active insurance group.  In
  5 22 making a determination or acknowledgment under this paragraph
  5 23 "a", the commissioner shall consider the following factors:
  5 24    (1)  The place of domicile of the insurers within the
  5 25 internationally active insurance group that hold the largest
  5 26 share of the group's written premiums, assets, or liabilities.

  5 28 insurance holding company system of the internationally active
  5 29 insurance group.
  5 30    (3)  The location of the executive offices or largest
  5 31 operational offices of the internationally active insurance
  5 32 group.
  5 33    (4)  Whether another regulatory official is acting as
  5 34 or is seeking to act as the group=wide supervisor of the
  5 35 internationally active insurance group under a regulatory
  6  1 system that the commissioner determines to be either of the
  6  2 following:
  6  3    (a)  Substantially similar to the system of regulation
  6  4 provided under the laws of this state.
  6  5    (b)  Otherwise sufficient in terms of providing for
  6  6 group=wide supervision, enterprise risk analysis, and
  6  7 cooperation with other regulatory officials.
  6  8    (5)  Whether another regulatory official acting as
  6  9 or seeking to act as the group=wide supervisor for the
  6 10 internationally active insurance group provides the
  6 11 commissioner with reasonably reciprocal recognition and
  6 12 cooperation.
  6 13    b.  Notwithstanding paragraph "a", even if the commissioner
  6 14 is identified pursuant to this subsection as the group=wide
  6 15 supervisor of an internationally active insurance group,
  6 16 the commissioner may determine that it is appropriate to
  6 17 acknowledge another regulatory official to serve as the
  6 18 group=wide supervisor of the internationally active insurance
  6 19 group.
  6 20    c.  The acknowledgment of a group=wide supervisor pursuant
  6 21 to this subsection shall be made after consideration of the
  6 22 factors listed in paragraph "a", subparagraphs (1) through
  6 23 (5), and shall be made in cooperation with and subject to the
  6 24 acknowledgment of other regulatory officials involved with
  6 25 supervision of members of the internationally active insurance
  6 26 group, and in consultation with the internationally active
  6 27 insurance group.
  6 28    3.  Notwithstanding any other provision of law, when another
  6 29 regulatory official is acting as the group=wide supervisor of
  6 30 an internationally active insurance group, the commissioner
  6 31 shall acknowledge that regulatory official as the group=wide
  6 32 supervisor of the internationally active insurance group.
  6 33 However, the commissioner shall make a new determination or
  6 34 acknowledgment as to the appropriate group=wide supervisor for
  6 35 the internationally active insurance group in the event that a
  7  1 material change in the internationally active insurance group
  7  2 results in either of the following:
  7  3    a.  The internationally active insurance group's insurers
  7  4 domiciled in Iowa holding the largest share of the group's
  7  5 premiums, assets, or liabilities.
  7  6    b.  Iowa being the place of domicile of the top=tiered
  7  7 insurers in the insurance holding company system of the
  7  8 internationally active insurance group.
  7  9    4.  Pursuant to section 521A.6, the commissioner is
  7 10 authorized to collect from any insurer registered pursuant to
  7 11 section 521A.4 all information necessary to determine whether
  7 12 it is appropriate for the commissioner to act as the group=wide
  7 13 supervisor of an internationally active insurance group or
  7 14 to acknowledge another regulatory official to act as the
  7 15 group=wide supervisor of the internationally active insurance
  7 16 group. Prior to issuing a determination or acknowledgment
  7 17 pursuant to this section, the commissioner shall notify the
  7 18 insurer registered pursuant to section 521A.4 and the ultimate
  7 19 controlling person within the internationally active insurance
  7 20 group of the pending determination or acknowledgment. The
  7 21 insurer and the internationally active insurance group shall
  7 22 have not less than thirty days to provide the commissioner with
  7 23 additional information pertinent to the commissioner's pending
  7 24 determination or acknowledgment. The commissioner shall
  7 25 publish the identity of the internationally active insurance
  7 26 groups that the commissioner has determined are subject to
  7 27 group=wide supervision by the commissioner.
  7 28    5.  If a determination is made that the commissioner is the
  7 29 appropriate group=wide supervisor for an internationally active
  7 30 insurance group, the commissioner is authorized to engage in
  7 31 any of the following group=wide supervision activities:
  7 32    a.  Assessing the enterprise risks within the internationally
  7 33 active insurance group to ensure all of the following:

  9  2 not serve as evidence in any proceeding that any insurer or
  9  3 person within an insurance company holding company system not

  9 27    7.  The commissioner is authorized to enter into agreements
  9 28 with or obtain documentation from any insurer registered under
  9 29 section 521A.4, any affiliate of the insurer, and any other
  9 30 state, federal, or international regulatory agency for members
  9 31 of the internationally active insurance group, that provides
  9 32 the basis for or otherwise clarifies another regulatory
  9 33 official's role as group=wide supervisor of an internationally
  9 34 active insurance group.

  5  5 supervisor.
  5  6    b.  In response to a request from an insurance holding
  5  7 company system that does not otherwise qualify as an
  5  8 internationally active insurance group, the commissioner may
  5  9 make a determination of or acknowledge a group=wide supervisor
  5 10 for such an insurance holding company system pursuant to this
  5 11 section.
  5 12    2.  a.  In cooperation with other state, federal, and
  5 13 international regulatory agencies, the commissioner shall
  5 14 identify a single group=wide supervisor for an internationally

  5 17 for an internationally active insurance group that conducts
  5 18 substantial insurance operations concentrated in this state,
  5 19 or the commissioner may acknowledge that a regulatory official
  5 20 from another jurisdiction is the appropriate group=wide
  5 21 supervisor for the internationally active insurance group.  In
  5 22 making a determination or acknowledgment under this paragraph
  5 23 "a", the commissioner shall consider the following factors:
  5 24    (1)  The place of domicile of the insurers within the
  5 25 internationally active insurance group that hold the largest
  5 26 share of the group's written premiums, assets, or liabilities.

  5 34 or is seeking to act as the group=wide supervisor of the
  5 35 internationally active insurance group under a regulatory
  6  1 system that the commissioner determines to be either of the
  6  2 following:
  6  3    (a)  Substantially similar to the system of regulation
  6  4 provided under the laws of this state.
  6  5    (b)  Otherwise sufficient in terms of providing for
  6  6 group=wide supervision, enterprise risk analysis, and
  6  7 cooperation with other regulatory officials.
  6  8    (5)  Whether another regulatory official acting as
  6  9 or seeking to act as the group=wide supervisor for the
  6 10 internationally active insurance group provides the
  6 11 commissioner with reasonably reciprocal recognition and
  6 12 cooperation.
  6 13    b.  Notwithstanding paragraph "a", even if the commissioner
  6 14 is identified pursuant to this subsection as the group=wide
  6 15 supervisor of an internationally active insurance group,
  6 16 the commissioner may determine that it is appropriate to
  6 17 acknowledge another regulatory official to serve as the
  6 18 group=wide supervisor of the internationally active insurance
  6 19 group.
  6 20    c.  The acknowledgment of a group=wide supervisor pursuant
  6 21 to this subsection shall be made after consideration of the
  6 22 factors listed in paragraph "a", subparagraphs (1) through
  6 23 (5), and shall be made in cooperation with and subject to the

  6 28    3.  Notwithstanding any other provision of law, when another
  6 29 regulatory official is acting as the group=wide supervisor of
  6 30 an internationally active insurance group, the commissioner
  6 31 shall acknowledge that regulatory official as the group=wide
  6 32 supervisor of the internationally active insurance group.
  6 33 However, the commissioner shall make a new determination or
  6 34 acknowledgment as to the appropriate group=wide supervisor for
  6 35 the internationally active insurance group in the event that a
  7  1 material change in the internationally active insurance group
  7  2 results in either of the following:
  7  3    a.  The internationally active insurance group's insurers
  7  4 domiciled in Iowa holding the largest share of the group's
  7  5 premiums, assets, or liabilities.

  7  7 insurers in the insurance holding company system of the

  7 12 it is appropriate for the commissioner to act as the group=wide
  7 13 supervisor of an internationally active insurance group or
  7 14 to acknowledge another regulatory official to act as the
  7 15 group=wide supervisor of the internationally active insurance
  7 16 group. Prior to issuing a determination or acknowledgment
  7 17 pursuant to this section, the commissioner shall notify the

  7 26 groups that the commissioner has determined are subject to
  7 27 group=wide supervision by the commissioner.
  7 28    5.  If a determination is made that the commissioner is the

  9 21 supervisor of the internationally active insurance group also
  9 22 recognizes and cooperates with the commissioner's activities
  9 23 as a group=wide supervisor for other internationally active
  9 24 insurance groups, where applicable.  If such recognition and
  9 25 cooperation is not reasonably reciprocal, the commissioner may
  9 26 refuse recognition and cooperation to that regulatory official.
  9 27    7.  The commissioner is authorized to enter into agreements
  9 28 with or obtain documentation from any insurer registered under
  9 29 section 521A.4, any affiliate of the insurer, and any other
  9 30 state, federal, or international regulatory agency for members
  9 31 of the internationally active insurance group, that provides
  9 32 the basis for or otherwise clarifies another regulatory
  9 33 official's role as group=wide supervisor of an internationally
  9 34 active insurance group.
  9 35    8.  An insurer registered under section 521A.4 that is
 10  1 subject to this section shall be liable for and shall pay the
 10  2 reasonable expenses of the commissioner's participation in
 10  3 the administration of this section, including the engagement
 10  4 of attorneys, actuaries, accountants, and other experts not
 10  5 otherwise a part of the commissioner's staff and all reasonable
 10  6 travel expenses.  Any persons so retained shall be under the
 10  7 direction and control of the commissioner and shall act in a
 10  8 purely advisory capacity.
 10  9    9.  The commissioner shall adopt rules pursuant to chapter
 10 10 17A to administer this section.
 10 11    Sec. 10.  Section 521A.7, subsection 1, Code 2016, is amended

 10 13    1.  All information, documents, and copies thereof obtained
 10 14 by or disclosed to the commissioner or any other person in
 10 15 the course of an examination or investigation made pursuant

  4 33 United States.
  4 34    (2)  Has substantial insurance operations in the United
  4 35 States, but not in Iowa.
  5  1    (3)  Has substantial insurance operations in the United
  5  2 States and in Iowa, but the commissioner has determined
  5  3 pursuant to the factors set forth in subsections 2 and 6 that
  5  4 another regulatory official is the appropriate group=wide
  5  5 supervisor.
  5  6    b.  In response to a request from an insurance holding
  5  7 company system that does not otherwise qualify as an
  5  8 internationally active insurance group, the commissioner may
  5  9 make a determination of or acknowledge a group=wide supervisor
  5 10 for such an insurance holding company system pursuant to this
  5 11 section.
  5 12    2.  a.  In cooperation with other state, federal, and
  5 13 international regulatory agencies, the commissioner shall
  5 14 identify a single group=wide supervisor for an internationally
  5 15 active insurance group.  The commissioner may determine that
  5 16 the commissioner is the appropriate group=wide supervisor
  5 17 for an internationally active insurance group that conducts
  5 18 substantial insurance operations concentrated in this state,
  5 19 or the commissioner may acknowledge that a regulatory official
  5 20 from another jurisdiction is the appropriate group=wide
  5 21 supervisor for the internationally active insurance group.  In
  5 22 making a determination or acknowledgment under this paragraph
  5 23 "a", the commissioner shall consider the following factors:
  5 24    (1)  The place of domicile of the insurers within the
  5 25 internationally active insurance group that hold the largest
  5 26 share of the group's written premiums, assets, or liabilities.
  5 27    (2)  The place of domicile of the top=tiered insurers in the
  5 28 insurance holding company system of the internationally active
  5 29 insurance group.
  5 30    (3)  The location of the executive offices or largest
  5 31 operational offices of the internationally active insurance
  5 32 group.
  5 33    (4)  Whether another regulatory official is acting as
  5 34 or is seeking to act as the group=wide supervisor of the
  5 35 internationally active insurance group under a regulatory
  6  1 system that the commissioner determines to be either of the
  6  2 following:
  6  3    (a)  Substantially similar to the system of regulation
  6  4 provided under the laws of this state.
  6  5    (b)  Otherwise sufficient in terms of providing for
  6  6 group=wide supervision, enterprise risk analysis, and
  6  7 cooperation with other regulatory officials.
  6  8    (5)  Whether another regulatory official acting as
  6  9 or seeking to act as the group=wide supervisor for the
  6 10 internationally active insurance group provides the
  6 11 commissioner with reasonably reciprocal recognition and
  6 12 cooperation.
  6 13    b.  Notwithstanding paragraph "a", even if the commissioner
  6 14 is identified pursuant to this subsection as the group=wide
  6 15 supervisor of an internationally active insurance group,
  6 16 the commissioner may determine that it is appropriate to
  6 17 acknowledge another regulatory official to serve as the
  6 18 group=wide supervisor of the internationally active insurance
  6 19 group.
  6 20    c.  The acknowledgment of a group=wide supervisor pursuant
  6 21 to this subsection shall be made after consideration of the
  6 22 factors listed in paragraph "a", subparagraphs (1) through
  6 23 (5), and shall be made in cooperation with and subject to the
  6 24 acknowledgment of other regulatory officials involved with
  6 25 supervision of members of the internationally active insurance
  6 26 group, and in consultation with the internationally active
  6 27 insurance group.
  6 28    3.  Notwithstanding any other provision of law, when another
  6 29 regulatory official is acting as the group=wide supervisor of
  6 30 an internationally active insurance group, the commissioner
  6 31 shall acknowledge that regulatory official as the group=wide
  6 32 supervisor of the internationally active insurance group.
  6 33 However, the commissioner shall make a new determination or
  6 34 acknowledgment as to the appropriate group=wide supervisor for
  6 35 the internationally active insurance group in the event that a
  7  1 material change in the internationally active insurance group
  7  2 results in either of the following:
  7  3    a.  The internationally active insurance group's insurers
  7  4 domiciled in Iowa holding the largest share of the group's
  7  5 premiums, assets, or liabilities.
  7  6    b.  Iowa being the place of domicile of the top=tiered
  7  7 insurers in the insurance holding company system of the
  7  8 internationally active insurance group.
  7  9    4.  Pursuant to section 521A.6, the commissioner is
  7 10 authorized to collect from any insurer registered pursuant to
  7 11 section 521A.4 all information necessary to determine whether
  7 12 it is appropriate for the commissioner to act as the group=wide
  7 13 supervisor of an internationally active insurance group or
  7 14 to acknowledge another regulatory official to act as the
  7 15 group=wide supervisor of the internationally active insurance
  7 16 group. Prior to issuing a determination or acknowledgment
  7 17 pursuant to this section, the commissioner shall notify the
  7 18 insurer registered pursuant to section 521A.4 and the ultimate
  7 19 controlling person within the internationally active insurance
  7 20 group of the pending determination or acknowledgment. The
  7 21 insurer and the internationally active insurance group shall
  7 22 have not less than thirty days to provide the commissioner with
  7 23 additional information pertinent to the commissioner's pending
  7 24 determination or acknowledgment. The commissioner shall
  7 25 publish the identity of the internationally active insurance
  7 26 groups that the commissioner has determined are subject to
  7 27 group=wide supervision by the commissioner.
  7 28    5.  If a determination is made that the commissioner is the
  7 29 appropriate group=wide supervisor for an internationally active
  7 30 insurance group, the commissioner is authorized to engage in
  7 31 any of the following group=wide supervision activities:
  7 32    a.  Assessing the enterprise risks within the internationally
  7 33 active insurance group to ensure all of the following:
  7 34    (1)  That the material financial condition and liquidity

  8  1 that are engaged in the business of insurance are identified
  8  2 by management.
  8  3    (2)  That reasonable and effective mitigation measures are
  8  4 in place.
  8  5    b.  Requesting, from any member of an internationally active
  8  6 insurance group subject to the commissioner's group=wide
  8  7 supervision, information necessary and appropriate to assess
  8  8 enterprise risk, including but not limited to information about
  8  9 the members of the internationally active insurance group
  8 10 regarding all of the following:
  8 11    (1)  Governance, risk assessment, and management.
  8 12    (2)  Capital adequacy.

  8 15 regulatory officials of the jurisdictions where members of
  8 16 the internationally active insurance group are domiciled,
  8 17 compelling the development and implementation of reasonable
  8 18 measures designed to ensure that the internationally active
  8 19 insurance group is able to timely recognize and mitigate
  8 20 enterprise risks to members of the internationally active
  8 21 insurance group that are engaged in the business of insurance.
  8 22    d.  Communicating with other state, federal, and
  8 23 international regulatory agencies for members within the
  8 24 internationally active insurance group and sharing relevant
  8 25 information, subject to the confidentiality provisions of
  8 26 section 521A.7, through supervisory colleges as set forth in
  8 27 section 521A.6A or otherwise.
  8 28    e.  Entering into agreements with or obtaining documentation
  8 29 from any insurer registered under section 521A.4, any member
  8 30 of an internationally active insurance group, and any other
  8 31 state, federal, or international regulatory agency for members
  8 32 of the internationally active insurance group, that provides
  8 33 the basis for or otherwise clarifies the commissioner's role as
  8 34 group=wide supervisor of an internationally active insurance
  8 35 group, including provisions for resolving disputes with other
  9  1 regulatory officials. Such agreements or documentation shall
  9  2 not serve as evidence in any proceeding that any insurer or
  9  3 person within an insurance company holding company system not
  9  4 domiciled or incorporated in this state is doing business in
  9  5 this state or is otherwise subject to jurisdiction in this
  9  6 state.

  9  8 with the authority and purposes set forth in this section, as

  9 11 official from a jurisdiction that is not accredited by the
  9 12 national association of insurance commissioners is the
  9 13 group=wide supervisor of an internationally active insurance
  9 14 group, the commissioner may reasonably cooperate through a

  9 16 undertaken by that regulatory official provided that all of the

  9 20    b.  The regulatory official acknowledged as the group=wide
  9 21 supervisor of the internationally active insurance group also
  9 22 recognizes and cooperates with the commissioner's activities
  9 23 as a group=wide supervisor for other internationally active
  9 24 insurance groups, where applicable.  If such recognition and
  9 25 cooperation is not reasonably reciprocal, the commissioner may
  9 26 refuse recognition and cooperation to that regulatory official.
  9 27    7.  The commissioner is authorized to enter into agreements
  9 28 with or obtain documentation from any insurer registered under
  9 29 section 521A.4, any affiliate of the insurer, and any other
  9 30 state, federal, or international regulatory agency for members
  9 31 of the internationally active insurance group, that provides
  9 32 the basis for or otherwise clarifies another regulatory
  9 33 official's role as group=wide supervisor of an internationally
  9 34 active insurance group.
  9 35    8.  An insurer registered under section 521A.4 that is
 10  1 subject to this section shall be liable for and shall pay the
 10  2 reasonable expenses of the commissioner's participation in
 10  3 the administration of this section, including the engagement

 10  7 direction and control of the commissioner and shall act in a
 10  8 purely advisory capacity.
 10  9    9.  The commissioner shall adopt rules pursuant to chapter
 10 10 17A to administer this section.

  5 35 internationally active insurance group under a regulatory
  6  1 system that the commissioner determines to be either of the
  6  2 following:

  6 19 group.
  6 20    c.  The acknowledgment of a group=wide supervisor pursuant

  5 22 making a determination or acknowledgment under this paragraph
  5 23 "a", the commissioner shall consider the following factors:
  5 24    (1)  The place of domicile of the insurers within the
  5 25 internationally active insurance group that hold the largest
  5 26 share of the group's written premiums, assets, or liabilities.
  5 27    (2)  The place of domicile of the top=tiered insurers in the
  5 28 insurance holding company system of the internationally active
  5 29 insurance group.
  5 30    (3)  The location of the executive offices or largest
  5 31 operational offices of the internationally active insurance
  5 32 group.
  5 33    (4)  Whether another regulatory official is acting as
  5 34 or is seeking to act as the group=wide supervisor of the
  5 35 internationally active insurance group under a regulatory
  6  1 system that the commissioner determines to be either of the
  6  2 following:
  6  3    (a)  Substantially similar to the system of regulation
  6  4 provided under the laws of this state.
  6  5    (b)  Otherwise sufficient in terms of providing for
  6  6 group=wide supervision, enterprise risk analysis, and
  6  7 cooperation with other regulatory officials.
  6  8    (5)  Whether another regulatory official acting as
  6  9 or seeking to act as the group=wide supervisor for the
  6 10 internationally active insurance group provides the
  6 11 commissioner with reasonably reciprocal recognition and
  6 12 cooperation.
  6 13    b.  Notwithstanding paragraph "a", even if the commissioner
  6 14 is identified pursuant to this subsection as the group=wide
  6 15 supervisor of an internationally active insurance group,
  6 16 the commissioner may determine that it is appropriate to
  6 17 acknowledge another regulatory official to serve as the
  6 18 group=wide supervisor of the internationally active insurance
  6 19 group.
  6 20    c.  The acknowledgment of a group=wide supervisor pursuant
  6 21 to this subsection shall be made after consideration of the
  6 22 factors listed in paragraph "a", subparagraphs (1) through
  6 23 (5), and shall be made in cooperation with and subject to the
  6 24 acknowledgment of other regulatory officials involved with
  6 25 supervision of members of the internationally active insurance
  6 26 group, and in consultation with the internationally active
  6 27 insurance group.
  6 28    3.  Notwithstanding any other provision of law, when another
  6 29 regulatory official is acting as the group=wide supervisor of
  6 30 an internationally active insurance group, the commissioner
  6 31 shall acknowledge that regulatory official as the group=wide
  6 32 supervisor of the internationally active insurance group.
  6 33 However, the commissioner shall make a new determination or
  6 34 acknowledgment as to the appropriate group=wide supervisor for
  6 35 the internationally active insurance group in the event that a
  7  1 material change in the internationally active insurance group
  7  2 results in either of the following:
  7  3    a.  The internationally active insurance group's insurers
  7  4 domiciled in Iowa holding the largest share of the group's
  7  5 premiums, assets, or liabilities.
  7  6    b.  Iowa being the place of domicile of the top=tiered
  7  7 insurers in the insurance holding company system of the

  7  9    4.  Pursuant to section 521A.6, the commissioner is
  7 10 authorized to collect from any insurer registered pursuant to
  7 11 section 521A.4 all information necessary to determine whether
  7 12 it is appropriate for the commissioner to act as the group=wide
  7 13 supervisor of an internationally active insurance group or
  7 14 to acknowledge another regulatory official to act as the
  7 15 group=wide supervisor of the internationally active insurance
  7 16 group. Prior to issuing a determination or acknowledgment
  7 17 pursuant to this section, the commissioner shall notify the
  7 18 insurer registered pursuant to section 521A.4 and the ultimate
  7 19 controlling person within the internationally active insurance
  7 20 group of the pending determination or acknowledgment. The
  7 21 insurer and the internationally active insurance group shall
  7 22 have not less than thirty days to provide the commissioner with
  7 23 additional information pertinent to the commissioner's pending
  7 24 determination or acknowledgment. The commissioner shall
  7 25 publish the identity of the internationally active insurance
  7 26 groups that the commissioner has determined are subject to
  7 27 group=wide supervision by the commissioner.
  7 28    5.  If a determination is made that the commissioner is the
  7 29 appropriate group=wide supervisor for an internationally active
  7 30 insurance group, the commissioner is authorized to engage in
  7 31 any of the following group=wide supervision activities:
  7 32    a.  Assessing the enterprise risks within the internationally
  7 33 active insurance group to ensure all of the following:

  8  1 that are engaged in the business of insurance are identified
  8  2 by management.
  8  3    (2)  That reasonable and effective mitigation measures are
  8  4 in place.
  8  5    b.  Requesting, from any member of an internationally active
  8  6 insurance group subject to the commissioner's group=wide
  8  7 supervision, information necessary and appropriate to assess
  8  8 enterprise risk, including but not limited to information about
  8  9 the members of the internationally active insurance group
  8 10 regarding all of the following:
  8 11    (1)  Governance, risk assessment, and management.
  8 12    (2)  Capital adequacy.
  8 13    (3)  Material intercompany transactions.

  8 19 insurance group is able to timely recognize and mitigate
  8 20 enterprise risks to members of the internationally active
  8 21 insurance group that are engaged in the business of insurance.
  8 22    d.  Communicating with other state, federal, and
  8 23 international regulatory agencies for members within the
  8 24 internationally active insurance group and sharing relevant
  8 25 information, subject to the confidentiality provisions of
  8 26 section 521A.7, through supervisory colleges as set forth in
  8 27 section 521A.6A or otherwise.
  8 28    e.  Entering into agreements with or obtaining documentation

  8 30 of an internationally active insurance group, and any other
  8 31 state, federal, or international regulatory agency for members
  8 32 of the internationally active insurance group, that provides
  8 33 the basis for or otherwise clarifies the commissioner's role as
  8 34 group=wide supervisor of an internationally active insurance
  8 35 group, including provisions for resolving disputes with other
  9  1 regulatory officials. Such agreements or documentation shall
  9  2 not serve as evidence in any proceeding that any insurer or
  9  3 person within an insurance company holding company system not
  9  4 domiciled or incorporated in this state is doing business in
  9  5 this state or is otherwise subject to jurisdiction in this
  9  6 state.
  9  7    f.  Other activities of group=wide supervision, consistent
  9  8 with the authority and purposes set forth in this section, as

  9 11 official from a jurisdiction that is not accredited by the
  9 12 national association of insurance commissioners is the
  9 13 group=wide supervisor of an internationally active insurance
  9 14 group, the commissioner may reasonably cooperate through a
  9 15 supervisory college or otherwise, with group=wide supervision
  9 16 undertaken by that regulatory official provided that all of the
  9 17 following occur:
  9 18    a.  The commissioner's cooperation is in compliance with the
  9 19 laws of this state.
  9 20    b.  The regulatory official acknowledged as the group=wide
  9 21 supervisor of the internationally active insurance group also
  9 22 recognizes and cooperates with the commissioner's activities
  9 23 as a group=wide supervisor for other internationally active
  9 24 insurance groups, where applicable.  If such recognition and
  9 25 cooperation is not reasonably reciprocal, the commissioner may
  9 26 refuse recognition and cooperation to that regulatory official.
  9 27    7.  The commissioner is authorized to enter into agreements
  9 28 with or obtain documentation from any insurer registered under
  9 29 section 521A.4, any affiliate of the insurer, and any other
  9 30 state, federal, or international regulatory agency for members
  9 31 of the internationally active insurance group, that provides
  9 32 the basis for or otherwise clarifies another regulatory
  9 33 official's role as group=wide supervisor of an internationally
  9 34 active insurance group.
  9 35    8.  An insurer registered under section 521A.4 that is
 10  1 subject to this section shall be liable for and shall pay the
 10  2 reasonable expenses of the commissioner's participation in
 10  3 the administration of this section, including the engagement
 10  4 of attorneys, actuaries, accountants, and other experts not
 10  5 otherwise a part of the commissioner's staff and all reasonable
 10  6 travel expenses.  Any persons so retained shall be under the
 10  7 direction and control of the commissioner and shall act in a
 10  8 purely advisory capacity.
 10  9    9.  The commissioner shall adopt rules pursuant to chapter
 10 10 17A to administer this section.
 10 11    Sec. 10.  Section 521A.7, subsection 1, Code 2016, is amended

 10 17   4 35 States, but not in Iowa.
  5  1    (3)  Has substantial insurance operations in the United
  5  2 States and in Iowa, but the commissioner has determined
  5  3 pursuant to the factors set forth in subsections 2 and 6 that

  5  5 supervisor.
  5  6    b.  In response to a request from an insurance holding
  5  7 company system that does not otherwise qualify as an
  5  8 internationally active insurance group, the commissioner may
  5  9 make a determination of or acknowledge a group=wide supervisor
  5 10 for such an insurance holding company system pursuant to this
  5 11 section.
  5 12    2.  a.  In cooperation with other state, federal, and
  5 13 international regulatory agencies, the commissioner shall
  5 14 identify a single group=wide supervisor for an internationally
  5 15 active insurance group.  The commissioner may determine that

  5 17 for an internationally active insurance group that conducts
  5 18 substantial insurance operations concentrated in this state,
  5 19 or the commissioner may acknowledge that a regulatory official
  5 20 from another jurisdiction is the appropriate group=wide
  5 21 supervisor for the internationally active insurance group.  In
  5 22 making a determination or acknowledgment under this paragraph
  5 23 "a", the commissioner shall consider the following factors:

  5 34 or is seeking to act as the group=wide supervisor of the
  5 35 internationally active insurance group under a regulatory
  6  1 system that the commissioner determines to be either of the
  6  2 following:
  6  3    (a)  Substantially similar to the system of regulation
  6  4 provided under the laws of this state.
  6  5    (b)  Otherwise sufficient in terms of providing for
  6  6 group=wide supervision, enterprise risk analysis, and
  6  7 cooperation with other regulatory officials.
  6  8    (5)  Whether another regulatory official acting as
  6  9 or seeking to act as the group=wide supervisor for the
  6 10 internationally active insurance group provides the
  6 11 commissioner with reasonably reciprocal recognition and
  6 12 cooperation.
  6 13    b.  Notwithstanding paragraph "a", even if the commissioner
  6 14 is identified pursuant to this subsection as the group=wide
  6 15 supervisor of an internationally active insurance group,
  6 16 the commissioner may determine that it is appropriate to
  6 17 acknowledge another regulatory official to serve as the
  6 18 group=wide supervisor of the internationally active insurance
  6 19 group.
  6 20    c.  The acknowledgment of a group=wide supervisor pursuant
  6 21 to this subsection shall be made after consideration of the
  6 22 factors listed in paragraph "a", subparagraphs (1) through
  6 23 (5), and shall be made in cooperation with and subject to the
  6 24 acknowledgment of other regulatory officials involved with
  6 25 supervision of members of the internationally active insurance
  6 26 group, and in consultation with the internationally active
  6 27 insurance group.
  6 28    3.  Notwithstanding any other provision of law, when another
  6 29 regulatory official is acting as the group=wide supervisor of
  6 30 an internationally active insurance group, the commissioner
  6 31 shall acknowledge that regulatory official as the group=wide
  6 32 supervisor of the internationally active insurance group.
  6 33 However, the commissioner shall make a new determination or
  6 34 acknowledgment as to the appropriate group=wide supervisor for
  6 35 the internationally active insurance group in the event that a
  7  1 material change in the internationally active insurance group
  7  2 results in either of the following:
  7  3    a.  The internationally active insurance group's insurers
  7  4 domiciled in Iowa holding the largest share of the group's
  7  5 premiums, assets, or liabilities.

  7  7 insurers in the insurance holding company system of the

  7 10 authorized to collect from any insurer registered pursuant to
  7 11 section 521A.4 all information necessary to determine whether
  7 12 it is appropriate for the commissioner to act as the group=wide
  7 13 supervisor of an internationally active insurance group or
  7 14 to acknowledge another regulatory official to act as the
  7 15 group=wide supervisor of the internationally active insurance
  7 16 group. Prior to issuing a determination or acknowledgment
  7 17 pursuant to this section, the commissioner shall notify the
  7 18 insurer registered pursuant to section 521A.4 and the ultimate
  7 19 controlling person within the internationally active insurance
  7 20 group of the pending determination or acknowledgment. The
  7 21 insurer and the internationally active insurance group shall
  7 22 have not less than thirty days to provide the commissioner with

  7 24 determination or acknowledgment. The commissioner shall
  7 25 publish the identity of the internationally active insurance
  7 26 groups that the commissioner has determined are subject to
  7 27 group=wide supervision by the commissioner.
  7 28    5.  If a determination is made that the commissioner is the
  7 29 appropriate group=wide supervisor for an internationally active
  7 30 insurance group, the commissioner is authorized to engage in
  7 31 any of the following group=wide supervision activities:

  8 21 insurance group that are engaged in the business of insurance.
  8 22    d.  Communicating with other state, federal, and

  9 27    7.  The commissioner is authorized to enter into agreements
  9 28 with or obtain documentation from any insurer registered under
  9 29 section 521A.4, any affiliate of the insurer, and any other

  9 35    8.  An insurer registered under section 521A.4 that is
 10  1 subject to this section shall be liable for and shall pay the
 10  2 reasonable expenses of the commissioner's participation in

 10 12 to read as follows:
 10 13    1.  All information, documents, and copies thereof obtained
 10 14 by or disclosed to the commissioner or any other person in
 10 15 the course of an examination or investigation made pursuant

 10 17   5  1    (3)  Has substantial insurance operations in the United
  5  2 States and in Iowa, but the commissioner has determined
  5  3 pursuant to the factors set forth in subsections 2 and 6 that

  5  5 supervisor.
  5  6    b.  In response to a request from an insurance holding
  5  7 company system that does not otherwise qualify as an
  5  8 internationally active insurance group, the commissioner may
  5  9 make a determination of or acknowledge a group=wide supervisor
  5 10 for such an insurance holding company system pursuant to this
  5 11 section.
  5 12    2.  a.  In cooperation with other state, federal, and
  5 13 international regulatory agencies, the commissioner shall
  5 14 identify a single group=wide supervisor for an internationally
  5 15 active insurance group.  The commissioner may determine that
  5 16 the commissioner is the appropriate group=wide supervisor
  5 17 for an internationally active insurance group that conducts
  5 18 substantial insurance operations concentrated in this state,
  5 19 or the commissioner may acknowledge that a regulatory official
  5 20 from another jurisdiction is the appropriate group=wide
  5 21 supervisor for the internationally active insurance group.  In
  5 22 making a determination or acknowledgment under this paragraph
  5 23 "a", the commissioner shall consider the following factors:

  5 35 internationally active insurance group under a regulatory
  6  1 system that the commissioner determines to be either of the
  6  2 following:
  6  3    (a)  Substantially similar to the system of regulation
  6  4 provided under the laws of this state.
  6  5    (b)  Otherwise sufficient in terms of providing for
  6  6 group=wide supervision, enterprise risk analysis, and
  6  7 cooperation with other regulatory officials.
  6  8    (5)  Whether another regulatory official acting as
  6  9 or seeking to act as the group=wide supervisor for the

  6 13    b.  Notwithstanding paragraph "a", even if the commissioner
  6 14 is identified pursuant to this subsection as the group=wide
  6 15 supervisor of an internationally active insurance group,
  6 16 the commissioner may determine that it is appropriate to
  6 17 acknowledge another regulatory official to serve as the
  6 18 group=wide supervisor of the internationally active insurance
  6 19 group.
  6 20    c.  The acknowledgment of a group=wide supervisor pursuant
  6 21 to this subsection shall be made after consideration of the
  6 22 factors listed in paragraph "a", subparagraphs (1) through
  6 23 (5), and shall be made in cooperation with and subject to the
  6 24 acknowledgment of other regulatory officials involved with
  6 25 supervision of members of the internationally active insurance
  6 26 group, and in consultation with the internationally active
  6 27 insurance group.
  6 28    3.  Notwithstanding any other provision of law, when another
  6 29 regulatory official is acting as the group=wide supervisor of
  6 30 an internationally active insurance group, the commissioner
  6 31 shall acknowledge that regulatory official as the group=wide
  6 32 supervisor of the internationally active insurance group.
  6 33 However, the commissioner shall make a new determination or
  6 34 acknowledgment as to the appropriate group=wide supervisor for
  6 35 the internationally active insurance group in the event that a
  7  1 material change in the internationally active insurance group
  7  2 results in either of the following:
  7  3    a.  The internationally active insurance group's insurers
  7  4 domiciled in Iowa holding the largest share of the group's
  7  5 premiums, assets, or liabilities.

  7  7 insurers in the insurance holding company system of the

  7 13 supervisor of an internationally active insurance group or
  7 14 to acknowledge another regulatory official to act as the
  7 15 group=wide supervisor of the internationally active insurance
  7 16 group. Prior to issuing a determination or acknowledgment
  7 17 pursuant to this section, the commissioner shall notify the
  7 18 insurer registered pursuant to section 521A.4 and the ultimate
  7 19 controlling person within the internationally active insurance
  7 20 group of the pending determination or acknowledgment. The
  7 21 insurer and the internationally active insurance group shall
  7 22 have not less than thirty days to provide the commissioner with
  7 23 additional information pertinent to the commissioner's pending
  7 24 determination or acknowledgment. The commissioner shall
  7 25 publish the identity of the internationally active insurance
  7 26 groups that the commissioner has determined are subject to
  7 27 group=wide supervision by the commissioner.
  7 28    5.  If a determination is made that the commissioner is the
  7 29 appropriate group=wide supervisor for an internationally active
  7 30 insurance group, the commissioner is authorized to engage in
  7 31 any of the following group=wide supervision activities:
  7 32    a.  Assessing the enterprise risks within the internationally
  7 33 active insurance group to ensure all of the following:
  7 34    (1)  That the material financial condition and liquidity
  7 35 risks to members of the internationally active insurance group
  8  1 that are engaged in the business of insurance are identified
  8  2 by management.
  8  3    (2)  That reasonable and effective mitigation measures are
  8  4 in place.
  8  5    b.  Requesting, from any member of an internationally active
  8  6 insurance group subject to the commissioner's group=wide
  8  7 supervision, information necessary and appropriate to assess
  8  8 enterprise risk, including but not limited to information about
  8  9 the members of the internationally active insurance group
  8 10 regarding all of the following:
  8 11    (1)  Governance, risk assessment, and management.
  8 12    (2)  Capital adequacy.
  8 13    (3)  Material intercompany transactions.
  8 14    c.  Coordinating and, through the authority of the
  8 15 regulatory officials of the jurisdictions where members of
  8 16 the internationally active insurance group are domiciled,
  8 17 compelling the development and implementation of reasonable
  8 18 measures designed to ensure that the internationally active
  8 19 insurance group is able to timely recognize and mitigate
  8 20 enterprise risks to members of the internationally active
  8 21 insurance group that are engaged in the business of insurance.
  8 22    d.  Communicating with other state, federal, and
  8 23 international regulatory agencies for members within the
  8 24 internationally active insurance group and sharing relevant
  8 25 information, subject to the confidentiality provisions of
  8 26 section 521A.7, through supervisory colleges as set forth in
  8 27 section 521A.6A or otherwise.
  8 28    e.  Entering into agreements with or obtaining documentation
  8 29 from any insurer registered under section 521A.4, any member
  8 30 of an internationally active insurance group, and any other
  8 31 state, federal, or international regulatory agency for members
  8 32 of the internationally active insurance group, that provides
  8 33 the basis for or otherwise clarifies the commissioner's role as
  8 34 group=wide supervisor of an internationally active insurance
  8 35 group, including provisions for resolving disputes with other
  9  1 regulatory officials. Such agreements or documentation shall
  9  2 not serve as evidence in any proceeding that any insurer or
  9  3 person within an insurance company holding company system not
  9  4 domiciled or incorporated in this state is doing business in
  9  5 this state or is otherwise subject to jurisdiction in this
  9  6 state.
  9  7    f.  Other activities of group=wide supervision, consistent
  9  8 with the authority and purposes set forth in this section, as
  9  9 considered necessary by the commissioner.
  9 10    6.  If the commissioner acknowledges that another regulatory
  9 11 official from a jurisdiction that is not accredited by the
  9 12 national association of insurance commissioners is the
  9 13 group=wide supervisor of an internationally active insurance
  9 14 group, the commissioner may reasonably cooperate through a
  9 15 supervisory college or otherwise, with group=wide supervision
  9 16 undertaken by that regulatory official provided that all of the
  9 17 following occur:
  9 18    a.  The commissioner's cooperation is in compliance with the
  9 19 laws of this state.
  9 20    b.  The regulatory official acknowledged as the group=wide
  9 21 supervisor of the internationally active insurance group also
  9 22 recognizes and cooperates with the commissioner's activities
  9 23 as a group=wide supervisor for other internationally active
  9 24 insurance groups, where applicable.  If such recognition and
  9 25 cooperation is not reasonably reciprocal, the commissioner may
  9 26 refuse recognition and cooperation to that regulatory official.
  9 27    7.  The commissioner is authorized to enter into agreements
  9 28 with or obtain documentation from any insurer registered under
  9 29 section 521A.4, any affiliate of the insurer, and any other
  9 30 state, federal, or international regulatory agency for members
  9 31 of the internationally active insurance group, that provides
  9 32 the basis for or otherwise clarifies another regulatory
  9 33 official's role as group=wide supervisor of an internationally
  9 34 active insurance group.
  9 35    8.  An insurer registered under section 521A.4 that is
 10  1 subject to this section shall be liable for and shall pay the
 10  2 reasonable expenses of the commissioner's participation in
 10  3 the administration of this section, including the engagement
 10  4 of attorneys, actuaries, accountants, and other experts not
 10  5 otherwise a part of the commissioner's staff and all reasonable
 10  6 travel expenses.  Any persons so retained shall be under the
 10  7 direction and control of the commissioner and shall act in a
 10  8 purely advisory capacity.
 10  9    9.  The commissioner shall adopt rules pursuant to chapter
 10 10 17A to administer this section.
 10 11    Sec. 10.  Section 521A.7, subsection 1, Code 2016, is amended
 10 12 to read as follows:
 10 13    1.  All information, documents, and copies thereof obtained
 10 14 by or disclosed to the commissioner or any other person in
 10 15 the course of an examination or investigation made pursuant
 10 16 to section 521A.6 or 521A.6A, and all information reported
 10 17   5  2 States and in Iowa, but the commissioner has determined
  5  3 pursuant to the factors set forth in subsections 2 and 6 that
  5  4 another regulatory official is the appropriate group=wide
  5  5 supervisor.
  5  6    b.  In response to a request from an insurance holding
  5  7 company system that does not otherwise qualify as an
  5  8 internationally active insurance group, the commissioner may
  5  9 make a determination of or acknowledge a group=wide supervisor
  5 10 for such an insurance holding company system pursuant to this
  5 11 section.
  5 12    2.  a.  In cooperation with other state, federal, and
  5 13 international regulatory agencies, the commissioner shall
  5 14 identify a single group=wide supervisor for an internationally
  5 15 active insurance group.  The commissioner may determine that
  5 16 the commissioner is the appropriate group=wide supervisor
  5 17 for an internationally active insurance group that conducts
  5 18 substantial insurance operations concentrated in this state,
  5 19 or the commissioner may acknowledge that a regulatory official
  5 20 from another jurisdiction is the appropriate group=wide
  5 21 supervisor for the internationally active insurance group.  In
  5 22 making a determination or acknowledgment under this paragraph
  5 23 "a", the commissioner shall consider the following factors:
  5 24    (1)  The place of domicile of the insurers within the
  5 25 internationally active insurance group that hold the largest
  5 26 share of the group's written premiums, assets, or liabilities.
  5 27    (2)  The place of domicile of the top=tiered insurers in the
  5 28 insurance holding company system of the internationally active
  5 29 insurance group.
  5 30    (3)  The location of the executive offices or largest
  5 31 operational offices of the internationally active insurance
  5 32 group.
  5 33    (4)  Whether another regulatory official is acting as
  5 34 or is seeking to act as the group=wide supervisor of the
  5 35 internationally active insurance group under a regulatory
  6  1 system that the commissioner determines to be either of the
  6  2 following:
  6  3    (a)  Substantially similar to the system of regulation
  6  4 provided under the laws of this state.
  6  5    (b)  Otherwise sufficient in terms of providing for
  6  6 group=wide supervision, enterprise risk analysis, and
  6  7 cooperation with other regulatory officials.
  6  8    (5)  Whether another regulatory official acting as
  6  9 or seeking to act as the group=wide supervisor for the
  6 10 internationally active insurance group provides the
  6 11 commissioner with reasonably reciprocal recognition and
  6 12 cooperation.
  6 13    b.  Notwithstanding paragraph "a", even if the commissioner
  6 14 is identified pursuant to this subsection as the group=wide
  6 15 supervisor of an internationally active insurance group,
  6 16 the commissioner may determine that it is appropriate to
  6 17 acknowledge another regulatory official to serve as the
  6 18 group=wide supervisor of the internationally active insurance
  6 19 group.
  6 20    c.  The acknowledgment of a group=wide supervisor pursuant
  6 21 to this subsection shall be made after consideration of the
  6 22 factors listed in paragraph "a", subparagraphs (1) through
  6 23 (5), and shall be made in cooperation with and subject to the
  6 24 acknowledgment of other regulatory officials involved with
  6 25 supervision of members of the internationally active insurance
  6 26 group, and in consultation with the internationally active
  6 27 insurance group.
  6 28    3.  Notwithstanding any other provision of law, when another
  6 29 regulatory official is acting as the group=wide supervisor of
  6 30 an internationally active insurance group, the commissioner
  6 31 shall acknowledge that regulatory official as the group=wide
  6 32 supervisor of the internationally active insurance group.
  6 33 However, the commissioner shall make a new determination or
  6 34 acknowledgment as to the appropriate group=wide supervisor for
  6 35 the internationally active insurance group in the event that a
  7  1 material change in the internationally active insurance group
  7  2 results in either of the following:
  7  3    a.  The internationally active insurance group's insurers
  7  4 domiciled in Iowa holding the largest share of the group's
  7  5 premiums, assets, or liabilities.
  7  6    b.  Iowa being the place of domicile of the top=tiered
  7  7 insurers in the insurance holding company system of the
  7  8 internationally active insurance group.
  7  9    4.  Pursuant to section 521A.6, the commissioner is
  7 10 authorized to collect from any insurer registered pursuant to
  7 11 section 521A.4 all information necessary to determine whether
  7 12 it is appropriate for the commissioner to act as the group=wide
  7 13 supervisor of an internationally active insurance group or
  7 14 to acknowledge another regulatory official to act as the
  7 15 group=wide supervisor of the internationally active insurance
  7 16 group. Prior to issuing a determination or acknowledgment
  7 17 pursuant to this section, the commissioner shall notify the
  7 18 insurer registered pursuant to section 521A.4 and the ultimate
  7 19 controlling person within the internationally active insurance
  7 20 group of the pending determination or acknowledgment. The
  7 21 insurer and the internationally active insurance group shall
  7 22 have not less than thirty days to provide the commissioner with
  7 23 additional information pertinent to the commissioner's pending
  7 24 determination or acknowledgment. The commissioner shall
  7 25 publish the identity of the internationally active insurance
  7 26 groups that the commissioner has determined are subject to
  7 27 group=wide supervision by the commissioner.
  7 28    5.  If a determination is made that the commissioner is the
  7 29 appropriate group=wide supervisor for an internationally active
  7 30 insurance group, the commissioner is authorized to engage in
  7 31 any of the following group=wide supervision activities:
  7 32    a.  Assessing the enterprise risks within the internationally
  7 33 active insurance group to ensure all of the following:
  7 34    (1)  That the material financial condition and liquidity
  7 35 risks to members of the internationally active insurance group
  8  1 that are engaged in the business of insurance are identified
  8  2 by management.
  8  3    (2)  That reasonable and effective mitigation measures are
  8  4 in place.
  8  5    b.  Requesting, from any member of an internationally active
  8  6 insurance group subject to the commissioner's group=wide
  8  7 supervision, information necessary and appropriate to assess
  8  8 enterprise risk, including but not limited to information about
  8  9 the members of the internationally active insurance group
  8 10 regarding all of the following:
  8 11    (1)  Governance, risk assessment, and management.
  8 12    (2)  Capital adequacy.
  8 13    (3)  Material intercompany transactions.
  8 14    c.  Coordinating and, through the authority of the
  8 15 regulatory officials of the jurisdictions where members of
  8 16 the internationally active insurance group are domiciled,
  8 17 compelling the development and implementation of reasonable
  8 18 measures designed to ensure that the internationally active
  8 19 insurance group is able to timely recognize and mitigate
  8 20 enterprise risks to members of the internationally active
  8 21 insurance group that are engaged in the business of insurance.
  8 22    d.  Communicating with other state, federal, and
  8 23 international regulatory agencies for members within the
  8 24 internationally active insurance group and sharing relevant
  8 25 information, subject to the confidentiality provisions of
  8 26 section 521A.7, through supervisory colleges as set forth in
  8 27 section 521A.6A or otherwise.
  8 28    e.  Entering into agreements with or obtaining documentation
  8 29 from any insurer registered under section 521A.4, any member
  8 30 of an internationally active insurance group, and any other
  8 31 state, federal, or international regulatory agency for members
  8 32 of the internationally active insurance group, that provides
  8 33 the basis for or otherwise clarifies the commissioner's role as
  8 34 group=wide supervisor of an internationally active insurance
  8 35 group, including provisions for resolving disputes with other
  9  1 regulatory officials. Such agreements or documentation shall
  9  2 not serve as evidence in any proceeding that any insurer or
  9  3 person within an insurance company holding company system not
  9  4 domiciled or incorporated in this state is doing business in
  9  5 this state or is otherwise subject to jurisdiction in this
  9  6 state.
  9  7    f.  Other activities of group=wide supervision, consistent
  9  8 with the authority and purposes set forth in this section, as
  9  9 considered necessary by the commissioner.
  9 10    6.  If the commissioner acknowledges that another regulatory
  9 11 official from a jurisdiction that is not accredited by the
  9 12 national association of insurance commissioners is the
  9 13 group=wide supervisor of an internationally active insurance
  9 14 group, the commissioner may reasonably cooperate through a
  9 15 supervisory college or otherwise, with group=wide supervision
  9 16 undertaken by that regulatory official provided that all of the
  9 17 following occur:
  9 18    a.  The commissioner's cooperation is in compliance with the
  9 19 laws of this state.
  9 20    b.  The regulatory official acknowledged as the group=wide
  9 21 supervisor of the internationally active insurance group also
  9 22 recognizes and cooperates with the commissioner's activities
  9 23 as a group=wide supervisor for other internationally active
  9 24 insurance groups, where applicable.  If such recognition and
  9 25 cooperation is not reasonably reciprocal, the commissioner may
  9 26 refuse recognition and cooperation to that regulatory official.
  9 27    7.  The commissioner is authorized to enter into agreements
  9 28 with or obtain documentation from any insurer registered under
  9 29 section 521A.4, any affiliate of the insurer, and any other
  9 30 state, federal, or international regulatory agency for members
  9 31 of the internationally active insurance group, that provides
  9 32 the basis for or otherwise clarifies another regulatory
  9 33 official's role as group=wide supervisor of an internationally
  9 34 active insurance group.
  9 35    8.  An insurer registered under section 521A.4 that is
 10  1 subject to this section shall be liable for and shall pay the
 10  2 reasonable expenses of the commissioner's participation in
 10  3 the administration of this section, including the engagement
 10  4 of attorneys, actuaries, accountants, and other experts not
 10  5 otherwise a part of the commissioner's staff and all reasonable
 10  6 travel expenses.  Any persons so retained shall be under the
 10  7 direction and control of the commissioner and shall act in a
 10  8 purely advisory capacity.
 10  9    9.  The commissioner shall adopt rules pursuant to chapter
 10 10 17A to administer this section.
 10 11    Sec. 10.  Section 521A.7, subsection 1, Code 2016, is amended
 10 12 to read as follows:
 10 13    1.  All information, documents, and copies thereof obtained
 10 14 by or disclosed to the commissioner or any other person in
 10 15 the course of an examination or investigation made pursuant
 10 16 to section 521A.6 or 521A.6A, and all information reported
 10 17   5  3 pursuant to the factors set forth in subsections 2 and 6 that
  5  4 another regulatory official is the appropriate group=wide
  5  5 supervisor.
  5  6    b.  In response to a request from an insurance holding
  5  7 company system that does not otherwise qualify as an
  5  8 internationally active insurance group, the commissioner may
  5  9 make a determination of or acknowledge a group=wide supervisor
  5 10 for such an insurance holding company system pursuant to this
  5 11 section.
  5 12    2.  a.  In cooperation with other state, federal, and
  5 13 international regulatory agencies, the commissioner shall
  5 14 identify a single group=wide supervisor for an internationally
  5 15 active insurance group.  The commissioner may determine that
  5 16 the commissioner is the appropriate group=wide supervisor
  5 17 for an internationally active insurance group that conducts
  5 18 substantial insurance operations concentrated in this state,
  5 19 or the commissioner may acknowledge that a regulatory official
  5 20 from another jurisdiction is the appropriate group=wide
  5 21 supervisor for the internationally active insurance group.  In
  5 22 making a determination or acknowledgment under this paragraph
  5 23 "a", the commissioner shall consider the following factors:
  5 24    (1)  The place of domicile of the insurers within the
  5 25 internationally active insurance group that hold the largest
  5 26 share of the group's written premiums, assets, or liabilities.
  5 27    (2)  The place of domicile of the top=tiered insurers in the
  5 28 insurance holding company system of the internationally active
  5 29 insurance group.
  5 30    (3)  The location of the executive offices or largest
  5 31 operational offices of the internationally active insurance
  5 32 group.
  5 33    (4)  Whether another regulatory official is acting as
  5 34 or is seeking to act as the group=wide supervisor of the
  5 35 internationally active insurance group under a regulatory
  6  1 system that the commissioner determines to be either of the
  6  2 following:
  6  3    (a)  Substantially similar to the system of regulation
  6  4 provided under the laws of this state.
  6  5    (b)  Otherwise sufficient in terms of providing for
  6  6 group=wide supervision, enterprise risk analysis, and
  6  7 cooperation with other regulatory officials.
  6  8    (5)  Whether another regulatory official acting as
  6  9 or seeking to act as the group=wide supervisor for the
  6 10 internationally active insurance group provides the
  6 11 commissioner with reasonably reciprocal recognition and
  6 12 cooperation.
  6 13    b.  Notwithstanding paragraph "a", even if the commissioner

  6 16 the commissioner may determine that it is appropriate to
  6 17 acknowledge another regulatory official to serve as the
  6 18 group=wide supervisor of the internationally active insurance
  6 19 group.
  6 20    c.  The acknowledgment of a group=wide supervisor pursuant
  6 21 to this subsection shall be made after consideration of the
  6 22 factors listed in paragraph "a", subparagraphs (1) through
  6 23 (5), and shall be made in cooperation with and subject to the
  6 24 acknowledgment of other regulatory officials involved with
  6 25 supervision of members of the internationally active insurance
  6 26 group, and in consultation with the internationally active
  6 27 insurance group.
  6 28    3.  Notwithstanding any other provision of law, when another
  6 29 regulatory official is acting as the group=wide supervisor of
  6 30 an internationally active insurance group, the commissioner
  6 31 shall acknowledge that regulatory official as the group=wide
  6 32 supervisor of the internationally active insurance group.
  6 33 However, the commissioner shall make a new determination or
  6 34 acknowledgment as to the appropriate group=wide supervisor for
  6 35 the internationally active insurance group in the event that a
  7  1 material change in the internationally active insurance group
  7  2 results in either of the following:
  7  3    a.  The internationally active insurance group's insurers
  7  4 domiciled in Iowa holding the largest share of the group's
  7  5 premiums, assets, or liabilities.

  7 13 supervisor of an internationally active insurance group or
  7 14 to acknowledge another regulatory official to act as the
  7 15 group=wide supervisor of the internationally active insurance
  7 16 group. Prior to issuing a determination or acknowledgment
  7 17 pursuant to this section, the commissioner shall notify the
  7 18 insurer registered pursuant to section 521A.4 and the ultimate
  7 19 controlling person within the internationally active insurance

  7 21 insurer and the internationally active insurance group shall
  7 22 have not less than thirty days to provide the commissioner with
  7 23 additional information pertinent to the commissioner's pending
  7 24 determination or acknowledgment. The commissioner shall
  7 25 publish the identity of the internationally active insurance
  7 26 groups that the commissioner has determined are subject to
  7 27 group=wide supervision by the commissioner.
  7 28    5.  If a determination is made that the commissioner is the
  7 29 appropriate group=wide supervisor for an internationally active
  7 30 insurance group, the commissioner is authorized to engage in
  7 31 any of the following group=wide supervision activities:
  7 32    a.  Assessing the enterprise risks within the internationally
  7 33 active insurance group to ensure all of the following:
  7 34    (1)  That the material financial condition and liquidity
  7 35 risks to members of the internationally active insurance group
  8  1 that are engaged in the business of insurance are identified
  8  2 by management.
  8  3    (2)  That reasonable and effective mitigation measures are
  8  4 in place.
  8  5    b.  Requesting, from any member of an internationally active
  8  6 insurance group subject to the commissioner's group=wide
  8  7 supervision, information necessary and appropriate to assess
  8  8 enterprise risk, including but not limited to information about
  8  9 the members of the internationally active insurance group
  8 10 regarding all of the following:
  8 11    (1)  Governance, risk assessment, and management.
  8 12    (2)  Capital adequacy.
  8 13    (3)  Material intercompany transactions.
  8 14    c.  Coordinating and, through the authority of the
  8 15 regulatory officials of the jurisdictions where members of
  8 16 the internationally active insurance group are domiciled,
  8 17 compelling the development and implementation of reasonable
  8 18 measures designed to ensure that the internationally active
  8 19 insurance group is able to timely recognize and mitigate
  8 20 enterprise risks to members of the internationally active
  8 21 insurance group that are engaged in the business of insurance.
  8 22    d.  Communicating with other state, federal, and
  8 23 international regulatory agencies for members within the
  8 24 internationally active insurance group and sharing relevant
  8 25 information, subject to the confidentiality provisions of
  8 26 section 521A.7, through supervisory colleges as set forth in
  8 27 section 521A.6A or otherwise.
  8 28    e.  Entering into agreements with or obtaining documentation
  8 29 from any insurer registered under section 521A.4, any member
  8 30 of an internationally active insurance group, and any other
  8 31 state, federal, or international regulatory agency for members
  8 32 of the internationally active insurance group, that provides
  8 33 the basis for or otherwise clarifies the commissioner's role as
  8 34 group=wide supervisor of an internationally active insurance
  8 35 group, including provisions for resolving disputes with other
  9  1 regulatory officials. Such agreements or documentation shall
  9  2 not serve as evidence in any proceeding that any insurer or
  9  3 person within an insurance company holding company system not
  9  4 domiciled or incorporated in this state is doing business in
  9  5 this state or is otherwise subject to jurisdiction in this
  9  6 state.
  9  7    f.  Other activities of group=wide supervision, consistent
  9  8 with the authority and purposes set forth in this section, as
  9  9 considered necessary by the commissioner.
  9 10    6.  If the commissioner acknowledges that another regulatory
  9 11 official from a jurisdiction that is not accredited by the
  9 12 national association of insurance commissioners is the
  9 13 group=wide supervisor of an internationally active insurance
  9 14 group, the commissioner may reasonably cooperate through a
  9 15 supervisory college or otherwise, with group=wide supervision
  9 16 undertaken by that regulatory official provided that all of the
  9 17 following occur:
  9 18    a.  The commissioner's cooperation is in compliance with the
  9 19 laws of this state.
  9 20    b.  The regulatory official acknowledged as the group=wide
  9 21 supervisor of the internationally active insurance group also
  9 22 recognizes and cooperates with the commissioner's activities
  9 23 as a group=wide supervisor for other internationally active
  9 24 insurance groups, where applicable.  If such recognition and
  9 25 cooperation is not reasonably reciprocal, the commissioner may
  9 26 refuse recognition and cooperation to that regulatory official.
  9 27    7.  The commissioner is authorized to enter into agreements
  9 28 with or obtain documentation from any insurer registered under
  9 29 section 521A.4, any affiliate of the insurer, and any other
  9 30 state, federal, or international regulatory agency for members
  9 31 of the internationally active insurance group, that provides
  9 32 the basis for or otherwise clarifies another regulatory
  9 33 official's role as group=wide supervisor of an internationally
  9 34 active insurance group.
  9 35    8.  An insurer registered under section 521A.4 that is
 10  1 subject to this section shall be liable for and shall pay the
 10  2 reasonable expenses of the commissioner's participation in
 10  3 the administration of this section, including the engagement
 10  4 of attorneys, actuaries, accountants, and other experts not
 10  5 otherwise a part of the commissioner's staff and all reasonable
 10  6 travel expenses.  Any persons so retained shall be under the
 10  7 direction and control of the commissioner and shall act in a
 10  8 purely advisory capacity.
 10  9    9.  The commissioner shall adopt rules pursuant to chapter
 10 10 17A to administer this section.
 10 11    Sec. 10.  Section 521A.7, subsection 1, Code 2016, is amended
 10 12 to read as follows:
 10 13    1.  All information, documents, and copies thereof obtained
 10 14 by or disclosed to the commissioner or any other person in
 10 15 the course of an examination or investigation made pursuant
 10 16 to section 521A.6 or 521A.6A, and all information reported
 10 17   5  4 another regulatory official is the appropriate group=wide
  5  5 supervisor.
  5  6    b.  In response to a request from an insurance holding
  5  7 company system that does not otherwise qualify as an
  5  8 internationally active insurance group, the commissioner may
  5  9 make a determination of or acknowledge a group=wide supervisor
  5 10 for such an insurance holding company system pursuant to this
  5 11 section.
  5 12    2.  a.  In cooperation with other state, federal, and
  5 13 international regulatory agencies, the commissioner shall
  5 14 identify a single group=wide supervisor for an internationally
  5 15 active insurance group.  The commissioner may determine that
  5 16 the commissioner is the appropriate group=wide supervisor
  5 17 for an internationally active insurance group that conducts
  5 18 substantial insurance operations concentrated in this state,
  5 19 or the commissioner may acknowledge that a regulatory official
  5 20 from another jurisdiction is the appropriate group=wide
  5 21 supervisor for the internationally active insurance group.  In
  5 22 making a determination or acknowledgment under this paragraph
  5 23 "a", the commissioner shall consider the following factors:
  5 24    (1)  The place of domicile of the insurers within the
  5 25 internationally active insurance group that hold the largest
  5 26 share of the group's written premiums, assets, or liabilities.
  5 27    (2)  The place of domicile of the top=tiered insurers in the
  5 28 insurance holding company system of the internationally active
  5 29 insurance group.
  5 30    (3)  The location of the executive offices or largest
  5 31 operational offices of the internationally active insurance
  5 32 group.
  5 33    (4)  Whether another regulatory official is acting as
  5 34 or is seeking to act as the group=wide supervisor of the
  5 35 internationally active insurance group under a regulatory
  6  1 system that the commissioner determines to be either of the
  6  2 following:
  6  3    (a)  Substantially similar to the system of regulation
  6  4 provided under the laws of this state.
  6  5    (b)  Otherwise sufficient in terms of providing for
  6  6 group=wide supervision, enterprise risk analysis, and
  6  7 cooperation with other regulatory officials.
  6  8    (5)  Whether another regulatory official acting as
  6  9 or seeking to act as the group=wide supervisor for the
  6 10 internationally active insurance group provides the
  6 11 commissioner with reasonably reciprocal recognition and
  6 12 cooperation.
  6 13    b.  Notwithstanding paragraph "a", even if the commissioner
  6 14 is identified pursuant to this subsection as the group=wide
  6 15 supervisor of an internationally active insurance group,
  6 16 the commissioner may determine that it is appropriate to
  6 17 acknowledge another regulatory official to serve as the
  6 18 group=wide supervisor of the internationally active insurance
  6 19 group.
  6 20    c.  The acknowledgment of a group=wide supervisor pursuant
  6 21 to this subsection shall be made after consideration of the
  6 22 factors listed in paragraph "a", subparagraphs (1) through
  6 23 (5), and shall be made in cooperation with and subject to the
  6 24 acknowledgment of other regulatory officials involved with
  6 25 supervision of members of the internationally active insurance
  6 26 group, and in consultation with the internationally active
  6 27 insurance group.
  6 28    3.  Notwithstanding any other provision of law, when another
  6 29 regulatory official is acting as the group=wide supervisor of
  6 30 an internationally active insurance group, the commissioner
  6 31 shall acknowledge that regulatory official as the group=wide
  6 32 supervisor of the internationally active insurance group.
  6 33 However, the commissioner shall make a new determination or
  6 34 acknowledgment as to the appropriate group=wide supervisor for
  6 35 the internationally active insurance group in the event that a
  7  1 material change in the internationally active insurance group
  7  2 results in either of the following:
  7  3    a.  The internationally active insurance group's insurers
  7  4 domiciled in Iowa holding the largest share of the group's
  7  5 premiums, assets, or liabilities.
  7  6    b.  Iowa being the place of domicile of the top=tiered
  7  7 insurers in the insurance holding company system of the
  7  8 internationally active insurance group.
  7  9    4.  Pursuant to section 521A.6, the commissioner is
  7 10 authorized to collect from any insurer registered pursuant to
  7 11 section 521A.4 all information necessary to determine whether
  7 12 it is appropriate for the commissioner to act as the group=wide
  7 13 supervisor of an internationally active insurance group or
  7 14 to acknowledge another regulatory official to act as the
  7 15 group=wide supervisor of the internationally active insurance
  7 16 group. Prior to issuing a determination or acknowledgment
  7 17 pursuant to this section, the commissioner shall notify the
  7 18 insurer registered pursuant to section 521A.4 and the ultimate
  7 19 controlling person within the internationally active insurance
  7 20 group of the pending determination or acknowledgment. The
  7 21 insurer and the internationally active insurance group shall
  7 22 have not less than thirty days to provide the commissioner with
  7 23 additional information pertinent to the commissioner's pending
  7 24 determination or acknowledgment. The commissioner shall
  7 25 publish the identity of the internationally active insurance
  7 26 groups that the commissioner has determined are subject to
  7 27 group=wide supervision by the commissioner.
  7 28    5.  If a determination is made that the commissioner is the
  7 29 appropriate group=wide supervisor for an internationally active
  7 30 insurance group, the commissioner is authorized to engage in
  7 31 any of the following group=wide supervision activities:
  7 32    a.  Assessing the enterprise risks within the internationally
  7 33 active insurance group to ensure all of the following:
  7 34    (1)  That the material financial condition and liquidity
  7 35 risks to members of the internationally active insurance group
  8  1 that are engaged in the business of insurance are identified
  8  2 by management.
  8  3    (2)  That reasonable and effective mitigation measures are
  8  4 in place.
  8  5    b.  Requesting, from any member of an internationally active
  8  6 insurance group subject to the commissioner's group=wide
  8  7 supervision, information necessary and appropriate to assess
  8  8 enterprise risk, including but not limited to information about
  8  9 the members of the internationally active insurance group
  8 10 regarding all of the following:
  8 11    (1)  Governance, risk assessment, and management.
  8 12    (2)  Capital adequacy.
  8 13    (3)  Material intercompany transactions.
  8 14    c.  Coordinating and, through the authority of the
  8 15 regulatory officials of the jurisdictions where members of
  8 16 the internationally active insurance group are domiciled,
  8 17 compelling the development and implementation of reasonable
  8 18 measures designed to ensure that the internationally active
  8 19 insurance group is able to timely recognize and mitigate
  8 20 enterprise risks to members of the internationally active
  8 21 insurance group that are engaged in the business of insurance.
  8 22    d.  Communicating with other state, federal, and
  8 23 international regulatory agencies for members within the
  8 24 internationally active insurance group and sharing relevant
  8 25 information, subject to the confidentiality provisions of
  8 26 section 521A.7, through supervisory colleges as set forth in
  8 27 section 521A.6A or otherwise.
  8 28    e.  Entering into agreements with or obtaining documentation
  8 29 from any insurer registered under section 521A.4, any member
  8 30 of an internationally active insurance group, and any other
  8 31 state, federal, or international regulatory agency for members
  8 32 of the internationally active insurance group, that provides
  8 33 the basis for or otherwise clarifies the commissioner's role as
  8 34 group=wide supervisor of an internationally active insurance
  8 35 group, including provisions for resolving disputes with other
  9  1 regulatory officials. Such agreements or documentation shall
  9  2 not serve as evidence in any proceeding that any insurer or
  9  3 person within an insurance company holding company system not
  9  4 domiciled or incorporated in this state is doing business in
  9  5 this state or is otherwise subject to jurisdiction in this
  9  6 state.
  9  7    f.  Other activities of group=wide supervision, consistent
  9  8 with the authority and purposes set forth in this section, as
  9  9 considered necessary by the commissioner.
  9 10    6.  If the commissioner acknowledges that another regulatory
  9 11 official from a jurisdiction that is not accredited by the
  9 12 national association of insurance commissioners is the
  9 13 group=wide supervisor of an internationally active insurance
  9 14 group, the commissioner may reasonably cooperate through a
  9 15 supervisory college or otherwise, with group=wide supervision
  9 16 undertaken by that regulatory official provided that all of the
  9 17 following occur:
  9 18    a.  The commissioner's cooperation is in compliance with the
  9 19 laws of this state.
  9 20    b.  The regulatory official acknowledged as the group=wide
  9 21 supervisor of the internationally active insurance group also
  9 22 recognizes and cooperates with the commissioner's activities
  9 23 as a group=wide supervisor for other internationally active
  9 24 insurance groups, where applicable.  If such recognition and
  9 25 cooperation is not reasonably reciprocal, the commissioner may
  9 26 refuse recognition and cooperation to that regulatory official.
  9 27    7.  The commissioner is authorized to enter into agreements
  9 28 with or obtain documentation from any insurer registered under
  9 29 section 521A.4, any affiliate of the insurer, and any other
  9 30 state, federal, or international regulatory agency for members
  9 31 of the internationally active insurance group, that provides
  9 32 the basis for or otherwise clarifies another regulatory
  9 33 official's role as group=wide supervisor of an internationally
  9 34 active insurance group.
  9 35    8.  An insurer registered under section 521A.4 that is
 10  1 subject to this section shall be liable for and shall pay the
 10  2 reasonable expenses of the commissioner's participation in
 10  3 the administration of this section, including the engagement
 10  4 of attorneys, actuaries, accountants, and other experts not
 10  5 otherwise a part of the commissioner's staff and all reasonable
 10  6 travel expenses.  Any persons so retained shall be under the
 10  7 direction and control of the commissioner and shall act in a
 10  8 purely advisory capacity.
 10  9    9.  The commissioner shall adopt rules pursuant to chapter
 10 10 17A to administer this section.
 10 11    Sec. 10.  Section 521A.7, subsection 1, Code 2016, is amended
 10 12 to read as follows:
 10 13    1.  All information, documents, and copies thereof obtained
 10 14 by or disclosed to the commissioner or any other person in
 10 15 the course of an examination or investigation made pursuant

 10 17   5  5 supervisor.
  5  6    b.  In response to a request from an insurance holding
  5  7 company system that does not otherwise qualify as an
  5  8 internationally active insurance group, the commissioner may
  5  9 make a determination of or acknowledge a group=wide supervisor
  5 10 for such an insurance holding company system pursuant to this
  5 11 section.
  5 12    2.  a.  In cooperation with other state, federal, and
  5 13 international regulatory agencies, the commissioner shall

  5 15 active insurance group.  The commissioner may determine that
  5 16 the commissioner is the appropriate group=wide supervisor
  5 17 for an internationally active insurance group that conducts
  5 18 substantial insurance operations concentrated in this state,
  5 19 or the commissioner may acknowledge that a regulatory official
  5 20 from another jurisdiction is the appropriate group=wide
  5 21 supervisor for the internationally active insurance group.  In
  5 22 making a determination or acknowledgment under this paragraph
  5 23 "a", the commissioner shall consider the following factors:
  5 24    (1)  The place of domicile of the insurers within the
  5 25 internationally active insurance group that hold the largest
  5 26 share of the group's written premiums, assets, or liabilities.

  5 28 insurance holding company system of the internationally active
  5 29 insurance group.
  5 30    (3)  The location of the executive offices or largest
  5 31 operational offices of the internationally active insurance
  5 32 group.
  5 33    (4)  Whether another regulatory official is acting as
  5 34 or is seeking to act as the group=wide supervisor of the
  5 35 internationally active insurance group under a regulatory
  6  1 system that the commissioner determines to be either of the
  6  2 following:
  6  3    (a)  Substantially similar to the system of regulation
  6  4 provided under the laws of this state.
  6  5    (b)  Otherwise sufficient in terms of providing for
  6  6 group=wide supervision, enterprise risk analysis, and
  6  7 cooperation with other regulatory officials.
  6  8    (5)  Whether another regulatory official acting as
  6  9 or seeking to act as the group=wide supervisor for the
  6 10 internationally active insurance group provides the
  6 11 commissioner with reasonably reciprocal recognition and
  6 12 cooperation.
  6 13    b.  Notwithstanding paragraph "a", even if the commissioner

  6 19 group.
  6 20    c.  The acknowledgment of a group=wide supervisor pursuant
  6 21 to this subsection shall be made after consideration of the
  6 22 factors listed in paragraph "a", subparagraphs (1) through
  6 23 (5), and shall be made in cooperation with and subject to the
  6 24 acknowledgment of other regulatory officials involved with
  6 25 supervision of members of the internationally active insurance
  6 26 group, and in consultation with the internationally active
  6 27 insurance group.
  6 28    3.  Notwithstanding any other provision of law, when another
  6 29 regulatory official is acting as the group=wide supervisor of
  6 30 an internationally active insurance group, the commissioner
  6 31 shall acknowledge that regulatory official as the group=wide
  6 32 supervisor of the internationally active insurance group.
  6 33 However, the commissioner shall make a new determination or
  6 34 acknowledgment as to the appropriate group=wide supervisor for
  6 35 the internationally active insurance group in the event that a
  7  1 material change in the internationally active insurance group
  7  2 results in either of the following:
  7  3    a.  The internationally active insurance group's insurers
  7  4 domiciled in Iowa holding the largest share of the group's
  7  5 premiums, assets, or liabilities.

  7 26 groups that the commissioner has determined are subject to
  7 27 group=wide supervision by the commissioner.
  7 28    5.  If a determination is made that the commissioner is the

 10 13    1.  All information, documents, and copies thereof obtained
 10 14 by or disclosed to the commissioner or any other person in

 10 16 to section 521A.6 or 521A.6A, and all information reported
 10 17   5  6    b.  In response to a request from an insurance holding
  5  7 company system that does not otherwise qualify as an
  5  8 internationally active insurance group, the commissioner may
  5  9 make a determination of or acknowledge a group=wide supervisor
  5 10 for such an insurance holding company system pursuant to this

  5 12    2.  a.  In cooperation with other state, federal, and
  5 13 international regulatory agencies, the commissioner shall

  5 34 or is seeking to act as the group=wide supervisor of the
  5 35 internationally active insurance group under a regulatory
  6  1 system that the commissioner determines to be either of the
  6  2 following:
  6  3    (a)  Substantially similar to the system of regulation
  6  4 provided under the laws of this state.
  6  5    (b)  Otherwise sufficient in terms of providing for
  6  6 group=wide supervision, enterprise risk analysis, and
  6  7 cooperation with other regulatory officials.
  6  8    (5)  Whether another regulatory official acting as
  6  9 or seeking to act as the group=wide supervisor for the
  6 10 internationally active insurance group provides the
  6 11 commissioner with reasonably reciprocal recognition and
  6 12 cooperation.
  6 13    b.  Notwithstanding paragraph "a", even if the commissioner
  6 14 is identified pursuant to this subsection as the group=wide
  6 15 supervisor of an internationally active insurance group,
  6 16 the commissioner may determine that it is appropriate to
  6 17 acknowledge another regulatory official to serve as the
  6 18 group=wide supervisor of the internationally active insurance
  6 19 group.
  6 20    c.  The acknowledgment of a group=wide supervisor pursuant
  6 21 to this subsection shall be made after consideration of the
  6 22 factors listed in paragraph "a", subparagraphs (1) through
  6 23 (5), and shall be made in cooperation with and subject to the
  6 24 acknowledgment of other regulatory officials involved with
  6 25 supervision of members of the internationally active insurance
  6 26 group, and in consultation with the internationally active
  6 27 insurance group.
  6 28    3.  Notwithstanding any other provision of law, when another
  6 29 regulatory official is acting as the group=wide supervisor of
  6 30 an internationally active insurance group, the commissioner
  6 31 shall acknowledge that regulatory official as the group=wide
  6 32 supervisor of the internationally active insurance group.
  6 33 However, the commissioner shall make a new determination or
  6 34 acknowledgment as to the appropriate group=wide supervisor for
  6 35 the internationally active insurance group in the event that a
  7  1 material change in the internationally active insurance group
  7  2 results in either of the following:
  7  3    a.  The internationally active insurance group's insurers
  7  4 domiciled in Iowa holding the largest share of the group's
  7  5 premiums, assets, or liabilities.
  7  6    b.  Iowa being the place of domicile of the top=tiered
  7  7 insurers in the insurance holding company system of the
  7  8 internationally active insurance group.
  7  9    4.  Pursuant to section 521A.6, the commissioner is
  7 10 authorized to collect from any insurer registered pursuant to
  7 11 section 521A.4 all information necessary to determine whether
  7 12 it is appropriate for the commissioner to act as the group=wide
  7 13 supervisor of an internationally active insurance group or
  7 14 to acknowledge another regulatory official to act as the
  7 15 group=wide supervisor of the internationally active insurance
  7 16 group. Prior to issuing a determination or acknowledgment
  7 17 pursuant to this section, the commissioner shall notify the
  7 18 insurer registered pursuant to section 521A.4 and the ultimate
  7 19 controlling person within the internationally active insurance
  7 20 group of the pending determination or acknowledgment. The
  7 21 insurer and the internationally active insurance group shall
  7 22 have not less than thirty days to provide the commissioner with
  7 23 additional information pertinent to the commissioner's pending
  7 24 determination or acknowledgment. The commissioner shall
  7 25 publish the identity of the internationally active insurance
  7 26 groups that the commissioner has determined are subject to
  7 27 group=wide supervision by the commissioner.
  7 28    5.  If a determination is made that the commissioner is the
  7 29 appropriate group=wide supervisor for an internationally active
  7 30 insurance group, the commissioner is authorized to engage in
  7 31 any of the following group=wide supervision activities:
  7 32    a.  Assessing the enterprise risks within the internationally
  7 33 active insurance group to ensure all of the following:
  7 34    (1)  That the material financial condition and liquidity
  7 35 risks to members of the internationally active insurance group
  8  1 that are engaged in the business of insurance are identified
  8  2 by management.
  8  3    (2)  That reasonable and effective mitigation measures are
  8  4 in place.
  8  5    b.  Requesting, from any member of an internationally active
  8  6 insurance group subject to the commissioner's group=wide
  8  7 supervision, information necessary and appropriate to assess
  8  8 enterprise risk, including but not limited to information about
  8  9 the members of the internationally active insurance group
  8 10 regarding all of the following:
  8 11    (1)  Governance, risk assessment, and management.
  8 12    (2)  Capital adequacy.
  8 13    (3)  Material intercompany transactions.
  8 14    c.  Coordinating and, through the authority of the
  8 15 regulatory officials of the jurisdictions where members of
  8 16 the internationally active insurance group are domiciled,
  8 17 compelling the development and implementation of reasonable
  8 18 measures designed to ensure that the internationally active
  8 19 insurance group is able to timely recognize and mitigate
  8 20 enterprise risks to members of the internationally active
  8 21 insurance group that are engaged in the business of insurance.
  8 22    d.  Communicating with other state, federal, and
  8 23 international regulatory agencies for members within the
  8 24 internationally active insurance group and sharing relevant
  8 25 information, subject to the confidentiality provisions of
  8 26 section 521A.7, through supervisory colleges as set forth in
  8 27 section 521A.6A or otherwise.
  8 28    e.  Entering into agreements with or obtaining documentation
  8 29 from any insurer registered under section 521A.4, any member
  8 30 of an internationally active insurance group, and any other
  8 31 state, federal, or international regulatory agency for members
  8 32 of the internationally active insurance group, that provides
  8 33 the basis for or otherwise clarifies the commissioner's role as
  8 34 group=wide supervisor of an internationally active insurance
  8 35 group, including provisions for resolving disputes with other
  9  1 regulatory officials. Such agreements or documentation shall
  9  2 not serve as evidence in any proceeding that any insurer or
  9  3 person within an insurance company holding company system not
  9  4 domiciled or incorporated in this state is doing business in
  9  5 this state or is otherwise subject to jurisdiction in this
  9  6 state.
  9  7    f.  Other activities of group=wide supervision, consistent
  9  8 with the authority and purposes set forth in this section, as
  9  9 considered necessary by the commissioner.
  9 10    6.  If the commissioner acknowledges that another regulatory
  9 11 official from a jurisdiction that is not accredited by the
  9 12 national association of insurance commissioners is the
  9 13 group=wide supervisor of an internationally active insurance
  9 14 group, the commissioner may reasonably cooperate through a
  9 15 supervisory college or otherwise, with group=wide supervision
  9 16 undertaken by that regulatory official provided that all of the
  9 17 following occur:
  9 18    a.  The commissioner's cooperation is in compliance with the
  9 19 laws of this state.
  9 20    b.  The regulatory official acknowledged as the group=wide
  9 21 supervisor of the internationally active insurance group also
  9 22 recognizes and cooperates with the commissioner's activities
  9 23 as a group=wide supervisor for other internationally active
  9 24 insurance groups, where applicable.  If such recognition and
  9 25 cooperation is not reasonably reciprocal, the commissioner may
  9 26 refuse recognition and cooperation to that regulatory official.
  9 27    7.  The commissioner is authorized to enter into agreements
  9 28 with or obtain documentation from any insurer registered under
  9 29 section 521A.4, any affiliate of the insurer, and any other
  9 30 state, federal, or international regulatory agency for members
  9 31 of the internationally active insurance group, that provides
  9 32 the basis for or otherwise clarifies another regulatory
  9 33 official's role as group=wide supervisor of an internationally
  9 34 active insurance group.
  9 35    8.  An insurer registered under section 521A.4 that is
 10  1 subject to this section shall be liable for and shall pay the
 10  2 reasonable expenses of the commissioner's participation in
 10  3 the administration of this section, including the engagement
 10  4 of attorneys, actuaries, accountants, and other experts not
 10  5 otherwise a part of the commissioner's staff and all reasonable
 10  6 travel expenses.  Any persons so retained shall be under the
 10  7 direction and control of the commissioner and shall act in a
 10  8 purely advisory capacity.
 10  9    9.  The commissioner shall adopt rules pursuant to chapter
 10 10 17A to administer this section.
 10 11    Sec. 10.  Section 521A.7, subsection 1, Code 2016, is amended
 10 12 to read as follows:
 10 13    1.  All information, documents, and copies thereof obtained
 10 14 by or disclosed to the commissioner or any other person in
 10 15 the course of an examination or investigation made pursuant
 10 16 to section 521A.6 or 521A.6A, and all information reported
 10 17   5  7 company system that does not otherwise qualify as an
  5  8 internationally active insurance group, the commissioner may
  5  9 make a determination of or acknowledge a group=wide supervisor
  5 10 for such an insurance holding company system pursuant to this
  5 11 section.
  5 12    2.  a.  In cooperation with other state, federal, and
  5 13 international regulatory agencies, the commissioner shall
  5 14 identify a single group=wide supervisor for an internationally
  5 15 active insurance group.  The commissioner may determine that
  5 16 the commissioner is the appropriate group=wide supervisor
  5 17 for an internationally active insurance group that conducts
  5 18 substantial insurance operations concentrated in this state,
  5 19 or the commissioner may acknowledge that a regulatory official
  5 20 from another jurisdiction is the appropriate group=wide
  5 21 supervisor for the internationally active insurance group.  In
  5 22 making a determination or acknowledgment under this paragraph
  5 23 "a", the commissioner shall consider the following factors:
  5 24    (1)  The place of domicile of the insurers within the
  5 25 internationally active insurance group that hold the largest
  5 26 share of the group's written premiums, assets, or liabilities.
  5 27    (2)  The place of domicile of the top=tiered insurers in the
  5 28 insurance holding company system of the internationally active
  5 29 insurance group.
  5 30    (3)  The location of the executive offices or largest
  5 31 operational offices of the internationally active insurance
  5 32 group.
  5 33    (4)  Whether another regulatory official is acting as
  5 34 or is seeking to act as the group=wide supervisor of the
  5 35 internationally active insurance group under a regulatory
  6  1 system that the commissioner determines to be either of the
  6  2 following:
  6  3    (a)  Substantially similar to the system of regulation
  6  4 provided under the laws of this state.
  6  5    (b)  Otherwise sufficient in terms of providing for
  6  6 group=wide supervision, enterprise risk analysis, and
  6  7 cooperation with other regulatory officials.
  6  8    (5)  Whether another regulatory official acting as
  6  9 or seeking to act as the group=wide supervisor for the
  6 10 internationally active insurance group provides the
  6 11 commissioner with reasonably reciprocal recognition and
  6 12 cooperation.
  6 13    b.  Notwithstanding paragraph "a", even if the commissioner
  6 14 is identified pursuant to this subsection as the group=wide
  6 15 supervisor of an internationally active insurance group,
  6 16 the commissioner may determine that it is appropriate to
  6 17 acknowledge another regulatory official to serve as the
  6 18 group=wide supervisor of the internationally active insurance
  6 19 group.
  6 20    c.  The acknowledgment of a group=wide supervisor pursuant
  6 21 to this subsection shall be made after consideration of the
  6 22 factors listed in paragraph "a", subparagraphs (1) through
  6 23 (5), and shall be made in cooperation with and subject to the
  6 24 acknowledgment of other regulatory officials involved with
  6 25 supervision of members of the internationally active insurance
  6 26 group, and in consultation with the internationally active
  6 27 insurance group.
  6 28    3.  Notwithstanding any other provision of law, when another
  6 29 regulatory official is acting as the group=wide supervisor of
  6 30 an internationally active insurance group, the commissioner
  6 31 shall acknowledge that regulatory official as the group=wide
  6 32 supervisor of the internationally active insurance group.
  6 33 However, the commissioner shall make a new determination or
  6 34 acknowledgment as to the appropriate group=wide supervisor for
  6 35 the internationally active insurance group in the event that a
  7  1 material change in the internationally active insurance group
  7  2 results in either of the following:
  7  3    a.  The internationally active insurance group's insurers
  7  4 domiciled in Iowa holding the largest share of the group's
  7  5 premiums, assets, or liabilities.
  7  6    b.  Iowa being the place of domicile of the top=tiered
  7  7 insurers in the insurance holding company system of the
  7  8 internationally active insurance group.
  7  9    4.  Pursuant to section 521A.6, the commissioner is
  7 10 authorized to collect from any insurer registered pursuant to
  7 11 section 521A.4 all information necessary to determine whether
  7 12 it is appropriate for the commissioner to act as the group=wide
  7 13 supervisor of an internationally active insurance group or
  7 14 to acknowledge another regulatory official to act as the
  7 15 group=wide supervisor of the internationally active insurance
  7 16 group. Prior to issuing a determination or acknowledgment
  7 17 pursuant to this section, the commissioner shall notify the
  7 18 insurer registered pursuant to section 521A.4 and the ultimate
  7 19 controlling person within the internationally active insurance
  7 20 group of the pending determination or acknowledgment. The
  7 21 insurer and the internationally active insurance group shall
  7 22 have not less than thirty days to provide the commissioner with
  7 23 additional information pertinent to the commissioner's pending
  7 24 determination or acknowledgment. The commissioner shall
  7 25 publish the identity of the internationally active insurance
  7 26 groups that the commissioner has determined are subject to
  7 27 group=wide supervision by the commissioner.
  7 28    5.  If a determination is made that the commissioner is the
  7 29 appropriate group=wide supervisor for an internationally active
  7 30 insurance group, the commissioner is authorized to engage in
  7 31 any of the following group=wide supervision activities:
  7 32    a.  Assessing the enterprise risks within the internationally
  7 33 active insurance group to ensure all of the following:

  8  1 that are engaged in the business of insurance are identified
  8  2 by management.
  8  3    (2)  That reasonable and effective mitigation measures are
  8  4 in place.
  8  5    b.  Requesting, from any member of an internationally active
  8  6 insurance group subject to the commissioner's group=wide
  8  7 supervision, information necessary and appropriate to assess
  8  8 enterprise risk, including but not limited to information about
  8  9 the members of the internationally active insurance group
  8 10 regarding all of the following:
  8 11    (1)  Governance, risk assessment, and management.
  8 12    (2)  Capital adequacy.
  8 13    (3)  Material intercompany transactions.
  8 14    c.  Coordinating and, through the authority of the
  8 15 regulatory officials of the jurisdictions where members of
  8 16 the internationally active insurance group are domiciled,
  8 17 compelling the development and implementation of reasonable
  8 18 measures designed to ensure that the internationally active
  8 19 insurance group is able to timely recognize and mitigate
  8 20 enterprise risks to members of the internationally active
  8 21 insurance group that are engaged in the business of insurance.
  8 22    d.  Communicating with other state, federal, and
  8 23 international regulatory agencies for members within the
  8 24 internationally active insurance group and sharing relevant
  8 25 information, subject to the confidentiality provisions of
  8 26 section 521A.7, through supervisory colleges as set forth in
  8 27 section 521A.6A or otherwise.
  8 28    e.  Entering into agreements with or obtaining documentation
  8 29 from any insurer registered under section 521A.4, any member
  8 30 of an internationally active insurance group, and any other
  8 31 state, federal, or international regulatory agency for members
  8 32 of the internationally active insurance group, that provides
  8 33 the basis for or otherwise clarifies the commissioner's role as
  8 34 group=wide supervisor of an internationally active insurance
  8 35 group, including provisions for resolving disputes with other
  9  1 regulatory officials. Such agreements or documentation shall
  9  2 not serve as evidence in any proceeding that any insurer or
  9  3 person within an insurance company holding company system not
  9  4 domiciled or incorporated in this state is doing business in
  9  5 this state or is otherwise subject to jurisdiction in this
  9  6 state.
  9  7    f.  Other activities of group=wide supervision, consistent
  9  8 with the authority and purposes set forth in this section, as

  9 16 undertaken by that regulatory official provided that all of the
  9 17 following occur:
  9 18    a.  The commissioner's cooperation is in compliance with the

  9 20    b.  The regulatory official acknowledged as the group=wide
  9 21 supervisor of the internationally active insurance group also
  9 22 recognizes and cooperates with the commissioner's activities
  9 23 as a group=wide supervisor for other internationally active
  9 24 insurance groups, where applicable.  If such recognition and
  9 25 cooperation is not reasonably reciprocal, the commissioner may
  9 26 refuse recognition and cooperation to that regulatory official.
  9 27    7.  The commissioner is authorized to enter into agreements
  9 28 with or obtain documentation from any insurer registered under
  9 29 section 521A.4, any affiliate of the insurer, and any other
  9 30 state, federal, or international regulatory agency for members
  9 31 of the internationally active insurance group, that provides
  9 32 the basis for or otherwise clarifies another regulatory
  9 33 official's role as group=wide supervisor of an internationally
  9 34 active insurance group.
  9 35    8.  An insurer registered under section 521A.4 that is
 10  1 subject to this section shall be liable for and shall pay the
 10  2 reasonable expenses of the commissioner's participation in
 10  3 the administration of this section, including the engagement
 10  4 of attorneys, actuaries, accountants, and other experts not

 10  7 direction and control of the commissioner and shall act in a
 10  8 purely advisory capacity.
 10  9    9.  The commissioner shall adopt rules pursuant to chapter
 10 10 17A to administer this section.
 10 11    Sec. 10.  Section 521A.7, subsection 1, Code 2016, is amended

  5 35 internationally active insurance group under a regulatory
  6  1 system that the commissioner determines to be either of the
  6  2 following:
  6  3    (a)  Substantially similar to the system of regulation
  6  4 provided under the laws of this state.
  6  5    (b)  Otherwise sufficient in terms of providing for
  6  6 group=wide supervision, enterprise risk analysis, and
  6  7 cooperation with other regulatory officials.
  6  8    (5)  Whether another regulatory official acting as

  6 10 internationally active insurance group provides the
  6 11 commissioner with reasonably reciprocal recognition and
  6 12 cooperation.
  6 13    b.  Notwithstanding paragraph "a", even if the commissioner

  6 24 acknowledgment of other regulatory officials involved with
  6 25 supervision of members of the internationally active insurance
  6 26 group, and in consultation with the internationally active

  6 28    3.  Notwithstanding any other provision of law, when another

  6 30 an internationally active insurance group, the commissioner
  6 31 shall acknowledge that regulatory official as the group=wide
  6 32 supervisor of the internationally active insurance group.

  8 16 the internationally active insurance group are domiciled,
  8 17 compelling the development and implementation of reasonable

  8 19 insurance group is able to timely recognize and mitigate
  8 20 enterprise risks to members of the internationally active
  8 21 insurance group that are engaged in the business of insurance.
  8 22    d.  Communicating with other state, federal, and
  8 23 international regulatory agencies for members within the
  8 24 internationally active insurance group and sharing relevant
  8 25 information, subject to the confidentiality provisions of

  8 27 section 521A.6A or otherwise.
  8 28    e.  Entering into agreements with or obtaining documentation

  8 32 of the internationally active insurance group, that provides
  8 33 the basis for or otherwise clarifies the commissioner's role as
  8 34 group=wide supervisor of an internationally active insurance
  8 35 group, including provisions for resolving disputes with other
  9  1 regulatory officials. Such agreements or documentation shall
  9  2 not serve as evidence in any proceeding that any insurer or
  9  3 person within an insurance company holding company system not
  9  4 domiciled or incorporated in this state is doing business in
  9  5 this state or is otherwise subject to jurisdiction in this

  9 11 official from a jurisdiction that is not accredited by the
  9 12 national association of insurance commissioners is the
  9 13 group=wide supervisor of an internationally active insurance
  9 14 group, the commissioner may reasonably cooperate through a
  9 15 supervisory college or otherwise, with group=wide supervision
  9 16 undertaken by that regulatory official provided that all of the
  9 17 following occur:
  9 18    a.  The commissioner's cooperation is in compliance with the
  9 19 laws of this state.
  9 20    b.  The regulatory official acknowledged as the group=wide
  9 21 supervisor of the internationally active insurance group also
  9 22 recognizes and cooperates with the commissioner's activities
  9 23 as a group=wide supervisor for other internationally active
  9 24 insurance groups, where applicable.  If such recognition and
  9 25 cooperation is not reasonably reciprocal, the commissioner may
  9 26 refuse recognition and cooperation to that regulatory official.
  9 27    7.  The commissioner is authorized to enter into agreements
  9 28 with or obtain documentation from any insurer registered under
  9 29 section 521A.4, any affiliate of the insurer, and any other
  9 30 state, federal, or international regulatory agency for members
  9 31 of the internationally active insurance group, that provides
  9 32 the basis for or otherwise clarifies another regulatory
  9 33 official's role as group=wide supervisor of an internationally
  9 34 active insurance group.
  9 35    8.  An insurer registered under section 521A.4 that is
 10  1 subject to this section shall be liable for and shall pay the
 10  2 reasonable expenses of the commissioner's participation in
 10  3 the administration of this section, including the engagement
 10  4 of attorneys, actuaries, accountants, and other experts not
 10  5 otherwise a part of the commissioner's staff and all reasonable
 10  6 travel expenses.  Any persons so retained shall be under the
 10  7 direction and control of the commissioner and shall act in a
 10  8 purely advisory capacity.
 10  9    9.  The commissioner shall adopt rules pursuant to chapter
 10 10 17A to administer this section.
 10 11    Sec. 10.  Section 521A.7, subsection 1, Code 2016, is amended
 10 12 to read as follows:
 10 13    1.  All information, documents, and copies thereof obtained
 10 14 by or disclosed to the commissioner or any other person in
 10 15 the course of an examination or investigation made pursuant
 10 16 to section 521A.6 or 521A.6A, and all information reported
 10 17   5  9 make a determination of or acknowledge a group=wide supervisor
  5 10 for such an insurance holding company system pursuant to this
  5 11 section.
  5 12    2.  a.  In cooperation with other state, federal, and
  5 13 international regulatory agencies, the commissioner shall
  5 14 identify a single group=wide supervisor for an internationally
  5 15 active insurance group.  The commissioner may determine that
  5 16 the commissioner is the appropriate group=wide supervisor
  5 17 for an internationally active insurance group that conducts
  5 18 substantial insurance operations concentrated in this state,
  5 19 or the commissioner may acknowledge that a regulatory official
  5 20 from another jurisdiction is the appropriate group=wide
  5 21 supervisor for the internationally active insurance group.  In
  5 22 making a determination or acknowledgment under this paragraph
  5 23 "a", the commissioner shall consider the following factors:
  5 24    (1)  The place of domicile of the insurers within the
  5 25 internationally active insurance group that hold the largest
  5 26 share of the group's written premiums, assets, or liabilities.
  5 27    (2)  The place of domicile of the top=tiered insurers in the
  5 28 insurance holding company system of the internationally active
  5 29 insurance group.
  5 30    (3)  The location of the executive offices or largest
  5 31 operational offices of the internationally active insurance
  5 32 group.
  5 33    (4)  Whether another regulatory official is acting as
  5 34 or is seeking to act as the group=wide supervisor of the
  5 35 internationally active insurance group under a regulatory
  6  1 system that the commissioner determines to be either of the
  6  2 following:
  6  3    (a)  Substantially similar to the system of regulation
  6  4 provided under the laws of this state.
  6  5    (b)  Otherwise sufficient in terms of providing for
  6  6 group=wide supervision, enterprise risk analysis, and
  6  7 cooperation with other regulatory officials.
  6  8    (5)  Whether another regulatory official acting as
  6  9 or seeking to act as the group=wide supervisor for the
  6 10 internationally active insurance group provides the
  6 11 commissioner with reasonably reciprocal recognition and
  6 12 cooperation.
  6 13    b.  Notwithstanding paragraph "a", even if the commissioner
  6 14 is identified pursuant to this subsection as the group=wide
  6 15 supervisor of an internationally active insurance group,
  6 16 the commissioner may determine that it is appropriate to
  6 17 acknowledge another regulatory official to serve as the
  6 18 group=wide supervisor of the internationally active insurance
  6 19 group.
  6 20    c.  The acknowledgment of a group=wide supervisor pursuant
  6 21 to this subsection shall be made after consideration of the
  6 22 factors listed in paragraph "a", subparagraphs (1) through
  6 23 (5), and shall be made in cooperation with and subject to the
  6 24 acknowledgment of other regulatory officials involved with
  6 25 supervision of members of the internationally active insurance
  6 26 group, and in consultation with the internationally active
  6 27 insurance group.
  6 28    3.  Notwithstanding any other provision of law, when another
  6 29 regulatory official is acting as the group=wide supervisor of
  6 30 an internationally active insurance group, the commissioner
  6 31 shall acknowledge that regulatory official as the group=wide
  6 32 supervisor of the internationally active insurance group.
  6 33 However, the commissioner shall make a new determination or
  6 34 acknowledgment as to the appropriate group=wide supervisor for
  6 35 the internationally active insurance group in the event that a
  7  1 material change in the internationally active insurance group
  7  2 results in either of the following:
  7  3    a.  The internationally active insurance group's insurers
  7  4 domiciled in Iowa holding the largest share of the group's
  7  5 premiums, assets, or liabilities.
  7  6    b.  Iowa being the place of domicile of the top=tiered
  7  7 insurers in the insurance holding company system of the
  7  8 internationally active insurance group.
  7  9    4.  Pursuant to section 521A.6, the commissioner is
  7 10 authorized to collect from any insurer registered pursuant to
  7 11 section 521A.4 all information necessary to determine whether
  7 12 it is appropriate for the commissioner to act as the group=wide
  7 13 supervisor of an internationally active insurance group or
  7 14 to acknowledge another regulatory official to act as the
  7 15 group=wide supervisor of the internationally active insurance
  7 16 group. Prior to issuing a determination or acknowledgment
  7 17 pursuant to this section, the commissioner shall notify the
  7 18 insurer registered pursuant to section 521A.4 and the ultimate
  7 19 controlling person within the internationally active insurance
  7 20 group of the pending determination or acknowledgment. The
  7 21 insurer and the internationally active insurance group shall
  7 22 have not less than thirty days to provide the commissioner with
  7 23 additional information pertinent to the commissioner's pending
  7 24 determination or acknowledgment. The commissioner shall
  7 25 publish the identity of the internationally active insurance
  7 26 groups that the commissioner has determined are subject to
  7 27 group=wide supervision by the commissioner.
  7 28    5.  If a determination is made that the commissioner is the
  7 29 appropriate group=wide supervisor for an internationally active
  7 30 insurance group, the commissioner is authorized to engage in
  7 31 any of the following group=wide supervision activities:
  7 32    a.  Assessing the enterprise risks within the internationally
  7 33 active insurance group to ensure all of the following:
  7 34    (1)  That the material financial condition and liquidity

  8  1 that are engaged in the business of insurance are identified
  8  2 by management.
  8  3    (2)  That reasonable and effective mitigation measures are
  8  4 in place.
  8  5    b.  Requesting, from any member of an internationally active
  8  6 insurance group subject to the commissioner's group=wide
  8  7 supervision, information necessary and appropriate to assess
  8  8 enterprise risk, including but not limited to information about
  8  9 the members of the internationally active insurance group
  8 10 regarding all of the following:
  8 11    (1)  Governance, risk assessment, and management.
  8 12    (2)  Capital adequacy.
  8 13    (3)  Material intercompany transactions.
  8 14    c.  Coordinating and, through the authority of the
  8 15 regulatory officials of the jurisdictions where members of
  8 16 the internationally active insurance group are domiciled,
  8 17 compelling the development and implementation of reasonable
  8 18 measures designed to ensure that the internationally active
  8 19 insurance group is able to timely recognize and mitigate
  8 20 enterprise risks to members of the internationally active
  8 21 insurance group that are engaged in the business of insurance.
  8 22    d.  Communicating with other state, federal, and
  8 23 international regulatory agencies for members within the
  8 24 internationally active insurance group and sharing relevant
  8 25 information, subject to the confidentiality provisions of
  8 26 section 521A.7, through supervisory colleges as set forth in
  8 27 section 521A.6A or otherwise.
  8 28    e.  Entering into agreements with or obtaining documentation
  8 29 from any insurer registered under section 521A.4, any member
  8 30 of an internationally active insurance group, and any other
  8 31 state, federal, or international regulatory agency for members
  8 32 of the internationally active insurance group, that provides
  8 33 the basis for or otherwise clarifies the commissioner's role as
  8 34 group=wide supervisor of an internationally active insurance
  8 35 group, including provisions for resolving disputes with other
  9  1 regulatory officials. Such agreements or documentation shall
  9  2 not serve as evidence in any proceeding that any insurer or
  9  3 person within an insurance company holding company system not
  9  4 domiciled or incorporated in this state is doing business in
  9  5 this state or is otherwise subject to jurisdiction in this
  9  6 state.

  9  8 with the authority and purposes set forth in this section, as

  9 11 official from a jurisdiction that is not accredited by the
  9 12 national association of insurance commissioners is the
  9 13 group=wide supervisor of an internationally active insurance
  9 14 group, the commissioner may reasonably cooperate through a
  9 15 supervisory college or otherwise, with group=wide supervision
  9 16 undertaken by that regulatory official provided that all of the
  9 17 following occur:
  9 18    a.  The commissioner's cooperation is in compliance with the
  9 19 laws of this state.
  9 20    b.  The regulatory official acknowledged as the group=wide
  9 21 supervisor of the internationally active insurance group also
  9 22 recognizes and cooperates with the commissioner's activities
  9 23 as a group=wide supervisor for other internationally active
  9 24 insurance groups, where applicable.  If such recognition and
  9 25 cooperation is not reasonably reciprocal, the commissioner may
  9 26 refuse recognition and cooperation to that regulatory official.
  9 27    7.  The commissioner is authorized to enter into agreements
  9 28 with or obtain documentation from any insurer registered under
  9 29 section 521A.4, any affiliate of the insurer, and any other
  9 30 state, federal, or international regulatory agency for members
  9 31 of the internationally active insurance group, that provides
  9 32 the basis for or otherwise clarifies another regulatory
  9 33 official's role as group=wide supervisor of an internationally
  9 34 active insurance group.
  9 35    8.  An insurer registered under section 521A.4 that is
 10  1 subject to this section shall be liable for and shall pay the
 10  2 reasonable expenses of the commissioner's participation in
 10  3 the administration of this section, including the engagement

 10  6 travel expenses.  Any persons so retained shall be under the
 10  7 direction and control of the commissioner and shall act in a
 10  8 purely advisory capacity.
 10  9    9.  The commissioner shall adopt rules pursuant to chapter

  6  1 system that the commissioner determines to be either of the
  6  2 following:
  6  3    (a)  Substantially similar to the system of regulation
  6  4 provided under the laws of this state.
  6  5    (b)  Otherwise sufficient in terms of providing for

  6 28    3.  Notwithstanding any other provision of law, when another

  5 16 the commissioner is the appropriate group=wide supervisor
  5 17 for an internationally active insurance group that conducts
  5 18 substantial insurance operations concentrated in this state,
  5 19 or the commissioner may acknowledge that a regulatory official
  5 20 from another jurisdiction is the appropriate group=wide
  5 21 supervisor for the internationally active insurance group.  In
  5 22 making a determination or acknowledgment under this paragraph
  5 23 "a", the commissioner shall consider the following factors:
  5 24    (1)  The place of domicile of the insurers within the
  5 25 internationally active insurance group that hold the largest
  5 26 share of the group's written premiums, assets, or liabilities.
  5 27    (2)  The place of domicile of the top=tiered insurers in the
  5 28 insurance holding company system of the internationally active
  5 29 insurance group.
  5 30    (3)  The location of the executive offices or largest
  5 31 operational offices of the internationally active insurance
  5 32 group.
  5 33    (4)  Whether another regulatory official is acting as
  5 34 or is seeking to act as the group=wide supervisor of the
  5 35 internationally active insurance group under a regulatory
  6  1 system that the commissioner determines to be either of the
  6  2 following:
  6  3    (a)  Substantially similar to the system of regulation
  6  4 provided under the laws of this state.
  6  5    (b)  Otherwise sufficient in terms of providing for
  6  6 group=wide supervision, enterprise risk analysis, and
  6  7 cooperation with other regulatory officials.
  6  8    (5)  Whether another regulatory official acting as
  6  9 or seeking to act as the group=wide supervisor for the
  6 10 internationally active insurance group provides the
  6 11 commissioner with reasonably reciprocal recognition and
  6 12 cooperation.
  6 13    b.  Notwithstanding paragraph "a", even if the commissioner
  6 14 is identified pursuant to this subsection as the group=wide
  6 15 supervisor of an internationally active insurance group,
  6 16 the commissioner may determine that it is appropriate to
  6 17 acknowledge another regulatory official to serve as the
  6 18 group=wide supervisor of the internationally active insurance
  6 19 group.
  6 20    c.  The acknowledgment of a group=wide supervisor pursuant
  6 21 to this subsection shall be made after consideration of the
  6 22 factors listed in paragraph "a", subparagraphs (1) through
  6 23 (5), and shall be made in cooperation with and subject to the
  6 24 acknowledgment of other regulatory officials involved with
  6 25 supervision of members of the internationally active insurance
  6 26 group, and in consultation with the internationally active
  6 27 insurance group.
  6 28    3.  Notwithstanding any other provision of law, when another
  6 29 regulatory official is acting as the group=wide supervisor of
  6 30 an internationally active insurance group, the commissioner
  6 31 shall acknowledge that regulatory official as the group=wide
  6 32 supervisor of the internationally active insurance group.
  6 33 However, the commissioner shall make a new determination or
  6 34 acknowledgment as to the appropriate group=wide supervisor for
  6 35 the internationally active insurance group in the event that a
  7  1 material change in the internationally active insurance group
  7  2 results in either of the following:
  7  3    a.  The internationally active insurance group's insurers
  7  4 domiciled in Iowa holding the largest share of the group's
  7  5 premiums, assets, or liabilities.
  7  6    b.  Iowa being the place of domicile of the top=tiered
  7  7 insurers in the insurance holding company system of the
  7  8 internationally active insurance group.
  7  9    4.  Pursuant to section 521A.6, the commissioner is
  7 10 authorized to collect from any insurer registered pursuant to
  7 11 section 521A.4 all information necessary to determine whether
  7 12 it is appropriate for the commissioner to act as the group=wide
  7 13 supervisor of an internationally active insurance group or
  7 14 to acknowledge another regulatory official to act as the
  7 15 group=wide supervisor of the internationally active insurance
  7 16 group. Prior to issuing a determination or acknowledgment
  7 17 pursuant to this section, the commissioner shall notify the
  7 18 insurer registered pursuant to section 521A.4 and the ultimate
  7 19 controlling person within the internationally active insurance
  7 20 group of the pending determination or acknowledgment. The
  7 21 insurer and the internationally active insurance group shall
  7 22 have not less than thirty days to provide the commissioner with
  7 23 additional information pertinent to the commissioner's pending
  7 24 determination or acknowledgment. The commissioner shall
  7 25 publish the identity of the internationally active insurance
  7 26 groups that the commissioner has determined are subject to
  7 27 group=wide supervision by the commissioner.
  7 28    5.  If a determination is made that the commissioner is the
  7 29 appropriate group=wide supervisor for an internationally active
  7 30 insurance group, the commissioner is authorized to engage in
  7 31 any of the following group=wide supervision activities:
  7 32    a.  Assessing the enterprise risks within the internationally
  7 33 active insurance group to ensure all of the following:
  7 34    (1)  That the material financial condition and liquidity
  7 35 risks to members of the internationally active insurance group
  8  1 that are engaged in the business of insurance are identified
  8  2 by management.
  8  3    (2)  That reasonable and effective mitigation measures are
  8  4 in place.
  8  5    b.  Requesting, from any member of an internationally active
  8  6 insurance group subject to the commissioner's group=wide
  8  7 supervision, information necessary and appropriate to assess
  8  8 enterprise risk, including but not limited to information about
  8  9 the members of the internationally active insurance group
  8 10 regarding all of the following:
  8 11    (1)  Governance, risk assessment, and management.
  8 12    (2)  Capital adequacy.
  8 13    (3)  Material intercompany transactions.
  8 14    c.  Coordinating and, through the authority of the
  8 15 regulatory officials of the jurisdictions where members of
  8 16 the internationally active insurance group are domiciled,
  8 17 compelling the development and implementation of reasonable
  8 18 measures designed to ensure that the internationally active
  8 19 insurance group is able to timely recognize and mitigate
  8 20 enterprise risks to members of the internationally active
  8 21 insurance group that are engaged in the business of insurance.
  8 22    d.  Communicating with other state, federal, and
  8 23 international regulatory agencies for members within the
  8 24 internationally active insurance group and sharing relevant
  8 25 information, subject to the confidentiality provisions of
  8 26 section 521A.7, through supervisory colleges as set forth in
  8 27 section 521A.6A or otherwise.
  8 28    e.  Entering into agreements with or obtaining documentation
  8 29 from any insurer registered under section 521A.4, any member
  8 30 of an internationally active insurance group, and any other
  8 31 state, federal, or international regulatory agency for members
  8 32 of the internationally active insurance group, that provides
  8 33 the basis for or otherwise clarifies the commissioner's role as
  8 34 group=wide supervisor of an internationally active insurance
  8 35 group, including provisions for resolving disputes with other
  9  1 regulatory officials. Such agreements or documentation shall
  9  2 not serve as evidence in any proceeding that any insurer or
  9  3 person within an insurance company holding company system not
  9  4 domiciled or incorporated in this state is doing business in
  9  5 this state or is otherwise subject to jurisdiction in this
  9  6 state.
  9  7    f.  Other activities of group=wide supervision, consistent
  9  8 with the authority and purposes set forth in this section, as
  9  9 considered necessary by the commissioner.
  9 10    6.  If the commissioner acknowledges that another regulatory
  9 11 official from a jurisdiction that is not accredited by the
  9 12 national association of insurance commissioners is the
  9 13 group=wide supervisor of an internationally active insurance
  9 14 group, the commissioner may reasonably cooperate through a
  9 15 supervisory college or otherwise, with group=wide supervision
  9 16 undertaken by that regulatory official provided that all of the
  9 17 following occur:
  9 18    a.  The commissioner's cooperation is in compliance with the
  9 19 laws of this state.
  9 20    b.  The regulatory official acknowledged as the group=wide
  9 21 supervisor of the internationally active insurance group also
  9 22 recognizes and cooperates with the commissioner's activities
  9 23 as a group=wide supervisor for other internationally active
  9 24 insurance groups, where applicable.  If such recognition and
  9 25 cooperation is not reasonably reciprocal, the commissioner may
  9 26 refuse recognition and cooperation to that regulatory official.
  9 27    7.  The commissioner is authorized to enter into agreements
  9 28 with or obtain documentation from any insurer registered under
  9 29 section 521A.4, any affiliate of the insurer, and any other
  9 30 state, federal, or international regulatory agency for members
  9 31 of the internationally active insurance group, that provides
  9 32 the basis for or otherwise clarifies another regulatory
  9 33 official's role as group=wide supervisor of an internationally
  9 34 active insurance group.
  9 35    8.  An insurer registered under section 521A.4 that is
 10  1 subject to this section shall be liable for and shall pay the
 10  2 reasonable expenses of the commissioner's participation in
 10  3 the administration of this section, including the engagement
 10  4 of attorneys, actuaries, accountants, and other experts not
 10  5 otherwise a part of the commissioner's staff and all reasonable
 10  6 travel expenses.  Any persons so retained shall be under the
 10  7 direction and control of the commissioner and shall act in a
 10  8 purely advisory capacity.
 10  9    9.  The commissioner shall adopt rules pursuant to chapter
 10 10 17A to administer this section.
 10 11    Sec. 10.  Section 521A.7, subsection 1, Code 2016, is amended
 10 12 to read as follows:
 10 13    1.  All information, documents, and copies thereof obtained
 10 14 by or disclosed to the commissioner or any other person in
 10 15 the course of an examination or investigation made pursuant
 10 16 to section 521A.6 or 521A.6A, and all information reported
 10 17   5 12    2.  a.  In cooperation with other state, federal, and
  5 13 international regulatory agencies, the commissioner shall
  5 14 identify a single group=wide supervisor for an internationally
  5 15 active insurance group.  The commissioner may determine that
  5 16 the commissioner is the appropriate group=wide supervisor
  5 17 for an internationally active insurance group that conducts
  5 18 substantial insurance operations concentrated in this state,
  5 19 or the commissioner may acknowledge that a regulatory official
  5 20 from another jurisdiction is the appropriate group=wide
  5 21 supervisor for the internationally active insurance group.  In
  5 22 making a determination or acknowledgment under this paragraph
  5 23 "a", the commissioner shall consider the following factors:
  5 24    (1)  The place of domicile of the insurers within the
  5 25 internationally active insurance group that hold the largest
  5 26 share of the group's written premiums, assets, or liabilities.
  5 27    (2)  The place of domicile of the top=tiered insurers in the
  5 28 insurance holding company system of the internationally active
  5 29 insurance group.
  5 30    (3)  The location of the executive offices or largest
  5 31 operational offices of the internationally active insurance
  5 32 group.
  5 33    (4)  Whether another regulatory official is acting as
  5 34 or is seeking to act as the group=wide supervisor of the
  5 35 internationally active insurance group under a regulatory
  6  1 system that the commissioner determines to be either of the
  6  2 following:
  6  3    (a)  Substantially similar to the system of regulation
  6  4 provided under the laws of this state.
  6  5    (b)  Otherwise sufficient in terms of providing for
  6  6 group=wide supervision, enterprise risk analysis, and
  6  7 cooperation with other regulatory officials.
  6  8    (5)  Whether another regulatory official acting as
  6  9 or seeking to act as the group=wide supervisor for the
  6 10 internationally active insurance group provides the
  6 11 commissioner with reasonably reciprocal recognition and
  6 12 cooperation.
  6 13    b.  Notwithstanding paragraph "a", even if the commissioner
  6 14 is identified pursuant to this subsection as the group=wide
  6 15 supervisor of an internationally active insurance group,
  6 16 the commissioner may determine that it is appropriate to
  6 17 acknowledge another regulatory official to serve as the
  6 18 group=wide supervisor of the internationally active insurance
  6 19 group.
  6 20    c.  The acknowledgment of a group=wide supervisor pursuant
  6 21 to this subsection shall be made after consideration of the
  6 22 factors listed in paragraph "a", subparagraphs (1) through
  6 23 (5), and shall be made in cooperation with and subject to the
  6 24 acknowledgment of other regulatory officials involved with
  6 25 supervision of members of the internationally active insurance
  6 26 group, and in consultation with the internationally active
  6 27 insurance group.
  6 28    3.  Notwithstanding any other provision of law, when another
  6 29 regulatory official is acting as the group=wide supervisor of
  6 30 an internationally active insurance group, the commissioner
  6 31 shall acknowledge that regulatory official as the group=wide
  6 32 supervisor of the internationally active insurance group.
  6 33 However, the commissioner shall make a new determination or
  6 34 acknowledgment as to the appropriate group=wide supervisor for
  6 35 the internationally active insurance group in the event that a
  7  1 material change in the internationally active insurance group
  7  2 results in either of the following:
  7  3    a.  The internationally active insurance group's insurers
  7  4 domiciled in Iowa holding the largest share of the group's
  7  5 premiums, assets, or liabilities.

  7  7 insurers in the insurance holding company system of the
  7  8 internationally active insurance group.

  7 10 authorized to collect from any insurer registered pursuant to

  7 21 insurer and the internationally active insurance group shall
  7 22 have not less than thirty days to provide the commissioner with
  7 23 additional information pertinent to the commissioner's pending
  7 24 determination or acknowledgment. The commissioner shall
  7 25 publish the identity of the internationally active insurance
  7 26 groups that the commissioner has determined are subject to
  7 27 group=wide supervision by the commissioner.
  7 28    5.  If a determination is made that the commissioner is the
  7 29 appropriate group=wide supervisor for an internationally active
  7 30 insurance group, the commissioner is authorized to engage in
  7 31 any of the following group=wide supervision activities:
  7 32    a.  Assessing the enterprise risks within the internationally

  9 35    8.  An insurer registered under section 521A.4 that is

  5 18 substantial insurance operations concentrated in this state,
  5 19 or the commissioner may acknowledge that a regulatory official
  5 20 from another jurisdiction is the appropriate group=wide

  5 35 internationally active insurance group under a regulatory
  6  1 system that the commissioner determines to be either of the
  6  2 following:

  6 13    b.  Notwithstanding paragraph "a", even if the commissioner

  8 33 the basis for or otherwise clarifies the commissioner's role as
  8 34 group=wide supervisor of an internationally active insurance
  8 35 group, including provisions for resolving disputes with other

  9  3 person within an insurance company holding company system not
  9  4 domiciled or incorporated in this state is doing business in
  9  5 this state or is otherwise subject to jurisdiction in this

  9  7    f.  Other activities of group=wide supervision, consistent
  9  8 with the authority and purposes set forth in this section, as

  9 11 official from a jurisdiction that is not accredited by the
  9 12 national association of insurance commissioners is the
  9 13 group=wide supervisor of an internationally active insurance
  9 14 group, the commissioner may reasonably cooperate through a

  9 16 undertaken by that regulatory official provided that all of the

  9 21 supervisor of the internationally active insurance group also
  9 22 recognizes and cooperates with the commissioner's activities
  9 23 as a group=wide supervisor for other internationally active
  9 24 insurance groups, where applicable.  If such recognition and
  9 25 cooperation is not reasonably reciprocal, the commissioner may
  9 26 refuse recognition and cooperation to that regulatory official.
  9 27    7.  The commissioner is authorized to enter into agreements
  9 28 with or obtain documentation from any insurer registered under
  9 29 section 521A.4, any affiliate of the insurer, and any other
  9 30 state, federal, or international regulatory agency for members
  9 31 of the internationally active insurance group, that provides
  9 32 the basis for or otherwise clarifies another regulatory
  9 33 official's role as group=wide supervisor of an internationally
  9 34 active insurance group.
  9 35    8.  An insurer registered under section 521A.4 that is
 10  1 subject to this section shall be liable for and shall pay the
 10  2 reasonable expenses of the commissioner's participation in
 10  3 the administration of this section, including the engagement
 10  4 of attorneys, actuaries, accountants, and other experts not
 10  5 otherwise a part of the commissioner's staff and all reasonable
 10  6 travel expenses.  Any persons so retained shall be under the
 10  7 direction and control of the commissioner and shall act in a
 10  8 purely advisory capacity.
 10  9    9.  The commissioner shall adopt rules pursuant to chapter
 10 10 17A to administer this section.
 10 11    Sec. 10.  Section 521A.7, subsection 1, Code 2016, is amended
 10 12 to read as follows:
 10 13    1.  All information, documents, and copies thereof obtained
 10 14 by or disclosed to the commissioner or any other person in
 10 15 the course of an examination or investigation made pursuant
 10 16 to section 521A.6 or 521A.6A, and all information reported
 10 17   5 14 identify a single group=wide supervisor for an internationally
  5 15 active insurance group.  The commissioner may determine that
  5 16 the commissioner is the appropriate group=wide supervisor
  5 17 for an internationally active insurance group that conducts
  5 18 substantial insurance operations concentrated in this state,
  5 19 or the commissioner may acknowledge that a regulatory official
  5 20 from another jurisdiction is the appropriate group=wide
  5 21 supervisor for the internationally active insurance group.  In
  5 22 making a determination or acknowledgment under this paragraph
  5 23 "a", the commissioner shall consider the following factors:
  5 24    (1)  The place of domicile of the insurers within the
  5 25 internationally active insurance group that hold the largest
  5 26 share of the group's written premiums, assets, or liabilities.
  5 27    (2)  The place of domicile of the top=tiered insurers in the
  5 28 insurance holding company system of the internationally active
  5 29 insurance group.
  5 30    (3)  The location of the executive offices or largest
  5 31 operational offices of the internationally active insurance
  5 32 group.
  5 33    (4)  Whether another regulatory official is acting as
  5 34 or is seeking to act as the group=wide supervisor of the
  5 35 internationally active insurance group under a regulatory
  6  1 system that the commissioner determines to be either of the
  6  2 following:
  6  3    (a)  Substantially similar to the system of regulation
  6  4 provided under the laws of this state.
  6  5    (b)  Otherwise sufficient in terms of providing for
  6  6 group=wide supervision, enterprise risk analysis, and
  6  7 cooperation with other regulatory officials.
  6  8    (5)  Whether another regulatory official acting as
  6  9 or seeking to act as the group=wide supervisor for the
  6 10 internationally active insurance group provides the
  6 11 commissioner with reasonably reciprocal recognition and
  6 12 cooperation.
  6 13    b.  Notwithstanding paragraph "a", even if the commissioner
  6 14 is identified pursuant to this subsection as the group=wide
  6 15 supervisor of an internationally active insurance group,
  6 16 the commissioner may determine that it is appropriate to
  6 17 acknowledge another regulatory official to serve as the
  6 18 group=wide supervisor of the internationally active insurance
  6 19 group.
  6 20    c.  The acknowledgment of a group=wide supervisor pursuant
  6 21 to this subsection shall be made after consideration of the
  6 22 factors listed in paragraph "a", subparagraphs (1) through
  6 23 (5), and shall be made in cooperation with and subject to the
  6 24 acknowledgment of other regulatory officials involved with
  6 25 supervision of members of the internationally active insurance
  6 26 group, and in consultation with the internationally active
  6 27 insurance group.
  6 28    3.  Notwithstanding any other provision of law, when another
  6 29 regulatory official is acting as the group=wide supervisor of
  6 30 an internationally active insurance group, the commissioner
  6 31 shall acknowledge that regulatory official as the group=wide
  6 32 supervisor of the internationally active insurance group.
  6 33 However, the commissioner shall make a new determination or
  6 34 acknowledgment as to the appropriate group=wide supervisor for
  6 35 the internationally active insurance group in the event that a
  7  1 material change in the internationally active insurance group
  7  2 results in either of the following:
  7  3    a.  The internationally active insurance group's insurers
  7  4 domiciled in Iowa holding the largest share of the group's
  7  5 premiums, assets, or liabilities.
  7  6    b.  Iowa being the place of domicile of the top=tiered
  7  7 insurers in the insurance holding company system of the
  7  8 internationally active insurance group.

  7 10 authorized to collect from any insurer registered pursuant to
  7 11 section 521A.4 all information necessary to determine whether
  7 12 it is appropriate for the commissioner to act as the group=wide
  7 13 supervisor of an internationally active insurance group or
  7 14 to acknowledge another regulatory official to act as the
  7 15 group=wide supervisor of the internationally active insurance
  7 16 group. Prior to issuing a determination or acknowledgment
  7 17 pursuant to this section, the commissioner shall notify the
  7 18 insurer registered pursuant to section 521A.4 and the ultimate
  7 19 controlling person within the internationally active insurance
  7 20 group of the pending determination or acknowledgment. The
  7 21 insurer and the internationally active insurance group shall
  7 22 have not less than thirty days to provide the commissioner with
  7 23 additional information pertinent to the commissioner's pending
  7 24 determination or acknowledgment. The commissioner shall
  7 25 publish the identity of the internationally active insurance
  7 26 groups that the commissioner has determined are subject to
  7 27 group=wide supervision by the commissioner.
  7 28    5.  If a determination is made that the commissioner is the
  7 29 appropriate group=wide supervisor for an internationally active
  7 30 insurance group, the commissioner is authorized to engage in
  7 31 any of the following group=wide supervision activities:
  7 32    a.  Assessing the enterprise risks within the internationally
  7 33 active insurance group to ensure all of the following:

  8  3    (2)  That reasonable and effective mitigation measures are
  8  4 in place.
  8  5    b.  Requesting, from any member of an internationally active
  8  6 insurance group subject to the commissioner's group=wide
  8  7 supervision, information necessary and appropriate to assess

  8 16 the internationally active insurance group are domiciled,
  8 17 compelling the development and implementation of reasonable
  8 18 measures designed to ensure that the internationally active
  8 19 insurance group is able to timely recognize and mitigate
  8 20 enterprise risks to members of the internationally active
  8 21 insurance group that are engaged in the business of insurance.
  8 22    d.  Communicating with other state, federal, and
  8 23 international regulatory agencies for members within the
  8 24 internationally active insurance group and sharing relevant
  8 25 information, subject to the confidentiality provisions of
  8 26 section 521A.7, through supervisory colleges as set forth in

  8 32 of the internationally active insurance group, that provides
  8 33 the basis for or otherwise clarifies the commissioner's role as
  8 34 group=wide supervisor of an internationally active insurance
  8 35 group, including provisions for resolving disputes with other
  9  1 regulatory officials. Such agreements or documentation shall
  9  2 not serve as evidence in any proceeding that any insurer or
  9  3 person within an insurance company holding company system not
  9  4 domiciled or incorporated in this state is doing business in
  9  5 this state or is otherwise subject to jurisdiction in this
  9  6 state.
  9  7    f.  Other activities of group=wide supervision, consistent
  9  8 with the authority and purposes set forth in this section, as

  9 11 official from a jurisdiction that is not accredited by the
  9 12 national association of insurance commissioners is the
  9 13 group=wide supervisor of an internationally active insurance
  9 14 group, the commissioner may reasonably cooperate through a

  9 16 undertaken by that regulatory official provided that all of the
  9 17 following occur:
  9 18    a.  The commissioner's cooperation is in compliance with the
  9 19 laws of this state.
  9 20    b.  The regulatory official acknowledged as the group=wide
  9 21 supervisor of the internationally active insurance group also
  9 22 recognizes and cooperates with the commissioner's activities
  9 23 as a group=wide supervisor for other internationally active

  9 30 state, federal, or international regulatory agency for members
  9 31 of the internationally active insurance group, that provides
  9 32 the basis for or otherwise clarifies another regulatory
  9 33 official's role as group=wide supervisor of an internationally
  9 34 active insurance group.
  9 35    8.  An insurer registered under section 521A.4 that is
 10  1 subject to this section shall be liable for and shall pay the
 10  2 reasonable expenses of the commissioner's participation in
 10  3 the administration of this section, including the engagement

  5 19 or the commissioner may acknowledge that a regulatory official
  5 20 from another jurisdiction is the appropriate group=wide
  5 21 supervisor for the internationally active insurance group.  In
  5 22 making a determination or acknowledgment under this paragraph
  5 23 "a", the commissioner shall consider the following factors:

  6  9 or seeking to act as the group=wide supervisor for the
  6 10 internationally active insurance group provides the
  6 11 commissioner with reasonably reciprocal recognition and
  6 12 cooperation.
  6 13    b.  Notwithstanding paragraph "a", even if the commissioner
  6 14 is identified pursuant to this subsection as the group=wide
  6 15 supervisor of an internationally active insurance group,
  6 16 the commissioner may determine that it is appropriate to
  6 17 acknowledge another regulatory official to serve as the
  6 18 group=wide supervisor of the internationally active insurance
  6 19 group.
  6 20    c.  The acknowledgment of a group=wide supervisor pursuant

  5 17 for an internationally active insurance group that conducts
  5 18 substantial insurance operations concentrated in this state,
  5 19 or the commissioner may acknowledge that a regulatory official
  5 20 from another jurisdiction is the appropriate group=wide
  5 21 supervisor for the internationally active insurance group.  In
  5 22 making a determination or acknowledgment under this paragraph
  5 23 "a", the commissioner shall consider the following factors:
  5 24    (1)  The place of domicile of the insurers within the
  5 25 internationally active insurance group that hold the largest
  5 26 share of the group's written premiums, assets, or liabilities.
  5 27    (2)  The place of domicile of the top=tiered insurers in the
  5 28 insurance holding company system of the internationally active
  5 29 insurance group.
  5 30    (3)  The location of the executive offices or largest
  5 31 operational offices of the internationally active insurance

  6  1 system that the commissioner determines to be either of the
  6  2 following:
  6  3    (a)  Substantially similar to the system of regulation
  6  4 provided under the laws of this state.
  6  5    (b)  Otherwise sufficient in terms of providing for
  6  6 group=wide supervision, enterprise risk analysis, and
  6  7 cooperation with other regulatory officials.
  6  8    (5)  Whether another regulatory official acting as
  6  9 or seeking to act as the group=wide supervisor for the
  6 10 internationally active insurance group provides the
  6 11 commissioner with reasonably reciprocal recognition and

  6 13    b.  Notwithstanding paragraph "a", even if the commissioner

  6 16 the commissioner may determine that it is appropriate to
  6 17 acknowledge another regulatory official to serve as the
  6 18 group=wide supervisor of the internationally active insurance
  6 19 group.
  6 20    c.  The acknowledgment of a group=wide supervisor pursuant
  6 21 to this subsection shall be made after consideration of the
  6 22 factors listed in paragraph "a", subparagraphs (1) through
  6 23 (5), and shall be made in cooperation with and subject to the
  6 24 acknowledgment of other regulatory officials involved with
  6 25 supervision of members of the internationally active insurance
  6 26 group, and in consultation with the internationally active
  6 27 insurance group.
  6 28    3.  Notwithstanding any other provision of law, when another
  6 29 regulatory official is acting as the group=wide supervisor of
  6 30 an internationally active insurance group, the commissioner
  6 31 shall acknowledge that regulatory official as the group=wide
  6 32 supervisor of the internationally active insurance group.
  6 33 However, the commissioner shall make a new determination or
  6 34 acknowledgment as to the appropriate group=wide supervisor for
  6 35 the internationally active insurance group in the event that a
  7  1 material change in the internationally active insurance group
  7  2 results in either of the following:
  7  3    a.  The internationally active insurance group's insurers
  7  4 domiciled in Iowa holding the largest share of the group's
  7  5 premiums, assets, or liabilities.

  7 13 supervisor of an internationally active insurance group or
  7 14 to acknowledge another regulatory official to act as the
  7 15 group=wide supervisor of the internationally active insurance
  7 16 group. Prior to issuing a determination or acknowledgment
  7 17 pursuant to this section, the commissioner shall notify the
  7 18 insurer registered pursuant to section 521A.4 and the ultimate
  7 19 controlling person within the internationally active insurance
  7 20 group of the pending determination or acknowledgment. The
  7 21 insurer and the internationally active insurance group shall
  7 22 have not less than thirty days to provide the commissioner with
  7 23 additional information pertinent to the commissioner's pending
  7 24 determination or acknowledgment. The commissioner shall
  7 25 publish the identity of the internationally active insurance
  7 26 groups that the commissioner has determined are subject to
  7 27 group=wide supervision by the commissioner.
  7 28    5.  If a determination is made that the commissioner is the
  7 29 appropriate group=wide supervisor for an internationally active
  7 30 insurance group, the commissioner is authorized to engage in
  7 31 any of the following group=wide supervision activities:
  7 32    a.  Assessing the enterprise risks within the internationally
  7 33 active insurance group to ensure all of the following:

  8  3    (2)  That reasonable and effective mitigation measures are
  8  4 in place.
  8  5    b.  Requesting, from any member of an internationally active
  8  6 insurance group subject to the commissioner's group=wide
  8  7 supervision, information necessary and appropriate to assess
  8  8 enterprise risk, including but not limited to information about
  8  9 the members of the internationally active insurance group
  8 10 regarding all of the following:
  8 11    (1)  Governance, risk assessment, and management.
  8 12    (2)  Capital adequacy.
  8 13    (3)  Material intercompany transactions.
  8 14    c.  Coordinating and, through the authority of the
  8 15 regulatory officials of the jurisdictions where members of
  8 16 the internationally active insurance group are domiciled,
  8 17 compelling the development and implementation of reasonable

  8 20 enterprise risks to members of the internationally active
  8 21 insurance group that are engaged in the business of insurance.
  8 22    d.  Communicating with other state, federal, and
  8 23 international regulatory agencies for members within the
  8 24 internationally active insurance group and sharing relevant
  8 25 information, subject to the confidentiality provisions of
  8 26 section 521A.7, through supervisory colleges as set forth in
  8 27 section 521A.6A or otherwise.
  8 28    e.  Entering into agreements with or obtaining documentation

  8 30 of an internationally active insurance group, and any other
  8 31 state, federal, or international regulatory agency for members
  8 32 of the internationally active insurance group, that provides
  8 33 the basis for or otherwise clarifies the commissioner's role as
  8 34 group=wide supervisor of an internationally active insurance
  8 35 group, including provisions for resolving disputes with other
  9  1 regulatory officials. Such agreements or documentation shall
  9  2 not serve as evidence in any proceeding that any insurer or
  9  3 person within an insurance company holding company system not
  9  4 domiciled or incorporated in this state is doing business in
  9  5 this state or is otherwise subject to jurisdiction in this
  9  6 state.
  9  7    f.  Other activities of group=wide supervision, consistent
  9  8 with the authority and purposes set forth in this section, as

  9 11 official from a jurisdiction that is not accredited by the
  9 12 national association of insurance commissioners is the
  9 13 group=wide supervisor of an internationally active insurance

  9 20    b.  The regulatory official acknowledged as the group=wide
  9 21 supervisor of the internationally active insurance group also
  9 22 recognizes and cooperates with the commissioner's activities
  9 23 as a group=wide supervisor for other internationally active
  9 24 insurance groups, where applicable.  If such recognition and
  9 25 cooperation is not reasonably reciprocal, the commissioner may
  9 26 refuse recognition and cooperation to that regulatory official.
  9 27    7.  The commissioner is authorized to enter into agreements
  9 28 with or obtain documentation from any insurer registered under
  9 29 section 521A.4, any affiliate of the insurer, and any other
  9 30 state, federal, or international regulatory agency for members
  9 31 of the internationally active insurance group, that provides
  9 32 the basis for or otherwise clarifies another regulatory
  9 33 official's role as group=wide supervisor of an internationally
  9 34 active insurance group.
  9 35    8.  An insurer registered under section 521A.4 that is
 10  1 subject to this section shall be liable for and shall pay the
 10  2 reasonable expenses of the commissioner's participation in
 10  3 the administration of this section, including the engagement
 10  4 of attorneys, actuaries, accountants, and other experts not

 10  7 direction and control of the commissioner and shall act in a
 10  8 purely advisory capacity.
 10  9    9.  The commissioner shall adopt rules pursuant to chapter

 10 17   5 17 for an internationally active insurance group that conducts
  5 18 substantial insurance operations concentrated in this state,
  5 19 or the commissioner may acknowledge that a regulatory official
  5 20 from another jurisdiction is the appropriate group=wide

  6  7 cooperation with other regulatory officials.
  6  8    (5)  Whether another regulatory official acting as
  6  9 or seeking to act as the group=wide supervisor for the
  6 10 internationally active insurance group provides the
  6 11 commissioner with reasonably reciprocal recognition and
  6 12 cooperation.
  6 13    b.  Notwithstanding paragraph "a", even if the commissioner
  6 14 is identified pursuant to this subsection as the group=wide

  6 17 acknowledge another regulatory official to serve as the
  6 18 group=wide supervisor of the internationally active insurance
  6 19 group.
  6 20    c.  The acknowledgment of a group=wide supervisor pursuant
  6 21 to this subsection shall be made after consideration of the
  6 22 factors listed in paragraph "a", subparagraphs (1) through
  6 23 (5), and shall be made in cooperation with and subject to the

  6 34 acknowledgment as to the appropriate group=wide supervisor for
  6 35 the internationally active insurance group in the event that a
  7  1 material change in the internationally active insurance group
  7  2 results in either of the following:

  7  4 domiciled in Iowa holding the largest share of the group's
  7  5 premiums, assets, or liabilities.

  9  2 not serve as evidence in any proceeding that any insurer or
  9  3 person within an insurance company holding company system not
  9  4 domiciled or incorporated in this state is doing business in
  9  5 this state or is otherwise subject to jurisdiction in this

 10 17   5 19 or the commissioner may acknowledge that a regulatory official
  5 20 from another jurisdiction is the appropriate group=wide
  5 21 supervisor for the internationally active insurance group.  In
  5 22 making a determination or acknowledgment under this paragraph
  5 23 "a", the commissioner shall consider the following factors:

  5 25 internationally active insurance group that hold the largest
  5 26 share of the group's written premiums, assets, or liabilities.

  6  1 system that the commissioner determines to be either of the
  6  2 following:

  6  4 provided under the laws of this state.
  6  5    (b)  Otherwise sufficient in terms of providing for
  6  6 group=wide supervision, enterprise risk analysis, and
  6  7 cooperation with other regulatory officials.
  6  8    (5)  Whether another regulatory official acting as
  6  9 or seeking to act as the group=wide supervisor for the
  6 10 internationally active insurance group provides the
  6 11 commissioner with reasonably reciprocal recognition and
  6 12 cooperation.
  6 13    b.  Notwithstanding paragraph "a", even if the commissioner
  6 14 is identified pursuant to this subsection as the group=wide
  6 15 supervisor of an internationally active insurance group,
  6 16 the commissioner may determine that it is appropriate to
  6 17 acknowledge another regulatory official to serve as the
  6 18 group=wide supervisor of the internationally active insurance
  6 19 group.
  6 20    c.  The acknowledgment of a group=wide supervisor pursuant
  6 21 to this subsection shall be made after consideration of the
  6 22 factors listed in paragraph "a", subparagraphs (1) through
  6 23 (5), and shall be made in cooperation with and subject to the

  6 33 However, the commissioner shall make a new determination or
  6 34 acknowledgment as to the appropriate group=wide supervisor for
  6 35 the internationally active insurance group in the event that a
  7  1 material change in the internationally active insurance group
  7  2 results in either of the following:
  7  3    a.  The internationally active insurance group's insurers
  7  4 domiciled in Iowa holding the largest share of the group's
  7  5 premiums, assets, or liabilities.
  7  6    b.  Iowa being the place of domicile of the top=tiered
  7  7 insurers in the insurance holding company system of the
  7  8 internationally active insurance group.
  7  9    4.  Pursuant to section 521A.6, the commissioner is

  7 13 supervisor of an internationally active insurance group or
  7 14 to acknowledge another regulatory official to act as the
  7 15 group=wide supervisor of the internationally active insurance
  7 16 group. Prior to issuing a determination or acknowledgment
  7 17 pursuant to this section, the commissioner shall notify the

  7 13 supervisor of an internationally active insurance group or
  7 14 to acknowledge another regulatory official to act as the
  7 15 group=wide supervisor of the internationally active insurance
  7 16 group. Prior to issuing a determination or acknowledgment
  7 17 pursuant to this section, the commissioner shall notify the
  7 18 insurer registered pursuant to section 521A.4 and the ultimate
  7 19 controlling person within the internationally active insurance

  7 31 any of the following group=wide supervision activities:
  7 32    a.  Assessing the enterprise risks within the internationally

  8 32 of the internationally active insurance group, that provides
  8 33 the basis for or otherwise clarifies the commissioner's role as
  8 34 group=wide supervisor of an internationally active insurance
  8 35 group, including provisions for resolving disputes with other
  9  1 regulatory officials. Such agreements or documentation shall
  9  2 not serve as evidence in any proceeding that any insurer or
  9  3 person within an insurance company holding company system not
  9  4 domiciled or incorporated in this state is doing business in
  9  5 this state or is otherwise subject to jurisdiction in this
  9  6 state.

  9 27    7.  The commissioner is authorized to enter into agreements
  9 28 with or obtain documentation from any insurer registered under

  9 30 state, federal, or international regulatory agency for members
  9 31 of the internationally active insurance group, that provides
  9 32 the basis for or otherwise clarifies another regulatory
  9 33 official's role as group=wide supervisor of an internationally
  9 34 active insurance group.
  9 35    8.  An insurer registered under section 521A.4 that is

 13 22 as a member of an insurance holding company system and the
 13 23 ultimate controlling person within the internationally active
 13 24 insurance group as necessary for the commissioner to determine
 13 25 or acknowledge who should be the group=wide supervisor.
