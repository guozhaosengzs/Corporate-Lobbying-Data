 16 10                           EXPLANATION
 16 11 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
 16 12 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
 16 13    This bill relates to economic development by modifying life
 16 14 cycle cost analysis provisions relating to public facilities,
 16 15 specifying the state matching funds available for payment of
 16 16 intern wages under the science, technology, engineering, and
 16 17 mathematics internship program, modifying provisions related
 16 18 to reinvestment districts and to flood mitigation projects,
 16 19 modifying provisions concerning enterprise zones, and modifying
 16 20 provisions and establishing a program relating to nuisance
 16 21 property and abandoned buildings.
 16 22    Division I of the bill modifies provisions relating to the
 16 23 life cycle analysis required of certain public facilities.
 16 24 The division adds a definition of "addition" and modifies the
 16 25 definitions of "facility" and "renovation" and requires a
 16 26 public agency responsible for the construction or renovation
 16 27 of a facility or the construction of an addition to a facility
 16 28 to include the performance of a life cycle cost analysis as
 16 29 a design criterion on or after the effective date of the
 16 30 division.  The division requires a public agency or person
 16 31 preparing a life cycle cost analysis for a public agency to
 16 32 use methodology established, by rule, by the state building
 16 33 code commissioner, rather than methods and analytical
 16 34 models provided by the economic development authority.  The
 16 35 division requires the commissioner to also adopt rules for the
 17  1 implementation and adoption of the life cycle cost analysis.
 17  2    Division II of the bill amends language relating to wages
 17  3 paid to an intern under the science, technology, engineering,
 17  4 and mathematics internship program to specify that an Iowa
 17  5 employer may receive financial assistance from the state on a
 17  6 matching basis.  The division provides that if the authority
 17  7 offers financial assistance for a student at a small or
 17  8 medium sized Iowa firm that is an innovative business or for
 17  9 a science, technology, engineering, or mathematics student
 17 10 working with an Iowa employer, for every $2 earned by the
 17 11 student in wages, the employer's payment of $1 shall be
 17 12 matched by the authority with $1 on a reimbursement basis.
 17 13 The division requires the authority to administer the two
 17 14 components of the internship program in as similar a manner
 17 15 as possible. The division authorizes the authority to adopt
 17 16 emergency rules for this division of the bill.  The division
 17 17 takes effect upon enactment and applies retroactively to
 17 18 contracts for financial assistance entered into on or after
 17 19 July 1, 2014.
 17 20    Division III of the bill relates to reinvestment districts
 17 21 under Code chapter 15J and flood mitigation projects under
 17 22 Code chapter 418.  The division eliminates the prohibition on
 17 23 the flood mitigation board approving an amendment on or after
 17 24 July 1, 2018, to an existing district's plan.  The division
 17 25 modifies the definition of "governmental entity" for purposes
 17 26 of a flood mitigation project to include a joint board or other
 17 27 legal or administrative entity formed by a Code chapter 28F
 17 28 agreement entered into by one or more counties, one or more
 17 29 cities at least partly within the counties, and one or more
 17 30 Code chapter 358 sanitary districts or a combined water and
 17 31 sanitary district established by Code chapter 357 or 358 and
 17 32 located at least partly within the city or county.
 17 33    The division provides that, for purposes of funding a
 17 34 flood mitigation project, the sales tax increment area shall
 17 35 not include any parcels that are included in a reinvestment
 18  1 district established under Code chapter 15J.
 18  2    The division provides that transfers of sales tax increment
 18  3 revenue to a reinvestment district account shall be made
 18  4 prior to transfer of sales tax increment revenue to a flood
 18  5 mitigation project account. The division also provides that
 18  6 from the amounts transferred to reinvestment district accounts
 18  7 and flood mitigation project accounts the department of revenue
 18  8 shall retain the lesser of $25,000 or the actual cost of
 18  9 administering the specified transfers of sales tax increment
 18 10 revenue quarterly as a repayment receipt.  The bill provides
 18 11 the process for the retention of the revenue.
 18 12    The division is effective upon enactment.  The division
 18 13 applies retroactively to reinvestment districts designated
 18 14 under Code chapter 15J in existence on or after July 1, 2014,
 18 15 and flood mitigation project plan applications received before,
 18 16 on, or after the effective date of the division.  The sections
 18 17 of the division amending Code section 423.2, regarding the
 18 18 transfers of sales tax increment revenue to a reinvestment
 18 19 district and to a flood mitigation project account as well as
 18 20 the retention of repayment receipts, apply to transfers of
 18 21 sales tax revenues made on or after July 1, 2015.
 18 22    Division IV of the bill relates to enterprise zones.  The
 18 23 division allows a city or county and the economic development
 18 24 authority for compliance reasons to amend agreements made under
 18 25 the enterprise zone program as long as the amendments do not
 18 26 increase the amount of incentives awarded and the economic
 18 27 development authority board approves.
 18 28    Division V of the bill relates to nuisance properties
 18 29 and abandoned buildings. The division requires the economic
 18 30 development authority to establish a nuisance property
 18 31 remediation fund for the purpose of providing financial
 18 32 assistance to cities for the remediation of nuisance
 18 33 properties, abandoned buildings, and other structures.  The
 18 34 division provides that moneys in a fund established in the high
 18 35 quality jobs program may be deposited in the nuisance property
 19  1 remediation fund.  The division allows the authority to operate
 19  2 the fund as a revolving fund and to use moneys in the fund for
 19  3 purposes of the program, or the authority may transfer the
 19  4 moneys to other funds it has created.  However, the division
 19  5 states that the authority must use any money specifically
 19  6 appropriated for nuisance property remediation assistance for
 19  7 the program.  Moneys in the fund consist of appropriations and
 19  8 any other moneys lawfully available to the authority.  The
 19  9 authority may provide this assistance using a competitive
 19 10 scoring process.  The division requires the authority to enter
 19 11 into an agreement with the city concerning the assistance.  The
 19 12 division allows the authority to grant priority to cities with
 19 13 severe blighted areas, widespread dilapidated housing stock, or
 19 14 high rates of low and moderate income residents.
 19 15    Division V also makes changes to the authority of cities and
 19 16 counties relating to certain abandoned or unsafe buildings.
 19 17 Code chapter 657A allows a city or county to take action
 19 18 to abate by rehabilitation a building used primarily for
 19 19 residential purposes that meets the statutory definition of
 19 20 "abandoned" or "public nuisance", as those terms are defined
 19 21 by the Iowa Code.  The costs associated with rehabilitating
 19 22 the building that remain unpaid by the owner create a mortgage
 19 23 lien against the property.  In lieu of abatement through
 19 24 rehabilitation, Code section 657A.10A allows a city to file
 19 25 an action in district court to take title to an abandoned
 19 26 building.  The court may award title to the petitioning city if
 19 27 the court finds that the building is abandoned, using factors
 19 28 established in statute, or if the city establishes that all
 19 29 interested parties received proper notice and the interested
 19 30 parties either consented to the title transfer or had taken no
 19 31 action to comply with local housing official orders within 60
 19 32 days after the filing of the petition.
 19 33    The division amends the definition of "building" in Code
 19 34 section 657A.1 to include buildings used or intended to be used
 19 35 for commercial or industrial purposes and makes corresponding
 20  1 amendments to refer to the local building code or local housing
 20  2 code, as applicable.
 20  3    Currently, Code section 657A.10A requires that service
 20  4 of notice of the filing of the petition for title be made
 20  5 on interested parties by certified mail and by posting on
 20  6 the building.  The division provides that service shall be
 20  7 by personal service or certified mail or, if service cannot
 20  8 be made by either method, by posting on the building and
 20  9 publication in a newspaper of general circulation in the city.
 20 10    The division also amends Code section 657A.10A to add to the
 20 11 listing of factors for the court to consider when determining
 20 12 whether property has been abandoned.
 20 13    Division VI allows the authority to enter into an agreement
 20 14 for a housing enterprise tax credit for certain housing
 20 15 businesses that had mailed applications to the authority prior
 20 16 to the July 1, 2014, repeal of the housing enterprise tax
 20 17 credit in Code section 15E.193B.
 20 18    The division states that the authority may enter into
 20 19 an agreement and issue housing enterprise tax credits to a
 20 20 housing business if the city or county mailed the application
 20 21 forms on or after June 1, 2014, and prior to July 1, 2014,
 20 22 but the applications were not received by the authority, the
 20 23 application forms submitted were approved by the necessary
 20 24 governing bodies and commissions, the authority determines
 20 25 the housing business would otherwise be eligible under the
 20 26 Code section that was repealed, and the city or county and the
 20 27 eligible housing business meet all other requirements of the
 20 28 housing enterprise tax credit program and of the agreement
 20 29 entered into with the economic development authority.
 20 30    The division takes effect upon enactment and applies
 20 31 retroactively to July 1, 2014.

 16  9 Act applies retroactively to July 1, 2014.
 16 10                           EXPLANATION
 16 11 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
 16 12 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
 16 13    This bill relates to economic development by modifying life
 16 14 cycle cost analysis provisions relating to public facilities,
 16 15 specifying the state matching funds available for payment of
 16 16 intern wages under the science, technology, engineering, and
 16 17 mathematics internship program, modifying provisions related
 16 18 to reinvestment districts and to flood mitigation projects,
 16 19 modifying provisions concerning enterprise zones, and modifying
 16 20 provisions and establishing a program relating to nuisance
 16 21 property and abandoned buildings.
 16 22    Division I of the bill modifies provisions relating to the
 16 23 life cycle analysis required of certain public facilities.
 16 24 The division adds a definition of "addition" and modifies the
 16 25 definitions of "facility" and "renovation" and requires a
 16 26 public agency responsible for the construction or renovation
 16 27 of a facility or the construction of an addition to a facility
 16 28 to include the performance of a life cycle cost analysis as
 16 29 a design criterion on or after the effective date of the
 16 30 division.  The division requires a public agency or person
 16 31 preparing a life cycle cost analysis for a public agency to
 16 32 use methodology established, by rule, by the state building
 16 33 code commissioner, rather than methods and analytical
 16 34 models provided by the economic development authority.  The
 16 35 division requires the commissioner to also adopt rules for the
 17  1 implementation and adoption of the life cycle cost analysis.
 17  2    Division II of the bill amends language relating to wages
 17  3 paid to an intern under the science, technology, engineering,
 17  4 and mathematics internship program to specify that an Iowa
 17  5 employer may receive financial assistance from the state on a
 17  6 matching basis.  The division provides that if the authority
 17  7 offers financial assistance for a student at a small or
 17  8 medium sized Iowa firm that is an innovative business or for
 17  9 a science, technology, engineering, or mathematics student
 17 10 working with an Iowa employer, for every $2 earned by the
 17 11 student in wages, the employer's payment of $1 shall be
 17 12 matched by the authority with $1 on a reimbursement basis.
 17 13 The division requires the authority to administer the two
 17 14 components of the internship program in as similar a manner
 17 15 as possible. The division authorizes the authority to adopt
 17 16 emergency rules for this division of the bill.  The division
 17 17 takes effect upon enactment and applies retroactively to
 17 18 contracts for financial assistance entered into on or after
 17 19 July 1, 2014.
 17 20    Division III of the bill relates to reinvestment districts
 17 21 under Code chapter 15J and flood mitigation projects under
 17 22 Code chapter 418.  The division eliminates the prohibition on
 17 23 the flood mitigation board approving an amendment on or after
 17 24 July 1, 2018, to an existing district's plan.  The division
 17 25 modifies the definition of "governmental entity" for purposes
 17 26 of a flood mitigation project to include a joint board or other
 17 27 legal or administrative entity formed by a Code chapter 28F
 17 28 agreement entered into by one or more counties, one or more
 17 29 cities at least partly within the counties, and one or more
 17 30 Code chapter 358 sanitary districts or a combined water and
 17 31 sanitary district established by Code chapter 357 or 358 and
 17 32 located at least partly within the city or county.
 17 33    The division provides that, for purposes of funding a
 17 34 flood mitigation project, the sales tax increment area shall
 17 35 not include any parcels that are included in a reinvestment
 18  1 district established under Code chapter 15J.
 18  2    The division provides that transfers of sales tax increment
 18  3 revenue to a reinvestment district account shall be made
 18  4 prior to transfer of sales tax increment revenue to a flood
 18  5 mitigation project account. The division also provides that
 18  6 from the amounts transferred to reinvestment district accounts
 18  7 and flood mitigation project accounts the department of revenue
 18  8 shall retain the lesser of $25,000 or the actual cost of
 18  9 administering the specified transfers of sales tax increment
 18 10 revenue quarterly as a repayment receipt.  The bill provides
 18 11 the process for the retention of the revenue.
 18 12    The division is effective upon enactment.  The division
 18 13 applies retroactively to reinvestment districts designated
 18 14 under Code chapter 15J in existence on or after July 1, 2014,
 18 15 and flood mitigation project plan applications received before,
 18 16 on, or after the effective date of the division.  The sections
 18 17 of the division amending Code section 423.2, regarding the
 18 18 transfers of sales tax increment revenue to a reinvestment
 18 19 district and to a flood mitigation project account as well as
 18 20 the retention of repayment receipts, apply to transfers of
 18 21 sales tax revenues made on or after July 1, 2015.
 18 22    Division IV of the bill relates to enterprise zones.  The
 18 23 division allows a city or county and the economic development
 18 24 authority for compliance reasons to amend agreements made under
 18 25 the enterprise zone program as long as the amendments do not
 18 26 increase the amount of incentives awarded and the economic
 18 27 development authority board approves.
 18 28    Division V of the bill relates to nuisance properties
 18 29 and abandoned buildings. The division requires the economic
 18 30 development authority to establish a nuisance property
 18 31 remediation fund for the purpose of providing financial
 18 32 assistance to cities for the remediation of nuisance
 18 33 properties, abandoned buildings, and other structures.  The
 18 34 division provides that moneys in a fund established in the high
 18 35 quality jobs program may be deposited in the nuisance property
 19  1 remediation fund.  The division allows the authority to operate
 19  2 the fund as a revolving fund and to use moneys in the fund for
 19  3 purposes of the program, or the authority may transfer the
 19  4 moneys to other funds it has created.  However, the division
 19  5 states that the authority must use any money specifically
 19  6 appropriated for nuisance property remediation assistance for
 19  7 the program.  Moneys in the fund consist of appropriations and
 19  8 any other moneys lawfully available to the authority.  The
 19  9 authority may provide this assistance using a competitive
 19 10 scoring process.  The division requires the authority to enter
 19 11 into an agreement with the city concerning the assistance.  The
 19 12 division allows the authority to grant priority to cities with
 19 13 severe blighted areas, widespread dilapidated housing stock, or
 19 14 high rates of low and moderate income residents.
 19 15    Division V also makes changes to the authority of cities and
 19 16 counties relating to certain abandoned or unsafe buildings.
 19 17 Code chapter 657A allows a city or county to take action
 19 18 to abate by rehabilitation a building used primarily for
 19 19 residential purposes that meets the statutory definition of
 19 20 "abandoned" or "public nuisance", as those terms are defined
 19 21 by the Iowa Code.  The costs associated with rehabilitating
 19 22 the building that remain unpaid by the owner create a mortgage
 19 23 lien against the property.  In lieu of abatement through
 19 24 rehabilitation, Code section 657A.10A allows a city to file
 19 25 an action in district court to take title to an abandoned
 19 26 building.  The court may award title to the petitioning city if
 19 27 the court finds that the building is abandoned, using factors
 19 28 established in statute, or if the city establishes that all
 19 29 interested parties received proper notice and the interested
 19 30 parties either consented to the title transfer or had taken no
 19 31 action to comply with local housing official orders within 60
 19 32 days after the filing of the petition.
 19 33    The division amends the definition of "building" in Code
 19 34 section 657A.1 to include buildings used or intended to be used
 19 35 for commercial or industrial purposes and makes corresponding
 20  1 amendments to refer to the local building code or local housing
 20  2 code, as applicable.
 20  3    Currently, Code section 657A.10A requires that service
 20  4 of notice of the filing of the petition for title be made
 20  5 on interested parties by certified mail and by posting on
 20  6 the building.  The division provides that service shall be
 20  7 by personal service or certified mail or, if service cannot
 20  8 be made by either method, by posting on the building and
 20  9 publication in a newspaper of general circulation in the city.
 20 10    The division also amends Code section 657A.10A to add to the
 20 11 listing of factors for the court to consider when determining
 20 12 whether property has been abandoned.
 20 13    Division VI allows the authority to enter into an agreement
 20 14 for a housing enterprise tax credit for certain housing
 20 15 businesses that had mailed applications to the authority prior
 20 16 to the July 1, 2014, repeal of the housing enterprise tax
 20 17 credit in Code section 15E.193B.
 20 18    The division states that the authority may enter into
 20 19 an agreement and issue housing enterprise tax credits to a
 20 20 housing business if the city or county mailed the application
 20 21 forms on or after June 1, 2014, and prior to July 1, 2014,
 20 22 but the applications were not received by the authority, the
 20 23 application forms submitted were approved by the necessary
 20 24 governing bodies and commissions, the authority determines
 20 25 the housing business would otherwise be eligible under the
 20 26 Code section that was repealed, and the city or county and the
 20 27 eligible housing business meet all other requirements of the
 20 28 housing enterprise tax credit program and of the agreement
 20 29 entered into with the economic development authority.
 20 30    The division takes effect upon enactment and applies

 16 10                           EXPLANATION
 16 11 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
 16 12 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
 16 13    This bill relates to economic development by modifying life
 16 14 cycle cost analysis provisions relating to public facilities,
 16 15 specifying the state matching funds available for payment of
 16 16 intern wages under the science, technology, engineering, and
 16 17 mathematics internship program, modifying provisions related
 16 18 to reinvestment districts and to flood mitigation projects,
 16 19 modifying provisions concerning enterprise zones, and modifying
 16 20 provisions and establishing a program relating to nuisance
 16 21 property and abandoned buildings.
 16 22    Division I of the bill modifies provisions relating to the
 16 23 life cycle analysis required of certain public facilities.
 16 24 The division adds a definition of "addition" and modifies the
 16 25 definitions of "facility" and "renovation" and requires a
 16 26 public agency responsible for the construction or renovation
 16 27 of a facility or the construction of an addition to a facility
 16 28 to include the performance of a life cycle cost analysis as
 16 29 a design criterion on or after the effective date of the
 16 30 division.  The division requires a public agency or person
 16 31 preparing a life cycle cost analysis for a public agency to
 16 32 use methodology established, by rule, by the state building
 16 33 code commissioner, rather than methods and analytical
 16 34 models provided by the economic development authority.  The
 16 35 division requires the commissioner to also adopt rules for the
 17  1 implementation and adoption of the life cycle cost analysis.
 17  2    Division II of the bill amends language relating to wages
 17  3 paid to an intern under the science, technology, engineering,
 17  4 and mathematics internship program to specify that an Iowa
 17  5 employer may receive financial assistance from the state on a
 17  6 matching basis.  The division provides that if the authority
 17  7 offers financial assistance for a student at a small or
 17  8 medium sized Iowa firm that is an innovative business or for
 17  9 a science, technology, engineering, or mathematics student
 17 10 working with an Iowa employer, for every $2 earned by the
 17 11 student in wages, the employer's payment of $1 shall be
 17 12 matched by the authority with $1 on a reimbursement basis.
 17 13 The division requires the authority to administer the two
 17 14 components of the internship program in as similar a manner
 17 15 as possible. The division authorizes the authority to adopt
 17 16 emergency rules for this division of the bill.  The division
 17 17 takes effect upon enactment and applies retroactively to
 17 18 contracts for financial assistance entered into on or after

 17 22 Code chapter 418.  The division eliminates the prohibition on
 17 23 the flood mitigation board approving an amendment on or after
 17 24 July 1, 2018, to an existing district's plan.  The division
 17 25 modifies the definition of "governmental entity" for purposes
 17 26 of a flood mitigation project to include a joint board or other
 17 27 legal or administrative entity formed by a Code chapter 28F
 17 28 agreement entered into by one or more counties, one or more
 17 29 cities at least partly within the counties, and one or more
 17 30 Code chapter 358 sanitary districts or a combined water and
 17 31 sanitary district established by Code chapter 357 or 358 and
 17 32 located at least partly within the city or county.
 17 33    The division provides that, for purposes of funding a
 17 34 flood mitigation project, the sales tax increment area shall
 17 35 not include any parcels that are included in a reinvestment
 18  1 district established under Code chapter 15J.
 18  2    The division provides that transfers of sales tax increment
 18  3 revenue to a reinvestment district account shall be made
 18  4 prior to transfer of sales tax increment revenue to a flood
 18  5 mitigation project account. The division also provides that
 18  6 from the amounts transferred to reinvestment district accounts
 18  7 and flood mitigation project accounts the department of revenue
 18  8 shall retain the lesser of $25,000 or the actual cost of
 18  9 administering the specified transfers of sales tax increment
 18 10 revenue quarterly as a repayment receipt.  The bill provides
 18 11 the process for the retention of the revenue.
 18 12    The division is effective upon enactment.  The division
 18 13 applies retroactively to reinvestment districts designated
 18 14 under Code chapter 15J in existence on or after July 1, 2014,
 18 15 and flood mitigation project plan applications received before,
 18 16 on, or after the effective date of the division.  The sections
 18 17 of the division amending Code section 423.2, regarding the
 18 18 transfers of sales tax increment revenue to a reinvestment
 18 19 district and to a flood mitigation project account as well as
 18 20 the retention of repayment receipts, apply to transfers of
 18 21 sales tax revenues made on or after July 1, 2015.
 18 22    Division IV of the bill relates to enterprise zones.  The
 18 23 division allows a city or county and the economic development
 18 24 authority for compliance reasons to amend agreements made under
 18 25 the enterprise zone program as long as the amendments do not
 18 26 increase the amount of incentives awarded and the economic
 18 27 development authority board approves.
 18 28    Division V of the bill relates to nuisance properties
 18 29 and abandoned buildings. The division requires the economic
 18 30 development authority to establish a nuisance property
 18 31 remediation fund for the purpose of providing financial
 18 32 assistance to cities for the remediation of nuisance
 18 33 properties, abandoned buildings, and other structures.  The
 18 34 division provides that moneys in a fund established in the high
 18 35 quality jobs program may be deposited in the nuisance property
 19  1 remediation fund.  The division allows the authority to operate
 19  2 the fund as a revolving fund and to use moneys in the fund for
 19  3 purposes of the program, or the authority may transfer the
 19  4 moneys to other funds it has created.  However, the division
 19  5 states that the authority must use any money specifically
 19  6 appropriated for nuisance property remediation assistance for
 19  7 the program.  Moneys in the fund consist of appropriations and
 19  8 any other moneys lawfully available to the authority.  The
 19  9 authority may provide this assistance using a competitive
 19 10 scoring process.  The division requires the authority to enter
 19 11 into an agreement with the city concerning the assistance.  The
 19 12 division allows the authority to grant priority to cities with
 19 13 severe blighted areas, widespread dilapidated housing stock, or
 19 14 high rates of low and moderate income residents.
 19 15    Division V also makes changes to the authority of cities and
 19 16 counties relating to certain abandoned or unsafe buildings.
 19 17 Code chapter 657A allows a city or county to take action
 19 18 to abate by rehabilitation a building used primarily for
 19 19 residential purposes that meets the statutory definition of
 19 20 "abandoned" or "public nuisance", as those terms are defined
 19 21 by the Iowa Code.  The costs associated with rehabilitating
 19 22 the building that remain unpaid by the owner create a mortgage
 19 23 lien against the property.  In lieu of abatement through
 19 24 rehabilitation, Code section 657A.10A allows a city to file
 19 25 an action in district court to take title to an abandoned
 19 26 building.  The court may award title to the petitioning city if
 19 27 the court finds that the building is abandoned, using factors
 19 28 established in statute, or if the city establishes that all
 19 29 interested parties received proper notice and the interested
 19 30 parties either consented to the title transfer or had taken no
 19 31 action to comply with local housing official orders within 60
 19 32 days after the filing of the petition.
 19 33    The division amends the definition of "building" in Code
 19 34 section 657A.1 to include buildings used or intended to be used
 19 35 for commercial or industrial purposes and makes corresponding
 20  1 amendments to refer to the local building code or local housing
 20  2 code, as applicable.
 20  3    Currently, Code section 657A.10A requires that service
 20  4 of notice of the filing of the petition for title be made
 20  5 on interested parties by certified mail and by posting on
 20  6 the building.  The division provides that service shall be
 20  7 by personal service or certified mail or, if service cannot
 20  8 be made by either method, by posting on the building and
 20  9 publication in a newspaper of general circulation in the city.
 20 10    The division also amends Code section 657A.10A to add to the

 20 20 housing business if the city or county mailed the application
 20 21 forms on or after June 1, 2014, and prior to July 1, 2014,

 19 23 lien against the property.  In lieu of abatement through
 19 24 rehabilitation, Code section 657A.10A allows a city to file
 19 25 an action in district court to take title to an abandoned
 19 26 building.  The court may award title to the petitioning city if
 19 27 the court finds that the building is abandoned, using factors
 19 28 established in statute, or if the city establishes that all
 19 29 interested parties received proper notice and the interested
 19 30 parties either consented to the title transfer or had taken no
 19 31 action to comply with local housing official orders within 60
 19 32 days after the filing of the petition.
 19 33    The division amends the definition of "building" in Code
 19 34 section 657A.1 to include buildings used or intended to be used
 19 35 for commercial or industrial purposes and makes corresponding
 20  1 amendments to refer to the local building code or local housing
 20  2 code, as applicable.
 20  3    Currently, Code section 657A.10A requires that service
 20  4 of notice of the filing of the petition for title be made
 20  5 on interested parties by certified mail and by posting on
 20  6 the building.  The division provides that service shall be
 20  7 by personal service or certified mail or, if service cannot
 20  8 be made by either method, by posting on the building and
 20  9 publication in a newspaper of general circulation in the city.
 20 10    The division also amends Code section 657A.10A to add to the
 20 11 listing of factors for the court to consider when determining
 20 12 whether property has been abandoned.
 20 13    Division VI allows the authority to enter into an agreement
 20 14 for a housing enterprise tax credit for certain housing
 20 15 businesses that had mailed applications to the authority prior
 20 16 to the July 1, 2014, repeal of the housing enterprise tax
 20 17 credit in Code section 15E.193B.
 20 18    The division states that the authority may enter into
 20 19 an agreement and issue housing enterprise tax credits to a
 20 20 housing business if the city or county mailed the application
 20 21 forms on or after June 1, 2014, and prior to July 1, 2014,

 16 10                           EXPLANATION
 16 11 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
 16 12 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
 16 13    This bill relates to economic development by modifying life
 16 14 cycle cost analysis provisions relating to public facilities,
 16 15 specifying the state matching funds available for payment of
 16 16 intern wages under the science, technology, engineering, and
 16 17 mathematics internship program, modifying provisions related
 16 18 to reinvestment districts and to flood mitigation projects,
 16 19 modifying provisions concerning enterprise zones, and modifying
 16 20 provisions and establishing a program relating to nuisance
 16 21 property and abandoned buildings.
 16 22    Division I of the bill modifies provisions relating to the
 16 23 life cycle analysis required of certain public facilities.
 16 24 The division adds a definition of "addition" and modifies the
 16 25 definitions of "facility" and "renovation" and requires a
 16 26 public agency responsible for the construction or renovation
 16 27 of a facility or the construction of an addition to a facility
 16 28 to include the performance of a life cycle cost analysis as
 16 29 a design criterion on or after the effective date of the
 16 30 division.  The division requires a public agency or person
 16 31 preparing a life cycle cost analysis for a public agency to
 16 32 use methodology established, by rule, by the state building
 16 33 code commissioner, rather than methods and analytical
 16 34 models provided by the economic development authority.  The
 16 35 division requires the commissioner to also adopt rules for the
 17  1 implementation and adoption of the life cycle cost analysis.
 17  2    Division II of the bill amends language relating to wages
 17  3 paid to an intern under the science, technology, engineering,
 17  4 and mathematics internship program to specify that an Iowa
 17  5 employer may receive financial assistance from the state on a
 17  6 matching basis.  The division provides that if the authority
 17  7 offers financial assistance for a student at a small or
 17  8 medium sized Iowa firm that is an innovative business or for
 17  9 a science, technology, engineering, or mathematics student
 17 10 working with an Iowa employer, for every $2 earned by the
 17 11 student in wages, the employer's payment of $1 shall be
 17 12 matched by the authority with $1 on a reimbursement basis.
 17 13 The division requires the authority to administer the two
 17 14 components of the internship program in as similar a manner
 17 15 as possible. The division authorizes the authority to adopt
 17 16 emergency rules for this division of the bill.  The division
 17 17 takes effect upon enactment and applies retroactively to
 17 18 contracts for financial assistance entered into on or after
 17 19 July 1, 2014.
 17 20    Division III of the bill relates to reinvestment districts
 17 21 under Code chapter 15J and flood mitigation projects under
 17 22 Code chapter 418.  The division eliminates the prohibition on
 17 23 the flood mitigation board approving an amendment on or after
 17 24 July 1, 2018, to an existing district's plan.  The division
 17 25 modifies the definition of "governmental entity" for purposes
 17 26 of a flood mitigation project to include a joint board or other
 17 27 legal or administrative entity formed by a Code chapter 28F
 17 28 agreement entered into by one or more counties, one or more
 17 29 cities at least partly within the counties, and one or more
 17 30 Code chapter 358 sanitary districts or a combined water and
 17 31 sanitary district established by Code chapter 357 or 358 and
 17 32 located at least partly within the city or county.
 17 33    The division provides that, for purposes of funding a
 17 34 flood mitigation project, the sales tax increment area shall
 17 35 not include any parcels that are included in a reinvestment
 18  1 district established under Code chapter 15J.
 18  2    The division provides that transfers of sales tax increment
 18  3 revenue to a reinvestment district account shall be made
 18  4 prior to transfer of sales tax increment revenue to a flood
 18  5 mitigation project account. The division also provides that
 18  6 from the amounts transferred to reinvestment district accounts
 18  7 and flood mitigation project accounts the department of revenue
 18  8 shall retain the lesser of $25,000 or the actual cost of
 18  9 administering the specified transfers of sales tax increment
 18 10 revenue quarterly as a repayment receipt.  The bill provides
 18 11 the process for the retention of the revenue.
 18 12    The division is effective upon enactment.  The division
 18 13 applies retroactively to reinvestment districts designated
 18 14 under Code chapter 15J in existence on or after July 1, 2014,
 18 15 and flood mitigation project plan applications received before,
 18 16 on, or after the effective date of the division.  The sections
 18 17 of the division amending Code section 423.2, regarding the
 18 18 transfers of sales tax increment revenue to a reinvestment
 18 19 district and to a flood mitigation project account as well as
 18 20 the retention of repayment receipts, apply to transfers of
 18 21 sales tax revenues made on or after July 1, 2015.
 18 22    Division IV of the bill relates to enterprise zones.  The
 18 23 division allows a city or county and the economic development
 18 24 authority for compliance reasons to amend agreements made under
 18 25 the enterprise zone program as long as the amendments do not
 18 26 increase the amount of incentives awarded and the economic
 18 27 development authority board approves.
 18 28    Division V of the bill relates to nuisance properties
 18 29 and abandoned buildings. The division requires the economic
 18 30 development authority to establish a nuisance property
 18 31 remediation fund for the purpose of providing financial
 18 32 assistance to cities for the remediation of nuisance
 18 33 properties, abandoned buildings, and other structures.  The
 18 34 division provides that moneys in a fund established in the high
 18 35 quality jobs program may be deposited in the nuisance property
 19  1 remediation fund.  The division allows the authority to operate
 19  2 the fund as a revolving fund and to use moneys in the fund for
 19  3 purposes of the program, or the authority may transfer the
 19  4 moneys to other funds it has created.  However, the division
 19  5 states that the authority must use any money specifically
 19  6 appropriated for nuisance property remediation assistance for
 19  7 the program.  Moneys in the fund consist of appropriations and
 19  8 any other moneys lawfully available to the authority.  The
 19  9 authority may provide this assistance using a competitive
 19 10 scoring process.  The division requires the authority to enter
 19 11 into an agreement with the city concerning the assistance.  The
 19 12 division allows the authority to grant priority to cities with
 19 13 severe blighted areas, widespread dilapidated housing stock, or
 19 14 high rates of low and moderate income residents.
 19 15    Division V also makes changes to the authority of cities and
 19 16 counties relating to certain abandoned or unsafe buildings.
 19 17 Code chapter 657A allows a city or county to take action
 19 18 to abate by rehabilitation a building used primarily for
 19 19 residential purposes that meets the statutory definition of
 19 20 "abandoned" or "public nuisance", as those terms are defined
 19 21 by the Iowa Code.  The costs associated with rehabilitating
 19 22 the building that remain unpaid by the owner create a mortgage
 19 23 lien against the property.  In lieu of abatement through
 19 24 rehabilitation, Code section 657A.10A allows a city to file
 19 25 an action in district court to take title to an abandoned
 19 26 building.  The court may award title to the petitioning city if
 19 27 the court finds that the building is abandoned, using factors
 19 28 established in statute, or if the city establishes that all
 19 29 interested parties received proper notice and the interested
 19 30 parties either consented to the title transfer or had taken no
 19 31 action to comply with local housing official orders within 60
 19 32 days after the filing of the petition.
 19 33    The division amends the definition of "building" in Code
 19 34 section 657A.1 to include buildings used or intended to be used
 19 35 for commercial or industrial purposes and makes corresponding
 20  1 amendments to refer to the local building code or local housing
 20  2 code, as applicable.
 20  3    Currently, Code section 657A.10A requires that service
 20  4 of notice of the filing of the petition for title be made
 20  5 on interested parties by certified mail and by posting on
 20  6 the building.  The division provides that service shall be
 20  7 by personal service or certified mail or, if service cannot
 20  8 be made by either method, by posting on the building and
 20  9 publication in a newspaper of general circulation in the city.
 20 10    The division also amends Code section 657A.10A to add to the
 20 11 listing of factors for the court to consider when determining
 20 12 whether property has been abandoned.
 20 13    Division VI allows the authority to enter into an agreement
 20 14 for a housing enterprise tax credit for certain housing
 20 15 businesses that had mailed applications to the authority prior
 20 16 to the July 1, 2014, repeal of the housing enterprise tax
 20 17 credit in Code section 15E.193B.
 20 18    The division states that the authority may enter into
 20 19 an agreement and issue housing enterprise tax credits to a
 20 20 housing business if the city or county mailed the application
 20 21 forms on or after June 1, 2014, and prior to July 1, 2014,
 20 22 but the applications were not received by the authority, the
 20 23 application forms submitted were approved by the necessary
 20 24 governing bodies and commissions, the authority determines
 20 25 the housing business would otherwise be eligible under the
 20 26 Code section that was repealed, and the city or county and the
 20 27 eligible housing business meet all other requirements of the
 20 28 housing enterprise tax credit program and of the agreement
 20 29 entered into with the economic development authority.
 20 30    The division takes effect upon enactment and applies
 20 31 retroactively to July 1, 2014.

 17 25 modifies the definition of "governmental entity" for purposes
 17 26 of a flood mitigation project to include a joint board or other
 17 27 legal or administrative entity formed by a Code chapter 28F
 17 28 agreement entered into by one or more counties, one or more
 17 29 cities at least partly within the counties, and one or more
 17 30 Code chapter 358 sanitary districts or a combined water and
 17 31 sanitary district established by Code chapter 357 or 358 and
 17 32 located at least partly within the city or county.
 17 33    The division provides that, for purposes of funding a

 18  2    The division provides that transfers of sales tax increment
 18  3 revenue to a reinvestment district account shall be made
 18  4 prior to transfer of sales tax increment revenue to a flood

 18  6 from the amounts transferred to reinvestment district accounts
 18  7 and flood mitigation project accounts the department of revenue
 18  8 shall retain the lesser of $25,000 or the actual cost of
 18  9 administering the specified transfers of sales tax increment
 18 10 revenue quarterly as a repayment receipt.  The bill provides
 18 11 the process for the retention of the revenue.
 18 12    The division is effective upon enactment.  The division
 18 13 applies retroactively to reinvestment districts designated
 18 14 under Code chapter 15J in existence on or after July 1, 2014,
 18 15 and flood mitigation project plan applications received before,
 18 16 on, or after the effective date of the division.  The sections
 18 17 of the division amending Code section 423.2, regarding the
 18 18 transfers of sales tax increment revenue to a reinvestment
 18 19 district and to a flood mitigation project account as well as
 18 20 the retention of repayment receipts, apply to transfers of
 18 21 sales tax revenues made on or after July 1, 2015.
 18 22    Division IV of the bill relates to enterprise zones.  The
 18 23 division allows a city or county and the economic development
 18 24 authority for compliance reasons to amend agreements made under
 18 25 the enterprise zone program as long as the amendments do not
 18 26 increase the amount of incentives awarded and the economic
 18 27 development authority board approves.
 18 28    Division V of the bill relates to nuisance properties
 18 29 and abandoned buildings. The division requires the economic
 18 30 development authority to establish a nuisance property
 18 31 remediation fund for the purpose of providing financial
 18 32 assistance to cities for the remediation of nuisance
 18 33 properties, abandoned buildings, and other structures.  The
 18 34 division provides that moneys in a fund established in the high
 18 35 quality jobs program may be deposited in the nuisance property
 19  1 remediation fund.  The division allows the authority to operate
 19  2 the fund as a revolving fund and to use moneys in the fund for
 19  3 purposes of the program, or the authority may transfer the
 19  4 moneys to other funds it has created.  However, the division
 19  5 states that the authority must use any money specifically
 19  6 appropriated for nuisance property remediation assistance for
 19  7 the program.  Moneys in the fund consist of appropriations and
 19  8 any other moneys lawfully available to the authority.  The
 19  9 authority may provide this assistance using a competitive
 19 10 scoring process.  The division requires the authority to enter
 19 11 into an agreement with the city concerning the assistance.  The
 19 12 division allows the authority to grant priority to cities with
 19 13 severe blighted areas, widespread dilapidated housing stock, or
 19 14 high rates of low and moderate income residents.
 19 15    Division V also makes changes to the authority of cities and
 19 16 counties relating to certain abandoned or unsafe buildings.
 19 17 Code chapter 657A allows a city or county to take action
 19 18 to abate by rehabilitation a building used primarily for
 19 19 residential purposes that meets the statutory definition of
 19 20 "abandoned" or "public nuisance", as those terms are defined
 19 21 by the Iowa Code.  The costs associated with rehabilitating
 19 22 the building that remain unpaid by the owner create a mortgage
 19 23 lien against the property.  In lieu of abatement through
 19 24 rehabilitation, Code section 657A.10A allows a city to file
 19 25 an action in district court to take title to an abandoned
 19 26 building.  The court may award title to the petitioning city if
 19 27 the court finds that the building is abandoned, using factors
 19 28 established in statute, or if the city establishes that all
 19 29 interested parties received proper notice and the interested
 19 30 parties either consented to the title transfer or had taken no
 19 31 action to comply with local housing official orders within 60
 19 32 days after the filing of the petition.
 19 33    The division amends the definition of "building" in Code
 19 34 section 657A.1 to include buildings used or intended to be used
 19 35 for commercial or industrial purposes and makes corresponding
 20  1 amendments to refer to the local building code or local housing
 20  2 code, as applicable.
 20  3    Currently, Code section 657A.10A requires that service
 20  4 of notice of the filing of the petition for title be made
 20  5 on interested parties by certified mail and by posting on
 20  6 the building.  The division provides that service shall be
 20  7 by personal service or certified mail or, if service cannot
 20  8 be made by either method, by posting on the building and
 20  9 publication in a newspaper of general circulation in the city.
 20 10    The division also amends Code section 657A.10A to add to the
 20 11 listing of factors for the court to consider when determining
 20 12 whether property has been abandoned.
 20 13    Division VI allows the authority to enter into an agreement
 20 14 for a housing enterprise tax credit for certain housing
 20 15 businesses that had mailed applications to the authority prior
 20 16 to the July 1, 2014, repeal of the housing enterprise tax
 20 17 credit in Code section 15E.193B.
 20 18    The division states that the authority may enter into
 20 19 an agreement and issue housing enterprise tax credits to a
 20 20 housing business if the city or county mailed the application
 20 21 forms on or after June 1, 2014, and prior to July 1, 2014,
 20 22 but the applications were not received by the authority, the
 20 23 application forms submitted were approved by the necessary
 20 24 governing bodies and commissions, the authority determines
 20 25 the housing business would otherwise be eligible under the
 20 26 Code section that was repealed, and the city or county and the
 20 27 eligible housing business meet all other requirements of the
 20 28 housing enterprise tax credit program and of the agreement
 20 29 entered into with the economic development authority.
 20 30    The division takes effect upon enactment and applies
 20 31 retroactively to July 1, 2014.

 16 31 preparing a life cycle cost analysis for a public agency to
 16 32 use methodology established, by rule, by the state building
 16 33 code commissioner, rather than methods and analytical

 17  2    Division II of the bill amends language relating to wages
 17  3 paid to an intern under the science, technology, engineering,
 17  4 and mathematics internship program to specify that an Iowa

 17  7 offers financial assistance for a student at a small or
 17  8 medium sized Iowa firm that is an innovative business or for
 17  9 a science, technology, engineering, or mathematics student
 17 10 working with an Iowa employer, for every $2 earned by the
 17 11 student in wages, the employer's payment of $1 shall be
 17 12 matched by the authority with $1 on a reimbursement basis.
 17 13 The division requires the authority to administer the two
 17 14 components of the internship program in as similar a manner

 17 27 legal or administrative entity formed by a Code chapter 28F
 17 28 agreement entered into by one or more counties, one or more

 17 24 July 1, 2018, to an existing district's plan.  The division
 17 25 modifies the definition of "governmental entity" for purposes
 17 26 of a flood mitigation project to include a joint board or other
 17 27 legal or administrative entity formed by a Code chapter 28F
 17 28 agreement entered into by one or more counties, one or more

 18  3 revenue to a reinvestment district account shall be made
 18  4 prior to transfer of sales tax increment revenue to a flood
 18  5 mitigation project account. The division also provides that
 18  6 from the amounts transferred to reinvestment district accounts
 18  7 and flood mitigation project accounts the department of revenue
 18  8 shall retain the lesser of $25,000 or the actual cost of
 18  9 administering the specified transfers of sales tax increment
 18 10 revenue quarterly as a repayment receipt.  The bill provides

 18 13 applies retroactively to reinvestment districts designated
 18 14 under Code chapter 15J in existence on or after July 1, 2014,
 18 15 and flood mitigation project plan applications received before,

 18 17 of the division amending Code section 423.2, regarding the
 18 18 transfers of sales tax increment revenue to a reinvestment
 18 19 district and to a flood mitigation project account as well as
 18 20 the retention of repayment receipts, apply to transfers of
 18 21 sales tax revenues made on or after July 1, 2015.
 18 22    Division IV of the bill relates to enterprise zones.  The
 18 23 division allows a city or county and the economic development
 18 24 authority for compliance reasons to amend agreements made under
 18 25 the enterprise zone program as long as the amendments do not
 18 26 increase the amount of incentives awarded and the economic
 18 27 development authority board approves.
 18 28    Division V of the bill relates to nuisance properties
 18 29 and abandoned buildings. The division requires the economic
 18 30 development authority to establish a nuisance property
 18 31 remediation fund for the purpose of providing financial
 18 32 assistance to cities for the remediation of nuisance
 18 33 properties, abandoned buildings, and other structures.  The
 18 34 division provides that moneys in a fund established in the high
 18 35 quality jobs program may be deposited in the nuisance property
 19  1 remediation fund.  The division allows the authority to operate
 19  2 the fund as a revolving fund and to use moneys in the fund for
 19  3 purposes of the program, or the authority may transfer the
 19  4 moneys to other funds it has created.  However, the division
 19  5 states that the authority must use any money specifically
 19  6 appropriated for nuisance property remediation assistance for
 19  7 the program.  Moneys in the fund consist of appropriations and
 19  8 any other moneys lawfully available to the authority.  The
 19  9 authority may provide this assistance using a competitive
 19 10 scoring process.  The division requires the authority to enter
 19 11 into an agreement with the city concerning the assistance.  The
 19 12 division allows the authority to grant priority to cities with
 19 13 severe blighted areas, widespread dilapidated housing stock, or
 19 14 high rates of low and moderate income residents.
 19 15    Division V also makes changes to the authority of cities and
 19 16 counties relating to certain abandoned or unsafe buildings.
 19 17 Code chapter 657A allows a city or county to take action
 19 18 to abate by rehabilitation a building used primarily for
 19 19 residential purposes that meets the statutory definition of
 19 20 "abandoned" or "public nuisance", as those terms are defined
 19 21 by the Iowa Code.  The costs associated with rehabilitating
 19 22 the building that remain unpaid by the owner create a mortgage
 19 23 lien against the property.  In lieu of abatement through
 19 24 rehabilitation, Code section 657A.10A allows a city to file
 19 25 an action in district court to take title to an abandoned
 19 26 building.  The court may award title to the petitioning city if
 19 27 the court finds that the building is abandoned, using factors
 19 28 established in statute, or if the city establishes that all
 19 29 interested parties received proper notice and the interested
 19 30 parties either consented to the title transfer or had taken no
 19 31 action to comply with local housing official orders within 60
 19 32 days after the filing of the petition.
 19 33    The division amends the definition of "building" in Code
 19 34 section 657A.1 to include buildings used or intended to be used
 19 35 for commercial or industrial purposes and makes corresponding
 20  1 amendments to refer to the local building code or local housing
 20  2 code, as applicable.
 20  3    Currently, Code section 657A.10A requires that service
 20  4 of notice of the filing of the petition for title be made
 20  5 on interested parties by certified mail and by posting on
 20  6 the building.  The division provides that service shall be
 20  7 by personal service or certified mail or, if service cannot
 20  8 be made by either method, by posting on the building and
 20  9 publication in a newspaper of general circulation in the city.
 20 10    The division also amends Code section 657A.10A to add to the
 20 11 listing of factors for the court to consider when determining
 20 12 whether property has been abandoned.
 20 13    Division VI allows the authority to enter into an agreement
 20 14 for a housing enterprise tax credit for certain housing
 20 15 businesses that had mailed applications to the authority prior
 20 16 to the July 1, 2014, repeal of the housing enterprise tax
 20 17 credit in Code section 15E.193B.
 20 18    The division states that the authority may enter into
 20 19 an agreement and issue housing enterprise tax credits to a
 20 20 housing business if the city or county mailed the application
 20 21 forms on or after June 1, 2014, and prior to July 1, 2014,
 20 22 but the applications were not received by the authority, the
 20 23 application forms submitted were approved by the necessary
 20 24 governing bodies and commissions, the authority determines
 20 25 the housing business would otherwise be eligible under the

 19  7 the program.  Moneys in the fund consist of appropriations and
 19  8 any other moneys lawfully available to the authority.  The
 19  9 authority may provide this assistance using a competitive
 19 10 scoring process.  The division requires the authority to enter
 19 11 into an agreement with the city concerning the assistance.  The
 19 12 division allows the authority to grant priority to cities with
 19 13 severe blighted areas, widespread dilapidated housing stock, or
 19 14 high rates of low and moderate income residents.
 19 15    Division V also makes changes to the authority of cities and
 19 16 counties relating to certain abandoned or unsafe buildings.
 19 17 Code chapter 657A allows a city or county to take action
 19 18 to abate by rehabilitation a building used primarily for
 19 19 residential purposes that meets the statutory definition of
 19 20 "abandoned" or "public nuisance", as those terms are defined
 19 21 by the Iowa Code.  The costs associated with rehabilitating
 19 22 the building that remain unpaid by the owner create a mortgage
 19 23 lien against the property.  In lieu of abatement through
 19 24 rehabilitation, Code section 657A.10A allows a city to file
 19 25 an action in district court to take title to an abandoned
 19 26 building.  The court may award title to the petitioning city if
 19 27 the court finds that the building is abandoned, using factors
 19 28 established in statute, or if the city establishes that all
 19 29 interested parties received proper notice and the interested
 19 30 parties either consented to the title transfer or had taken no
 19 31 action to comply with local housing official orders within 60
 19 32 days after the filing of the petition.
 19 33    The division amends the definition of "building" in Code
 19 34 section 657A.1 to include buildings used or intended to be used
 19 35 for commercial or industrial purposes and makes corresponding
 20  1 amendments to refer to the local building code or local housing
 20  2 code, as applicable.
 20  3    Currently, Code section 657A.10A requires that service
 20  4 of notice of the filing of the petition for title be made
 20  5 on interested parties by certified mail and by posting on
 20  6 the building.  The division provides that service shall be
 20  7 by personal service or certified mail or, if service cannot
 20  8 be made by either method, by posting on the building and
 20  9 publication in a newspaper of general circulation in the city.
 20 10    The division also amends Code section 657A.10A to add to the

 20 15 businesses that had mailed applications to the authority prior
 20 16 to the July 1, 2014, repeal of the housing enterprise tax
 20 17 credit in Code section 15E.193B.
 20 18    The division states that the authority may enter into

 20 20 housing business if the city or county mailed the application
 20 21 forms on or after June 1, 2014, and prior to July 1, 2014,

 16 28 to include the performance of a life cycle cost analysis as
 16 29 a design criterion on or after the effective date of the
 16 30 division.  The division requires a public agency or person
 16 31 preparing a life cycle cost analysis for a public agency to
 16 32 use methodology established, by rule, by the state building
 16 33 code commissioner, rather than methods and analytical
 16 34 models provided by the economic development authority.  The
 16 35 division requires the commissioner to also adopt rules for the

 17  2    Division II of the bill amends language relating to wages
 17  3 paid to an intern under the science, technology, engineering,

 17  7 offers financial assistance for a student at a small or
 17  8 medium sized Iowa firm that is an innovative business or for
 17  9 a science, technology, engineering, or mathematics student
 17 10 working with an Iowa employer, for every $2 earned by the
 17 11 student in wages, the employer's payment of $1 shall be
 17 12 matched by the authority with $1 on a reimbursement basis.
 17 13 The division requires the authority to administer the two
 17 14 components of the internship program in as similar a manner

 17 22 Code chapter 418.  The division eliminates the prohibition on
 17 23 the flood mitigation board approving an amendment on or after
 17 24 July 1, 2018, to an existing district's plan.  The division
 17 25 modifies the definition of "governmental entity" for purposes
 17 26 of a flood mitigation project to include a joint board or other
 17 27 legal or administrative entity formed by a Code chapter 28F
 17 28 agreement entered into by one or more counties, one or more
 17 29 cities at least partly within the counties, and one or more
 17 30 Code chapter 358 sanitary districts or a combined water and
 17 31 sanitary district established by Code chapter 357 or 358 and
 17 32 located at least partly within the city or county.
 17 33    The division provides that, for purposes of funding a
 17 34 flood mitigation project, the sales tax increment area shall
 17 35 not include any parcels that are included in a reinvestment
 18  1 district established under Code chapter 15J.
 18  2    The division provides that transfers of sales tax increment
 18  3 revenue to a reinvestment district account shall be made
 18  4 prior to transfer of sales tax increment revenue to a flood
 18  5 mitigation project account. The division also provides that
 18  6 from the amounts transferred to reinvestment district accounts
 18  7 and flood mitigation project accounts the department of revenue
 18  8 shall retain the lesser of $25,000 or the actual cost of
 18  9 administering the specified transfers of sales tax increment
 18 10 revenue quarterly as a repayment receipt.  The bill provides
 18 11 the process for the retention of the revenue.
 18 12    The division is effective upon enactment.  The division
 18 13 applies retroactively to reinvestment districts designated
 18 14 under Code chapter 15J in existence on or after July 1, 2014,
 18 15 and flood mitigation project plan applications received before,

 18 17 of the division amending Code section 423.2, regarding the
 18 18 transfers of sales tax increment revenue to a reinvestment
 18 19 district and to a flood mitigation project account as well as
 18 20 the retention of repayment receipts, apply to transfers of

 18 23 division allows a city or county and the economic development
 18 24 authority for compliance reasons to amend agreements made under
 18 25 the enterprise zone program as long as the amendments do not
 18 26 increase the amount of incentives awarded and the economic
 18 27 development authority board approves.
 18 28    Division V of the bill relates to nuisance properties
 18 29 and abandoned buildings. The division requires the economic
 18 30 development authority to establish a nuisance property
 18 31 remediation fund for the purpose of providing financial
 18 32 assistance to cities for the remediation of nuisance
 18 33 properties, abandoned buildings, and other structures.  The
 18 34 division provides that moneys in a fund established in the high
 18 35 quality jobs program may be deposited in the nuisance property
 19  1 remediation fund.  The division allows the authority to operate
 19  2 the fund as a revolving fund and to use moneys in the fund for
 19  3 purposes of the program, or the authority may transfer the
 19  4 moneys to other funds it has created.  However, the division
 19  5 states that the authority must use any money specifically
 19  6 appropriated for nuisance property remediation assistance for
 19  7 the program.  Moneys in the fund consist of appropriations and
 19  8 any other moneys lawfully available to the authority.  The
 19  9 authority may provide this assistance using a competitive

 18  2    The division provides that transfers of sales tax increment
 18  3 revenue to a reinvestment district account shall be made
 18  4 prior to transfer of sales tax increment revenue to a flood
 18  5 mitigation project account. The division also provides that
 18  6 from the amounts transferred to reinvestment district accounts
 18  7 and flood mitigation project accounts the department of revenue
 18  8 shall retain the lesser of $25,000 or the actual cost of
 18  9 administering the specified transfers of sales tax increment
 18 10 revenue quarterly as a repayment receipt.  The bill provides
 18 11 the process for the retention of the revenue.
 18 12    The division is effective upon enactment.  The division
 18 13 applies retroactively to reinvestment districts designated
 18 14 under Code chapter 15J in existence on or after July 1, 2014,

 18 17 of the division amending Code section 423.2, regarding the
 18 18 transfers of sales tax increment revenue to a reinvestment
 18 19 district and to a flood mitigation project account as well as
 18 20 the retention of repayment receipts, apply to transfers of
 18 21 sales tax revenues made on or after July 1, 2015.
 18 22    Division IV of the bill relates to enterprise zones.  The
 18 23 division allows a city or county and the economic development
 18 24 authority for compliance reasons to amend agreements made under
 18 25 the enterprise zone program as long as the amendments do not
 18 26 increase the amount of incentives awarded and the economic
 18 27 development authority board approves.
 18 28    Division V of the bill relates to nuisance properties
 18 29 and abandoned buildings. The division requires the economic
 18 30 development authority to establish a nuisance property
 18 31 remediation fund for the purpose of providing financial
 18 32 assistance to cities for the remediation of nuisance
 18 33 properties, abandoned buildings, and other structures.  The
 18 34 division provides that moneys in a fund established in the high
 18 35 quality jobs program may be deposited in the nuisance property
 19  1 remediation fund.  The division allows the authority to operate
 19  2 the fund as a revolving fund and to use moneys in the fund for
 19  3 purposes of the program, or the authority may transfer the
 19  4 moneys to other funds it has created.  However, the division
 19  5 states that the authority must use any money specifically
 19  6 appropriated for nuisance property remediation assistance for
 19  7 the program.  Moneys in the fund consist of appropriations and
 19  8 any other moneys lawfully available to the authority.  The
 19  9 authority may provide this assistance using a competitive
 19 10 scoring process.  The division requires the authority to enter
 19 11 into an agreement with the city concerning the assistance.  The
 19 12 division allows the authority to grant priority to cities with
 19 13 severe blighted areas, widespread dilapidated housing stock, or
 19 14 high rates of low and moderate income residents.
 19 15    Division V also makes changes to the authority of cities and
 19 16 counties relating to certain abandoned or unsafe buildings.
 19 17 Code chapter 657A allows a city or county to take action
 19 18 to abate by rehabilitation a building used primarily for
 19 19 residential purposes that meets the statutory definition of
 19 20 "abandoned" or "public nuisance", as those terms are defined
 19 21 by the Iowa Code.  The costs associated with rehabilitating
 19 22 the building that remain unpaid by the owner create a mortgage
 19 23 lien against the property.  In lieu of abatement through
 19 24 rehabilitation, Code section 657A.10A allows a city to file
 19 25 an action in district court to take title to an abandoned
 19 26 building.  The court may award title to the petitioning city if
 19 27 the court finds that the building is abandoned, using factors
 19 28 established in statute, or if the city establishes that all
 19 29 interested parties received proper notice and the interested
 19 30 parties either consented to the title transfer or had taken no
 19 31 action to comply with local housing official orders within 60
 19 32 days after the filing of the petition.
 19 33    The division amends the definition of "building" in Code
 19 34 section 657A.1 to include buildings used or intended to be used
 19 35 for commercial or industrial purposes and makes corresponding
 20  1 amendments to refer to the local building code or local housing
 20  2 code, as applicable.
 20  3    Currently, Code section 657A.10A requires that service
 20  4 of notice of the filing of the petition for title be made
 20  5 on interested parties by certified mail and by posting on
 20  6 the building.  The division provides that service shall be
 20  7 by personal service or certified mail or, if service cannot
 20  8 be made by either method, by posting on the building and
 20  9 publication in a newspaper of general circulation in the city.
 20 10    The division also amends Code section 657A.10A to add to the
 20 11 listing of factors for the court to consider when determining
 20 12 whether property has been abandoned.
 20 13    Division VI allows the authority to enter into an agreement
 20 14 for a housing enterprise tax credit for certain housing
 20 15 businesses that had mailed applications to the authority prior
 20 16 to the July 1, 2014, repeal of the housing enterprise tax
 20 17 credit in Code section 15E.193B.
 20 18    The division states that the authority may enter into
 20 19 an agreement and issue housing enterprise tax credits to a
 20 20 housing business if the city or county mailed the application
 20 21 forms on or after June 1, 2014, and prior to July 1, 2014,
 20 22 but the applications were not received by the authority, the
 20 23 application forms submitted were approved by the necessary
 20 24 governing bodies and commissions, the authority determines
 20 25 the housing business would otherwise be eligible under the
 20 26 Code section that was repealed, and the city or county and the
 20 27 eligible housing business meet all other requirements of the
 20 28 housing enterprise tax credit program and of the agreement
 20 29 entered into with the economic development authority.

 16 27 of a facility or the construction of an addition to a facility
 16 28 to include the performance of a life cycle cost analysis as
 16 29 a design criterion on or after the effective date of the

 16 31 preparing a life cycle cost analysis for a public agency to
 16 32 use methodology established, by rule, by the state building
 16 33 code commissioner, rather than methods and analytical
 16 34 models provided by the economic development authority.  The
 16 35 division requires the commissioner to also adopt rules for the
 17  1 implementation and adoption of the life cycle cost analysis.
 17  2    Division II of the bill amends language relating to wages
 17  3 paid to an intern under the science, technology, engineering,
 17  4 and mathematics internship program to specify that an Iowa
 17  5 employer may receive financial assistance from the state on a
 17  6 matching basis.  The division provides that if the authority
 17  7 offers financial assistance for a student at a small or
 17  8 medium sized Iowa firm that is an innovative business or for
 17  9 a science, technology, engineering, or mathematics student
 17 10 working with an Iowa employer, for every $2 earned by the
 17 11 student in wages, the employer's payment of $1 shall be
 17 12 matched by the authority with $1 on a reimbursement basis.
 17 13 The division requires the authority to administer the two
 17 14 components of the internship program in as similar a manner
 17 15 as possible. The division authorizes the authority to adopt
 17 16 emergency rules for this division of the bill.  The division
 17 17 takes effect upon enactment and applies retroactively to
 17 18 contracts for financial assistance entered into on or after

 17 22 Code chapter 418.  The division eliminates the prohibition on
 17 23 the flood mitigation board approving an amendment on or after
 17 24 July 1, 2018, to an existing district's plan.  The division
 17 25 modifies the definition of "governmental entity" for purposes
 17 26 of a flood mitigation project to include a joint board or other
 17 27 legal or administrative entity formed by a Code chapter 28F
 17 28 agreement entered into by one or more counties, one or more
 17 29 cities at least partly within the counties, and one or more

 16 35 division requires the commissioner to also adopt rules for the
 17  1 implementation and adoption of the life cycle cost analysis.
 17  2    Division II of the bill amends language relating to wages
 17  3 paid to an intern under the science, technology, engineering,
 17  4 and mathematics internship program to specify that an Iowa
 17  5 employer may receive financial assistance from the state on a
 17  6 matching basis.  The division provides that if the authority
 17  7 offers financial assistance for a student at a small or
 17  8 medium sized Iowa firm that is an innovative business or for
 17  9 a science, technology, engineering, or mathematics student
 17 10 working with an Iowa employer, for every $2 earned by the
 17 11 student in wages, the employer's payment of $1 shall be
 17 12 matched by the authority with $1 on a reimbursement basis.
 17 13 The division requires the authority to administer the two
 17 14 components of the internship program in as similar a manner
 17 15 as possible. The division authorizes the authority to adopt
 17 16 emergency rules for this division of the bill.  The division
 17 17 takes effect upon enactment and applies retroactively to
 17 18 contracts for financial assistance entered into on or after
 17 19 July 1, 2014.
 17 20    Division III of the bill relates to reinvestment districts
 17 21 under Code chapter 15J and flood mitigation projects under
 17 22 Code chapter 418.  The division eliminates the prohibition on
 17 23 the flood mitigation board approving an amendment on or after
 17 24 July 1, 2018, to an existing district's plan.  The division
 17 25 modifies the definition of "governmental entity" for purposes
 17 26 of a flood mitigation project to include a joint board or other
 17 27 legal or administrative entity formed by a Code chapter 28F
 17 28 agreement entered into by one or more counties, one or more
 17 29 cities at least partly within the counties, and one or more
 17 30 Code chapter 358 sanitary districts or a combined water and
 17 31 sanitary district established by Code chapter 357 or 358 and
 17 32 located at least partly within the city or county.
 17 33    The division provides that, for purposes of funding a
 17 34 flood mitigation project, the sales tax increment area shall
 17 35 not include any parcels that are included in a reinvestment
 18  1 district established under Code chapter 15J.
 18  2    The division provides that transfers of sales tax increment
 18  3 revenue to a reinvestment district account shall be made
 18  4 prior to transfer of sales tax increment revenue to a flood
 18  5 mitigation project account. The division also provides that
 18  6 from the amounts transferred to reinvestment district accounts
 18  7 and flood mitigation project accounts the department of revenue
 18  8 shall retain the lesser of $25,000 or the actual cost of
 18  9 administering the specified transfers of sales tax increment
 18 10 revenue quarterly as a repayment receipt.  The bill provides
 18 11 the process for the retention of the revenue.
 18 12    The division is effective upon enactment.  The division
 18 13 applies retroactively to reinvestment districts designated
 18 14 under Code chapter 15J in existence on or after July 1, 2014,
 18 15 and flood mitigation project plan applications received before,
 18 16 on, or after the effective date of the division.  The sections
 18 17 of the division amending Code section 423.2, regarding the
 18 18 transfers of sales tax increment revenue to a reinvestment
 18 19 district and to a flood mitigation project account as well as
 18 20 the retention of repayment receipts, apply to transfers of
 18 21 sales tax revenues made on or after July 1, 2015.
 18 22    Division IV of the bill relates to enterprise zones.  The
 18 23 division allows a city or county and the economic development
 18 24 authority for compliance reasons to amend agreements made under
 18 25 the enterprise zone program as long as the amendments do not
 18 26 increase the amount of incentives awarded and the economic
 18 27 development authority board approves.
 18 28    Division V of the bill relates to nuisance properties
 18 29 and abandoned buildings. The division requires the economic
 18 30 development authority to establish a nuisance property
 18 31 remediation fund for the purpose of providing financial
 18 32 assistance to cities for the remediation of nuisance
 18 33 properties, abandoned buildings, and other structures.  The
 18 34 division provides that moneys in a fund established in the high
 18 35 quality jobs program may be deposited in the nuisance property
 19  1 remediation fund.  The division allows the authority to operate
 19  2 the fund as a revolving fund and to use moneys in the fund for
 19  3 purposes of the program, or the authority may transfer the
 19  4 moneys to other funds it has created.  However, the division
 19  5 states that the authority must use any money specifically
 19  6 appropriated for nuisance property remediation assistance for
 19  7 the program.  Moneys in the fund consist of appropriations and
 19  8 any other moneys lawfully available to the authority.  The
 19  9 authority may provide this assistance using a competitive
 19 10 scoring process.  The division requires the authority to enter
 19 11 into an agreement with the city concerning the assistance.  The
 19 12 division allows the authority to grant priority to cities with
 19 13 severe blighted areas, widespread dilapidated housing stock, or
 19 14 high rates of low and moderate income residents.
 19 15    Division V also makes changes to the authority of cities and
 19 16 counties relating to certain abandoned or unsafe buildings.
 19 17 Code chapter 657A allows a city or county to take action
 19 18 to abate by rehabilitation a building used primarily for
 19 19 residential purposes that meets the statutory definition of
 19 20 "abandoned" or "public nuisance", as those terms are defined
 19 21 by the Iowa Code.  The costs associated with rehabilitating
 19 22 the building that remain unpaid by the owner create a mortgage
 19 23 lien against the property.  In lieu of abatement through
 19 24 rehabilitation, Code section 657A.10A allows a city to file
 19 25 an action in district court to take title to an abandoned
 19 26 building.  The court may award title to the petitioning city if
 19 27 the court finds that the building is abandoned, using factors
 19 28 established in statute, or if the city establishes that all
 19 29 interested parties received proper notice and the interested
 19 30 parties either consented to the title transfer or had taken no
 19 31 action to comply with local housing official orders within 60
 19 32 days after the filing of the petition.
 19 33    The division amends the definition of "building" in Code
 19 34 section 657A.1 to include buildings used or intended to be used
 19 35 for commercial or industrial purposes and makes corresponding
 20  1 amendments to refer to the local building code or local housing
 20  2 code, as applicable.
 20  3    Currently, Code section 657A.10A requires that service
 20  4 of notice of the filing of the petition for title be made
 20  5 on interested parties by certified mail and by posting on
 20  6 the building.  The division provides that service shall be
 20  7 by personal service or certified mail or, if service cannot
 20  8 be made by either method, by posting on the building and
 20  9 publication in a newspaper of general circulation in the city.
 20 10    The division also amends Code section 657A.10A to add to the
 20 11 listing of factors for the court to consider when determining
 20 12 whether property has been abandoned.
 20 13    Division VI allows the authority to enter into an agreement
 20 14 for a housing enterprise tax credit for certain housing
 20 15 businesses that had mailed applications to the authority prior
 20 16 to the July 1, 2014, repeal of the housing enterprise tax
 20 17 credit in Code section 15E.193B.
 20 18    The division states that the authority may enter into
 20 19 an agreement and issue housing enterprise tax credits to a
 20 20 housing business if the city or county mailed the application
 20 21 forms on or after June 1, 2014, and prior to July 1, 2014,
 20 22 but the applications were not received by the authority, the
 20 23 application forms submitted were approved by the necessary
 20 24 governing bodies and commissions, the authority determines
 20 25 the housing business would otherwise be eligible under the
 20 26 Code section that was repealed, and the city or county and the
 20 27 eligible housing business meet all other requirements of the
 20 28 housing enterprise tax credit program and of the agreement
 20 29 entered into with the economic development authority.
 20 30    The division takes effect upon enactment and applies
 20 31 retroactively to July 1, 2014.

 16 23 life cycle analysis required of certain public facilities.
 16 24 The division adds a definition of "addition" and modifies the
 16 25 definitions of "facility" and "renovation" and requires a
 16 26 public agency responsible for the construction or renovation
 16 27 of a facility or the construction of an addition to a facility
 16 28 to include the performance of a life cycle cost analysis as
 16 29 a design criterion on or after the effective date of the
 16 30 division.  The division requires a public agency or person
 16 31 preparing a life cycle cost analysis for a public agency to
 16 32 use methodology established, by rule, by the state building
 16 33 code commissioner, rather than methods and analytical
 16 34 models provided by the economic development authority.  The

 17 26 of a flood mitigation project to include a joint board or other
 17 27 legal or administrative entity formed by a Code chapter 28F
 17 28 agreement entered into by one or more counties, one or more

 18 10 revenue quarterly as a repayment receipt.  The bill provides
 18 11 the process for the retention of the revenue.

 20 17 credit in Code section 15E.193B.
 20 18    The division states that the authority may enter into
 20 19 an agreement and issue housing enterprise tax credits to a
 20 20 housing business if the city or county mailed the application
 20 21 forms on or after June 1, 2014, and prior to July 1, 2014,
 20 22 but the applications were not received by the authority, the
 20 23 application forms submitted were approved by the necessary
 20 24 governing bodies and commissions, the authority determines
 20 25 the housing business would otherwise be eligible under the
 20 26 Code section that was repealed, and the city or county and the
 20 27 eligible housing business meet all other requirements of the
 20 28 housing enterprise tax credit program and of the agreement
 20 29 entered into with the economic development authority.

 16 28 to include the performance of a life cycle cost analysis as
 16 29 a design criterion on or after the effective date of the
 16 30 division.  The division requires a public agency or person
 16 31 preparing a life cycle cost analysis for a public agency to
 16 32 use methodology established, by rule, by the state building
 16 33 code commissioner, rather than methods and analytical
 16 34 models provided by the economic development authority.  The
 16 35 division requires the commissioner to also adopt rules for the
 17  1 implementation and adoption of the life cycle cost analysis.
 17  2    Division II of the bill amends language relating to wages
 17  3 paid to an intern under the science, technology, engineering,
 17  4 and mathematics internship program to specify that an Iowa
 17  5 employer may receive financial assistance from the state on a

 17  7 offers financial assistance for a student at a small or
 17  8 medium sized Iowa firm that is an innovative business or for
 17  9 a science, technology, engineering, or mathematics student
 17 10 working with an Iowa employer, for every $2 earned by the
 17 11 student in wages, the employer's payment of $1 shall be
 17 12 matched by the authority with $1 on a reimbursement basis.
 17 13 The division requires the authority to administer the two
 17 14 components of the internship program in as similar a manner
 17 15 as possible. The division authorizes the authority to adopt
 17 16 emergency rules for this division of the bill.  The division
 17 17 takes effect upon enactment and applies retroactively to
 17 18 contracts for financial assistance entered into on or after
 17 19 July 1, 2014.
 17 20    Division III of the bill relates to reinvestment districts
 17 21 under Code chapter 15J and flood mitigation projects under
 17 22 Code chapter 418.  The division eliminates the prohibition on
 17 23 the flood mitigation board approving an amendment on or after
 17 24 July 1, 2018, to an existing district's plan.  The division
 17 25 modifies the definition of "governmental entity" for purposes
 17 26 of a flood mitigation project to include a joint board or other
 17 27 legal or administrative entity formed by a Code chapter 28F
 17 28 agreement entered into by one or more counties, one or more
 17 29 cities at least partly within the counties, and one or more
 17 30 Code chapter 358 sanitary districts or a combined water and
 17 31 sanitary district established by Code chapter 357 or 358 and
 17 32 located at least partly within the city or county.
 17 33    The division provides that, for purposes of funding a
 17 34 flood mitigation project, the sales tax increment area shall
 17 35 not include any parcels that are included in a reinvestment
 18  1 district established under Code chapter 15J.
 18  2    The division provides that transfers of sales tax increment
 18  3 revenue to a reinvestment district account shall be made
 18  4 prior to transfer of sales tax increment revenue to a flood
 18  5 mitigation project account. The division also provides that
 18  6 from the amounts transferred to reinvestment district accounts
 18  7 and flood mitigation project accounts the department of revenue
 18  8 shall retain the lesser of $25,000 or the actual cost of
 18  9 administering the specified transfers of sales tax increment
 18 10 revenue quarterly as a repayment receipt.  The bill provides
 18 11 the process for the retention of the revenue.
 18 12    The division is effective upon enactment.  The division
 18 13 applies retroactively to reinvestment districts designated
 18 14 under Code chapter 15J in existence on or after July 1, 2014,
 18 15 and flood mitigation project plan applications received before,
 18 16 on, or after the effective date of the division.  The sections
 18 17 of the division amending Code section 423.2, regarding the
 18 18 transfers of sales tax increment revenue to a reinvestment
 18 19 district and to a flood mitigation project account as well as
 18 20 the retention of repayment receipts, apply to transfers of
 18 21 sales tax revenues made on or after July 1, 2015.
 18 22    Division IV of the bill relates to enterprise zones.  The
 18 23 division allows a city or county and the economic development
 18 24 authority for compliance reasons to amend agreements made under
 18 25 the enterprise zone program as long as the amendments do not
 18 26 increase the amount of incentives awarded and the economic
 18 27 development authority board approves.
 18 28    Division V of the bill relates to nuisance properties
 18 29 and abandoned buildings. The division requires the economic
 18 30 development authority to establish a nuisance property
 18 31 remediation fund for the purpose of providing financial
 18 32 assistance to cities for the remediation of nuisance
 18 33 properties, abandoned buildings, and other structures.  The
 18 34 division provides that moneys in a fund established in the high
 18 35 quality jobs program may be deposited in the nuisance property
 19  1 remediation fund.  The division allows the authority to operate
 19  2 the fund as a revolving fund and to use moneys in the fund for
 19  3 purposes of the program, or the authority may transfer the
 19  4 moneys to other funds it has created.  However, the division
 19  5 states that the authority must use any money specifically
 19  6 appropriated for nuisance property remediation assistance for
 19  7 the program.  Moneys in the fund consist of appropriations and
 19  8 any other moneys lawfully available to the authority.  The
 19  9 authority may provide this assistance using a competitive
 19 10 scoring process.  The division requires the authority to enter
 19 11 into an agreement with the city concerning the assistance.  The
 19 12 division allows the authority to grant priority to cities with
 19 13 severe blighted areas, widespread dilapidated housing stock, or
 19 14 high rates of low and moderate income residents.
 19 15    Division V also makes changes to the authority of cities and
 19 16 counties relating to certain abandoned or unsafe buildings.
 19 17 Code chapter 657A allows a city or county to take action
 19 18 to abate by rehabilitation a building used primarily for
 19 19 residential purposes that meets the statutory definition of
 19 20 "abandoned" or "public nuisance", as those terms are defined
 19 21 by the Iowa Code.  The costs associated with rehabilitating
 19 22 the building that remain unpaid by the owner create a mortgage
 19 23 lien against the property.  In lieu of abatement through
 19 24 rehabilitation, Code section 657A.10A allows a city to file
 19 25 an action in district court to take title to an abandoned
 19 26 building.  The court may award title to the petitioning city if
 19 27 the court finds that the building is abandoned, using factors
 19 28 established in statute, or if the city establishes that all
 19 29 interested parties received proper notice and the interested
 19 30 parties either consented to the title transfer or had taken no
 19 31 action to comply with local housing official orders within 60
 19 32 days after the filing of the petition.
 19 33    The division amends the definition of "building" in Code
 19 34 section 657A.1 to include buildings used or intended to be used
 19 35 for commercial or industrial purposes and makes corresponding
 20  1 amendments to refer to the local building code or local housing
 20  2 code, as applicable.
 20  3    Currently, Code section 657A.10A requires that service
 20  4 of notice of the filing of the petition for title be made
 20  5 on interested parties by certified mail and by posting on
 20  6 the building.  The division provides that service shall be
 20  7 by personal service or certified mail or, if service cannot
 20  8 be made by either method, by posting on the building and
 20  9 publication in a newspaper of general circulation in the city.
 20 10    The division also amends Code section 657A.10A to add to the
 20 11 listing of factors for the court to consider when determining
 20 12 whether property has been abandoned.
 20 13    Division VI allows the authority to enter into an agreement
 20 14 for a housing enterprise tax credit for certain housing
 20 15 businesses that had mailed applications to the authority prior
 20 16 to the July 1, 2014, repeal of the housing enterprise tax
 20 17 credit in Code section 15E.193B.
 20 18    The division states that the authority may enter into
 20 19 an agreement and issue housing enterprise tax credits to a

 19 34 section 657A.1 to include buildings used or intended to be used
 19 35 for commercial or industrial purposes and makes corresponding
 20  1 amendments to refer to the local building code or local housing
 20  2 code, as applicable.
 20  3    Currently, Code section 657A.10A requires that service
 20  4 of notice of the filing of the petition for title be made
 20  5 on interested parties by certified mail and by posting on
 20  6 the building.  The division provides that service shall be
 20  7 by personal service or certified mail or, if service cannot
 20  8 be made by either method, by posting on the building and
 20  9 publication in a newspaper of general circulation in the city.

 20 15 businesses that had mailed applications to the authority prior
 20 16 to the July 1, 2014, repeal of the housing enterprise tax
 20 17 credit in Code section 15E.193B.
 20 18    The division states that the authority may enter into
 20 19 an agreement and issue housing enterprise tax credits to a
 20 20 housing business if the city or county mailed the application
 20 21 forms on or after June 1, 2014, and prior to July 1, 2014,
 20 22 but the applications were not received by the authority, the
 20 23 application forms submitted were approved by the necessary
 20 24 governing bodies and commissions, the authority determines
 20 25 the housing business would otherwise be eligible under the
 20 26 Code section that was repealed, and the city or county and the
 20 27 eligible housing business meet all other requirements of the
 20 28 housing enterprise tax credit program and of the agreement
 20 29 entered into with the economic development authority.

 16 28 to include the performance of a life cycle cost analysis as
 16 29 a design criterion on or after the effective date of the
 16 30 division.  The division requires a public agency or person
 16 31 preparing a life cycle cost analysis for a public agency to
 16 32 use methodology established, by rule, by the state building
 16 33 code commissioner, rather than methods and analytical
 16 34 models provided by the economic development authority.  The

 17  1 implementation and adoption of the life cycle cost analysis.
 17  2    Division II of the bill amends language relating to wages
 17  3 paid to an intern under the science, technology, engineering,
 17  4 and mathematics internship program to specify that an Iowa
 17  5 employer may receive financial assistance from the state on a

 17  7 offers financial assistance for a student at a small or
 17  8 medium sized Iowa firm that is an innovative business or for
 17  9 a science, technology, engineering, or mathematics student
 17 10 working with an Iowa employer, for every $2 earned by the
 17 11 student in wages, the employer's payment of $1 shall be
 17 12 matched by the authority with $1 on a reimbursement basis.
 17 13 The division requires the authority to administer the two
 17 14 components of the internship program in as similar a manner
 17 15 as possible. The division authorizes the authority to adopt
 17 16 emergency rules for this division of the bill.  The division
 17 17 takes effect upon enactment and applies retroactively to
 17 18 contracts for financial assistance entered into on or after
 17 19 July 1, 2014.
 17 20    Division III of the bill relates to reinvestment districts

 17 22 Code chapter 418.  The division eliminates the prohibition on
 17 23 the flood mitigation board approving an amendment on or after
 17 24 July 1, 2018, to an existing district's plan.  The division
 17 25 modifies the definition of "governmental entity" for purposes
 17 26 of a flood mitigation project to include a joint board or other
 17 27 legal or administrative entity formed by a Code chapter 28F
 17 28 agreement entered into by one or more counties, one or more
 17 29 cities at least partly within the counties, and one or more
 17 30 Code chapter 358 sanitary districts or a combined water and
 17 31 sanitary district established by Code chapter 357 or 358 and
 17 32 located at least partly within the city or county.
 17 33    The division provides that, for purposes of funding a

 18  2    The division provides that transfers of sales tax increment
 18  3 revenue to a reinvestment district account shall be made
 18  4 prior to transfer of sales tax increment revenue to a flood
 18  5 mitigation project account. The division also provides that
 18  6 from the amounts transferred to reinvestment district accounts
 18  7 and flood mitigation project accounts the department of revenue
 18  8 shall retain the lesser of $25,000 or the actual cost of
 18  9 administering the specified transfers of sales tax increment
 18 10 revenue quarterly as a repayment receipt.  The bill provides
 18 11 the process for the retention of the revenue.
 18 12    The division is effective upon enactment.  The division
 18 13 applies retroactively to reinvestment districts designated
 18 14 under Code chapter 15J in existence on or after July 1, 2014,
 18 15 and flood mitigation project plan applications received before,
 18 16 on, or after the effective date of the division.  The sections
 18 17 of the division amending Code section 423.2, regarding the
 18 18 transfers of sales tax increment revenue to a reinvestment
 18 19 district and to a flood mitigation project account as well as
 18 20 the retention of repayment receipts, apply to transfers of
 18 21 sales tax revenues made on or after July 1, 2015.
 18 22    Division IV of the bill relates to enterprise zones.  The
 18 23 division allows a city or county and the economic development
 18 24 authority for compliance reasons to amend agreements made under
 18 25 the enterprise zone program as long as the amendments do not
 18 26 increase the amount of incentives awarded and the economic
 18 27 development authority board approves.
 18 28    Division V of the bill relates to nuisance properties
 18 29 and abandoned buildings. The division requires the economic
 18 30 development authority to establish a nuisance property
 18 31 remediation fund for the purpose of providing financial
 18 32 assistance to cities for the remediation of nuisance
 18 33 properties, abandoned buildings, and other structures.  The
 18 34 division provides that moneys in a fund established in the high
 18 35 quality jobs program may be deposited in the nuisance property
 19  1 remediation fund.  The division allows the authority to operate
 19  2 the fund as a revolving fund and to use moneys in the fund for
 19  3 purposes of the program, or the authority may transfer the
 19  4 moneys to other funds it has created.  However, the division
 19  5 states that the authority must use any money specifically
 19  6 appropriated for nuisance property remediation assistance for
 19  7 the program.  Moneys in the fund consist of appropriations and
 19  8 any other moneys lawfully available to the authority.  The
 19  9 authority may provide this assistance using a competitive
 19 10 scoring process.  The division requires the authority to enter
 19 11 into an agreement with the city concerning the assistance.  The
 19 12 division allows the authority to grant priority to cities with
 19 13 severe blighted areas, widespread dilapidated housing stock, or
 19 14 high rates of low and moderate income residents.
 19 15    Division V also makes changes to the authority of cities and
 19 16 counties relating to certain abandoned or unsafe buildings.
 19 17 Code chapter 657A allows a city or county to take action
 19 18 to abate by rehabilitation a building used primarily for
 19 19 residential purposes that meets the statutory definition of
 19 20 "abandoned" or "public nuisance", as those terms are defined
 19 21 by the Iowa Code.  The costs associated with rehabilitating
 19 22 the building that remain unpaid by the owner create a mortgage
 19 23 lien against the property.  In lieu of abatement through
 19 24 rehabilitation, Code section 657A.10A allows a city to file
 19 25 an action in district court to take title to an abandoned
 19 26 building.  The court may award title to the petitioning city if
 19 27 the court finds that the building is abandoned, using factors
 19 28 established in statute, or if the city establishes that all
 19 29 interested parties received proper notice and the interested
 19 30 parties either consented to the title transfer or had taken no
 19 31 action to comply with local housing official orders within 60
 19 32 days after the filing of the petition.
 19 33    The division amends the definition of "building" in Code
 19 34 section 657A.1 to include buildings used or intended to be used

 19 21 by the Iowa Code.  The costs associated with rehabilitating
 19 22 the building that remain unpaid by the owner create a mortgage
 19 23 lien against the property.  In lieu of abatement through
 19 24 rehabilitation, Code section 657A.10A allows a city to file
 19 25 an action in district court to take title to an abandoned
 19 26 building.  The court may award title to the petitioning city if
 19 27 the court finds that the building is abandoned, using factors
 19 28 established in statute, or if the city establishes that all
 19 29 interested parties received proper notice and the interested
 19 30 parties either consented to the title transfer or had taken no
 19 31 action to comply with local housing official orders within 60
 19 32 days after the filing of the petition.
 19 33    The division amends the definition of "building" in Code
 19 34 section 657A.1 to include buildings used or intended to be used
 19 35 for commercial or industrial purposes and makes corresponding
 20  1 amendments to refer to the local building code or local housing
 20  2 code, as applicable.
 20  3    Currently, Code section 657A.10A requires that service
 20  4 of notice of the filing of the petition for title be made
 20  5 on interested parties by certified mail and by posting on
 20  6 the building.  The division provides that service shall be
 20  7 by personal service or certified mail or, if service cannot
 20  8 be made by either method, by posting on the building and
 20  9 publication in a newspaper of general circulation in the city.
 20 10    The division also amends Code section 657A.10A to add to the
 20 11 listing of factors for the court to consider when determining
 20 12 whether property has been abandoned.
 20 13    Division VI allows the authority to enter into an agreement
 20 14 for a housing enterprise tax credit for certain housing
 20 15 businesses that had mailed applications to the authority prior
 20 16 to the July 1, 2014, repeal of the housing enterprise tax
 20 17 credit in Code section 15E.193B.
 20 18    The division states that the authority may enter into
 20 19 an agreement and issue housing enterprise tax credits to a
 20 20 housing business if the city or county mailed the application
 20 21 forms on or after June 1, 2014, and prior to July 1, 2014,
 20 22 but the applications were not received by the authority, the
 20 23 application forms submitted were approved by the necessary
 20 24 governing bodies and commissions, the authority determines
 20 25 the housing business would otherwise be eligible under the
 20 26 Code section that was repealed, and the city or county and the
 20 27 eligible housing business meet all other requirements of the
 20 28 housing enterprise tax credit program and of the agreement
 20 29 entered into with the economic development authority.

 16 35 division requires the commissioner to also adopt rules for the
 17  1 implementation and adoption of the life cycle cost analysis.
 17  2    Division II of the bill amends language relating to wages
 17  3 paid to an intern under the science, technology, engineering,

 17  5 employer may receive financial assistance from the state on a
 17  6 matching basis.  The division provides that if the authority
 17  7 offers financial assistance for a student at a small or
 17  8 medium sized Iowa firm that is an innovative business or for
 17  9 a science, technology, engineering, or mathematics student
 17 10 working with an Iowa employer, for every $2 earned by the
 17 11 student in wages, the employer's payment of $1 shall be
 17 12 matched by the authority with $1 on a reimbursement basis.
 17 13 The division requires the authority to administer the two
 17 14 components of the internship program in as similar a manner
 17 15 as possible. The division authorizes the authority to adopt

 17 22 Code chapter 418.  The division eliminates the prohibition on
 17 23 the flood mitigation board approving an amendment on or after
 17 24 July 1, 2018, to an existing district's plan.  The division
 17 25 modifies the definition of "governmental entity" for purposes
 17 26 of a flood mitigation project to include a joint board or other
 17 27 legal or administrative entity formed by a Code chapter 28F
 17 28 agreement entered into by one or more counties, one or more
 17 29 cities at least partly within the counties, and one or more
 17 30 Code chapter 358 sanitary districts or a combined water and
 17 31 sanitary district established by Code chapter 357 or 358 and

 17 33    The division provides that, for purposes of funding a
 17 34 flood mitigation project, the sales tax increment area shall
 17 35 not include any parcels that are included in a reinvestment
 18  1 district established under Code chapter 15J.
 18  2    The division provides that transfers of sales tax increment
 18  3 revenue to a reinvestment district account shall be made
 18  4 prior to transfer of sales tax increment revenue to a flood
 18  5 mitigation project account. The division also provides that
 18  6 from the amounts transferred to reinvestment district accounts
 18  7 and flood mitigation project accounts the department of revenue
 18  8 shall retain the lesser of $25,000 or the actual cost of
 18  9 administering the specified transfers of sales tax increment
 18 10 revenue quarterly as a repayment receipt.  The bill provides
 18 11 the process for the retention of the revenue.
 18 12    The division is effective upon enactment.  The division
 18 13 applies retroactively to reinvestment districts designated
 18 14 under Code chapter 15J in existence on or after July 1, 2014,
 18 15 and flood mitigation project plan applications received before,
 18 16 on, or after the effective date of the division.  The sections
 18 17 of the division amending Code section 423.2, regarding the
 18 18 transfers of sales tax increment revenue to a reinvestment
 18 19 district and to a flood mitigation project account as well as
 18 20 the retention of repayment receipts, apply to transfers of
 18 21 sales tax revenues made on or after July 1, 2015.
 18 22    Division IV of the bill relates to enterprise zones.  The
 18 23 division allows a city or county and the economic development
 18 24 authority for compliance reasons to amend agreements made under
 18 25 the enterprise zone program as long as the amendments do not
 18 26 increase the amount of incentives awarded and the economic
 18 27 development authority board approves.
 18 28    Division V of the bill relates to nuisance properties
 18 29 and abandoned buildings. The division requires the economic
 18 30 development authority to establish a nuisance property
 18 31 remediation fund for the purpose of providing financial
 18 32 assistance to cities for the remediation of nuisance
 18 33 properties, abandoned buildings, and other structures.  The
 18 34 division provides that moneys in a fund established in the high
 18 35 quality jobs program may be deposited in the nuisance property
 19  1 remediation fund.  The division allows the authority to operate
 19  2 the fund as a revolving fund and to use moneys in the fund for
 19  3 purposes of the program, or the authority may transfer the
 19  4 moneys to other funds it has created.  However, the division
 19  5 states that the authority must use any money specifically
 19  6 appropriated for nuisance property remediation assistance for
 19  7 the program.  Moneys in the fund consist of appropriations and
 19  8 any other moneys lawfully available to the authority.  The
 19  9 authority may provide this assistance using a competitive
 19 10 scoring process.  The division requires the authority to enter
 19 11 into an agreement with the city concerning the assistance.  The
 19 12 division allows the authority to grant priority to cities with
 19 13 severe blighted areas, widespread dilapidated housing stock, or
 19 14 high rates of low and moderate income residents.
 19 15    Division V also makes changes to the authority of cities and
 19 16 counties relating to certain abandoned or unsafe buildings.
 19 17 Code chapter 657A allows a city or county to take action

 19 19 residential purposes that meets the statutory definition of
 19 20 "abandoned" or "public nuisance", as those terms are defined
 19 21 by the Iowa Code.  The costs associated with rehabilitating
 19 22 the building that remain unpaid by the owner create a mortgage
 19 23 lien against the property.  In lieu of abatement through
 19 24 rehabilitation, Code section 657A.10A allows a city to file
 19 25 an action in district court to take title to an abandoned
 19 26 building.  The court may award title to the petitioning city if
 19 27 the court finds that the building is abandoned, using factors
 19 28 established in statute, or if the city establishes that all
 19 29 interested parties received proper notice and the interested
 19 30 parties either consented to the title transfer or had taken no
 19 31 action to comply with local housing official orders within 60
 19 32 days after the filing of the petition.

 19 18 to abate by rehabilitation a building used primarily for
 19 19 residential purposes that meets the statutory definition of
 19 20 "abandoned" or "public nuisance", as those terms are defined
 19 21 by the Iowa Code.  The costs associated with rehabilitating
 19 22 the building that remain unpaid by the owner create a mortgage
 19 23 lien against the property.  In lieu of abatement through
 19 24 rehabilitation, Code section 657A.10A allows a city to file
 19 25 an action in district court to take title to an abandoned
 19 26 building.  The court may award title to the petitioning city if
 19 27 the court finds that the building is abandoned, using factors
 19 28 established in statute, or if the city establishes that all
 19 29 interested parties received proper notice and the interested
 19 30 parties either consented to the title transfer or had taken no
 19 31 action to comply with local housing official orders within 60
 19 32 days after the filing of the petition.
 19 33    The division amends the definition of "building" in Code
 19 34 section 657A.1 to include buildings used or intended to be used
 19 35 for commercial or industrial purposes and makes corresponding
 20  1 amendments to refer to the local building code or local housing
 20  2 code, as applicable.
 20  3    Currently, Code section 657A.10A requires that service
 20  4 of notice of the filing of the petition for title be made
 20  5 on interested parties by certified mail and by posting on
 20  6 the building.  The division provides that service shall be
 20  7 by personal service or certified mail or, if service cannot
 20  8 be made by either method, by posting on the building and
 20  9 publication in a newspaper of general circulation in the city.
 20 10    The division also amends Code section 657A.10A to add to the
 20 11 listing of factors for the court to consider when determining
 20 12 whether property has been abandoned.
 20 13    Division VI allows the authority to enter into an agreement
 20 14 for a housing enterprise tax credit for certain housing
 20 15 businesses that had mailed applications to the authority prior
 20 16 to the July 1, 2014, repeal of the housing enterprise tax
 20 17 credit in Code section 15E.193B.
 20 18    The division states that the authority may enter into
 20 19 an agreement and issue housing enterprise tax credits to a
 20 20 housing business if the city or county mailed the application
 20 21 forms on or after June 1, 2014, and prior to July 1, 2014,
 20 22 but the applications were not received by the authority, the
 20 23 application forms submitted were approved by the necessary
 20 24 governing bodies and commissions, the authority determines
 20 25 the housing business would otherwise be eligible under the
 20 26 Code section that was repealed, and the city or county and the
 20 27 eligible housing business meet all other requirements of the
 20 28 housing enterprise tax credit program and of the agreement
 20 29 entered into with the economic development authority.
 20 30    The division takes effect upon enactment and applies
 20 31 retroactively to July 1, 2014.

 16 35 division requires the commissioner to also adopt rules for the
 17  1 implementation and adoption of the life cycle cost analysis.
 17  2    Division II of the bill amends language relating to wages
 17  3 paid to an intern under the science, technology, engineering,
 17  4 and mathematics internship program to specify that an Iowa
 17  5 employer may receive financial assistance from the state on a
 17  6 matching basis.  The division provides that if the authority
 17  7 offers financial assistance for a student at a small or
 17  8 medium sized Iowa firm that is an innovative business or for
 17  9 a science, technology, engineering, or mathematics student
 17 10 working with an Iowa employer, for every $2 earned by the
 17 11 student in wages, the employer's payment of $1 shall be
 17 12 matched by the authority with $1 on a reimbursement basis.
 17 13 The division requires the authority to administer the two
 17 14 components of the internship program in as similar a manner

 17 18 contracts for financial assistance entered into on or after
 17 19 July 1, 2014.
 17 20    Division III of the bill relates to reinvestment districts
 17 21 under Code chapter 15J and flood mitigation projects under
 17 22 Code chapter 418.  The division eliminates the prohibition on
 17 23 the flood mitigation board approving an amendment on or after
 17 24 July 1, 2018, to an existing district's plan.  The division
 17 25 modifies the definition of "governmental entity" for purposes
 17 26 of a flood mitigation project to include a joint board or other
 17 27 legal or administrative entity formed by a Code chapter 28F
 17 28 agreement entered into by one or more counties, one or more
 17 29 cities at least partly within the counties, and one or more
 17 30 Code chapter 358 sanitary districts or a combined water and
 17 31 sanitary district established by Code chapter 357 or 358 and
 17 32 located at least partly within the city or county.
 17 33    The division provides that, for purposes of funding a
 17 34 flood mitigation project, the sales tax increment area shall
 17 35 not include any parcels that are included in a reinvestment
 18  1 district established under Code chapter 15J.
 18  2    The division provides that transfers of sales tax increment
 18  3 revenue to a reinvestment district account shall be made
 18  4 prior to transfer of sales tax increment revenue to a flood
 18  5 mitigation project account. The division also provides that
 18  6 from the amounts transferred to reinvestment district accounts
 18  7 and flood mitigation project accounts the department of revenue
 18  8 shall retain the lesser of $25,000 or the actual cost of
 18  9 administering the specified transfers of sales tax increment
 18 10 revenue quarterly as a repayment receipt.  The bill provides
 18 11 the process for the retention of the revenue.
 18 12    The division is effective upon enactment.  The division
 18 13 applies retroactively to reinvestment districts designated
 18 14 under Code chapter 15J in existence on or after July 1, 2014,
 18 15 and flood mitigation project plan applications received before,
 18 16 on, or after the effective date of the division.  The sections
 18 17 of the division amending Code section 423.2, regarding the
 18 18 transfers of sales tax increment revenue to a reinvestment
 18 19 district and to a flood mitigation project account as well as
 18 20 the retention of repayment receipts, apply to transfers of
 18 21 sales tax revenues made on or after July 1, 2015.
 18 22    Division IV of the bill relates to enterprise zones.  The
 18 23 division allows a city or county and the economic development
 18 24 authority for compliance reasons to amend agreements made under
 18 25 the enterprise zone program as long as the amendments do not
 18 26 increase the amount of incentives awarded and the economic
 18 27 development authority board approves.
 18 28    Division V of the bill relates to nuisance properties
 18 29 and abandoned buildings. The division requires the economic
 18 30 development authority to establish a nuisance property
 18 31 remediation fund for the purpose of providing financial
 18 32 assistance to cities for the remediation of nuisance
 18 33 properties, abandoned buildings, and other structures.  The
 18 34 division provides that moneys in a fund established in the high
 18 35 quality jobs program may be deposited in the nuisance property
 19  1 remediation fund.  The division allows the authority to operate
 19  2 the fund as a revolving fund and to use moneys in the fund for
 19  3 purposes of the program, or the authority may transfer the
 19  4 moneys to other funds it has created.  However, the division
 19  5 states that the authority must use any money specifically
 19  6 appropriated for nuisance property remediation assistance for
 19  7 the program.  Moneys in the fund consist of appropriations and
 19  8 any other moneys lawfully available to the authority.  The
 19  9 authority may provide this assistance using a competitive
 19 10 scoring process.  The division requires the authority to enter
 19 11 into an agreement with the city concerning the assistance.  The
 19 12 division allows the authority to grant priority to cities with
 19 13 severe blighted areas, widespread dilapidated housing stock, or
 19 14 high rates of low and moderate income residents.
 19 15    Division V also makes changes to the authority of cities and
 19 16 counties relating to certain abandoned or unsafe buildings.
 19 17 Code chapter 657A allows a city or county to take action

 19 24 rehabilitation, Code section 657A.10A allows a city to file
 19 25 an action in district court to take title to an abandoned
 19 26 building.  The court may award title to the petitioning city if
 19 27 the court finds that the building is abandoned, using factors
 19 28 established in statute, or if the city establishes that all
 19 29 interested parties received proper notice and the interested
 19 30 parties either consented to the title transfer or had taken no
 19 31 action to comply with local housing official orders within 60
 19 32 days after the filing of the petition.
 19 33    The division amends the definition of "building" in Code
 19 34 section 657A.1 to include buildings used or intended to be used

 19 24 rehabilitation, Code section 657A.10A allows a city to file
 19 25 an action in district court to take title to an abandoned
 19 26 building.  The court may award title to the petitioning city if
 19 27 the court finds that the building is abandoned, using factors
 19 28 established in statute, or if the city establishes that all
 19 29 interested parties received proper notice and the interested
 19 30 parties either consented to the title transfer or had taken no
 19 31 action to comply with local housing official orders within 60
 19 32 days after the filing of the petition.
 19 33    The division amends the definition of "building" in Code
 19 34 section 657A.1 to include buildings used or intended to be used
 19 35 for commercial or industrial purposes and makes corresponding
 20  1 amendments to refer to the local building code or local housing
 20  2 code, as applicable.
 20  3    Currently, Code section 657A.10A requires that service
 20  4 of notice of the filing of the petition for title be made
 20  5 on interested parties by certified mail and by posting on
 20  6 the building.  The division provides that service shall be
 20  7 by personal service or certified mail or, if service cannot
 20  8 be made by either method, by posting on the building and
 20  9 publication in a newspaper of general circulation in the city.
 20 10    The division also amends Code section 657A.10A to add to the
 20 11 listing of factors for the court to consider when determining
 20 12 whether property has been abandoned.
 20 13    Division VI allows the authority to enter into an agreement
 20 14 for a housing enterprise tax credit for certain housing
 20 15 businesses that had mailed applications to the authority prior
 20 16 to the July 1, 2014, repeal of the housing enterprise tax
 20 17 credit in Code section 15E.193B.
 20 18    The division states that the authority may enter into
 20 19 an agreement and issue housing enterprise tax credits to a
 20 20 housing business if the city or county mailed the application
 20 21 forms on or after June 1, 2014, and prior to July 1, 2014,
 20 22 but the applications were not received by the authority, the
 20 23 application forms submitted were approved by the necessary
 20 24 governing bodies and commissions, the authority determines
 20 25 the housing business would otherwise be eligible under the
 20 26 Code section that was repealed, and the city or county and the
 20 27 eligible housing business meet all other requirements of the
 20 28 housing enterprise tax credit program and of the agreement
 20 29 entered into with the economic development authority.

 17  3 paid to an intern under the science, technology, engineering,
 17  4 and mathematics internship program to specify that an Iowa
 17  5 employer may receive financial assistance from the state on a

 17  7 offers financial assistance for a student at a small or
 17  8 medium sized Iowa firm that is an innovative business or for
 17  9 a science, technology, engineering, or mathematics student
 17 10 working with an Iowa employer, for every $2 earned by the
 17 11 student in wages, the employer's payment of $1 shall be
 17 12 matched by the authority with $1 on a reimbursement basis.
 17 13 The division requires the authority to administer the two
 17 14 components of the internship program in as similar a manner
 17 15 as possible. The division authorizes the authority to adopt
 17 16 emergency rules for this division of the bill.  The division
 17 17 takes effect upon enactment and applies retroactively to
 17 18 contracts for financial assistance entered into on or after

 17 22 Code chapter 418.  The division eliminates the prohibition on
 17 23 the flood mitigation board approving an amendment on or after
 17 24 July 1, 2018, to an existing district's plan.  The division
 17 25 modifies the definition of "governmental entity" for purposes
 17 26 of a flood mitigation project to include a joint board or other
 17 27 legal or administrative entity formed by a Code chapter 28F
 17 28 agreement entered into by one or more counties, one or more
 17 29 cities at least partly within the counties, and one or more
 17 30 Code chapter 358 sanitary districts or a combined water and
 17 31 sanitary district established by Code chapter 357 or 358 and
 17 32 located at least partly within the city or county.
 17 33    The division provides that, for purposes of funding a
 17 34 flood mitigation project, the sales tax increment area shall
 17 35 not include any parcels that are included in a reinvestment
 18  1 district established under Code chapter 15J.
 18  2    The division provides that transfers of sales tax increment
 18  3 revenue to a reinvestment district account shall be made
 18  4 prior to transfer of sales tax increment revenue to a flood
 18  5 mitigation project account. The division also provides that
 18  6 from the amounts transferred to reinvestment district accounts
 18  7 and flood mitigation project accounts the department of revenue
 18  8 shall retain the lesser of $25,000 or the actual cost of
 18  9 administering the specified transfers of sales tax increment
 18 10 revenue quarterly as a repayment receipt.  The bill provides
 18 11 the process for the retention of the revenue.
 18 12    The division is effective upon enactment.  The division
 18 13 applies retroactively to reinvestment districts designated
 18 14 under Code chapter 15J in existence on or after July 1, 2014,
 18 15 and flood mitigation project plan applications received before,
 18 16 on, or after the effective date of the division.  The sections
 18 17 of the division amending Code section 423.2, regarding the
 18 18 transfers of sales tax increment revenue to a reinvestment
 18 19 district and to a flood mitigation project account as well as
 18 20 the retention of repayment receipts, apply to transfers of
 18 21 sales tax revenues made on or after July 1, 2015.
 18 22    Division IV of the bill relates to enterprise zones.  The
 18 23 division allows a city or county and the economic development
 18 24 authority for compliance reasons to amend agreements made under
 18 25 the enterprise zone program as long as the amendments do not
 18 26 increase the amount of incentives awarded and the economic
 18 27 development authority board approves.
 18 28    Division V of the bill relates to nuisance properties
 18 29 and abandoned buildings. The division requires the economic
 18 30 development authority to establish a nuisance property
 18 31 remediation fund for the purpose of providing financial
 18 32 assistance to cities for the remediation of nuisance
 18 33 properties, abandoned buildings, and other structures.  The
 18 34 division provides that moneys in a fund established in the high
 18 35 quality jobs program may be deposited in the nuisance property
 19  1 remediation fund.  The division allows the authority to operate
 19  2 the fund as a revolving fund and to use moneys in the fund for
 19  3 purposes of the program, or the authority may transfer the
 19  4 moneys to other funds it has created.  However, the division
 19  5 states that the authority must use any money specifically
 19  6 appropriated for nuisance property remediation assistance for
 19  7 the program.  Moneys in the fund consist of appropriations and
 19  8 any other moneys lawfully available to the authority.  The
 19  9 authority may provide this assistance using a competitive
 19 10 scoring process.  The division requires the authority to enter
 19 11 into an agreement with the city concerning the assistance.  The
 19 12 division allows the authority to grant priority to cities with
 19 13 severe blighted areas, widespread dilapidated housing stock, or
 19 14 high rates of low and moderate income residents.
 19 15    Division V also makes changes to the authority of cities and
 19 16 counties relating to certain abandoned or unsafe buildings.
 19 17 Code chapter 657A allows a city or county to take action
 19 18 to abate by rehabilitation a building used primarily for
 19 19 residential purposes that meets the statutory definition of
 19 20 "abandoned" or "public nuisance", as those terms are defined
 19 21 by the Iowa Code.  The costs associated with rehabilitating
 19 22 the building that remain unpaid by the owner create a mortgage
 19 23 lien against the property.  In lieu of abatement through
 19 24 rehabilitation, Code section 657A.10A allows a city to file
 19 25 an action in district court to take title to an abandoned
 19 26 building.  The court may award title to the petitioning city if

 17 26 of a flood mitigation project to include a joint board or other
 17 27 legal or administrative entity formed by a Code chapter 28F
 17 28 agreement entered into by one or more counties, one or more

 18  7 and flood mitigation project accounts the department of revenue
 18  8 shall retain the lesser of $25,000 or the actual cost of
 18  9 administering the specified transfers of sales tax increment
 18 10 revenue quarterly as a repayment receipt.  The bill provides

 18 13 applies retroactively to reinvestment districts designated
 18 14 under Code chapter 15J in existence on or after July 1, 2014,
 18 15 and flood mitigation project plan applications received before,

 18 17 of the division amending Code section 423.2, regarding the
 18 18 transfers of sales tax increment revenue to a reinvestment
 18 19 district and to a flood mitigation project account as well as

 18 24 authority for compliance reasons to amend agreements made under

 18 33 properties, abandoned buildings, and other structures.  The
 18 34 division provides that moneys in a fund established in the high
 18 35 quality jobs program may be deposited in the nuisance property
 19  1 remediation fund.  The division allows the authority to operate
 19  2 the fund as a revolving fund and to use moneys in the fund for
 19  3 purposes of the program, or the authority may transfer the
 19  4 moneys to other funds it has created.  However, the division
 19  5 states that the authority must use any money specifically
 19  6 appropriated for nuisance property remediation assistance for
 19  7 the program.  Moneys in the fund consist of appropriations and
 19  8 any other moneys lawfully available to the authority.  The
 19  9 authority may provide this assistance using a competitive
 19 10 scoring process.  The division requires the authority to enter
 19 11 into an agreement with the city concerning the assistance.  The
 19 12 division allows the authority to grant priority to cities with
 19 13 severe blighted areas, widespread dilapidated housing stock, or

 19 19 residential purposes that meets the statutory definition of
 19 20 "abandoned" or "public nuisance", as those terms are defined
 19 21 by the Iowa Code.  The costs associated with rehabilitating
 19 22 the building that remain unpaid by the owner create a mortgage
 19 23 lien against the property.  In lieu of abatement through
 19 24 rehabilitation, Code section 657A.10A allows a city to file
 19 25 an action in district court to take title to an abandoned
 19 26 building.  The court may award title to the petitioning city if
 19 27 the court finds that the building is abandoned, using factors
 19 28 established in statute, or if the city establishes that all
 19 29 interested parties received proper notice and the interested
 19 30 parties either consented to the title transfer or had taken no
 19 31 action to comply with local housing official orders within 60
 19 32 days after the filing of the petition.
 19 33    The division amends the definition of "building" in Code

 17 25 modifies the definition of "governmental entity" for purposes
 17 26 of a flood mitigation project to include a joint board or other
 17 27 legal or administrative entity formed by a Code chapter 28F
 17 28 agreement entered into by one or more counties, one or more

 18  3 revenue to a reinvestment district account shall be made
 18  4 prior to transfer of sales tax increment revenue to a flood
 18  5 mitigation project account. The division also provides that
 18  6 from the amounts transferred to reinvestment district accounts
 18  7 and flood mitigation project accounts the department of revenue
 18  8 shall retain the lesser of $25,000 or the actual cost of
 18  9 administering the specified transfers of sales tax increment
 18 10 revenue quarterly as a repayment receipt.  The bill provides
 18 11 the process for the retention of the revenue.
 18 12    The division is effective upon enactment.  The division
 18 13 applies retroactively to reinvestment districts designated
 18 14 under Code chapter 15J in existence on or after July 1, 2014,
 18 15 and flood mitigation project plan applications received before,

 18 17 of the division amending Code section 423.2, regarding the
 18 18 transfers of sales tax increment revenue to a reinvestment
 18 19 district and to a flood mitigation project account as well as
 18 20 the retention of repayment receipts, apply to transfers of
 18 21 sales tax revenues made on or after July 1, 2015.
 18 22    Division IV of the bill relates to enterprise zones.  The
 18 23 division allows a city or county and the economic development
 18 24 authority for compliance reasons to amend agreements made under
 18 25 the enterprise zone program as long as the amendments do not
 18 26 increase the amount of incentives awarded and the economic
 18 27 development authority board approves.
 18 28    Division V of the bill relates to nuisance properties
 18 29 and abandoned buildings. The division requires the economic
 18 30 development authority to establish a nuisance property
 18 31 remediation fund for the purpose of providing financial
 18 32 assistance to cities for the remediation of nuisance
 18 33 properties, abandoned buildings, and other structures.  The
 18 34 division provides that moneys in a fund established in the high
 18 35 quality jobs program may be deposited in the nuisance property
 19  1 remediation fund.  The division allows the authority to operate
 19  2 the fund as a revolving fund and to use moneys in the fund for
 19  3 purposes of the program, or the authority may transfer the
 19  4 moneys to other funds it has created.  However, the division
 19  5 states that the authority must use any money specifically
 19  6 appropriated for nuisance property remediation assistance for
 19  7 the program.  Moneys in the fund consist of appropriations and
 19  8 any other moneys lawfully available to the authority.  The
 19  9 authority may provide this assistance using a competitive
 19 10 scoring process.  The division requires the authority to enter
 19 11 into an agreement with the city concerning the assistance.  The
 19 12 division allows the authority to grant priority to cities with
 19 13 severe blighted areas, widespread dilapidated housing stock, or
 19 14 high rates of low and moderate income residents.
 19 15    Division V also makes changes to the authority of cities and
 19 16 counties relating to certain abandoned or unsafe buildings.
 19 17 Code chapter 657A allows a city or county to take action
 19 18 to abate by rehabilitation a building used primarily for
 19 19 residential purposes that meets the statutory definition of
 19 20 "abandoned" or "public nuisance", as those terms are defined
 19 21 by the Iowa Code.  The costs associated with rehabilitating
 19 22 the building that remain unpaid by the owner create a mortgage
 19 23 lien against the property.  In lieu of abatement through
 19 24 rehabilitation, Code section 657A.10A allows a city to file
 19 25 an action in district court to take title to an abandoned
 19 26 building.  The court may award title to the petitioning city if
 19 27 the court finds that the building is abandoned, using factors
 19 28 established in statute, or if the city establishes that all
 19 29 interested parties received proper notice and the interested
 19 30 parties either consented to the title transfer or had taken no
 19 31 action to comply with local housing official orders within 60
 19 32 days after the filing of the petition.
 19 33    The division amends the definition of "building" in Code
 19 34 section 657A.1 to include buildings used or intended to be used
 19 35 for commercial or industrial purposes and makes corresponding
 20  1 amendments to refer to the local building code or local housing
 20  2 code, as applicable.
 20  3    Currently, Code section 657A.10A requires that service
 20  4 of notice of the filing of the petition for title be made
 20  5 on interested parties by certified mail and by posting on
 20  6 the building.  The division provides that service shall be
 20  7 by personal service or certified mail or, if service cannot
 20  8 be made by either method, by posting on the building and
 20  9 publication in a newspaper of general circulation in the city.
 20 10    The division also amends Code section 657A.10A to add to the
 20 11 listing of factors for the court to consider when determining
 20 12 whether property has been abandoned.
 20 13    Division VI allows the authority to enter into an agreement
 20 14 for a housing enterprise tax credit for certain housing
 20 15 businesses that had mailed applications to the authority prior
 20 16 to the July 1, 2014, repeal of the housing enterprise tax
 20 17 credit in Code section 15E.193B.
 20 18    The division states that the authority may enter into
 20 19 an agreement and issue housing enterprise tax credits to a
 20 20 housing business if the city or county mailed the application
 20 21 forms on or after June 1, 2014, and prior to July 1, 2014,
 20 22 but the applications were not received by the authority, the
 20 23 application forms submitted were approved by the necessary
 20 24 governing bodies and commissions, the authority determines
 20 25 the housing business would otherwise be eligible under the
 20 26 Code section that was repealed, and the city or county and the
 20 27 eligible housing business meet all other requirements of the
 20 28 housing enterprise tax credit program and of the agreement
 20 29 entered into with the economic development authority.

 18  7 and flood mitigation project accounts the department of revenue
 18  8 shall retain the lesser of $25,000 or the actual cost of

 18 10 revenue quarterly as a repayment receipt.  The bill provides
 18 11 the process for the retention of the revenue.
 18 12    The division is effective upon enactment.  The division
 18 13 applies retroactively to reinvestment districts designated
 18 14 under Code chapter 15J in existence on or after July 1, 2014,
 18 15 and flood mitigation project plan applications received before,

 18 17 of the division amending Code section 423.2, regarding the
 18 18 transfers of sales tax increment revenue to a reinvestment
 18 19 district and to a flood mitigation project account as well as
 18 20 the retention of repayment receipts, apply to transfers of
 18 21 sales tax revenues made on or after July 1, 2015.
 18 22    Division IV of the bill relates to enterprise zones.  The
 18 23 division allows a city or county and the economic development
 18 24 authority for compliance reasons to amend agreements made under
 18 25 the enterprise zone program as long as the amendments do not
 18 26 increase the amount of incentives awarded and the economic
 18 27 development authority board approves.
 18 28    Division V of the bill relates to nuisance properties
 18 29 and abandoned buildings. The division requires the economic
 18 30 development authority to establish a nuisance property
 18 31 remediation fund for the purpose of providing financial
 18 32 assistance to cities for the remediation of nuisance
 18 33 properties, abandoned buildings, and other structures.  The
 18 34 division provides that moneys in a fund established in the high
 18 35 quality jobs program may be deposited in the nuisance property
 19  1 remediation fund.  The division allows the authority to operate
 19  2 the fund as a revolving fund and to use moneys in the fund for
 19  3 purposes of the program, or the authority may transfer the
 19  4 moneys to other funds it has created.  However, the division
 19  5 states that the authority must use any money specifically
 19  6 appropriated for nuisance property remediation assistance for
 19  7 the program.  Moneys in the fund consist of appropriations and
 19  8 any other moneys lawfully available to the authority.  The
 19  9 authority may provide this assistance using a competitive
 19 10 scoring process.  The division requires the authority to enter
 19 11 into an agreement with the city concerning the assistance.  The
 19 12 division allows the authority to grant priority to cities with
 19 13 severe blighted areas, widespread dilapidated housing stock, or
 19 14 high rates of low and moderate income residents.
 19 15    Division V also makes changes to the authority of cities and
 19 16 counties relating to certain abandoned or unsafe buildings.
 19 17 Code chapter 657A allows a city or county to take action
 19 18 to abate by rehabilitation a building used primarily for
 19 19 residential purposes that meets the statutory definition of
 19 20 "abandoned" or "public nuisance", as those terms are defined
 19 21 by the Iowa Code.  The costs associated with rehabilitating
 19 22 the building that remain unpaid by the owner create a mortgage
 19 23 lien against the property.  In lieu of abatement through
 19 24 rehabilitation, Code section 657A.10A allows a city to file
 19 25 an action in district court to take title to an abandoned
 19 26 building.  The court may award title to the petitioning city if
 19 27 the court finds that the building is abandoned, using factors
 19 28 established in statute, or if the city establishes that all
 19 29 interested parties received proper notice and the interested
 19 30 parties either consented to the title transfer or had taken no
 19 31 action to comply with local housing official orders within 60
 19 32 days after the filing of the petition.
 19 33    The division amends the definition of "building" in Code
 19 34 section 657A.1 to include buildings used or intended to be used
 19 35 for commercial or industrial purposes and makes corresponding
 20  1 amendments to refer to the local building code or local housing
 20  2 code, as applicable.
 20  3    Currently, Code section 657A.10A requires that service
 20  4 of notice of the filing of the petition for title be made
 20  5 on interested parties by certified mail and by posting on
 20  6 the building.  The division provides that service shall be
 20  7 by personal service or certified mail or, if service cannot
 20  8 be made by either method, by posting on the building and
 20  9 publication in a newspaper of general circulation in the city.
 20 10    The division also amends Code section 657A.10A to add to the
 20 11 listing of factors for the court to consider when determining
 20 12 whether property has been abandoned.
 20 13    Division VI allows the authority to enter into an agreement
 20 14 for a housing enterprise tax credit for certain housing
 20 15 businesses that had mailed applications to the authority prior
 20 16 to the July 1, 2014, repeal of the housing enterprise tax
 20 17 credit in Code section 15E.193B.
 20 18    The division states that the authority may enter into
 20 19 an agreement and issue housing enterprise tax credits to a
 20 20 housing business if the city or county mailed the application
 20 21 forms on or after June 1, 2014, and prior to July 1, 2014,
 20 22 but the applications were not received by the authority, the
 20 23 application forms submitted were approved by the necessary
 20 24 governing bodies and commissions, the authority determines
 20 25 the housing business would otherwise be eligible under the
 20 26 Code section that was repealed, and the city or county and the
 20 27 eligible housing business meet all other requirements of the
 20 28 housing enterprise tax credit program and of the agreement
 20 29 entered into with the economic development authority.
 20 30    The division takes effect upon enactment and applies

 17 25 modifies the definition of "governmental entity" for purposes
 17 26 of a flood mitigation project to include a joint board or other
 17 27 legal or administrative entity formed by a Code chapter 28F
 17 28 agreement entered into by one or more counties, one or more
 17 29 cities at least partly within the counties, and one or more
 17 30 Code chapter 358 sanitary districts or a combined water and

 19  8 any other moneys lawfully available to the authority.  The
 19  9 authority may provide this assistance using a competitive
 19 10 scoring process.  The division requires the authority to enter
 19 11 into an agreement with the city concerning the assistance.  The
 19 12 division allows the authority to grant priority to cities with
 19 13 severe blighted areas, widespread dilapidated housing stock, or
 19 14 high rates of low and moderate income residents.
 19 15    Division V also makes changes to the authority of cities and
 19 16 counties relating to certain abandoned or unsafe buildings.
 19 17 Code chapter 657A allows a city or county to take action
 19 18 to abate by rehabilitation a building used primarily for
 19 19 residential purposes that meets the statutory definition of
 19 20 "abandoned" or "public nuisance", as those terms are defined
 19 21 by the Iowa Code.  The costs associated with rehabilitating
 19 22 the building that remain unpaid by the owner create a mortgage
 19 23 lien against the property.  In lieu of abatement through
 19 24 rehabilitation, Code section 657A.10A allows a city to file
 19 25 an action in district court to take title to an abandoned
 19 26 building.  The court may award title to the petitioning city if
 19 27 the court finds that the building is abandoned, using factors
 19 28 established in statute, or if the city establishes that all
 19 29 interested parties received proper notice and the interested
 19 30 parties either consented to the title transfer or had taken no
 19 31 action to comply with local housing official orders within 60
 19 32 days after the filing of the petition.
 19 33    The division amends the definition of "building" in Code
 19 34 section 657A.1 to include buildings used or intended to be used
 19 35 for commercial or industrial purposes and makes corresponding
 20  1 amendments to refer to the local building code or local housing
 20  2 code, as applicable.
 20  3    Currently, Code section 657A.10A requires that service
 20  4 of notice of the filing of the petition for title be made
 20  5 on interested parties by certified mail and by posting on
 20  6 the building.  The division provides that service shall be
 20  7 by personal service or certified mail or, if service cannot
 20  8 be made by either method, by posting on the building and
 20  9 publication in a newspaper of general circulation in the city.
 20 10    The division also amends Code section 657A.10A to add to the
 20 11 listing of factors for the court to consider when determining
 20 12 whether property has been abandoned.
 20 13    Division VI allows the authority to enter into an agreement
 20 14 for a housing enterprise tax credit for certain housing
 20 15 businesses that had mailed applications to the authority prior
 20 16 to the July 1, 2014, repeal of the housing enterprise tax
 20 17 credit in Code section 15E.193B.
 20 18    The division states that the authority may enter into
 20 19 an agreement and issue housing enterprise tax credits to a
 20 20 housing business if the city or county mailed the application
 20 21 forms on or after June 1, 2014, and prior to July 1, 2014,
 20 22 but the applications were not received by the authority, the
 20 23 application forms submitted were approved by the necessary
 20 24 governing bodies and commissions, the authority determines
 20 25 the housing business would otherwise be eligible under the
 20 26 Code section that was repealed, and the city or county and the
 20 27 eligible housing business meet all other requirements of the
 20 28 housing enterprise tax credit program and of the agreement
 20 29 entered into with the economic development authority.
 20 30    The division takes effect upon enactment and applies
 20 31 retroactively to July 1, 2014.

 17 15 as possible. The division authorizes the authority to adopt
 17 16 emergency rules for this division of the bill.  The division
 17 17 takes effect upon enactment and applies retroactively to
 17 18 contracts for financial assistance entered into on or after
 17 19 July 1, 2014.
 17 20    Division III of the bill relates to reinvestment districts
 17 21 under Code chapter 15J and flood mitigation projects under
 17 22 Code chapter 418.  The division eliminates the prohibition on
 17 23 the flood mitigation board approving an amendment on or after
 17 24 July 1, 2018, to an existing district's plan.  The division
 17 25 modifies the definition of "governmental entity" for purposes
 17 26 of a flood mitigation project to include a joint board or other
 17 27 legal or administrative entity formed by a Code chapter 28F
 17 28 agreement entered into by one or more counties, one or more
 17 29 cities at least partly within the counties, and one or more
 17 30 Code chapter 358 sanitary districts or a combined water and
 17 31 sanitary district established by Code chapter 357 or 358 and
 17 32 located at least partly within the city or county.
 17 33    The division provides that, for purposes of funding a
 17 34 flood mitigation project, the sales tax increment area shall
 17 35 not include any parcels that are included in a reinvestment
 18  1 district established under Code chapter 15J.
 18  2    The division provides that transfers of sales tax increment
 18  3 revenue to a reinvestment district account shall be made
 18  4 prior to transfer of sales tax increment revenue to a flood
 18  5 mitigation project account. The division also provides that
 18  6 from the amounts transferred to reinvestment district accounts
 18  7 and flood mitigation project accounts the department of revenue
 18  8 shall retain the lesser of $25,000 or the actual cost of
 18  9 administering the specified transfers of sales tax increment
 18 10 revenue quarterly as a repayment receipt.  The bill provides
 18 11 the process for the retention of the revenue.
 18 12    The division is effective upon enactment.  The division
 18 13 applies retroactively to reinvestment districts designated
 18 14 under Code chapter 15J in existence on or after July 1, 2014,
 18 15 and flood mitigation project plan applications received before,
 18 16 on, or after the effective date of the division.  The sections
 18 17 of the division amending Code section 423.2, regarding the
 18 18 transfers of sales tax increment revenue to a reinvestment
 18 19 district and to a flood mitigation project account as well as
 18 20 the retention of repayment receipts, apply to transfers of
 18 21 sales tax revenues made on or after July 1, 2015.
 18 22    Division IV of the bill relates to enterprise zones.  The
 18 23 division allows a city or county and the economic development
 18 24 authority for compliance reasons to amend agreements made under
 18 25 the enterprise zone program as long as the amendments do not
 18 26 increase the amount of incentives awarded and the economic
 18 27 development authority board approves.
 18 28    Division V of the bill relates to nuisance properties
 18 29 and abandoned buildings. The division requires the economic
 18 30 development authority to establish a nuisance property
 18 31 remediation fund for the purpose of providing financial
 18 32 assistance to cities for the remediation of nuisance
 18 33 properties, abandoned buildings, and other structures.  The
 18 34 division provides that moneys in a fund established in the high
 18 35 quality jobs program may be deposited in the nuisance property
 19  1 remediation fund.  The division allows the authority to operate
 19  2 the fund as a revolving fund and to use moneys in the fund for
 19  3 purposes of the program, or the authority may transfer the
 19  4 moneys to other funds it has created.  However, the division
 19  5 states that the authority must use any money specifically
 19  6 appropriated for nuisance property remediation assistance for
 19  7 the program.  Moneys in the fund consist of appropriations and
 19  8 any other moneys lawfully available to the authority.  The
 19  9 authority may provide this assistance using a competitive
 19 10 scoring process.  The division requires the authority to enter
 19 11 into an agreement with the city concerning the assistance.  The
 19 12 division allows the authority to grant priority to cities with
 19 13 severe blighted areas, widespread dilapidated housing stock, or
 19 14 high rates of low and moderate income residents.
 19 15    Division V also makes changes to the authority of cities and
 19 16 counties relating to certain abandoned or unsafe buildings.
 19 17 Code chapter 657A allows a city or county to take action
 19 18 to abate by rehabilitation a building used primarily for
 19 19 residential purposes that meets the statutory definition of
 19 20 "abandoned" or "public nuisance", as those terms are defined
 19 21 by the Iowa Code.  The costs associated with rehabilitating
 19 22 the building that remain unpaid by the owner create a mortgage
 19 23 lien against the property.  In lieu of abatement through
 19 24 rehabilitation, Code section 657A.10A allows a city to file
 19 25 an action in district court to take title to an abandoned
 19 26 building.  The court may award title to the petitioning city if
 19 27 the court finds that the building is abandoned, using factors
 19 28 established in statute, or if the city establishes that all
 19 29 interested parties received proper notice and the interested
 19 30 parties either consented to the title transfer or had taken no
 19 31 action to comply with local housing official orders within 60
 19 32 days after the filing of the petition.
 19 33    The division amends the definition of "building" in Code
 19 34 section 657A.1 to include buildings used or intended to be used
 19 35 for commercial or industrial purposes and makes corresponding
 20  1 amendments to refer to the local building code or local housing
 20  2 code, as applicable.
 20  3    Currently, Code section 657A.10A requires that service
 20  4 of notice of the filing of the petition for title be made
 20  5 on interested parties by certified mail and by posting on
 20  6 the building.  The division provides that service shall be
 20  7 by personal service or certified mail or, if service cannot
 20  8 be made by either method, by posting on the building and
 20  9 publication in a newspaper of general circulation in the city.
 20 10    The division also amends Code section 657A.10A to add to the
 20 11 listing of factors for the court to consider when determining
 20 12 whether property has been abandoned.
 20 13    Division VI allows the authority to enter into an agreement
 20 14 for a housing enterprise tax credit for certain housing
 20 15 businesses that had mailed applications to the authority prior
 20 16 to the July 1, 2014, repeal of the housing enterprise tax
 20 17 credit in Code section 15E.193B.
 20 18    The division states that the authority may enter into
 20 19 an agreement and issue housing enterprise tax credits to a
 20 20 housing business if the city or county mailed the application
 20 21 forms on or after June 1, 2014, and prior to July 1, 2014,

 20 27 eligible housing business meet all other requirements of the
 20 28 housing enterprise tax credit program and of the agreement
 20 29 entered into with the economic development authority.

 17 22 Code chapter 418.  The division eliminates the prohibition on
 17 23 the flood mitigation board approving an amendment on or after
 17 24 July 1, 2018, to an existing district's plan.  The division
 17 25 modifies the definition of "governmental entity" for purposes
 17 26 of a flood mitigation project to include a joint board or other
 17 27 legal or administrative entity formed by a Code chapter 28F
 17 28 agreement entered into by one or more counties, one or more
 17 29 cities at least partly within the counties, and one or more
 17 30 Code chapter 358 sanitary districts or a combined water and
 17 31 sanitary district established by Code chapter 357 or 358 and

 17 35 not include any parcels that are included in a reinvestment
 18  1 district established under Code chapter 15J.
 18  2    The division provides that transfers of sales tax increment
 18  3 revenue to a reinvestment district account shall be made
 18  4 prior to transfer of sales tax increment revenue to a flood
 18  5 mitigation project account. The division also provides that
 18  6 from the amounts transferred to reinvestment district accounts
 18  7 and flood mitigation project accounts the department of revenue
 18  8 shall retain the lesser of $25,000 or the actual cost of
 18  9 administering the specified transfers of sales tax increment
 18 10 revenue quarterly as a repayment receipt.  The bill provides
 18 11 the process for the retention of the revenue.
 18 12    The division is effective upon enactment.  The division
 18 13 applies retroactively to reinvestment districts designated
 18 14 under Code chapter 15J in existence on or after July 1, 2014,
 18 15 and flood mitigation project plan applications received before,
 18 16 on, or after the effective date of the division.  The sections
 18 17 of the division amending Code section 423.2, regarding the
 18 18 transfers of sales tax increment revenue to a reinvestment
 18 19 district and to a flood mitigation project account as well as
 18 20 the retention of repayment receipts, apply to transfers of
 18 21 sales tax revenues made on or after July 1, 2015.
 18 22    Division IV of the bill relates to enterprise zones.  The
 18 23 division allows a city or county and the economic development
 18 24 authority for compliance reasons to amend agreements made under
 18 25 the enterprise zone program as long as the amendments do not
 18 26 increase the amount of incentives awarded and the economic
 18 27 development authority board approves.
 18 28    Division V of the bill relates to nuisance properties
 18 29 and abandoned buildings. The division requires the economic
 18 30 development authority to establish a nuisance property
 18 31 remediation fund for the purpose of providing financial
 18 32 assistance to cities for the remediation of nuisance
 18 33 properties, abandoned buildings, and other structures.  The
 18 34 division provides that moneys in a fund established in the high
 18 35 quality jobs program may be deposited in the nuisance property
 19  1 remediation fund.  The division allows the authority to operate
 19  2 the fund as a revolving fund and to use moneys in the fund for
 19  3 purposes of the program, or the authority may transfer the
 19  4 moneys to other funds it has created.  However, the division
 19  5 states that the authority must use any money specifically
 19  6 appropriated for nuisance property remediation assistance for
 19  7 the program.  Moneys in the fund consist of appropriations and
 19  8 any other moneys lawfully available to the authority.  The
 19  9 authority may provide this assistance using a competitive
 19 10 scoring process.  The division requires the authority to enter
 19 11 into an agreement with the city concerning the assistance.  The
 19 12 division allows the authority to grant priority to cities with
 19 13 severe blighted areas, widespread dilapidated housing stock, or
 19 14 high rates of low and moderate income residents.
 19 15    Division V also makes changes to the authority of cities and
 19 16 counties relating to certain abandoned or unsafe buildings.
 19 17 Code chapter 657A allows a city or county to take action
 19 18 to abate by rehabilitation a building used primarily for
 19 19 residential purposes that meets the statutory definition of
 19 20 "abandoned" or "public nuisance", as those terms are defined
 19 21 by the Iowa Code.  The costs associated with rehabilitating
 19 22 the building that remain unpaid by the owner create a mortgage
 19 23 lien against the property.  In lieu of abatement through
 19 24 rehabilitation, Code section 657A.10A allows a city to file
 19 25 an action in district court to take title to an abandoned
 19 26 building.  The court may award title to the petitioning city if
 19 27 the court finds that the building is abandoned, using factors
 19 28 established in statute, or if the city establishes that all
 19 29 interested parties received proper notice and the interested
 19 30 parties either consented to the title transfer or had taken no
 19 31 action to comply with local housing official orders within 60
 19 32 days after the filing of the petition.
 19 33    The division amends the definition of "building" in Code
 19 34 section 657A.1 to include buildings used or intended to be used
 19 35 for commercial or industrial purposes and makes corresponding
 20  1 amendments to refer to the local building code or local housing
 20  2 code, as applicable.
 20  3    Currently, Code section 657A.10A requires that service
 20  4 of notice of the filing of the petition for title be made
 20  5 on interested parties by certified mail and by posting on
 20  6 the building.  The division provides that service shall be

 17 22 Code chapter 418.  The division eliminates the prohibition on
 17 23 the flood mitigation board approving an amendment on or after

 17 25 modifies the definition of "governmental entity" for purposes
 17 26 of a flood mitigation project to include a joint board or other
 17 27 legal or administrative entity formed by a Code chapter 28F
 17 28 agreement entered into by one or more counties, one or more

 18  5 mitigation project account. The division also provides that
 18  6 from the amounts transferred to reinvestment district accounts
 18  7 and flood mitigation project accounts the department of revenue
 18  8 shall retain the lesser of $25,000 or the actual cost of
 18  9 administering the specified transfers of sales tax increment
 18 10 revenue quarterly as a repayment receipt.  The bill provides
 18 11 the process for the retention of the revenue.

 18 13 applies retroactively to reinvestment districts designated
 18 14 under Code chapter 15J in existence on or after July 1, 2014,
 18 15 and flood mitigation project plan applications received before,

 18 17 of the division amending Code section 423.2, regarding the
 18 18 transfers of sales tax increment revenue to a reinvestment
 18 19 district and to a flood mitigation project account as well as
 18 20 the retention of repayment receipts, apply to transfers of
 18 21 sales tax revenues made on or after July 1, 2015.
 18 22    Division IV of the bill relates to enterprise zones.  The
 18 23 division allows a city or county and the economic development
 18 24 authority for compliance reasons to amend agreements made under
 18 25 the enterprise zone program as long as the amendments do not
 18 26 increase the amount of incentives awarded and the economic
 18 27 development authority board approves.
 18 28    Division V of the bill relates to nuisance properties
 18 29 and abandoned buildings. The division requires the economic
 18 30 development authority to establish a nuisance property
 18 31 remediation fund for the purpose of providing financial
 18 32 assistance to cities for the remediation of nuisance
 18 33 properties, abandoned buildings, and other structures.  The
 18 34 division provides that moneys in a fund established in the high
 18 35 quality jobs program may be deposited in the nuisance property
 19  1 remediation fund.  The division allows the authority to operate
 19  2 the fund as a revolving fund and to use moneys in the fund for
 19  3 purposes of the program, or the authority may transfer the
 19  4 moneys to other funds it has created.  However, the division
 19  5 states that the authority must use any money specifically
 19  6 appropriated for nuisance property remediation assistance for
 19  7 the program.  Moneys in the fund consist of appropriations and
 19  8 any other moneys lawfully available to the authority.  The
 19  9 authority may provide this assistance using a competitive
 19 10 scoring process.  The division requires the authority to enter
 19 11 into an agreement with the city concerning the assistance.  The
 19 12 division allows the authority to grant priority to cities with
 19 13 severe blighted areas, widespread dilapidated housing stock, or
 19 14 high rates of low and moderate income residents.
 19 15    Division V also makes changes to the authority of cities and
 19 16 counties relating to certain abandoned or unsafe buildings.
 19 17 Code chapter 657A allows a city or county to take action
 19 18 to abate by rehabilitation a building used primarily for
 19 19 residential purposes that meets the statutory definition of
 19 20 "abandoned" or "public nuisance", as those terms are defined
 19 21 by the Iowa Code.  The costs associated with rehabilitating
 19 22 the building that remain unpaid by the owner create a mortgage
 19 23 lien against the property.  In lieu of abatement through
 19 24 rehabilitation, Code section 657A.10A allows a city to file
 19 25 an action in district court to take title to an abandoned
 19 26 building.  The court may award title to the petitioning city if
 19 27 the court finds that the building is abandoned, using factors
 19 28 established in statute, or if the city establishes that all
 19 29 interested parties received proper notice and the interested
 19 30 parties either consented to the title transfer or had taken no
 19 31 action to comply with local housing official orders within 60
 19 32 days after the filing of the petition.
 19 33    The division amends the definition of "building" in Code
 19 34 section 657A.1 to include buildings used or intended to be used
 19 35 for commercial or industrial purposes and makes corresponding
 20  1 amendments to refer to the local building code or local housing
 20  2 code, as applicable.
 20  3    Currently, Code section 657A.10A requires that service
 20  4 of notice of the filing of the petition for title be made
 20  5 on interested parties by certified mail and by posting on
 20  6 the building.  The division provides that service shall be
 20  7 by personal service or certified mail or, if service cannot
 20  8 be made by either method, by posting on the building and
 20  9 publication in a newspaper of general circulation in the city.
 20 10    The division also amends Code section 657A.10A to add to the

 20 15 businesses that had mailed applications to the authority prior
 20 16 to the July 1, 2014, repeal of the housing enterprise tax
 20 17 credit in Code section 15E.193B.
 20 18    The division states that the authority may enter into
 20 19 an agreement and issue housing enterprise tax credits to a
 20 20 housing business if the city or county mailed the application
 20 21 forms on or after June 1, 2014, and prior to July 1, 2014,
 20 22 but the applications were not received by the authority, the
 20 23 application forms submitted were approved by the necessary

 17 20    Division III of the bill relates to reinvestment districts
 17 21 under Code chapter 15J and flood mitigation projects under
 17 22 Code chapter 418.  The division eliminates the prohibition on
 17 23 the flood mitigation board approving an amendment on or after
 17 24 July 1, 2018, to an existing district's plan.  The division
 17 25 modifies the definition of "governmental entity" for purposes
 17 26 of a flood mitigation project to include a joint board or other
 17 27 legal or administrative entity formed by a Code chapter 28F
 17 28 agreement entered into by one or more counties, one or more
 17 29 cities at least partly within the counties, and one or more

 17 34 flood mitigation project, the sales tax increment area shall
 17 35 not include any parcels that are included in a reinvestment
 18  1 district established under Code chapter 15J.
 18  2    The division provides that transfers of sales tax increment
 18  3 revenue to a reinvestment district account shall be made
 18  4 prior to transfer of sales tax increment revenue to a flood
 18  5 mitigation project account. The division also provides that
 18  6 from the amounts transferred to reinvestment district accounts
 18  7 and flood mitigation project accounts the department of revenue
 18  8 shall retain the lesser of $25,000 or the actual cost of
 18  9 administering the specified transfers of sales tax increment
 18 10 revenue quarterly as a repayment receipt.  The bill provides
 18 11 the process for the retention of the revenue.

 18 13 applies retroactively to reinvestment districts designated
 18 14 under Code chapter 15J in existence on or after July 1, 2014,
 18 15 and flood mitigation project plan applications received before,

 18 17 of the division amending Code section 423.2, regarding the
 18 18 transfers of sales tax increment revenue to a reinvestment
 18 19 district and to a flood mitigation project account as well as
 18 20 the retention of repayment receipts, apply to transfers of
 18 21 sales tax revenues made on or after July 1, 2015.
 18 22    Division IV of the bill relates to enterprise zones.  The
 18 23 division allows a city or county and the economic development
 18 24 authority for compliance reasons to amend agreements made under
 18 25 the enterprise zone program as long as the amendments do not
 18 26 increase the amount of incentives awarded and the economic
 18 27 development authority board approves.
 18 28    Division V of the bill relates to nuisance properties
 18 29 and abandoned buildings. The division requires the economic
 18 30 development authority to establish a nuisance property
 18 31 remediation fund for the purpose of providing financial
 18 32 assistance to cities for the remediation of nuisance
 18 33 properties, abandoned buildings, and other structures.  The
 18 34 division provides that moneys in a fund established in the high
 18 35 quality jobs program may be deposited in the nuisance property
 19  1 remediation fund.  The division allows the authority to operate
 19  2 the fund as a revolving fund and to use moneys in the fund for
 19  3 purposes of the program, or the authority may transfer the
 19  4 moneys to other funds it has created.  However, the division
 19  5 states that the authority must use any money specifically
 19  6 appropriated for nuisance property remediation assistance for
 19  7 the program.  Moneys in the fund consist of appropriations and
 19  8 any other moneys lawfully available to the authority.  The
 19  9 authority may provide this assistance using a competitive
 19 10 scoring process.  The division requires the authority to enter
 19 11 into an agreement with the city concerning the assistance.  The
 19 12 division allows the authority to grant priority to cities with
 19 13 severe blighted areas, widespread dilapidated housing stock, or
 19 14 high rates of low and moderate income residents.
 19 15    Division V also makes changes to the authority of cities and
 19 16 counties relating to certain abandoned or unsafe buildings.
 19 17 Code chapter 657A allows a city or county to take action
 19 18 to abate by rehabilitation a building used primarily for
 19 19 residential purposes that meets the statutory definition of
 19 20 "abandoned" or "public nuisance", as those terms are defined
 19 21 by the Iowa Code.  The costs associated with rehabilitating
 19 22 the building that remain unpaid by the owner create a mortgage
 19 23 lien against the property.  In lieu of abatement through
 19 24 rehabilitation, Code section 657A.10A allows a city to file
 19 25 an action in district court to take title to an abandoned
 19 26 building.  The court may award title to the petitioning city if
 19 27 the court finds that the building is abandoned, using factors
 19 28 established in statute, or if the city establishes that all
 19 29 interested parties received proper notice and the interested
 19 30 parties either consented to the title transfer or had taken no
 19 31 action to comply with local housing official orders within 60
 19 32 days after the filing of the petition.
 19 33    The division amends the definition of "building" in Code
 19 34 section 657A.1 to include buildings used or intended to be used
 19 35 for commercial or industrial purposes and makes corresponding
 20  1 amendments to refer to the local building code or local housing
 20  2 code, as applicable.
 20  3    Currently, Code section 657A.10A requires that service
 20  4 of notice of the filing of the petition for title be made
 20  5 on interested parties by certified mail and by posting on
 20  6 the building.  The division provides that service shall be
 20  7 by personal service or certified mail or, if service cannot
 20  8 be made by either method, by posting on the building and
 20  9 publication in a newspaper of general circulation in the city.
 20 10    The division also amends Code section 657A.10A to add to the
 20 11 listing of factors for the court to consider when determining
 20 12 whether property has been abandoned.
 20 13    Division VI allows the authority to enter into an agreement
 20 14 for a housing enterprise tax credit for certain housing
 20 15 businesses that had mailed applications to the authority prior
 20 16 to the July 1, 2014, repeal of the housing enterprise tax
 20 17 credit in Code section 15E.193B.
 20 18    The division states that the authority may enter into
 20 19 an agreement and issue housing enterprise tax credits to a
 20 20 housing business if the city or county mailed the application
 20 21 forms on or after June 1, 2014, and prior to July 1, 2014,
 20 22 but the applications were not received by the authority, the
 20 23 application forms submitted were approved by the necessary
 20 24 governing bodies and commissions, the authority determines
 20 25 the housing business would otherwise be eligible under the
 20 26 Code section that was repealed, and the city or county and the
 20 27 eligible housing business meet all other requirements of the
 20 28 housing enterprise tax credit program and of the agreement
 20 29 entered into with the economic development authority.

 17 25 modifies the definition of "governmental entity" for purposes
 17 26 of a flood mitigation project to include a joint board or other
 17 27 legal or administrative entity formed by a Code chapter 28F
 17 28 agreement entered into by one or more counties, one or more

 18  1 district established under Code chapter 15J.
 18  2    The division provides that transfers of sales tax increment
 18  3 revenue to a reinvestment district account shall be made

 18  7 and flood mitigation project accounts the department of revenue
 18  8 shall retain the lesser of $25,000 or the actual cost of

 18 10 revenue quarterly as a repayment receipt.  The bill provides

 18 17 of the division amending Code section 423.2, regarding the
 18 18 transfers of sales tax increment revenue to a reinvestment
 18 19 district and to a flood mitigation project account as well as
 18 20 the retention of repayment receipts, apply to transfers of
 18 21 sales tax revenues made on or after July 1, 2015.
 18 22    Division IV of the bill relates to enterprise zones.  The
 18 23 division allows a city or county and the economic development
 18 24 authority for compliance reasons to amend agreements made under
 18 25 the enterprise zone program as long as the amendments do not
 18 26 increase the amount of incentives awarded and the economic

 18 33 properties, abandoned buildings, and other structures.  The
 18 34 division provides that moneys in a fund established in the high
 18 35 quality jobs program may be deposited in the nuisance property
 19  1 remediation fund.  The division allows the authority to operate
 19  2 the fund as a revolving fund and to use moneys in the fund for

 19  6 appropriated for nuisance property remediation assistance for
 19  7 the program.  Moneys in the fund consist of appropriations and
 19  8 any other moneys lawfully available to the authority.  The
 19  9 authority may provide this assistance using a competitive
 19 10 scoring process.  The division requires the authority to enter

 19 12 division allows the authority to grant priority to cities with
 19 13 severe blighted areas, widespread dilapidated housing stock, or
 19 14 high rates of low and moderate income residents.
 19 15    Division V also makes changes to the authority of cities and
 19 16 counties relating to certain abandoned or unsafe buildings.

 19 24 rehabilitation, Code section 657A.10A allows a city to file
 19 25 an action in district court to take title to an abandoned
 19 26 building.  The court may award title to the petitioning city if
 19 27 the court finds that the building is abandoned, using factors
 19 28 established in statute, or if the city establishes that all
 19 29 interested parties received proper notice and the interested
 19 30 parties either consented to the title transfer or had taken no
 19 31 action to comply with local housing official orders within 60
 19 32 days after the filing of the petition.
 19 33    The division amends the definition of "building" in Code
 19 34 section 657A.1 to include buildings used or intended to be used
 19 35 for commercial or industrial purposes and makes corresponding

 19  4 moneys to other funds it has created.  However, the division
 19  5 states that the authority must use any money specifically
 19  6 appropriated for nuisance property remediation assistance for
 19  7 the program.  Moneys in the fund consist of appropriations and
 19  8 any other moneys lawfully available to the authority.  The
 19  9 authority may provide this assistance using a competitive
 19 10 scoring process.  The division requires the authority to enter
 19 11 into an agreement with the city concerning the assistance.  The
 19 12 division allows the authority to grant priority to cities with
 19 13 severe blighted areas, widespread dilapidated housing stock, or
 19 14 high rates of low and moderate income residents.
 19 15    Division V also makes changes to the authority of cities and
 19 16 counties relating to certain abandoned or unsafe buildings.
 19 17 Code chapter 657A allows a city or county to take action
 19 18 to abate by rehabilitation a building used primarily for
 19 19 residential purposes that meets the statutory definition of
 19 20 "abandoned" or "public nuisance", as those terms are defined
 19 21 by the Iowa Code.  The costs associated with rehabilitating
 19 22 the building that remain unpaid by the owner create a mortgage
 19 23 lien against the property.  In lieu of abatement through
 19 24 rehabilitation, Code section 657A.10A allows a city to file
 19 25 an action in district court to take title to an abandoned
 19 26 building.  The court may award title to the petitioning city if
 19 27 the court finds that the building is abandoned, using factors
 19 28 established in statute, or if the city establishes that all
 19 29 interested parties received proper notice and the interested
 19 30 parties either consented to the title transfer or had taken no
 19 31 action to comply with local housing official orders within 60
 19 32 days after the filing of the petition.
 19 33    The division amends the definition of "building" in Code
 19 34 section 657A.1 to include buildings used or intended to be used
 19 35 for commercial or industrial purposes and makes corresponding
 20  1 amendments to refer to the local building code or local housing
 20  2 code, as applicable.
 20  3    Currently, Code section 657A.10A requires that service
 20  4 of notice of the filing of the petition for title be made
 20  5 on interested parties by certified mail and by posting on
 20  6 the building.  The division provides that service shall be
 20  7 by personal service or certified mail or, if service cannot
 20  8 be made by either method, by posting on the building and
 20  9 publication in a newspaper of general circulation in the city.
 20 10    The division also amends Code section 657A.10A to add to the
 20 11 listing of factors for the court to consider when determining
 20 12 whether property has been abandoned.
 20 13    Division VI allows the authority to enter into an agreement
 20 14 for a housing enterprise tax credit for certain housing
 20 15 businesses that had mailed applications to the authority prior
 20 16 to the July 1, 2014, repeal of the housing enterprise tax
 20 17 credit in Code section 15E.193B.
 20 18    The division states that the authority may enter into
 20 19 an agreement and issue housing enterprise tax credits to a
 20 20 housing business if the city or county mailed the application
 20 21 forms on or after June 1, 2014, and prior to July 1, 2014,
 20 22 but the applications were not received by the authority, the
 20 23 application forms submitted were approved by the necessary
 20 24 governing bodies and commissions, the authority determines
 20 25 the housing business would otherwise be eligible under the
 20 26 Code section that was repealed, and the city or county and the
 20 27 eligible housing business meet all other requirements of the
 20 28 housing enterprise tax credit program and of the agreement
 20 29 entered into with the economic development authority.

 17 22 Code chapter 418.  The division eliminates the prohibition on
 17 23 the flood mitigation board approving an amendment on or after
 17 24 July 1, 2018, to an existing district's plan.  The division
 17 25 modifies the definition of "governmental entity" for purposes
 17 26 of a flood mitigation project to include a joint board or other
 17 27 legal or administrative entity formed by a Code chapter 28F
 17 28 agreement entered into by one or more counties, one or more
 17 29 cities at least partly within the counties, and one or more
 17 30 Code chapter 358 sanitary districts or a combined water and
 17 31 sanitary district established by Code chapter 357 or 358 and
 17 32 located at least partly within the city or county.
 17 33    The division provides that, for purposes of funding a
 17 34 flood mitigation project, the sales tax increment area shall
 17 35 not include any parcels that are included in a reinvestment
 18  1 district established under Code chapter 15J.
 18  2    The division provides that transfers of sales tax increment
 18  3 revenue to a reinvestment district account shall be made
 18  4 prior to transfer of sales tax increment revenue to a flood
 18  5 mitigation project account. The division also provides that
 18  6 from the amounts transferred to reinvestment district accounts
 18  7 and flood mitigation project accounts the department of revenue
 18  8 shall retain the lesser of $25,000 or the actual cost of
 18  9 administering the specified transfers of sales tax increment
 18 10 revenue quarterly as a repayment receipt.  The bill provides
 18 11 the process for the retention of the revenue.
 18 12    The division is effective upon enactment.  The division
 18 13 applies retroactively to reinvestment districts designated
 18 14 under Code chapter 15J in existence on or after July 1, 2014,
 18 15 and flood mitigation project plan applications received before,
 18 16 on, or after the effective date of the division.  The sections
 18 17 of the division amending Code section 423.2, regarding the
 18 18 transfers of sales tax increment revenue to a reinvestment
 18 19 district and to a flood mitigation project account as well as
 18 20 the retention of repayment receipts, apply to transfers of
 18 21 sales tax revenues made on or after July 1, 2015.
 18 22    Division IV of the bill relates to enterprise zones.  The
 18 23 division allows a city or county and the economic development
 18 24 authority for compliance reasons to amend agreements made under
 18 25 the enterprise zone program as long as the amendments do not
 18 26 increase the amount of incentives awarded and the economic
 18 27 development authority board approves.
 18 28    Division V of the bill relates to nuisance properties
 18 29 and abandoned buildings. The division requires the economic
 18 30 development authority to establish a nuisance property
 18 31 remediation fund for the purpose of providing financial
 18 32 assistance to cities for the remediation of nuisance
 18 33 properties, abandoned buildings, and other structures.  The
 18 34 division provides that moneys in a fund established in the high
 18 35 quality jobs program may be deposited in the nuisance property
 19  1 remediation fund.  The division allows the authority to operate
 19  2 the fund as a revolving fund and to use moneys in the fund for
 19  3 purposes of the program, or the authority may transfer the
 19  4 moneys to other funds it has created.  However, the division
 19  5 states that the authority must use any money specifically
 19  6 appropriated for nuisance property remediation assistance for
 19  7 the program.  Moneys in the fund consist of appropriations and
 19  8 any other moneys lawfully available to the authority.  The
 19  9 authority may provide this assistance using a competitive
 19 10 scoring process.  The division requires the authority to enter

 19 12 division allows the authority to grant priority to cities with
 19 13 severe blighted areas, widespread dilapidated housing stock, or

 19 35 for commercial or industrial purposes and makes corresponding
 20  1 amendments to refer to the local building code or local housing

 18  7 and flood mitigation project accounts the department of revenue
 18  8 shall retain the lesser of $25,000 or the actual cost of
 18  9 administering the specified transfers of sales tax increment
 18 10 revenue quarterly as a repayment receipt.  The bill provides
 18 11 the process for the retention of the revenue.
 18 12    The division is effective upon enactment.  The division
 18 13 applies retroactively to reinvestment districts designated
 18 14 under Code chapter 15J in existence on or after July 1, 2014,
 18 15 and flood mitigation project plan applications received before,
 18 16 on, or after the effective date of the division.  The sections
 18 17 of the division amending Code section 423.2, regarding the
 18 18 transfers of sales tax increment revenue to a reinvestment
 18 19 district and to a flood mitigation project account as well as
 18 20 the retention of repayment receipts, apply to transfers of
 18 21 sales tax revenues made on or after July 1, 2015.
 18 22    Division IV of the bill relates to enterprise zones.  The
 18 23 division allows a city or county and the economic development
 18 24 authority for compliance reasons to amend agreements made under
 18 25 the enterprise zone program as long as the amendments do not
 18 26 increase the amount of incentives awarded and the economic
 18 27 development authority board approves.
 18 28    Division V of the bill relates to nuisance properties
 18 29 and abandoned buildings. The division requires the economic
 18 30 development authority to establish a nuisance property
 18 31 remediation fund for the purpose of providing financial
 18 32 assistance to cities for the remediation of nuisance
 18 33 properties, abandoned buildings, and other structures.  The
 18 34 division provides that moneys in a fund established in the high
 18 35 quality jobs program may be deposited in the nuisance property
 19  1 remediation fund.  The division allows the authority to operate
 19  2 the fund as a revolving fund and to use moneys in the fund for
 19  3 purposes of the program, or the authority may transfer the
 19  4 moneys to other funds it has created.  However, the division
 19  5 states that the authority must use any money specifically
 19  6 appropriated for nuisance property remediation assistance for
 19  7 the program.  Moneys in the fund consist of appropriations and
 19  8 any other moneys lawfully available to the authority.  The
 19  9 authority may provide this assistance using a competitive
 19 10 scoring process.  The division requires the authority to enter
 19 11 into an agreement with the city concerning the assistance.  The
 19 12 division allows the authority to grant priority to cities with
 19 13 severe blighted areas, widespread dilapidated housing stock, or
 19 14 high rates of low and moderate income residents.
 19 15    Division V also makes changes to the authority of cities and
 19 16 counties relating to certain abandoned or unsafe buildings.
 19 17 Code chapter 657A allows a city or county to take action
 19 18 to abate by rehabilitation a building used primarily for
 19 19 residential purposes that meets the statutory definition of
 19 20 "abandoned" or "public nuisance", as those terms are defined
 19 21 by the Iowa Code.  The costs associated with rehabilitating
 19 22 the building that remain unpaid by the owner create a mortgage
 19 23 lien against the property.  In lieu of abatement through
 19 24 rehabilitation, Code section 657A.10A allows a city to file
 19 25 an action in district court to take title to an abandoned
 19 26 building.  The court may award title to the petitioning city if
 19 27 the court finds that the building is abandoned, using factors
 19 28 established in statute, or if the city establishes that all
 19 29 interested parties received proper notice and the interested
 19 30 parties either consented to the title transfer or had taken no
 19 31 action to comply with local housing official orders within 60
 19 32 days after the filing of the petition.
 19 33    The division amends the definition of "building" in Code
 19 34 section 657A.1 to include buildings used or intended to be used
 19 35 for commercial or industrial purposes and makes corresponding
 20  1 amendments to refer to the local building code or local housing
 20  2 code, as applicable.
 20  3    Currently, Code section 657A.10A requires that service
 20  4 of notice of the filing of the petition for title be made
 20  5 on interested parties by certified mail and by posting on
 20  6 the building.  The division provides that service shall be
 20  7 by personal service or certified mail or, if service cannot
 20  8 be made by either method, by posting on the building and
 20  9 publication in a newspaper of general circulation in the city.
 20 10    The division also amends Code section 657A.10A to add to the
 20 11 listing of factors for the court to consider when determining
 20 12 whether property has been abandoned.
 20 13    Division VI allows the authority to enter into an agreement
 20 14 for a housing enterprise tax credit for certain housing
 20 15 businesses that had mailed applications to the authority prior
 20 16 to the July 1, 2014, repeal of the housing enterprise tax
 20 17 credit in Code section 15E.193B.
 20 18    The division states that the authority may enter into
 20 19 an agreement and issue housing enterprise tax credits to a
 20 20 housing business if the city or county mailed the application
 20 21 forms on or after June 1, 2014, and prior to July 1, 2014,
 20 22 but the applications were not received by the authority, the
 20 23 application forms submitted were approved by the necessary
 20 24 governing bodies and commissions, the authority determines
 20 25 the housing business would otherwise be eligible under the
 20 26 Code section that was repealed, and the city or county and the
 20 27 eligible housing business meet all other requirements of the
 20 28 housing enterprise tax credit program and of the agreement
 20 29 entered into with the economic development authority.

 18 17 of the division amending Code section 423.2, regarding the
 18 18 transfers of sales tax increment revenue to a reinvestment
 18 19 district and to a flood mitigation project account as well as
 18 20 the retention of repayment receipts, apply to transfers of
 18 21 sales tax revenues made on or after July 1, 2015.
 18 22    Division IV of the bill relates to enterprise zones.  The

 18 28    Division V of the bill relates to nuisance properties
 18 29 and abandoned buildings. The division requires the economic
 18 30 development authority to establish a nuisance property
 18 31 remediation fund for the purpose of providing financial
 18 32 assistance to cities for the remediation of nuisance
 18 33 properties, abandoned buildings, and other structures.  The
 18 34 division provides that moneys in a fund established in the high
 18 35 quality jobs program may be deposited in the nuisance property
 19  1 remediation fund.  The division allows the authority to operate
 19  2 the fund as a revolving fund and to use moneys in the fund for
 19  3 purposes of the program, or the authority may transfer the
 19  4 moneys to other funds it has created.  However, the division
 19  5 states that the authority must use any money specifically
 19  6 appropriated for nuisance property remediation assistance for
 19  7 the program.  Moneys in the fund consist of appropriations and
 19  8 any other moneys lawfully available to the authority.  The
 19  9 authority may provide this assistance using a competitive
 19 10 scoring process.  The division requires the authority to enter
 19 11 into an agreement with the city concerning the assistance.  The
 19 12 division allows the authority to grant priority to cities with
 19 13 severe blighted areas, widespread dilapidated housing stock, or
 19 14 high rates of low and moderate income residents.
 19 15    Division V also makes changes to the authority of cities and
 19 16 counties relating to certain abandoned or unsafe buildings.
 19 17 Code chapter 657A allows a city or county to take action
 19 18 to abate by rehabilitation a building used primarily for
 19 19 residential purposes that meets the statutory definition of
 19 20 "abandoned" or "public nuisance", as those terms are defined
 19 21 by the Iowa Code.  The costs associated with rehabilitating
 19 22 the building that remain unpaid by the owner create a mortgage
 19 23 lien against the property.  In lieu of abatement through
 19 24 rehabilitation, Code section 657A.10A allows a city to file
 19 25 an action in district court to take title to an abandoned
 19 26 building.  The court may award title to the petitioning city if
 19 27 the court finds that the building is abandoned, using factors
 19 28 established in statute, or if the city establishes that all
 19 29 interested parties received proper notice and the interested
 19 30 parties either consented to the title transfer or had taken no
 19 31 action to comply with local housing official orders within 60
 19 32 days after the filing of the petition.
 19 33    The division amends the definition of "building" in Code
 19 34 section 657A.1 to include buildings used or intended to be used
 19 35 for commercial or industrial purposes and makes corresponding
 20  1 amendments to refer to the local building code or local housing
 20  2 code, as applicable.
 20  3    Currently, Code section 657A.10A requires that service
 20  4 of notice of the filing of the petition for title be made
 20  5 on interested parties by certified mail and by posting on
 20  6 the building.  The division provides that service shall be
 20  7 by personal service or certified mail or, if service cannot
 20  8 be made by either method, by posting on the building and
 20  9 publication in a newspaper of general circulation in the city.

 18 17 of the division amending Code section 423.2, regarding the
 18 18 transfers of sales tax increment revenue to a reinvestment
 18 19 district and to a flood mitigation project account as well as
 18 20 the retention of repayment receipts, apply to transfers of
 18 21 sales tax revenues made on or after July 1, 2015.
 18 22    Division IV of the bill relates to enterprise zones.  The

 18 24 authority for compliance reasons to amend agreements made under
 18 25 the enterprise zone program as long as the amendments do not
 18 26 increase the amount of incentives awarded and the economic

 18 28    Division V of the bill relates to nuisance properties
 18 29 and abandoned buildings. The division requires the economic
 18 30 development authority to establish a nuisance property
 18 31 remediation fund for the purpose of providing financial
 18 32 assistance to cities for the remediation of nuisance
 18 33 properties, abandoned buildings, and other structures.  The
 18 34 division provides that moneys in a fund established in the high
 18 35 quality jobs program may be deposited in the nuisance property
 19  1 remediation fund.  The division allows the authority to operate
 19  2 the fund as a revolving fund and to use moneys in the fund for
 19  3 purposes of the program, or the authority may transfer the
 19  4 moneys to other funds it has created.  However, the division
 19  5 states that the authority must use any money specifically
 19  6 appropriated for nuisance property remediation assistance for
 19  7 the program.  Moneys in the fund consist of appropriations and
 19  8 any other moneys lawfully available to the authority.  The
 19  9 authority may provide this assistance using a competitive
 19 10 scoring process.  The division requires the authority to enter
 19 11 into an agreement with the city concerning the assistance.  The
 19 12 division allows the authority to grant priority to cities with
 19 13 severe blighted areas, widespread dilapidated housing stock, or
 19 14 high rates of low and moderate income residents.
 19 15    Division V also makes changes to the authority of cities and
 19 16 counties relating to certain abandoned or unsafe buildings.
 19 17 Code chapter 657A allows a city or county to take action
 19 18 to abate by rehabilitation a building used primarily for
 19 19 residential purposes that meets the statutory definition of
 19 20 "abandoned" or "public nuisance", as those terms are defined
 19 21 by the Iowa Code.  The costs associated with rehabilitating
 19 22 the building that remain unpaid by the owner create a mortgage
 19 23 lien against the property.  In lieu of abatement through
 19 24 rehabilitation, Code section 657A.10A allows a city to file
 19 25 an action in district court to take title to an abandoned
 19 26 building.  The court may award title to the petitioning city if
 19 27 the court finds that the building is abandoned, using factors
 19 28 established in statute, or if the city establishes that all
 19 29 interested parties received proper notice and the interested
 19 30 parties either consented to the title transfer or had taken no
 19 31 action to comply with local housing official orders within 60
 19 32 days after the filing of the petition.
 19 33    The division amends the definition of "building" in Code
 19 34 section 657A.1 to include buildings used or intended to be used
 19 35 for commercial or industrial purposes and makes corresponding
 20  1 amendments to refer to the local building code or local housing
 20  2 code, as applicable.
 20  3    Currently, Code section 657A.10A requires that service
 20  4 of notice of the filing of the petition for title be made
 20  5 on interested parties by certified mail and by posting on
 20  6 the building.  The division provides that service shall be
 20  7 by personal service or certified mail or, if service cannot
 20  8 be made by either method, by posting on the building and
 20  9 publication in a newspaper of general circulation in the city.

 20 14 for a housing enterprise tax credit for certain housing
 20 15 businesses that had mailed applications to the authority prior
 20 16 to the July 1, 2014, repeal of the housing enterprise tax
 20 17 credit in Code section 15E.193B.
 20 18    The division states that the authority may enter into
 20 19 an agreement and issue housing enterprise tax credits to a
 20 20 housing business if the city or county mailed the application
 20 21 forms on or after June 1, 2014, and prior to July 1, 2014,

 19 19 residential purposes that meets the statutory definition of
 19 20 "abandoned" or "public nuisance", as those terms are defined
 19 21 by the Iowa Code.  The costs associated with rehabilitating
 19 22 the building that remain unpaid by the owner create a mortgage
 19 23 lien against the property.  In lieu of abatement through
 19 24 rehabilitation, Code section 657A.10A allows a city to file
 19 25 an action in district court to take title to an abandoned
 19 26 building.  The court may award title to the petitioning city if
 19 27 the court finds that the building is abandoned, using factors
 19 28 established in statute, or if the city establishes that all
 19 29 interested parties received proper notice and the interested
 19 30 parties either consented to the title transfer or had taken no
 19 31 action to comply with local housing official orders within 60
 19 32 days after the filing of the petition.

 20  4 of notice of the filing of the petition for title be made
 20  5 on interested parties by certified mail and by posting on
 20  6 the building.  The division provides that service shall be
 20  7 by personal service or certified mail or, if service cannot
 20  8 be made by either method, by posting on the building and
 20  9 publication in a newspaper of general circulation in the city.

 20 15 businesses that had mailed applications to the authority prior
 20 16 to the July 1, 2014, repeal of the housing enterprise tax
 20 17 credit in Code section 15E.193B.
 20 18    The division states that the authority may enter into
 20 19 an agreement and issue housing enterprise tax credits to a
 20 20 housing business if the city or county mailed the application
 20 21 forms on or after June 1, 2014, and prior to July 1, 2014,

 19  1 remediation fund.  The division allows the authority to operate
 19  2 the fund as a revolving fund and to use moneys in the fund for
 19  3 purposes of the program, or the authority may transfer the
 19  4 moneys to other funds it has created.  However, the division
 19  5 states that the authority must use any money specifically
 19  6 appropriated for nuisance property remediation assistance for
 19  7 the program.  Moneys in the fund consist of appropriations and
 19  8 any other moneys lawfully available to the authority.  The
 19  9 authority may provide this assistance using a competitive

 18 18 transfers of sales tax increment revenue to a reinvestment
 18 19 district and to a flood mitigation project account as well as
 18 20 the retention of repayment receipts, apply to transfers of
 18 21 sales tax revenues made on or after July 1, 2015.
 18 22    Division IV of the bill relates to enterprise zones.  The
 18 23 division allows a city or county and the economic development
 18 24 authority for compliance reasons to amend agreements made under
 18 25 the enterprise zone program as long as the amendments do not
 18 26 increase the amount of incentives awarded and the economic
 18 27 development authority board approves.
 18 28    Division V of the bill relates to nuisance properties
 18 29 and abandoned buildings. The division requires the economic
 18 30 development authority to establish a nuisance property
 18 31 remediation fund for the purpose of providing financial
 18 32 assistance to cities for the remediation of nuisance
 18 33 properties, abandoned buildings, and other structures.  The
 18 34 division provides that moneys in a fund established in the high
 18 35 quality jobs program may be deposited in the nuisance property
 19  1 remediation fund.  The division allows the authority to operate
 19  2 the fund as a revolving fund and to use moneys in the fund for
 19  3 purposes of the program, or the authority may transfer the
 19  4 moneys to other funds it has created.  However, the division
 19  5 states that the authority must use any money specifically
 19  6 appropriated for nuisance property remediation assistance for
 19  7 the program.  Moneys in the fund consist of appropriations and
 19  8 any other moneys lawfully available to the authority.  The
 19  9 authority may provide this assistance using a competitive
 19 10 scoring process.  The division requires the authority to enter
 19 11 into an agreement with the city concerning the assistance.  The
 19 12 division allows the authority to grant priority to cities with
 19 13 severe blighted areas, widespread dilapidated housing stock, or
 19 14 high rates of low and moderate income residents.
 19 15    Division V also makes changes to the authority of cities and
 19 16 counties relating to certain abandoned or unsafe buildings.
 19 17 Code chapter 657A allows a city or county to take action
 19 18 to abate by rehabilitation a building used primarily for
 19 19 residential purposes that meets the statutory definition of
 19 20 "abandoned" or "public nuisance", as those terms are defined
 19 21 by the Iowa Code.  The costs associated with rehabilitating
 19 22 the building that remain unpaid by the owner create a mortgage
 19 23 lien against the property.  In lieu of abatement through
 19 24 rehabilitation, Code section 657A.10A allows a city to file
 19 25 an action in district court to take title to an abandoned
 19 26 building.  The court may award title to the petitioning city if
 19 27 the court finds that the building is abandoned, using factors
 19 28 established in statute, or if the city establishes that all
 19 29 interested parties received proper notice and the interested
 19 30 parties either consented to the title transfer or had taken no
 19 31 action to comply with local housing official orders within 60
 19 32 days after the filing of the petition.
 19 33    The division amends the definition of "building" in Code
 19 34 section 657A.1 to include buildings used or intended to be used
 19 35 for commercial or industrial purposes and makes corresponding
 20  1 amendments to refer to the local building code or local housing
 20  2 code, as applicable.
 20  3    Currently, Code section 657A.10A requires that service
 20  4 of notice of the filing of the petition for title be made
 20  5 on interested parties by certified mail and by posting on
 20  6 the building.  The division provides that service shall be
 20  7 by personal service or certified mail or, if service cannot
 20  8 be made by either method, by posting on the building and
 20  9 publication in a newspaper of general circulation in the city.
 20 10    The division also amends Code section 657A.10A to add to the
 20 11 listing of factors for the court to consider when determining
 20 12 whether property has been abandoned.
 20 13    Division VI allows the authority to enter into an agreement
 20 14 for a housing enterprise tax credit for certain housing
 20 15 businesses that had mailed applications to the authority prior
 20 16 to the July 1, 2014, repeal of the housing enterprise tax
 20 17 credit in Code section 15E.193B.
 20 18    The division states that the authority may enter into
 20 19 an agreement and issue housing enterprise tax credits to a
 20 20 housing business if the city or county mailed the application
 20 21 forms on or after June 1, 2014, and prior to July 1, 2014,
 20 22 but the applications were not received by the authority, the
 20 23 application forms submitted were approved by the necessary
 20 24 governing bodies and commissions, the authority determines
 20 25 the housing business would otherwise be eligible under the
 20 26 Code section that was repealed, and the city or county and the
 20 27 eligible housing business meet all other requirements of the
 20 28 housing enterprise tax credit program and of the agreement
 20 29 entered into with the economic development authority.

 19  4 moneys to other funds it has created.  However, the division
 19  5 states that the authority must use any money specifically
 19  6 appropriated for nuisance property remediation assistance for
 19  7 the program.  Moneys in the fund consist of appropriations and
 19  8 any other moneys lawfully available to the authority.  The
 19  9 authority may provide this assistance using a competitive
 19 10 scoring process.  The division requires the authority to enter
 19 11 into an agreement with the city concerning the assistance.  The
 19 12 division allows the authority to grant priority to cities with
 19 13 severe blighted areas, widespread dilapidated housing stock, or

 19 20 "abandoned" or "public nuisance", as those terms are defined
 19 21 by the Iowa Code.  The costs associated with rehabilitating
 19 22 the building that remain unpaid by the owner create a mortgage
 19 23 lien against the property.  In lieu of abatement through
 19 24 rehabilitation, Code section 657A.10A allows a city to file
 19 25 an action in district court to take title to an abandoned
 19 26 building.  The court may award title to the petitioning city if
 19 27 the court finds that the building is abandoned, using factors
 19 28 established in statute, or if the city establishes that all
 19 29 interested parties received proper notice and the interested
 19 30 parties either consented to the title transfer or had taken no
 19 31 action to comply with local housing official orders within 60

 19  4 moneys to other funds it has created.  However, the division
 19  5 states that the authority must use any money specifically

 19 19 residential purposes that meets the statutory definition of
 19 20 "abandoned" or "public nuisance", as those terms are defined
 19 21 by the Iowa Code.  The costs associated with rehabilitating
 19 22 the building that remain unpaid by the owner create a mortgage
 19 23 lien against the property.  In lieu of abatement through
 19 24 rehabilitation, Code section 657A.10A allows a city to file
 19 25 an action in district court to take title to an abandoned
 19 26 building.  The court may award title to the petitioning city if
 19 27 the court finds that the building is abandoned, using factors
 19 28 established in statute, or if the city establishes that all
 19 29 interested parties received proper notice and the interested
 19 30 parties either consented to the title transfer or had taken no
 19 31 action to comply with local housing official orders within 60
 19 32 days after the filing of the petition.

 19 19 residential purposes that meets the statutory definition of
 19 20 "abandoned" or "public nuisance", as those terms are defined
 19 21 by the Iowa Code.  The costs associated with rehabilitating
 19 22 the building that remain unpaid by the owner create a mortgage

 19 25 an action in district court to take title to an abandoned
 19 26 building.  The court may award title to the petitioning city if
 19 27 the court finds that the building is abandoned, using factors
 19 28 established in statute, or if the city establishes that all
 19 29 interested parties received proper notice and the interested
 19 30 parties either consented to the title transfer or had taken no
 19 31 action to comply with local housing official orders within 60
