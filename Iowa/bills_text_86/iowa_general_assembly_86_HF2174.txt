  1  1    Section 1.    1  1    Section 1.    1  2    1.  For purposes of this section, unless the context
  1  3 otherwise requires:
  1  4    a.  "Qualified geothermal heat pump property" means any
  1  5 equipment that uses the ground or groundwater as a thermal
  1  6 energy source to heat the dwelling unit of the taxpayer or as a
  1  7 thermal energy sink to cool such dwelling unit, which equipment
  1  8 meets the requirements of the federal Energy Star program in
  1  9 effect at the time that the expenditure for such equipment is
  1 10 made.
  1 11    b.  "Qualified geothermal heat pump property expenditures"
  1 12 means an expenditure for qualified geothermal heat pump
  1 13 property installed on or in connection with a dwelling unit
  1 14 located in Iowa and used as a residence by the taxpayer.
  1 15    2.  The taxes imposed under this division, less the credits
  1 16 allowed under section 422.12, shall be reduced by a geothermal
  1 17 tax credit equal to twenty=five percent of the qualified
  1 18 geothermal heat pump property expenditures made by the taxpayer
  1 19 during the tax year, not to exceed ten thousand dollars for
  1 20 each separate and distinct geothermal installation.
  1 21    3.  The department shall establish criteria, by rule, for
  1 22 determining what constitutes a separate and distinct geothermal
  1 23 installation.  Qualified geothermal heat pump property
  1 24 expenditures shall be deemed to have been made on the date the
  1 25 installation is complete or, in the case of new construction
  1 26 or reconstruction, the date the original use of the structure
  1 27 by the taxpayer begins.
  1 28    4.  In the case of a taxpayer whose dwelling unit is part
  1 29 of a multiple housing cooperative organized under chapter
  1 30 499A or a horizontal property regime under chapter 499B,
  1 31 the taxpayer shall be treated as having made the taxpayer's
  1 32 proportionate share of any qualified geothermal heat pump
  1 33 property expenditures made by the cooperative or the regime.
  1 34    5.  The tax credit shall be claimed by way of a tax credit
  1 35 certificate issued by the department and included with the
  2  1 taxpayer's tax return.  To receive a tax credit, a taxpayer
  2  2 must submit an application to the department.  The department
  2  3 shall issue certificates under this section on a first=come,
  2  4 first=served basis, which certificates may be claimed for tax
  2  5 credits.
  2  6    6.  The cumulative value of tax credits claimed annually
  2  7 by applicants pursuant to this section shall not exceed two
  2  8 million five hundred thousand dollars.  If in a calendar year
  2  9 the aggregate amount of tax credits applied for exceeds two
  2 10 million five hundred thousand dollars, the department shall
  2 11 establish a wait list for tax credits. Applications that were
  2 12 approved but for which certificates were not issued shall be
  2 13 placed on the wait list in the order the applications were
  2 14 received and those applicants shall be given priority for
  2 15 receiving certificates in succeeding calendar years. Placement
  2 16 on a wait list pursuant to this subsection shall not constitute
  2 17 a promise binding the state. The availability of a tax credit
  2 18 and issuance of a tax credit certificate pursuant to this
  2 19 section in a future calendar year is contingent upon the
  2 20 availability of tax credits in that particular calendar year.
  2 21    7.  Any credit in excess of the tax liability is not
  2 22 refundable but the excess for the tax year may be credited
  2 23 to the tax liability for the following ten years or until
  2 24 depleted, whichever is earlier.
  2 25    8.  A tax  credit shall not be transferable to any other
  2 26 person.
  2 27    9.  A taxpayer who is eligible to claim a credit under this
  2 28 section may also claim the geothermal heat pump tax credit
  2 29 under section 422.11I, if available, on the same expenditures.
  2 30    Sec. 2.  EFFECTIVE DATE.  This Act takes effect January 1,
  2 31 2017.
  2 32    Sec. 3.  APPLICABILITY.  This Act applies to qualified
  2 33 geothermal heat pump property expenditures incurred on or after
  2 34 January 1, 2017.
  2 35                           EXPLANATION
  3  1 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  3  2 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  3  3    This bill creates a geothermal tax credit available
  3  4 against the individual income tax equal to 25 percent of the
  3  5 expenditures for qualified geothermal heat pump property
  3  6 installed on or in connection with a dwelling unit located in
  3  7 Iowa and used as a residence by the taxpayer, not to exceed
  3  8 $10,000 for each separate and distinct geothermal installation.
  3  9 The bill requires the department of revenue (department) to
  3 10 adopt rules for what constitutes a separate and distinct
  3 11 geothermal installation.  "Qualified geothermal heat pump
  3 12 property" and other related terms are defined in the bill.
  3 13 For purposes of the tax credit, expenditures are deemed to be
  3 14 made on the date the installation is complete or, in the case
  3 15 of new construction or reconstruction, the date the original
  3 16 use of the structure begins.  If the taxpayer's dwelling
  3 17 unit is part of a multiple housing cooperative (Code chapter
  3 18 499A) or a horizontal property regime (Code chapter 499B) the
  3 19 taxpayer is treated as having made a proportionate share of any
  3 20 expenditures made by the cooperative or regime.
  3 21    In order to receive a tax credit, the taxpayer submits
  3 22 an application to the department and the department issues
  3 23 the taxpayer a tax credit certificate.  No more than $2.5
  3 24 million in geothermal tax credits may be claimed per year.
  3 25 If the applications for tax credits exceed that amount, the
  3 26 department is required to establish a wait list in the order
  3 27 the applications were received and those applicants will
  3 28 receive priority for receiving tax credits in succeeding years.
  3 29 The tax credit is nontransferable and nonrefundable, but any
  3 30 amount in excess of the taxpayer's tax liability may be carried
  3 31 forward for up to 10 years.
  3 32    A taxpayer who claims the geothermal tax credit is also
  3 33 eligible to claim the geothermal heat pump tax credit under
  3 34 Code section 422.11I, if available, on the same expenditures.
  3 35 Code section 422.11I currently provides a tax credit equal
  4  1 to 20 percent of the federal residential energy efficiency
  4  2 property tax credit for geothermal heat pumps, but that federal
  4  3 credit is scheduled to expire after the 2016 tax year.
  4  4    The bill takes effect January 1, 2017, and applies to
  4  5 qualified geothermal heat pump property expenditures incurred
  4  6 on or after that date.

  1 25 installation is complete or, in the case of new construction
  1 26 or reconstruction, the date the original use of the structure
  1 27 by the taxpayer begins.
  1 28    4.  In the case of a taxpayer whose dwelling unit is part
  1 29 of a multiple housing cooperative organized under chapter
  1 30 499A or a horizontal property regime under chapter 499B,
  1 31 the taxpayer shall be treated as having made the taxpayer's

  2  5 credits.
  2  6    6.  The cumulative value of tax credits claimed annually
  2  7 by applicants pursuant to this section shall not exceed two
  2  8 million five hundred thousand dollars.  If in a calendar year
  2  9 the aggregate amount of tax credits applied for exceeds two
  2 10 million five hundred thousand dollars, the department shall
  2 11 establish a wait list for tax credits. Applications that were
  2 12 approved but for which certificates were not issued shall be
  2 13 placed on the wait list in the order the applications were
  2 14 received and those applicants shall be given priority for
  2 15 receiving certificates in succeeding calendar years. Placement
  2 16 on a wait list pursuant to this subsection shall not constitute

  2 18 and issuance of a tax credit certificate pursuant to this
  2 19 section in a future calendar year is contingent upon the

  2 23 to the tax liability for the following ten years or until
  2 24 depleted, whichever is earlier.

  3  1 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  3  2 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  3  3    This bill creates a geothermal tax credit available
  3  4 against the individual income tax equal to 25 percent of the
  3  5 expenditures for qualified geothermal heat pump property
  3  6 installed on or in connection with a dwelling unit located in
  3  7 Iowa and used as a residence by the taxpayer, not to exceed
  3  8 $10,000 for each separate and distinct geothermal installation.
  3  9 The bill requires the department of revenue (department) to
  3 10 adopt rules for what constitutes a separate and distinct
  3 11 geothermal installation.  "Qualified geothermal heat pump
  3 12 property" and other related terms are defined in the bill.
  3 13 For purposes of the tax credit, expenditures are deemed to be
  3 14 made on the date the installation is complete or, in the case
  3 15 of new construction or reconstruction, the date the original
  3 16 use of the structure begins.  If the taxpayer's dwelling
  3 17 unit is part of a multiple housing cooperative (Code chapter
  3 18 499A) or a horizontal property regime (Code chapter 499B) the
  3 19 taxpayer is treated as having made a proportionate share of any
  3 20 expenditures made by the cooperative or regime.
  3 21    In order to receive a tax credit, the taxpayer submits
  3 22 an application to the department and the department issues
  3 23 the taxpayer a tax credit certificate.  No more than $2.5
  3 24 million in geothermal tax credits may be claimed per year.
  3 25 If the applications for tax credits exceed that amount, the
  3 26 department is required to establish a wait list in the order
  3 27 the applications were received and those applicants will
  3 28 receive priority for receiving tax credits in succeeding years.
  3 29 The tax credit is nontransferable and nonrefundable, but any
  3 30 amount in excess of the taxpayer's tax liability may be carried
  3 31 forward for up to 10 years.
  3 32    A taxpayer who claims the geothermal tax credit is also
  3 33 eligible to claim the geothermal heat pump tax credit under
  3 34 Code section 422.11I, if available, on the same expenditures.
  3 35 Code section 422.11I currently provides a tax credit equal
  4  1 to 20 percent of the federal residential energy efficiency
  4  2 property tax credit for geothermal heat pumps, but that federal
  4  3 credit is scheduled to expire after the 2016 tax year.
  4  4    The bill takes effect January 1, 2017, and applies to

  3  2 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  3  3    This bill creates a geothermal tax credit available
  3  4 against the individual income tax equal to 25 percent of the
  3  5 expenditures for qualified geothermal heat pump property
  3  6 installed on or in connection with a dwelling unit located in
  3  7 Iowa and used as a residence by the taxpayer, not to exceed
  3  8 $10,000 for each separate and distinct geothermal installation.
  3  9 The bill requires the department of revenue (department) to
  3 10 adopt rules for what constitutes a separate and distinct
  3 11 geothermal installation.  "Qualified geothermal heat pump
  3 12 property" and other related terms are defined in the bill.
  3 13 For purposes of the tax credit, expenditures are deemed to be
  3 14 made on the date the installation is complete or, in the case
  3 15 of new construction or reconstruction, the date the original
  3 16 use of the structure begins.  If the taxpayer's dwelling
  3 17 unit is part of a multiple housing cooperative (Code chapter
  3 18 499A) or a horizontal property regime (Code chapter 499B) the
  3 19 taxpayer is treated as having made a proportionate share of any
  3 20 expenditures made by the cooperative or regime.
  3 21    In order to receive a tax credit, the taxpayer submits
  3 22 an application to the department and the department issues
  3 23 the taxpayer a tax credit certificate.  No more than $2.5
  3 24 million in geothermal tax credits may be claimed per year.
  3 25 If the applications for tax credits exceed that amount, the
  3 26 department is required to establish a wait list in the order
  3 27 the applications were received and those applicants will
  3 28 receive priority for receiving tax credits in succeeding years.
  3 29 The tax credit is nontransferable and nonrefundable, but any
  3 30 amount in excess of the taxpayer's tax liability may be carried
  3 31 forward for up to 10 years.
  3 32    A taxpayer who claims the geothermal tax credit is also
  3 33 eligible to claim the geothermal heat pump tax credit under
  3 34 Code section 422.11I, if available, on the same expenditures.
  3 35 Code section 422.11I currently provides a tax credit equal
  4  1 to 20 percent of the federal residential energy efficiency
  4  2 property tax credit for geothermal heat pumps, but that federal

  3  1 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  3  2 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  3  3    This bill creates a geothermal tax credit available
  3  4 against the individual income tax equal to 25 percent of the
  3  5 expenditures for qualified geothermal heat pump property
  3  6 installed on or in connection with a dwelling unit located in
  3  7 Iowa and used as a residence by the taxpayer, not to exceed
  3  8 $10,000 for each separate and distinct geothermal installation.
  3  9 The bill requires the department of revenue (department) to
  3 10 adopt rules for what constitutes a separate and distinct
  3 11 geothermal installation.  "Qualified geothermal heat pump
  3 12 property" and other related terms are defined in the bill.
  3 13 For purposes of the tax credit, expenditures are deemed to be
  3 14 made on the date the installation is complete or, in the case
  3 15 of new construction or reconstruction, the date the original
  3 16 use of the structure begins.  If the taxpayer's dwelling
  3 17 unit is part of a multiple housing cooperative (Code chapter
  3 18 499A) or a horizontal property regime (Code chapter 499B) the
  3 19 taxpayer is treated as having made a proportionate share of any
  3 20 expenditures made by the cooperative or regime.
  3 21    In order to receive a tax credit, the taxpayer submits
  3 22 an application to the department and the department issues
  3 23 the taxpayer a tax credit certificate.  No more than $2.5
  3 24 million in geothermal tax credits may be claimed per year.
  3 25 If the applications for tax credits exceed that amount, the
  3 26 department is required to establish a wait list in the order
  3 27 the applications were received and those applicants will
  3 28 receive priority for receiving tax credits in succeeding years.
  3 29 The tax credit is nontransferable and nonrefundable, but any
  3 30 amount in excess of the taxpayer's tax liability may be carried
  3 31 forward for up to 10 years.
  3 32    A taxpayer who claims the geothermal tax credit is also
  3 33 eligible to claim the geothermal heat pump tax credit under
  3 34 Code section 422.11I, if available, on the same expenditures.
  3 35 Code section 422.11I currently provides a tax credit equal
  4  1 to 20 percent of the federal residential energy efficiency
  4  2 property tax credit for geothermal heat pumps, but that federal
  4  3 credit is scheduled to expire after the 2016 tax year.

  2 35                           EXPLANATION
  3  1 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  3  2 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  3  3    This bill creates a geothermal tax credit available
  3  4 against the individual income tax equal to 25 percent of the
  3  5 expenditures for qualified geothermal heat pump property
  3  6 installed on or in connection with a dwelling unit located in
  3  7 Iowa and used as a residence by the taxpayer, not to exceed
  3  8 $10,000 for each separate and distinct geothermal installation.
  3  9 The bill requires the department of revenue (department) to
  3 10 adopt rules for what constitutes a separate and distinct
  3 11 geothermal installation.  "Qualified geothermal heat pump
  3 12 property" and other related terms are defined in the bill.
  3 13 For purposes of the tax credit, expenditures are deemed to be
  3 14 made on the date the installation is complete or, in the case
  3 15 of new construction or reconstruction, the date the original
  3 16 use of the structure begins.  If the taxpayer's dwelling
  3 17 unit is part of a multiple housing cooperative (Code chapter
  3 18 499A) or a horizontal property regime (Code chapter 499B) the
  3 19 taxpayer is treated as having made a proportionate share of any
  3 20 expenditures made by the cooperative or regime.
  3 21    In order to receive a tax credit, the taxpayer submits
  3 22 an application to the department and the department issues
  3 23 the taxpayer a tax credit certificate.  No more than $2.5
  3 24 million in geothermal tax credits may be claimed per year.
  3 25 If the applications for tax credits exceed that amount, the
  3 26 department is required to establish a wait list in the order
  3 27 the applications were received and those applicants will
  3 28 receive priority for receiving tax credits in succeeding years.
  3 29 The tax credit is nontransferable and nonrefundable, but any
  3 30 amount in excess of the taxpayer's tax liability may be carried
  3 31 forward for up to 10 years.
  3 32    A taxpayer who claims the geothermal tax credit is also
  3 33 eligible to claim the geothermal heat pump tax credit under
  3 34 Code section 422.11I, if available, on the same expenditures.
  3 35 Code section 422.11I currently provides a tax credit equal
  4  1 to 20 percent of the federal residential energy efficiency
  4  2 property tax credit for geothermal heat pumps, but that federal
  4  3 credit is scheduled to expire after the 2016 tax year.
  4  4    The bill takes effect January 1, 2017, and applies to

  1 18 geothermal heat pump property expenditures made by the taxpayer
  1 19 during the tax year, not to exceed ten thousand dollars for
  1 20 each separate and distinct geothermal installation.
  1 21    3.  The department shall establish criteria, by rule, for
  1 22 determining what constitutes a separate and distinct geothermal
  1 23 installation.  Qualified geothermal heat pump property
  1 24 expenditures shall be deemed to have been made on the date the
  1 25 installation is complete or, in the case of new construction
  1 26 or reconstruction, the date the original use of the structure
  1 27 by the taxpayer begins.
  1 28    4.  In the case of a taxpayer whose dwelling unit is part
  1 29 of a multiple housing cooperative organized under chapter
  1 30 499A or a horizontal property regime under chapter 499B,
  1 31 the taxpayer shall be treated as having made the taxpayer's
  1 32 proportionate share of any qualified geothermal heat pump
  1 33 property expenditures made by the cooperative or the regime.
  1 34    5.  The tax credit shall be claimed by way of a tax credit
  1 35 certificate issued by the department and included with the
  2  1 taxpayer's tax return.  To receive a tax credit, a taxpayer
  2  2 must submit an application to the department.  The department
  2  3 shall issue certificates under this section on a first=come,
  2  4 first=served basis, which certificates may be claimed for tax
  2  5 credits.
  2  6    6.  The cumulative value of tax credits claimed annually
  2  7 by applicants pursuant to this section shall not exceed two
  2  8 million five hundred thousand dollars.  If in a calendar year
  2  9 the aggregate amount of tax credits applied for exceeds two
  2 10 million five hundred thousand dollars, the department shall
  2 11 establish a wait list for tax credits. Applications that were
  2 12 approved but for which certificates were not issued shall be
  2 13 placed on the wait list in the order the applications were
  2 14 received and those applicants shall be given priority for

  3  1 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  3  2 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  3  3    This bill creates a geothermal tax credit available
  3  4 against the individual income tax equal to 25 percent of the
  3  5 expenditures for qualified geothermal heat pump property
  3  6 installed on or in connection with a dwelling unit located in
  3  7 Iowa and used as a residence by the taxpayer, not to exceed
  3  8 $10,000 for each separate and distinct geothermal installation.
  3  9 The bill requires the department of revenue (department) to
  3 10 adopt rules for what constitutes a separate and distinct
  3 11 geothermal installation.  "Qualified geothermal heat pump
  3 12 property" and other related terms are defined in the bill.
  3 13 For purposes of the tax credit, expenditures are deemed to be
  3 14 made on the date the installation is complete or, in the case
  3 15 of new construction or reconstruction, the date the original
  3 16 use of the structure begins.  If the taxpayer's dwelling
  3 17 unit is part of a multiple housing cooperative (Code chapter
  3 18 499A) or a horizontal property regime (Code chapter 499B) the
  3 19 taxpayer is treated as having made a proportionate share of any
  3 20 expenditures made by the cooperative or regime.
  3 21    In order to receive a tax credit, the taxpayer submits
  3 22 an application to the department and the department issues
  3 23 the taxpayer a tax credit certificate.  No more than $2.5
  3 24 million in geothermal tax credits may be claimed per year.
  3 25 If the applications for tax credits exceed that amount, the
  3 26 department is required to establish a wait list in the order
  3 27 the applications were received and those applicants will
  3 28 receive priority for receiving tax credits in succeeding years.
  3 29 The tax credit is nontransferable and nonrefundable, but any
  3 30 amount in excess of the taxpayer's tax liability may be carried
  3 31 forward for up to 10 years.
  3 32    A taxpayer who claims the geothermal tax credit is also
  3 33 eligible to claim the geothermal heat pump tax credit under
  3 34 Code section 422.11I, if available, on the same expenditures.
  3 35 Code section 422.11I currently provides a tax credit equal
  4  1 to 20 percent of the federal residential energy efficiency
  4  2 property tax credit for geothermal heat pumps, but that federal
  4  3 credit is scheduled to expire after the 2016 tax year.
  4  4    The bill takes effect January 1, 2017, and applies to

  3  1 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  3  2 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  3  3    This bill creates a geothermal tax credit available
  3  4 against the individual income tax equal to 25 percent of the
  3  5 expenditures for qualified geothermal heat pump property
  3  6 installed on or in connection with a dwelling unit located in
  3  7 Iowa and used as a residence by the taxpayer, not to exceed
  3  8 $10,000 for each separate and distinct geothermal installation.
  3  9 The bill requires the department of revenue (department) to
  3 10 adopt rules for what constitutes a separate and distinct
  3 11 geothermal installation.  "Qualified geothermal heat pump
  3 12 property" and other related terms are defined in the bill.
  3 13 For purposes of the tax credit, expenditures are deemed to be
  3 14 made on the date the installation is complete or, in the case
  3 15 of new construction or reconstruction, the date the original
  3 16 use of the structure begins.  If the taxpayer's dwelling
  3 17 unit is part of a multiple housing cooperative (Code chapter
  3 18 499A) or a horizontal property regime (Code chapter 499B) the
  3 19 taxpayer is treated as having made a proportionate share of any
  3 20 expenditures made by the cooperative or regime.
  3 21    In order to receive a tax credit, the taxpayer submits
  3 22 an application to the department and the department issues
  3 23 the taxpayer a tax credit certificate.  No more than $2.5
  3 24 million in geothermal tax credits may be claimed per year.
  3 25 If the applications for tax credits exceed that amount, the
  3 26 department is required to establish a wait list in the order
  3 27 the applications were received and those applicants will
  3 28 receive priority for receiving tax credits in succeeding years.
  3 29 The tax credit is nontransferable and nonrefundable, but any
  3 30 amount in excess of the taxpayer's tax liability may be carried
  3 31 forward for up to 10 years.
  3 32    A taxpayer who claims the geothermal tax credit is also
  3 33 eligible to claim the geothermal heat pump tax credit under
  3 34 Code section 422.11I, if available, on the same expenditures.
  3 35 Code section 422.11I currently provides a tax credit equal
  4  1 to 20 percent of the federal residential energy efficiency
  4  2 property tax credit for geothermal heat pumps, but that federal
  4  3 credit is scheduled to expire after the 2016 tax year.
  4  4    The bill takes effect January 1, 2017, and applies to

  3  1 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  3  2 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  3  3    This bill creates a geothermal tax credit available
  3  4 against the individual income tax equal to 25 percent of the
  3  5 expenditures for qualified geothermal heat pump property
  3  6 installed on or in connection with a dwelling unit located in
  3  7 Iowa and used as a residence by the taxpayer, not to exceed
  3  8 $10,000 for each separate and distinct geothermal installation.
  3  9 The bill requires the department of revenue (department) to
  3 10 adopt rules for what constitutes a separate and distinct
  3 11 geothermal installation.  "Qualified geothermal heat pump
  3 12 property" and other related terms are defined in the bill.
  3 13 For purposes of the tax credit, expenditures are deemed to be
  3 14 made on the date the installation is complete or, in the case
  3 15 of new construction or reconstruction, the date the original
  3 16 use of the structure begins.  If the taxpayer's dwelling
  3 17 unit is part of a multiple housing cooperative (Code chapter
  3 18 499A) or a horizontal property regime (Code chapter 499B) the
  3 19 taxpayer is treated as having made a proportionate share of any
  3 20 expenditures made by the cooperative or regime.
  3 21    In order to receive a tax credit, the taxpayer submits
  3 22 an application to the department and the department issues
  3 23 the taxpayer a tax credit certificate.  No more than $2.5
  3 24 million in geothermal tax credits may be claimed per year.
  3 25 If the applications for tax credits exceed that amount, the
  3 26 department is required to establish a wait list in the order
  3 27 the applications were received and those applicants will
  3 28 receive priority for receiving tax credits in succeeding years.
  3 29 The tax credit is nontransferable and nonrefundable, but any
  3 30 amount in excess of the taxpayer's tax liability may be carried
  3 31 forward for up to 10 years.
  3 32    A taxpayer who claims the geothermal tax credit is also
  3 33 eligible to claim the geothermal heat pump tax credit under
  3 34 Code section 422.11I, if available, on the same expenditures.
  3 35 Code section 422.11I currently provides a tax credit equal
  4  1 to 20 percent of the federal residential energy efficiency
  4  2 property tax credit for geothermal heat pumps, but that federal
  4  3 credit is scheduled to expire after the 2016 tax year.

  3  9 The bill requires the department of revenue (department) to
  3 10 adopt rules for what constitutes a separate and distinct
  3 11 geothermal installation.  "Qualified geothermal heat pump
  3 12 property" and other related terms are defined in the bill.
  3 13 For purposes of the tax credit, expenditures are deemed to be
  3 14 made on the date the installation is complete or, in the case
  3 15 of new construction or reconstruction, the date the original
  3 16 use of the structure begins.  If the taxpayer's dwelling
  3 17 unit is part of a multiple housing cooperative (Code chapter
  3 18 499A) or a horizontal property regime (Code chapter 499B) the
  3 19 taxpayer is treated as having made a proportionate share of any
  3 20 expenditures made by the cooperative or regime.
  3 21    In order to receive a tax credit, the taxpayer submits
  3 22 an application to the department and the department issues
  3 23 the taxpayer a tax credit certificate.  No more than $2.5
  3 24 million in geothermal tax credits may be claimed per year.
  3 25 If the applications for tax credits exceed that amount, the
  3 26 department is required to establish a wait list in the order
  3 27 the applications were received and those applicants will
  3 28 receive priority for receiving tax credits in succeeding years.
  3 29 The tax credit is nontransferable and nonrefundable, but any
  3 30 amount in excess of the taxpayer's tax liability may be carried
  3 31 forward for up to 10 years.
  3 32    A taxpayer who claims the geothermal tax credit is also
  3 33 eligible to claim the geothermal heat pump tax credit under
  3 34 Code section 422.11I, if available, on the same expenditures.
  3 35 Code section 422.11I currently provides a tax credit equal

  3  1 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  3  2 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  3  3    This bill creates a geothermal tax credit available
  3  4 against the individual income tax equal to 25 percent of the
  3  5 expenditures for qualified geothermal heat pump property
  3  6 installed on or in connection with a dwelling unit located in
  3  7 Iowa and used as a residence by the taxpayer, not to exceed
  3  8 $10,000 for each separate and distinct geothermal installation.
  3  9 The bill requires the department of revenue (department) to
  3 10 adopt rules for what constitutes a separate and distinct
  3 11 geothermal installation.  "Qualified geothermal heat pump
  3 12 property" and other related terms are defined in the bill.
  3 13 For purposes of the tax credit, expenditures are deemed to be
  3 14 made on the date the installation is complete or, in the case
  3 15 of new construction or reconstruction, the date the original
  3 16 use of the structure begins.  If the taxpayer's dwelling
  3 17 unit is part of a multiple housing cooperative (Code chapter
  3 18 499A) or a horizontal property regime (Code chapter 499B) the
  3 19 taxpayer is treated as having made a proportionate share of any
  3 20 expenditures made by the cooperative or regime.
  3 21    In order to receive a tax credit, the taxpayer submits
  3 22 an application to the department and the department issues
  3 23 the taxpayer a tax credit certificate.  No more than $2.5
  3 24 million in geothermal tax credits may be claimed per year.
  3 25 If the applications for tax credits exceed that amount, the
  3 26 department is required to establish a wait list in the order
  3 27 the applications were received and those applicants will
  3 28 receive priority for receiving tax credits in succeeding years.
  3 29 The tax credit is nontransferable and nonrefundable, but any
  3 30 amount in excess of the taxpayer's tax liability may be carried
  3 31 forward for up to 10 years.
  3 32    A taxpayer who claims the geothermal tax credit is also

  3  1 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  3  2 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  3  3    This bill creates a geothermal tax credit available
  3  4 against the individual income tax equal to 25 percent of the
  3  5 expenditures for qualified geothermal heat pump property
  3  6 installed on or in connection with a dwelling unit located in
  3  7 Iowa and used as a residence by the taxpayer, not to exceed
  3  8 $10,000 for each separate and distinct geothermal installation.
  3  9 The bill requires the department of revenue (department) to
  3 10 adopt rules for what constitutes a separate and distinct
  3 11 geothermal installation.  "Qualified geothermal heat pump
  3 12 property" and other related terms are defined in the bill.
  3 13 For purposes of the tax credit, expenditures are deemed to be
  3 14 made on the date the installation is complete or, in the case
  3 15 of new construction or reconstruction, the date the original
  3 16 use of the structure begins.  If the taxpayer's dwelling
  3 17 unit is part of a multiple housing cooperative (Code chapter
  3 18 499A) or a horizontal property regime (Code chapter 499B) the
  3 19 taxpayer is treated as having made a proportionate share of any
  3 20 expenditures made by the cooperative or regime.
  3 21    In order to receive a tax credit, the taxpayer submits
  3 22 an application to the department and the department issues
  3 23 the taxpayer a tax credit certificate.  No more than $2.5
  3 24 million in geothermal tax credits may be claimed per year.
  3 25 If the applications for tax credits exceed that amount, the
  3 26 department is required to establish a wait list in the order
  3 27 the applications were received and those applicants will
  3 28 receive priority for receiving tax credits in succeeding years.
  3 29 The tax credit is nontransferable and nonrefundable, but any
  3 30 amount in excess of the taxpayer's tax liability may be carried
  3 31 forward for up to 10 years.
  3 32    A taxpayer who claims the geothermal tax credit is also
  3 33 eligible to claim the geothermal heat pump tax credit under

  3  4 against the individual income tax equal to 25 percent of the
  3  5 expenditures for qualified geothermal heat pump property
  3  6 installed on or in connection with a dwelling unit located in
  3  7 Iowa and used as a residence by the taxpayer, not to exceed
  3  8 $10,000 for each separate and distinct geothermal installation.
  3  9 The bill requires the department of revenue (department) to
  3 10 adopt rules for what constitutes a separate and distinct
  3 11 geothermal installation.  "Qualified geothermal heat pump
  3 12 property" and other related terms are defined in the bill.
  3 13 For purposes of the tax credit, expenditures are deemed to be
  3 14 made on the date the installation is complete or, in the case
  3 15 of new construction or reconstruction, the date the original
  3 16 use of the structure begins.  If the taxpayer's dwelling
  3 17 unit is part of a multiple housing cooperative (Code chapter
  3 18 499A) or a horizontal property regime (Code chapter 499B) the
  3 19 taxpayer is treated as having made a proportionate share of any
  3 20 expenditures made by the cooperative or regime.
  3 21    In order to receive a tax credit, the taxpayer submits
  3 22 an application to the department and the department issues
  3 23 the taxpayer a tax credit certificate.  No more than $2.5
  3 24 million in geothermal tax credits may be claimed per year.
  3 25 If the applications for tax credits exceed that amount, the
  3 26 department is required to establish a wait list in the order
  3 27 the applications were received and those applicants will
  3 28 receive priority for receiving tax credits in succeeding years.
  3 29 The tax credit is nontransferable and nonrefundable, but any
  3 30 amount in excess of the taxpayer's tax liability may be carried
  3 31 forward for up to 10 years.
  3 32    A taxpayer who claims the geothermal tax credit is also
  3 33 eligible to claim the geothermal heat pump tax credit under
  3 34 Code section 422.11I, if available, on the same expenditures.
  3 35 Code section 422.11I currently provides a tax credit equal
  4  1 to 20 percent of the federal residential energy efficiency
  4  2 property tax credit for geothermal heat pumps, but that federal
  4  3 credit is scheduled to expire after the 2016 tax year.
  4  4    The bill takes effect January 1, 2017, and applies to
  4  5 qualified geothermal heat pump property expenditures incurred
  4  6 on or after that date.
