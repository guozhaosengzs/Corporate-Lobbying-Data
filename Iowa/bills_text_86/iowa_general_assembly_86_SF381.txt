  3 31 seasons, areas, and limits; authorize the issuance of free
  3 32 licenses; allow hunting with a firearm from a motor vehicle
  3 33 by designated persons; require hunters to provide physical
  3 34 samples from harvested wildlife for disease testing; limit the
  3 35 possession, transportation, and disposition of wildlife; and
  4  1 restrict wildlife feeding.
  4  2    The commission is also required to develop, by rule,
  4  3 procedures for designating an area of the state as a disease
  4  4 management zone including developing an action plan. The
  4  5 department of natural resources is required to hold a public
  4  6 hearing and solicit public comment on a proposed disease
