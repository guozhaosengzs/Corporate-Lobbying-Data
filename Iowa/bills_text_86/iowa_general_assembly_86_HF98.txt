  1  6 responsible for the care of the child, shall provide that
  1  7 person with written notice of all of the following:
  1  8    (a)  The person responsible for the care of the child is
  1  9 not required to permit the child protection worker to enter

  1 11 child. However, if permission is refused, the juvenile court

  1 13 enter the home to interview or observe the child upon a showing
  1 14 of probable cause.
  1 15    (b)  The person responsible for the care of the child is not

  1 24 administrative or court proceeding.
  1 25    (e)  The child protection worker is not an attorney and
  1 26 cannot provide legal advice to the person responsible for the

  1 29 required to sign any document presented by the child protection
  1 30 worker including but not limited to a release of claims or a
  1 31 service agreement, and is entitled to have an attorney review
  1 32 such document before agreeing to sign the document.
  1 33    (g)  A failure of the person responsible for the care of the

  2 21    b.  Notwithstanding paragraph "a", if an initial contact
  2 22 with the person responsible for the care of the child occurs
  2 23 telephonically, the department shall orally provide that person
  2 24 with notice of that person's rights as described in paragraph

  2 29 face=to=face contact with the person responsible for the care
  2 30 of the child.
  2 31    c.  The department shall make reasonable efforts to ensure

  3 17 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  3 18 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  3 19    This bill adds a notice of rights requirement to department
  3 20 of human services (DHS) child abuse investigations.  The bill
  3 21 requires a DHS child protection worker to provide written
  3 22 notice to a person responsible for the care of the child when
  3 23 DHS conducts an initial face=to=face contact with that person.
  3 24 "Person responsible for the care of the child" is defined as
  3 25 a parent, guardian, foster parent, or relative or any other
  3 26 person with whom the child resides and who assumes care or
  3 27 supervision of the child.
  3 28    The bill also requires DHS to provide oral notice to a person
  3 29 responsible for the care of the child when DHS conducts an
  3 30 initial contact telephonically.  If a DHS child protection
  3 31 worker has face=to=face contact with the person responsible for
  3 32 the care of the child after an initial telephone contact, the
  3 33 DHS worker must provide written notice at the first initial
  3 34 face=to=face contact as well.
  3 35    The notice must provide that the person responsible for
  4  1 the care of the child is not required to allow the DHS child
  4  2 protection worker into the residence, is not required to
  4  3 speak to the DHS child protection worker, is entitled to seek
  4  4 representation of an attorney, and is not required to sign any
  4  5 document presented by the DHS child protection worker.  The
  4  6 notice must also provide that any statement made by the person
  4  7 responsible for the care of the child or other family member
  4  8 may be used against the person, that the DHS child protection
  4  9 worker is not an attorney and cannot provide legal advice,
  4 10 and that the person's failure to communicate with the child
  4 11 protection worker may have serious consequences.
  4 12    The bill requires DHS to make reasonable efforts to provide
  4 13 the notice in a manner which the person responsible for the
  4 14 care of the child can understand.  The written notice for
  4 15 face=to=face contacts must be signed and dated.
  4 16    The bill provides that any statement made by the person
  4 17 responsible for the care of the child, or by a child who
  4 18 is a family member of that person, is inadmissible in any
  4 19 administrative or court proceeding prior to the provision
  4 20 of the written notice.  Additionally, any statement made
  4 21 by the person responsible for the care of the child is
  4 22 inadmissible in any administrative or court proceeding prior to
  4 23 provision of oral notice when an initial contact was conducted
  4 24 telephonically.

  3 12    e.  For purposes of this subsection only, "person responsible

  3 15 paragraphs "a" and "b".
  3 16                           EXPLANATION
  3 17 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  3 18 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  3 19    This bill adds a notice of rights requirement to department
  3 20 of human services (DHS) child abuse investigations.  The bill
  3 21 requires a DHS child protection worker to provide written
  3 22 notice to a person responsible for the care of the child when
  3 23 DHS conducts an initial face=to=face contact with that person.
  3 24 "Person responsible for the care of the child" is defined as
  3 25 a parent, guardian, foster parent, or relative or any other
  3 26 person with whom the child resides and who assumes care or
  3 27 supervision of the child.
  3 28    The bill also requires DHS to provide oral notice to a person
  3 29 responsible for the care of the child when DHS conducts an
  3 30 initial contact telephonically.  If a DHS child protection
  3 31 worker has face=to=face contact with the person responsible for
  3 32 the care of the child after an initial telephone contact, the
  3 33 DHS worker must provide written notice at the first initial
  3 34 face=to=face contact as well.
  3 35    The notice must provide that the person responsible for
  4  1 the care of the child is not required to allow the DHS child
  4  2 protection worker into the residence, is not required to
  4  3 speak to the DHS child protection worker, is entitled to seek
  4  4 representation of an attorney, and is not required to sign any
  4  5 document presented by the DHS child protection worker.  The
  4  6 notice must also provide that any statement made by the person
  4  7 responsible for the care of the child or other family member
  4  8 may be used against the person, that the DHS child protection
  4  9 worker is not an attorney and cannot provide legal advice,
  4 10 and that the person's failure to communicate with the child
  4 11 protection worker may have serious consequences.
  4 12    The bill requires DHS to make reasonable efforts to provide
  4 13 the notice in a manner which the person responsible for the
  4 14 care of the child can understand.  The written notice for
  4 15 face=to=face contacts must be signed and dated.
  4 16    The bill provides that any statement made by the person
  4 17 responsible for the care of the child, or by a child who
  4 18 is a family member of that person, is inadmissible in any
  4 19 administrative or court proceeding prior to the provision
  4 20 of the written notice.  Additionally, any statement made
  4 21 by the person responsible for the care of the child is
  4 22 inadmissible in any administrative or court proceeding prior to
  4 23 provision of oral notice when an initial contact was conducted
  4 24 telephonically.

  3 17 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  3 18 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  3 19    This bill adds a notice of rights requirement to department
  3 20 of human services (DHS) child abuse investigations.  The bill
  3 21 requires a DHS child protection worker to provide written
  3 22 notice to a person responsible for the care of the child when
  3 23 DHS conducts an initial face=to=face contact with that person.
  3 24 "Person responsible for the care of the child" is defined as
  3 25 a parent, guardian, foster parent, or relative or any other
  3 26 person with whom the child resides and who assumes care or
  3 27 supervision of the child.
  3 28    The bill also requires DHS to provide oral notice to a person
  3 29 responsible for the care of the child when DHS conducts an
  3 30 initial contact telephonically.  If a DHS child protection
  3 31 worker has face=to=face contact with the person responsible for
  3 32 the care of the child after an initial telephone contact, the
  3 33 DHS worker must provide written notice at the first initial

  3 35    The notice must provide that the person responsible for
  4  1 the care of the child is not required to allow the DHS child
  4  2 protection worker into the residence, is not required to
  4  3 speak to the DHS child protection worker, is entitled to seek
  4  4 representation of an attorney, and is not required to sign any
  4  5 document presented by the DHS child protection worker.  The
  4  6 notice must also provide that any statement made by the person
  4  7 responsible for the care of the child or other family member
  4  8 may be used against the person, that the DHS child protection
  4  9 worker is not an attorney and cannot provide legal advice,
  4 10 and that the person's failure to communicate with the child
  4 11 protection worker may have serious consequences.
  4 12    The bill requires DHS to make reasonable efforts to provide
  4 13 the notice in a manner which the person responsible for the
  4 14 care of the child can understand.  The written notice for

  3 17 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  3 18 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  3 19    This bill adds a notice of rights requirement to department
  3 20 of human services (DHS) child abuse investigations.  The bill
  3 21 requires a DHS child protection worker to provide written
  3 22 notice to a person responsible for the care of the child when
  3 23 DHS conducts an initial face=to=face contact with that person.
  3 24 "Person responsible for the care of the child" is defined as

  3 28    The bill also requires DHS to provide oral notice to a person
  3 29 responsible for the care of the child when DHS conducts an
  3 30 initial contact telephonically.  If a DHS child protection
  3 31 worker has face=to=face contact with the person responsible for
  3 32 the care of the child after an initial telephone contact, the
  3 33 DHS worker must provide written notice at the first initial
  3 34 face=to=face contact as well.
  3 35    The notice must provide that the person responsible for
  4  1 the care of the child is not required to allow the DHS child
  4  2 protection worker into the residence, is not required to
  4  3 speak to the DHS child protection worker, is entitled to seek
  4  4 representation of an attorney, and is not required to sign any
  4  5 document presented by the DHS child protection worker.  The
  4  6 notice must also provide that any statement made by the person
  4  7 responsible for the care of the child or other family member
  4  8 may be used against the person, that the DHS child protection
  4  9 worker is not an attorney and cannot provide legal advice,
  4 10 and that the person's failure to communicate with the child
  4 11 protection worker may have serious consequences.
  4 12    The bill requires DHS to make reasonable efforts to provide
  4 13 the notice in a manner which the person responsible for the
  4 14 care of the child can understand.  The written notice for
  4 15 face=to=face contacts must be signed and dated.
  4 16    The bill provides that any statement made by the person
  4 17 responsible for the care of the child, or by a child who
  4 18 is a family member of that person, is inadmissible in any
  4 19 administrative or court proceeding prior to the provision
  4 20 of the written notice.  Additionally, any statement made
  4 21 by the person responsible for the care of the child is
  4 22 inadmissible in any administrative or court proceeding prior to
  4 23 provision of oral notice when an initial contact was conducted
  4 24 telephonically.

  4  3 speak to the DHS child protection worker, is entitled to seek
  4  4 representation of an attorney, and is not required to sign any

  4  6 notice must also provide that any statement made by the person
  4  7 responsible for the care of the child or other family member
  4  8 may be used against the person, that the DHS child protection
  4  9 worker is not an attorney and cannot provide legal advice,
  4 10 and that the person's failure to communicate with the child
  4 11 protection worker may have serious consequences.
  4 12    The bill requires DHS to make reasonable efforts to provide
  4 13 the notice in a manner which the person responsible for the
  4 14 care of the child can understand.  The written notice for
  4 15 face=to=face contacts must be signed and dated.
  4 16    The bill provides that any statement made by the person
  4 17 responsible for the care of the child, or by a child who
  4 18 is a family member of that person, is inadmissible in any

  3 17 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  3 18 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  3 19    This bill adds a notice of rights requirement to department
  3 20 of human services (DHS) child abuse investigations.  The bill
  3 21 requires a DHS child protection worker to provide written
  3 22 notice to a person responsible for the care of the child when
  3 23 DHS conducts an initial face=to=face contact with that person.
  3 24 "Person responsible for the care of the child" is defined as
  3 25 a parent, guardian, foster parent, or relative or any other
  3 26 person with whom the child resides and who assumes care or
  3 27 supervision of the child.
  3 28    The bill also requires DHS to provide oral notice to a person
  3 29 responsible for the care of the child when DHS conducts an
  3 30 initial contact telephonically.  If a DHS child protection
  3 31 worker has face=to=face contact with the person responsible for
  3 32 the care of the child after an initial telephone contact, the
  3 33 DHS worker must provide written notice at the first initial
  3 34 face=to=face contact as well.
  3 35    The notice must provide that the person responsible for
  4  1 the care of the child is not required to allow the DHS child
  4  2 protection worker into the residence, is not required to
  4  3 speak to the DHS child protection worker, is entitled to seek
  4  4 representation of an attorney, and is not required to sign any
  4  5 document presented by the DHS child protection worker.  The
  4  6 notice must also provide that any statement made by the person
  4  7 responsible for the care of the child or other family member
  4  8 may be used against the person, that the DHS child protection
  4  9 worker is not an attorney and cannot provide legal advice,
  4 10 and that the person's failure to communicate with the child
  4 11 protection worker may have serious consequences.
  4 12    The bill requires DHS to make reasonable efforts to provide
  4 13 the notice in a manner which the person responsible for the
  4 14 care of the child can understand.  The written notice for
  4 15 face=to=face contacts must be signed and dated.
  4 16    The bill provides that any statement made by the person
  4 17 responsible for the care of the child, or by a child who
  4 18 is a family member of that person, is inadmissible in any
  4 19 administrative or court proceeding prior to the provision
  4 20 of the written notice.  Additionally, any statement made
  4 21 by the person responsible for the care of the child is
  4 22 inadmissible in any administrative or court proceeding prior to
  4 23 provision of oral notice when an initial contact was conducted
  4 24 telephonically.

  4  9 worker is not an attorney and cannot provide legal advice,
  4 10 and that the person's failure to communicate with the child
  4 11 protection worker may have serious consequences.
  4 12    The bill requires DHS to make reasonable efforts to provide
  4 13 the notice in a manner which the person responsible for the
  4 14 care of the child can understand.  The written notice for
  4 15 face=to=face contacts must be signed and dated.

  3 18 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  3 19    This bill adds a notice of rights requirement to department
  3 20 of human services (DHS) child abuse investigations.  The bill
  3 21 requires a DHS child protection worker to provide written
  3 22 notice to a person responsible for the care of the child when
  3 23 DHS conducts an initial face=to=face contact with that person.
  3 24 "Person responsible for the care of the child" is defined as

  3 26 person with whom the child resides and who assumes care or
  3 27 supervision of the child.
  3 28    The bill also requires DHS to provide oral notice to a person
  3 29 responsible for the care of the child when DHS conducts an
  3 30 initial contact telephonically.  If a DHS child protection

  3 32 the care of the child after an initial telephone contact, the
  3 33 DHS worker must provide written notice at the first initial
  3 34 face=to=face contact as well.

  4  1 the care of the child is not required to allow the DHS child
  4  2 protection worker into the residence, is not required to
  4  3 speak to the DHS child protection worker, is entitled to seek
  4  4 representation of an attorney, and is not required to sign any
  4  5 document presented by the DHS child protection worker.  The
  4  6 notice must also provide that any statement made by the person
  4  7 responsible for the care of the child or other family member
  4  8 may be used against the person, that the DHS child protection
  4  9 worker is not an attorney and cannot provide legal advice,
  4 10 and that the person's failure to communicate with the child
  4 11 protection worker may have serious consequences.
  4 12    The bill requires DHS to make reasonable efforts to provide
  4 13 the notice in a manner which the person responsible for the
  4 14 care of the child can understand.  The written notice for
  4 15 face=to=face contacts must be signed and dated.
  4 16    The bill provides that any statement made by the person
  4 17 responsible for the care of the child, or by a child who
  4 18 is a family member of that person, is inadmissible in any
  4 19 administrative or court proceeding prior to the provision

  3 21 requires a DHS child protection worker to provide written
  3 22 notice to a person responsible for the care of the child when
  3 23 DHS conducts an initial face=to=face contact with that person.
  3 24 "Person responsible for the care of the child" is defined as
  3 25 a parent, guardian, foster parent, or relative or any other
  3 26 person with whom the child resides and who assumes care or
  3 27 supervision of the child.
  3 28    The bill also requires DHS to provide oral notice to a person
  3 29 responsible for the care of the child when DHS conducts an
  3 30 initial contact telephonically.  If a DHS child protection
  3 31 worker has face=to=face contact with the person responsible for
  3 32 the care of the child after an initial telephone contact, the
  3 33 DHS worker must provide written notice at the first initial
  3 34 face=to=face contact as well.
  3 35    The notice must provide that the person responsible for
  4  1 the care of the child is not required to allow the DHS child
  4  2 protection worker into the residence, is not required to
  4  3 speak to the DHS child protection worker, is entitled to seek
  4  4 representation of an attorney, and is not required to sign any
  4  5 document presented by the DHS child protection worker.  The
  4  6 notice must also provide that any statement made by the person
  4  7 responsible for the care of the child or other family member
  4  8 may be used against the person, that the DHS child protection
  4  9 worker is not an attorney and cannot provide legal advice,
  4 10 and that the person's failure to communicate with the child
  4 11 protection worker may have serious consequences.
  4 12    The bill requires DHS to make reasonable efforts to provide
  4 13 the notice in a manner which the person responsible for the
  4 14 care of the child can understand.  The written notice for
  4 15 face=to=face contacts must be signed and dated.
  4 16    The bill provides that any statement made by the person
  4 17 responsible for the care of the child, or by a child who
  4 18 is a family member of that person, is inadmissible in any
  4 19 administrative or court proceeding prior to the provision
  4 20 of the written notice.  Additionally, any statement made
  4 21 by the person responsible for the care of the child is
  4 22 inadmissible in any administrative or court proceeding prior to
  4 23 provision of oral notice when an initial contact was conducted

  3 18 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  3 19    This bill adds a notice of rights requirement to department
  3 20 of human services (DHS) child abuse investigations.  The bill
  3 21 requires a DHS child protection worker to provide written
  3 22 notice to a person responsible for the care of the child when
  3 23 DHS conducts an initial face=to=face contact with that person.
  3 24 "Person responsible for the care of the child" is defined as

  3 29 responsible for the care of the child when DHS conducts an
  3 30 initial contact telephonically.  If a DHS child protection

  3 32 the care of the child after an initial telephone contact, the
  3 33 DHS worker must provide written notice at the first initial
  3 34 face=to=face contact as well.

  4  1 the care of the child is not required to allow the DHS child
  4  2 protection worker into the residence, is not required to
  4  3 speak to the DHS child protection worker, is entitled to seek
  4  4 representation of an attorney, and is not required to sign any
  4  5 document presented by the DHS child protection worker.  The
  4  6 notice must also provide that any statement made by the person
  4  7 responsible for the care of the child or other family member
  4  8 may be used against the person, that the DHS child protection
  4  9 worker is not an attorney and cannot provide legal advice,
  4 10 and that the person's failure to communicate with the child
  4 11 protection worker may have serious consequences.
  4 12    The bill requires DHS to make reasonable efforts to provide
  4 13 the notice in a manner which the person responsible for the
  4 14 care of the child can understand.  The written notice for
  4 15 face=to=face contacts must be signed and dated.
  4 16    The bill provides that any statement made by the person
  4 17 responsible for the care of the child, or by a child who
  4 18 is a family member of that person, is inadmissible in any
  4 19 administrative or court proceeding prior to the provision
