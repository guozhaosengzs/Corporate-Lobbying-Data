  9 10    Sec. 18.    9 10    Sec. 18.    9 11 state matching grants program.
  9 12    1.  The department shall establish a medical residency
  9 13 training state matching grants program to provide matching
  9 14 state funding to sponsors of accredited graduate medical
  9 15 education residency programs in this state to establish,
  9 16 expand, or support medical residency training programs.
  9 17 Funding for the program may be provided through the health
  9 18 care workforce shortage fund or the medical residency training
  9 19 account created in section 135.175.  For the purposes of this
  9 20 section, unless the context otherwise requires, "accredited"
  9 21 means a graduate medical education program approved by the
  9 22 accreditation council for graduate medical education or the
  9 23 American osteopathic association.  The grant funds may be
  9 24 used to support medical residency programs through any of the
  9 25 following:
  9 26    a.  The establishment of new or alternative campus accredited
  9 27 medical residency training programs.  For the purposes of
  9 28 this paragraph, "new or alternative campus accredited medical
  9 29 residency training program" means a program that is accredited
  9 30 by a recognized entity approved for such purpose by the
  9 31 accreditation council for graduate medical education or the

  9 34 of an insufficient period of operation is not eligible for
  9 35 accreditation on or before the date of submission of an
 10  1 application for a grant, may be deemed accredited if the
 10  2 accreditation council for graduate medical education or the
 10  3 American osteopathic association finds, after consultation with
 10  4 the appropriate accreditation entity, that there is reasonable
 10  5 assurance that the program will meet the accreditation
 10  6 standards of the entity prior to the date of graduation of the
 10  7 initial class in the program.
 10  8    b.  The provision of new residency positions within existing
 10  9 accredited medical residency or fellowship training programs.
 10 10    c.  The funding of residency positions which are in excess of
 10 11 the federal residency cap.  For the purposes of this paragraph,
 10 12 "in excess of the federal residency cap" means a residency
 10 13 position for which no federal Medicare funding is available
 10 14 because the residency position is a position beyond the cap for
 10 15 residency positions established by the federal Balanced Budget
 10 16 Act of 1997, Pub. L. No. 105=33.
 10 17    2.  The department shall adopt rules pursuant to chapter 17A
 10 18 to provide for all of the following:
 10 19    a.  Eligibility requirements for and qualifications

 10 28 residency cap, as defined in subsection 1, paragraph "c",
 10 29 exclusive of funds provided under the medical residency
 10 30 training state matching grants program established in this
 10 31 section, is deemed to have satisfied this requirement and
 10 32 shall be eligible for a matching grant equal to the amount of
 10 33 funds expended for such residency positions, subject to the
 10 34 limitation on the maximum award of grant funds specified in
 10 35 paragraph "e".
 11  1    (2)  A sponsor shall demonstrate, through documented
 11  2 financial information as prescribed by rule of the department,
 11  3 that funds have been reserved and will be expended by the
 11  4 sponsor in the amount required to provide matching funds for
 11  5 each residency proposed in the request for state matching
 11  6 funds.
 11  7    (3)  A sponsor shall demonstrate, through objective evidence
 11  8 as prescribed by rule of the department, a need for such
 11  9 residency program in the state.
 11 10    b.  The application process for the grant.
 11 11    c.  Criteria for preference in awarding of the grants,
 11 12 including preference in the residency specialty.
 11 13    d.  Determination of the amount of a grant.  The total amount
 11 14 of a grant awarded to a sponsor shall be limited to no more
 11 15 than twenty=five percent of the amount that the sponsor has
 11 16 demonstrated through documented financial information has been
 11 17 reserved and will be expended by the sponsor for each residency
 11 18 sponsored for the purpose of the residency program.
 11 19    e.  The maximum award of grant funds to a particular
 11 20 individual sponsor per year.  An individual sponsor shall not
 11 21 receive more than twenty=five percent of the state matching
 11 22 funds available each year to support the program.  However,
 11 23 if less than ninety=five percent of the available funds has
 11 24 been awarded in a given year, a sponsor may receive more than
 11 25 twenty=five percent of the state matching funds available
 11 26 if total funds awarded do not exceed ninety=five percent of
 11 27 the available funds.  If more than one sponsor meets the
 11 28 requirements of this section and has established, expanded,
 11 29 or supported a graduate medical residency training program,
 11 30 as specified in subsection 1, in excess of the sponsor's
 11 31 twenty=five percent maximum share of state matching funds, the
 11 32 state matching funds shall be divided proportionately among
 11 33 such sponsors.
 11 34    f.  Use of the funds awarded.  Funds may be used to pay the
 11 35 costs of establishing, expanding, or supporting an accredited
 12  1 graduate medical education program as specified in this
 12  2 section, including but not limited to the costs associated with
 12  3 residency stipends and physician faculty stipends.
 12  4    Sec. 19.  EFFECTIVE DATE.  This division of this Act, being
 12  5 deemed of immediate importance, takes effect upon enactment.
 12  6    Sec. 20.  APPLICABILITY.  This division of this Act applies

 12 14 program.
 12 15    1.  The department shall establish a medical residency
 12 16 training state matching grants program to provide matching
 12 17 state funding to sponsors of accredited graduate medical
 12 18 education residency programs in this state to establish,
 12 19 expand, or support medical residency training programs.
 12 20 Funding for the program may be provided through the health
 12 21 care workforce shortage fund or the medical residency training
 12 22 account created in section 135.175.  For the purposes of this
 12 23 section, unless the context otherwise requires, "accredited"
 12 24 means a graduate medical education program approved by the
 12 25 accreditation council for graduate medical education or the

 13  2 of an insufficient period of operation is not eligible for
 13  3 accreditation on or before the date of submission of an
 13  4 application for a grant, may be deemed accredited if the
 13  5 accreditation council for graduate medical education or the
