  4 28                           EXPLANATION
  4 29 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  4 30 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  4 31    This bill modifies the sex offender registry requirements by
  4 32 requiring sex offenders whose registration requirements have
  4 33 expired to reregister.
  4 34    The bill creates a tier IV offense and defines a tier IV
  4 35 offense to mean any sex offense that required a sex offender
  5  1 to register in this state or under another jurisdiction's sex
  5  2 offender registry but such registration has since expired.
  5  3    The bill requires a person who has been convicted of any
  5  4 sex offense classified as a tier IV offense to register as a
  5  5 sex offender in this state from the date the requirements to
  5  6 register as a tier I, II, or III offender in this state expire
  5  7 or when the person establishes a residence in this state.  A
  5  8 tier IV offender shall register as a tier IV offender in this
  5  9 state as long as the person resides in this state.
  5 10    The bill establishes the registration requirements for a
  5 11 tier IV offender which are different from other sex offenders
  5 12 who are required to register.  Under the bill, a tier IV
  5 13 offender shall, within 30 days of establishing a residence in
  5 14 this state or from the date the requirement to register as a
  5 15 tier I, II, or III offender in this state expires, appear in
  5 16 person to register with the sheriff of the county where the
  5 17 principal residence of the offender is maintained.  At the time
  5 18 of registration the tier IV offender is required to provide the
  5 19 sheriff with the offender's name, date of birth, residence,
  5 20 photograph, and county or jurisdiction where conviction
  5 21 requiring registration occurred. Current law provides that any
  5 22 new sex offender registrant must register with the sheriff of
  5 23 the county where the principal residence is maintained within
  5 24 five days of being required to do so and also requires a sex
  5 25 offender to provide more relevant information to the county
  5 26 sheriff.  The relevant information required to be provided to
  5 27 the county sheriff is listed in Code section 692A.101(23).
  5 28    The bill does not require a tier IV offender to periodically
  5 29 verify any relevant information or to notify the county sheriff
  5 30 when certain relevant information has changed.  However,
  5 31 the bill does require a tier IV offender who establishes
  5 32 a different residence in this state to, within 30 days of
  5 33 establishing such a residence, appear in person to register
  5 34 with the sheriff of the county where the principal residence
  5 35 is maintained even if that different principal residence is
  6  1 in the same county as the previous residence and provide the
  6  2 county sheriff with the relevant information required by the
  6  3 bill including allowing the sheriff to photograph the offender.
  6  4    The bill prohibits the posting of relevant information
  6  5 relating to tier IV on the sex offender registry internet site.
  6  6 The bill does permit a member of the public to contact the
  6  7 county sheriff's office to request relevant information about
  6  8 a tier IV offender, if the person provides the name of the sex
  6  9 offender and one of the following identifiers: date of birth,
  6 10 social security number, address, internet identifiers, or
  6 11 telephone number.
  6 12    The bill requires a tier IV offender to pay $25 to the
  6 13 sheriff of the county of principal residence at any time when
  6 14 the offender is required to register, including when the
  6 15 offender establishes a different principal residence.  Current
  6 16 law requires a sex offender to pay a $25 annual fee to the
  6 17 county sheriff.
  6 18    A tier IV offender who violates the bill commits an
  6 19 aggravated misdemeanor for a first offense and a class "D"
  6 20 felony for any second or subsequent offense.  A tier IV
  6 21 offender is guilty of a class "C" felony if the offender
  6 22 is convicted of an aggravated offense against a minor, a
  6 23 sex offense against a minor, or a sexually violent offense
  6 24 committed while in violation of any of the requirements
  6 25 specified in the bill.
  6 26    Depending on the nature of the offense committed, a tier
  6 27 IV offender may be subject to  exclusion zones and prohibition
  6 28 of certain employment=related activities under Code section
  6 29 692A.113, residency and child care restrictions under Code
  6 30 section 692A.114, and restricted employment where dependent
  6 31 adults reside under Code section 692A.115.
  6 32    A tier IV offender is not eligible to modify the registration
  6 33 requirements pursuant to Code section 692A.128.

  4 29 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  4 30 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  4 31    This bill modifies the sex offender registry requirements by
  4 32 requiring sex offenders whose registration requirements have
  4 33 expired to reregister.
  4 34    The bill creates a tier IV offense and defines a tier IV
  4 35 offense to mean any sex offense that required a sex offender
  5  1 to register in this state or under another jurisdiction's sex
  5  2 offender registry but such registration has since expired.
  5  3    The bill requires a person who has been convicted of any
  5  4 sex offense classified as a tier IV offense to register as a
  5  5 sex offender in this state from the date the requirements to
  5  6 register as a tier I, II, or III offender in this state expire
  5  7 or when the person establishes a residence in this state.  A
  5  8 tier IV offender shall register as a tier IV offender in this
  5  9 state as long as the person resides in this state.
  5 10    The bill establishes the registration requirements for a
  5 11 tier IV offender which are different from other sex offenders
  5 12 who are required to register.  Under the bill, a tier IV
  5 13 offender shall, within 30 days of establishing a residence in
  5 14 this state or from the date the requirement to register as a
  5 15 tier I, II, or III offender in this state expires, appear in
  5 16 person to register with the sheriff of the county where the
  5 17 principal residence of the offender is maintained.  At the time
  5 18 of registration the tier IV offender is required to provide the
  5 19 sheriff with the offender's name, date of birth, residence,
  5 20 photograph, and county or jurisdiction where conviction
  5 21 requiring registration occurred. Current law provides that any
  5 22 new sex offender registrant must register with the sheriff of
  5 23 the county where the principal residence is maintained within
  5 24 five days of being required to do so and also requires a sex
  5 25 offender to provide more relevant information to the county
  5 26 sheriff.  The relevant information required to be provided to
  5 27 the county sheriff is listed in Code section 692A.101(23).
  5 28    The bill does not require a tier IV offender to periodically
  5 29 verify any relevant information or to notify the county sheriff
  5 30 when certain relevant information has changed.  However,
  5 31 the bill does require a tier IV offender who establishes
  5 32 a different residence in this state to, within 30 days of
  5 33 establishing such a residence, appear in person to register
  5 34 with the sheriff of the county where the principal residence
  5 35 is maintained even if that different principal residence is
  6  1 in the same county as the previous residence and provide the
  6  2 county sheriff with the relevant information required by the
  6  3 bill including allowing the sheriff to photograph the offender.
  6  4    The bill prohibits the posting of relevant information
  6  5 relating to tier IV on the sex offender registry internet site.
  6  6 The bill does permit a member of the public to contact the
  6  7 county sheriff's office to request relevant information about
  6  8 a tier IV offender, if the person provides the name of the sex
  6  9 offender and one of the following identifiers: date of birth,
  6 10 social security number, address, internet identifiers, or
  6 11 telephone number.
  6 12    The bill requires a tier IV offender to pay $25 to the
  6 13 sheriff of the county of principal residence at any time when
  6 14 the offender is required to register, including when the
  6 15 offender establishes a different principal residence.  Current
  6 16 law requires a sex offender to pay a $25 annual fee to the
  6 17 county sheriff.
  6 18    A tier IV offender who violates the bill commits an
  6 19 aggravated misdemeanor for a first offense and a class "D"
  6 20 felony for any second or subsequent offense.  A tier IV
  6 21 offender is guilty of a class "C" felony if the offender
  6 22 is convicted of an aggravated offense against a minor, a
  6 23 sex offense against a minor, or a sexually violent offense
  6 24 committed while in violation of any of the requirements
  6 25 specified in the bill.
  6 26    Depending on the nature of the offense committed, a tier
  6 27 IV offender may be subject to  exclusion zones and prohibition
  6 28 of certain employment=related activities under Code section
  6 29 692A.113, residency and child care restrictions under Code
  6 30 section 692A.114, and restricted employment where dependent
