  1 23      1 21    Sec. 2.  Section 714.23, Code 2015, is amended by adding the
  1 22 following new subsection:
  1 23      1 22 following new subsection:
  1 23      1 23      1 24 tuition refund up to the full refund of tuition charges due to
  1 25 the effect of an interstate reciprocity agreement under 261G.4,
  1 26 subsection 1, may apply to the attorney general for a refund
  1 27 in a sum that represents the difference between any tuition
  1 28 refund received from the school and the full refund of tuition
  1 29 charges.  For purposes of this subsection, "full refund of
  1 30 tuition charges" means the monetary sum of the refund for which
  1 31 the student would be eligible pursuant to the application of
  1 32 this section.
  1 33    b.  A tuition refund fund is created as a separate fund
  1 34 in the office of the treasurer of state under the control
  1 35 of the attorney general.  Moneys credited to the fund shall
  2  1 include amounts appropriated by the general assembly and moneys
  2  2 received as a result of a court order, judgment, or settlement
  2  3 which specifically directs that moneys be used for the purpose
  2  4 of providing student tuition refunds, or which authorizes the
  2  5 attorney general to use moneys for any other purpose at the
  2  6 discretion of the attorney general.  All moneys credited to
  2  7 the fund are appropriated and made available to the attorney
  2  8 general for such purposes.  For each fiscal year, the attorney
  2  9 general may expend all moneys in the fund to provide tuition
  2 10 refunds to eligible students. Notwithstanding section 8.33,
  2 11 any balance in the fund on June 30 of each fiscal year shall not
  2 12 revert to the general fund of the state, but shall be available
  2 13 for purposes of this subsection in subsequent fiscal years.
  2 14 Notwithstanding section 12C.7, interest or earnings on the
  2 15 moneys in the fund shall be credited to the fund.
  2 16    Sec. 3.  EFFECTIVE UPON ENACTMENT.  This Act, being deemed of
  2 17 immediate importance, takes effect upon enactment.
  2 18                           EXPLANATION
  2 19 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  2 20 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  2 21    This bill allows the provisions of an interstate student
  2 22 tuition reciprocity agreement entered into and administered, or
  2 23 recognized, by the college student aid commission to override
  2 24 the registration and disclosure provisions of Code sections
  2 25 714.23, which regulates postsecondary educational program
  2 26 refund policies, and 714.25, which establishes disclosure
  2 27 requirements for proprietary schools, as those sections apply
  2 28 to participating postsecondary educational institutions. The
  2 29 bill also creates within the state treasury a tuition refund
  2 30 fund under the control of the attorney general.
  2 31    The bill amends Code section 714.23 to provide that a
  2 32 student who, because of the effect of an interstate reciprocity
  2 33 agreement, does not receive the full tuition refund as would
  2 34 otherwise be required under the Code provision, may apply to
  2 35 the attorney general for a refund in a sum that represents the
  3  1 difference between any tuition refund received from the school
  3  2 and the full refund of tuition charges as otherwise required.
  3  3    Moneys credited to the fund shall include amounts
  3  4 appropriated by the general assembly and moneys received as
  3  5 a result of a court order, judgment, or settlement which
  3  6 specifically directs that moneys be used for the purpose of
