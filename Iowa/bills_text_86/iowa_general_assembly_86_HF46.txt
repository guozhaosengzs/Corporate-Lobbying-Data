  5  1                           EXPLANATION
  5  2 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  5  3 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  5  4    This bill provides that an individual has a right to engage
  5  5 in a lawful occupation free from any substantial burden
  5  6 imposed by an occupational regulation unless the government
  5  7 demonstrates with respect to such occupational regulation that
  5  8 the government has a compelling interest in protecting against
  5  9 present and recognizable harm to the public health or safety
  5 10 and the occupational regulation is the least restrictive means
  5 11 of furthering that compelling governmental interest.
  5 12    An individual may assert as a defense in any judicial or
  5 13 administrative proceeding brought by the government to enforce
  5 14 an occupational regulation that such occupational regulation
  5 15 violates this right. An individual may also bring an action
  5 16 for declaratory judgment or injunctive or other equitable
  5 17 relief against the government for an occupational regulation
  5 18 that violates this right. An individual need not exhaust
  5 19 administrative remedies to bring such an action.
  5 20    An individual who asserts such a defense or brings such an
  5 21 action has the initial burden of proof that an occupational
  5 22 regulation substantially burdens the individual's right to
  5 23 engage in a lawful occupation. If the individual meets the
  5 24 burden of proof, the government must demonstrate by clear
  5 25 and convincing evidence that the government has a compelling
  5 26 interest in protecting against present and recognizable harm
  5 27 to the public health or safety, and that the occupational
  5 28 regulation is the least restrictive means for furthering that
  5 29 compelling governmental interest. The presiding officer or
  5 30 court in such a proceeding shall make its own findings of
  5 31 fact and conclusions of law with no deference given to any
  5 32 determination by the government or in statute or rule that
  5 33 an occupational regulation serves a compelling governmental
  5 34 interest in protecting against present and recognizable harm to
  5 35 the public health or safety or that the occupational regulation
  6  1 is the least restrictive means of furthering a compelling
  6  2 governmental interest. An employer may assert a defense
  6  3 or bring an action on behalf of an employee or prospective
  6  4 employee.
  6  5    The bill defines "occupational regulation" as a statute,
  6  6 ordinance, rule, practice, policy, or other requirement in law
  6  7 that an individual possess certain personal qualifications
  6  8 in order to engage in a lawful occupation. "Occupational
  6  9 regulation" excludes a business license and zoning and
  6 10 land use regulations except to the extent such requirements
  6 11 regulate an individual's personal qualifications to perform
  6 12 a lawful occupation. The bill defines "substantial burden"
  6 13 as a requirement in an occupational regulation that imposes
  6 14 significant difficulty or cost on an individual seeking to
  6 15 enter into or continue in a lawful occupation. "Substantial
  6 16 burden" means a burden that is more than incidental. The
  6 17 bill defines "government" as any agency or other entity
  6 18 of government of this state or of any of its political
  6 19 subdivisions.
  6 20    The bill defines "least restrictive means of furthering
  6 21 a compelling governmental interest" as, from least to most
  6 22 restrictive, absence of any occupational regulations, a
  6 23 provision for private civil action in small claims or district
  6 24 court to remedy consumer harm, inspection requirements,
  6 25 bonding or insurance requirements, registration requirements,
  6 26 certification requirements, and occupational license
  6 27 requirements.
  6 28    The bill permits an individual to use the words "registered"
  6 29 or "certified" as a designated title or as part of a designated
  6 30 title if the individual meets the requirements for registration
  6 31 or certification established by a private registration or
  6 32 certification organization. An individual cannot portray such
  6 33 registration or certification as granted by the government.
  6 34    The bill is to be liberally construed to protect the right
  6 35 established by the bill. The bill is not to be construed to
  7  1 create a right of action against a private party or to require
  7  2 a private party to do business with an individual who is not
  7  3 licensed, certified, or registered with the government. The

  5  1                           EXPLANATION
  5  2 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  5  3 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  5  4    This bill provides that an individual has a right to engage
  5  5 in a lawful occupation free from any substantial burden
  5  6 imposed by an occupational regulation unless the government
  5  7 demonstrates with respect to such occupational regulation that
  5  8 the government has a compelling interest in protecting against
  5  9 present and recognizable harm to the public health or safety
  5 10 and the occupational regulation is the least restrictive means
  5 11 of furthering that compelling governmental interest.
  5 12    An individual may assert as a defense in any judicial or
  5 13 administrative proceeding brought by the government to enforce
  5 14 an occupational regulation that such occupational regulation
  5 15 violates this right. An individual may also bring an action
  5 16 for declaratory judgment or injunctive or other equitable
  5 17 relief against the government for an occupational regulation
  5 18 that violates this right. An individual need not exhaust
  5 19 administrative remedies to bring such an action.
  5 20    An individual who asserts such a defense or brings such an
  5 21 action has the initial burden of proof that an occupational
  5 22 regulation substantially burdens the individual's right to
  5 23 engage in a lawful occupation. If the individual meets the
  5 24 burden of proof, the government must demonstrate by clear
  5 25 and convincing evidence that the government has a compelling
  5 26 interest in protecting against present and recognizable harm
  5 27 to the public health or safety, and that the occupational
  5 28 regulation is the least restrictive means for furthering that
  5 29 compelling governmental interest. The presiding officer or
  5 30 court in such a proceeding shall make its own findings of
  5 31 fact and conclusions of law with no deference given to any
  5 32 determination by the government or in statute or rule that
  5 33 an occupational regulation serves a compelling governmental
  5 34 interest in protecting against present and recognizable harm to
  5 35 the public health or safety or that the occupational regulation
  6  1 is the least restrictive means of furthering a compelling
  6  2 governmental interest. An employer may assert a defense
  6  3 or bring an action on behalf of an employee or prospective
  6  4 employee.
  6  5    The bill defines "occupational regulation" as a statute,
  6  6 ordinance, rule, practice, policy, or other requirement in law
  6  7 that an individual possess certain personal qualifications
  6  8 in order to engage in a lawful occupation. "Occupational
  6  9 regulation" excludes a business license and zoning and
  6 10 land use regulations except to the extent such requirements
  6 11 regulate an individual's personal qualifications to perform
  6 12 a lawful occupation. The bill defines "substantial burden"
  6 13 as a requirement in an occupational regulation that imposes
  6 14 significant difficulty or cost on an individual seeking to
  6 15 enter into or continue in a lawful occupation. "Substantial
  6 16 burden" means a burden that is more than incidental. The
  6 17 bill defines "government" as any agency or other entity
  6 18 of government of this state or of any of its political
  6 19 subdivisions.
  6 20    The bill defines "least restrictive means of furthering
  6 21 a compelling governmental interest" as, from least to most
  6 22 restrictive, absence of any occupational regulations, a
  6 23 provision for private civil action in small claims or district
  6 24 court to remedy consumer harm, inspection requirements,
  6 25 bonding or insurance requirements, registration requirements,
  6 26 certification requirements, and occupational license
  6 27 requirements.
  6 28    The bill permits an individual to use the words "registered"
  6 29 or "certified" as a designated title or as part of a designated
  6 30 title if the individual meets the requirements for registration
  6 31 or certification established by a private registration or
  6 32 certification organization. An individual cannot portray such
  6 33 registration or certification as granted by the government.
  6 34    The bill is to be liberally construed to protect the right
  6 35 established by the bill. The bill is not to be construed to
  7  1 create a right of action against a private party or to require
  7  2 a private party to do business with an individual who is not
  7  3 licensed, certified, or registered with the government. The
  7  4 bill is not to be construed to create a right of action against
  7  5 the federal government for its use of a state occupational

  5  4    This bill provides that an individual has a right to engage
  5  5 in a lawful occupation free from any substantial burden
  5  6 imposed by an occupational regulation unless the government
  5  7 demonstrates with respect to such occupational regulation that
  5  8 the government has a compelling interest in protecting against
  5  9 present and recognizable harm to the public health or safety
  5 10 and the occupational regulation is the least restrictive means
  5 11 of furthering that compelling governmental interest.
  5 12    An individual may assert as a defense in any judicial or
  5 13 administrative proceeding brought by the government to enforce
  5 14 an occupational regulation that such occupational regulation
  5 15 violates this right. An individual may also bring an action
  5 16 for declaratory judgment or injunctive or other equitable
  5 17 relief against the government for an occupational regulation
  5 18 that violates this right. An individual need not exhaust
  5 19 administrative remedies to bring such an action.
  5 20    An individual who asserts such a defense or brings such an
  5 21 action has the initial burden of proof that an occupational
  5 22 regulation substantially burdens the individual's right to
  5 23 engage in a lawful occupation. If the individual meets the
  5 24 burden of proof, the government must demonstrate by clear
  5 25 and convincing evidence that the government has a compelling
  5 26 interest in protecting against present and recognizable harm
  5 27 to the public health or safety, and that the occupational
  5 28 regulation is the least restrictive means for furthering that
  5 29 compelling governmental interest. The presiding officer or
  5 30 court in such a proceeding shall make its own findings of
  5 31 fact and conclusions of law with no deference given to any
  5 32 determination by the government or in statute or rule that
  5 33 an occupational regulation serves a compelling governmental
  5 34 interest in protecting against present and recognizable harm to
  5 35 the public health or safety or that the occupational regulation
  6  1 is the least restrictive means of furthering a compelling
  6  2 governmental interest. An employer may assert a defense
  6  3 or bring an action on behalf of an employee or prospective
  6  4 employee.

  6  8 in order to engage in a lawful occupation. "Occupational
  6  9 regulation" excludes a business license and zoning and
  6 10 land use regulations except to the extent such requirements
  6 11 regulate an individual's personal qualifications to perform
  6 12 a lawful occupation. The bill defines "substantial burden"
  6 13 as a requirement in an occupational regulation that imposes
  6 14 significant difficulty or cost on an individual seeking to
  6 15 enter into or continue in a lawful occupation. "Substantial
  6 16 burden" means a burden that is more than incidental. The
  6 17 bill defines "government" as any agency or other entity
  6 18 of government of this state or of any of its political
