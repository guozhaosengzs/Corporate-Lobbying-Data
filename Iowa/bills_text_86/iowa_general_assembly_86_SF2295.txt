  1 31    (b)  The election shall apply to all subsequent sales or
  1 32 exchanges of the elected capital stock, provided it is capital

  1 34 employee=owner while employed by such qualified corporation.
  1 35    (c)  The election shall apply to transfers of the capital
  2  1 stock by inter vivos gift from the employee=owner to the
  2  2 employee=owner's spouse or lineal descendants, or to a trust

  3  3    (A)  The corporation has been in existence and actively doing
  3  4 business in this state for at least ten years.
  3  5    (B)  The corporation has at least five shareholders.
  3  6    (C)  The corporation has at least two shareholders or
  3  7 groups of shareholders who are not related.  Two persons are
  3  8 considered related when, under section 318 of the Internal
  3  9 Revenue Code, one is a person who owns, directly or indirectly,
  3 10 capital stock that if directly owned would be attributed to the
  3 11 other person, or is the brother, sister, aunt, uncle, cousin,
  3 12 niece, or nephew of the other person who owns capital stock
  3 13 either directly or indirectly.
  3 14    (ii)  A qualified corporation shall include any member
  3 15 of an affiliated group, as defined in section 422.32, if the
  3 16 affiliated group includes a member that has been in existence

  3 18 years.
  3 19    (iii)  A qualified corporation shall include any corporation

  3 22 or after the employment of the employee=owner.
  3 23    Sec. 3.  APPLICABILITY.  This Act applies to tax years
  3 24 beginning on or after January 1, 2017.
  3 25                           EXPLANATION
  3 26 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  3 27 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  3 28    This bill grants an employee=owner, as defined in the
  3 29 bill, one irrevocable lifetime election to exclude from state
  3 30 individual income tax the net capital gain from the sale of the
  3 31 capital stock of one qualified corporation.
  3 32    The capital gain exclusion is phased in over a six=year
  3 33 period beginning with a 50 percent exclusion for tax years
  3 34 beginning in calendar year 2017, and increasing 10 percent each
  3 35 calendar year until the exclusion equals 100 percent for tax
  4  1 years beginning on or after January 1, 2022.
  4  2    Several requirements must be met for capital stock to
  4  3 qualify as capital stock of a qualified corporation. First,
  4  4 the stock must be either voting or nonvoting, common or
  4  5 preferred stock. Stock rights, stock warrants, stock options,
  4  6 and debt securities do not qualify. Second, the corporation
  4  7 that issued the stock must be in existence and actively doing
  4  8 business in Iowa for at least 10 years. A corporation that
  4  9 is part of an affiliated group will qualify if the affiliated
  4 10 group includes a member that has been in existence and actively
  4 11 doing business in Iowa for at least 10 years. Third, the
  4 12 corporation that issued the stock must have at least five
  4 13 shareholders, two of whom must not be related. Fourth, the
  4 14 stock must have been acquired by the employee=owner while
  4 15 employed by the corporation. A corporation will qualify
  4 16 if it is a party to a reorganization that was entirely or
  4 17 substantially tax free as long as the reorganization occurred
  4 18 during or after the employee=owner's employment.
  4 19    The election shall apply to all subsequent sales of the
  4 20 elected capital stock, provided it is capital stock in the same
  4 21 qualified corporation and was acquired by the employee=owner
  4 22 while employed by the corporation.
  4 23    The bill provides that the election applies to transfers of
  4 24 the capital stock by inter vivos gift from the employee=owner
  4 25 to a spouse or lineal descendant, or to a trust for the benefit
  4 26 of the employee=owner's spouse or lineal descendant. The
  4 27 election will apply to a spouse only if the spouse was married
  4 28 to the employee=owner on the date of the sale or the date of the
  4 29 employee=owner's death.
  4 30    If, after making a valid inter vivos transfer of stock that
  4 31 meets all the requirements for an election, an employee=owner
  4 32 dies without making an election, the surviving spouse, or if
  4 33 there is no surviving spouse, the personal representative of
  4 34 the employee=owner's estate may make the election.
  4 35    An election is made by including a written statement
  5  1 containing certain required information, as specified in the
  5  2 bill, with the taxpayer's Iowa income tax return for the
  5  3 taxable year in which the election is made.  The department of
  5  4 revenue is required to provide appropriate forms for making
  5  5 elections and reporting exclusions.
  5  6    The bill applies to tax years beginning on or after January
  5  7 1, 2017.

  3 25                           EXPLANATION
  3 26 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  3 27 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  3 28    This bill grants an employee=owner, as defined in the
  3 29 bill, one irrevocable lifetime election to exclude from state
  3 30 individual income tax the net capital gain from the sale of the
  3 31 capital stock of one qualified corporation.
  3 32    The capital gain exclusion is phased in over a six=year
  3 33 period beginning with a 50 percent exclusion for tax years
  3 34 beginning in calendar year 2017, and increasing 10 percent each
  3 35 calendar year until the exclusion equals 100 percent for tax
  4  1 years beginning on or after January 1, 2022.
  4  2    Several requirements must be met for capital stock to
  4  3 qualify as capital stock of a qualified corporation. First,
  4  4 the stock must be either voting or nonvoting, common or
  4  5 preferred stock. Stock rights, stock warrants, stock options,
  4  6 and debt securities do not qualify. Second, the corporation
  4  7 that issued the stock must be in existence and actively doing
  4  8 business in Iowa for at least 10 years. A corporation that
  4  9 is part of an affiliated group will qualify if the affiliated
  4 10 group includes a member that has been in existence and actively
  4 11 doing business in Iowa for at least 10 years. Third, the
  4 12 corporation that issued the stock must have at least five
  4 13 shareholders, two of whom must not be related. Fourth, the
  4 14 stock must have been acquired by the employee=owner while
  4 15 employed by the corporation. A corporation will qualify
  4 16 if it is a party to a reorganization that was entirely or
  4 17 substantially tax free as long as the reorganization occurred
  4 18 during or after the employee=owner's employment.
  4 19    The election shall apply to all subsequent sales of the
  4 20 elected capital stock, provided it is capital stock in the same
  4 21 qualified corporation and was acquired by the employee=owner
  4 22 while employed by the corporation.
  4 23    The bill provides that the election applies to transfers of
  4 24 the capital stock by inter vivos gift from the employee=owner
  4 25 to a spouse or lineal descendant, or to a trust for the benefit
  4 26 of the employee=owner's spouse or lineal descendant. The
  4 27 election will apply to a spouse only if the spouse was married
  4 28 to the employee=owner on the date of the sale or the date of the
  4 29 employee=owner's death.
  4 30    If, after making a valid inter vivos transfer of stock that
  4 31 meets all the requirements for an election, an employee=owner
  4 32 dies without making an election, the surviving spouse, or if
  4 33 there is no surviving spouse, the personal representative of
  4 34 the employee=owner's estate may make the election.
  4 35    An election is made by including a written statement
  5  1 containing certain required information, as specified in the

  3  5    (B)  The corporation has at least five shareholders.
  3  6    (C)  The corporation has at least two shareholders or

  3 10 capital stock that if directly owned would be attributed to the
  3 11 other person, or is the brother, sister, aunt, uncle, cousin,

  3 25                           EXPLANATION
  3 26 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  3 27 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  3 28    This bill grants an employee=owner, as defined in the
  3 29 bill, one irrevocable lifetime election to exclude from state
  3 30 individual income tax the net capital gain from the sale of the
  3 31 capital stock of one qualified corporation.
  3 32    The capital gain exclusion is phased in over a six=year
  3 33 period beginning with a 50 percent exclusion for tax years
  3 34 beginning in calendar year 2017, and increasing 10 percent each
  3 35 calendar year until the exclusion equals 100 percent for tax
  4  1 years beginning on or after January 1, 2022.
  4  2    Several requirements must be met for capital stock to
  4  3 qualify as capital stock of a qualified corporation. First,
  4  4 the stock must be either voting or nonvoting, common or
  4  5 preferred stock. Stock rights, stock warrants, stock options,
  4  6 and debt securities do not qualify. Second, the corporation
  4  7 that issued the stock must be in existence and actively doing
  4  8 business in Iowa for at least 10 years. A corporation that
  4  9 is part of an affiliated group will qualify if the affiliated
  4 10 group includes a member that has been in existence and actively
  4 11 doing business in Iowa for at least 10 years. Third, the
  4 12 corporation that issued the stock must have at least five
  4 13 shareholders, two of whom must not be related. Fourth, the
  4 14 stock must have been acquired by the employee=owner while
  4 15 employed by the corporation. A corporation will qualify
  4 16 if it is a party to a reorganization that was entirely or
  4 17 substantially tax free as long as the reorganization occurred
  4 18 during or after the employee=owner's employment.
  4 19    The election shall apply to all subsequent sales of the
  4 20 elected capital stock, provided it is capital stock in the same
  4 21 qualified corporation and was acquired by the employee=owner
  4 22 while employed by the corporation.
  4 23    The bill provides that the election applies to transfers of
  4 24 the capital stock by inter vivos gift from the employee=owner
  4 25 to a spouse or lineal descendant, or to a trust for the benefit
  4 26 of the employee=owner's spouse or lineal descendant. The
  4 27 election will apply to a spouse only if the spouse was married
  4 28 to the employee=owner on the date of the sale or the date of the
  4 29 employee=owner's death.
  4 30    If, after making a valid inter vivos transfer of stock that
  4 31 meets all the requirements for an election, an employee=owner
  4 32 dies without making an election, the surviving spouse, or if
  4 33 there is no surviving spouse, the personal representative of
  4 34 the employee=owner's estate may make the election.
  4 35    An election is made by including a written statement
  5  1 containing certain required information, as specified in the
  5  2 bill, with the taxpayer's Iowa income tax return for the
  5  3 taxable year in which the election is made.  The department of

  5  5 elections and reporting exclusions.

  3  5    (B)  The corporation has at least five shareholders.
  3  6    (C)  The corporation has at least two shareholders or

  3 10 capital stock that if directly owned would be attributed to the
  3 11 other person, or is the brother, sister, aunt, uncle, cousin,

  3 25                           EXPLANATION
  3 26 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  3 27 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  3 28    This bill grants an employee=owner, as defined in the
  3 29 bill, one irrevocable lifetime election to exclude from state
  3 30 individual income tax the net capital gain from the sale of the
  3 31 capital stock of one qualified corporation.
  3 32    The capital gain exclusion is phased in over a six=year
  3 33 period beginning with a 50 percent exclusion for tax years
  3 34 beginning in calendar year 2017, and increasing 10 percent each
  3 35 calendar year until the exclusion equals 100 percent for tax
  4  1 years beginning on or after January 1, 2022.
  4  2    Several requirements must be met for capital stock to
  4  3 qualify as capital stock of a qualified corporation. First,
  4  4 the stock must be either voting or nonvoting, common or
  4  5 preferred stock. Stock rights, stock warrants, stock options,
  4  6 and debt securities do not qualify. Second, the corporation
  4  7 that issued the stock must be in existence and actively doing
  4  8 business in Iowa for at least 10 years. A corporation that
  4  9 is part of an affiliated group will qualify if the affiliated
  4 10 group includes a member that has been in existence and actively
  4 11 doing business in Iowa for at least 10 years. Third, the
  4 12 corporation that issued the stock must have at least five
  4 13 shareholders, two of whom must not be related. Fourth, the
  4 14 stock must have been acquired by the employee=owner while
  4 15 employed by the corporation. A corporation will qualify
  4 16 if it is a party to a reorganization that was entirely or
  4 17 substantially tax free as long as the reorganization occurred
  4 18 during or after the employee=owner's employment.
  4 19    The election shall apply to all subsequent sales of the
  4 20 elected capital stock, provided it is capital stock in the same
  4 21 qualified corporation and was acquired by the employee=owner
  4 22 while employed by the corporation.
  4 23    The bill provides that the election applies to transfers of
  4 24 the capital stock by inter vivos gift from the employee=owner
  4 25 to a spouse or lineal descendant, or to a trust for the benefit
  4 26 of the employee=owner's spouse or lineal descendant. The
  4 27 election will apply to a spouse only if the spouse was married
  4 28 to the employee=owner on the date of the sale or the date of the
  4 29 employee=owner's death.
  4 30    If, after making a valid inter vivos transfer of stock that
  4 31 meets all the requirements for an election, an employee=owner
  4 32 dies without making an election, the surviving spouse, or if
  4 33 there is no surviving spouse, the personal representative of
  4 34 the employee=owner's estate may make the election.
  4 35    An election is made by including a written statement
  5  1 containing certain required information, as specified in the
  5  2 bill, with the taxpayer's Iowa income tax return for the
  5  3 taxable year in which the election is made.  The department of

  3 25                           EXPLANATION
  3 26 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  3 27 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  3 28    This bill grants an employee=owner, as defined in the
  3 29 bill, one irrevocable lifetime election to exclude from state
  3 30 individual income tax the net capital gain from the sale of the
  3 31 capital stock of one qualified corporation.
  3 32    The capital gain exclusion is phased in over a six=year
  3 33 period beginning with a 50 percent exclusion for tax years
  3 34 beginning in calendar year 2017, and increasing 10 percent each
  3 35 calendar year until the exclusion equals 100 percent for tax
  4  1 years beginning on or after January 1, 2022.
  4  2    Several requirements must be met for capital stock to
  4  3 qualify as capital stock of a qualified corporation. First,
  4  4 the stock must be either voting or nonvoting, common or
  4  5 preferred stock. Stock rights, stock warrants, stock options,
  4  6 and debt securities do not qualify. Second, the corporation
  4  7 that issued the stock must be in existence and actively doing
  4  8 business in Iowa for at least 10 years. A corporation that
  4  9 is part of an affiliated group will qualify if the affiliated
  4 10 group includes a member that has been in existence and actively
  4 11 doing business in Iowa for at least 10 years. Third, the
  4 12 corporation that issued the stock must have at least five
  4 13 shareholders, two of whom must not be related. Fourth, the
  4 14 stock must have been acquired by the employee=owner while
  4 15 employed by the corporation. A corporation will qualify
  4 16 if it is a party to a reorganization that was entirely or
  4 17 substantially tax free as long as the reorganization occurred
  4 18 during or after the employee=owner's employment.
  4 19    The election shall apply to all subsequent sales of the
  4 20 elected capital stock, provided it is capital stock in the same
  4 21 qualified corporation and was acquired by the employee=owner
  4 22 while employed by the corporation.
  4 23    The bill provides that the election applies to transfers of
  4 24 the capital stock by inter vivos gift from the employee=owner
  4 25 to a spouse or lineal descendant, or to a trust for the benefit
  4 26 of the employee=owner's spouse or lineal descendant. The
  4 27 election will apply to a spouse only if the spouse was married
  4 28 to the employee=owner on the date of the sale or the date of the
  4 29 employee=owner's death.
  4 30    If, after making a valid inter vivos transfer of stock that
  4 31 meets all the requirements for an election, an employee=owner
  4 32 dies without making an election, the surviving spouse, or if
  4 33 there is no surviving spouse, the personal representative of
  4 34 the employee=owner's estate may make the election.
  4 35    An election is made by including a written statement
  5  1 containing certain required information, as specified in the
  5  2 bill, with the taxpayer's Iowa income tax return for the
  5  3 taxable year in which the election is made.  The department of

  5  5 elections and reporting exclusions.

  3  5    (B)  The corporation has at least five shareholders.
  3  6    (C)  The corporation has at least two shareholders or

  3 25                           EXPLANATION
  3 26 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  3 27 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  3 28    This bill grants an employee=owner, as defined in the
  3 29 bill, one irrevocable lifetime election to exclude from state
  3 30 individual income tax the net capital gain from the sale of the
  3 31 capital stock of one qualified corporation.
  3 32    The capital gain exclusion is phased in over a six=year
  3 33 period beginning with a 50 percent exclusion for tax years
  3 34 beginning in calendar year 2017, and increasing 10 percent each
  3 35 calendar year until the exclusion equals 100 percent for tax
  4  1 years beginning on or after January 1, 2022.
  4  2    Several requirements must be met for capital stock to
  4  3 qualify as capital stock of a qualified corporation. First,
  4  4 the stock must be either voting or nonvoting, common or
  4  5 preferred stock. Stock rights, stock warrants, stock options,
  4  6 and debt securities do not qualify. Second, the corporation
  4  7 that issued the stock must be in existence and actively doing
  4  8 business in Iowa for at least 10 years. A corporation that
  4  9 is part of an affiliated group will qualify if the affiliated
  4 10 group includes a member that has been in existence and actively
  4 11 doing business in Iowa for at least 10 years. Third, the
  4 12 corporation that issued the stock must have at least five
  4 13 shareholders, two of whom must not be related. Fourth, the
  4 14 stock must have been acquired by the employee=owner while
  4 15 employed by the corporation. A corporation will qualify
  4 16 if it is a party to a reorganization that was entirely or
  4 17 substantially tax free as long as the reorganization occurred
  4 18 during or after the employee=owner's employment.
  4 19    The election shall apply to all subsequent sales of the
  4 20 elected capital stock, provided it is capital stock in the same
  4 21 qualified corporation and was acquired by the employee=owner
  4 22 while employed by the corporation.
  4 23    The bill provides that the election applies to transfers of
  4 24 the capital stock by inter vivos gift from the employee=owner
  4 25 to a spouse or lineal descendant, or to a trust for the benefit
  4 26 of the employee=owner's spouse or lineal descendant. The
  4 27 election will apply to a spouse only if the spouse was married
  4 28 to the employee=owner on the date of the sale or the date of the
  4 29 employee=owner's death.
  4 30    If, after making a valid inter vivos transfer of stock that
  4 31 meets all the requirements for an election, an employee=owner
  4 32 dies without making an election, the surviving spouse, or if
  4 33 there is no surviving spouse, the personal representative of
  4 34 the employee=owner's estate may make the election.
  4 35    An election is made by including a written statement
  5  1 containing certain required information, as specified in the
  5  2 bill, with the taxpayer's Iowa income tax return for the
  5  3 taxable year in which the election is made.  The department of
  5  4 revenue is required to provide appropriate forms for making
  5  5 elections and reporting exclusions.

  5  7 1, 2017.

  3 25                           EXPLANATION

  3 27 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  3 28    This bill grants an employee=owner, as defined in the
  3 29 bill, one irrevocable lifetime election to exclude from state
  3 30 individual income tax the net capital gain from the sale of the
  3 31 capital stock of one qualified corporation.
  3 32    The capital gain exclusion is phased in over a six=year
  3 33 period beginning with a 50 percent exclusion for tax years
  3 34 beginning in calendar year 2017, and increasing 10 percent each
  3 35 calendar year until the exclusion equals 100 percent for tax
  4  1 years beginning on or after January 1, 2022.
  4  2    Several requirements must be met for capital stock to
  4  3 qualify as capital stock of a qualified corporation. First,
  4  4 the stock must be either voting or nonvoting, common or
  4  5 preferred stock. Stock rights, stock warrants, stock options,
  4  6 and debt securities do not qualify. Second, the corporation
  4  7 that issued the stock must be in existence and actively doing
  4  8 business in Iowa for at least 10 years. A corporation that
  4  9 is part of an affiliated group will qualify if the affiliated
  4 10 group includes a member that has been in existence and actively

  4 13 shareholders, two of whom must not be related. Fourth, the
  4 14 stock must have been acquired by the employee=owner while

  4 16 if it is a party to a reorganization that was entirely or
  4 17 substantially tax free as long as the reorganization occurred
  4 18 during or after the employee=owner's employment.
  4 19    The election shall apply to all subsequent sales of the
  4 20 elected capital stock, provided it is capital stock in the same
  4 21 qualified corporation and was acquired by the employee=owner
  4 22 while employed by the corporation.
  4 23    The bill provides that the election applies to transfers of
  4 24 the capital stock by inter vivos gift from the employee=owner
  4 25 to a spouse or lineal descendant, or to a trust for the benefit
  4 26 of the employee=owner's spouse or lineal descendant. The
  4 27 election will apply to a spouse only if the spouse was married
  4 28 to the employee=owner on the date of the sale or the date of the
  4 29 employee=owner's death.
  4 30    If, after making a valid inter vivos transfer of stock that
  4 31 meets all the requirements for an election, an employee=owner
  4 32 dies without making an election, the surviving spouse, or if
  4 33 there is no surviving spouse, the personal representative of
  4 34 the employee=owner's estate may make the election.
  4 35    An election is made by including a written statement
  5  1 containing certain required information, as specified in the
  5  2 bill, with the taxpayer's Iowa income tax return for the
  5  3 taxable year in which the election is made.  The department of

  3 31 capital stock of one qualified corporation.
  3 32    The capital gain exclusion is phased in over a six=year
  3 33 period beginning with a 50 percent exclusion for tax years
  3 34 beginning in calendar year 2017, and increasing 10 percent each

  4 18 during or after the employee=owner's employment.
  4 19    The election shall apply to all subsequent sales of the

  4 21 qualified corporation and was acquired by the employee=owner
  4 22 while employed by the corporation.

  4 24 the capital stock by inter vivos gift from the employee=owner
  4 25 to a spouse or lineal descendant, or to a trust for the benefit

  4 27 election will apply to a spouse only if the spouse was married

  4 29 employee=owner's death.
  4 30    If, after making a valid inter vivos transfer of stock that
  4 31 meets all the requirements for an election, an employee=owner
  4 32 dies without making an election, the surviving spouse, or if
  4 33 there is no surviving spouse, the personal representative of
  4 34 the employee=owner's estate may make the election.
  4 35    An election is made by including a written statement
  5  1 containing certain required information, as specified in the
  5  2 bill, with the taxpayer's Iowa income tax return for the

  4 24 the capital stock by inter vivos gift from the employee=owner
  4 25 to a spouse or lineal descendant, or to a trust for the benefit

  3  5    (B)  The corporation has at least five shareholders.
  3  6    (C)  The corporation has at least two shareholders or
  3  7 groups of shareholders who are not related.  Two persons are

  3 10 capital stock that if directly owned would be attributed to the
  3 11 other person, or is the brother, sister, aunt, uncle, cousin,

  3 25                           EXPLANATION
  3 26 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  3 27 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  3 28    This bill grants an employee=owner, as defined in the
  3 29 bill, one irrevocable lifetime election to exclude from state
  3 30 individual income tax the net capital gain from the sale of the
  3 31 capital stock of one qualified corporation.
  3 32    The capital gain exclusion is phased in over a six=year
  3 33 period beginning with a 50 percent exclusion for tax years
  3 34 beginning in calendar year 2017, and increasing 10 percent each
  3 35 calendar year until the exclusion equals 100 percent for tax
  4  1 years beginning on or after January 1, 2022.
  4  2    Several requirements must be met for capital stock to
  4  3 qualify as capital stock of a qualified corporation. First,
  4  4 the stock must be either voting or nonvoting, common or
  4  5 preferred stock. Stock rights, stock warrants, stock options,
  4  6 and debt securities do not qualify. Second, the corporation
  4  7 that issued the stock must be in existence and actively doing
  4  8 business in Iowa for at least 10 years. A corporation that
  4  9 is part of an affiliated group will qualify if the affiliated
  4 10 group includes a member that has been in existence and actively
  4 11 doing business in Iowa for at least 10 years. Third, the
  4 12 corporation that issued the stock must have at least five
  4 13 shareholders, two of whom must not be related. Fourth, the
  4 14 stock must have been acquired by the employee=owner while
  4 15 employed by the corporation. A corporation will qualify
  4 16 if it is a party to a reorganization that was entirely or
  4 17 substantially tax free as long as the reorganization occurred
  4 18 during or after the employee=owner's employment.
  4 19    The election shall apply to all subsequent sales of the
  4 20 elected capital stock, provided it is capital stock in the same
  4 21 qualified corporation and was acquired by the employee=owner
  4 22 while employed by the corporation.
  4 23    The bill provides that the election applies to transfers of
  4 24 the capital stock by inter vivos gift from the employee=owner
  4 25 to a spouse or lineal descendant, or to a trust for the benefit
  4 26 of the employee=owner's spouse or lineal descendant. The
  4 27 election will apply to a spouse only if the spouse was married
  4 28 to the employee=owner on the date of the sale or the date of the
  4 29 employee=owner's death.
  4 30    If, after making a valid inter vivos transfer of stock that
  4 31 meets all the requirements for an election, an employee=owner
  4 32 dies without making an election, the surviving spouse, or if
  4 33 there is no surviving spouse, the personal representative of
  4 34 the employee=owner's estate may make the election.
  4 35    An election is made by including a written statement
  5  1 containing certain required information, as specified in the
  5  2 bill, with the taxpayer's Iowa income tax return for the
  5  3 taxable year in which the election is made.  The department of
  5  4 revenue is required to provide appropriate forms for making
  5  5 elections and reporting exclusions.
  5  6    The bill applies to tax years beginning on or after January
  5  7 1, 2017.

  2  1 stock by inter vivos gift from the employee=owner to the
  2  2 employee=owner's spouse or lineal descendants, or to a trust
  2  3 for the benefit of the employee=owner's spouse or lineal

  2 10 personal representative of the employee=owner's estate may
  2 11 make the election that would have qualified under subparagraph
  2 12 division (c).
  2 13    (e)  The election shall be made by including a written

  2 15 the taxable year in which the election is made.  The written
  2 16 statement shall identify the qualified corporation that issued

  2 18 paragraph "f", a statement that the taxpayer elects to have this
  2 19 paragraph "f" apply, and any other information required by the

  3  5    (B)  The corporation has at least five shareholders.
  3  6    (C)  The corporation has at least two shareholders or

  3 10 capital stock that if directly owned would be attributed to the
  3 11 other person, or is the brother, sister, aunt, uncle, cousin,
  3 12 niece, or nephew of the other person who owns capital stock
  3 13 either directly or indirectly.
  3 14    (ii)  A qualified corporation shall include any member

  3 25                           EXPLANATION
  3 26 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  3 27 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  3 28    This bill grants an employee=owner, as defined in the
  3 29 bill, one irrevocable lifetime election to exclude from state
  3 30 individual income tax the net capital gain from the sale of the
  3 31 capital stock of one qualified corporation.
  3 32    The capital gain exclusion is phased in over a six=year
  3 33 period beginning with a 50 percent exclusion for tax years
  3 34 beginning in calendar year 2017, and increasing 10 percent each
  3 35 calendar year until the exclusion equals 100 percent for tax
  4  1 years beginning on or after January 1, 2022.
  4  2    Several requirements must be met for capital stock to
  4  3 qualify as capital stock of a qualified corporation. First,
  4  4 the stock must be either voting or nonvoting, common or
  4  5 preferred stock. Stock rights, stock warrants, stock options,
  4  6 and debt securities do not qualify. Second, the corporation
  4  7 that issued the stock must be in existence and actively doing
  4  8 business in Iowa for at least 10 years. A corporation that
  4  9 is part of an affiliated group will qualify if the affiliated
  4 10 group includes a member that has been in existence and actively
  4 11 doing business in Iowa for at least 10 years. Third, the
  4 12 corporation that issued the stock must have at least five
  4 13 shareholders, two of whom must not be related. Fourth, the
  4 14 stock must have been acquired by the employee=owner while
  4 15 employed by the corporation. A corporation will qualify
  4 16 if it is a party to a reorganization that was entirely or
  4 17 substantially tax free as long as the reorganization occurred
  4 18 during or after the employee=owner's employment.
  4 19    The election shall apply to all subsequent sales of the
  4 20 elected capital stock, provided it is capital stock in the same
  4 21 qualified corporation and was acquired by the employee=owner
  4 22 while employed by the corporation.
  4 23    The bill provides that the election applies to transfers of
  4 24 the capital stock by inter vivos gift from the employee=owner
  4 25 to a spouse or lineal descendant, or to a trust for the benefit
  4 26 of the employee=owner's spouse or lineal descendant. The
  4 27 election will apply to a spouse only if the spouse was married
  4 28 to the employee=owner on the date of the sale or the date of the
  4 29 employee=owner's death.
  4 30    If, after making a valid inter vivos transfer of stock that
  4 31 meets all the requirements for an election, an employee=owner
  4 32 dies without making an election, the surviving spouse, or if
  4 33 there is no surviving spouse, the personal representative of
  4 34 the employee=owner's estate may make the election.
  4 35    An election is made by including a written statement
  5  1 containing certain required information, as specified in the
  5  2 bill, with the taxpayer's Iowa income tax return for the

  3 34 beginning in calendar year 2017, and increasing 10 percent each
  3 35 calendar year until the exclusion equals 100 percent for tax
  4  1 years beginning on or after January 1, 2022.
  4  2    Several requirements must be met for capital stock to
  4  3 qualify as capital stock of a qualified corporation. First,
  4  4 the stock must be either voting or nonvoting, common or
  4  5 preferred stock. Stock rights, stock warrants, stock options,
  4  6 and debt securities do not qualify. Second, the corporation
  4  7 that issued the stock must be in existence and actively doing
  4  8 business in Iowa for at least 10 years. A corporation that
  4  9 is part of an affiliated group will qualify if the affiliated
  4 10 group includes a member that has been in existence and actively
  4 11 doing business in Iowa for at least 10 years. Third, the
  4 12 corporation that issued the stock must have at least five
  4 13 shareholders, two of whom must not be related. Fourth, the
  4 14 stock must have been acquired by the employee=owner while
  4 15 employed by the corporation. A corporation will qualify
  4 16 if it is a party to a reorganization that was entirely or
  4 17 substantially tax free as long as the reorganization occurred
  4 18 during or after the employee=owner's employment.
  4 19    The election shall apply to all subsequent sales of the
  4 20 elected capital stock, provided it is capital stock in the same
  4 21 qualified corporation and was acquired by the employee=owner
  4 22 while employed by the corporation.
  4 23    The bill provides that the election applies to transfers of
  4 24 the capital stock by inter vivos gift from the employee=owner
  4 25 to a spouse or lineal descendant, or to a trust for the benefit
  4 26 of the employee=owner's spouse or lineal descendant. The
  4 27 election will apply to a spouse only if the spouse was married
  4 28 to the employee=owner on the date of the sale or the date of the
  4 29 employee=owner's death.
  4 30    If, after making a valid inter vivos transfer of stock that
  4 31 meets all the requirements for an election, an employee=owner
  4 32 dies without making an election, the surviving spouse, or if
  4 33 there is no surviving spouse, the personal representative of
  4 34 the employee=owner's estate may make the election.
  4 35    An election is made by including a written statement
  5  1 containing certain required information, as specified in the
  5  2 bill, with the taxpayer's Iowa income tax return for the
  5  3 taxable year in which the election is made.  The department of
  5  4 revenue is required to provide appropriate forms for making
  5  5 elections and reporting exclusions.
  5  6    The bill applies to tax years beginning on or after January

  3 25                           EXPLANATION
  3 26 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  3 27 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  3 28    This bill grants an employee=owner, as defined in the
  3 29 bill, one irrevocable lifetime election to exclude from state
  3 30 individual income tax the net capital gain from the sale of the
  3 31 capital stock of one qualified corporation.
  3 32    The capital gain exclusion is phased in over a six=year
  3 33 period beginning with a 50 percent exclusion for tax years
  3 34 beginning in calendar year 2017, and increasing 10 percent each
  3 35 calendar year until the exclusion equals 100 percent for tax
  4  1 years beginning on or after January 1, 2022.
  4  2    Several requirements must be met for capital stock to
  4  3 qualify as capital stock of a qualified corporation. First,
  4  4 the stock must be either voting or nonvoting, common or
  4  5 preferred stock. Stock rights, stock warrants, stock options,
  4  6 and debt securities do not qualify. Second, the corporation
  4  7 that issued the stock must be in existence and actively doing
  4  8 business in Iowa for at least 10 years. A corporation that
  4  9 is part of an affiliated group will qualify if the affiliated
  4 10 group includes a member that has been in existence and actively
  4 11 doing business in Iowa for at least 10 years. Third, the
  4 12 corporation that issued the stock must have at least five
  4 13 shareholders, two of whom must not be related. Fourth, the
  4 14 stock must have been acquired by the employee=owner while
  4 15 employed by the corporation. A corporation will qualify
  4 16 if it is a party to a reorganization that was entirely or
  4 17 substantially tax free as long as the reorganization occurred
  4 18 during or after the employee=owner's employment.
  4 19    The election shall apply to all subsequent sales of the
  4 20 elected capital stock, provided it is capital stock in the same
  4 21 qualified corporation and was acquired by the employee=owner
  4 22 while employed by the corporation.
  4 23    The bill provides that the election applies to transfers of
  4 24 the capital stock by inter vivos gift from the employee=owner
  4 25 to a spouse or lineal descendant, or to a trust for the benefit
  4 26 of the employee=owner's spouse or lineal descendant. The
  4 27 election will apply to a spouse only if the spouse was married
  4 28 to the employee=owner on the date of the sale or the date of the
  4 29 employee=owner's death.
  4 30    If, after making a valid inter vivos transfer of stock that
  4 31 meets all the requirements for an election, an employee=owner
  4 32 dies without making an election, the surviving spouse, or if
  4 33 there is no surviving spouse, the personal representative of
  4 34 the employee=owner's estate may make the election.
  4 35    An election is made by including a written statement
  5  1 containing certain required information, as specified in the
  5  2 bill, with the taxpayer's Iowa income tax return for the
  5  3 taxable year in which the election is made.  The department of
  5  4 revenue is required to provide appropriate forms for making
  5  5 elections and reporting exclusions.

  2  9 the surviving spouse or, if there is no surviving spouse, the
  2 10 personal representative of the employee=owner's estate may
  2 11 make the election that would have qualified under subparagraph
  2 12 division (c).
  2 13    (e)  The election shall be made by including a written

  2 15 the taxable year in which the election is made.  The written
  2 16 statement shall identify the qualified corporation that issued
  2 17 the capital stock, the grounds for the election under this
  2 18 paragraph "f", a statement that the taxpayer elects to have this
  2 19 paragraph "f" apply, and any other information required by the

  3 10 capital stock that if directly owned would be attributed to the
  3 11 other person, or is the brother, sister, aunt, uncle, cousin,

  3 29 bill, one irrevocable lifetime election to exclude from state
  3 30 individual income tax the net capital gain from the sale of the
  3 31 capital stock of one qualified corporation.
  3 32    The capital gain exclusion is phased in over a six=year
  3 33 period beginning with a 50 percent exclusion for tax years
  3 34 beginning in calendar year 2017, and increasing 10 percent each
  3 35 calendar year until the exclusion equals 100 percent for tax
  4  1 years beginning on or after January 1, 2022.
  4  2    Several requirements must be met for capital stock to
  4  3 qualify as capital stock of a qualified corporation. First,
  4  4 the stock must be either voting or nonvoting, common or
  4  5 preferred stock. Stock rights, stock warrants, stock options,
  4  6 and debt securities do not qualify. Second, the corporation
  4  7 that issued the stock must be in existence and actively doing
  4  8 business in Iowa for at least 10 years. A corporation that
  4  9 is part of an affiliated group will qualify if the affiliated
  4 10 group includes a member that has been in existence and actively

  4 13 shareholders, two of whom must not be related. Fourth, the
  4 14 stock must have been acquired by the employee=owner while
  4 15 employed by the corporation. A corporation will qualify
  4 16 if it is a party to a reorganization that was entirely or
  4 17 substantially tax free as long as the reorganization occurred
  4 18 during or after the employee=owner's employment.
  4 19    The election shall apply to all subsequent sales of the
  4 20 elected capital stock, provided it is capital stock in the same
  4 21 qualified corporation and was acquired by the employee=owner
  4 22 while employed by the corporation.
  4 23    The bill provides that the election applies to transfers of
  4 24 the capital stock by inter vivos gift from the employee=owner
  4 25 to a spouse or lineal descendant, or to a trust for the benefit
  4 26 of the employee=owner's spouse or lineal descendant. The
  4 27 election will apply to a spouse only if the spouse was married
  4 28 to the employee=owner on the date of the sale or the date of the
  4 29 employee=owner's death.
  4 30    If, after making a valid inter vivos transfer of stock that
  4 31 meets all the requirements for an election, an employee=owner
  4 32 dies without making an election, the surviving spouse, or if
  4 33 there is no surviving spouse, the personal representative of
  4 34 the employee=owner's estate may make the election.
  4 35    An election is made by including a written statement
  5  1 containing certain required information, as specified in the
  5  2 bill, with the taxpayer's Iowa income tax return for the

  3 29 bill, one irrevocable lifetime election to exclude from state
  3 30 individual income tax the net capital gain from the sale of the
  3 31 capital stock of one qualified corporation.
  3 32    The capital gain exclusion is phased in over a six=year
  3 33 period beginning with a 50 percent exclusion for tax years
  3 34 beginning in calendar year 2017, and increasing 10 percent each

  4  1 years beginning on or after January 1, 2022.
  4  2    Several requirements must be met for capital stock to
  4  3 qualify as capital stock of a qualified corporation. First,
  4  4 the stock must be either voting or nonvoting, common or
  4  5 preferred stock. Stock rights, stock warrants, stock options,
  4  6 and debt securities do not qualify. Second, the corporation
  4  7 that issued the stock must be in existence and actively doing
  4  8 business in Iowa for at least 10 years. A corporation that

  4 13 shareholders, two of whom must not be related. Fourth, the
  4 14 stock must have been acquired by the employee=owner while

  4 16 if it is a party to a reorganization that was entirely or
  4 17 substantially tax free as long as the reorganization occurred
  4 18 during or after the employee=owner's employment.
  4 19    The election shall apply to all subsequent sales of the
  4 20 elected capital stock, provided it is capital stock in the same
  4 21 qualified corporation and was acquired by the employee=owner
  4 22 while employed by the corporation.
  4 23    The bill provides that the election applies to transfers of
  4 24 the capital stock by inter vivos gift from the employee=owner
  4 25 to a spouse or lineal descendant, or to a trust for the benefit
  4 26 of the employee=owner's spouse or lineal descendant. The
  4 27 election will apply to a spouse only if the spouse was married
  4 28 to the employee=owner on the date of the sale or the date of the

  3 28    This bill grants an employee=owner, as defined in the
  3 29 bill, one irrevocable lifetime election to exclude from state
  3 30 individual income tax the net capital gain from the sale of the
  3 31 capital stock of one qualified corporation.
  3 32    The capital gain exclusion is phased in over a six=year
  3 33 period beginning with a 50 percent exclusion for tax years
  3 34 beginning in calendar year 2017, and increasing 10 percent each

  4  4 the stock must be either voting or nonvoting, common or
  4  5 preferred stock. Stock rights, stock warrants, stock options,
  4  6 and debt securities do not qualify. Second, the corporation
  4  7 that issued the stock must be in existence and actively doing
  4  8 business in Iowa for at least 10 years. A corporation that
  4  9 is part of an affiliated group will qualify if the affiliated
  4 10 group includes a member that has been in existence and actively

  4 16 if it is a party to a reorganization that was entirely or
  4 17 substantially tax free as long as the reorganization occurred
  4 18 during or after the employee=owner's employment.
  4 19    The election shall apply to all subsequent sales of the
  4 20 elected capital stock, provided it is capital stock in the same
  4 21 qualified corporation and was acquired by the employee=owner
  4 22 while employed by the corporation.
  4 23    The bill provides that the election applies to transfers of
  4 24 the capital stock by inter vivos gift from the employee=owner
  4 25 to a spouse or lineal descendant, or to a trust for the benefit
  4 26 of the employee=owner's spouse or lineal descendant. The
  4 27 election will apply to a spouse only if the spouse was married
  4 28 to the employee=owner on the date of the sale or the date of the
  4 29 employee=owner's death.

  3  5    (B)  The corporation has at least five shareholders.

  3  9 Revenue Code, one is a person who owns, directly or indirectly,
  3 10 capital stock that if directly owned would be attributed to the
  3 11 other person, or is the brother, sister, aunt, uncle, cousin,

  3 26 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  3 27 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  3 28    This bill grants an employee=owner, as defined in the
  3 29 bill, one irrevocable lifetime election to exclude from state
  3 30 individual income tax the net capital gain from the sale of the
  3 31 capital stock of one qualified corporation.
  3 32    The capital gain exclusion is phased in over a six=year
  3 33 period beginning with a 50 percent exclusion for tax years
  3 34 beginning in calendar year 2017, and increasing 10 percent each
  3 35 calendar year until the exclusion equals 100 percent for tax
  4  1 years beginning on or after January 1, 2022.
  4  2    Several requirements must be met for capital stock to
  4  3 qualify as capital stock of a qualified corporation. First,
  4  4 the stock must be either voting or nonvoting, common or
  4  5 preferred stock. Stock rights, stock warrants, stock options,
  4  6 and debt securities do not qualify. Second, the corporation
  4  7 that issued the stock must be in existence and actively doing
  4  8 business in Iowa for at least 10 years. A corporation that
  4  9 is part of an affiliated group will qualify if the affiliated
  4 10 group includes a member that has been in existence and actively
  4 11 doing business in Iowa for at least 10 years. Third, the
  4 12 corporation that issued the stock must have at least five
  4 13 shareholders, two of whom must not be related. Fourth, the
  4 14 stock must have been acquired by the employee=owner while
  4 15 employed by the corporation. A corporation will qualify
  4 16 if it is a party to a reorganization that was entirely or
  4 17 substantially tax free as long as the reorganization occurred
  4 18 during or after the employee=owner's employment.
  4 19    The election shall apply to all subsequent sales of the
  4 20 elected capital stock, provided it is capital stock in the same
  4 21 qualified corporation and was acquired by the employee=owner
  4 22 while employed by the corporation.
  4 23    The bill provides that the election applies to transfers of
  4 24 the capital stock by inter vivos gift from the employee=owner
  4 25 to a spouse or lineal descendant, or to a trust for the benefit
  4 26 of the employee=owner's spouse or lineal descendant. The
  4 27 election will apply to a spouse only if the spouse was married
  4 28 to the employee=owner on the date of the sale or the date of the
  4 29 employee=owner's death.
  4 30    If, after making a valid inter vivos transfer of stock that
  4 31 meets all the requirements for an election, an employee=owner
  4 32 dies without making an election, the surviving spouse, or if
  4 33 there is no surviving spouse, the personal representative of
  4 34 the employee=owner's estate may make the election.
  4 35    An election is made by including a written statement
  5  1 containing certain required information, as specified in the
  5  2 bill, with the taxpayer's Iowa income tax return for the
  5  3 taxable year in which the election is made.  The department of
  5  4 revenue is required to provide appropriate forms for making
  5  5 elections and reporting exclusions.
  5  6    The bill applies to tax years beginning on or after January
  5  7 1, 2017.

  3 28    This bill grants an employee=owner, as defined in the
  3 29 bill, one irrevocable lifetime election to exclude from state
  3 30 individual income tax the net capital gain from the sale of the
  3 31 capital stock of one qualified corporation.
  3 32    The capital gain exclusion is phased in over a six=year
  3 33 period beginning with a 50 percent exclusion for tax years
  3 34 beginning in calendar year 2017, and increasing 10 percent each
  3 35 calendar year until the exclusion equals 100 percent for tax
  4  1 years beginning on or after January 1, 2022.
  4  2    Several requirements must be met for capital stock to
  4  3 qualify as capital stock of a qualified corporation. First,
  4  4 the stock must be either voting or nonvoting, common or
  4  5 preferred stock. Stock rights, stock warrants, stock options,
  4  6 and debt securities do not qualify. Second, the corporation
  4  7 that issued the stock must be in existence and actively doing
  4  8 business in Iowa for at least 10 years. A corporation that
  4  9 is part of an affiliated group will qualify if the affiliated
  4 10 group includes a member that has been in existence and actively
  4 11 doing business in Iowa for at least 10 years. Third, the
  4 12 corporation that issued the stock must have at least five
  4 13 shareholders, two of whom must not be related. Fourth, the
  4 14 stock must have been acquired by the employee=owner while
  4 15 employed by the corporation. A corporation will qualify
  4 16 if it is a party to a reorganization that was entirely or
  4 17 substantially tax free as long as the reorganization occurred
  4 18 during or after the employee=owner's employment.
  4 19    The election shall apply to all subsequent sales of the
  4 20 elected capital stock, provided it is capital stock in the same
  4 21 qualified corporation and was acquired by the employee=owner
  4 22 while employed by the corporation.
  4 23    The bill provides that the election applies to transfers of
  4 24 the capital stock by inter vivos gift from the employee=owner
  4 25 to a spouse or lineal descendant, or to a trust for the benefit
  4 26 of the employee=owner's spouse or lineal descendant. The
  4 27 election will apply to a spouse only if the spouse was married
  4 28 to the employee=owner on the date of the sale or the date of the
  4 29 employee=owner's death.
  4 30    If, after making a valid inter vivos transfer of stock that
  4 31 meets all the requirements for an election, an employee=owner
  4 32 dies without making an election, the surviving spouse, or if
  4 33 there is no surviving spouse, the personal representative of
  4 34 the employee=owner's estate may make the election.
  4 35    An election is made by including a written statement
  5  1 containing certain required information, as specified in the
  5  2 bill, with the taxpayer's Iowa income tax return for the
  5  3 taxable year in which the election is made.  The department of
  5  4 revenue is required to provide appropriate forms for making
  5  5 elections and reporting exclusions.
  5  6    The bill applies to tax years beginning on or after January
  5  7 1, 2017.

  3  5    (B)  The corporation has at least five shareholders.
  3  6    (C)  The corporation has at least two shareholders or

  3 10 capital stock that if directly owned would be attributed to the
  3 11 other person, or is the brother, sister, aunt, uncle, cousin,

  3 25                           EXPLANATION
  3 26 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  3 27 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  3 28    This bill grants an employee=owner, as defined in the
  3 29 bill, one irrevocable lifetime election to exclude from state
  3 30 individual income tax the net capital gain from the sale of the
  3 31 capital stock of one qualified corporation.
  3 32    The capital gain exclusion is phased in over a six=year
  3 33 period beginning with a 50 percent exclusion for tax years
  3 34 beginning in calendar year 2017, and increasing 10 percent each
  3 35 calendar year until the exclusion equals 100 percent for tax
  4  1 years beginning on or after January 1, 2022.
  4  2    Several requirements must be met for capital stock to
  4  3 qualify as capital stock of a qualified corporation. First,
  4  4 the stock must be either voting or nonvoting, common or
  4  5 preferred stock. Stock rights, stock warrants, stock options,
  4  6 and debt securities do not qualify. Second, the corporation
  4  7 that issued the stock must be in existence and actively doing
  4  8 business in Iowa for at least 10 years. A corporation that
  4  9 is part of an affiliated group will qualify if the affiliated
  4 10 group includes a member that has been in existence and actively
  4 11 doing business in Iowa for at least 10 years. Third, the
  4 12 corporation that issued the stock must have at least five
  4 13 shareholders, two of whom must not be related. Fourth, the
  4 14 stock must have been acquired by the employee=owner while
  4 15 employed by the corporation. A corporation will qualify
  4 16 if it is a party to a reorganization that was entirely or
  4 17 substantially tax free as long as the reorganization occurred
  4 18 during or after the employee=owner's employment.
  4 19    The election shall apply to all subsequent sales of the
  4 20 elected capital stock, provided it is capital stock in the same
  4 21 qualified corporation and was acquired by the employee=owner
  4 22 while employed by the corporation.
  4 23    The bill provides that the election applies to transfers of
  4 24 the capital stock by inter vivos gift from the employee=owner
  4 25 to a spouse or lineal descendant, or to a trust for the benefit
  4 26 of the employee=owner's spouse or lineal descendant. The
  4 27 election will apply to a spouse only if the spouse was married
  4 28 to the employee=owner on the date of the sale or the date of the
  4 29 employee=owner's death.
  4 30    If, after making a valid inter vivos transfer of stock that
  4 31 meets all the requirements for an election, an employee=owner
  4 32 dies without making an election, the surviving spouse, or if
  4 33 there is no surviving spouse, the personal representative of
  4 34 the employee=owner's estate may make the election.
  4 35    An election is made by including a written statement
  5  1 containing certain required information, as specified in the
  5  2 bill, with the taxpayer's Iowa income tax return for the
  5  3 taxable year in which the election is made.  The department of
  5  4 revenue is required to provide appropriate forms for making
  5  5 elections and reporting exclusions.

  3 35 calendar year until the exclusion equals 100 percent for tax
  4  1 years beginning on or after January 1, 2022.
  4  2    Several requirements must be met for capital stock to
  4  3 qualify as capital stock of a qualified corporation. First,
  4  4 the stock must be either voting or nonvoting, common or
  4  5 preferred stock. Stock rights, stock warrants, stock options,
  4  6 and debt securities do not qualify. Second, the corporation
  4  7 that issued the stock must be in existence and actively doing
  4  8 business in Iowa for at least 10 years. A corporation that
  4  9 is part of an affiliated group will qualify if the affiliated
  4 10 group includes a member that has been in existence and actively
  4 11 doing business in Iowa for at least 10 years. Third, the
  4 12 corporation that issued the stock must have at least five
  4 13 shareholders, two of whom must not be related. Fourth, the
  4 14 stock must have been acquired by the employee=owner while
  4 15 employed by the corporation. A corporation will qualify
  4 16 if it is a party to a reorganization that was entirely or
  4 17 substantially tax free as long as the reorganization occurred
  4 18 during or after the employee=owner's employment.
  4 19    The election shall apply to all subsequent sales of the
  4 20 elected capital stock, provided it is capital stock in the same
  4 21 qualified corporation and was acquired by the employee=owner
  4 22 while employed by the corporation.
  4 23    The bill provides that the election applies to transfers of
  4 24 the capital stock by inter vivos gift from the employee=owner
  4 25 to a spouse or lineal descendant, or to a trust for the benefit
  4 26 of the employee=owner's spouse or lineal descendant. The
  4 27 election will apply to a spouse only if the spouse was married
  4 28 to the employee=owner on the date of the sale or the date of the
  4 29 employee=owner's death.
  4 30    If, after making a valid inter vivos transfer of stock that
  4 31 meets all the requirements for an election, an employee=owner
  4 32 dies without making an election, the surviving spouse, or if
  4 33 there is no surviving spouse, the personal representative of
  4 34 the employee=owner's estate may make the election.

  2 34    (d)  (i)  "Qualified corporation" means a corporation
  2 35 which, at the time of the first sale or exchange for which an
  3  1 election is made under this paragraph "f", meets the following
  3  2 conditions:
  3  3    (A)  The corporation has been in existence and actively doing
  3  4 business in this state for at least ten years.
  3  5    (B)  The corporation has at least five shareholders.
  3  6    (C)  The corporation has at least two shareholders or
  3  7 groups of shareholders who are not related.  Two persons are
  3  8 considered related when, under section 318 of the Internal
  3  9 Revenue Code, one is a person who owns, directly or indirectly,
  3 10 capital stock that if directly owned would be attributed to the
  3 11 other person, or is the brother, sister, aunt, uncle, cousin,
  3 12 niece, or nephew of the other person who owns capital stock
  3 13 either directly or indirectly.
  3 14    (ii)  A qualified corporation shall include any member
  3 15 of an affiliated group, as defined in section 422.32, if the
  3 16 affiliated group includes a member that has been in existence
  3 17 and actively doing business in this state for at least ten
  3 18 years.
  3 19    (iii)  A qualified corporation shall include any corporation
  3 20 that was a party to a reorganization that was entirely or
  3 21 substantially tax free if such reorganization occurred during
  3 22 or after the employment of the employee=owner.
  3 23    Sec. 3.  APPLICABILITY.  This Act applies to tax years
  3 24 beginning on or after January 1, 2017.

  3 26 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  3 27 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  3 28    This bill grants an employee=owner, as defined in the
  3 29 bill, one irrevocable lifetime election to exclude from state
  3 30 individual income tax the net capital gain from the sale of the
  3 31 capital stock of one qualified corporation.
  3 32    The capital gain exclusion is phased in over a six=year
  3 33 period beginning with a 50 percent exclusion for tax years
  3 34 beginning in calendar year 2017, and increasing 10 percent each
  3 35 calendar year until the exclusion equals 100 percent for tax
  4  1 years beginning on or after January 1, 2022.
  4  2    Several requirements must be met for capital stock to
  4  3 qualify as capital stock of a qualified corporation. First,
  4  4 the stock must be either voting or nonvoting, common or
  4  5 preferred stock. Stock rights, stock warrants, stock options,
  4  6 and debt securities do not qualify. Second, the corporation
  4  7 that issued the stock must be in existence and actively doing
  4  8 business in Iowa for at least 10 years. A corporation that
  4  9 is part of an affiliated group will qualify if the affiliated
  4 10 group includes a member that has been in existence and actively
  4 11 doing business in Iowa for at least 10 years. Third, the
  4 12 corporation that issued the stock must have at least five
  4 13 shareholders, two of whom must not be related. Fourth, the
  4 14 stock must have been acquired by the employee=owner while
  4 15 employed by the corporation. A corporation will qualify
  4 16 if it is a party to a reorganization that was entirely or
  4 17 substantially tax free as long as the reorganization occurred
  4 18 during or after the employee=owner's employment.
  4 19    The election shall apply to all subsequent sales of the
  4 20 elected capital stock, provided it is capital stock in the same
  4 21 qualified corporation and was acquired by the employee=owner
  4 22 while employed by the corporation.
  4 23    The bill provides that the election applies to transfers of
  4 24 the capital stock by inter vivos gift from the employee=owner
  4 25 to a spouse or lineal descendant, or to a trust for the benefit
  4 26 of the employee=owner's spouse or lineal descendant. The
  4 27 election will apply to a spouse only if the spouse was married
  4 28 to the employee=owner on the date of the sale or the date of the
  4 29 employee=owner's death.
  4 30    If, after making a valid inter vivos transfer of stock that
  4 31 meets all the requirements for an election, an employee=owner
  4 32 dies without making an election, the surviving spouse, or if
  4 33 there is no surviving spouse, the personal representative of
  4 34 the employee=owner's estate may make the election.
  4 35    An election is made by including a written statement
  5  1 containing certain required information, as specified in the

  3 28    This bill grants an employee=owner, as defined in the
  3 29 bill, one irrevocable lifetime election to exclude from state
  3 30 individual income tax the net capital gain from the sale of the
  3 31 capital stock of one qualified corporation.
  3 32    The capital gain exclusion is phased in over a six=year
  3 33 period beginning with a 50 percent exclusion for tax years
  3 34 beginning in calendar year 2017, and increasing 10 percent each
  3 35 calendar year until the exclusion equals 100 percent for tax
  4  1 years beginning on or after January 1, 2022.
  4  2    Several requirements must be met for capital stock to
  4  3 qualify as capital stock of a qualified corporation. First,
  4  4 the stock must be either voting or nonvoting, common or
  4  5 preferred stock. Stock rights, stock warrants, stock options,
  4  6 and debt securities do not qualify. Second, the corporation
  4  7 that issued the stock must be in existence and actively doing
  4  8 business in Iowa for at least 10 years. A corporation that
  4  9 is part of an affiliated group will qualify if the affiliated
  4 10 group includes a member that has been in existence and actively
  4 11 doing business in Iowa for at least 10 years. Third, the
  4 12 corporation that issued the stock must have at least five
  4 13 shareholders, two of whom must not be related. Fourth, the
  4 14 stock must have been acquired by the employee=owner while
  4 15 employed by the corporation. A corporation will qualify
  4 16 if it is a party to a reorganization that was entirely or
  4 17 substantially tax free as long as the reorganization occurred
  4 18 during or after the employee=owner's employment.
  4 19    The election shall apply to all subsequent sales of the
  4 20 elected capital stock, provided it is capital stock in the same
  4 21 qualified corporation and was acquired by the employee=owner
  4 22 while employed by the corporation.
  4 23    The bill provides that the election applies to transfers of
  4 24 the capital stock by inter vivos gift from the employee=owner
  4 25 to a spouse or lineal descendant, or to a trust for the benefit
  4 26 of the employee=owner's spouse or lineal descendant. The
  4 27 election will apply to a spouse only if the spouse was married
  4 28 to the employee=owner on the date of the sale or the date of the
  4 29 employee=owner's death.
  4 30    If, after making a valid inter vivos transfer of stock that
  4 31 meets all the requirements for an election, an employee=owner
  4 32 dies without making an election, the surviving spouse, or if
  4 33 there is no surviving spouse, the personal representative of
  4 34 the employee=owner's estate may make the election.
  4 35    An election is made by including a written statement
  5  1 containing certain required information, as specified in the
  5  2 bill, with the taxpayer's Iowa income tax return for the
  5  3 taxable year in which the election is made.  The department of

  3 28    This bill grants an employee=owner, as defined in the
  3 29 bill, one irrevocable lifetime election to exclude from state
  3 30 individual income tax the net capital gain from the sale of the
  3 31 capital stock of one qualified corporation.
  3 32    The capital gain exclusion is phased in over a six=year
  3 33 period beginning with a 50 percent exclusion for tax years
  3 34 beginning in calendar year 2017, and increasing 10 percent each
  3 35 calendar year until the exclusion equals 100 percent for tax
  4  1 years beginning on or after January 1, 2022.
  4  2    Several requirements must be met for capital stock to
  4  3 qualify as capital stock of a qualified corporation. First,
  4  4 the stock must be either voting or nonvoting, common or
  4  5 preferred stock. Stock rights, stock warrants, stock options,
  4  6 and debt securities do not qualify. Second, the corporation
  4  7 that issued the stock must be in existence and actively doing
  4  8 business in Iowa for at least 10 years. A corporation that
  4  9 is part of an affiliated group will qualify if the affiliated

  4 16 if it is a party to a reorganization that was entirely or
  4 17 substantially tax free as long as the reorganization occurred
  4 18 during or after the employee=owner's employment.
  4 19    The election shall apply to all subsequent sales of the
  4 20 elected capital stock, provided it is capital stock in the same
  4 21 qualified corporation and was acquired by the employee=owner
  4 22 while employed by the corporation.
  4 23    The bill provides that the election applies to transfers of
  4 24 the capital stock by inter vivos gift from the employee=owner

  4  6 and debt securities do not qualify. Second, the corporation
  4  7 that issued the stock must be in existence and actively doing
  4  8 business in Iowa for at least 10 years. A corporation that
