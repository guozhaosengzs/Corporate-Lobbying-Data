  2 24    Under current law, special trucks for farm use may be

  2 26 pounds. Code section 321.466 provides that the gross weight of

  2 28 be exceeded by up to 25 percent. As a result, under certain
  2 29 circumstances, the maximum gross weight allowed for special
  2 30 trucks for farm use is 80,000 pounds.
  2 31    This bill provides that special trucks for farm use may be
