To

the

may

1.
The

finds
that:
32


a.
Between
ten
and
twenty
percent
of
Iowans
have
a
33


disability
that

participate
in

These
disabilities
1


are
the
result
of
genetics,
environmental
factors,
injury,
or
2


illness;
may
occur
at
any
point
in
life;
may
be
mild,
severe,
3


or
intermittent;
and
are
often
very
costly
for

affected,
their
families,
and
government
both
in
terms
of

quality
of

b.
Most
disabilities
are
due
to
conditions
that
can
be
7


prevented,
can
be
minimized
if
recognized
and
treated
early,
or
8


can
be
reduced
through

to
establish

a

to
identify

to
enhance
15

The

for
4


the
purpose
of

(state

that
will

of
§529A

the

and
has
numerous
powers,
20


as
specified

The

2016,
with

(council)

2


to
assist
the

in
determining
3


priorities
and
establishing
policies
for
the
prevention
of
4


disabilities.

The

The

a

disability
from
12


occurring;
that
identify
a
disability
or
a
condition
that
leads

to
a

can
eliminate
14


the
risk
of
a
disability

minimize
the
disability’s
effect;
15


or
that
reduce
the
effects
of
a
disability
on
an

16


health
and
independence.
The

amends
the
definition
