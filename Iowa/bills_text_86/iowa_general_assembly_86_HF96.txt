 14 12 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
 14 13 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
 14 14    This bill provides for the regulation of transportation
 14 15 network companies (TNCs).
 14 16    The bill defines a TNC as a person or entity that provides
 14 17 prearranged transportation services for compensation using
 14 18 an online=enabled application or platform to connect riders
 14 19 with drivers. It does not include a motor carrier, a
 14 20 private carrier, a charter carrier, a common carrier, a
 14 21 taxicab service, a transportation service arranged through
 14 22 a transportation broker, a ridesharing arrangement, a
 14 23 transportation service provided over fixed routes at regular
 14 24 intervals, or a political subdivision. A TNC is not required
 14 25 to own, control, operate, or manage a motor vehicle operated
 14 26 by a participating driver. The bill defines "participating
 14 27 driver" as a person who operates a motor vehicle in connection
 14 28 with a TNC's online=enabled application or platform to offer
 14 29 or provide riders with TNC services. A participating driver
 14 30 is not required to be an employee of a TNC.  The bill further
 14 31 defines "local authority", "transportation network company
 14 32 insurance", "transportation network company rider", and
 14 33 "transportation network company services".
 14 34    The bill provides local authorities with limited regulatory
 14 35 power over TNCs and drivers. A local authority may enact
 15  1 ordinances consistent with the bill, including but not
 15  2 limited to ordinances related to permits, penalties, safety
 15  3 requirements, and proof of financial liability coverage. The
 15  4 bill permits local authorities to issue a permit to a TNC if
 15  5 the TNC satisfies the requirements of the bill and pays an
 15  6 annual fee.
 15  7    The bill requires TNCs and drivers to carry certain amounts
 15  8 of liability coverage specifically related to providing TNC
 15  9 services. TNCs and drivers must file proof of the required
 15 10 coverage with the applicable local authority. Where the TNC
 15 11 insurance maintained by a driver to satisfy the requirements
 15 12 of the bill lapses, is canceled, or ceases to exist for any
 15 13 reason, the TNC is required to maintain coverage in the amounts
 15 14 required by the bill. The bill provides for various terms,
 15 15 conditions, and duties of the parties relating to TNC insurance
 15 16 coverage. Drivers are required to carry proof of TNC insurance
 15 17 coverage at all times during which the driver is operating
 15 18 a motor vehicle in connection with a TNC's online=enabled
 15 19 application or platform.
 15 20    Before a driver can provide TNC services, the bill requires
 15 21 the driver's vehicle to pass a safety inspection conducted by
 15 22 a certified mechanic. After the initial inspection, annual
 15 23 safety inspections are required. A TNC must retain an accurate
 15 24 safety inspection record for the motor vehicle of a driver for
 15 25 at least 14 months after the safety inspection was conducted.
 15 26 A motor vehicle providing TNC services is required to display
 15 27 an exterior mark designating the vehicle as a vehicle eligible
 15 28 to provide TNC services.
 15 29    To become a driver, the bill requires that a person must
 15 30 be at least 21 years of age, possess a valid Iowa driver's
 15 31 license, possess a valid proof of financial liability coverage
 15 32 card, possess a valid Iowa registration, and, after October 1,
 15 33 2015, possess proof that the person is medically fit to drive.
 15 34 Persons with various moving violations or criminal convictions
 15 35 are excluded from eligibility. A TNC must perform a driving
 16  1 history check every three years, and a criminal background
 16  2 check every five years. A TNC must retain an accurate driving
 16  3 history report for a driver for at least three years after the
 16  4 last time the driver logged on to the TNC's online=enabled
 16  5 application or platform, and an accurate criminal history
 16  6 record for a driver for at least five years after the criminal
 16  7 history background check was performed.
 16  8    The bill prohibits a driver from soliciting or accepting
 16  9 "street hails". A driver is also prohibited from offering
 16 10 services for more than 16 hours, or providing services for more
 16 11 than 12 hours, in any one 24=hour period. The bill requires
 16 12 a TNC to implement a policy prohibiting the use of drugs or
 16 13 alcohol by a driver while the driver is logged on to the TNC's
 16 14 online=enabled application or platform, or while the driver is
 16 15 providing services. The TNC is required to make the policy
 16 16 available on its internet site and online=enabled application
 16 17 or platform.
 16 18    The bill further requires a TNC to disclose certain
 16 19 information to drivers, including the amounts and terms of
 16 20 liability coverage provided by the TNC to the driver while the
 16 21 driver operates a motor vehicle in connection with the TNC's
 16 22 online=enabled application or platform, and the fact that
 16 23 the driver's personal motor vehicle liability policy may not
 16 24 provide coverage when the driver operates a motor vehicle in
 16 25 connection with a TNC's online=enabled application or platform.
 16 26 If a driver's motor vehicle has a lien against it, the driver
 16 27 must notify the lienholder that the driver is operating the
 16 28 vehicle in connection with a TNC's online=enabled application
 16 29 or platform.
 16 30    The bill also requires TNCs to make available the method
 16 31 of calculating fares, and the option to receive an estimated
 16 32 fare. After a ride, a TNC must submit an electronic receipt to
 16 33 the rider. In addition, a TNC must make available to riders
 16 34 a customer support telephone number on its internet site and
 16 35 online=enabled application or platform.
 17  1 The bill provides that TNCs and drivers shall provide
 17  2 services to riders in a nondiscriminatory manner. The bill
 17  3 further provides that a driver may only refuse service to a
 17  4 rider if the rider is acting in an unlawful, disorderly, or
 17  5 dangerous manner, the rider is unable to care for himself or
 17  6 herself and is not in the care of a responsible companion,
 17  7 or the driver has already committed to providing services to
 17  8 another rider. The bill requires a driver to immediately
 17  9 report to the TNC the driver's refusal to provide services to
 17 10 a rider. The bill prohibits a TNC from imposing additional
 17 11 fares, rates, or fees on a rider with a physical or mental
 17 12 disability because of the rider's disability. The bill also
 17 13 requires a driver to permit a service dog or assistive animal
 17 14 to accompany a rider on a prearranged ride. The bill provides
 17 15 that a local authority may assess a civil penalty of up to $550
 17 16 to a TNC or driver for a violation of these provisions.
 17 17    The bill excludes TNCs and drivers from various definitions
 17 18 and requirements relating to the transportation of passengers
 17 19 for hire that appear elsewhere in the Code.
