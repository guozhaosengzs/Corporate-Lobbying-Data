  6 35    3.  a.  The credit shall be an amount equal to the taxpayer's

  7 19 January 1, 2017, and ending on or before December 31, 2025:
  7 20    1.  The section of this Act enacting section 422.10A.
  7 21                           EXPLANATION
  7 22 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  7 23 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  7 24    This bill relates to economic development by creating rural
  7 25 opportunity zones within this state, a student loan repayment
  7 26 program and fund, and an individual income tax credit.
  7 27    RURAL OPPORTUNITY ZONES.  The bill provides that the
  7 28 economic development authority (authority) shall designate
  7 29 counties of this state as rural opportunity zones if they meet
  7 30 certain criteria specified in the bill.  A county may apply to
  7 31 the authority for designation as a rural opportunity zone, but
  7 32 application is not required for designation by the authority.
  7 33 Once designated as a rural opportunity zone, a county may lose
  7 34 its designation if events subsequent to its designation cause
  7 35 it to no longer meet the specified criteria.  However, a county
  8  1 shall not lose its designation as a rural opportunity zone
  8  2 during the county's participation in the student loan repayment
  8  3 program described in the bill.  The authority is required to
  8  4 review the eligibility of each county in this state as a rural
  8  5 opportunity zone at least annually.
  8  6    A county is eligible to be designated as a rural opportunity
  8  7 zone if it meets at least two of nine criteria specified in
  8  8 the bill relating to per capita income, average weekly wages,
  8  9 family poverty rate, population loss, aging population, housing
  8 10 vacancies, property valuations, or recent business closures or
  8 11 permanent layoffs.
  8 12    Rural opportunity zone designations are repealed July 1,
  8 13 2027.
  8 14    STUDENT LOAN REPAYMENT PROGRAM.  The bill creates a student
  8 15 loan repayment program within the authority for the purpose of
  8 16 providing student loan repayment assistance on the outstanding
  8 17 student loan debt of certain individuals.  The program consists
  8 18 of a county component for each participating county and a
  8 19 matching component of the state. Qualifying individuals may
  8 20 enroll in both the county component and the matching component
  8 21 of the student loan repayment program.
  8 22    Each county designated by the authority as a rural
  8 23 opportunity zone is eligible to create and implement a
  8 24 county component within the student loan repayment program.
  8 25 Each county component is required to contain uniform terms
  8 26 and conditions prescribed by the authority and shall have
  8 27 certain minimum qualifications.  First, the county component
  8 28 shall apply only to resident individuals who have earned
  8 29 an associate, bachelor, or postgraduate degree, who have
  8 30 outstanding student loan debt, and who establish domicile in
  8 31 that county on or after the county creates the county component
  8 32 of the program, and prior to July 1, 2021.  Second, the county
  8 33 component shall provide that participating individuals are
  8 34 entitled to full participation in the county component for five
  8 35 years, provided the participating individual remains domiciled
  9  1 within that county for the entire five=year period. Third,
  9  2 the county component shall agree to repay, subject to matching
  9  3 payments by the authority over a five=year period, the lesser
  9  4 of 10 percent of the outstanding student loan debt of the
  9  5 participating individual, or $7,500 of the outstanding student
  9  6 loan debt of the participating individual.  A participating
  9  7 individual must remain domiciled in the applicable county for
  9  8 the entirety of a calendar year to receive repayment assistance
  9  9 for that year.  After a county creates and implements its
  9 10 county component, it is required to provide a duly adopted
  9 11 resolution to the authority by January 1, 2017.  The resolution
  9 12 shall be irrevocable and shall obligate the county to
  9 13 participate in the program for a period of five years per
  9 14 individual.
  9 15    Participating individuals who remain domiciled in that
  9 16 county are eligible to receive repayment assistance from
  9 17 the county component.  In addition, the authority, through
  9 18 the matching component, shall match each payment made under
  9 19 the county component up to the lesser of 10 percent of the
  9 20 outstanding student loan debt, or $7,500 of the outstanding
  9 21 student loan debt.  The maximum amount of repayment assistance
  9 22 that an individual may receive under the program shall not
  9 23 exceed the lesser of 20 percent of the outstanding student loan
  9 24 debt or $15,000.
  9 25    Matching payments from the authority shall be made from
  9 26 a student loan repayment program fund created in the bill
  9 27 and are subject to the availability of moneys in the fund.
  9 28 Participating individuals are not guaranteed a right to receive
  9 29 repayment assistance under the program.  A county may, but is
  9 30 not required, to provide repayment assistance under its county
  9 31 component even if insufficient funds exist for the authority to
  9 32 provide matching funds.  The student loan repayment program is
  9 33 repealed July 1, 2027.
  9 34    INCOME TAX CREDIT.  The bill provides an individual
  9 35 income tax credit for taxpayers who are domiciled in a rural
 10  1 opportunity zone.  To be eligible for the credit, the taxpayer
 10  2 must meet seven requirements.  First, the taxpayer must be
 10  3 a resident individual.  Second, the taxpayer must have been
 10  4 domiciled in a rural opportunity zone for the entire tax
 10  5 year.  Third, the taxpayer must have established domicile in a
 10  6 rural opportunity zone on or after July 1, 2016, and prior to
 10  7 January 1, 2021.  Fourth, the taxpayer must have been domiciled
 10  8 outside this state for five or more years immediately prior
 10  9 to establishing domicile in a rural opportunity zone.  Fifth,
 10 10 the taxpayer must have had Iowa source net income of less
 10 11 than $10,000 in each of the five years immediately prior to
 10 12 establishing domicile in a rural opportunity zone.  Sixth, the
 10 13 taxpayer's tax return on which the rural opportunity zone tax
 10 14 credit is claimed is timely filed, including any extension of
 10 15 time to file.  Seventh, the taxpayer must not be delinquent in
 10 16 filing any tax return with this state or have any indebtedness
 10 17 owed to the state or a political subdivision of the state.
 10 18    The tax credit is equal to the taxpayer's total individual
 10 19 income tax owed to the state, computed without regard to
 10 20 reductions for the rural opportunity zone credit, withholding
 10 21 on the taxpayer's wages or other income, and any estimated tax
 10 22 payments made by the individual.  The maximum amount that may
 10 23 be refunded to a taxpayer in any year the rural opportunity
 10 24 zone tax credit is allowed shall not exceed the sum of the
 10 25 taxpayer's withholding on wages or other income for that year,
 10 26 plus the estimated tax payments made for that year.
 10 27    The tax credit is allowed for five consecutive years
 10 28 following the year the taxpayer first establishes domicile in a
 10 29 rural opportunity zone.  The rural opportunity zone tax credit
 10 30 applies to tax years beginning on or after January 1, 2017,
 10 31 and ending on or before December 31, 2025.  The tax credit is
 10 32 repealed July 1, 2026.

  7 21                           EXPLANATION

  7 24    This bill relates to economic development by creating rural

  7 28 economic development authority (authority) shall designate
  7 29 counties of this state as rural opportunity zones if they meet
  7 30 certain criteria specified in the bill.  A county may apply to

  9  8 the entirety of a calendar year to receive repayment assistance
  9  9 for that year.  After a county creates and implements its
  9 10 county component, it is required to provide a duly adopted
  9 11 resolution to the authority by January 1, 2017.  The resolution
  9 12 shall be irrevocable and shall obligate the county to
  9 13 participate in the program for a period of five years per
  9 14 individual.
  9 15    Participating individuals who remain domiciled in that
  9 16 county are eligible to receive repayment assistance from
  9 17 the county component.  In addition, the authority, through
  9 18 the matching component, shall match each payment made under
  9 19 the county component up to the lesser of 10 percent of the
  9 20 outstanding student loan debt, or $7,500 of the outstanding
  9 21 student loan debt.  The maximum amount of repayment assistance
  9 22 that an individual may receive under the program shall not
  9 23 exceed the lesser of 20 percent of the outstanding student loan
  9 24 debt or $15,000.
  9 25    Matching payments from the authority shall be made from
  9 26 a student loan repayment program fund created in the bill
  9 27 and are subject to the availability of moneys in the fund.
  9 28 Participating individuals are not guaranteed a right to receive
  9 29 repayment assistance under the program.  A county may, but is
  9 30 not required, to provide repayment assistance under its county
  9 31 component even if insufficient funds exist for the authority to
  9 32 provide matching funds.  The student loan repayment program is
  9 33 repealed July 1, 2027.
  9 34    INCOME TAX CREDIT.  The bill provides an individual
  9 35 income tax credit for taxpayers who are domiciled in a rural
 10  1 opportunity zone.  To be eligible for the credit, the taxpayer
 10  2 must meet seven requirements.  First, the taxpayer must be
 10  3 a resident individual.  Second, the taxpayer must have been
 10  4 domiciled in a rural opportunity zone for the entire tax
 10  5 year.  Third, the taxpayer must have established domicile in a

 10  7 January 1, 2021.  Fourth, the taxpayer must have been domiciled
 10  8 outside this state for five or more years immediately prior
 10  9 to establishing domicile in a rural opportunity zone.  Fifth,
 10 10 the taxpayer must have had Iowa source net income of less
 10 11 than $10,000 in each of the five years immediately prior to
 10 12 establishing domicile in a rural opportunity zone.  Sixth, the
 10 13 taxpayer's tax return on which the rural opportunity zone tax
 10 14 credit is claimed is timely filed, including any extension of
 10 15 time to file.  Seventh, the taxpayer must not be delinquent in
 10 16 filing any tax return with this state or have any indebtedness
 10 17 owed to the state or a political subdivision of the state.
 10 18    The tax credit is equal to the taxpayer's total individual
 10 19 income tax owed to the state, computed without regard to
 10 20 reductions for the rural opportunity zone credit, withholding
 10 21 on the taxpayer's wages or other income, and any estimated tax
 10 22 payments made by the individual.  The maximum amount that may
 10 23 be refunded to a taxpayer in any year the rural opportunity
 10 24 zone tax credit is allowed shall not exceed the sum of the
 10 25 taxpayer's withholding on wages or other income for that year,
 10 26 plus the estimated tax payments made for that year.
 10 27    The tax credit is allowed for five consecutive years
 10 28 following the year the taxpayer first establishes domicile in a
 10 29 rural opportunity zone.  The rural opportunity zone tax credit
 10 30 applies to tax years beginning on or after January 1, 2017,
 10 31 and ending on or before December 31, 2025.  The tax credit is
 10 32 repealed July 1, 2026.

  7 21                           EXPLANATION
  7 22 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  7 23 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  7 24    This bill relates to economic development by creating rural
  7 25 opportunity zones within this state, a student loan repayment
  7 26 program and fund, and an individual income tax credit.
  7 27    RURAL OPPORTUNITY ZONES.  The bill provides that the
  7 28 economic development authority (authority) shall designate
  7 29 counties of this state as rural opportunity zones if they meet
  7 30 certain criteria specified in the bill.  A county may apply to
  7 31 the authority for designation as a rural opportunity zone, but
  7 32 application is not required for designation by the authority.
  7 33 Once designated as a rural opportunity zone, a county may lose
  7 34 its designation if events subsequent to its designation cause
  7 35 it to no longer meet the specified criteria.  However, a county
  8  1 shall not lose its designation as a rural opportunity zone
  8  2 during the county's participation in the student loan repayment
  8  3 program described in the bill.  The authority is required to
  8  4 review the eligibility of each county in this state as a rural
  8  5 opportunity zone at least annually.
  8  6    A county is eligible to be designated as a rural opportunity
  8  7 zone if it meets at least two of nine criteria specified in
  8  8 the bill relating to per capita income, average weekly wages,
  8  9 family poverty rate, population loss, aging population, housing
  8 10 vacancies, property valuations, or recent business closures or
  8 11 permanent layoffs.
  8 12    Rural opportunity zone designations are repealed July 1,
  8 13 2027.
  8 14    STUDENT LOAN REPAYMENT PROGRAM.  The bill creates a student
  8 15 loan repayment program within the authority for the purpose of
  8 16 providing student loan repayment assistance on the outstanding
  8 17 student loan debt of certain individuals.  The program consists
  8 18 of a county component for each participating county and a
  8 19 matching component of the state. Qualifying individuals may
  8 20 enroll in both the county component and the matching component
  8 21 of the student loan repayment program.
  8 22    Each county designated by the authority as a rural
  8 23 opportunity zone is eligible to create and implement a
  8 24 county component within the student loan repayment program.
  8 25 Each county component is required to contain uniform terms
  8 26 and conditions prescribed by the authority and shall have
  8 27 certain minimum qualifications.  First, the county component
  8 28 shall apply only to resident individuals who have earned
  8 29 an associate, bachelor, or postgraduate degree, who have
  8 30 outstanding student loan debt, and who establish domicile in
  8 31 that county on or after the county creates the county component
  8 32 of the program, and prior to July 1, 2021.  Second, the county
  8 33 component shall provide that participating individuals are
  8 34 entitled to full participation in the county component for five
  8 35 years, provided the participating individual remains domiciled
  9  1 within that county for the entire five=year period. Third,
  9  2 the county component shall agree to repay, subject to matching
  9  3 payments by the authority over a five=year period, the lesser
  9  4 of 10 percent of the outstanding student loan debt of the
  9  5 participating individual, or $7,500 of the outstanding student
  9  6 loan debt of the participating individual.  A participating
  9  7 individual must remain domiciled in the applicable county for
  9  8 the entirety of a calendar year to receive repayment assistance
  9  9 for that year.  After a county creates and implements its
  9 10 county component, it is required to provide a duly adopted
  9 11 resolution to the authority by January 1, 2017.  The resolution
  9 12 shall be irrevocable and shall obligate the county to
  9 13 participate in the program for a period of five years per
  9 14 individual.
  9 15    Participating individuals who remain domiciled in that
  9 16 county are eligible to receive repayment assistance from
  9 17 the county component.  In addition, the authority, through
  9 18 the matching component, shall match each payment made under
  9 19 the county component up to the lesser of 10 percent of the
  9 20 outstanding student loan debt, or $7,500 of the outstanding
  9 21 student loan debt.  The maximum amount of repayment assistance
  9 22 that an individual may receive under the program shall not
  9 23 exceed the lesser of 20 percent of the outstanding student loan
  9 24 debt or $15,000.
  9 25    Matching payments from the authority shall be made from
  9 26 a student loan repayment program fund created in the bill
  9 27 and are subject to the availability of moneys in the fund.
  9 28 Participating individuals are not guaranteed a right to receive
  9 29 repayment assistance under the program.  A county may, but is
  9 30 not required, to provide repayment assistance under its county
  9 31 component even if insufficient funds exist for the authority to
  9 32 provide matching funds.  The student loan repayment program is
  9 33 repealed July 1, 2027.
  9 34    INCOME TAX CREDIT.  The bill provides an individual
  9 35 income tax credit for taxpayers who are domiciled in a rural
 10  1 opportunity zone.  To be eligible for the credit, the taxpayer
 10  2 must meet seven requirements.  First, the taxpayer must be
 10  3 a resident individual.  Second, the taxpayer must have been
 10  4 domiciled in a rural opportunity zone for the entire tax
 10  5 year.  Third, the taxpayer must have established domicile in a
 10  6 rural opportunity zone on or after July 1, 2016, and prior to
 10  7 January 1, 2021.  Fourth, the taxpayer must have been domiciled
 10  8 outside this state for five or more years immediately prior
 10  9 to establishing domicile in a rural opportunity zone.  Fifth,
 10 10 the taxpayer must have had Iowa source net income of less
 10 11 than $10,000 in each of the five years immediately prior to
 10 12 establishing domicile in a rural opportunity zone.  Sixth, the
 10 13 taxpayer's tax return on which the rural opportunity zone tax
 10 14 credit is claimed is timely filed, including any extension of
 10 15 time to file.  Seventh, the taxpayer must not be delinquent in
 10 16 filing any tax return with this state or have any indebtedness
 10 17 owed to the state or a political subdivision of the state.
 10 18    The tax credit is equal to the taxpayer's total individual
 10 19 income tax owed to the state, computed without regard to
 10 20 reductions for the rural opportunity zone credit, withholding
 10 21 on the taxpayer's wages or other income, and any estimated tax
 10 22 payments made by the individual.  The maximum amount that may
 10 23 be refunded to a taxpayer in any year the rural opportunity
 10 24 zone tax credit is allowed shall not exceed the sum of the
 10 25 taxpayer's withholding on wages or other income for that year,
 10 26 plus the estimated tax payments made for that year.
 10 27    The tax credit is allowed for five consecutive years
 10 28 following the year the taxpayer first establishes domicile in a
 10 29 rural opportunity zone.  The rural opportunity zone tax credit
 10 30 applies to tax years beginning on or after January 1, 2017,
 10 31 and ending on or before December 31, 2025.  The tax credit is
 10 32 repealed July 1, 2026.

  7 22 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  7 23 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  7 24    This bill relates to economic development by creating rural
  7 25 opportunity zones within this state, a student loan repayment
  7 26 program and fund, and an individual income tax credit.
  7 27    RURAL OPPORTUNITY ZONES.  The bill provides that the
  7 28 economic development authority (authority) shall designate
  7 29 counties of this state as rural opportunity zones if they meet
  7 30 certain criteria specified in the bill.  A county may apply to
  7 31 the authority for designation as a rural opportunity zone, but
  7 32 application is not required for designation by the authority.
  7 33 Once designated as a rural opportunity zone, a county may lose
  7 34 its designation if events subsequent to its designation cause
  7 35 it to no longer meet the specified criteria.  However, a county
  8  1 shall not lose its designation as a rural opportunity zone

  8  3 program described in the bill.  The authority is required to

  8 14    STUDENT LOAN REPAYMENT PROGRAM.  The bill creates a student
  8 15 loan repayment program within the authority for the purpose of
  8 16 providing student loan repayment assistance on the outstanding
  8 17 student loan debt of certain individuals.  The program consists
  8 18 of a county component for each participating county and a
  8 19 matching component of the state. Qualifying individuals may
  8 20 enroll in both the county component and the matching component
  8 21 of the student loan repayment program.
  8 22    Each county designated by the authority as a rural
  8 23 opportunity zone is eligible to create and implement a
  8 24 county component within the student loan repayment program.
  8 25 Each county component is required to contain uniform terms
  8 26 and conditions prescribed by the authority and shall have
  8 27 certain minimum qualifications.  First, the county component
  8 28 shall apply only to resident individuals who have earned

  8 30 outstanding student loan debt, and who establish domicile in
  8 31 that county on or after the county creates the county component

  8 33 component shall provide that participating individuals are
  8 34 entitled to full participation in the county component for five

  9  3 payments by the authority over a five=year period, the lesser
  9  4 of 10 percent of the outstanding student loan debt of the

  9  6 loan debt of the participating individual.  A participating
  9  7 individual must remain domiciled in the applicable county for
  9  8 the entirety of a calendar year to receive repayment assistance
  9  9 for that year.  After a county creates and implements its
  9 10 county component, it is required to provide a duly adopted
  9 11 resolution to the authority by January 1, 2017.  The resolution
  9 12 shall be irrevocable and shall obligate the county to
  9 13 participate in the program for a period of five years per
  9 14 individual.
  9 15    Participating individuals who remain domiciled in that
  9 16 county are eligible to receive repayment assistance from
  9 17 the county component.  In addition, the authority, through
  9 18 the matching component, shall match each payment made under
  9 19 the county component up to the lesser of 10 percent of the
  9 20 outstanding student loan debt, or $7,500 of the outstanding
  9 21 student loan debt.  The maximum amount of repayment assistance
  9 22 that an individual may receive under the program shall not
  9 23 exceed the lesser of 20 percent of the outstanding student loan
  9 24 debt or $15,000.
  9 25    Matching payments from the authority shall be made from
  9 26 a student loan repayment program fund created in the bill
  9 27 and are subject to the availability of moneys in the fund.
  9 28 Participating individuals are not guaranteed a right to receive
  9 29 repayment assistance under the program.  A county may, but is
  9 30 not required, to provide repayment assistance under its county
  9 31 component even if insufficient funds exist for the authority to
  9 32 provide matching funds.  The student loan repayment program is
  9 33 repealed July 1, 2027.

 10 15 time to file.  Seventh, the taxpayer must not be delinquent in
 10 16 filing any tax return with this state or have any indebtedness
 10 17 owed to the state or a political subdivision of the state.
 10 18    The tax credit is equal to the taxpayer's total individual
 10 19 income tax owed to the state, computed without regard to
 10 20 reductions for the rural opportunity zone credit, withholding
 10 21 on the taxpayer's wages or other income, and any estimated tax
 10 22 payments made by the individual.  The maximum amount that may

 10 24 zone tax credit is allowed shall not exceed the sum of the
 10 25 taxpayer's withholding on wages or other income for that year,

  7 20    1.  The section of this Act enacting section 422.10A.
  7 21                           EXPLANATION
  7 22 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  7 23 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  7 24    This bill relates to economic development by creating rural
  7 25 opportunity zones within this state, a student loan repayment
  7 26 program and fund, and an individual income tax credit.
  7 27    RURAL OPPORTUNITY ZONES.  The bill provides that the
  7 28 economic development authority (authority) shall designate
  7 29 counties of this state as rural opportunity zones if they meet
  7 30 certain criteria specified in the bill.  A county may apply to
  7 31 the authority for designation as a rural opportunity zone, but
  7 32 application is not required for designation by the authority.
  7 33 Once designated as a rural opportunity zone, a county may lose
  7 34 its designation if events subsequent to its designation cause
  7 35 it to no longer meet the specified criteria.  However, a county
  8  1 shall not lose its designation as a rural opportunity zone
  8  2 during the county's participation in the student loan repayment
  8  3 program described in the bill.  The authority is required to
  8  4 review the eligibility of each county in this state as a rural
  8  5 opportunity zone at least annually.
  8  6    A county is eligible to be designated as a rural opportunity
  8  7 zone if it meets at least two of nine criteria specified in
  8  8 the bill relating to per capita income, average weekly wages,
  8  9 family poverty rate, population loss, aging population, housing
  8 10 vacancies, property valuations, or recent business closures or
  8 11 permanent layoffs.
  8 12    Rural opportunity zone designations are repealed July 1,
  8 13 2027.
  8 14    STUDENT LOAN REPAYMENT PROGRAM.  The bill creates a student
  8 15 loan repayment program within the authority for the purpose of
  8 16 providing student loan repayment assistance on the outstanding
  8 17 student loan debt of certain individuals.  The program consists
  8 18 of a county component for each participating county and a
  8 19 matching component of the state. Qualifying individuals may
  8 20 enroll in both the county component and the matching component
  8 21 of the student loan repayment program.
  8 22    Each county designated by the authority as a rural
  8 23 opportunity zone is eligible to create and implement a
  8 24 county component within the student loan repayment program.
  8 25 Each county component is required to contain uniform terms
  8 26 and conditions prescribed by the authority and shall have
  8 27 certain minimum qualifications.  First, the county component
  8 28 shall apply only to resident individuals who have earned
  8 29 an associate, bachelor, or postgraduate degree, who have
  8 30 outstanding student loan debt, and who establish domicile in
  8 31 that county on or after the county creates the county component
  8 32 of the program, and prior to July 1, 2021.  Second, the county
  8 33 component shall provide that participating individuals are
  8 34 entitled to full participation in the county component for five
  8 35 years, provided the participating individual remains domiciled
  9  1 within that county for the entire five=year period. Third,
  9  2 the county component shall agree to repay, subject to matching
  9  3 payments by the authority over a five=year period, the lesser
  9  4 of 10 percent of the outstanding student loan debt of the
  9  5 participating individual, or $7,500 of the outstanding student
  9  6 loan debt of the participating individual.  A participating
  9  7 individual must remain domiciled in the applicable county for
  9  8 the entirety of a calendar year to receive repayment assistance
  9  9 for that year.  After a county creates and implements its
  9 10 county component, it is required to provide a duly adopted
  9 11 resolution to the authority by January 1, 2017.  The resolution
  9 12 shall be irrevocable and shall obligate the county to
  9 13 participate in the program for a period of five years per
  9 14 individual.
  9 15    Participating individuals who remain domiciled in that
  9 16 county are eligible to receive repayment assistance from
  9 17 the county component.  In addition, the authority, through
  9 18 the matching component, shall match each payment made under
  9 19 the county component up to the lesser of 10 percent of the
  9 20 outstanding student loan debt, or $7,500 of the outstanding
  9 21 student loan debt.  The maximum amount of repayment assistance
  9 22 that an individual may receive under the program shall not
  9 23 exceed the lesser of 20 percent of the outstanding student loan
  9 24 debt or $15,000.
  9 25    Matching payments from the authority shall be made from
  9 26 a student loan repayment program fund created in the bill
  9 27 and are subject to the availability of moneys in the fund.
  9 28 Participating individuals are not guaranteed a right to receive
  9 29 repayment assistance under the program.  A county may, but is
  9 30 not required, to provide repayment assistance under its county
  9 31 component even if insufficient funds exist for the authority to
  9 32 provide matching funds.  The student loan repayment program is
  9 33 repealed July 1, 2027.
  9 34    INCOME TAX CREDIT.  The bill provides an individual
  9 35 income tax credit for taxpayers who are domiciled in a rural
 10  1 opportunity zone.  To be eligible for the credit, the taxpayer
 10  2 must meet seven requirements.  First, the taxpayer must be
 10  3 a resident individual.  Second, the taxpayer must have been
 10  4 domiciled in a rural opportunity zone for the entire tax
 10  5 year.  Third, the taxpayer must have established domicile in a
 10  6 rural opportunity zone on or after July 1, 2016, and prior to
 10  7 January 1, 2021.  Fourth, the taxpayer must have been domiciled
 10  8 outside this state for five or more years immediately prior
 10  9 to establishing domicile in a rural opportunity zone.  Fifth,
 10 10 the taxpayer must have had Iowa source net income of less
 10 11 than $10,000 in each of the five years immediately prior to
 10 12 establishing domicile in a rural opportunity zone.  Sixth, the
 10 13 taxpayer's tax return on which the rural opportunity zone tax
 10 14 credit is claimed is timely filed, including any extension of
 10 15 time to file.  Seventh, the taxpayer must not be delinquent in
 10 16 filing any tax return with this state or have any indebtedness
 10 17 owed to the state or a political subdivision of the state.
 10 18    The tax credit is equal to the taxpayer's total individual
 10 19 income tax owed to the state, computed without regard to
 10 20 reductions for the rural opportunity zone credit, withholding
 10 21 on the taxpayer's wages or other income, and any estimated tax
 10 22 payments made by the individual.  The maximum amount that may
 10 23 be refunded to a taxpayer in any year the rural opportunity
 10 24 zone tax credit is allowed shall not exceed the sum of the
 10 25 taxpayer's withholding on wages or other income for that year,
 10 26 plus the estimated tax payments made for that year.
 10 27    The tax credit is allowed for five consecutive years
 10 28 following the year the taxpayer first establishes domicile in a
 10 29 rural opportunity zone.  The rural opportunity zone tax credit
 10 30 applies to tax years beginning on or after January 1, 2017,
 10 31 and ending on or before December 31, 2025.  The tax credit is
 10 32 repealed July 1, 2026.

  8 18 of a county component for each participating county and a
  8 19 matching component of the state. Qualifying individuals may
  8 20 enroll in both the county component and the matching component
  8 21 of the student loan repayment program.
  8 22    Each county designated by the authority as a rural
  8 23 opportunity zone is eligible to create and implement a
  8 24 county component within the student loan repayment program.
  8 25 Each county component is required to contain uniform terms
  8 26 and conditions prescribed by the authority and shall have
  8 27 certain minimum qualifications.  First, the county component
  8 28 shall apply only to resident individuals who have earned
  8 29 an associate, bachelor, or postgraduate degree, who have
  8 30 outstanding student loan debt, and who establish domicile in
  8 31 that county on or after the county creates the county component
  8 32 of the program, and prior to July 1, 2021.  Second, the county
  8 33 component shall provide that participating individuals are
  8 34 entitled to full participation in the county component for five
  8 35 years, provided the participating individual remains domiciled
  9  1 within that county for the entire five=year period. Third,
  9  2 the county component shall agree to repay, subject to matching
  9  3 payments by the authority over a five=year period, the lesser
  9  4 of 10 percent of the outstanding student loan debt of the
  9  5 participating individual, or $7,500 of the outstanding student
  9  6 loan debt of the participating individual.  A participating
  9  7 individual must remain domiciled in the applicable county for
  9  8 the entirety of a calendar year to receive repayment assistance
  9  9 for that year.  After a county creates and implements its
  9 10 county component, it is required to provide a duly adopted
  9 11 resolution to the authority by January 1, 2017.  The resolution
  9 12 shall be irrevocable and shall obligate the county to
  9 13 participate in the program for a period of five years per
  9 14 individual.
  9 15    Participating individuals who remain domiciled in that
  9 16 county are eligible to receive repayment assistance from
  9 17 the county component.  In addition, the authority, through
  9 18 the matching component, shall match each payment made under
  9 19 the county component up to the lesser of 10 percent of the
  9 20 outstanding student loan debt, or $7,500 of the outstanding
  9 21 student loan debt.  The maximum amount of repayment assistance
  9 22 that an individual may receive under the program shall not
  9 23 exceed the lesser of 20 percent of the outstanding student loan
  9 24 debt or $15,000.
  9 25    Matching payments from the authority shall be made from
  9 26 a student loan repayment program fund created in the bill
  9 27 and are subject to the availability of moneys in the fund.
  9 28 Participating individuals are not guaranteed a right to receive
  9 29 repayment assistance under the program.  A county may, but is
  9 30 not required, to provide repayment assistance under its county
  9 31 component even if insufficient funds exist for the authority to
  9 32 provide matching funds.  The student loan repayment program is
  9 33 repealed July 1, 2027.
  9 34    INCOME TAX CREDIT.  The bill provides an individual
  9 35 income tax credit for taxpayers who are domiciled in a rural
 10  1 opportunity zone.  To be eligible for the credit, the taxpayer
 10  2 must meet seven requirements.  First, the taxpayer must be
 10  3 a resident individual.  Second, the taxpayer must have been
 10  4 domiciled in a rural opportunity zone for the entire tax

 10 14 credit is claimed is timely filed, including any extension of
 10 15 time to file.  Seventh, the taxpayer must not be delinquent in
 10 16 filing any tax return with this state or have any indebtedness
 10 17 owed to the state or a political subdivision of the state.
 10 18    The tax credit is equal to the taxpayer's total individual
 10 19 income tax owed to the state, computed without regard to
 10 20 reductions for the rural opportunity zone credit, withholding
 10 21 on the taxpayer's wages or other income, and any estimated tax
 10 22 payments made by the individual.  The maximum amount that may
 10 23 be refunded to a taxpayer in any year the rural opportunity
 10 24 zone tax credit is allowed shall not exceed the sum of the
 10 25 taxpayer's withholding on wages or other income for that year,
 10 26 plus the estimated tax payments made for that year.
 10 27    The tax credit is allowed for five consecutive years
 10 28 following the year the taxpayer first establishes domicile in a
 10 29 rural opportunity zone.  The rural opportunity zone tax credit
 10 30 applies to tax years beginning on or after January 1, 2017,

  7 21                           EXPLANATION
  7 22 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  7 23 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  7 24    This bill relates to economic development by creating rural
  7 25 opportunity zones within this state, a student loan repayment
  7 26 program and fund, and an individual income tax credit.
  7 27    RURAL OPPORTUNITY ZONES.  The bill provides that the
  7 28 economic development authority (authority) shall designate
  7 29 counties of this state as rural opportunity zones if they meet
  7 30 certain criteria specified in the bill.  A county may apply to
  7 31 the authority for designation as a rural opportunity zone, but
  7 32 application is not required for designation by the authority.
  7 33 Once designated as a rural opportunity zone, a county may lose
  7 34 its designation if events subsequent to its designation cause
  7 35 it to no longer meet the specified criteria.  However, a county
  8  1 shall not lose its designation as a rural opportunity zone
  8  2 during the county's participation in the student loan repayment
  8  3 program described in the bill.  The authority is required to
  8  4 review the eligibility of each county in this state as a rural
  8  5 opportunity zone at least annually.
  8  6    A county is eligible to be designated as a rural opportunity
  8  7 zone if it meets at least two of nine criteria specified in
  8  8 the bill relating to per capita income, average weekly wages,
  8  9 family poverty rate, population loss, aging population, housing
  8 10 vacancies, property valuations, or recent business closures or
  8 11 permanent layoffs.
  8 12    Rural opportunity zone designations are repealed July 1,
  8 13 2027.
  8 14    STUDENT LOAN REPAYMENT PROGRAM.  The bill creates a student
  8 15 loan repayment program within the authority for the purpose of
  8 16 providing student loan repayment assistance on the outstanding
  8 17 student loan debt of certain individuals.  The program consists
  8 18 of a county component for each participating county and a
  8 19 matching component of the state. Qualifying individuals may
  8 20 enroll in both the county component and the matching component
  8 21 of the student loan repayment program.
  8 22    Each county designated by the authority as a rural
  8 23 opportunity zone is eligible to create and implement a
  8 24 county component within the student loan repayment program.
  8 25 Each county component is required to contain uniform terms
  8 26 and conditions prescribed by the authority and shall have
  8 27 certain minimum qualifications.  First, the county component
  8 28 shall apply only to resident individuals who have earned
  8 29 an associate, bachelor, or postgraduate degree, who have
  8 30 outstanding student loan debt, and who establish domicile in
  8 31 that county on or after the county creates the county component
  8 32 of the program, and prior to July 1, 2021.  Second, the county
  8 33 component shall provide that participating individuals are
  8 34 entitled to full participation in the county component for five
  8 35 years, provided the participating individual remains domiciled
  9  1 within that county for the entire five=year period. Third,
  9  2 the county component shall agree to repay, subject to matching
  9  3 payments by the authority over a five=year period, the lesser
  9  4 of 10 percent of the outstanding student loan debt of the
  9  5 participating individual, or $7,500 of the outstanding student
  9  6 loan debt of the participating individual.  A participating
  9  7 individual must remain domiciled in the applicable county for
  9  8 the entirety of a calendar year to receive repayment assistance
  9  9 for that year.  After a county creates and implements its
  9 10 county component, it is required to provide a duly adopted
  9 11 resolution to the authority by January 1, 2017.  The resolution
  9 12 shall be irrevocable and shall obligate the county to
  9 13 participate in the program for a period of five years per
  9 14 individual.
  9 15    Participating individuals who remain domiciled in that
  9 16 county are eligible to receive repayment assistance from
  9 17 the county component.  In addition, the authority, through
  9 18 the matching component, shall match each payment made under
  9 19 the county component up to the lesser of 10 percent of the
  9 20 outstanding student loan debt, or $7,500 of the outstanding
  9 21 student loan debt.  The maximum amount of repayment assistance
  9 22 that an individual may receive under the program shall not
  9 23 exceed the lesser of 20 percent of the outstanding student loan
  9 24 debt or $15,000.
  9 25    Matching payments from the authority shall be made from
  9 26 a student loan repayment program fund created in the bill
  9 27 and are subject to the availability of moneys in the fund.
  9 28 Participating individuals are not guaranteed a right to receive
  9 29 repayment assistance under the program.  A county may, but is
  9 30 not required, to provide repayment assistance under its county
  9 31 component even if insufficient funds exist for the authority to
  9 32 provide matching funds.  The student loan repayment program is
  9 33 repealed July 1, 2027.
  9 34    INCOME TAX CREDIT.  The bill provides an individual
  9 35 income tax credit for taxpayers who are domiciled in a rural
 10  1 opportunity zone.  To be eligible for the credit, the taxpayer
 10  2 must meet seven requirements.  First, the taxpayer must be
 10  3 a resident individual.  Second, the taxpayer must have been
 10  4 domiciled in a rural opportunity zone for the entire tax
 10  5 year.  Third, the taxpayer must have established domicile in a

 10  9 to establishing domicile in a rural opportunity zone.  Fifth,
 10 10 the taxpayer must have had Iowa source net income of less

 10 12 establishing domicile in a rural opportunity zone.  Sixth, the
 10 13 taxpayer's tax return on which the rural opportunity zone tax
 10 14 credit is claimed is timely filed, including any extension of
 10 15 time to file.  Seventh, the taxpayer must not be delinquent in
 10 16 filing any tax return with this state or have any indebtedness
 10 17 owed to the state or a political subdivision of the state.
 10 18    The tax credit is equal to the taxpayer's total individual
 10 19 income tax owed to the state, computed without regard to
 10 20 reductions for the rural opportunity zone credit, withholding
 10 21 on the taxpayer's wages or other income, and any estimated tax
 10 22 payments made by the individual.  The maximum amount that may
 10 23 be refunded to a taxpayer in any year the rural opportunity
 10 24 zone tax credit is allowed shall not exceed the sum of the
 10 25 taxpayer's withholding on wages or other income for that year,
 10 26 plus the estimated tax payments made for that year.
 10 27    The tax credit is allowed for five consecutive years
 10 28 following the year the taxpayer first establishes domicile in a
 10 29 rural opportunity zone.  The rural opportunity zone tax credit
 10 30 applies to tax years beginning on or after January 1, 2017,
 10 31 and ending on or before December 31, 2025.  The tax credit is
 10 32 repealed July 1, 2026.

  7 21                           EXPLANATION
  7 22 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  7 23 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  7 24    This bill relates to economic development by creating rural
  7 25 opportunity zones within this state, a student loan repayment

  7 28 economic development authority (authority) shall designate
  7 29 counties of this state as rural opportunity zones if they meet
  7 30 certain criteria specified in the bill.  A county may apply to
  7 31 the authority for designation as a rural opportunity zone, but
  7 32 application is not required for designation by the authority.
  7 33 Once designated as a rural opportunity zone, a county may lose
  7 34 its designation if events subsequent to its designation cause
  7 35 it to no longer meet the specified criteria.  However, a county
  8  1 shall not lose its designation as a rural opportunity zone

  8  3 program described in the bill.  The authority is required to
  8  4 review the eligibility of each county in this state as a rural

  8 17 student loan debt of certain individuals.  The program consists
  8 18 of a county component for each participating county and a
  8 19 matching component of the state. Qualifying individuals may
  8 20 enroll in both the county component and the matching component
  8 21 of the student loan repayment program.
  8 22    Each county designated by the authority as a rural
  8 23 opportunity zone is eligible to create and implement a
  8 24 county component within the student loan repayment program.
  8 25 Each county component is required to contain uniform terms
  8 26 and conditions prescribed by the authority and shall have
  8 27 certain minimum qualifications.  First, the county component
  8 28 shall apply only to resident individuals who have earned

  9  4 of 10 percent of the outstanding student loan debt of the

  9  6 loan debt of the participating individual.  A participating
  9  7 individual must remain domiciled in the applicable county for
  9  8 the entirety of a calendar year to receive repayment assistance
  9  9 for that year.  After a county creates and implements its
  9 10 county component, it is required to provide a duly adopted
  9 11 resolution to the authority by January 1, 2017.  The resolution
  9 12 shall be irrevocable and shall obligate the county to
  9 13 participate in the program for a period of five years per
  9 14 individual.
  9 15    Participating individuals who remain domiciled in that
  9 16 county are eligible to receive repayment assistance from
  9 17 the county component.  In addition, the authority, through

  9 19 the county component up to the lesser of 10 percent of the
  9 20 outstanding student loan debt, or $7,500 of the outstanding

  9 22 that an individual may receive under the program shall not

  9 24 debt or $15,000.
  9 25    Matching payments from the authority shall be made from
  9 26 a student loan repayment program fund created in the bill
  9 27 and are subject to the availability of moneys in the fund.
  9 28 Participating individuals are not guaranteed a right to receive

  9 30 not required, to provide repayment assistance under its county
  9 31 component even if insufficient funds exist for the authority to
  9 32 provide matching funds.  The student loan repayment program is
  9 33 repealed July 1, 2027.
  9 34    INCOME TAX CREDIT.  The bill provides an individual

 10 15 time to file.  Seventh, the taxpayer must not be delinquent in
 10 16 filing any tax return with this state or have any indebtedness
 10 17 owed to the state or a political subdivision of the state.

 10 19 income tax owed to the state, computed without regard to
 10 20 reductions for the rural opportunity zone credit, withholding
 10 21 on the taxpayer's wages or other income, and any estimated tax

  7 21                           EXPLANATION
  7 22 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  7 23 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  7 24    This bill relates to economic development by creating rural
  7 25 opportunity zones within this state, a student loan repayment
  7 26 program and fund, and an individual income tax credit.
  7 27    RURAL OPPORTUNITY ZONES.  The bill provides that the
  7 28 economic development authority (authority) shall designate
  7 29 counties of this state as rural opportunity zones if they meet
  7 30 certain criteria specified in the bill.  A county may apply to
  7 31 the authority for designation as a rural opportunity zone, but
  7 32 application is not required for designation by the authority.
  7 33 Once designated as a rural opportunity zone, a county may lose
  7 34 its designation if events subsequent to its designation cause
  7 35 it to no longer meet the specified criteria.  However, a county
  8  1 shall not lose its designation as a rural opportunity zone
  8  2 during the county's participation in the student loan repayment
  8  3 program described in the bill.  The authority is required to
  8  4 review the eligibility of each county in this state as a rural
  8  5 opportunity zone at least annually.
  8  6    A county is eligible to be designated as a rural opportunity
  8  7 zone if it meets at least two of nine criteria specified in
  8  8 the bill relating to per capita income, average weekly wages,
  8  9 family poverty rate, population loss, aging population, housing
  8 10 vacancies, property valuations, or recent business closures or
  8 11 permanent layoffs.
  8 12    Rural opportunity zone designations are repealed July 1,
  8 13 2027.
  8 14    STUDENT LOAN REPAYMENT PROGRAM.  The bill creates a student
  8 15 loan repayment program within the authority for the purpose of
  8 16 providing student loan repayment assistance on the outstanding
  8 17 student loan debt of certain individuals.  The program consists
  8 18 of a county component for each participating county and a
  8 19 matching component of the state. Qualifying individuals may
  8 20 enroll in both the county component and the matching component
  8 21 of the student loan repayment program.
  8 22    Each county designated by the authority as a rural
  8 23 opportunity zone is eligible to create and implement a
  8 24 county component within the student loan repayment program.
  8 25 Each county component is required to contain uniform terms
  8 26 and conditions prescribed by the authority and shall have
  8 27 certain minimum qualifications.  First, the county component
  8 28 shall apply only to resident individuals who have earned
  8 29 an associate, bachelor, or postgraduate degree, who have
  8 30 outstanding student loan debt, and who establish domicile in
  8 31 that county on or after the county creates the county component
  8 32 of the program, and prior to July 1, 2021.  Second, the county
  8 33 component shall provide that participating individuals are
  8 34 entitled to full participation in the county component for five
  8 35 years, provided the participating individual remains domiciled
  9  1 within that county for the entire five=year period. Third,
  9  2 the county component shall agree to repay, subject to matching
  9  3 payments by the authority over a five=year period, the lesser
  9  4 of 10 percent of the outstanding student loan debt of the
  9  5 participating individual, or $7,500 of the outstanding student
  9  6 loan debt of the participating individual.  A participating
  9  7 individual must remain domiciled in the applicable county for
  9  8 the entirety of a calendar year to receive repayment assistance
  9  9 for that year.  After a county creates and implements its
  9 10 county component, it is required to provide a duly adopted
  9 11 resolution to the authority by January 1, 2017.  The resolution
  9 12 shall be irrevocable and shall obligate the county to
  9 13 participate in the program for a period of five years per
  9 14 individual.
  9 15    Participating individuals who remain domiciled in that
  9 16 county are eligible to receive repayment assistance from
  9 17 the county component.  In addition, the authority, through
  9 18 the matching component, shall match each payment made under
  9 19 the county component up to the lesser of 10 percent of the
  9 20 outstanding student loan debt, or $7,500 of the outstanding
  9 21 student loan debt.  The maximum amount of repayment assistance
  9 22 that an individual may receive under the program shall not
  9 23 exceed the lesser of 20 percent of the outstanding student loan
  9 24 debt or $15,000.
  9 25    Matching payments from the authority shall be made from
  9 26 a student loan repayment program fund created in the bill
  9 27 and are subject to the availability of moneys in the fund.
  9 28 Participating individuals are not guaranteed a right to receive
  9 29 repayment assistance under the program.  A county may, but is
  9 30 not required, to provide repayment assistance under its county
  9 31 component even if insufficient funds exist for the authority to
  9 32 provide matching funds.  The student loan repayment program is
  9 33 repealed July 1, 2027.
  9 34    INCOME TAX CREDIT.  The bill provides an individual
  9 35 income tax credit for taxpayers who are domiciled in a rural
 10  1 opportunity zone.  To be eligible for the credit, the taxpayer
 10  2 must meet seven requirements.  First, the taxpayer must be
 10  3 a resident individual.  Second, the taxpayer must have been
 10  4 domiciled in a rural opportunity zone for the entire tax
 10  5 year.  Third, the taxpayer must have established domicile in a
 10  6 rural opportunity zone on or after July 1, 2016, and prior to
 10  7 January 1, 2021.  Fourth, the taxpayer must have been domiciled
 10  8 outside this state for five or more years immediately prior
 10  9 to establishing domicile in a rural opportunity zone.  Fifth,
 10 10 the taxpayer must have had Iowa source net income of less
 10 11 than $10,000 in each of the five years immediately prior to
 10 12 establishing domicile in a rural opportunity zone.  Sixth, the
 10 13 taxpayer's tax return on which the rural opportunity zone tax
 10 14 credit is claimed is timely filed, including any extension of
 10 15 time to file.  Seventh, the taxpayer must not be delinquent in
 10 16 filing any tax return with this state or have any indebtedness
 10 17 owed to the state or a political subdivision of the state.
 10 18    The tax credit is equal to the taxpayer's total individual
 10 19 income tax owed to the state, computed without regard to
 10 20 reductions for the rural opportunity zone credit, withholding
 10 21 on the taxpayer's wages or other income, and any estimated tax
 10 22 payments made by the individual.  The maximum amount that may
 10 23 be refunded to a taxpayer in any year the rural opportunity
 10 24 zone tax credit is allowed shall not exceed the sum of the
 10 25 taxpayer's withholding on wages or other income for that year,
 10 26 plus the estimated tax payments made for that year.
 10 27    The tax credit is allowed for five consecutive years
 10 28 following the year the taxpayer first establishes domicile in a
 10 29 rural opportunity zone.  The rural opportunity zone tax credit
 10 30 applies to tax years beginning on or after January 1, 2017,
 10 31 and ending on or before December 31, 2025.  The tax credit is
 10 32 repealed July 1, 2026.

  8 23 opportunity zone is eligible to create and implement a
  8 24 county component within the student loan repayment program.
  8 25 Each county component is required to contain uniform terms
  8 26 and conditions prescribed by the authority and shall have
  8 27 certain minimum qualifications.  First, the county component
  8 28 shall apply only to resident individuals who have earned
  8 29 an associate, bachelor, or postgraduate degree, who have
  8 30 outstanding student loan debt, and who establish domicile in
  8 31 that county on or after the county creates the county component
  8 32 of the program, and prior to July 1, 2021.  Second, the county
  8 33 component shall provide that participating individuals are
  8 34 entitled to full participation in the county component for five
  8 35 years, provided the participating individual remains domiciled
  9  1 within that county for the entire five=year period. Third,
  9  2 the county component shall agree to repay, subject to matching
  9  3 payments by the authority over a five=year period, the lesser
  9  4 of 10 percent of the outstanding student loan debt of the
  9  5 participating individual, or $7,500 of the outstanding student
  9  6 loan debt of the participating individual.  A participating
  9  7 individual must remain domiciled in the applicable county for
  9  8 the entirety of a calendar year to receive repayment assistance
  9  9 for that year.  After a county creates and implements its
  9 10 county component, it is required to provide a duly adopted
  9 11 resolution to the authority by January 1, 2017.  The resolution
  9 12 shall be irrevocable and shall obligate the county to
  9 13 participate in the program for a period of five years per
  9 14 individual.
  9 15    Participating individuals who remain domiciled in that
  9 16 county are eligible to receive repayment assistance from
  9 17 the county component.  In addition, the authority, through
  9 18 the matching component, shall match each payment made under
  9 19 the county component up to the lesser of 10 percent of the
  9 20 outstanding student loan debt, or $7,500 of the outstanding
  9 21 student loan debt.  The maximum amount of repayment assistance
  9 22 that an individual may receive under the program shall not
  9 23 exceed the lesser of 20 percent of the outstanding student loan
  9 24 debt or $15,000.
  9 25    Matching payments from the authority shall be made from
  9 26 a student loan repayment program fund created in the bill
  9 27 and are subject to the availability of moneys in the fund.
  9 28 Participating individuals are not guaranteed a right to receive
  9 29 repayment assistance under the program.  A county may, but is
  9 30 not required, to provide repayment assistance under its county
  9 31 component even if insufficient funds exist for the authority to
  9 32 provide matching funds.  The student loan repayment program is
  9 33 repealed July 1, 2027.
  9 34    INCOME TAX CREDIT.  The bill provides an individual
  9 35 income tax credit for taxpayers who are domiciled in a rural
 10  1 opportunity zone.  To be eligible for the credit, the taxpayer
 10  2 must meet seven requirements.  First, the taxpayer must be
 10  3 a resident individual.  Second, the taxpayer must have been
 10  4 domiciled in a rural opportunity zone for the entire tax

 10 14 credit is claimed is timely filed, including any extension of
 10 15 time to file.  Seventh, the taxpayer must not be delinquent in
 10 16 filing any tax return with this state or have any indebtedness
 10 17 owed to the state or a political subdivision of the state.
 10 18    The tax credit is equal to the taxpayer's total individual
 10 19 income tax owed to the state, computed without regard to
 10 20 reductions for the rural opportunity zone credit, withholding
 10 21 on the taxpayer's wages or other income, and any estimated tax
 10 22 payments made by the individual.  The maximum amount that may
 10 23 be refunded to a taxpayer in any year the rural opportunity
 10 24 zone tax credit is allowed shall not exceed the sum of the
 10 25 taxpayer's withholding on wages or other income for that year,
 10 26 plus the estimated tax payments made for that year.
 10 27    The tax credit is allowed for five consecutive years
 10 28 following the year the taxpayer first establishes domicile in a

  7 21                           EXPLANATION
  7 22 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  7 23 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  7 24    This bill relates to economic development by creating rural
  7 25 opportunity zones within this state, a student loan repayment
  7 26 program and fund, and an individual income tax credit.
  7 27    RURAL OPPORTUNITY ZONES.  The bill provides that the
  7 28 economic development authority (authority) shall designate
  7 29 counties of this state as rural opportunity zones if they meet
  7 30 certain criteria specified in the bill.  A county may apply to
  7 31 the authority for designation as a rural opportunity zone, but
  7 32 application is not required for designation by the authority.
  7 33 Once designated as a rural opportunity zone, a county may lose
  7 34 its designation if events subsequent to its designation cause
  7 35 it to no longer meet the specified criteria.  However, a county
  8  1 shall not lose its designation as a rural opportunity zone
  8  2 during the county's participation in the student loan repayment
  8  3 program described in the bill.  The authority is required to
  8  4 review the eligibility of each county in this state as a rural
  8  5 opportunity zone at least annually.
  8  6    A county is eligible to be designated as a rural opportunity
  8  7 zone if it meets at least two of nine criteria specified in
  8  8 the bill relating to per capita income, average weekly wages,
  8  9 family poverty rate, population loss, aging population, housing
  8 10 vacancies, property valuations, or recent business closures or
  8 11 permanent layoffs.
  8 12    Rural opportunity zone designations are repealed July 1,
  8 13 2027.
  8 14    STUDENT LOAN REPAYMENT PROGRAM.  The bill creates a student
  8 15 loan repayment program within the authority for the purpose of
  8 16 providing student loan repayment assistance on the outstanding
  8 17 student loan debt of certain individuals.  The program consists
  8 18 of a county component for each participating county and a
  8 19 matching component of the state. Qualifying individuals may
  8 20 enroll in both the county component and the matching component
  8 21 of the student loan repayment program.
  8 22    Each county designated by the authority as a rural
  8 23 opportunity zone is eligible to create and implement a
  8 24 county component within the student loan repayment program.
  8 25 Each county component is required to contain uniform terms
  8 26 and conditions prescribed by the authority and shall have
  8 27 certain minimum qualifications.  First, the county component
  8 28 shall apply only to resident individuals who have earned
  8 29 an associate, bachelor, or postgraduate degree, who have
  8 30 outstanding student loan debt, and who establish domicile in
  8 31 that county on or after the county creates the county component
  8 32 of the program, and prior to July 1, 2021.  Second, the county
  8 33 component shall provide that participating individuals are
  8 34 entitled to full participation in the county component for five
  8 35 years, provided the participating individual remains domiciled
  9  1 within that county for the entire five=year period. Third,
  9  2 the county component shall agree to repay, subject to matching
  9  3 payments by the authority over a five=year period, the lesser
  9  4 of 10 percent of the outstanding student loan debt of the
  9  5 participating individual, or $7,500 of the outstanding student
  9  6 loan debt of the participating individual.  A participating
  9  7 individual must remain domiciled in the applicable county for
  9  8 the entirety of a calendar year to receive repayment assistance
  9  9 for that year.  After a county creates and implements its
  9 10 county component, it is required to provide a duly adopted
  9 11 resolution to the authority by January 1, 2017.  The resolution
  9 12 shall be irrevocable and shall obligate the county to
  9 13 participate in the program for a period of five years per
  9 14 individual.
  9 15    Participating individuals who remain domiciled in that
  9 16 county are eligible to receive repayment assistance from
  9 17 the county component.  In addition, the authority, through
  9 18 the matching component, shall match each payment made under
  9 19 the county component up to the lesser of 10 percent of the
  9 20 outstanding student loan debt, or $7,500 of the outstanding
  9 21 student loan debt.  The maximum amount of repayment assistance
  9 22 that an individual may receive under the program shall not
  9 23 exceed the lesser of 20 percent of the outstanding student loan
  9 24 debt or $15,000.
  9 25    Matching payments from the authority shall be made from
  9 26 a student loan repayment program fund created in the bill
  9 27 and are subject to the availability of moneys in the fund.
  9 28 Participating individuals are not guaranteed a right to receive
  9 29 repayment assistance under the program.  A county may, but is
  9 30 not required, to provide repayment assistance under its county
  9 31 component even if insufficient funds exist for the authority to
  9 32 provide matching funds.  The student loan repayment program is
  9 33 repealed July 1, 2027.
  9 34    INCOME TAX CREDIT.  The bill provides an individual
  9 35 income tax credit for taxpayers who are domiciled in a rural

 10 14 credit is claimed is timely filed, including any extension of
 10 15 time to file.  Seventh, the taxpayer must not be delinquent in

 10 19 income tax owed to the state, computed without regard to
 10 20 reductions for the rural opportunity zone credit, withholding
 10 21 on the taxpayer's wages or other income, and any estimated tax

 10 24 zone tax credit is allowed shall not exceed the sum of the
 10 25 taxpayer's withholding on wages or other income for that year,
 10 26 plus the estimated tax payments made for that year.

  7 21                           EXPLANATION
  7 22 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  7 23 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  7 24    This bill relates to economic development by creating rural
  7 25 opportunity zones within this state, a student loan repayment
  7 26 program and fund, and an individual income tax credit.
  7 27    RURAL OPPORTUNITY ZONES.  The bill provides that the
  7 28 economic development authority (authority) shall designate
  7 29 counties of this state as rural opportunity zones if they meet
  7 30 certain criteria specified in the bill.  A county may apply to
  7 31 the authority for designation as a rural opportunity zone, but
  7 32 application is not required for designation by the authority.
  7 33 Once designated as a rural opportunity zone, a county may lose
  7 34 its designation if events subsequent to its designation cause
  7 35 it to no longer meet the specified criteria.  However, a county
  8  1 shall not lose its designation as a rural opportunity zone
  8  2 during the county's participation in the student loan repayment
  8  3 program described in the bill.  The authority is required to
  8  4 review the eligibility of each county in this state as a rural
  8  5 opportunity zone at least annually.
  8  6    A county is eligible to be designated as a rural opportunity
  8  7 zone if it meets at least two of nine criteria specified in
  8  8 the bill relating to per capita income, average weekly wages,
  8  9 family poverty rate, population loss, aging population, housing
  8 10 vacancies, property valuations, or recent business closures or
  8 11 permanent layoffs.
  8 12    Rural opportunity zone designations are repealed July 1,
  8 13 2027.
  8 14    STUDENT LOAN REPAYMENT PROGRAM.  The bill creates a student
  8 15 loan repayment program within the authority for the purpose of
  8 16 providing student loan repayment assistance on the outstanding
  8 17 student loan debt of certain individuals.  The program consists
  8 18 of a county component for each participating county and a
  8 19 matching component of the state. Qualifying individuals may
  8 20 enroll in both the county component and the matching component
  8 21 of the student loan repayment program.
  8 22    Each county designated by the authority as a rural
  8 23 opportunity zone is eligible to create and implement a
  8 24 county component within the student loan repayment program.
  8 25 Each county component is required to contain uniform terms
  8 26 and conditions prescribed by the authority and shall have
  8 27 certain minimum qualifications.  First, the county component
  8 28 shall apply only to resident individuals who have earned
  8 29 an associate, bachelor, or postgraduate degree, who have
  8 30 outstanding student loan debt, and who establish domicile in
  8 31 that county on or after the county creates the county component
  8 32 of the program, and prior to July 1, 2021.  Second, the county
  8 33 component shall provide that participating individuals are
  8 34 entitled to full participation in the county component for five
  8 35 years, provided the participating individual remains domiciled
  9  1 within that county for the entire five=year period. Third,
  9  2 the county component shall agree to repay, subject to matching
  9  3 payments by the authority over a five=year period, the lesser
  9  4 of 10 percent of the outstanding student loan debt of the
  9  5 participating individual, or $7,500 of the outstanding student
  9  6 loan debt of the participating individual.  A participating
  9  7 individual must remain domiciled in the applicable county for
  9  8 the entirety of a calendar year to receive repayment assistance
  9  9 for that year.  After a county creates and implements its
  9 10 county component, it is required to provide a duly adopted
  9 11 resolution to the authority by January 1, 2017.  The resolution
  9 12 shall be irrevocable and shall obligate the county to
  9 13 participate in the program for a period of five years per
  9 14 individual.
  9 15    Participating individuals who remain domiciled in that
  9 16 county are eligible to receive repayment assistance from
  9 17 the county component.  In addition, the authority, through
  9 18 the matching component, shall match each payment made under
  9 19 the county component up to the lesser of 10 percent of the
  9 20 outstanding student loan debt, or $7,500 of the outstanding
  9 21 student loan debt.  The maximum amount of repayment assistance
  9 22 that an individual may receive under the program shall not
  9 23 exceed the lesser of 20 percent of the outstanding student loan
  9 24 debt or $15,000.
  9 25    Matching payments from the authority shall be made from
  9 26 a student loan repayment program fund created in the bill
  9 27 and are subject to the availability of moneys in the fund.
  9 28 Participating individuals are not guaranteed a right to receive
  9 29 repayment assistance under the program.  A county may, but is
  9 30 not required, to provide repayment assistance under its county
  9 31 component even if insufficient funds exist for the authority to
  9 32 provide matching funds.  The student loan repayment program is
  9 33 repealed July 1, 2027.
  9 34    INCOME TAX CREDIT.  The bill provides an individual
  9 35 income tax credit for taxpayers who are domiciled in a rural
 10  1 opportunity zone.  To be eligible for the credit, the taxpayer
 10  2 must meet seven requirements.  First, the taxpayer must be
 10  3 a resident individual.  Second, the taxpayer must have been
 10  4 domiciled in a rural opportunity zone for the entire tax
 10  5 year.  Third, the taxpayer must have established domicile in a
 10  6 rural opportunity zone on or after July 1, 2016, and prior to
 10  7 January 1, 2021.  Fourth, the taxpayer must have been domiciled
 10  8 outside this state for five or more years immediately prior
 10  9 to establishing domicile in a rural opportunity zone.  Fifth,
 10 10 the taxpayer must have had Iowa source net income of less
 10 11 than $10,000 in each of the five years immediately prior to
 10 12 establishing domicile in a rural opportunity zone.  Sixth, the
 10 13 taxpayer's tax return on which the rural opportunity zone tax
 10 14 credit is claimed is timely filed, including any extension of
 10 15 time to file.  Seventh, the taxpayer must not be delinquent in
 10 16 filing any tax return with this state or have any indebtedness
 10 17 owed to the state or a political subdivision of the state.
 10 18    The tax credit is equal to the taxpayer's total individual
 10 19 income tax owed to the state, computed without regard to
 10 20 reductions for the rural opportunity zone credit, withholding
 10 21 on the taxpayer's wages or other income, and any estimated tax
 10 22 payments made by the individual.  The maximum amount that may
 10 23 be refunded to a taxpayer in any year the rural opportunity
 10 24 zone tax credit is allowed shall not exceed the sum of the
 10 25 taxpayer's withholding on wages or other income for that year,
 10 26 plus the estimated tax payments made for that year.
 10 27    The tax credit is allowed for five consecutive years
 10 28 following the year the taxpayer first establishes domicile in a
 10 29 rural opportunity zone.  The rural opportunity zone tax credit
 10 30 applies to tax years beginning on or after January 1, 2017,
 10 31 and ending on or before December 31, 2025.  The tax credit is
 10 32 repealed July 1, 2026.

  7 21                           EXPLANATION
  7 22 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  7 23 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  7 24    This bill relates to economic development by creating rural
  7 25 opportunity zones within this state, a student loan repayment
  7 26 program and fund, and an individual income tax credit.
  7 27    RURAL OPPORTUNITY ZONES.  The bill provides that the
  7 28 economic development authority (authority) shall designate
  7 29 counties of this state as rural opportunity zones if they meet
  7 30 certain criteria specified in the bill.  A county may apply to
  7 31 the authority for designation as a rural opportunity zone, but
  7 32 application is not required for designation by the authority.
  7 33 Once designated as a rural opportunity zone, a county may lose
  7 34 its designation if events subsequent to its designation cause
  7 35 it to no longer meet the specified criteria.  However, a county
  8  1 shall not lose its designation as a rural opportunity zone
  8  2 during the county's participation in the student loan repayment
  8  3 program described in the bill.  The authority is required to
  8  4 review the eligibility of each county in this state as a rural
  8  5 opportunity zone at least annually.
  8  6    A county is eligible to be designated as a rural opportunity
  8  7 zone if it meets at least two of nine criteria specified in
  8  8 the bill relating to per capita income, average weekly wages,
  8  9 family poverty rate, population loss, aging population, housing
  8 10 vacancies, property valuations, or recent business closures or
  8 11 permanent layoffs.
  8 12    Rural opportunity zone designations are repealed July 1,
  8 13 2027.
  8 14    STUDENT LOAN REPAYMENT PROGRAM.  The bill creates a student
  8 15 loan repayment program within the authority for the purpose of
  8 16 providing student loan repayment assistance on the outstanding
  8 17 student loan debt of certain individuals.  The program consists
  8 18 of a county component for each participating county and a
  8 19 matching component of the state. Qualifying individuals may
  8 20 enroll in both the county component and the matching component
  8 21 of the student loan repayment program.
  8 22    Each county designated by the authority as a rural
  8 23 opportunity zone is eligible to create and implement a
  8 24 county component within the student loan repayment program.
  8 25 Each county component is required to contain uniform terms
  8 26 and conditions prescribed by the authority and shall have
  8 27 certain minimum qualifications.  First, the county component
  8 28 shall apply only to resident individuals who have earned
  8 29 an associate, bachelor, or postgraduate degree, who have
  8 30 outstanding student loan debt, and who establish domicile in
  8 31 that county on or after the county creates the county component
  8 32 of the program, and prior to July 1, 2021.  Second, the county
  8 33 component shall provide that participating individuals are
  8 34 entitled to full participation in the county component for five
  8 35 years, provided the participating individual remains domiciled
  9  1 within that county for the entire five=year period. Third,
  9  2 the county component shall agree to repay, subject to matching
  9  3 payments by the authority over a five=year period, the lesser
  9  4 of 10 percent of the outstanding student loan debt of the
  9  5 participating individual, or $7,500 of the outstanding student
  9  6 loan debt of the participating individual.  A participating
  9  7 individual must remain domiciled in the applicable county for
  9  8 the entirety of a calendar year to receive repayment assistance
  9  9 for that year.  After a county creates and implements its
  9 10 county component, it is required to provide a duly adopted
  9 11 resolution to the authority by January 1, 2017.  The resolution
  9 12 shall be irrevocable and shall obligate the county to
  9 13 participate in the program for a period of five years per
  9 14 individual.
  9 15    Participating individuals who remain domiciled in that
  9 16 county are eligible to receive repayment assistance from
  9 17 the county component.  In addition, the authority, through
  9 18 the matching component, shall match each payment made under
  9 19 the county component up to the lesser of 10 percent of the
  9 20 outstanding student loan debt, or $7,500 of the outstanding
  9 21 student loan debt.  The maximum amount of repayment assistance
  9 22 that an individual may receive under the program shall not
  9 23 exceed the lesser of 20 percent of the outstanding student loan
  9 24 debt or $15,000.
  9 25    Matching payments from the authority shall be made from
  9 26 a student loan repayment program fund created in the bill
  9 27 and are subject to the availability of moneys in the fund.
  9 28 Participating individuals are not guaranteed a right to receive
  9 29 repayment assistance under the program.  A county may, but is
  9 30 not required, to provide repayment assistance under its county
  9 31 component even if insufficient funds exist for the authority to
  9 32 provide matching funds.  The student loan repayment program is
  9 33 repealed July 1, 2027.

  8  2 during the county's participation in the student loan repayment
  8  3 program described in the bill.  The authority is required to
  8  4 review the eligibility of each county in this state as a rural
  8  5 opportunity zone at least annually.

  8 14    STUDENT LOAN REPAYMENT PROGRAM.  The bill creates a student
  8 15 loan repayment program within the authority for the purpose of
  8 16 providing student loan repayment assistance on the outstanding
  8 17 student loan debt of certain individuals.  The program consists
  8 18 of a county component for each participating county and a
  8 19 matching component of the state. Qualifying individuals may
  8 20 enroll in both the county component and the matching component
  8 21 of the student loan repayment program.
  8 22    Each county designated by the authority as a rural
  8 23 opportunity zone is eligible to create and implement a
  8 24 county component within the student loan repayment program.
  8 25 Each county component is required to contain uniform terms
  8 26 and conditions prescribed by the authority and shall have
  8 27 certain minimum qualifications.  First, the county component
  8 28 shall apply only to resident individuals who have earned
  8 29 an associate, bachelor, or postgraduate degree, who have
  8 30 outstanding student loan debt, and who establish domicile in
  8 31 that county on or after the county creates the county component
  8 32 of the program, and prior to July 1, 2021.  Second, the county
  8 33 component shall provide that participating individuals are
  8 34 entitled to full participation in the county component for five
  8 35 years, provided the participating individual remains domiciled
  9  1 within that county for the entire five=year period. Third,
  9  2 the county component shall agree to repay, subject to matching
  9  3 payments by the authority over a five=year period, the lesser
  9  4 of 10 percent of the outstanding student loan debt of the
  9  5 participating individual, or $7,500 of the outstanding student
  9  6 loan debt of the participating individual.  A participating
  9  7 individual must remain domiciled in the applicable county for
  9  8 the entirety of a calendar year to receive repayment assistance
  9  9 for that year.  After a county creates and implements its
  9 10 county component, it is required to provide a duly adopted
  9 11 resolution to the authority by January 1, 2017.  The resolution
  9 12 shall be irrevocable and shall obligate the county to
  9 13 participate in the program for a period of five years per
  9 14 individual.
  9 15    Participating individuals who remain domiciled in that
  9 16 county are eligible to receive repayment assistance from
  9 17 the county component.  In addition, the authority, through
  9 18 the matching component, shall match each payment made under
  9 19 the county component up to the lesser of 10 percent of the
  9 20 outstanding student loan debt, or $7,500 of the outstanding
  9 21 student loan debt.  The maximum amount of repayment assistance
  9 22 that an individual may receive under the program shall not
  9 23 exceed the lesser of 20 percent of the outstanding student loan
  9 24 debt or $15,000.
  9 25    Matching payments from the authority shall be made from
  9 26 a student loan repayment program fund created in the bill
  9 27 and are subject to the availability of moneys in the fund.
  9 28 Participating individuals are not guaranteed a right to receive
  9 29 repayment assistance under the program.  A county may, but is
  9 30 not required, to provide repayment assistance under its county
  9 31 component even if insufficient funds exist for the authority to
  9 32 provide matching funds.  The student loan repayment program is
  9 33 repealed July 1, 2027.

 10 15 time to file.  Seventh, the taxpayer must not be delinquent in
 10 16 filing any tax return with this state or have any indebtedness
 10 17 owed to the state or a political subdivision of the state.

 10 20 reductions for the rural opportunity zone credit, withholding
 10 21 on the taxpayer's wages or other income, and any estimated tax

 10 24 zone tax credit is allowed shall not exceed the sum of the

  7 21                           EXPLANATION
  7 22 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  7 23 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  7 24    This bill relates to economic development by creating rural
  7 25 opportunity zones within this state, a student loan repayment
  7 26 program and fund, and an individual income tax credit.
  7 27    RURAL OPPORTUNITY ZONES.  The bill provides that the
  7 28 economic development authority (authority) shall designate
  7 29 counties of this state as rural opportunity zones if they meet
  7 30 certain criteria specified in the bill.  A county may apply to
  7 31 the authority for designation as a rural opportunity zone, but
  7 32 application is not required for designation by the authority.
  7 33 Once designated as a rural opportunity zone, a county may lose
  7 34 its designation if events subsequent to its designation cause
  7 35 it to no longer meet the specified criteria.  However, a county
  8  1 shall not lose its designation as a rural opportunity zone
  8  2 during the county's participation in the student loan repayment
  8  3 program described in the bill.  The authority is required to
  8  4 review the eligibility of each county in this state as a rural
  8  5 opportunity zone at least annually.
  8  6    A county is eligible to be designated as a rural opportunity
  8  7 zone if it meets at least two of nine criteria specified in
  8  8 the bill relating to per capita income, average weekly wages,
  8  9 family poverty rate, population loss, aging population, housing
  8 10 vacancies, property valuations, or recent business closures or
  8 11 permanent layoffs.
  8 12    Rural opportunity zone designations are repealed July 1,
  8 13 2027.
  8 14    STUDENT LOAN REPAYMENT PROGRAM.  The bill creates a student
  8 15 loan repayment program within the authority for the purpose of
  8 16 providing student loan repayment assistance on the outstanding
  8 17 student loan debt of certain individuals.  The program consists
  8 18 of a county component for each participating county and a
  8 19 matching component of the state. Qualifying individuals may
  8 20 enroll in both the county component and the matching component
  8 21 of the student loan repayment program.
  8 22    Each county designated by the authority as a rural
  8 23 opportunity zone is eligible to create and implement a
  8 24 county component within the student loan repayment program.
  8 25 Each county component is required to contain uniform terms
  8 26 and conditions prescribed by the authority and shall have
  8 27 certain minimum qualifications.  First, the county component
  8 28 shall apply only to resident individuals who have earned
  8 29 an associate, bachelor, or postgraduate degree, who have
  8 30 outstanding student loan debt, and who establish domicile in
  8 31 that county on or after the county creates the county component
  8 32 of the program, and prior to July 1, 2021.  Second, the county
  8 33 component shall provide that participating individuals are
  8 34 entitled to full participation in the county component for five
  8 35 years, provided the participating individual remains domiciled
  9  1 within that county for the entire five=year period. Third,
  9  2 the county component shall agree to repay, subject to matching
  9  3 payments by the authority over a five=year period, the lesser
  9  4 of 10 percent of the outstanding student loan debt of the
  9  5 participating individual, or $7,500 of the outstanding student
  9  6 loan debt of the participating individual.  A participating
  9  7 individual must remain domiciled in the applicable county for
  9  8 the entirety of a calendar year to receive repayment assistance
  9  9 for that year.  After a county creates and implements its
  9 10 county component, it is required to provide a duly adopted
  9 11 resolution to the authority by January 1, 2017.  The resolution
  9 12 shall be irrevocable and shall obligate the county to
  9 13 participate in the program for a period of five years per
  9 14 individual.
  9 15    Participating individuals who remain domiciled in that
  9 16 county are eligible to receive repayment assistance from
  9 17 the county component.  In addition, the authority, through
  9 18 the matching component, shall match each payment made under
  9 19 the county component up to the lesser of 10 percent of the
  9 20 outstanding student loan debt, or $7,500 of the outstanding
  9 21 student loan debt.  The maximum amount of repayment assistance
  9 22 that an individual may receive under the program shall not
  9 23 exceed the lesser of 20 percent of the outstanding student loan
  9 24 debt or $15,000.
  9 25    Matching payments from the authority shall be made from
  9 26 a student loan repayment program fund created in the bill
  9 27 and are subject to the availability of moneys in the fund.
  9 28 Participating individuals are not guaranteed a right to receive
  9 29 repayment assistance under the program.  A county may, but is
  9 30 not required, to provide repayment assistance under its county
  9 31 component even if insufficient funds exist for the authority to
  9 32 provide matching funds.  The student loan repayment program is
  9 33 repealed July 1, 2027.
  9 34    INCOME TAX CREDIT.  The bill provides an individual
  9 35 income tax credit for taxpayers who are domiciled in a rural
 10  1 opportunity zone.  To be eligible for the credit, the taxpayer
 10  2 must meet seven requirements.  First, the taxpayer must be
 10  3 a resident individual.  Second, the taxpayer must have been
 10  4 domiciled in a rural opportunity zone for the entire tax
 10  5 year.  Third, the taxpayer must have established domicile in a
 10  6 rural opportunity zone on or after July 1, 2016, and prior to
 10  7 January 1, 2021.  Fourth, the taxpayer must have been domiciled
 10  8 outside this state for five or more years immediately prior
 10  9 to establishing domicile in a rural opportunity zone.  Fifth,
 10 10 the taxpayer must have had Iowa source net income of less
 10 11 than $10,000 in each of the five years immediately prior to
 10 12 establishing domicile in a rural opportunity zone.  Sixth, the
 10 13 taxpayer's tax return on which the rural opportunity zone tax
 10 14 credit is claimed is timely filed, including any extension of
 10 15 time to file.  Seventh, the taxpayer must not be delinquent in
 10 16 filing any tax return with this state or have any indebtedness
 10 17 owed to the state or a political subdivision of the state.
 10 18    The tax credit is equal to the taxpayer's total individual
 10 19 income tax owed to the state, computed without regard to
 10 20 reductions for the rural opportunity zone credit, withholding
 10 21 on the taxpayer's wages or other income, and any estimated tax
 10 22 payments made by the individual.  The maximum amount that may
 10 23 be refunded to a taxpayer in any year the rural opportunity
 10 24 zone tax credit is allowed shall not exceed the sum of the
 10 25 taxpayer's withholding on wages or other income for that year,
 10 26 plus the estimated tax payments made for that year.
 10 27    The tax credit is allowed for five consecutive years
 10 28 following the year the taxpayer first establishes domicile in a
 10 29 rural opportunity zone.  The rural opportunity zone tax credit
 10 30 applies to tax years beginning on or after January 1, 2017,
 10 31 and ending on or before December 31, 2025.  The tax credit is
 10 32 repealed July 1, 2026.

  7 21                           EXPLANATION
  7 22 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  7 23 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  7 24    This bill relates to economic development by creating rural
  7 25 opportunity zones within this state, a student loan repayment
  7 26 program and fund, and an individual income tax credit.
  7 27    RURAL OPPORTUNITY ZONES.  The bill provides that the
  7 28 economic development authority (authority) shall designate
  7 29 counties of this state as rural opportunity zones if they meet
  7 30 certain criteria specified in the bill.  A county may apply to
  7 31 the authority for designation as a rural opportunity zone, but
  7 32 application is not required for designation by the authority.
  7 33 Once designated as a rural opportunity zone, a county may lose
  7 34 its designation if events subsequent to its designation cause
  7 35 it to no longer meet the specified criteria.  However, a county
  8  1 shall not lose its designation as a rural opportunity zone
  8  2 during the county's participation in the student loan repayment
  8  3 program described in the bill.  The authority is required to
  8  4 review the eligibility of each county in this state as a rural
  8  5 opportunity zone at least annually.
  8  6    A county is eligible to be designated as a rural opportunity
  8  7 zone if it meets at least two of nine criteria specified in
  8  8 the bill relating to per capita income, average weekly wages,
  8  9 family poverty rate, population loss, aging population, housing
  8 10 vacancies, property valuations, or recent business closures or
  8 11 permanent layoffs.
  8 12    Rural opportunity zone designations are repealed July 1,
  8 13 2027.
  8 14    STUDENT LOAN REPAYMENT PROGRAM.  The bill creates a student
  8 15 loan repayment program within the authority for the purpose of
  8 16 providing student loan repayment assistance on the outstanding
  8 17 student loan debt of certain individuals.  The program consists
  8 18 of a county component for each participating county and a
  8 19 matching component of the state. Qualifying individuals may
  8 20 enroll in both the county component and the matching component
  8 21 of the student loan repayment program.
  8 22    Each county designated by the authority as a rural
  8 23 opportunity zone is eligible to create and implement a
  8 24 county component within the student loan repayment program.
  8 25 Each county component is required to contain uniform terms
  8 26 and conditions prescribed by the authority and shall have
  8 27 certain minimum qualifications.  First, the county component
  8 28 shall apply only to resident individuals who have earned
  8 29 an associate, bachelor, or postgraduate degree, who have
  8 30 outstanding student loan debt, and who establish domicile in
  8 31 that county on or after the county creates the county component
  8 32 of the program, and prior to July 1, 2021.  Second, the county
  8 33 component shall provide that participating individuals are
  8 34 entitled to full participation in the county component for five
  8 35 years, provided the participating individual remains domiciled
  9  1 within that county for the entire five=year period. Third,
  9  2 the county component shall agree to repay, subject to matching
  9  3 payments by the authority over a five=year period, the lesser
  9  4 of 10 percent of the outstanding student loan debt of the
  9  5 participating individual, or $7,500 of the outstanding student
  9  6 loan debt of the participating individual.  A participating
  9  7 individual must remain domiciled in the applicable county for
  9  8 the entirety of a calendar year to receive repayment assistance
  9  9 for that year.  After a county creates and implements its
  9 10 county component, it is required to provide a duly adopted
  9 11 resolution to the authority by January 1, 2017.  The resolution
  9 12 shall be irrevocable and shall obligate the county to
  9 13 participate in the program for a period of five years per
  9 14 individual.
  9 15    Participating individuals who remain domiciled in that
  9 16 county are eligible to receive repayment assistance from
  9 17 the county component.  In addition, the authority, through
  9 18 the matching component, shall match each payment made under
  9 19 the county component up to the lesser of 10 percent of the
  9 20 outstanding student loan debt, or $7,500 of the outstanding
  9 21 student loan debt.  The maximum amount of repayment assistance
  9 22 that an individual may receive under the program shall not
  9 23 exceed the lesser of 20 percent of the outstanding student loan
  9 24 debt or $15,000.
  9 25    Matching payments from the authority shall be made from
  9 26 a student loan repayment program fund created in the bill
  9 27 and are subject to the availability of moneys in the fund.
  9 28 Participating individuals are not guaranteed a right to receive
  9 29 repayment assistance under the program.  A county may, but is
  9 30 not required, to provide repayment assistance under its county
  9 31 component even if insufficient funds exist for the authority to
  9 32 provide matching funds.  The student loan repayment program is
  9 33 repealed July 1, 2027.
  9 34    INCOME TAX CREDIT.  The bill provides an individual
  9 35 income tax credit for taxpayers who are domiciled in a rural

 10  2 must meet seven requirements.  First, the taxpayer must be

 10 14 credit is claimed is timely filed, including any extension of
 10 15 time to file.  Seventh, the taxpayer must not be delinquent in
 10 16 filing any tax return with this state or have any indebtedness
 10 17 owed to the state or a political subdivision of the state.
 10 18    The tax credit is equal to the taxpayer's total individual
 10 19 income tax owed to the state, computed without regard to
 10 20 reductions for the rural opportunity zone credit, withholding
 10 21 on the taxpayer's wages or other income, and any estimated tax
 10 22 payments made by the individual.  The maximum amount that may

 10 24 zone tax credit is allowed shall not exceed the sum of the
 10 25 taxpayer's withholding on wages or other income for that year,

  7 22 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  7 23 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  7 24    This bill relates to economic development by creating rural
  7 25 opportunity zones within this state, a student loan repayment
  7 26 program and fund, and an individual income tax credit.

  7 28 economic development authority (authority) shall designate
  7 29 counties of this state as rural opportunity zones if they meet
  7 30 certain criteria specified in the bill.  A county may apply to
  7 31 the authority for designation as a rural opportunity zone, but
  7 32 application is not required for designation by the authority.
  7 33 Once designated as a rural opportunity zone, a county may lose
  7 34 its designation if events subsequent to its designation cause
  7 35 it to no longer meet the specified criteria.  However, a county
  8  1 shall not lose its designation as a rural opportunity zone
  8  2 during the county's participation in the student loan repayment
  8  3 program described in the bill.  The authority is required to
  8  4 review the eligibility of each county in this state as a rural
  8  5 opportunity zone at least annually.
  8  6    A county is eligible to be designated as a rural opportunity
  8  7 zone if it meets at least two of nine criteria specified in

  8 19 matching component of the state. Qualifying individuals may
  8 20 enroll in both the county component and the matching component
  8 21 of the student loan repayment program.
  8 22    Each county designated by the authority as a rural
  8 23 opportunity zone is eligible to create and implement a
  8 24 county component within the student loan repayment program.
  8 25 Each county component is required to contain uniform terms
  8 26 and conditions prescribed by the authority and shall have
  8 27 certain minimum qualifications.  First, the county component
  8 28 shall apply only to resident individuals who have earned
  8 29 an associate, bachelor, or postgraduate degree, who have
  8 30 outstanding student loan debt, and who establish domicile in
  8 31 that county on or after the county creates the county component

  9  6 loan debt of the participating individual.  A participating
  9  7 individual must remain domiciled in the applicable county for
  9  8 the entirety of a calendar year to receive repayment assistance
  9  9 for that year.  After a county creates and implements its
  9 10 county component, it is required to provide a duly adopted
  9 11 resolution to the authority by January 1, 2017.  The resolution
  9 12 shall be irrevocable and shall obligate the county to
  9 13 participate in the program for a period of five years per
  9 14 individual.
  9 15    Participating individuals who remain domiciled in that
  9 16 county are eligible to receive repayment assistance from

  9  6 loan debt of the participating individual.  A participating
  9  7 individual must remain domiciled in the applicable county for
  9  8 the entirety of a calendar year to receive repayment assistance
  9  9 for that year.  After a county creates and implements its
  9 10 county component, it is required to provide a duly adopted
  9 11 resolution to the authority by January 1, 2017.  The resolution
  9 12 shall be irrevocable and shall obligate the county to
  9 13 participate in the program for a period of five years per
  9 14 individual.
  9 15    Participating individuals who remain domiciled in that
  9 16 county are eligible to receive repayment assistance from
  9 17 the county component.  In addition, the authority, through
  9 18 the matching component, shall match each payment made under

  9 24 debt or $15,000.
  9 25    Matching payments from the authority shall be made from
  9 26 a student loan repayment program fund created in the bill
  9 27 and are subject to the availability of moneys in the fund.
  9 28 Participating individuals are not guaranteed a right to receive
  9 29 repayment assistance under the program.  A county may, but is
  9 30 not required, to provide repayment assistance under its county
  9 31 component even if insufficient funds exist for the authority to

  9 33 repealed July 1, 2027.

 10 14 credit is claimed is timely filed, including any extension of
 10 15 time to file.  Seventh, the taxpayer must not be delinquent in
 10 16 filing any tax return with this state or have any indebtedness
 10 17 owed to the state or a political subdivision of the state.
 10 18    The tax credit is equal to the taxpayer's total individual
 10 19 income tax owed to the state, computed without regard to
 10 20 reductions for the rural opportunity zone credit, withholding
 10 21 on the taxpayer's wages or other income, and any estimated tax

 10 24 zone tax credit is allowed shall not exceed the sum of the
 10 25 taxpayer's withholding on wages or other income for that year,

  8  3 program described in the bill.  The authority is required to

  9 12 shall be irrevocable and shall obligate the county to

  8 24 county component within the student loan repayment program.
  8 25 Each county component is required to contain uniform terms
  8 26 and conditions prescribed by the authority and shall have
  8 27 certain minimum qualifications.  First, the county component
  8 28 shall apply only to resident individuals who have earned
  8 29 an associate, bachelor, or postgraduate degree, who have
  8 30 outstanding student loan debt, and who establish domicile in
  8 31 that county on or after the county creates the county component
  8 32 of the program, and prior to July 1, 2021.  Second, the county
  8 33 component shall provide that participating individuals are
  8 34 entitled to full participation in the county component for five
  8 35 years, provided the participating individual remains domiciled
  9  1 within that county for the entire five=year period. Third,
  9  2 the county component shall agree to repay, subject to matching
  9  3 payments by the authority over a five=year period, the lesser
  9  4 of 10 percent of the outstanding student loan debt of the
  9  5 participating individual, or $7,500 of the outstanding student
  9  6 loan debt of the participating individual.  A participating
  9  7 individual must remain domiciled in the applicable county for
  9  8 the entirety of a calendar year to receive repayment assistance
  9  9 for that year.  After a county creates and implements its
  9 10 county component, it is required to provide a duly adopted
  9 11 resolution to the authority by January 1, 2017.  The resolution
  9 12 shall be irrevocable and shall obligate the county to
  9 13 participate in the program for a period of five years per
  9 14 individual.
  9 15    Participating individuals who remain domiciled in that
  9 16 county are eligible to receive repayment assistance from
  9 17 the county component.  In addition, the authority, through
  9 18 the matching component, shall match each payment made under
  9 19 the county component up to the lesser of 10 percent of the
  9 20 outstanding student loan debt, or $7,500 of the outstanding
  9 21 student loan debt.  The maximum amount of repayment assistance
  9 22 that an individual may receive under the program shall not
  9 23 exceed the lesser of 20 percent of the outstanding student loan
  9 24 debt or $15,000.
  9 25    Matching payments from the authority shall be made from
  9 26 a student loan repayment program fund created in the bill
  9 27 and are subject to the availability of moneys in the fund.
  9 28 Participating individuals are not guaranteed a right to receive
  9 29 repayment assistance under the program.  A county may, but is
  9 30 not required, to provide repayment assistance under its county
  9 31 component even if insufficient funds exist for the authority to
  9 32 provide matching funds.  The student loan repayment program is
  9 33 repealed July 1, 2027.
  9 34    INCOME TAX CREDIT.  The bill provides an individual

 10  2 must meet seven requirements.  First, the taxpayer must be

 10 13 taxpayer's tax return on which the rural opportunity zone tax
 10 14 credit is claimed is timely filed, including any extension of
 10 15 time to file.  Seventh, the taxpayer must not be delinquent in
 10 16 filing any tax return with this state or have any indebtedness
 10 17 owed to the state or a political subdivision of the state.
 10 18    The tax credit is equal to the taxpayer's total individual
 10 19 income tax owed to the state, computed without regard to
 10 20 reductions for the rural opportunity zone credit, withholding
 10 21 on the taxpayer's wages or other income, and any estimated tax

 10 23 be refunded to a taxpayer in any year the rural opportunity
 10 24 zone tax credit is allowed shall not exceed the sum of the
 10 25 taxpayer's withholding on wages or other income for that year,

  7 32 application is not required for designation by the authority.
  7 33 Once designated as a rural opportunity zone, a county may lose
  7 34 its designation if events subsequent to its designation cause
  7 35 it to no longer meet the specified criteria.  However, a county
  8  1 shall not lose its designation as a rural opportunity zone
  8  2 during the county's participation in the student loan repayment
  8  3 program described in the bill.  The authority is required to
  8  4 review the eligibility of each county in this state as a rural
  8  5 opportunity zone at least annually.
  8  6    A county is eligible to be designated as a rural opportunity

  8 19 matching component of the state. Qualifying individuals may
  8 20 enroll in both the county component and the matching component
  8 21 of the student loan repayment program.
  8 22    Each county designated by the authority as a rural
  8 23 opportunity zone is eligible to create and implement a
  8 24 county component within the student loan repayment program.
  8 25 Each county component is required to contain uniform terms
  8 26 and conditions prescribed by the authority and shall have
  8 27 certain minimum qualifications.  First, the county component
  8 28 shall apply only to resident individuals who have earned

  9  6 loan debt of the participating individual.  A participating

  9  8 the entirety of a calendar year to receive repayment assistance
  9  9 for that year.  After a county creates and implements its
  9 10 county component, it is required to provide a duly adopted
  9 11 resolution to the authority by January 1, 2017.  The resolution
  9 12 shall be irrevocable and shall obligate the county to
  9 13 participate in the program for a period of five years per
  9 14 individual.
  9 15    Participating individuals who remain domiciled in that

  9 27 and are subject to the availability of moneys in the fund.

  9 31 component even if insufficient funds exist for the authority to

  8 25 Each county component is required to contain uniform terms
  8 26 and conditions prescribed by the authority and shall have
  8 27 certain minimum qualifications.  First, the county component
  8 28 shall apply only to resident individuals who have earned
  8 29 an associate, bachelor, or postgraduate degree, who have
  8 30 outstanding student loan debt, and who establish domicile in
  8 31 that county on or after the county creates the county component
  8 32 of the program, and prior to July 1, 2021.  Second, the county
  8 33 component shall provide that participating individuals are
  8 34 entitled to full participation in the county component for five
  8 35 years, provided the participating individual remains domiciled
  9  1 within that county for the entire five=year period. Third,
  9  2 the county component shall agree to repay, subject to matching
  9  3 payments by the authority over a five=year period, the lesser
  9  4 of 10 percent of the outstanding student loan debt of the
  9  5 participating individual, or $7,500 of the outstanding student
  9  6 loan debt of the participating individual.  A participating
  9  7 individual must remain domiciled in the applicable county for
  9  8 the entirety of a calendar year to receive repayment assistance
  9  9 for that year.  After a county creates and implements its
  9 10 county component, it is required to provide a duly adopted
  9 11 resolution to the authority by January 1, 2017.  The resolution
  9 12 shall be irrevocable and shall obligate the county to
  9 13 participate in the program for a period of five years per
  9 14 individual.
  9 15    Participating individuals who remain domiciled in that
  9 16 county are eligible to receive repayment assistance from
  9 17 the county component.  In addition, the authority, through
  9 18 the matching component, shall match each payment made under
  9 19 the county component up to the lesser of 10 percent of the
  9 20 outstanding student loan debt, or $7,500 of the outstanding
  9 21 student loan debt.  The maximum amount of repayment assistance
  9 22 that an individual may receive under the program shall not
  9 23 exceed the lesser of 20 percent of the outstanding student loan
  9 24 debt or $15,000.
  9 25    Matching payments from the authority shall be made from
  9 26 a student loan repayment program fund created in the bill
  9 27 and are subject to the availability of moneys in the fund.
  9 28 Participating individuals are not guaranteed a right to receive
  9 29 repayment assistance under the program.  A county may, but is
  9 30 not required, to provide repayment assistance under its county
  9 31 component even if insufficient funds exist for the authority to
  9 32 provide matching funds.  The student loan repayment program is
  9 33 repealed July 1, 2027.

 10 14 credit is claimed is timely filed, including any extension of
 10 15 time to file.  Seventh, the taxpayer must not be delinquent in
 10 16 filing any tax return with this state or have any indebtedness
 10 17 owed to the state or a political subdivision of the state.
 10 18    The tax credit is equal to the taxpayer's total individual
 10 19 income tax owed to the state, computed without regard to
 10 20 reductions for the rural opportunity zone credit, withholding
 10 21 on the taxpayer's wages or other income, and any estimated tax

 10 23 be refunded to a taxpayer in any year the rural opportunity
 10 24 zone tax credit is allowed shall not exceed the sum of the
 10 25 taxpayer's withholding on wages or other income for that year,
 10 26 plus the estimated tax payments made for that year.
 10 27    The tax credit is allowed for five consecutive years
 10 28 following the year the taxpayer first establishes domicile in a

  8  3 program described in the bill.  The authority is required to

  9  1 within that county for the entire five=year period. Third,
  9  2 the county component shall agree to repay, subject to matching
  9  3 payments by the authority over a five=year period, the lesser
  9  4 of 10 percent of the outstanding student loan debt of the
  9  5 participating individual, or $7,500 of the outstanding student
  9  6 loan debt of the participating individual.  A participating
  9  7 individual must remain domiciled in the applicable county for
  9  8 the entirety of a calendar year to receive repayment assistance
  9  9 for that year.  After a county creates and implements its
  9 10 county component, it is required to provide a duly adopted
  9 11 resolution to the authority by January 1, 2017.  The resolution
  9 12 shall be irrevocable and shall obligate the county to
  9 13 participate in the program for a period of five years per
  9 14 individual.
  9 15    Participating individuals who remain domiciled in that
  9 16 county are eligible to receive repayment assistance from
  9 17 the county component.  In addition, the authority, through
  9 18 the matching component, shall match each payment made under

  9 22 that an individual may receive under the program shall not
  9 23 exceed the lesser of 20 percent of the outstanding student loan
  9 24 debt or $15,000.
  9 25    Matching payments from the authority shall be made from
  9 26 a student loan repayment program fund created in the bill
  9 27 and are subject to the availability of moneys in the fund.
  9 28 Participating individuals are not guaranteed a right to receive
  9 29 repayment assistance under the program.  A county may, but is
  9 30 not required, to provide repayment assistance under its county
  9 31 component even if insufficient funds exist for the authority to
  9 32 provide matching funds.  The student loan repayment program is
  9 33 repealed July 1, 2027.
  9 34    INCOME TAX CREDIT.  The bill provides an individual

 10 14 credit is claimed is timely filed, including any extension of
 10 15 time to file.  Seventh, the taxpayer must not be delinquent in
 10 16 filing any tax return with this state or have any indebtedness
 10 17 owed to the state or a political subdivision of the state.
 10 18    The tax credit is equal to the taxpayer's total individual
 10 19 income tax owed to the state, computed without regard to
 10 20 reductions for the rural opportunity zone credit, withholding
 10 21 on the taxpayer's wages or other income, and any estimated tax
 10 22 payments made by the individual.  The maximum amount that may
 10 23 be refunded to a taxpayer in any year the rural opportunity
 10 24 zone tax credit is allowed shall not exceed the sum of the
 10 25 taxpayer's withholding on wages or other income for that year,
 10 26 plus the estimated tax payments made for that year.
 10 27    The tax credit is allowed for five consecutive years

  7 28 economic development authority (authority) shall designate
  7 29 counties of this state as rural opportunity zones if they meet
  7 30 certain criteria specified in the bill.  A county may apply to

  7 32 application is not required for designation by the authority.
  7 33 Once designated as a rural opportunity zone, a county may lose
  7 34 its designation if events subsequent to its designation cause
  7 35 it to no longer meet the specified criteria.  However, a county
  8  1 shall not lose its designation as a rural opportunity zone
  8  2 during the county's participation in the student loan repayment
  8  3 program described in the bill.  The authority is required to
  8  4 review the eligibility of each county in this state as a rural
  8  5 opportunity zone at least annually.
  8  6    A county is eligible to be designated as a rural opportunity

  8 20 enroll in both the county component and the matching component
  8 21 of the student loan repayment program.
  8 22    Each county designated by the authority as a rural
  8 23 opportunity zone is eligible to create and implement a
  8 24 county component within the student loan repayment program.
  8 25 Each county component is required to contain uniform terms
  8 26 and conditions prescribed by the authority and shall have
  8 27 certain minimum qualifications.  First, the county component
  8 28 shall apply only to resident individuals who have earned

  8 30 outstanding student loan debt, and who establish domicile in
  8 31 that county on or after the county creates the county component
  8 32 of the program, and prior to July 1, 2021.  Second, the county

  9  6 loan debt of the participating individual.  A participating

  9  9 for that year.  After a county creates and implements its
  9 10 county component, it is required to provide a duly adopted
  9 11 resolution to the authority by January 1, 2017.  The resolution
  9 12 shall be irrevocable and shall obligate the county to

  9 27 and are subject to the availability of moneys in the fund.
  9 28 Participating individuals are not guaranteed a right to receive

  9 30 not required, to provide repayment assistance under its county
  9 31 component even if insufficient funds exist for the authority to
  9 32 provide matching funds.  The student loan repayment program is
  9 33 repealed July 1, 2027.

 10  3 a resident individual.  Second, the taxpayer must have been
 10  4 domiciled in a rural opportunity zone for the entire tax

 10 12 establishing domicile in a rural opportunity zone.  Sixth, the
 10 13 taxpayer's tax return on which the rural opportunity zone tax
 10 14 credit is claimed is timely filed, including any extension of
 10 15 time to file.  Seventh, the taxpayer must not be delinquent in
 10 16 filing any tax return with this state or have any indebtedness

 10 19 income tax owed to the state, computed without regard to
 10 20 reductions for the rural opportunity zone credit, withholding
 10 21 on the taxpayer's wages or other income, and any estimated tax

  7 21                           EXPLANATION
  7 22 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  7 23 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  7 24    This bill relates to economic development by creating rural
  7 25 opportunity zones within this state, a student loan repayment
  7 26 program and fund, and an individual income tax credit.
  7 27    RURAL OPPORTUNITY ZONES.  The bill provides that the
  7 28 economic development authority (authority) shall designate
  7 29 counties of this state as rural opportunity zones if they meet
  7 30 certain criteria specified in the bill.  A county may apply to
  7 31 the authority for designation as a rural opportunity zone, but
  7 32 application is not required for designation by the authority.
  7 33 Once designated as a rural opportunity zone, a county may lose
  7 34 its designation if events subsequent to its designation cause
  7 35 it to no longer meet the specified criteria.  However, a county
  8  1 shall not lose its designation as a rural opportunity zone
  8  2 during the county's participation in the student loan repayment
  8  3 program described in the bill.  The authority is required to
  8  4 review the eligibility of each county in this state as a rural
  8  5 opportunity zone at least annually.
  8  6    A county is eligible to be designated as a rural opportunity
  8  7 zone if it meets at least two of nine criteria specified in
  8  8 the bill relating to per capita income, average weekly wages,
  8  9 family poverty rate, population loss, aging population, housing
  8 10 vacancies, property valuations, or recent business closures or

  8 12    Rural opportunity zone designations are repealed July 1,

  8 14    STUDENT LOAN REPAYMENT PROGRAM.  The bill creates a student
  8 15 loan repayment program within the authority for the purpose of
  8 16 providing student loan repayment assistance on the outstanding
  8 17 student loan debt of certain individuals.  The program consists
  8 18 of a county component for each participating county and a
  8 19 matching component of the state. Qualifying individuals may
  8 20 enroll in both the county component and the matching component
  8 21 of the student loan repayment program.
  8 22    Each county designated by the authority as a rural
  8 23 opportunity zone is eligible to create and implement a
  8 24 county component within the student loan repayment program.
  8 25 Each county component is required to contain uniform terms
  8 26 and conditions prescribed by the authority and shall have
  8 27 certain minimum qualifications.  First, the county component
  8 28 shall apply only to resident individuals who have earned
  8 29 an associate, bachelor, or postgraduate degree, who have
  8 30 outstanding student loan debt, and who establish domicile in
  8 31 that county on or after the county creates the county component
  8 32 of the program, and prior to July 1, 2021.  Second, the county
  8 33 component shall provide that participating individuals are
  8 34 entitled to full participation in the county component for five
  8 35 years, provided the participating individual remains domiciled
  9  1 within that county for the entire five=year period. Third,
  9  2 the county component shall agree to repay, subject to matching
  9  3 payments by the authority over a five=year period, the lesser
  9  4 of 10 percent of the outstanding student loan debt of the
  9  5 participating individual, or $7,500 of the outstanding student
  9  6 loan debt of the participating individual.  A participating
  9  7 individual must remain domiciled in the applicable county for
  9  8 the entirety of a calendar year to receive repayment assistance
  9  9 for that year.  After a county creates and implements its
  9 10 county component, it is required to provide a duly adopted
  9 11 resolution to the authority by January 1, 2017.  The resolution
  9 12 shall be irrevocable and shall obligate the county to
  9 13 participate in the program for a period of five years per
  9 14 individual.
  9 15    Participating individuals who remain domiciled in that
  9 16 county are eligible to receive repayment assistance from
  9 17 the county component.  In addition, the authority, through
  9 18 the matching component, shall match each payment made under
  9 19 the county component up to the lesser of 10 percent of the
  9 20 outstanding student loan debt, or $7,500 of the outstanding
  9 21 student loan debt.  The maximum amount of repayment assistance
  9 22 that an individual may receive under the program shall not
  9 23 exceed the lesser of 20 percent of the outstanding student loan
  9 24 debt or $15,000.
  9 25    Matching payments from the authority shall be made from
  9 26 a student loan repayment program fund created in the bill
  9 27 and are subject to the availability of moneys in the fund.
  9 28 Participating individuals are not guaranteed a right to receive
  9 29 repayment assistance under the program.  A county may, but is
  9 30 not required, to provide repayment assistance under its county
  9 31 component even if insufficient funds exist for the authority to
  9 32 provide matching funds.  The student loan repayment program is
  9 33 repealed July 1, 2027.
  9 34    INCOME TAX CREDIT.  The bill provides an individual
  9 35 income tax credit for taxpayers who are domiciled in a rural

 10 13 taxpayer's tax return on which the rural opportunity zone tax
 10 14 credit is claimed is timely filed, including any extension of
 10 15 time to file.  Seventh, the taxpayer must not be delinquent in
 10 16 filing any tax return with this state or have any indebtedness
 10 17 owed to the state or a political subdivision of the state.
 10 18    The tax credit is equal to the taxpayer's total individual
 10 19 income tax owed to the state, computed without regard to
 10 20 reductions for the rural opportunity zone credit, withholding
 10 21 on the taxpayer's wages or other income, and any estimated tax
 10 22 payments made by the individual.  The maximum amount that may
 10 23 be refunded to a taxpayer in any year the rural opportunity
 10 24 zone tax credit is allowed shall not exceed the sum of the
 10 25 taxpayer's withholding on wages or other income for that year,
 10 26 plus the estimated tax payments made for that year.
 10 27    The tax credit is allowed for five consecutive years
 10 28 following the year the taxpayer first establishes domicile in a

  7 21                           EXPLANATION
  7 22 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  7 23 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  7 24    This bill relates to economic development by creating rural
  7 25 opportunity zones within this state, a student loan repayment
  7 26 program and fund, and an individual income tax credit.
  7 27    RURAL OPPORTUNITY ZONES.  The bill provides that the
  7 28 economic development authority (authority) shall designate
  7 29 counties of this state as rural opportunity zones if they meet
  7 30 certain criteria specified in the bill.  A county may apply to
  7 31 the authority for designation as a rural opportunity zone, but
  7 32 application is not required for designation by the authority.
  7 33 Once designated as a rural opportunity zone, a county may lose
  7 34 its designation if events subsequent to its designation cause
  7 35 it to no longer meet the specified criteria.  However, a county
  8  1 shall not lose its designation as a rural opportunity zone
  8  2 during the county's participation in the student loan repayment
  8  3 program described in the bill.  The authority is required to
  8  4 review the eligibility of each county in this state as a rural
  8  5 opportunity zone at least annually.
  8  6    A county is eligible to be designated as a rural opportunity
  8  7 zone if it meets at least two of nine criteria specified in
  8  8 the bill relating to per capita income, average weekly wages,
  8  9 family poverty rate, population loss, aging population, housing
  8 10 vacancies, property valuations, or recent business closures or
  8 11 permanent layoffs.
  8 12    Rural opportunity zone designations are repealed July 1,
  8 13 2027.
  8 14    STUDENT LOAN REPAYMENT PROGRAM.  The bill creates a student
  8 15 loan repayment program within the authority for the purpose of
  8 16 providing student loan repayment assistance on the outstanding
  8 17 student loan debt of certain individuals.  The program consists
  8 18 of a county component for each participating county and a
  8 19 matching component of the state. Qualifying individuals may
  8 20 enroll in both the county component and the matching component
  8 21 of the student loan repayment program.
  8 22    Each county designated by the authority as a rural
  8 23 opportunity zone is eligible to create and implement a
  8 24 county component within the student loan repayment program.
  8 25 Each county component is required to contain uniform terms
  8 26 and conditions prescribed by the authority and shall have
  8 27 certain minimum qualifications.  First, the county component
  8 28 shall apply only to resident individuals who have earned
  8 29 an associate, bachelor, or postgraduate degree, who have
  8 30 outstanding student loan debt, and who establish domicile in
  8 31 that county on or after the county creates the county component
  8 32 of the program, and prior to July 1, 2021.  Second, the county
  8 33 component shall provide that participating individuals are
  8 34 entitled to full participation in the county component for five
  8 35 years, provided the participating individual remains domiciled
  9  1 within that county for the entire five=year period. Third,
  9  2 the county component shall agree to repay, subject to matching
  9  3 payments by the authority over a five=year period, the lesser
  9  4 of 10 percent of the outstanding student loan debt of the
  9  5 participating individual, or $7,500 of the outstanding student
  9  6 loan debt of the participating individual.  A participating
  9  7 individual must remain domiciled in the applicable county for
  9  8 the entirety of a calendar year to receive repayment assistance
  9  9 for that year.  After a county creates and implements its
  9 10 county component, it is required to provide a duly adopted
  9 11 resolution to the authority by January 1, 2017.  The resolution
  9 12 shall be irrevocable and shall obligate the county to
  9 13 participate in the program for a period of five years per
  9 14 individual.
  9 15    Participating individuals who remain domiciled in that
  9 16 county are eligible to receive repayment assistance from
  9 17 the county component.  In addition, the authority, through
  9 18 the matching component, shall match each payment made under
  9 19 the county component up to the lesser of 10 percent of the
  9 20 outstanding student loan debt, or $7,500 of the outstanding
  9 21 student loan debt.  The maximum amount of repayment assistance
  9 22 that an individual may receive under the program shall not
  9 23 exceed the lesser of 20 percent of the outstanding student loan
  9 24 debt or $15,000.
  9 25    Matching payments from the authority shall be made from
  9 26 a student loan repayment program fund created in the bill
  9 27 and are subject to the availability of moneys in the fund.
  9 28 Participating individuals are not guaranteed a right to receive
  9 29 repayment assistance under the program.  A county may, but is
  9 30 not required, to provide repayment assistance under its county
  9 31 component even if insufficient funds exist for the authority to
  9 32 provide matching funds.  The student loan repayment program is
  9 33 repealed July 1, 2027.
  9 34    INCOME TAX CREDIT.  The bill provides an individual
  9 35 income tax credit for taxpayers who are domiciled in a rural
 10  1 opportunity zone.  To be eligible for the credit, the taxpayer
 10  2 must meet seven requirements.  First, the taxpayer must be
 10  3 a resident individual.  Second, the taxpayer must have been
 10  4 domiciled in a rural opportunity zone for the entire tax
 10  5 year.  Third, the taxpayer must have established domicile in a
 10  6 rural opportunity zone on or after July 1, 2016, and prior to
 10  7 January 1, 2021.  Fourth, the taxpayer must have been domiciled
 10  8 outside this state for five or more years immediately prior
 10  9 to establishing domicile in a rural opportunity zone.  Fifth,
 10 10 the taxpayer must have had Iowa source net income of less
 10 11 than $10,000 in each of the five years immediately prior to
 10 12 establishing domicile in a rural opportunity zone.  Sixth, the
 10 13 taxpayer's tax return on which the rural opportunity zone tax
 10 14 credit is claimed is timely filed, including any extension of
 10 15 time to file.  Seventh, the taxpayer must not be delinquent in
 10 16 filing any tax return with this state or have any indebtedness
 10 17 owed to the state or a political subdivision of the state.
 10 18    The tax credit is equal to the taxpayer's total individual
 10 19 income tax owed to the state, computed without regard to
 10 20 reductions for the rural opportunity zone credit, withholding
 10 21 on the taxpayer's wages or other income, and any estimated tax
 10 22 payments made by the individual.  The maximum amount that may
 10 23 be refunded to a taxpayer in any year the rural opportunity
 10 24 zone tax credit is allowed shall not exceed the sum of the
 10 25 taxpayer's withholding on wages or other income for that year,
 10 26 plus the estimated tax payments made for that year.
 10 27    The tax credit is allowed for five consecutive years
 10 28 following the year the taxpayer first establishes domicile in a
 10 29 rural opportunity zone.  The rural opportunity zone tax credit
 10 30 applies to tax years beginning on or after January 1, 2017,
 10 31 and ending on or before December 31, 2025.  The tax credit is
 10 32 repealed July 1, 2026.

  8  1 shall not lose its designation as a rural opportunity zone
  8  2 during the county's participation in the student loan repayment
  8  3 program described in the bill.  The authority is required to
  8  4 review the eligibility of each county in this state as a rural
  8  5 opportunity zone at least annually.
  8  6    A county is eligible to be designated as a rural opportunity
  8  7 zone if it meets at least two of nine criteria specified in
  8  8 the bill relating to per capita income, average weekly wages,
  8  9 family poverty rate, population loss, aging population, housing
  8 10 vacancies, property valuations, or recent business closures or
  8 11 permanent layoffs.
  8 12    Rural opportunity zone designations are repealed July 1,
  8 13 2027.
  8 14    STUDENT LOAN REPAYMENT PROGRAM.  The bill creates a student
  8 15 loan repayment program within the authority for the purpose of
  8 16 providing student loan repayment assistance on the outstanding
  8 17 student loan debt of certain individuals.  The program consists
  8 18 of a county component for each participating county and a
  8 19 matching component of the state. Qualifying individuals may
  8 20 enroll in both the county component and the matching component
  8 21 of the student loan repayment program.
  8 22    Each county designated by the authority as a rural
  8 23 opportunity zone is eligible to create and implement a
  8 24 county component within the student loan repayment program.
  8 25 Each county component is required to contain uniform terms
  8 26 and conditions prescribed by the authority and shall have
  8 27 certain minimum qualifications.  First, the county component
  8 28 shall apply only to resident individuals who have earned
  8 29 an associate, bachelor, or postgraduate degree, who have
  8 30 outstanding student loan debt, and who establish domicile in
  8 31 that county on or after the county creates the county component
  8 32 of the program, and prior to July 1, 2021.  Second, the county
  8 33 component shall provide that participating individuals are
  8 34 entitled to full participation in the county component for five
  8 35 years, provided the participating individual remains domiciled
  9  1 within that county for the entire five=year period. Third,
  9  2 the county component shall agree to repay, subject to matching
  9  3 payments by the authority over a five=year period, the lesser
  9  4 of 10 percent of the outstanding student loan debt of the
  9  5 participating individual, or $7,500 of the outstanding student
  9  6 loan debt of the participating individual.  A participating
  9  7 individual must remain domiciled in the applicable county for
  9  8 the entirety of a calendar year to receive repayment assistance
  9  9 for that year.  After a county creates and implements its
  9 10 county component, it is required to provide a duly adopted
  9 11 resolution to the authority by January 1, 2017.  The resolution
  9 12 shall be irrevocable and shall obligate the county to
  9 13 participate in the program for a period of five years per
  9 14 individual.
  9 15    Participating individuals who remain domiciled in that
  9 16 county are eligible to receive repayment assistance from
  9 17 the county component.  In addition, the authority, through
  9 18 the matching component, shall match each payment made under
  9 19 the county component up to the lesser of 10 percent of the
  9 20 outstanding student loan debt, or $7,500 of the outstanding
  9 21 student loan debt.  The maximum amount of repayment assistance
  9 22 that an individual may receive under the program shall not
  9 23 exceed the lesser of 20 percent of the outstanding student loan
  9 24 debt or $15,000.
  9 25    Matching payments from the authority shall be made from
  9 26 a student loan repayment program fund created in the bill
  9 27 and are subject to the availability of moneys in the fund.
  9 28 Participating individuals are not guaranteed a right to receive
  9 29 repayment assistance under the program.  A county may, but is
  9 30 not required, to provide repayment assistance under its county
  9 31 component even if insufficient funds exist for the authority to
  9 32 provide matching funds.  The student loan repayment program is
  9 33 repealed July 1, 2027.
  9 34    INCOME TAX CREDIT.  The bill provides an individual
  9 35 income tax credit for taxpayers who are domiciled in a rural
 10  1 opportunity zone.  To be eligible for the credit, the taxpayer
 10  2 must meet seven requirements.  First, the taxpayer must be
 10  3 a resident individual.  Second, the taxpayer must have been
 10  4 domiciled in a rural opportunity zone for the entire tax
 10  5 year.  Third, the taxpayer must have established domicile in a
 10  6 rural opportunity zone on or after July 1, 2016, and prior to
 10  7 January 1, 2021.  Fourth, the taxpayer must have been domiciled
 10  8 outside this state for five or more years immediately prior
 10  9 to establishing domicile in a rural opportunity zone.  Fifth,
 10 10 the taxpayer must have had Iowa source net income of less
 10 11 than $10,000 in each of the five years immediately prior to
 10 12 establishing domicile in a rural opportunity zone.  Sixth, the
 10 13 taxpayer's tax return on which the rural opportunity zone tax
 10 14 credit is claimed is timely filed, including any extension of
 10 15 time to file.  Seventh, the taxpayer must not be delinquent in
 10 16 filing any tax return with this state or have any indebtedness
 10 17 owed to the state or a political subdivision of the state.
 10 18    The tax credit is equal to the taxpayer's total individual
 10 19 income tax owed to the state, computed without regard to
 10 20 reductions for the rural opportunity zone credit, withholding
 10 21 on the taxpayer's wages or other income, and any estimated tax
 10 22 payments made by the individual.  The maximum amount that may
 10 23 be refunded to a taxpayer in any year the rural opportunity
 10 24 zone tax credit is allowed shall not exceed the sum of the
 10 25 taxpayer's withholding on wages or other income for that year,
 10 26 plus the estimated tax payments made for that year.
 10 27    The tax credit is allowed for five consecutive years
 10 28 following the year the taxpayer first establishes domicile in a
 10 29 rural opportunity zone.  The rural opportunity zone tax credit
 10 30 applies to tax years beginning on or after January 1, 2017,
 10 31 and ending on or before December 31, 2025.  The tax credit is
 10 32 repealed July 1, 2026.

  7 21                           EXPLANATION
  7 22 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  7 23 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  7 24    This bill relates to economic development by creating rural
  7 25 opportunity zones within this state, a student loan repayment
  7 26 program and fund, and an individual income tax credit.
  7 27    RURAL OPPORTUNITY ZONES.  The bill provides that the
  7 28 economic development authority (authority) shall designate
  7 29 counties of this state as rural opportunity zones if they meet
  7 30 certain criteria specified in the bill.  A county may apply to
  7 31 the authority for designation as a rural opportunity zone, but
  7 32 application is not required for designation by the authority.
  7 33 Once designated as a rural opportunity zone, a county may lose
  7 34 its designation if events subsequent to its designation cause
  7 35 it to no longer meet the specified criteria.  However, a county
  8  1 shall not lose its designation as a rural opportunity zone
  8  2 during the county's participation in the student loan repayment
  8  3 program described in the bill.  The authority is required to
  8  4 review the eligibility of each county in this state as a rural
  8  5 opportunity zone at least annually.
  8  6    A county is eligible to be designated as a rural opportunity
  8  7 zone if it meets at least two of nine criteria specified in
  8  8 the bill relating to per capita income, average weekly wages,
  8  9 family poverty rate, population loss, aging population, housing
  8 10 vacancies, property valuations, or recent business closures or

  8 12    Rural opportunity zone designations are repealed July 1,

  8 14    STUDENT LOAN REPAYMENT PROGRAM.  The bill creates a student
  8 15 loan repayment program within the authority for the purpose of
  8 16 providing student loan repayment assistance on the outstanding
  8 17 student loan debt of certain individuals.  The program consists
  8 18 of a county component for each participating county and a
  8 19 matching component of the state. Qualifying individuals may
  8 20 enroll in both the county component and the matching component
  8 21 of the student loan repayment program.
  8 22    Each county designated by the authority as a rural
  8 23 opportunity zone is eligible to create and implement a
  8 24 county component within the student loan repayment program.
  8 25 Each county component is required to contain uniform terms
  8 26 and conditions prescribed by the authority and shall have
  8 27 certain minimum qualifications.  First, the county component
  8 28 shall apply only to resident individuals who have earned
  8 29 an associate, bachelor, or postgraduate degree, who have
  8 30 outstanding student loan debt, and who establish domicile in
  8 31 that county on or after the county creates the county component
  8 32 of the program, and prior to July 1, 2021.  Second, the county
  8 33 component shall provide that participating individuals are
  8 34 entitled to full participation in the county component for five
  8 35 years, provided the participating individual remains domiciled
  9  1 within that county for the entire five=year period. Third,
  9  2 the county component shall agree to repay, subject to matching
  9  3 payments by the authority over a five=year period, the lesser
  9  4 of 10 percent of the outstanding student loan debt of the
  9  5 participating individual, or $7,500 of the outstanding student
  9  6 loan debt of the participating individual.  A participating
  9  7 individual must remain domiciled in the applicable county for
  9  8 the entirety of a calendar year to receive repayment assistance
  9  9 for that year.  After a county creates and implements its
  9 10 county component, it is required to provide a duly adopted
  9 11 resolution to the authority by January 1, 2017.  The resolution
  9 12 shall be irrevocable and shall obligate the county to
  9 13 participate in the program for a period of five years per
  9 14 individual.
  9 15    Participating individuals who remain domiciled in that
  9 16 county are eligible to receive repayment assistance from
  9 17 the county component.  In addition, the authority, through
  9 18 the matching component, shall match each payment made under
  9 19 the county component up to the lesser of 10 percent of the
  9 20 outstanding student loan debt, or $7,500 of the outstanding
  9 21 student loan debt.  The maximum amount of repayment assistance
  9 22 that an individual may receive under the program shall not
  9 23 exceed the lesser of 20 percent of the outstanding student loan
  9 24 debt or $15,000.
  9 25    Matching payments from the authority shall be made from
  9 26 a student loan repayment program fund created in the bill
  9 27 and are subject to the availability of moneys in the fund.
  9 28 Participating individuals are not guaranteed a right to receive
  9 29 repayment assistance under the program.  A county may, but is
  9 30 not required, to provide repayment assistance under its county
  9 31 component even if insufficient funds exist for the authority to
  9 32 provide matching funds.  The student loan repayment program is
  9 33 repealed July 1, 2027.
  9 34    INCOME TAX CREDIT.  The bill provides an individual

 10 14 credit is claimed is timely filed, including any extension of
 10 15 time to file.  Seventh, the taxpayer must not be delinquent in
 10 16 filing any tax return with this state or have any indebtedness
 10 17 owed to the state or a political subdivision of the state.
 10 18    The tax credit is equal to the taxpayer's total individual
 10 19 income tax owed to the state, computed without regard to
 10 20 reductions for the rural opportunity zone credit, withholding
 10 21 on the taxpayer's wages or other income, and any estimated tax
 10 22 payments made by the individual.  The maximum amount that may
 10 23 be refunded to a taxpayer in any year the rural opportunity
 10 24 zone tax credit is allowed shall not exceed the sum of the
 10 25 taxpayer's withholding on wages or other income for that year,
 10 26 plus the estimated tax payments made for that year.
 10 27    The tax credit is allowed for five consecutive years
 10 28 following the year the taxpayer first establishes domicile in a

  9 14 individual.
  9 15    Participating individuals who remain domiciled in that

  7 22 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  7 23 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  7 24    This bill relates to economic development by creating rural
  7 25 opportunity zones within this state, a student loan repayment
  7 26 program and fund, and an individual income tax credit.
  7 27    RURAL OPPORTUNITY ZONES.  The bill provides that the
  7 28 economic development authority (authority) shall designate
  7 29 counties of this state as rural opportunity zones if they meet
  7 30 certain criteria specified in the bill.  A county may apply to
  7 31 the authority for designation as a rural opportunity zone, but
  7 32 application is not required for designation by the authority.
  7 33 Once designated as a rural opportunity zone, a county may lose
  7 34 its designation if events subsequent to its designation cause
  7 35 it to no longer meet the specified criteria.  However, a county
  8  1 shall not lose its designation as a rural opportunity zone
  8  2 during the county's participation in the student loan repayment
  8  3 program described in the bill.  The authority is required to
  8  4 review the eligibility of each county in this state as a rural
  8  5 opportunity zone at least annually.
  8  6    A county is eligible to be designated as a rural opportunity
  8  7 zone if it meets at least two of nine criteria specified in
  8  8 the bill relating to per capita income, average weekly wages,
  8  9 family poverty rate, population loss, aging population, housing
  8 10 vacancies, property valuations, or recent business closures or

  8 14    STUDENT LOAN REPAYMENT PROGRAM.  The bill creates a student
  8 15 loan repayment program within the authority for the purpose of
  8 16 providing student loan repayment assistance on the outstanding
  8 17 student loan debt of certain individuals.  The program consists
  8 18 of a county component for each participating county and a
  8 19 matching component of the state. Qualifying individuals may
  8 20 enroll in both the county component and the matching component
  8 21 of the student loan repayment program.
  8 22    Each county designated by the authority as a rural
  8 23 opportunity zone is eligible to create and implement a
  8 24 county component within the student loan repayment program.
  8 25 Each county component is required to contain uniform terms
  8 26 and conditions prescribed by the authority and shall have
  8 27 certain minimum qualifications.  First, the county component
  8 28 shall apply only to resident individuals who have earned
  8 29 an associate, bachelor, or postgraduate degree, who have
  8 30 outstanding student loan debt, and who establish domicile in
  8 31 that county on or after the county creates the county component
  8 32 of the program, and prior to July 1, 2021.  Second, the county
  8 33 component shall provide that participating individuals are
  8 34 entitled to full participation in the county component for five
  8 35 years, provided the participating individual remains domiciled
  9  1 within that county for the entire five=year period. Third,
  9  2 the county component shall agree to repay, subject to matching
  9  3 payments by the authority over a five=year period, the lesser
  9  4 of 10 percent of the outstanding student loan debt of the
  9  5 participating individual, or $7,500 of the outstanding student
  9  6 loan debt of the participating individual.  A participating
  9  7 individual must remain domiciled in the applicable county for
  9  8 the entirety of a calendar year to receive repayment assistance
  9  9 for that year.  After a county creates and implements its
  9 10 county component, it is required to provide a duly adopted
  9 11 resolution to the authority by January 1, 2017.  The resolution
  9 12 shall be irrevocable and shall obligate the county to
  9 13 participate in the program for a period of five years per
  9 14 individual.
  9 15    Participating individuals who remain domiciled in that
  9 16 county are eligible to receive repayment assistance from
  9 17 the county component.  In addition, the authority, through
  9 18 the matching component, shall match each payment made under
  9 19 the county component up to the lesser of 10 percent of the
  9 20 outstanding student loan debt, or $7,500 of the outstanding
  9 21 student loan debt.  The maximum amount of repayment assistance
  9 22 that an individual may receive under the program shall not
  9 23 exceed the lesser of 20 percent of the outstanding student loan
  9 24 debt or $15,000.
  9 25    Matching payments from the authority shall be made from
  9 26 a student loan repayment program fund created in the bill
  9 27 and are subject to the availability of moneys in the fund.
  9 28 Participating individuals are not guaranteed a right to receive
  9 29 repayment assistance under the program.  A county may, but is
  9 30 not required, to provide repayment assistance under its county
  9 31 component even if insufficient funds exist for the authority to
  9 32 provide matching funds.  The student loan repayment program is
  9 33 repealed July 1, 2027.

 10 15 time to file.  Seventh, the taxpayer must not be delinquent in
 10 16 filing any tax return with this state or have any indebtedness
 10 17 owed to the state or a political subdivision of the state.
 10 18    The tax credit is equal to the taxpayer's total individual
 10 19 income tax owed to the state, computed without regard to
 10 20 reductions for the rural opportunity zone credit, withholding
 10 21 on the taxpayer's wages or other income, and any estimated tax

 10 24 zone tax credit is allowed shall not exceed the sum of the
 10 25 taxpayer's withholding on wages or other income for that year,
 10 26 plus the estimated tax payments made for that year.

  9  9 for that year.  After a county creates and implements its
  9 10 county component, it is required to provide a duly adopted
  9 11 resolution to the authority by January 1, 2017.  The resolution
  9 12 shall be irrevocable and shall obligate the county to

  9 14 individual.
  9 15    Participating individuals who remain domiciled in that

 10 20 reductions for the rural opportunity zone credit, withholding
 10 21 on the taxpayer's wages or other income, and any estimated tax
