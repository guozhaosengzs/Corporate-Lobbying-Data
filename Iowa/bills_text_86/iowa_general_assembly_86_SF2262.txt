 17 12 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
 17 13 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
 17 14    This bill relates to criminal asset forfeiture.
 17 15    Asset forfeiture is a process by which contraband and
 17 16 proceeds or instrumentalities related to criminal activity
 17 17 may be seized by the state and sold. Under current law,
 17 18 asset forfeiture is governed by Code chapter 809A.  The bill
 17 19 repeals Code chapter 809A and replaces it with new Code chapter
 17 20 809B.   Currently under Code chapter 809A, a conviction for a
 17 21 criminal offense is not required for an asset to be subject to
 17 22 forfeiture, and forfeiture need not be expressly authorized
 17 23 as a penalty in the criminal statute. The bill provides that
 17 24 property is not subject to forfeiture until a person has
 17 25 been convicted of a felony for which forfeiture is expressly
 17 26 authorized as a penalty.
 17 27    The bill exempts homestead real property, motor vehicles of
 17 28 less than $10,000 in market value, and United States currency
 17 29 totaling $200 or less from forfeiture.
 17 30    Current law requires the state to prove that property is
 17 31 subject to forfeiture by a preponderance of the evidence. The
 17 32 bill requires the state to prove, by clear and convincing
 17 33 evidence, that the property is forfeitable.
 17 34    The bill provides that a defendant is not jointly and
 17 35 severally liable for forfeiture awards owed by other
 18  1 defendants.
 18  2    The bill provides for a proportionality hearing, where
 18  3 the defendant may petition the court that the forfeiture is
 18  4 unconstitutionally excessive.
 18  5    The bill requires law enforcement agencies to provide annual
 18  6 reports to the department of revenue regarding forfeitures
 18  7 completed by the law enforcement agencies. The bill requires
 18  8 the department of revenue to prepare an annual report
 18  9 aggregating the results and to post the aggregate report on the
 18 10 department's internet site.
 18 11    The bill provides that new Code chapter 809B preempts laws by
 18 12 county, city, township, and other tribal and local governments
 18 13 in the state which regulate civil and criminal forfeiture.
 18 14    The bill makes conforming changes relating to the repeal of
 18 15 Code chapter 809A and new Code chapter 809B.
