IOWA
ABLE
SAVINGS
PLAN
TRUST.
The
bill
creates
the
Iowa
10


ABLE
savings
plan
trust
(trust)
under
the
treasurer
of
state
11


(state
treasurer)
that
will
meet
the
requirements
of
§529A
of
12


the
Internal
Revenue
Code
(federal
ABLE
program).
The
state
13


treasurer
is
the
trustee
of
the
trust
and
has
numerous
powers,
14


as
specified
in
the
bill,
for
the
purpose
of
carrying
out
the
15


purpose
of
the
trust.
16


The
trust
is
authorized
to
enter
into
participation
17


agreements
with
individuals
for
the
payment
of
future
qualified
18


disability
expenses.
“Qualified
disability
expenses”
means
the
19


same
as
defined
under
the
federal
ABLE
program,
which
generally
20


defines
the
term
to
include
expenses
related
to
a
designated
21


beneficiary’s
education,
housing,
transportation,
employment
22


training
and
support,
assistive
technology
and
personal
support
23


services,
health,
prevention
and
wellness,
financial
management
24


and
administrative
services,
legal
fees,
expenses
for
oversight
25


and
monitoring,
funeral
and
burial
expenses,
and
other
expenses
26


approved
by
the
secretary
of
the
United
States
treasury
27


(secretary).
28


The
person
with
whom
the
state
treasurer
enters
into
a
29


participation
agreement
must
be
both
the
account
owner
and
30


designated
beneficiary.
However,
the
bill
allows
a
trustee
31


or
legal
guardian
to
be
designated
as
custodian
of
an
account
32


for
a
designated
beneficiary
who
is
a
minor
or
who
lacks
33


capacity
to
enter
into
a
participation
agreement,
provided
such
34


designation
would
be
allowed
under
the
federal
ABLE
program.

“Designated
beneficiary”
is
defined
in
the
bill
as
a
person
1


who
is
a
resident
of
Iowa
and
who
qualifies
as
an
eligible
2


individual
under
the
federal
ABLE
program,
which
includes
3


individuals
who
are
entitled
to
benefits
based
on

under
Title
II
(disability
insurance)

9


The
bill
requires
the
state
treasurer
to
maintain
a
separate
10


account
in
the
trust
for
each
designated
beneficiary
of
a
11


participation
agreement.

13


allowed
to
make
contributions
in
the
form
of
cash
to
an

14


on
behalf
of
a
designated
beneficiary.
The
trust
is
required
15


to
maintain
limits
on
the
annual
contributions
to
an
account,
16


and
the
aggregate
balance
in
an
account,
matching
those
set
17


forth
in
the
federal
ABLE
program,
which
prohibits
annual
18


contributions
to
an
account
from
exceeding
the
annual
gift
tax
19


exclusion
amount
($14,000
for
2015),
and
prohibits
an
aggregate
20


account
balance
from
exceeding
the
limit
set
by
a
state
under
21


its
qualified
tuition
program
(currently
$320,000
for
Iowa).
22


The
bill
provides
other
various
terms
and
conditions
for
23


participation
agreements,
use
and
segregation
of
trust
funds,
24


cancellation
of
agreements
and
refund
of
account
balances,
25


and
ownership
rights
in
the
trust.
The
bill
provides
that
an
26


account
may
be
claimed
by
the
Iowa
Medicaid
program
upon
the
27


death
of
the
designated
beneficiary,
in
accordance
with
the
28


federal
ABLE
program.
The
bill
requires
the
state
treasurer
to
29


prepare
and
submit
audited
financial
reports
to
the
governor
30


and
general
assembly,
and
further
requires
the
state
treasurer
31


to
comply
with
any
reporting
requirements
of
the
federal
ABLE
32


program.
The
bill
applies
to
qualified
disability
expenses
33


incurred
on
or
after
July
1,
2015.
