  4 19 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  4 20 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  4 21    Code chapter 386 currently allows a city to create a self=
  4 22 supported municipal improvement district comprised of areas
  4 23 zoned for commercial or industrial use and property within a
  4 24 duly designated historic district.  This bill allows the city
  4 25 to create a district comprised of an area zoned, in whole or at
  4 26 least in part, for residential use, known as a neighborhood.
  4 27 Any combination of residential, commercial, or industrial
  4 28 properties may comprise such a district.
  4 29    Currently, residential properties located within a district
  4 30 comprised of commercial or industrial properties are exempt
  4 31 from taxes levied under this Code chapter.  This exemption will
  4 32 continue for districts created prior to July 1, 2015.  However,
  4 33 the ordinance creating the district may be amended pursuant
  4 34 to Code section 386.4 to specifically identify and add such

  5  6 year in which property taxes are due, has a claim for the
  5  7 low=income elderly and disabled property tax credit.
