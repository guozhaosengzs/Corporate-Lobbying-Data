  2 20 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  2 21 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  2 22    This bill allows taxpayers to deduct from the computation
  2 23 of net income for purposes of the individual income tax
  2 24 the qualified tuition and related expenses of postsecondary
  2 25 education to the extent not otherwise deductible under federal
  2 26 or state law, and without amount or income limitations.
  2 27    Federal law currently provides a deduction for qualified
  2 28 tuition and related expenses in computing adjusted gross
  2 29 income, but the deduction is subject to amount and income
  2 30 limitations.  For tax year 2014, the federal deduction is
  2 31 limited to $4,000 of expenses if income does not exceed $65,000
  2 32 for a single taxpayer or $130,000 for married taxpayers, and
  2 33 $2,000 of expenses if income exceeds $65,000 but does not
  2 34 exceed $80,000 for a single taxpayer, or if income exceeds
  2 35 $130,000 but does not exceed $160,000 for married taxpayers.
  3  1 The federal deduction is set to expire after the 2014 tax year.
  3  2    The bill defines "qualified tuition and related expenses"
  3  3 to mean the same as defined in Internal Revenue Code section
  3  4 25A(f), which includes tuition and fees required for enrollment
  3  5 or attendance at an eligible educational institution for
  3  6 courses of instruction at such institution.  An eligible
  3  7 educational institution generally includes all accredited
  3  8 public, nonprofit, and for=profit postsecondary institutions
  3  9 that are eligible to participate in a federal financial aid
  3 10 program under title IV of the federal Higher Education Act
  3 11 of 1965.  Expenses related to any course or other education
  3 12 involving sports, games, or hobbies are excluded unless
  3 13 it is part of the degree program, as are student activity
  3 14 fees, athletic fees, insurance expenses, or other expenses
  3 15 unrelated to the academic course of instruction.  "Qualified
  3 16 tuition and related expenses" does not include amounts
  3 17 enumerated in Internal Revenue Code section 25A(g)(2), which
  3 18 includes expenses paid from tax=exempt scholarships or other
  3 19 payments, excluding gifts or inheritance, or from certain
  3 20 veterans' and armed forces educational assistance allowances.
  3 21 "Qualified tuition and related expenses" also does not include
  3 22 amounts excluded from the computation of Iowa net income as
  3 23 contributions to or earnings from an Iowa educational savings
  3 24 plan trust under Iowa Code chapter 12D, or from the computation
  3 25 of federal gross income as distributions of certain earnings
  3 26 from any qualified tuition program qualifying under Internal
  3 27 Revenue Code section 529, or as distributions from a Coverdell
  3 28 education savings account qualifying under Internal Revenue
  3 29 Code section 530.
  3 30    Taxpayers may deduct qualified tuition and related expenses
  3 31 of the taxpayer or the taxpayer's spouse or dependent.  A
  3 32 taxpayer who is eligible to be claimed as a dependent by
  3 33 another is ineligible for the deduction, but any expenses paid
  3 34 by the dependent may be claimed as a deduction by a taxpayer
  3 35 who is eligible to claim the dependent for federal income tax
  4  1 purposes.
  4  2    An Iowa tax credit currently does not exist for the qualified
  4  3 tuition and related expenses that are the subject of the bill,
  4  4 but should one be enacted the bill provides that the deduction
  4  5 provided in the bill will be unavailable to those taxpayers who
  4  6 claim a state tax credit for the same qualified tuition and
  4  7 related expenses.
  4  8    Taxpayers who claim a deduction of educational expenses as
  4  9 an itemized deduction under Code section 422.9, subsection 2,
  4 10 are required to reduce that deduction by the amount deducted
  4 11 under the bill.

  2 20 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  2 21 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  2 22    This bill allows taxpayers to deduct from the computation
  2 23 of net income for purposes of the individual income tax
  2 24 the qualified tuition and related expenses of postsecondary
  2 25 education to the extent not otherwise deductible under federal
  2 26 or state law, and without amount or income limitations.
  2 27    Federal law currently provides a deduction for qualified
  2 28 tuition and related expenses in computing adjusted gross
  2 29 income, but the deduction is subject to amount and income
  2 30 limitations.  For tax year 2014, the federal deduction is
  2 31 limited to $4,000 of expenses if income does not exceed $65,000
  2 32 for a single taxpayer or $130,000 for married taxpayers, and
  2 33 $2,000 of expenses if income exceeds $65,000 but does not
  2 34 exceed $80,000 for a single taxpayer, or if income exceeds
  2 35 $130,000 but does not exceed $160,000 for married taxpayers.
  3  1 The federal deduction is set to expire after the 2014 tax year.
  3  2    The bill defines "qualified tuition and related expenses"
  3  3 to mean the same as defined in Internal Revenue Code section
  3  4 25A(f), which includes tuition and fees required for enrollment
  3  5 or attendance at an eligible educational institution for
  3  6 courses of instruction at such institution.  An eligible
  3  7 educational institution generally includes all accredited
  3  8 public, nonprofit, and for=profit postsecondary institutions
  3  9 that are eligible to participate in a federal financial aid
  3 10 program under title IV of the federal Higher Education Act
  3 11 of 1965.  Expenses related to any course or other education
  3 12 involving sports, games, or hobbies are excluded unless
  3 13 it is part of the degree program, as are student activity
  3 14 fees, athletic fees, insurance expenses, or other expenses
  3 15 unrelated to the academic course of instruction.  "Qualified
  3 16 tuition and related expenses" does not include amounts
  3 17 enumerated in Internal Revenue Code section 25A(g)(2), which
  3 18 includes expenses paid from tax=exempt scholarships or other
  3 19 payments, excluding gifts or inheritance, or from certain
  3 20 veterans' and armed forces educational assistance allowances.
  3 21 "Qualified tuition and related expenses" also does not include
  3 22 amounts excluded from the computation of Iowa net income as
  3 23 contributions to or earnings from an Iowa educational savings
  3 24 plan trust under Iowa Code chapter 12D, or from the computation
  3 25 of federal gross income as distributions of certain earnings
  3 26 from any qualified tuition program qualifying under Internal
  3 27 Revenue Code section 529, or as distributions from a Coverdell
  3 28 education savings account qualifying under Internal Revenue
  3 29 Code section 530.
  3 30    Taxpayers may deduct qualified tuition and related expenses
  3 31 of the taxpayer or the taxpayer's spouse or dependent.  A
  3 32 taxpayer who is eligible to be claimed as a dependent by
  3 33 another is ineligible for the deduction, but any expenses paid
  3 34 by the dependent may be claimed as a deduction by a taxpayer
  3 35 who is eligible to claim the dependent for federal income tax
  4  1 purposes.
  4  2    An Iowa tax credit currently does not exist for the qualified
  4  3 tuition and related expenses that are the subject of the bill,
  4  4 but should one be enacted the bill provides that the deduction
  4  5 provided in the bill will be unavailable to those taxpayers who
  4  6 claim a state tax credit for the same qualified tuition and
  4  7 related expenses.
  4  8    Taxpayers who claim a deduction of educational expenses as
  4  9 an itemized deduction under Code section 422.9, subsection 2,

  2 22    This bill allows taxpayers to deduct from the computation
  2 23 of net income for purposes of the individual income tax
  2 24 the qualified tuition and related expenses of postsecondary
  2 25 education to the extent not otherwise deductible under federal
  2 26 or state law, and without amount or income limitations.
  2 27    Federal law currently provides a deduction for qualified
  2 28 tuition and related expenses in computing adjusted gross
  2 29 income, but the deduction is subject to amount and income
  2 30 limitations.  For tax year 2014, the federal deduction is
  2 31 limited to $4,000 of expenses if income does not exceed $65,000
  2 32 for a single taxpayer or $130,000 for married taxpayers, and
  2 33 $2,000 of expenses if income exceeds $65,000 but does not
  2 34 exceed $80,000 for a single taxpayer, or if income exceeds
  2 35 $130,000 but does not exceed $160,000 for married taxpayers.
  3  1 The federal deduction is set to expire after the 2014 tax year.
  3  2    The bill defines "qualified tuition and related expenses"
  3  3 to mean the same as defined in Internal Revenue Code section
  3  4 25A(f), which includes tuition and fees required for enrollment
  3  5 or attendance at an eligible educational institution for
  3  6 courses of instruction at such institution.  An eligible
  3  7 educational institution generally includes all accredited
  3  8 public, nonprofit, and for=profit postsecondary institutions
  3  9 that are eligible to participate in a federal financial aid
  3 10 program under title IV of the federal Higher Education Act
  3 11 of 1965.  Expenses related to any course or other education
  3 12 involving sports, games, or hobbies are excluded unless
  3 13 it is part of the degree program, as are student activity
  3 14 fees, athletic fees, insurance expenses, or other expenses
  3 15 unrelated to the academic course of instruction.  "Qualified
  3 16 tuition and related expenses" does not include amounts
  3 17 enumerated in Internal Revenue Code section 25A(g)(2), which
  3 18 includes expenses paid from tax=exempt scholarships or other
  3 19 payments, excluding gifts or inheritance, or from certain
  3 20 veterans' and armed forces educational assistance allowances.
  3 21 "Qualified tuition and related expenses" also does not include
  3 22 amounts excluded from the computation of Iowa net income as
  3 23 contributions to or earnings from an Iowa educational savings
  3 24 plan trust under Iowa Code chapter 12D, or from the computation
  3 25 of federal gross income as distributions of certain earnings

  3 27 Revenue Code section 529, or as distributions from a Coverdell
  3 28 education savings account qualifying under Internal Revenue
  3 29 Code section 530.
  3 30    Taxpayers may deduct qualified tuition and related expenses
  3 31 of the taxpayer or the taxpayer's spouse or dependent.  A
  3 32 taxpayer who is eligible to be claimed as a dependent by
  3 33 another is ineligible for the deduction, but any expenses paid
  3 34 by the dependent may be claimed as a deduction by a taxpayer
  3 35 who is eligible to claim the dependent for federal income tax
  4  1 purposes.
  4  2    An Iowa tax credit currently does not exist for the qualified
  4  3 tuition and related expenses that are the subject of the bill,
  4  4 but should one be enacted the bill provides that the deduction
  4  5 provided in the bill will be unavailable to those taxpayers who
  4  6 claim a state tax credit for the same qualified tuition and
  4  7 related expenses.
  4  8    Taxpayers who claim a deduction of educational expenses as
  4  9 an itemized deduction under Code section 422.9, subsection 2,
