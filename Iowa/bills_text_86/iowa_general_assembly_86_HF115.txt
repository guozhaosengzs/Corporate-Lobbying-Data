  1 24    (1)  Medical treatment for life=threatening conditions,
  1 25 provided to a person by a physician licensed to practice

  1 28    (2)  Legitimate medical treatment for life=threatening
  1 29 conditions not intended to harm a person but which has the

  1 31 legitimate medical treatment to preserve the life of a pregnant
  1 32 woman even if the foreseeable effect is harm to the fetus, as
  1 33 long as the person providing the medical treatment exercises
  1 34 that degree of professional skill, care, and diligence
  1 35 available to preserve the life and health of the fetus.
  2  1    (3)  The creation of a person through in vitro fertilization.
