  5 22    BILL'S PROVISIONS.  This bill requires that the owner of
  5 23 land seeking to have the area classified as a fruit=tree or
  5 24 forest reservation (reservation) exempt from property taxes
  5 25 participate in erecting and maintaining a partition fence that
  5 26 borders adjacent land, if the owner of the adjacent land keeps
  5 27 livestock there.  The county assessor or county conservation
  5 28 board, as designated by the county board of supervisors, may
  5 29 request an inspection performed by the appropriate township
  5 30 trustees acting as fence viewers.  The fence viewers must
  5 31 determine whether any partition fence is required to be erected
  5 32 to keep livestock from trespassing onto the area, that any
  5 33 erected fence complies with Iowa's fence law (Code chapter
  5 34 359A), and that the livestock are not habitually trespassing
  5 35 onto the area (Code chapter 169C).  After the tax exemption
  6  1 is granted, the fence viewers may be requested to make a new
  6  2 inspection to determine whether the exemption should continue
  6  3 in a subsequent year. The bill takes effect January 1, 2016,
  6  4 and applies to property taxes due and payable for fiscal years
  6  5 beginning on or after July 1, 2016.
  6  6    BACKGROUND == RESERVATIONS.  A fruit=tree or forest
  6  7 reservation is granted a 100 percent exemption from property
  6  8 taxation.  However, it cannot be used to keep livestock and
  6  9 cannot be used for economic gain (Code section 427C.10).  It
  6 10 also must meet the criteria established by the natural resource
  6 11 commission (Code section 427C.12).  A fruit=tree reservation
  6 12 must not be less than one and not more than 10 acres and a
  6 13 forest reservation cannot be less than two acres (Code section
  6 14 427C.2).  A fruit=tree reservation may be exempt from property
  6 15 taxes for eight years (Code section 427C.7). There is not a
  6 16 time limitation for a forest reservation exemption.
  6 17    BACKGROUND == IOWA FENCE LAW AND LIVESTOCK TRESPASS.  An
  6 18 owner of land must participate in erecting and maintaining a
  6 19 partition fence or contribute to its erection or maintenance,
  6 20 upon receiving a written request by the owner of adjacent land
  6 21 (Code section 359A.1A).  There are a number of different types
  6 22 of fences, including a lawful fence (Code section 359A.18) and
  6 23 a tight fence (Code sections 359A.19 and 359A.20) designed to
  6 24 keep livestock from trespassing onto neighboring land.  Fence
  6 25 viewers may intervene by deciding controversies (Code section
  6 26 359A.3) and may issue orders to erect or maintain a partition
  6 27 fence (Code sections 359A.6 and 359A.8).  Special remedies are
  6 28 available to neighbors suffering from the habitual trespass of
  6 29 livestock (Code section 169C.6).  In order for trespass to be
  6 30 considered habitual, livestock must stray onto neighboring land
  6 31 on three or more separate occasions within a 12=month period.

  6 22 of fences, including a lawful fence (Code section 359A.18) and
  6 23 a tight fence (Code sections 359A.19 and 359A.20) designed to
  6 24 keep livestock from trespassing onto neighboring land.  Fence
  6 25 viewers may intervene by deciding controversies (Code section
  6 26 359A.3) and may issue orders to erect or maintain a partition
  6 27 fence (Code sections 359A.6 and 359A.8).  Special remedies are
  6 28 available to neighbors suffering from the habitual trespass of
  6 29 livestock (Code section 169C.6).  In order for trespass to be
  6 30 considered habitual, livestock must stray onto neighboring land

  5 24 forest reservation (reservation) exempt from property taxes
  5 25 participate in erecting and maintaining a partition fence that
