  5  6                           EXPLANATION
  5  7 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  5  8 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  5  9    This bill, titled the "Right to Try Act", permits
  5 10 manufacturers of investigational drugs, biological products, or
  5 11 devices to make available, and eligible patients with terminal
  5 12 illnesses to attempt treatment with, an investigational
  5 13 drug, biological product, or device as long as they provided
  5 14 written informed consent. The bill defines the terms "eligible
  5 15 patient", "terminal illness", "investigational drug, biological
  5 16 product, or device", and "written informed consent".
  5 17    Under the bill, an eligible patient's physician must
  5 18 acknowledge that the patient's illness is terminal and
  5 19 recommend the patient try an investigational drug, biological
  5 20 product, or device. The patient's written informed consent
  5 21 must acknowledge that treatments currently approved by the
  5 22 United Stated food and drug administration are unlikely to
  5 23 prolong the patient's life. It must identify the specific
  5 24 treatment sought and the potential best, worst, and expected
  5 25 results from the treatment. It must acknowledge that the
  5 26 patient's insurance is not required to pay for the treatment
  5 27 and that any hospice service may refuse to accept the patient
  5 28 after receiving the treatment. It must also acknowledge
  5 29 that expenses will be credited to the patient, including the
  5 30 patient's estate, unless an agreement with the manufacturer of
  5 31 an investigational drug, biological product, or device states
  5 32 otherwise. If the patient dies during treatment, the patient's
  5 33 heirs are not liable for any remaining debts unless otherwise
  5 34 required by law.
  5 35    The manufacturer of an investigational drug, biological
  6  1 product, or device may charge an eligible patient or provide
  6  2 the treatment free of charge. Governmental entities are
  6  3 not required to pay costs associated with the use, care, or
  6  4 treatment of a patient with an investigational drug, biological
  6  5 product, or device. The bill does not require hospitals
  6  6 licensed under chapter 135B or other health care facilities to
  6  7 provide new or additional services.
  6  8    The board of medicine shall not take an adverse action
  6  9 against a physician's license solely for recommending an
  6 10 investigational drug, biological product, or device for the
  6 11 physician's eligible patient. The bill does not create a new
  6 12 private cause of action against any person or entity involved
  6 13 in the care of an eligible patient using the investigational
  6 14 drug, biological product, or device for any harm done to the
  6 15 patient resulting from the treatment if the person or entity
  6 16 is complying in good faith with the terms of the bill and has
  6 17 exercised reasonable care.

  5  7 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  5  8 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  5  9    This bill, titled the "Right to Try Act", permits
  5 10 manufacturers of investigational drugs, biological products, or
  5 11 devices to make available, and eligible patients with terminal
  5 12 illnesses to attempt treatment with, an investigational
  5 13 drug, biological product, or device as long as they provided
  5 14 written informed consent. The bill defines the terms "eligible
  5 15 patient", "terminal illness", "investigational drug, biological
  5 16 product, or device", and "written informed consent".
  5 17    Under the bill, an eligible patient's physician must
  5 18 acknowledge that the patient's illness is terminal and
  5 19 recommend the patient try an investigational drug, biological
  5 20 product, or device. The patient's written informed consent
  5 21 must acknowledge that treatments currently approved by the
  5 22 United Stated food and drug administration are unlikely to
  5 23 prolong the patient's life. It must identify the specific
  5 24 treatment sought and the potential best, worst, and expected
  5 25 results from the treatment. It must acknowledge that the
  5 26 patient's insurance is not required to pay for the treatment
  5 27 and that any hospice service may refuse to accept the patient
  5 28 after receiving the treatment. It must also acknowledge
  5 29 that expenses will be credited to the patient, including the
  5 30 patient's estate, unless an agreement with the manufacturer of
  5 31 an investigational drug, biological product, or device states
  5 32 otherwise. If the patient dies during treatment, the patient's
  5 33 heirs are not liable for any remaining debts unless otherwise
  5 34 required by law.
  5 35    The manufacturer of an investigational drug, biological
  6  1 product, or device may charge an eligible patient or provide
  6  2 the treatment free of charge. Governmental entities are
  6  3 not required to pay costs associated with the use, care, or
  6  4 treatment of a patient with an investigational drug, biological
  6  5 product, or device. The bill does not require hospitals
  6  6 licensed under chapter 135B or other health care facilities to
  6  7 provide new or additional services.
  6  8    The board of medicine shall not take an adverse action
  6  9 against a physician's license solely for recommending an
  6 10 investigational drug, biological product, or device for the
  6 11 physician's eligible patient. The bill does not create a new

  6 13 in the care of an eligible patient using the investigational
  6 14 drug, biological product, or device for any harm done to the
  6 15 patient resulting from the treatment if the person or entity
