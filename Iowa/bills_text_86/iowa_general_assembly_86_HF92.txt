  4 11                           EXPLANATION
  4 12 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  4 13 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  4 14    Current law provides that a person may use reasonable  force,
  4 15 including deadly force, even if an alternative course  of action
  4 16 is available if the alternative entails a risk of  life or
  4 17 safety, or the life or safety of a third party, or  requires one
  4 18 to abandon or retreat from one's residence or  place of business
  4 19 or employment.
  4 20    This bill provides that a person may use reasonable force,
  4 21 including deadly force, if it is reasonable to believe such
  4 22 force is necessary to avoid injury or risk to one's life or
  4 23 safety or the life or safety of another, even if an alternative
  4 24 course of action is available if the alternative entails a risk
  4 25 to life or safety, or the life or safety of a third party.
  4 26    The bill provides that a person may be wrong in the
  4 27 estimation of the danger or the force necessary to repel the
  4 28 danger as long as there is a reasonable basis for the belief
  4 29 and the person acts reasonably in the response to that belief.
  4 30    The bill further provides that a person who is not engaged in
  4 31 an illegal activity has no duty to retreat from any place where
  4 32 the person is lawfully present before using force.  The bill
  4 33 prohibits a finder of fact from considering the possibility of
  4 34 retreat as a factor in determining whether or not a person who
  4 35 used force reasonably believed that the force was necessary to
  5  1 prevent injury, loss, or risk to life or safety.
  5  2    The bill provides that a threat to cause serious injury
  5  3 or death by the production, display, or brandishing of a
  5  4 deadly weapon, is not deadly force, as long as the actions of
  5  5 the person are limited to creating an expectation that the
  5  6 person may use deadly force to defend oneself, another, or as
  5  7 otherwise authorized by law.
  5  8    The bill creates presumptions for the justifiable use of
  5  9 deadly force in certain circumstances.
  5 10    Under the bill, a person is presumed to be justified in
  5 11 using deadly force if the person reasonably believes that
  5 12 deadly force is necessary to avoid injury or risk to one's
  5 13 life or safety or the life or safety of another under the
  5 14 following circumstances: the person against whom force is used
  5 15 is unlawfully entering by force or stealth, or has unlawfully
  5 16 entered by force or stealth and remains within a dwelling,
  5 17 place of business or employment, or occupied vehicle of the
  5 18 person using force; or the person against whom force is used
  5 19 is unlawfully removing or attempting to remove another person
  5 20 against the other person's will from a dwelling, place of
  5 21 business or employment, or occupied vehicle of the person using
  5 22 force.  In addition, the person using force must know or have
  5 23 reason to believe that the aforementioned circumstances are
  5 24 occurring or have occurred.
  5 25    The presumption of the use of justifiable deadly force
  5 26 under the bill does not apply at the time force is used in the
  5 27 following circumstances: the person using defensive force is
  5 28 engaged in a criminal offense or activity; the person sought
  5 29 to be removed is a child or grandchild or is otherwise in the
  5 30 lawful custody of the person against whom force is used; the
  5 31 person against whom force is used is a peace officer who has
  5 32 entered or is attempting to enter a dwelling, place of business
  5 33 or employment, or occupied vehicle in the lawful performance
  5 34 of the peace officer's official duties, and the person using
  5 35 force knows or reasonably should know that the person who has
  6  1 entered or is attempting to enter is a peace officer; or the
  6  2 person against whom force is used has the right to be in, or
  6  3 is a lawful resident of, the dwelling, place of business or
  6  4 employment, or occupied vehicle of the person using force, and
  6  5 a protective or no=contact order is not in effect against the
  6  6 person against whom the force is used.
  6  7    The bill provides that a person is justified in the use of
  6  8 reasonable force when the person reasonably believes that such
  6  9 force is necessary to defend oneself or another from any actual
  6 10 as well as imminent use of unlawful force.
  6 11    The bill repeals Code section 707.6 and consolidates
  6 12 criminal and civil immunity provisions in new Code section
  6 13 704.4A.  Under the bill, a person who uses reasonable force
  6 14 shall be immune from any criminal prosecution or civil action
  6 15 for using such force.
  6 16    Under the bill, a law enforcement agency shall not arrest a
  6 17 person for using force unless it determines there is probable
  6 18 cause that the force was unlawful under Code chapter 704.
  6 19    The bill also provides that if a defendant is sued by a
  6 20 plaintiff for using reasonable force, the court shall award the
  6 21 defendant reasonable attorney fees, court costs, compensation
  6 22 for loss of income, and expenses if the court finds the
  6 23 defendant is immune from prosecution.
  6 24    The bill also provides that a person who reasonably
  6 25 believes that a violent felony is being or will imminently be
  6 26 perpetrated is justified in using reasonable force, including
  6 27 deadly force, against a perpetrator to prevent or terminate the
  6 28 perpetration of that felony. The bill defines "violent felony"
  6 29 to mean any felonious assault, murder, violent or forced sexual
  6 30 abuse, kidnapping, robbery, arson, or burglary.

  5  2    The bill provides that a threat to cause serious injury
  5  3 or death by the production, display, or brandishing of a

  5 11 using deadly force if the person reasonably believes that
  5 12 deadly force is necessary to avoid injury or risk to one's
  5 13 life or safety or the life or safety of another under the
  5 14 following circumstances: the person against whom force is used
  5 15 is unlawfully entering by force or stealth, or has unlawfully
  5 16 entered by force or stealth and remains within a dwelling,
  5 17 place of business or employment, or occupied vehicle of the
  5 18 person using force; or the person against whom force is used
  5 19 is unlawfully removing or attempting to remove another person
  5 20 against the other person's will from a dwelling, place of
  5 21 business or employment, or occupied vehicle of the person using
  5 22 force.  In addition, the person using force must know or have
  5 23 reason to believe that the aforementioned circumstances are
  5 24 occurring or have occurred.
  5 25    The presumption of the use of justifiable deadly force
  5 26 under the bill does not apply at the time force is used in the
  5 27 following circumstances: the person using defensive force is
  5 28 engaged in a criminal offense or activity; the person sought
  5 29 to be removed is a child or grandchild or is otherwise in the
  5 30 lawful custody of the person against whom force is used; the

  5 32 entered or is attempting to enter a dwelling, place of business
  5 33 or employment, or occupied vehicle in the lawful performance
  5 34 of the peace officer's official duties, and the person using
  5 35 force knows or reasonably should know that the person who has
  6  1 entered or is attempting to enter is a peace officer; or the
  6  2 person against whom force is used has the right to be in, or
  6  3 is a lawful resident of, the dwelling, place of business or
  6  4 employment, or occupied vehicle of the person using force, and
  6  5 a protective or no=contact order is not in effect against the
  6  6 person against whom the force is used.
  6  7    The bill provides that a person is justified in the use of
  6  8 reasonable force when the person reasonably believes that such
  6  9 force is necessary to defend oneself or another from any actual
  6 10 as well as imminent use of unlawful force.

  6 15 for using such force.

  6 20 plaintiff for using reasonable force, the court shall award the
  6 21 defendant reasonable attorney fees, court costs, compensation
  6 22 for loss of income, and expenses if the court finds the
  6 23 defendant is immune from prosecution.
  6 24    The bill also provides that a person who reasonably
  6 25 believes that a violent felony is being or will imminently be
  6 26 perpetrated is justified in using reasonable force, including
  6 27 deadly force, against a perpetrator to prevent or terminate the
  6 28 perpetration of that felony. The bill defines "violent felony"
  6 29 to mean any felonious assault, murder, violent or forced sexual
