  5  5 restricting the ownership, possession, legal transfer, lawful
  5  6 transportation, registration, or licensing of firearms when the
  5  7 ownership, possession, transfer, or transportation is otherwise
  5  8 lawful under state law.
  5  9    This bill strikes and rewrites this Code section to provide
  5 10 that the regulation of firearms, firearm accessories, and
  5 11 ammunition is declared to be the exclusive domain of the state.
  5 12 The bill provides that an ordinance, measure, enactment, rule,
  5 13 resolution, motion, or policy of a political subdivision of

  5 17 is void.
  5 18    The bill shall not be construed to prevent a law enforcement

  6  1 from adopting or enforcing rules of operation and use for a

  5  1 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  5  2 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  5  3    Current Code section 724.28 prohibits a political
  5  4 subdivision of the state from enacting an ordinance

  5  6 transportation, registration, or licensing of firearms when the
  5  7 ownership, possession, transfer, or transportation is otherwise
  5  8 lawful under state law.
  5  9    This bill strikes and rewrites this Code section to provide
  5 10 that the regulation of firearms, firearm accessories, and
  5 11 ammunition is declared to be the exclusive domain of the state.
  5 12 The bill provides that an ordinance, measure, enactment, rule,
  5 13 resolution, motion, or policy of a political subdivision of
  5 14 this state, or an official action of an employee or agent of
  5 15 such political subdivision, including through any legislative,

  5 17 is void.
  5 18    The bill shall not be construed to prevent a law enforcement

  5 30 businesses along with other businesses, provided that an
  5 31 ordinance which is designed or enforced to effectively restrict
  5 32 or prohibit the sale, purchase, transfer, manufacture, or
  5 33 display of firearms, firearm accessories, or ammunition
  5 34 otherwise lawful under the laws of this state, which is in
  5 35 conflict with the bill, is void; a political subdivision
  6  1 from adopting or enforcing rules of operation and use for a
  6  2 shooting range owned or operated by the political subdivision;
  6  3 and a political subdivision that sponsors or conducts any
  6  4 firearm=related competition or educational or cultural program
  6  5 from adopting rules of attendance for such a program.
  6  6    The bill provides that if a political subdivision violates
  6  7 the bill, the court shall declare the ordinance, measure,
  6  8 enactment, rule, resolution, motion, or policy void and issue
  6  9 a permanent injunction against the political subdivision

  6 14 up to $5,000 against the elected or appointed local government
  6 15 official or employee or agent of an administrative agency
  6 16 under whose jurisdiction the violation occurred if a violation
  6 17 was knowing and willful. In addition, knowing and willful
  6 18 violations by a person acting in an official capacity shall be

  5  6 transportation, registration, or licensing of firearms when the
  5  7 ownership, possession, transfer, or transportation is otherwise
  5  8 lawful under state law.
  5  9    This bill strikes and rewrites this Code section to provide
  5 10 that the regulation of firearms, firearm accessories, and
  5 11 ammunition is declared to be the exclusive domain of the state.
  5 12 The bill provides that an ordinance, measure, enactment, rule,
  5 13 resolution, motion, or policy of a political subdivision of

  5 17 is void.
  5 18    The bill shall not be construed to prevent a law enforcement

  5 30 businesses along with other businesses, provided that an
  5 31 ordinance which is designed or enforced to effectively restrict
  5 32 or prohibit the sale, purchase, transfer, manufacture, or
  5 33 display of firearms, firearm accessories, or ammunition
  5 34 otherwise lawful under the laws of this state, which is in
  5 35 conflict with the bill, is void; a political subdivision
  6  1 from adopting or enforcing rules of operation and use for a
  6  2 shooting range owned or operated by the political subdivision;
  6  3 and a political subdivision that sponsors or conducts any
  6  4 firearm=related competition or educational or cultural program
  6  5 from adopting rules of attendance for such a program.

  6 15 official or employee or agent of an administrative agency
  6 16 under whose jurisdiction the violation occurred if a violation
  6 17 was knowing and willful. In addition, knowing and willful
  6 18 violations by a person acting in an official capacity shall be
  6 19 cause for termination or removal.

  6 21 ordinance, measure, enactment, rule, resolution, motion, or
  6 22 policy adopted or enforced in violation of the bill may file
  6 23 suit in the appropriate court for declarative and injunctive
  6 24 relief and for damages and may, if successful, be awarded

  4 35                           EXPLANATION
  5  1 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  5  2 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  5  3    Current Code section 724.28 prohibits a political
  5  4 subdivision of the state from enacting an ordinance
  5  5 restricting the ownership, possession, legal transfer, lawful
  5  6 transportation, registration, or licensing of firearms when the
  5  7 ownership, possession, transfer, or transportation is otherwise
  5  8 lawful under state law.
  5  9    This bill strikes and rewrites this Code section to provide
  5 10 that the regulation of firearms, firearm accessories, and
  5 11 ammunition is declared to be the exclusive domain of the state.
  5 12 The bill provides that an ordinance, measure, enactment, rule,
  5 13 resolution, motion, or policy of a political subdivision of
  5 14 this state, or an official action of an employee or agent of
  5 15 such political subdivision, including through any legislative,
  5 16 police power, or proprietary capacity, in violation of the bill
  5 17 is void.
  5 18    The bill shall not be construed to prevent a law enforcement
  5 19 agency of a political subdivision from adopting and enforcing
  5 20 rules pertaining to firearms, firearm accessories, or
  5 21 ammunition issued to or used by peace officers in the course
  5 22 of their official duties; an employer from regulating or
  5 23 prohibiting an employee from carrying or possessing firearms,
  5 24 firearm accessories, or ammunition during and in the course
  5 25 of the employee's official duties; a court or administrative
  5 26 law judge from hearing and resolving a case or controversy or
  5 27 issuing an opinion or order on a matter within the court's or
  5 28 the judge's jurisdiction; enacting or enforcing a generally
  5 29 applicable zoning or business ordinance that includes firearms
  5 30 businesses along with other businesses, provided that an
  5 31 ordinance which is designed or enforced to effectively restrict
  5 32 or prohibit the sale, purchase, transfer, manufacture, or
  5 33 display of firearms, firearm accessories, or ammunition
  5 34 otherwise lawful under the laws of this state, which is in
  5 35 conflict with the bill, is void; a political subdivision
  6  1 from adopting or enforcing rules of operation and use for a
  6  2 shooting range owned or operated by the political subdivision;
  6  3 and a political subdivision that sponsors or conducts any
  6  4 firearm=related competition or educational or cultural program
  6  5 from adopting rules of attendance for such a program.
  6  6    The bill provides that if a political subdivision violates
  6  7 the bill, the court shall declare the ordinance, measure,
  6  8 enactment, rule, resolution, motion, or policy void and issue
  6  9 a permanent injunction against the political subdivision
  6 10 prohibiting enforcement of such ordinance, measure, enactment,
  6 11 rule, resolution, motion, or policy.  It is not a defense that
  6 12 the political subdivision was acting in good faith or upon the
  6 13 advice of counsel. The court shall assess a civil penalty of
  6 14 up to $5,000 against the elected or appointed local government
  6 15 official or employee or agent of an administrative agency
  6 16 under whose jurisdiction the violation occurred if a violation
  6 17 was knowing and willful. In addition, knowing and willful
  6 18 violations by a person acting in an official capacity shall be
  6 19 cause for termination or removal.
  6 20    The bill provides that a person adversely affected by an
  6 21 ordinance, measure, enactment, rule, resolution, motion, or
  6 22 policy adopted or enforced in violation of the bill may file
  6 23 suit in the appropriate court for declarative and injunctive
  6 24 relief and for damages and may, if successful, be awarded
  6 25 reasonable attorney fees and costs and the greater of actual
  6 26 damages or liquidated damages equal to the amount of three
  6 27 times the attorney fees awarded.
  6 28    The bill applies to any ordinance, measure, enactment,
  6 29 rule, resolution, motion, or policy adopted by a political
  6 30 subdivision of this state or to official actions taken by any
  6 31 employee or agent of such political subdivision, on or after
  6 32 the effective date of the bill. The penalties and remedies of

  4 35                           EXPLANATION
  5  1 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  5  2 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  5  3    Current Code section 724.28 prohibits a political
  5  4 subdivision of the state from enacting an ordinance
  5  5 restricting the ownership, possession, legal transfer, lawful
  5  6 transportation, registration, or licensing of firearms when the
  5  7 ownership, possession, transfer, or transportation is otherwise
  5  8 lawful under state law.
  5  9    This bill strikes and rewrites this Code section to provide
  5 10 that the regulation of firearms, firearm accessories, and
  5 11 ammunition is declared to be the exclusive domain of the state.
  5 12 The bill provides that an ordinance, measure, enactment, rule,
  5 13 resolution, motion, or policy of a political subdivision of
  5 14 this state, or an official action of an employee or agent of
  5 15 such political subdivision, including through any legislative,
  5 16 police power, or proprietary capacity, in violation of the bill
  5 17 is void.
  5 18    The bill shall not be construed to prevent a law enforcement
  5 19 agency of a political subdivision from adopting and enforcing
  5 20 rules pertaining to firearms, firearm accessories, or
  5 21 ammunition issued to or used by peace officers in the course
  5 22 of their official duties; an employer from regulating or
  5 23 prohibiting an employee from carrying or possessing firearms,
  5 24 firearm accessories, or ammunition during and in the course
  5 25 of the employee's official duties; a court or administrative
  5 26 law judge from hearing and resolving a case or controversy or
  5 27 issuing an opinion or order on a matter within the court's or
  5 28 the judge's jurisdiction; enacting or enforcing a generally
  5 29 applicable zoning or business ordinance that includes firearms
  5 30 businesses along with other businesses, provided that an
  5 31 ordinance which is designed or enforced to effectively restrict
  5 32 or prohibit the sale, purchase, transfer, manufacture, or
  5 33 display of firearms, firearm accessories, or ammunition
  5 34 otherwise lawful under the laws of this state, which is in
  5 35 conflict with the bill, is void; a political subdivision
  6  1 from adopting or enforcing rules of operation and use for a
  6  2 shooting range owned or operated by the political subdivision;
  6  3 and a political subdivision that sponsors or conducts any
  6  4 firearm=related competition or educational or cultural program
  6  5 from adopting rules of attendance for such a program.
  6  6    The bill provides that if a political subdivision violates
  6  7 the bill, the court shall declare the ordinance, measure,
  6  8 enactment, rule, resolution, motion, or policy void and issue
  6  9 a permanent injunction against the political subdivision
  6 10 prohibiting enforcement of such ordinance, measure, enactment,
  6 11 rule, resolution, motion, or policy.  It is not a defense that
  6 12 the political subdivision was acting in good faith or upon the
  6 13 advice of counsel. The court shall assess a civil penalty of
  6 14 up to $5,000 against the elected or appointed local government
  6 15 official or employee or agent of an administrative agency
  6 16 under whose jurisdiction the violation occurred if a violation
  6 17 was knowing and willful. In addition, knowing and willful
  6 18 violations by a person acting in an official capacity shall be
  6 19 cause for termination or removal.
  6 20    The bill provides that a person adversely affected by an
  6 21 ordinance, measure, enactment, rule, resolution, motion, or
  6 22 policy adopted or enforced in violation of the bill may file
  6 23 suit in the appropriate court for declarative and injunctive
  6 24 relief and for damages and may, if successful, be awarded
  6 25 reasonable attorney fees and costs and the greater of actual
  6 26 damages or liquidated damages equal to the amount of three
  6 27 times the attorney fees awarded.
  6 28    The bill applies to any ordinance, measure, enactment,
  6 29 rule, resolution, motion, or policy adopted by a political
  6 30 subdivision of this state or to official actions taken by any
  6 31 employee or agent of such political subdivision, on or after
  6 32 the effective date of the bill. The penalties and remedies of
  6 33 the bill shall first be imposed 90 days after the effective
  6 34 date of the bill.

  5  4 subdivision of the state from enacting an ordinance
  5  5 restricting the ownership, possession, legal transfer, lawful
  5  6 transportation, registration, or licensing of firearms when the
  5  7 ownership, possession, transfer, or transportation is otherwise
  5  8 lawful under state law.
  5  9    This bill strikes and rewrites this Code section to provide
  5 10 that the regulation of firearms, firearm accessories, and
  5 11 ammunition is declared to be the exclusive domain of the state.
  5 12 The bill provides that an ordinance, measure, enactment, rule,
  5 13 resolution, motion, or policy of a political subdivision of
  5 14 this state, or an official action of an employee or agent of
  5 15 such political subdivision, including through any legislative,
  5 16 police power, or proprietary capacity, in violation of the bill
  5 17 is void.
  5 18    The bill shall not be construed to prevent a law enforcement
  5 19 agency of a political subdivision from adopting and enforcing
  5 20 rules pertaining to firearms, firearm accessories, or
  5 21 ammunition issued to or used by peace officers in the course
  5 22 of their official duties; an employer from regulating or
  5 23 prohibiting an employee from carrying or possessing firearms,
  5 24 firearm accessories, or ammunition during and in the course
  5 25 of the employee's official duties; a court or administrative
  5 26 law judge from hearing and resolving a case or controversy or
  5 27 issuing an opinion or order on a matter within the court's or
  5 28 the judge's jurisdiction; enacting or enforcing a generally
  5 29 applicable zoning or business ordinance that includes firearms
  5 30 businesses along with other businesses, provided that an
  5 31 ordinance which is designed or enforced to effectively restrict
  5 32 or prohibit the sale, purchase, transfer, manufacture, or
  5 33 display of firearms, firearm accessories, or ammunition
  5 34 otherwise lawful under the laws of this state, which is in
  5 35 conflict with the bill, is void; a political subdivision
  6  1 from adopting or enforcing rules of operation and use for a
  6  2 shooting range owned or operated by the political subdivision;
  6  3 and a political subdivision that sponsors or conducts any
  6  4 firearm=related competition or educational or cultural program
  6  5 from adopting rules of attendance for such a program.
  6  6    The bill provides that if a political subdivision violates
  6  7 the bill, the court shall declare the ordinance, measure,
  6  8 enactment, rule, resolution, motion, or policy void and issue
  6  9 a permanent injunction against the political subdivision
  6 10 prohibiting enforcement of such ordinance, measure, enactment,
  6 11 rule, resolution, motion, or policy.  It is not a defense that
  6 12 the political subdivision was acting in good faith or upon the
  6 13 advice of counsel. The court shall assess a civil penalty of
  6 14 up to $5,000 against the elected or appointed local government
  6 15 official or employee or agent of an administrative agency
  6 16 under whose jurisdiction the violation occurred if a violation
  6 17 was knowing and willful. In addition, knowing and willful
  6 18 violations by a person acting in an official capacity shall be
  6 19 cause for termination or removal.
  6 20    The bill provides that a person adversely affected by an
  6 21 ordinance, measure, enactment, rule, resolution, motion, or
  6 22 policy adopted or enforced in violation of the bill may file
  6 23 suit in the appropriate court for declarative and injunctive
  6 24 relief and for damages and may, if successful, be awarded
  6 25 reasonable attorney fees and costs and the greater of actual
  6 26 damages or liquidated damages equal to the amount of three
  6 27 times the attorney fees awarded.
  6 28    The bill applies to any ordinance, measure, enactment,
  6 29 rule, resolution, motion, or policy adopted by a political
  6 30 subdivision of this state or to official actions taken by any
  6 31 employee or agent of such political subdivision, on or after
  6 32 the effective date of the bill. The penalties and remedies of
  6 33 the bill shall first be imposed 90 days after the effective
  6 34 date of the bill.

  5 17 is void.

  4 35                           EXPLANATION
  5  1 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  5  2 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  5  3    Current Code section 724.28 prohibits a political
  5  4 subdivision of the state from enacting an ordinance
  5  5 restricting the ownership, possession, legal transfer, lawful
  5  6 transportation, registration, or licensing of firearms when the
  5  7 ownership, possession, transfer, or transportation is otherwise
  5  8 lawful under state law.
  5  9    This bill strikes and rewrites this Code section to provide
  5 10 that the regulation of firearms, firearm accessories, and
  5 11 ammunition is declared to be the exclusive domain of the state.
  5 12 The bill provides that an ordinance, measure, enactment, rule,
  5 13 resolution, motion, or policy of a political subdivision of
  5 14 this state, or an official action of an employee or agent of
  5 15 such political subdivision, including through any legislative,
  5 16 police power, or proprietary capacity, in violation of the bill
  5 17 is void.
  5 18    The bill shall not be construed to prevent a law enforcement
  5 19 agency of a political subdivision from adopting and enforcing
  5 20 rules pertaining to firearms, firearm accessories, or
  5 21 ammunition issued to or used by peace officers in the course
  5 22 of their official duties; an employer from regulating or
  5 23 prohibiting an employee from carrying or possessing firearms,
  5 24 firearm accessories, or ammunition during and in the course
  5 25 of the employee's official duties; a court or administrative
  5 26 law judge from hearing and resolving a case or controversy or
  5 27 issuing an opinion or order on a matter within the court's or
  5 28 the judge's jurisdiction; enacting or enforcing a generally
  5 29 applicable zoning or business ordinance that includes firearms
  5 30 businesses along with other businesses, provided that an
  5 31 ordinance which is designed or enforced to effectively restrict
  5 32 or prohibit the sale, purchase, transfer, manufacture, or
  5 33 display of firearms, firearm accessories, or ammunition
  5 34 otherwise lawful under the laws of this state, which is in
  5 35 conflict with the bill, is void; a political subdivision
  6  1 from adopting or enforcing rules of operation and use for a
  6  2 shooting range owned or operated by the political subdivision;
  6  3 and a political subdivision that sponsors or conducts any
  6  4 firearm=related competition or educational or cultural program
  6  5 from adopting rules of attendance for such a program.
  6  6    The bill provides that if a political subdivision violates
  6  7 the bill, the court shall declare the ordinance, measure,
  6  8 enactment, rule, resolution, motion, or policy void and issue
  6  9 a permanent injunction against the political subdivision
  6 10 prohibiting enforcement of such ordinance, measure, enactment,
  6 11 rule, resolution, motion, or policy.  It is not a defense that
  6 12 the political subdivision was acting in good faith or upon the
  6 13 advice of counsel. The court shall assess a civil penalty of
  6 14 up to $5,000 against the elected or appointed local government
  6 15 official or employee or agent of an administrative agency
  6 16 under whose jurisdiction the violation occurred if a violation
  6 17 was knowing and willful. In addition, knowing and willful
  6 18 violations by a person acting in an official capacity shall be
  6 19 cause for termination or removal.
  6 20    The bill provides that a person adversely affected by an
  6 21 ordinance, measure, enactment, rule, resolution, motion, or
  6 22 policy adopted or enforced in violation of the bill may file
  6 23 suit in the appropriate court for declarative and injunctive
  6 24 relief and for damages and may, if successful, be awarded
  6 25 reasonable attorney fees and costs and the greater of actual
  6 26 damages or liquidated damages equal to the amount of three
  6 27 times the attorney fees awarded.
  6 28    The bill applies to any ordinance, measure, enactment,
  6 29 rule, resolution, motion, or policy adopted by a political
  6 30 subdivision of this state or to official actions taken by any
  6 31 employee or agent of such political subdivision, on or after

  4 35                           EXPLANATION
  5  1 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  5  2 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  5  3    Current Code section 724.28 prohibits a political
  5  4 subdivision of the state from enacting an ordinance
  5  5 restricting the ownership, possession, legal transfer, lawful
  5  6 transportation, registration, or licensing of firearms when the
  5  7 ownership, possession, transfer, or transportation is otherwise
  5  8 lawful under state law.
  5  9    This bill strikes and rewrites this Code section to provide
  5 10 that the regulation of firearms, firearm accessories, and
  5 11 ammunition is declared to be the exclusive domain of the state.
  5 12 The bill provides that an ordinance, measure, enactment, rule,
  5 13 resolution, motion, or policy of a political subdivision of
  5 14 this state, or an official action of an employee or agent of
  5 15 such political subdivision, including through any legislative,
  5 16 police power, or proprietary capacity, in violation of the bill
  5 17 is void.
  5 18    The bill shall not be construed to prevent a law enforcement
  5 19 agency of a political subdivision from adopting and enforcing
  5 20 rules pertaining to firearms, firearm accessories, or
  5 21 ammunition issued to or used by peace officers in the course
  5 22 of their official duties; an employer from regulating or
  5 23 prohibiting an employee from carrying or possessing firearms,
  5 24 firearm accessories, or ammunition during and in the course
  5 25 of the employee's official duties; a court or administrative
  5 26 law judge from hearing and resolving a case or controversy or
  5 27 issuing an opinion or order on a matter within the court's or
  5 28 the judge's jurisdiction; enacting or enforcing a generally
  5 29 applicable zoning or business ordinance that includes firearms
  5 30 businesses along with other businesses, provided that an
  5 31 ordinance which is designed or enforced to effectively restrict
  5 32 or prohibit the sale, purchase, transfer, manufacture, or
  5 33 display of firearms, firearm accessories, or ammunition
  5 34 otherwise lawful under the laws of this state, which is in
  5 35 conflict with the bill, is void; a political subdivision
  6  1 from adopting or enforcing rules of operation and use for a
  6  2 shooting range owned or operated by the political subdivision;
  6  3 and a political subdivision that sponsors or conducts any
  6  4 firearm=related competition or educational or cultural program
  6  5 from adopting rules of attendance for such a program.
  6  6    The bill provides that if a political subdivision violates
  6  7 the bill, the court shall declare the ordinance, measure,
  6  8 enactment, rule, resolution, motion, or policy void and issue
  6  9 a permanent injunction against the political subdivision
  6 10 prohibiting enforcement of such ordinance, measure, enactment,
  6 11 rule, resolution, motion, or policy.  It is not a defense that
  6 12 the political subdivision was acting in good faith or upon the
  6 13 advice of counsel. The court shall assess a civil penalty of
  6 14 up to $5,000 against the elected or appointed local government
  6 15 official or employee or agent of an administrative agency
  6 16 under whose jurisdiction the violation occurred if a violation
  6 17 was knowing and willful. In addition, knowing and willful
  6 18 violations by a person acting in an official capacity shall be
  6 19 cause for termination or removal.
  6 20    The bill provides that a person adversely affected by an
  6 21 ordinance, measure, enactment, rule, resolution, motion, or
  6 22 policy adopted or enforced in violation of the bill may file
  6 23 suit in the appropriate court for declarative and injunctive
  6 24 relief and for damages and may, if successful, be awarded
  6 25 reasonable attorney fees and costs and the greater of actual
  6 26 damages or liquidated damages equal to the amount of three
  6 27 times the attorney fees awarded.
  6 28    The bill applies to any ordinance, measure, enactment,
  6 29 rule, resolution, motion, or policy adopted by a political
  6 30 subdivision of this state or to official actions taken by any
  6 31 employee or agent of such political subdivision, on or after
  6 32 the effective date of the bill. The penalties and remedies of
  6 33 the bill shall first be imposed 90 days after the effective
  6 34 date of the bill.

  5 12 The bill provides that an ordinance, measure, enactment, rule,

  5 12 The bill provides that an ordinance, measure, enactment, rule,

  5  1 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  5  2 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  5  3    Current Code section 724.28 prohibits a political
  5  4 subdivision of the state from enacting an ordinance
  5  5 restricting the ownership, possession, legal transfer, lawful
  5  6 transportation, registration, or licensing of firearms when the
  5  7 ownership, possession, transfer, or transportation is otherwise
  5  8 lawful under state law.
  5  9    This bill strikes and rewrites this Code section to provide
  5 10 that the regulation of firearms, firearm accessories, and
  5 11 ammunition is declared to be the exclusive domain of the state.
  5 12 The bill provides that an ordinance, measure, enactment, rule,
  5 13 resolution, motion, or policy of a political subdivision of
  5 14 this state, or an official action of an employee or agent of
  5 15 such political subdivision, including through any legislative,
  5 16 police power, or proprietary capacity, in violation of the bill
  5 17 is void.
  5 18    The bill shall not be construed to prevent a law enforcement
  5 19 agency of a political subdivision from adopting and enforcing
  5 20 rules pertaining to firearms, firearm accessories, or
  5 21 ammunition issued to or used by peace officers in the course
  5 22 of their official duties; an employer from regulating or
  5 23 prohibiting an employee from carrying or possessing firearms,
  5 24 firearm accessories, or ammunition during and in the course
  5 25 of the employee's official duties; a court or administrative
  5 26 law judge from hearing and resolving a case or controversy or
  5 27 issuing an opinion or order on a matter within the court's or
  5 28 the judge's jurisdiction; enacting or enforcing a generally
  5 29 applicable zoning or business ordinance that includes firearms
  5 30 businesses along with other businesses, provided that an
  5 31 ordinance which is designed or enforced to effectively restrict
  5 32 or prohibit the sale, purchase, transfer, manufacture, or
  5 33 display of firearms, firearm accessories, or ammunition
  5 34 otherwise lawful under the laws of this state, which is in
  5 35 conflict with the bill, is void; a political subdivision
  6  1 from adopting or enforcing rules of operation and use for a
  6  2 shooting range owned or operated by the political subdivision;
  6  3 and a political subdivision that sponsors or conducts any
  6  4 firearm=related competition or educational or cultural program
  6  5 from adopting rules of attendance for such a program.
  6  6    The bill provides that if a political subdivision violates
  6  7 the bill, the court shall declare the ordinance, measure,
  6  8 enactment, rule, resolution, motion, or policy void and issue
  6  9 a permanent injunction against the political subdivision
  6 10 prohibiting enforcement of such ordinance, measure, enactment,
  6 11 rule, resolution, motion, or policy.  It is not a defense that
  6 12 the political subdivision was acting in good faith or upon the
  6 13 advice of counsel. The court shall assess a civil penalty of
  6 14 up to $5,000 against the elected or appointed local government
  6 15 official or employee or agent of an administrative agency
  6 16 under whose jurisdiction the violation occurred if a violation
  6 17 was knowing and willful. In addition, knowing and willful
  6 18 violations by a person acting in an official capacity shall be
  6 19 cause for termination or removal.
  6 20    The bill provides that a person adversely affected by an
  6 21 ordinance, measure, enactment, rule, resolution, motion, or
  6 22 policy adopted or enforced in violation of the bill may file
  6 23 suit in the appropriate court for declarative and injunctive
  6 24 relief and for damages and may, if successful, be awarded

  6 28    The bill applies to any ordinance, measure, enactment,
  6 29 rule, resolution, motion, or policy adopted by a political
  6 30 subdivision of this state or to official actions taken by any
  6 31 employee or agent of such political subdivision, on or after

  4 35                           EXPLANATION
  5  1 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  5  2 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  5  3    Current Code section 724.28 prohibits a political
  5  4 subdivision of the state from enacting an ordinance
  5  5 restricting the ownership, possession, legal transfer, lawful
  5  6 transportation, registration, or licensing of firearms when the
  5  7 ownership, possession, transfer, or transportation is otherwise
  5  8 lawful under state law.
  5  9    This bill strikes and rewrites this Code section to provide
  5 10 that the regulation of firearms, firearm accessories, and
  5 11 ammunition is declared to be the exclusive domain of the state.
  5 12 The bill provides that an ordinance, measure, enactment, rule,
  5 13 resolution, motion, or policy of a political subdivision of
  5 14 this state, or an official action of an employee or agent of
  5 15 such political subdivision, including through any legislative,
  5 16 police power, or proprietary capacity, in violation of the bill
  5 17 is void.
  5 18    The bill shall not be construed to prevent a law enforcement
  5 19 agency of a political subdivision from adopting and enforcing
  5 20 rules pertaining to firearms, firearm accessories, or
  5 21 ammunition issued to or used by peace officers in the course
  5 22 of their official duties; an employer from regulating or
  5 23 prohibiting an employee from carrying or possessing firearms,
  5 24 firearm accessories, or ammunition during and in the course
  5 25 of the employee's official duties; a court or administrative
  5 26 law judge from hearing and resolving a case or controversy or
  5 27 issuing an opinion or order on a matter within the court's or
  5 28 the judge's jurisdiction; enacting or enforcing a generally
  5 29 applicable zoning or business ordinance that includes firearms
  5 30 businesses along with other businesses, provided that an
  5 31 ordinance which is designed or enforced to effectively restrict
  5 32 or prohibit the sale, purchase, transfer, manufacture, or
  5 33 display of firearms, firearm accessories, or ammunition
  5 34 otherwise lawful under the laws of this state, which is in
  5 35 conflict with the bill, is void; a political subdivision
  6  1 from adopting or enforcing rules of operation and use for a
  6  2 shooting range owned or operated by the political subdivision;
  6  3 and a political subdivision that sponsors or conducts any
  6  4 firearm=related competition or educational or cultural program
  6  5 from adopting rules of attendance for such a program.
  6  6    The bill provides that if a political subdivision violates
  6  7 the bill, the court shall declare the ordinance, measure,
  6  8 enactment, rule, resolution, motion, or policy void and issue
  6  9 a permanent injunction against the political subdivision
  6 10 prohibiting enforcement of such ordinance, measure, enactment,
  6 11 rule, resolution, motion, or policy.  It is not a defense that
  6 12 the political subdivision was acting in good faith or upon the
  6 13 advice of counsel. The court shall assess a civil penalty of
  6 14 up to $5,000 against the elected or appointed local government
  6 15 official or employee or agent of an administrative agency
  6 16 under whose jurisdiction the violation occurred if a violation
  6 17 was knowing and willful. In addition, knowing and willful
  6 18 violations by a person acting in an official capacity shall be
  6 19 cause for termination or removal.
  6 20    The bill provides that a person adversely affected by an
  6 21 ordinance, measure, enactment, rule, resolution, motion, or
  6 22 policy adopted or enforced in violation of the bill may file
  6 23 suit in the appropriate court for declarative and injunctive
  6 24 relief and for damages and may, if successful, be awarded
  6 25 reasonable attorney fees and costs and the greater of actual
  6 26 damages or liquidated damages equal to the amount of three
  6 27 times the attorney fees awarded.
  6 28    The bill applies to any ordinance, measure, enactment,
  6 29 rule, resolution, motion, or policy adopted by a political
  6 30 subdivision of this state or to official actions taken by any
  6 31 employee or agent of such political subdivision, on or after
  6 32 the effective date of the bill. The penalties and remedies of
  6 33 the bill shall first be imposed 90 days after the effective
  6 34 date of the bill.

  5  6 transportation, registration, or licensing of firearms when the
  5  7 ownership, possession, transfer, or transportation is otherwise
  5  8 lawful under state law.
  5  9    This bill strikes and rewrites this Code section to provide
  5 10 that the regulation of firearms, firearm accessories, and
  5 11 ammunition is declared to be the exclusive domain of the state.
  5 12 The bill provides that an ordinance, measure, enactment, rule,
  5 13 resolution, motion, or policy of a political subdivision of

  5 17 is void.
  5 18    The bill shall not be construed to prevent a law enforcement

  5 34 otherwise lawful under the laws of this state, which is in

  4 35                           EXPLANATION
  5  1 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  5  2 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  5  3    Current Code section 724.28 prohibits a political
  5  4 subdivision of the state from enacting an ordinance
  5  5 restricting the ownership, possession, legal transfer, lawful
  5  6 transportation, registration, or licensing of firearms when the
  5  7 ownership, possession, transfer, or transportation is otherwise
  5  8 lawful under state law.
  5  9    This bill strikes and rewrites this Code section to provide
  5 10 that the regulation of firearms, firearm accessories, and
  5 11 ammunition is declared to be the exclusive domain of the state.
  5 12 The bill provides that an ordinance, measure, enactment, rule,
  5 13 resolution, motion, or policy of a political subdivision of
  5 14 this state, or an official action of an employee or agent of
  5 15 such political subdivision, including through any legislative,
  5 16 police power, or proprietary capacity, in violation of the bill
  5 17 is void.
  5 18    The bill shall not be construed to prevent a law enforcement
  5 19 agency of a political subdivision from adopting and enforcing
  5 20 rules pertaining to firearms, firearm accessories, or
  5 21 ammunition issued to or used by peace officers in the course
  5 22 of their official duties; an employer from regulating or
  5 23 prohibiting an employee from carrying or possessing firearms,
  5 24 firearm accessories, or ammunition during and in the course
  5 25 of the employee's official duties; a court or administrative
  5 26 law judge from hearing and resolving a case or controversy or
  5 27 issuing an opinion or order on a matter within the court's or
  5 28 the judge's jurisdiction; enacting or enforcing a generally
  5 29 applicable zoning or business ordinance that includes firearms
  5 30 businesses along with other businesses, provided that an
  5 31 ordinance which is designed or enforced to effectively restrict
  5 32 or prohibit the sale, purchase, transfer, manufacture, or
  5 33 display of firearms, firearm accessories, or ammunition
  5 34 otherwise lawful under the laws of this state, which is in
  5 35 conflict with the bill, is void; a political subdivision
  6  1 from adopting or enforcing rules of operation and use for a
  6  2 shooting range owned or operated by the political subdivision;
  6  3 and a political subdivision that sponsors or conducts any
  6  4 firearm=related competition or educational or cultural program
  6  5 from adopting rules of attendance for such a program.
  6  6    The bill provides that if a political subdivision violates
  6  7 the bill, the court shall declare the ordinance, measure,
  6  8 enactment, rule, resolution, motion, or policy void and issue
  6  9 a permanent injunction against the political subdivision
  6 10 prohibiting enforcement of such ordinance, measure, enactment,
  6 11 rule, resolution, motion, or policy.  It is not a defense that
  6 12 the political subdivision was acting in good faith or upon the
  6 13 advice of counsel. The court shall assess a civil penalty of
  6 14 up to $5,000 against the elected or appointed local government
  6 15 official or employee or agent of an administrative agency
  6 16 under whose jurisdiction the violation occurred if a violation
  6 17 was knowing and willful. In addition, knowing and willful
  6 18 violations by a person acting in an official capacity shall be
  6 19 cause for termination or removal.

  6 21 ordinance, measure, enactment, rule, resolution, motion, or
  6 22 policy adopted or enforced in violation of the bill may file
  6 23 suit in the appropriate court for declarative and injunctive
  6 24 relief and for damages and may, if successful, be awarded

  5  8 lawful under state law.
  5  9    This bill strikes and rewrites this Code section to provide
  5 10 that the regulation of firearms, firearm accessories, and
  5 11 ammunition is declared to be the exclusive domain of the state.
  5 12 The bill provides that an ordinance, measure, enactment, rule,
  5 13 resolution, motion, or policy of a political subdivision of

  5 17 is void.
  5 18    The bill shall not be construed to prevent a law enforcement

  4 35                           EXPLANATION
  5  1 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  5  2 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  5  3    Current Code section 724.28 prohibits a political
  5  4 subdivision of the state from enacting an ordinance
  5  5 restricting the ownership, possession, legal transfer, lawful
  5  6 transportation, registration, or licensing of firearms when the
  5  7 ownership, possession, transfer, or transportation is otherwise
  5  8 lawful under state law.
  5  9    This bill strikes and rewrites this Code section to provide
  5 10 that the regulation of firearms, firearm accessories, and
  5 11 ammunition is declared to be the exclusive domain of the state.
  5 12 The bill provides that an ordinance, measure, enactment, rule,
  5 13 resolution, motion, or policy of a political subdivision of
  5 14 this state, or an official action of an employee or agent of
  5 15 such political subdivision, including through any legislative,
  5 16 police power, or proprietary capacity, in violation of the bill
  5 17 is void.
  5 18    The bill shall not be construed to prevent a law enforcement
  5 19 agency of a political subdivision from adopting and enforcing
  5 20 rules pertaining to firearms, firearm accessories, or
  5 21 ammunition issued to or used by peace officers in the course
  5 22 of their official duties; an employer from regulating or
  5 23 prohibiting an employee from carrying or possessing firearms,
  5 24 firearm accessories, or ammunition during and in the course
  5 25 of the employee's official duties; a court or administrative
  5 26 law judge from hearing and resolving a case or controversy or
  5 27 issuing an opinion or order on a matter within the court's or
  5 28 the judge's jurisdiction; enacting or enforcing a generally
  5 29 applicable zoning or business ordinance that includes firearms
  5 30 businesses along with other businesses, provided that an
  5 31 ordinance which is designed or enforced to effectively restrict
  5 32 or prohibit the sale, purchase, transfer, manufacture, or
  5 33 display of firearms, firearm accessories, or ammunition
  5 34 otherwise lawful under the laws of this state, which is in
  5 35 conflict with the bill, is void; a political subdivision
  6  1 from adopting or enforcing rules of operation and use for a
  6  2 shooting range owned or operated by the political subdivision;
  6  3 and a political subdivision that sponsors or conducts any
  6  4 firearm=related competition or educational or cultural program
  6  5 from adopting rules of attendance for such a program.
  6  6    The bill provides that if a political subdivision violates
  6  7 the bill, the court shall declare the ordinance, measure,
  6  8 enactment, rule, resolution, motion, or policy void and issue
  6  9 a permanent injunction against the political subdivision
  6 10 prohibiting enforcement of such ordinance, measure, enactment,
  6 11 rule, resolution, motion, or policy.  It is not a defense that
  6 12 the political subdivision was acting in good faith or upon the
  6 13 advice of counsel. The court shall assess a civil penalty of
  6 14 up to $5,000 against the elected or appointed local government
  6 15 official or employee or agent of an administrative agency
  6 16 under whose jurisdiction the violation occurred if a violation
  6 17 was knowing and willful. In addition, knowing and willful
  6 18 violations by a person acting in an official capacity shall be
  6 19 cause for termination or removal.
  6 20    The bill provides that a person adversely affected by an
  6 21 ordinance, measure, enactment, rule, resolution, motion, or
  6 22 policy adopted or enforced in violation of the bill may file
  6 23 suit in the appropriate court for declarative and injunctive
  6 24 relief and for damages and may, if successful, be awarded
  6 25 reasonable attorney fees and costs and the greater of actual
  6 26 damages or liquidated damages equal to the amount of three
  6 27 times the attorney fees awarded.
  6 28    The bill applies to any ordinance, measure, enactment,

  6 30 subdivision of this state or to official actions taken by any
  6 31 employee or agent of such political subdivision, on or after

  5  6 transportation, registration, or licensing of firearms when the
  5  7 ownership, possession, transfer, or transportation is otherwise
  5  8 lawful under state law.
  5  9    This bill strikes and rewrites this Code section to provide
  5 10 that the regulation of firearms, firearm accessories, and
  5 11 ammunition is declared to be the exclusive domain of the state.
  5 12 The bill provides that an ordinance, measure, enactment, rule,
  5 13 resolution, motion, or policy of a political subdivision of
  5 14 this state, or an official action of an employee or agent of
  5 15 such political subdivision, including through any legislative,

  5 17 is void.
  5 18    The bill shall not be construed to prevent a law enforcement

  5 27 issuing an opinion or order on a matter within the court's or
  5 28 the judge's jurisdiction; enacting or enforcing a generally
  5 29 applicable zoning or business ordinance that includes firearms
  5 30 businesses along with other businesses, provided that an
  5 31 ordinance which is designed or enforced to effectively restrict
  5 32 or prohibit the sale, purchase, transfer, manufacture, or
  5 33 display of firearms, firearm accessories, or ammunition
  5 34 otherwise lawful under the laws of this state, which is in
  5 35 conflict with the bill, is void; a political subdivision
  6  1 from adopting or enforcing rules of operation and use for a
  6  2 shooting range owned or operated by the political subdivision;
  6  3 and a political subdivision that sponsors or conducts any
  6  4 firearm=related competition or educational or cultural program
  6  5 from adopting rules of attendance for such a program.
  6  6    The bill provides that if a political subdivision violates
  6  7 the bill, the court shall declare the ordinance, measure,
  6  8 enactment, rule, resolution, motion, or policy void and issue
  6  9 a permanent injunction against the political subdivision
  6 10 prohibiting enforcement of such ordinance, measure, enactment,
  6 11 rule, resolution, motion, or policy.  It is not a defense that

  6 13 advice of counsel. The court shall assess a civil penalty of
  6 14 up to $5,000 against the elected or appointed local government
  6 15 official or employee or agent of an administrative agency
  6 16 under whose jurisdiction the violation occurred if a violation
  6 17 was knowing and willful. In addition, knowing and willful
  6 18 violations by a person acting in an official capacity shall be
  6 19 cause for termination or removal.
  6 20    The bill provides that a person adversely affected by an
  6 21 ordinance, measure, enactment, rule, resolution, motion, or
  6 22 policy adopted or enforced in violation of the bill may file
  6 23 suit in the appropriate court for declarative and injunctive

  5  3    Current Code section 724.28 prohibits a political
  5  4 subdivision of the state from enacting an ordinance
  5  5 restricting the ownership, possession, legal transfer, lawful
  5  6 transportation, registration, or licensing of firearms when the
  5  7 ownership, possession, transfer, or transportation is otherwise
  5  8 lawful under state law.
  5  9    This bill strikes and rewrites this Code section to provide
  5 10 that the regulation of firearms, firearm accessories, and
  5 11 ammunition is declared to be the exclusive domain of the state.
  5 12 The bill provides that an ordinance, measure, enactment, rule,
  5 13 resolution, motion, or policy of a political subdivision of

  5 17 is void.

  5 34 otherwise lawful under the laws of this state, which is in

  6  9 a permanent injunction against the political subdivision

  4 35                           EXPLANATION
  5  1 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  5  2 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  5  3    Current Code section 724.28 prohibits a political
  5  4 subdivision of the state from enacting an ordinance
  5  5 restricting the ownership, possession, legal transfer, lawful
  5  6 transportation, registration, or licensing of firearms when the
  5  7 ownership, possession, transfer, or transportation is otherwise
  5  8 lawful under state law.
  5  9    This bill strikes and rewrites this Code section to provide
  5 10 that the regulation of firearms, firearm accessories, and
  5 11 ammunition is declared to be the exclusive domain of the state.
  5 12 The bill provides that an ordinance, measure, enactment, rule,
  5 13 resolution, motion, or policy of a political subdivision of
  5 14 this state, or an official action of an employee or agent of
  5 15 such political subdivision, including through any legislative,
  5 16 police power, or proprietary capacity, in violation of the bill
  5 17 is void.
  5 18    The bill shall not be construed to prevent a law enforcement
  5 19 agency of a political subdivision from adopting and enforcing
  5 20 rules pertaining to firearms, firearm accessories, or
  5 21 ammunition issued to or used by peace officers in the course
  5 22 of their official duties; an employer from regulating or
  5 23 prohibiting an employee from carrying or possessing firearms,
  5 24 firearm accessories, or ammunition during and in the course
  5 25 of the employee's official duties; a court or administrative
  5 26 law judge from hearing and resolving a case or controversy or
  5 27 issuing an opinion or order on a matter within the court's or
  5 28 the judge's jurisdiction; enacting or enforcing a generally
  5 29 applicable zoning or business ordinance that includes firearms
  5 30 businesses along with other businesses, provided that an
  5 31 ordinance which is designed or enforced to effectively restrict
  5 32 or prohibit the sale, purchase, transfer, manufacture, or
  5 33 display of firearms, firearm accessories, or ammunition
  5 34 otherwise lawful under the laws of this state, which is in
  5 35 conflict with the bill, is void; a political subdivision
  6  1 from adopting or enforcing rules of operation and use for a
  6  2 shooting range owned or operated by the political subdivision;
  6  3 and a political subdivision that sponsors or conducts any
  6  4 firearm=related competition or educational or cultural program
  6  5 from adopting rules of attendance for such a program.
  6  6    The bill provides that if a political subdivision violates
  6  7 the bill, the court shall declare the ordinance, measure,
  6  8 enactment, rule, resolution, motion, or policy void and issue
  6  9 a permanent injunction against the political subdivision
  6 10 prohibiting enforcement of such ordinance, measure, enactment,
  6 11 rule, resolution, motion, or policy.  It is not a defense that
  6 12 the political subdivision was acting in good faith or upon the
  6 13 advice of counsel. The court shall assess a civil penalty of
  6 14 up to $5,000 against the elected or appointed local government
  6 15 official or employee or agent of an administrative agency
  6 16 under whose jurisdiction the violation occurred if a violation
  6 17 was knowing and willful. In addition, knowing and willful
  6 18 violations by a person acting in an official capacity shall be
  6 19 cause for termination or removal.
  6 20    The bill provides that a person adversely affected by an
  6 21 ordinance, measure, enactment, rule, resolution, motion, or
  6 22 policy adopted or enforced in violation of the bill may file
  6 23 suit in the appropriate court for declarative and injunctive
  6 24 relief and for damages and may, if successful, be awarded
  6 25 reasonable attorney fees and costs and the greater of actual
  6 26 damages or liquidated damages equal to the amount of three
  6 27 times the attorney fees awarded.

  6 30 subdivision of this state or to official actions taken by any
  6 31 employee or agent of such political subdivision, on or after

  4 35                           EXPLANATION
  5  1 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  5  2 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  5  3    Current Code section 724.28 prohibits a political
  5  4 subdivision of the state from enacting an ordinance
  5  5 restricting the ownership, possession, legal transfer, lawful
  5  6 transportation, registration, or licensing of firearms when the
  5  7 ownership, possession, transfer, or transportation is otherwise
  5  8 lawful under state law.
  5  9    This bill strikes and rewrites this Code section to provide
  5 10 that the regulation of firearms, firearm accessories, and
  5 11 ammunition is declared to be the exclusive domain of the state.
  5 12 The bill provides that an ordinance, measure, enactment, rule,
  5 13 resolution, motion, or policy of a political subdivision of
  5 14 this state, or an official action of an employee or agent of
  5 15 such political subdivision, including through any legislative,
  5 16 police power, or proprietary capacity, in violation of the bill
  5 17 is void.
  5 18    The bill shall not be construed to prevent a law enforcement
  5 19 agency of a political subdivision from adopting and enforcing
  5 20 rules pertaining to firearms, firearm accessories, or
  5 21 ammunition issued to or used by peace officers in the course
  5 22 of their official duties; an employer from regulating or
  5 23 prohibiting an employee from carrying or possessing firearms,
  5 24 firearm accessories, or ammunition during and in the course
  5 25 of the employee's official duties; a court or administrative
  5 26 law judge from hearing and resolving a case or controversy or
  5 27 issuing an opinion or order on a matter within the court's or
  5 28 the judge's jurisdiction; enacting or enforcing a generally
  5 29 applicable zoning or business ordinance that includes firearms
  5 30 businesses along with other businesses, provided that an
  5 31 ordinance which is designed or enforced to effectively restrict
  5 32 or prohibit the sale, purchase, transfer, manufacture, or
  5 33 display of firearms, firearm accessories, or ammunition
  5 34 otherwise lawful under the laws of this state, which is in
  5 35 conflict with the bill, is void; a political subdivision
  6  1 from adopting or enforcing rules of operation and use for a
  6  2 shooting range owned or operated by the political subdivision;
  6  3 and a political subdivision that sponsors or conducts any
  6  4 firearm=related competition or educational or cultural program
  6  5 from adopting rules of attendance for such a program.
  6  6    The bill provides that if a political subdivision violates
  6  7 the bill, the court shall declare the ordinance, measure,
  6  8 enactment, rule, resolution, motion, or policy void and issue
  6  9 a permanent injunction against the political subdivision
  6 10 prohibiting enforcement of such ordinance, measure, enactment,
  6 11 rule, resolution, motion, or policy.  It is not a defense that
  6 12 the political subdivision was acting in good faith or upon the
  6 13 advice of counsel. The court shall assess a civil penalty of
  6 14 up to $5,000 against the elected or appointed local government
  6 15 official or employee or agent of an administrative agency
  6 16 under whose jurisdiction the violation occurred if a violation
  6 17 was knowing and willful. In addition, knowing and willful
  6 18 violations by a person acting in an official capacity shall be
  6 19 cause for termination or removal.
  6 20    The bill provides that a person adversely affected by an
  6 21 ordinance, measure, enactment, rule, resolution, motion, or
  6 22 policy adopted or enforced in violation of the bill may file
  6 23 suit in the appropriate court for declarative and injunctive
  6 24 relief and for damages and may, if successful, be awarded
  6 25 reasonable attorney fees and costs and the greater of actual
  6 26 damages or liquidated damages equal to the amount of three
  6 27 times the attorney fees awarded.
  6 28    The bill applies to any ordinance, measure, enactment,
  6 29 rule, resolution, motion, or policy adopted by a political
  6 30 subdivision of this state or to official actions taken by any
  6 31 employee or agent of such political subdivision, on or after

  5  6 transportation, registration, or licensing of firearms when the
  5  7 ownership, possession, transfer, or transportation is otherwise
  5  8 lawful under state law.
  5  9    This bill strikes and rewrites this Code section to provide
  5 10 that the regulation of firearms, firearm accessories, and
  5 11 ammunition is declared to be the exclusive domain of the state.
  5 12 The bill provides that an ordinance, measure, enactment, rule,
  5 13 resolution, motion, or policy of a political subdivision of

  5 17 is void.
  5 18    The bill shall not be construed to prevent a law enforcement

  5 34 otherwise lawful under the laws of this state, which is in

  6 22 policy adopted or enforced in violation of the bill may file

  5  8 lawful under state law.
  5  9    This bill strikes and rewrites this Code section to provide
  5 10 that the regulation of firearms, firearm accessories, and
  5 11 ammunition is declared to be the exclusive domain of the state.
  5 12 The bill provides that an ordinance, measure, enactment, rule,
  5 13 resolution, motion, or policy of a political subdivision of

  5 17 is void.

  5 30 businesses along with other businesses, provided that an
  5 31 ordinance which is designed or enforced to effectively restrict
  5 32 or prohibit the sale, purchase, transfer, manufacture, or
  5 33 display of firearms, firearm accessories, or ammunition
  5 34 otherwise lawful under the laws of this state, which is in
  5 35 conflict with the bill, is void; a political subdivision
  6  1 from adopting or enforcing rules of operation and use for a
  6  2 shooting range owned or operated by the political subdivision;

  6  8 enactment, rule, resolution, motion, or policy void and issue
  6  9 a permanent injunction against the political subdivision

  6 13 advice of counsel. The court shall assess a civil penalty of
  6 14 up to $5,000 against the elected or appointed local government
  6 15 official or employee or agent of an administrative agency
  6 16 under whose jurisdiction the violation occurred if a violation
  6 17 was knowing and willful. In addition, knowing and willful
  6 18 violations by a person acting in an official capacity shall be

  6 22 policy adopted or enforced in violation of the bill may file

  5 12 The bill provides that an ordinance, measure, enactment, rule,
  5 13 resolution, motion, or policy of a political subdivision of

  4 35                           EXPLANATION
  5  1 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  5  2 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  5  3    Current Code section 724.28 prohibits a political
  5  4 subdivision of the state from enacting an ordinance
  5  5 restricting the ownership, possession, legal transfer, lawful
  5  6 transportation, registration, or licensing of firearms when the
  5  7 ownership, possession, transfer, or transportation is otherwise
  5  8 lawful under state law.
  5  9    This bill strikes and rewrites this Code section to provide
  5 10 that the regulation of firearms, firearm accessories, and
  5 11 ammunition is declared to be the exclusive domain of the state.
  5 12 The bill provides that an ordinance, measure, enactment, rule,
  5 13 resolution, motion, or policy of a political subdivision of
  5 14 this state, or an official action of an employee or agent of
  5 15 such political subdivision, including through any legislative,
  5 16 police power, or proprietary capacity, in violation of the bill
  5 17 is void.
  5 18    The bill shall not be construed to prevent a law enforcement
  5 19 agency of a political subdivision from adopting and enforcing
  5 20 rules pertaining to firearms, firearm accessories, or
  5 21 ammunition issued to or used by peace officers in the course
  5 22 of their official duties; an employer from regulating or
  5 23 prohibiting an employee from carrying or possessing firearms,
  5 24 firearm accessories, or ammunition during and in the course
  5 25 of the employee's official duties; a court or administrative
  5 26 law judge from hearing and resolving a case or controversy or
  5 27 issuing an opinion or order on a matter within the court's or
  5 28 the judge's jurisdiction; enacting or enforcing a generally
  5 29 applicable zoning or business ordinance that includes firearms
  5 30 businesses along with other businesses, provided that an
  5 31 ordinance which is designed or enforced to effectively restrict
  5 32 or prohibit the sale, purchase, transfer, manufacture, or
  5 33 display of firearms, firearm accessories, or ammunition
  5 34 otherwise lawful under the laws of this state, which is in
  5 35 conflict with the bill, is void; a political subdivision
  6  1 from adopting or enforcing rules of operation and use for a
  6  2 shooting range owned or operated by the political subdivision;
  6  3 and a political subdivision that sponsors or conducts any
  6  4 firearm=related competition or educational or cultural program
  6  5 from adopting rules of attendance for such a program.
  6  6    The bill provides that if a political subdivision violates
  6  7 the bill, the court shall declare the ordinance, measure,
  6  8 enactment, rule, resolution, motion, or policy void and issue
  6  9 a permanent injunction against the political subdivision
  6 10 prohibiting enforcement of such ordinance, measure, enactment,
  6 11 rule, resolution, motion, or policy.  It is not a defense that
  6 12 the political subdivision was acting in good faith or upon the
  6 13 advice of counsel. The court shall assess a civil penalty of
  6 14 up to $5,000 against the elected or appointed local government
  6 15 official or employee or agent of an administrative agency
  6 16 under whose jurisdiction the violation occurred if a violation
  6 17 was knowing and willful. In addition, knowing and willful
  6 18 violations by a person acting in an official capacity shall be
  6 19 cause for termination or removal.

  6 22 policy adopted or enforced in violation of the bill may file
  6 23 suit in the appropriate court for declarative and injunctive
  6 24 relief and for damages and may, if successful, be awarded

  4 35                           EXPLANATION
  5  1 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  5  2 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  5  3    Current Code section 724.28 prohibits a political
  5  4 subdivision of the state from enacting an ordinance
  5  5 restricting the ownership, possession, legal transfer, lawful
  5  6 transportation, registration, or licensing of firearms when the
  5  7 ownership, possession, transfer, or transportation is otherwise
  5  8 lawful under state law.
  5  9    This bill strikes and rewrites this Code section to provide
  5 10 that the regulation of firearms, firearm accessories, and
  5 11 ammunition is declared to be the exclusive domain of the state.
  5 12 The bill provides that an ordinance, measure, enactment, rule,
  5 13 resolution, motion, or policy of a political subdivision of
  5 14 this state, or an official action of an employee or agent of
  5 15 such political subdivision, including through any legislative,
  5 16 police power, or proprietary capacity, in violation of the bill
  5 17 is void.
  5 18    The bill shall not be construed to prevent a law enforcement
  5 19 agency of a political subdivision from adopting and enforcing
  5 20 rules pertaining to firearms, firearm accessories, or
  5 21 ammunition issued to or used by peace officers in the course
  5 22 of their official duties; an employer from regulating or
  5 23 prohibiting an employee from carrying or possessing firearms,
  5 24 firearm accessories, or ammunition during and in the course
  5 25 of the employee's official duties; a court or administrative
  5 26 law judge from hearing and resolving a case or controversy or
  5 27 issuing an opinion or order on a matter within the court's or
  5 28 the judge's jurisdiction; enacting or enforcing a generally
  5 29 applicable zoning or business ordinance that includes firearms
  5 30 businesses along with other businesses, provided that an
  5 31 ordinance which is designed or enforced to effectively restrict
  5 32 or prohibit the sale, purchase, transfer, manufacture, or
  5 33 display of firearms, firearm accessories, or ammunition
  5 34 otherwise lawful under the laws of this state, which is in
  5 35 conflict with the bill, is void; a political subdivision
  6  1 from adopting or enforcing rules of operation and use for a
  6  2 shooting range owned or operated by the political subdivision;
  6  3 and a political subdivision that sponsors or conducts any
  6  4 firearm=related competition or educational or cultural program
  6  5 from adopting rules of attendance for such a program.
  6  6    The bill provides that if a political subdivision violates
  6  7 the bill, the court shall declare the ordinance, measure,
  6  8 enactment, rule, resolution, motion, or policy void and issue
  6  9 a permanent injunction against the political subdivision
  6 10 prohibiting enforcement of such ordinance, measure, enactment,
  6 11 rule, resolution, motion, or policy.  It is not a defense that
  6 12 the political subdivision was acting in good faith or upon the
  6 13 advice of counsel. The court shall assess a civil penalty of
  6 14 up to $5,000 against the elected or appointed local government
  6 15 official or employee or agent of an administrative agency
  6 16 under whose jurisdiction the violation occurred if a violation
  6 17 was knowing and willful. In addition, knowing and willful
  6 18 violations by a person acting in an official capacity shall be
  6 19 cause for termination or removal.
  6 20    The bill provides that a person adversely affected by an
  6 21 ordinance, measure, enactment, rule, resolution, motion, or
  6 22 policy adopted or enforced in violation of the bill may file
  6 23 suit in the appropriate court for declarative and injunctive
  6 24 relief and for damages and may, if successful, be awarded
  6 25 reasonable attorney fees and costs and the greater of actual
  6 26 damages or liquidated damages equal to the amount of three
  6 27 times the attorney fees awarded.
  6 28    The bill applies to any ordinance, measure, enactment,
  6 29 rule, resolution, motion, or policy adopted by a political
  6 30 subdivision of this state or to official actions taken by any
  6 31 employee or agent of such political subdivision, on or after

  4 35                           EXPLANATION
  5  1 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  5  2 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  5  3    Current Code section 724.28 prohibits a political
  5  4 subdivision of the state from enacting an ordinance
  5  5 restricting the ownership, possession, legal transfer, lawful
  5  6 transportation, registration, or licensing of firearms when the
  5  7 ownership, possession, transfer, or transportation is otherwise
  5  8 lawful under state law.
  5  9    This bill strikes and rewrites this Code section to provide
  5 10 that the regulation of firearms, firearm accessories, and
  5 11 ammunition is declared to be the exclusive domain of the state.
  5 12 The bill provides that an ordinance, measure, enactment, rule,
  5 13 resolution, motion, or policy of a political subdivision of
  5 14 this state, or an official action of an employee or agent of
  5 15 such political subdivision, including through any legislative,
  5 16 police power, or proprietary capacity, in violation of the bill
  5 17 is void.
  5 18    The bill shall not be construed to prevent a law enforcement
  5 19 agency of a political subdivision from adopting and enforcing
  5 20 rules pertaining to firearms, firearm accessories, or
  5 21 ammunition issued to or used by peace officers in the course
  5 22 of their official duties; an employer from regulating or
  5 23 prohibiting an employee from carrying or possessing firearms,
  5 24 firearm accessories, or ammunition during and in the course
  5 25 of the employee's official duties; a court or administrative
  5 26 law judge from hearing and resolving a case or controversy or
  5 27 issuing an opinion or order on a matter within the court's or
  5 28 the judge's jurisdiction; enacting or enforcing a generally
  5 29 applicable zoning or business ordinance that includes firearms
  5 30 businesses along with other businesses, provided that an
  5 31 ordinance which is designed or enforced to effectively restrict
  5 32 or prohibit the sale, purchase, transfer, manufacture, or
  5 33 display of firearms, firearm accessories, or ammunition
  5 34 otherwise lawful under the laws of this state, which is in
  5 35 conflict with the bill, is void; a political subdivision
  6  1 from adopting or enforcing rules of operation and use for a
  6  2 shooting range owned or operated by the political subdivision;
  6  3 and a political subdivision that sponsors or conducts any
  6  4 firearm=related competition or educational or cultural program
  6  5 from adopting rules of attendance for such a program.
  6  6    The bill provides that if a political subdivision violates
  6  7 the bill, the court shall declare the ordinance, measure,
  6  8 enactment, rule, resolution, motion, or policy void and issue
  6  9 a permanent injunction against the political subdivision
  6 10 prohibiting enforcement of such ordinance, measure, enactment,
  6 11 rule, resolution, motion, or policy.  It is not a defense that
  6 12 the political subdivision was acting in good faith or upon the
  6 13 advice of counsel. The court shall assess a civil penalty of
  6 14 up to $5,000 against the elected or appointed local government
  6 15 official or employee or agent of an administrative agency
  6 16 under whose jurisdiction the violation occurred if a violation
  6 17 was knowing and willful. In addition, knowing and willful
  6 18 violations by a person acting in an official capacity shall be
  6 19 cause for termination or removal.
  6 20    The bill provides that a person adversely affected by an
  6 21 ordinance, measure, enactment, rule, resolution, motion, or
  6 22 policy adopted or enforced in violation of the bill may file
  6 23 suit in the appropriate court for declarative and injunctive
  6 24 relief and for damages and may, if successful, be awarded
  6 25 reasonable attorney fees and costs and the greater of actual
  6 26 damages or liquidated damages equal to the amount of three
  6 27 times the attorney fees awarded.
  6 28    The bill applies to any ordinance, measure, enactment,
  6 29 rule, resolution, motion, or policy adopted by a political
  6 30 subdivision of this state or to official actions taken by any
  6 31 employee or agent of such political subdivision, on or after
  6 32 the effective date of the bill. The penalties and remedies of
  6 33 the bill shall first be imposed 90 days after the effective
  6 34 date of the bill.

  5 12 The bill provides that an ordinance, measure, enactment, rule,

  5  1 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  5  2 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  5  3    Current Code section 724.28 prohibits a political
  5  4 subdivision of the state from enacting an ordinance
  5  5 restricting the ownership, possession, legal transfer, lawful
  5  6 transportation, registration, or licensing of firearms when the
  5  7 ownership, possession, transfer, or transportation is otherwise
  5  8 lawful under state law.
  5  9    This bill strikes and rewrites this Code section to provide
  5 10 that the regulation of firearms, firearm accessories, and
  5 11 ammunition is declared to be the exclusive domain of the state.
  5 12 The bill provides that an ordinance, measure, enactment, rule,
  5 13 resolution, motion, or policy of a political subdivision of
  5 14 this state, or an official action of an employee or agent of
  5 15 such political subdivision, including through any legislative,
  5 16 police power, or proprietary capacity, in violation of the bill
  5 17 is void.
  5 18    The bill shall not be construed to prevent a law enforcement
  5 19 agency of a political subdivision from adopting and enforcing
  5 20 rules pertaining to firearms, firearm accessories, or
  5 21 ammunition issued to or used by peace officers in the course
  5 22 of their official duties; an employer from regulating or
  5 23 prohibiting an employee from carrying or possessing firearms,
  5 24 firearm accessories, or ammunition during and in the course
  5 25 of the employee's official duties; a court or administrative
  5 26 law judge from hearing and resolving a case or controversy or
  5 27 issuing an opinion or order on a matter within the court's or
  5 28 the judge's jurisdiction; enacting or enforcing a generally
  5 29 applicable zoning or business ordinance that includes firearms
  5 30 businesses along with other businesses, provided that an
  5 31 ordinance which is designed or enforced to effectively restrict
  5 32 or prohibit the sale, purchase, transfer, manufacture, or
  5 33 display of firearms, firearm accessories, or ammunition
  5 34 otherwise lawful under the laws of this state, which is in
  5 35 conflict with the bill, is void; a political subdivision
  6  1 from adopting or enforcing rules of operation and use for a
  6  2 shooting range owned or operated by the political subdivision;
  6  3 and a political subdivision that sponsors or conducts any
  6  4 firearm=related competition or educational or cultural program
  6  5 from adopting rules of attendance for such a program.
  6  6    The bill provides that if a political subdivision violates
  6  7 the bill, the court shall declare the ordinance, measure,
  6  8 enactment, rule, resolution, motion, or policy void and issue
  6  9 a permanent injunction against the political subdivision
  6 10 prohibiting enforcement of such ordinance, measure, enactment,
  6 11 rule, resolution, motion, or policy.  It is not a defense that
  6 12 the political subdivision was acting in good faith or upon the
  6 13 advice of counsel. The court shall assess a civil penalty of
  6 14 up to $5,000 against the elected or appointed local government
  6 15 official or employee or agent of an administrative agency
  6 16 under whose jurisdiction the violation occurred if a violation
  6 17 was knowing and willful. In addition, knowing and willful
  6 18 violations by a person acting in an official capacity shall be
  6 19 cause for termination or removal.
  6 20    The bill provides that a person adversely affected by an
  6 21 ordinance, measure, enactment, rule, resolution, motion, or
  6 22 policy adopted or enforced in violation of the bill may file
  6 23 suit in the appropriate court for declarative and injunctive
  6 24 relief and for damages and may, if successful, be awarded

  5  3    Current Code section 724.28 prohibits a political
  5  4 subdivision of the state from enacting an ordinance
  5  5 restricting the ownership, possession, legal transfer, lawful
  5  6 transportation, registration, or licensing of firearms when the
  5  7 ownership, possession, transfer, or transportation is otherwise
  5  8 lawful under state law.
  5  9    This bill strikes and rewrites this Code section to provide
  5 10 that the regulation of firearms, firearm accessories, and
  5 11 ammunition is declared to be the exclusive domain of the state.
  5 12 The bill provides that an ordinance, measure, enactment, rule,
  5 13 resolution, motion, or policy of a political subdivision of
  5 14 this state, or an official action of an employee or agent of
  5 15 such political subdivision, including through any legislative,
  5 16 police power, or proprietary capacity, in violation of the bill
  5 17 is void.
  5 18    The bill shall not be construed to prevent a law enforcement
  5 19 agency of a political subdivision from adopting and enforcing
  5 20 rules pertaining to firearms, firearm accessories, or
  5 21 ammunition issued to or used by peace officers in the course
  5 22 of their official duties; an employer from regulating or
  5 23 prohibiting an employee from carrying or possessing firearms,
  5 24 firearm accessories, or ammunition during and in the course
  5 25 of the employee's official duties; a court or administrative
  5 26 law judge from hearing and resolving a case or controversy or
  5 27 issuing an opinion or order on a matter within the court's or
  5 28 the judge's jurisdiction; enacting or enforcing a generally
  5 29 applicable zoning or business ordinance that includes firearms
  5 30 businesses along with other businesses, provided that an
  5 31 ordinance which is designed or enforced to effectively restrict
  5 32 or prohibit the sale, purchase, transfer, manufacture, or
  5 33 display of firearms, firearm accessories, or ammunition
  5 34 otherwise lawful under the laws of this state, which is in
  5 35 conflict with the bill, is void; a political subdivision
  6  1 from adopting or enforcing rules of operation and use for a
  6  2 shooting range owned or operated by the political subdivision;
  6  3 and a political subdivision that sponsors or conducts any
  6  4 firearm=related competition or educational or cultural program
  6  5 from adopting rules of attendance for such a program.
  6  6    The bill provides that if a political subdivision violates
  6  7 the bill, the court shall declare the ordinance, measure,
  6  8 enactment, rule, resolution, motion, or policy void and issue
  6  9 a permanent injunction against the political subdivision
  6 10 prohibiting enforcement of such ordinance, measure, enactment,
  6 11 rule, resolution, motion, or policy.  It is not a defense that
  6 12 the political subdivision was acting in good faith or upon the
  6 13 advice of counsel. The court shall assess a civil penalty of
  6 14 up to $5,000 against the elected or appointed local government
  6 15 official or employee or agent of an administrative agency
  6 16 under whose jurisdiction the violation occurred if a violation
  6 17 was knowing and willful. In addition, knowing and willful
  6 18 violations by a person acting in an official capacity shall be
  6 19 cause for termination or removal.
  6 20    The bill provides that a person adversely affected by an
  6 21 ordinance, measure, enactment, rule, resolution, motion, or
  6 22 policy adopted or enforced in violation of the bill may file
  6 23 suit in the appropriate court for declarative and injunctive
  6 24 relief and for damages and may, if successful, be awarded
  6 25 reasonable attorney fees and costs and the greater of actual
  6 26 damages or liquidated damages equal to the amount of three
  6 27 times the attorney fees awarded.
  6 28    The bill applies to any ordinance, measure, enactment,
  6 29 rule, resolution, motion, or policy adopted by a political
  6 30 subdivision of this state or to official actions taken by any
  6 31 employee or agent of such political subdivision, on or after

  4 35                           EXPLANATION
  5  1 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  5  2 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  5  3    Current Code section 724.28 prohibits a political
  5  4 subdivision of the state from enacting an ordinance
  5  5 restricting the ownership, possession, legal transfer, lawful
  5  6 transportation, registration, or licensing of firearms when the
  5  7 ownership, possession, transfer, or transportation is otherwise
  5  8 lawful under state law.
  5  9    This bill strikes and rewrites this Code section to provide
  5 10 that the regulation of firearms, firearm accessories, and
  5 11 ammunition is declared to be the exclusive domain of the state.
  5 12 The bill provides that an ordinance, measure, enactment, rule,
  5 13 resolution, motion, or policy of a political subdivision of
  5 14 this state, or an official action of an employee or agent of
  5 15 such political subdivision, including through any legislative,
  5 16 police power, or proprietary capacity, in violation of the bill
  5 17 is void.
  5 18    The bill shall not be construed to prevent a law enforcement
  5 19 agency of a political subdivision from adopting and enforcing
  5 20 rules pertaining to firearms, firearm accessories, or
  5 21 ammunition issued to or used by peace officers in the course
  5 22 of their official duties; an employer from regulating or
  5 23 prohibiting an employee from carrying or possessing firearms,
  5 24 firearm accessories, or ammunition during and in the course
  5 25 of the employee's official duties; a court or administrative
  5 26 law judge from hearing and resolving a case or controversy or
  5 27 issuing an opinion or order on a matter within the court's or
  5 28 the judge's jurisdiction; enacting or enforcing a generally
  5 29 applicable zoning or business ordinance that includes firearms
  5 30 businesses along with other businesses, provided that an
  5 31 ordinance which is designed or enforced to effectively restrict
  5 32 or prohibit the sale, purchase, transfer, manufacture, or
  5 33 display of firearms, firearm accessories, or ammunition
  5 34 otherwise lawful under the laws of this state, which is in
  5 35 conflict with the bill, is void; a political subdivision
  6  1 from adopting or enforcing rules of operation and use for a
  6  2 shooting range owned or operated by the political subdivision;
  6  3 and a political subdivision that sponsors or conducts any
  6  4 firearm=related competition or educational or cultural program
  6  5 from adopting rules of attendance for such a program.
  6  6    The bill provides that if a political subdivision violates
  6  7 the bill, the court shall declare the ordinance, measure,
  6  8 enactment, rule, resolution, motion, or policy void and issue
  6  9 a permanent injunction against the political subdivision
  6 10 prohibiting enforcement of such ordinance, measure, enactment,
  6 11 rule, resolution, motion, or policy.  It is not a defense that
  6 12 the political subdivision was acting in good faith or upon the
  6 13 advice of counsel. The court shall assess a civil penalty of
  6 14 up to $5,000 against the elected or appointed local government
  6 15 official or employee or agent of an administrative agency
  6 16 under whose jurisdiction the violation occurred if a violation
  6 17 was knowing and willful. In addition, knowing and willful
  6 18 violations by a person acting in an official capacity shall be
  6 19 cause for termination or removal.
  6 20    The bill provides that a person adversely affected by an
  6 21 ordinance, measure, enactment, rule, resolution, motion, or
  6 22 policy adopted or enforced in violation of the bill may file
  6 23 suit in the appropriate court for declarative and injunctive
  6 24 relief and for damages and may, if successful, be awarded
  6 25 reasonable attorney fees and costs and the greater of actual
  6 26 damages or liquidated damages equal to the amount of three
  6 27 times the attorney fees awarded.

  4 35                           EXPLANATION
  5  1 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  5  2 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  5  3    Current Code section 724.28 prohibits a political
  5  4 subdivision of the state from enacting an ordinance
  5  5 restricting the ownership, possession, legal transfer, lawful
  5  6 transportation, registration, or licensing of firearms when the
  5  7 ownership, possession, transfer, or transportation is otherwise
  5  8 lawful under state law.
  5  9    This bill strikes and rewrites this Code section to provide
  5 10 that the regulation of firearms, firearm accessories, and
  5 11 ammunition is declared to be the exclusive domain of the state.
  5 12 The bill provides that an ordinance, measure, enactment, rule,
  5 13 resolution, motion, or policy of a political subdivision of
  5 14 this state, or an official action of an employee or agent of
  5 15 such political subdivision, including through any legislative,
  5 16 police power, or proprietary capacity, in violation of the bill
  5 17 is void.
  5 18    The bill shall not be construed to prevent a law enforcement
  5 19 agency of a political subdivision from adopting and enforcing
  5 20 rules pertaining to firearms, firearm accessories, or
  5 21 ammunition issued to or used by peace officers in the course
  5 22 of their official duties; an employer from regulating or
  5 23 prohibiting an employee from carrying or possessing firearms,
  5 24 firearm accessories, or ammunition during and in the course
  5 25 of the employee's official duties; a court or administrative
  5 26 law judge from hearing and resolving a case or controversy or
  5 27 issuing an opinion or order on a matter within the court's or
  5 28 the judge's jurisdiction; enacting or enforcing a generally
  5 29 applicable zoning or business ordinance that includes firearms
  5 30 businesses along with other businesses, provided that an
  5 31 ordinance which is designed or enforced to effectively restrict
  5 32 or prohibit the sale, purchase, transfer, manufacture, or
  5 33 display of firearms, firearm accessories, or ammunition
  5 34 otherwise lawful under the laws of this state, which is in
  5 35 conflict with the bill, is void; a political subdivision
  6  1 from adopting or enforcing rules of operation and use for a
  6  2 shooting range owned or operated by the political subdivision;
  6  3 and a political subdivision that sponsors or conducts any
  6  4 firearm=related competition or educational or cultural program
  6  5 from adopting rules of attendance for such a program.
  6  6    The bill provides that if a political subdivision violates
  6  7 the bill, the court shall declare the ordinance, measure,
  6  8 enactment, rule, resolution, motion, or policy void and issue
  6  9 a permanent injunction against the political subdivision
  6 10 prohibiting enforcement of such ordinance, measure, enactment,
  6 11 rule, resolution, motion, or policy.  It is not a defense that
  6 12 the political subdivision was acting in good faith or upon the
  6 13 advice of counsel. The court shall assess a civil penalty of
  6 14 up to $5,000 against the elected or appointed local government
  6 15 official or employee or agent of an administrative agency
  6 16 under whose jurisdiction the violation occurred if a violation
  6 17 was knowing and willful. In addition, knowing and willful
  6 18 violations by a person acting in an official capacity shall be
  6 19 cause for termination or removal.
  6 20    The bill provides that a person adversely affected by an
  6 21 ordinance, measure, enactment, rule, resolution, motion, or
  6 22 policy adopted or enforced in violation of the bill may file
  6 23 suit in the appropriate court for declarative and injunctive
  6 24 relief and for damages and may, if successful, be awarded
  6 25 reasonable attorney fees and costs and the greater of actual
  6 26 damages or liquidated damages equal to the amount of three
  6 27 times the attorney fees awarded.
  6 28    The bill applies to any ordinance, measure, enactment,
  6 29 rule, resolution, motion, or policy adopted by a political
  6 30 subdivision of this state or to official actions taken by any
  6 31 employee or agent of such political subdivision, on or after

  5 17 is void.
  5 18    The bill shall not be construed to prevent a law enforcement
