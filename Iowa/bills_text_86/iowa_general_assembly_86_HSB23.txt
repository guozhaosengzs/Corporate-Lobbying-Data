EXPLANATION
18


The
inclusion
of
this
explanation
does
not
constitute
agreement
with
19


the
explanation’s
substance
by
the
members
of
the
general
assembly.
20


Current
law
permits
an
employer
to
require
an
employee,
as
21


a
condition
of
employment,
to
participate
in
direct
deposit
22


of
the
employee’s
wages
in
a
financial
institution
of
the
23


employee’s
choice
unless
the
associated
costs
would
reduce
the
24


employee’s
wage
below
the
minimum
wage,
the
employee
would
25


incur
fees
as
a
result,
or
an
applicable
collective
bargaining
26


agreement
prohibits
requiring
direct
deposit
of
wages.
The
27


direct
deposit
requirement
only
applies
to
employees
hired
on
28


or
after
July
1,
2005.
29


This
bill
strikes
the
limitation
to
employees
hired
on
or
30


after
July
1,
2005,
so
that
the
permission
will
apply
to
all
31


employees.
