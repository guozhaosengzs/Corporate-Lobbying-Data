  5  2                           EXPLANATION
  5  3 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  5  4 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  5  5    This bill relates to wage discrimination under Iowa Code
  5  6 chapter 216, the Iowa civil rights Act of 1965, and establishes
  5  7 an equal pay task force.
  5  8    WAGE DISCRIMINATION IN EMPLOYMENT.  The bill establishes
  5  9 additional unfair or discriminatory practices relating to wages
  5 10 under Code section 216.6A.  Penalty and remedial provisions
  5 11 for discriminatory employment practices, including penalties
  5 12 specific to wage discrimination, are applicable under Code
  5 13 chapter 216 to violations of these requirements.
  5 14    The bill prohibits an employer from requiring that an
  5 15 employee refrain from disclosing, discussing, or sharing
  5 16 information about the amount of the employee's wages, benefits,
  5 17 or other compensation or from inquiring, discussing, or sharing
  5 18 information about any other employee's wages, benefits, or
  5 19 other compensation as a condition of employment. The bill
  5 20 prohibits an employer from requiring that an employee sign a
  5 21 waiver or other document that requires an employee to refrain
  5 22 from engaging in any of those activities as a condition of
  5 23 employment. The bill prohibits an employer from discriminating
  5 24 or retaliating against an employee for engaging in any of the
  5 25 activities.
  5 26    The bill prohibits an employer from seeking salary history
  5 27 information from a potential employee as a condition of a job
  5 28 interview or employment. This provision shall not be construed
  5 29 to prohibit a prospective employer from asking a prospective
  5 30 employee what salary level the prospective employee would
  5 31 require in order to accept a job.
  5 32    The bill prohibits an employer from releasing the salary
  5 33 history of any current or former employee to any prospective
  5 34 employer in response to a request as part of an interview or
  5 35 hiring process without written authorization from such current
  6  1 or former employee.
  6  2    The bill prohibits an employer from publishing, listing, or
  6  3 posting within the employer's organization, with any employment
  6  4 agency, job=listing service, or internet site, or in any other
  6  5 public manner, an advertisement to recruit candidates for
  6  6 hire or independent contractors to fill a position within the
  6  7 employer's organization without including the minimum rate of
  6  8 pay of the position. The rate of pay shall include overtime
  6  9 and allowances, if any, claimed as part of the minimum wage,
  6 10 including but not limited to tipped wages. The bill prohibits
  6 11 an employer from paying a newly hired employee at less than the
  6 12 rate of pay advertised for the employee's position.
  6 13    Under current law, an employer has an affirmative defense
  6 14 to a claim under Code section 216.6A if a pay differential
  6 15 is based on any other factor other than prohibited wage
  6 16 discrimination. The bill provides that an employer has an
  6 17 affirmative defense to a claim under Code section 216.6A if a
  6 18 pay differential is based on any other bona fide factor other
  6 19 than prohibited discrimination, including but not limited
  6 20 to a bona fide factor relating to education, training, or
  6 21 experience. However, this defense shall only apply if the
  6 22 employer demonstrates that the factor is not based on or
  6 23 derived from prohibited wage discrimination, is job related
  6 24 with respect to the position in question, and is consistent
  6 25 with a business necessity. The bill defines "business
  6 26 necessity" as an overriding legitimate business purpose
  6 27 such that the factor relied upon effectively fulfills the
  6 28 business purpose it is supposed to serve. This affirmative
  6 29 defense shall not apply if the employee demonstrates that an
  6 30 alternative business practice exists that would serve the same
  6 31 business purpose without producing the wage differential.
  6 32    The bill provides that affirmative defenses to a claim under
  6 33 Code section 216.6A are not applicable unless one or more of
  6 34 the defenses account for the entire pay differential that is
  6 35 the subject of the claim.
  7  1 EQUAL PAY TASK FORCE.  The bill creates an equal pay task
  7  2 force to study the extent of discriminatory wage disparities
  7  3 in the public and private sectors, the factors that cause
  7  4 such disparities, the consequences of such disparities, and
  7  5 actions likely to lead to the elimination and prevention of
  7  6 such disparities.
  7  7    The bill establishes the membership of the task force,
  7  8 including ex officio, nonvoting legislative members. The civil
  7  9 rights commission shall provide staffing services for the task
  7 10 force.
  7 11    The task force shall submit a report regarding its findings
  7 12 and its recommendations regarding potential actions for the
  7 13 elimination and prevention of discriminatory wage disparities
  7 14 to the governor and the general assembly no later than December
  7 15 22, 2017.

  5  2                           EXPLANATION
  5  3 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  5  4 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  5  5    This bill relates to wage discrimination under Iowa Code
  5  6 chapter 216, the Iowa civil rights Act of 1965, and establishes
  5  7 an equal pay task force.
  5  8    WAGE DISCRIMINATION IN EMPLOYMENT.  The bill establishes
  5  9 additional unfair or discriminatory practices relating to wages
  5 10 under Code section 216.6A.  Penalty and remedial provisions
  5 11 for discriminatory employment practices, including penalties
  5 12 specific to wage discrimination, are applicable under Code
  5 13 chapter 216 to violations of these requirements.
  5 14    The bill prohibits an employer from requiring that an
  5 15 employee refrain from disclosing, discussing, or sharing
  5 16 information about the amount of the employee's wages, benefits,
  5 17 or other compensation or from inquiring, discussing, or sharing
  5 18 information about any other employee's wages, benefits, or
  5 19 other compensation as a condition of employment. The bill
  5 20 prohibits an employer from requiring that an employee sign a
  5 21 waiver or other document that requires an employee to refrain
  5 22 from engaging in any of those activities as a condition of
  5 23 employment. The bill prohibits an employer from discriminating
  5 24 or retaliating against an employee for engaging in any of the
  5 25 activities.
  5 26    The bill prohibits an employer from seeking salary history
  5 27 information from a potential employee as a condition of a job
  5 28 interview or employment. This provision shall not be construed
  5 29 to prohibit a prospective employer from asking a prospective
  5 30 employee what salary level the prospective employee would
  5 31 require in order to accept a job.
  5 32    The bill prohibits an employer from releasing the salary
  5 33 history of any current or former employee to any prospective
  5 34 employer in response to a request as part of an interview or
  5 35 hiring process without written authorization from such current
  6  1 or former employee.
  6  2    The bill prohibits an employer from publishing, listing, or
  6  3 posting within the employer's organization, with any employment
  6  4 agency, job=listing service, or internet site, or in any other
  6  5 public manner, an advertisement to recruit candidates for
  6  6 hire or independent contractors to fill a position within the
  6  7 employer's organization without including the minimum rate of
  6  8 pay of the position. The rate of pay shall include overtime
  6  9 and allowances, if any, claimed as part of the minimum wage,
  6 10 including but not limited to tipped wages. The bill prohibits
  6 11 an employer from paying a newly hired employee at less than the
  6 12 rate of pay advertised for the employee's position.
  6 13    Under current law, an employer has an affirmative defense
  6 14 to a claim under Code section 216.6A if a pay differential
  6 15 is based on any other factor other than prohibited wage
  6 16 discrimination. The bill provides that an employer has an
  6 17 affirmative defense to a claim under Code section 216.6A if a
  6 18 pay differential is based on any other bona fide factor other
  6 19 than prohibited discrimination, including but not limited
  6 20 to a bona fide factor relating to education, training, or
  6 21 experience. However, this defense shall only apply if the
  6 22 employer demonstrates that the factor is not based on or
  6 23 derived from prohibited wage discrimination, is job related
  6 24 with respect to the position in question, and is consistent
  6 25 with a business necessity. The bill defines "business

  6 29 defense shall not apply if the employee demonstrates that an

  6 32    The bill provides that affirmative defenses to a claim under

  5 34 employer in response to a request as part of an interview or
  5 35 hiring process without written authorization from such current
  6  1 or former employee.
  6  2    The bill prohibits an employer from publishing, listing, or
  6  3 posting within the employer's organization, with any employment
  6  4 agency, job=listing service, or internet site, or in any other
  6  5 public manner, an advertisement to recruit candidates for
  6  6 hire or independent contractors to fill a position within the
  6  7 employer's organization without including the minimum rate of
  6  8 pay of the position. The rate of pay shall include overtime
  6  9 and allowances, if any, claimed as part of the minimum wage,
  6 10 including but not limited to tipped wages. The bill prohibits
  6 11 an employer from paying a newly hired employee at less than the
  6 12 rate of pay advertised for the employee's position.
  6 13    Under current law, an employer has an affirmative defense
  6 14 to a claim under Code section 216.6A if a pay differential
  6 15 is based on any other factor other than prohibited wage
  6 16 discrimination. The bill provides that an employer has an
  6 17 affirmative defense to a claim under Code section 216.6A if a
  6 18 pay differential is based on any other bona fide factor other
  6 19 than prohibited discrimination, including but not limited
  6 20 to a bona fide factor relating to education, training, or
  6 21 experience. However, this defense shall only apply if the
  6 22 employer demonstrates that the factor is not based on or
  6 23 derived from prohibited wage discrimination, is job related
  6 24 with respect to the position in question, and is consistent
  6 25 with a business necessity. The bill defines "business
  6 26 necessity" as an overriding legitimate business purpose
  6 27 such that the factor relied upon effectively fulfills the
  6 28 business purpose it is supposed to serve. This affirmative
  6 29 defense shall not apply if the employee demonstrates that an
  6 30 alternative business practice exists that would serve the same
  6 31 business purpose without producing the wage differential.
  6 32    The bill provides that affirmative defenses to a claim under
  6 33 Code section 216.6A are not applicable unless one or more of
  6 34 the defenses account for the entire pay differential that is
  6 35 the subject of the claim.
  7  1 EQUAL PAY TASK FORCE.  The bill creates an equal pay task
  7  2 force to study the extent of discriminatory wage disparities
  7  3 in the public and private sectors, the factors that cause
  7  4 such disparities, the consequences of such disparities, and
  7  5 actions likely to lead to the elimination and prevention of
  7  6 such disparities.
  7  7    The bill establishes the membership of the task force,
  7  8 including ex officio, nonvoting legislative members. The civil
  7  9 rights commission shall provide staffing services for the task
  7 10 force.

  7 12 and its recommendations regarding potential actions for the
  7 13 elimination and prevention of discriminatory wage disparities

  5  2                           EXPLANATION
  5  3 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  5  4 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  5  5    This bill relates to wage discrimination under Iowa Code
  5  6 chapter 216, the Iowa civil rights Act of 1965, and establishes
  5  7 an equal pay task force.
  5  8    WAGE DISCRIMINATION IN EMPLOYMENT.  The bill establishes
  5  9 additional unfair or discriminatory practices relating to wages
  5 10 under Code section 216.6A.  Penalty and remedial provisions
  5 11 for discriminatory employment practices, including penalties
  5 12 specific to wage discrimination, are applicable under Code
  5 13 chapter 216 to violations of these requirements.
  5 14    The bill prohibits an employer from requiring that an
  5 15 employee refrain from disclosing, discussing, or sharing
  5 16 information about the amount of the employee's wages, benefits,
  5 17 or other compensation or from inquiring, discussing, or sharing
  5 18 information about any other employee's wages, benefits, or
  5 19 other compensation as a condition of employment. The bill
  5 20 prohibits an employer from requiring that an employee sign a
  5 21 waiver or other document that requires an employee to refrain
  5 22 from engaging in any of those activities as a condition of
  5 23 employment. The bill prohibits an employer from discriminating
  5 24 or retaliating against an employee for engaging in any of the
  5 25 activities.
  5 26    The bill prohibits an employer from seeking salary history
  5 27 information from a potential employee as a condition of a job
  5 28 interview or employment. This provision shall not be construed
  5 29 to prohibit a prospective employer from asking a prospective
  5 30 employee what salary level the prospective employee would
  5 31 require in order to accept a job.
  5 32    The bill prohibits an employer from releasing the salary
  5 33 history of any current or former employee to any prospective
  5 34 employer in response to a request as part of an interview or
  5 35 hiring process without written authorization from such current
  6  1 or former employee.
  6  2    The bill prohibits an employer from publishing, listing, or
  6  3 posting within the employer's organization, with any employment
  6  4 agency, job=listing service, or internet site, or in any other
  6  5 public manner, an advertisement to recruit candidates for
  6  6 hire or independent contractors to fill a position within the
  6  7 employer's organization without including the minimum rate of
  6  8 pay of the position. The rate of pay shall include overtime
  6  9 and allowances, if any, claimed as part of the minimum wage,
  6 10 including but not limited to tipped wages. The bill prohibits
  6 11 an employer from paying a newly hired employee at less than the
  6 12 rate of pay advertised for the employee's position.
  6 13    Under current law, an employer has an affirmative defense
  6 14 to a claim under Code section 216.6A if a pay differential
  6 15 is based on any other factor other than prohibited wage
  6 16 discrimination. The bill provides that an employer has an
  6 17 affirmative defense to a claim under Code section 216.6A if a
  6 18 pay differential is based on any other bona fide factor other
  6 19 than prohibited discrimination, including but not limited
  6 20 to a bona fide factor relating to education, training, or
  6 21 experience. However, this defense shall only apply if the
  6 22 employer demonstrates that the factor is not based on or
  6 23 derived from prohibited wage discrimination, is job related
  6 24 with respect to the position in question, and is consistent
  6 25 with a business necessity. The bill defines "business
  6 26 necessity" as an overriding legitimate business purpose
  6 27 such that the factor relied upon effectively fulfills the
  6 28 business purpose it is supposed to serve. This affirmative
  6 29 defense shall not apply if the employee demonstrates that an
  6 30 alternative business practice exists that would serve the same
  6 31 business purpose without producing the wage differential.
  6 32    The bill provides that affirmative defenses to a claim under
  6 33 Code section 216.6A are not applicable unless one or more of
  6 34 the defenses account for the entire pay differential that is

  5 28 interview or employment. This provision shall not be construed
  5 29 to prohibit a prospective employer from asking a prospective
  5 30 employee what salary level the prospective employee would
  5 31 require in order to accept a job.
  5 32    The bill prohibits an employer from releasing the salary
  5 33 history of any current or former employee to any prospective
  5 34 employer in response to a request as part of an interview or
  5 35 hiring process without written authorization from such current
  6  1 or former employee.
  6  2    The bill prohibits an employer from publishing, listing, or
  6  3 posting within the employer's organization, with any employment
  6  4 agency, job=listing service, or internet site, or in any other
  6  5 public manner, an advertisement to recruit candidates for
  6  6 hire or independent contractors to fill a position within the
  6  7 employer's organization without including the minimum rate of
  6  8 pay of the position. The rate of pay shall include overtime
  6  9 and allowances, if any, claimed as part of the minimum wage,
  6 10 including but not limited to tipped wages. The bill prohibits
  6 11 an employer from paying a newly hired employee at less than the
  6 12 rate of pay advertised for the employee's position.
  6 13    Under current law, an employer has an affirmative defense
  6 14 to a claim under Code section 216.6A if a pay differential
  6 15 is based on any other factor other than prohibited wage
  6 16 discrimination. The bill provides that an employer has an
  6 17 affirmative defense to a claim under Code section 216.6A if a
  6 18 pay differential is based on any other bona fide factor other
  6 19 than prohibited discrimination, including but not limited
  6 20 to a bona fide factor relating to education, training, or
  6 21 experience. However, this defense shall only apply if the
  6 22 employer demonstrates that the factor is not based on or
  6 23 derived from prohibited wage discrimination, is job related
  6 24 with respect to the position in question, and is consistent
  6 25 with a business necessity. The bill defines "business
  6 26 necessity" as an overriding legitimate business purpose
  6 27 such that the factor relied upon effectively fulfills the
  6 28 business purpose it is supposed to serve. This affirmative
  6 29 defense shall not apply if the employee demonstrates that an
  6 30 alternative business practice exists that would serve the same
  6 31 business purpose without producing the wage differential.
  6 32    The bill provides that affirmative defenses to a claim under
  6 33 Code section 216.6A are not applicable unless one or more of
  6 34 the defenses account for the entire pay differential that is
  6 35 the subject of the claim.
  7  1 EQUAL PAY TASK FORCE.  The bill creates an equal pay task
  7  2 force to study the extent of discriminatory wage disparities
  7  3 in the public and private sectors, the factors that cause
  7  4 such disparities, the consequences of such disparities, and
  7  5 actions likely to lead to the elimination and prevention of
  7  6 such disparities.
  7  7    The bill establishes the membership of the task force,
  7  8 including ex officio, nonvoting legislative members. The civil
  7  9 rights commission shall provide staffing services for the task
  7 10 force.
  7 11    The task force shall submit a report regarding its findings
  7 12 and its recommendations regarding potential actions for the
  7 13 elimination and prevention of discriminatory wage disparities

  5  3 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  5  4 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  5  5    This bill relates to wage discrimination under Iowa Code
  5  6 chapter 216, the Iowa civil rights Act of 1965, and establishes
  5  7 an equal pay task force.
  5  8    WAGE DISCRIMINATION IN EMPLOYMENT.  The bill establishes

  5 13 chapter 216 to violations of these requirements.
  5 14    The bill prohibits an employer from requiring that an
  5 15 employee refrain from disclosing, discussing, or sharing

  5 17 or other compensation or from inquiring, discussing, or sharing
  5 18 information about any other employee's wages, benefits, or
  5 19 other compensation as a condition of employment. The bill
  5 20 prohibits an employer from requiring that an employee sign a
  5 21 waiver or other document that requires an employee to refrain
  5 22 from engaging in any of those activities as a condition of
  5 23 employment. The bill prohibits an employer from discriminating
  5 24 or retaliating against an employee for engaging in any of the
  5 25 activities.

  5 32    The bill prohibits an employer from releasing the salary
  5 33 history of any current or former employee to any prospective
  5 34 employer in response to a request as part of an interview or
  5 35 hiring process without written authorization from such current
  6  1 or former employee.
  6  2    The bill prohibits an employer from publishing, listing, or
  6  3 posting within the employer's organization, with any employment
  6  4 agency, job=listing service, or internet site, or in any other
  6  5 public manner, an advertisement to recruit candidates for
  6  6 hire or independent contractors to fill a position within the
  6  7 employer's organization without including the minimum rate of
  6  8 pay of the position. The rate of pay shall include overtime
  6  9 and allowances, if any, claimed as part of the minimum wage,
  6 10 including but not limited to tipped wages. The bill prohibits
  6 11 an employer from paying a newly hired employee at less than the
  6 12 rate of pay advertised for the employee's position.
  6 13    Under current law, an employer has an affirmative defense
  6 14 to a claim under Code section 216.6A if a pay differential
  6 15 is based on any other factor other than prohibited wage
  6 16 discrimination. The bill provides that an employer has an
  6 17 affirmative defense to a claim under Code section 216.6A if a
  6 18 pay differential is based on any other bona fide factor other
  6 19 than prohibited discrimination, including but not limited
  6 20 to a bona fide factor relating to education, training, or
  6 21 experience. However, this defense shall only apply if the
  6 22 employer demonstrates that the factor is not based on or
  6 23 derived from prohibited wage discrimination, is job related
  6 24 with respect to the position in question, and is consistent
  6 25 with a business necessity. The bill defines "business
  6 26 necessity" as an overriding legitimate business purpose
  6 27 such that the factor relied upon effectively fulfills the
  6 28 business purpose it is supposed to serve. This affirmative
  6 29 defense shall not apply if the employee demonstrates that an
  6 30 alternative business practice exists that would serve the same
  6 31 business purpose without producing the wage differential.
  6 32    The bill provides that affirmative defenses to a claim under
  6 33 Code section 216.6A are not applicable unless one or more of
  6 34 the defenses account for the entire pay differential that is
  6 35 the subject of the claim.
  7  1 EQUAL PAY TASK FORCE.  The bill creates an equal pay task
  7  2 force to study the extent of discriminatory wage disparities
  7  3 in the public and private sectors, the factors that cause
  7  4 such disparities, the consequences of such disparities, and
  7  5 actions likely to lead to the elimination and prevention of
  7  6 such disparities.
  7  7    The bill establishes the membership of the task force,
  7  8 including ex officio, nonvoting legislative members. The civil
  7  9 rights commission shall provide staffing services for the task
  7 10 force.

  5  3 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  5  4 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  5  5    This bill relates to wage discrimination under Iowa Code
  5  6 chapter 216, the Iowa civil rights Act of 1965, and establishes
  5  7 an equal pay task force.
  5  8    WAGE DISCRIMINATION IN EMPLOYMENT.  The bill establishes
  5  9 additional unfair or discriminatory practices relating to wages
  5 10 under Code section 216.6A.  Penalty and remedial provisions
  5 11 for discriminatory employment practices, including penalties
  5 12 specific to wage discrimination, are applicable under Code
  5 13 chapter 216 to violations of these requirements.
  5 14    The bill prohibits an employer from requiring that an
  5 15 employee refrain from disclosing, discussing, or sharing
  5 16 information about the amount of the employee's wages, benefits,
  5 17 or other compensation or from inquiring, discussing, or sharing
  5 18 information about any other employee's wages, benefits, or
  5 19 other compensation as a condition of employment. The bill
  5 20 prohibits an employer from requiring that an employee sign a
  5 21 waiver or other document that requires an employee to refrain
  5 22 from engaging in any of those activities as a condition of
  5 23 employment. The bill prohibits an employer from discriminating
  5 24 or retaliating against an employee for engaging in any of the
  5 25 activities.
  5 26    The bill prohibits an employer from seeking salary history
  5 27 information from a potential employee as a condition of a job
  5 28 interview or employment. This provision shall not be construed
  5 29 to prohibit a prospective employer from asking a prospective
  5 30 employee what salary level the prospective employee would
  5 31 require in order to accept a job.
  5 32    The bill prohibits an employer from releasing the salary
  5 33 history of any current or former employee to any prospective
  5 34 employer in response to a request as part of an interview or
  5 35 hiring process without written authorization from such current
  6  1 or former employee.
  6  2    The bill prohibits an employer from publishing, listing, or

  6  5 public manner, an advertisement to recruit candidates for
  6  6 hire or independent contractors to fill a position within the
  6  7 employer's organization without including the minimum rate of

  6 10 including but not limited to tipped wages. The bill prohibits
  6 11 an employer from paying a newly hired employee at less than the
  6 12 rate of pay advertised for the employee's position.
  6 13    Under current law, an employer has an affirmative defense
  6 14 to a claim under Code section 216.6A if a pay differential
  6 15 is based on any other factor other than prohibited wage

  6 18 pay differential is based on any other bona fide factor other
  6 19 than prohibited discrimination, including but not limited
  6 20 to a bona fide factor relating to education, training, or
  6 21 experience. However, this defense shall only apply if the
  6 22 employer demonstrates that the factor is not based on or
  6 23 derived from prohibited wage discrimination, is job related
  6 24 with respect to the position in question, and is consistent
  6 25 with a business necessity. The bill defines "business

  6 29 defense shall not apply if the employee demonstrates that an

  6 32    The bill provides that affirmative defenses to a claim under

  6  9 and allowances, if any, claimed as part of the minimum wage,
  6 10 including but not limited to tipped wages. The bill prohibits
  6 11 an employer from paying a newly hired employee at less than the
  6 12 rate of pay advertised for the employee's position.
  6 13    Under current law, an employer has an affirmative defense
  6 14 to a claim under Code section 216.6A if a pay differential
  6 15 is based on any other factor other than prohibited wage
  6 16 discrimination. The bill provides that an employer has an
  6 17 affirmative defense to a claim under Code section 216.6A if a
  6 18 pay differential is based on any other bona fide factor other
  6 19 than prohibited discrimination, including but not limited
  6 20 to a bona fide factor relating to education, training, or
  6 21 experience. However, this defense shall only apply if the
  6 22 employer demonstrates that the factor is not based on or
  6 23 derived from prohibited wage discrimination, is job related
  6 24 with respect to the position in question, and is consistent
  6 25 with a business necessity. The bill defines "business
  6 26 necessity" as an overriding legitimate business purpose
  6 27 such that the factor relied upon effectively fulfills the
  6 28 business purpose it is supposed to serve. This affirmative
  6 29 defense shall not apply if the employee demonstrates that an
  6 30 alternative business practice exists that would serve the same
  6 31 business purpose without producing the wage differential.
  6 32    The bill provides that affirmative defenses to a claim under
  6 33 Code section 216.6A are not applicable unless one or more of
  6 34 the defenses account for the entire pay differential that is
  6 35 the subject of the claim.
  7  1 EQUAL PAY TASK FORCE.  The bill creates an equal pay task
  7  2 force to study the extent of discriminatory wage disparities
  7  3 in the public and private sectors, the factors that cause
  7  4 such disparities, the consequences of such disparities, and
  7  5 actions likely to lead to the elimination and prevention of
  7  6 such disparities.
  7  7    The bill establishes the membership of the task force,
  7  8 including ex officio, nonvoting legislative members. The civil
  7  9 rights commission shall provide staffing services for the task
  7 10 force.
  7 11    The task force shall submit a report regarding its findings
  7 12 and its recommendations regarding potential actions for the
  7 13 elimination and prevention of discriminatory wage disparities
  7 14 to the governor and the general assembly no later than December

  5  2                           EXPLANATION
  5  3 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  5  4 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  5  5    This bill relates to wage discrimination under Iowa Code
  5  6 chapter 216, the Iowa civil rights Act of 1965, and establishes
  5  7 an equal pay task force.
  5  8    WAGE DISCRIMINATION IN EMPLOYMENT.  The bill establishes
  5  9 additional unfair or discriminatory practices relating to wages
  5 10 under Code section 216.6A.  Penalty and remedial provisions
  5 11 for discriminatory employment practices, including penalties
  5 12 specific to wage discrimination, are applicable under Code
  5 13 chapter 216 to violations of these requirements.
  5 14    The bill prohibits an employer from requiring that an
  5 15 employee refrain from disclosing, discussing, or sharing
  5 16 information about the amount of the employee's wages, benefits,
  5 17 or other compensation or from inquiring, discussing, or sharing
  5 18 information about any other employee's wages, benefits, or
  5 19 other compensation as a condition of employment. The bill
  5 20 prohibits an employer from requiring that an employee sign a
  5 21 waiver or other document that requires an employee to refrain
  5 22 from engaging in any of those activities as a condition of
  5 23 employment. The bill prohibits an employer from discriminating
  5 24 or retaliating against an employee for engaging in any of the
  5 25 activities.
  5 26    The bill prohibits an employer from seeking salary history
  5 27 information from a potential employee as a condition of a job
  5 28 interview or employment. This provision shall not be construed
  5 29 to prohibit a prospective employer from asking a prospective
  5 30 employee what salary level the prospective employee would
  5 31 require in order to accept a job.
  5 32    The bill prohibits an employer from releasing the salary
  5 33 history of any current or former employee to any prospective
  5 34 employer in response to a request as part of an interview or
  5 35 hiring process without written authorization from such current
  6  1 or former employee.
  6  2    The bill prohibits an employer from publishing, listing, or
  6  3 posting within the employer's organization, with any employment
  6  4 agency, job=listing service, or internet site, or in any other
  6  5 public manner, an advertisement to recruit candidates for
  6  6 hire or independent contractors to fill a position within the
  6  7 employer's organization without including the minimum rate of
  6  8 pay of the position. The rate of pay shall include overtime
  6  9 and allowances, if any, claimed as part of the minimum wage,
  6 10 including but not limited to tipped wages. The bill prohibits
  6 11 an employer from paying a newly hired employee at less than the
  6 12 rate of pay advertised for the employee's position.
  6 13    Under current law, an employer has an affirmative defense
  6 14 to a claim under Code section 216.6A if a pay differential
  6 15 is based on any other factor other than prohibited wage
  6 16 discrimination. The bill provides that an employer has an
  6 17 affirmative defense to a claim under Code section 216.6A if a
  6 18 pay differential is based on any other bona fide factor other
  6 19 than prohibited discrimination, including but not limited
  6 20 to a bona fide factor relating to education, training, or
  6 21 experience. However, this defense shall only apply if the
  6 22 employer demonstrates that the factor is not based on or
  6 23 derived from prohibited wage discrimination, is job related
  6 24 with respect to the position in question, and is consistent
  6 25 with a business necessity. The bill defines "business
  6 26 necessity" as an overriding legitimate business purpose
  6 27 such that the factor relied upon effectively fulfills the
  6 28 business purpose it is supposed to serve. This affirmative
  6 29 defense shall not apply if the employee demonstrates that an
  6 30 alternative business practice exists that would serve the same
  6 31 business purpose without producing the wage differential.
  6 32    The bill provides that affirmative defenses to a claim under
  6 33 Code section 216.6A are not applicable unless one or more of
  6 34 the defenses account for the entire pay differential that is
  6 35 the subject of the claim.

  5  2                           EXPLANATION
  5  3 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  5  4 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  5  5    This bill relates to wage discrimination under Iowa Code
  5  6 chapter 216, the Iowa civil rights Act of 1965, and establishes
  5  7 an equal pay task force.
  5  8    WAGE DISCRIMINATION IN EMPLOYMENT.  The bill establishes
  5  9 additional unfair or discriminatory practices relating to wages
  5 10 under Code section 216.6A.  Penalty and remedial provisions
  5 11 for discriminatory employment practices, including penalties
  5 12 specific to wage discrimination, are applicable under Code
  5 13 chapter 216 to violations of these requirements.
  5 14    The bill prohibits an employer from requiring that an
  5 15 employee refrain from disclosing, discussing, or sharing
  5 16 information about the amount of the employee's wages, benefits,
  5 17 or other compensation or from inquiring, discussing, or sharing
  5 18 information about any other employee's wages, benefits, or
  5 19 other compensation as a condition of employment. The bill
  5 20 prohibits an employer from requiring that an employee sign a
  5 21 waiver or other document that requires an employee to refrain
  5 22 from engaging in any of those activities as a condition of
  5 23 employment. The bill prohibits an employer from discriminating
  5 24 or retaliating against an employee for engaging in any of the
  5 25 activities.
  5 26    The bill prohibits an employer from seeking salary history
  5 27 information from a potential employee as a condition of a job
  5 28 interview or employment. This provision shall not be construed
  5 29 to prohibit a prospective employer from asking a prospective
  5 30 employee what salary level the prospective employee would
  5 31 require in order to accept a job.
  5 32    The bill prohibits an employer from releasing the salary
  5 33 history of any current or former employee to any prospective
  5 34 employer in response to a request as part of an interview or
  5 35 hiring process without written authorization from such current
  6  1 or former employee.
  6  2    The bill prohibits an employer from publishing, listing, or
  6  3 posting within the employer's organization, with any employment
  6  4 agency, job=listing service, or internet site, or in any other
  6  5 public manner, an advertisement to recruit candidates for
  6  6 hire or independent contractors to fill a position within the
  6  7 employer's organization without including the minimum rate of
  6  8 pay of the position. The rate of pay shall include overtime
  6  9 and allowances, if any, claimed as part of the minimum wage,
  6 10 including but not limited to tipped wages. The bill prohibits
  6 11 an employer from paying a newly hired employee at less than the
  6 12 rate of pay advertised for the employee's position.
  6 13    Under current law, an employer has an affirmative defense
  6 14 to a claim under Code section 216.6A if a pay differential
  6 15 is based on any other factor other than prohibited wage
  6 16 discrimination. The bill provides that an employer has an
  6 17 affirmative defense to a claim under Code section 216.6A if a
  6 18 pay differential is based on any other bona fide factor other
  6 19 than prohibited discrimination, including but not limited
  6 20 to a bona fide factor relating to education, training, or
  6 21 experience. However, this defense shall only apply if the
  6 22 employer demonstrates that the factor is not based on or
  6 23 derived from prohibited wage discrimination, is job related
  6 24 with respect to the position in question, and is consistent
  6 25 with a business necessity. The bill defines "business
  6 26 necessity" as an overriding legitimate business purpose
  6 27 such that the factor relied upon effectively fulfills the
  6 28 business purpose it is supposed to serve. This affirmative
  6 29 defense shall not apply if the employee demonstrates that an
  6 30 alternative business practice exists that would serve the same
  6 31 business purpose without producing the wage differential.
  6 32    The bill provides that affirmative defenses to a claim under
  6 33 Code section 216.6A are not applicable unless one or more of
  6 34 the defenses account for the entire pay differential that is
  6 35 the subject of the claim.

  5  5    This bill relates to wage discrimination under Iowa Code
  5  6 chapter 216, the Iowa civil rights Act of 1965, and establishes
  5  7 an equal pay task force.
  5  8    WAGE DISCRIMINATION IN EMPLOYMENT.  The bill establishes

  5 10 under Code section 216.6A.  Penalty and remedial provisions
  5 11 for discriminatory employment practices, including penalties
  5 12 specific to wage discrimination, are applicable under Code
  5 13 chapter 216 to violations of these requirements.
  5 14    The bill prohibits an employer from requiring that an
  5 15 employee refrain from disclosing, discussing, or sharing
  5 16 information about the amount of the employee's wages, benefits,
  5 17 or other compensation or from inquiring, discussing, or sharing
  5 18 information about any other employee's wages, benefits, or

  5 20 prohibits an employer from requiring that an employee sign a
  5 21 waiver or other document that requires an employee to refrain
  5 22 from engaging in any of those activities as a condition of
  5 23 employment. The bill prohibits an employer from discriminating
  5 24 or retaliating against an employee for engaging in any of the
  5 25 activities.
  5 26    The bill prohibits an employer from seeking salary history
  5 27 information from a potential employee as a condition of a job
  5 28 interview or employment. This provision shall not be construed
  5 29 to prohibit a prospective employer from asking a prospective
  5 30 employee what salary level the prospective employee would
  5 31 require in order to accept a job.
  5 32    The bill prohibits an employer from releasing the salary
  5 33 history of any current or former employee to any prospective
  5 34 employer in response to a request as part of an interview or
  5 35 hiring process without written authorization from such current
  6  1 or former employee.
  6  2    The bill prohibits an employer from publishing, listing, or
  6  3 posting within the employer's organization, with any employment
  6  4 agency, job=listing service, or internet site, or in any other
  6  5 public manner, an advertisement to recruit candidates for
  6  6 hire or independent contractors to fill a position within the
  6  7 employer's organization without including the minimum rate of
  6  8 pay of the position. The rate of pay shall include overtime
  6  9 and allowances, if any, claimed as part of the minimum wage,
  6 10 including but not limited to tipped wages. The bill prohibits
  6 11 an employer from paying a newly hired employee at less than the
  6 12 rate of pay advertised for the employee's position.
  6 13    Under current law, an employer has an affirmative defense
  6 14 to a claim under Code section 216.6A if a pay differential
  6 15 is based on any other factor other than prohibited wage
  6 16 discrimination. The bill provides that an employer has an
  6 17 affirmative defense to a claim under Code section 216.6A if a
  6 18 pay differential is based on any other bona fide factor other
  6 19 than prohibited discrimination, including but not limited
  6 20 to a bona fide factor relating to education, training, or
  6 21 experience. However, this defense shall only apply if the
  6 22 employer demonstrates that the factor is not based on or
  6 23 derived from prohibited wage discrimination, is job related
  6 24 with respect to the position in question, and is consistent
  6 25 with a business necessity. The bill defines "business
  6 26 necessity" as an overriding legitimate business purpose
  6 27 such that the factor relied upon effectively fulfills the
  6 28 business purpose it is supposed to serve. This affirmative
  6 29 defense shall not apply if the employee demonstrates that an
  6 30 alternative business practice exists that would serve the same
  6 31 business purpose without producing the wage differential.
  6 32    The bill provides that affirmative defenses to a claim under
  6 33 Code section 216.6A are not applicable unless one or more of
  6 34 the defenses account for the entire pay differential that is
  6 35 the subject of the claim.

  5  2                           EXPLANATION
  5  3 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  5  4 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  5  5    This bill relates to wage discrimination under Iowa Code
  5  6 chapter 216, the Iowa civil rights Act of 1965, and establishes
  5  7 an equal pay task force.
  5  8    WAGE DISCRIMINATION IN EMPLOYMENT.  The bill establishes
  5  9 additional unfair or discriminatory practices relating to wages
  5 10 under Code section 216.6A.  Penalty and remedial provisions
  5 11 for discriminatory employment practices, including penalties
  5 12 specific to wage discrimination, are applicable under Code
  5 13 chapter 216 to violations of these requirements.
  5 14    The bill prohibits an employer from requiring that an
  5 15 employee refrain from disclosing, discussing, or sharing
  5 16 information about the amount of the employee's wages, benefits,
  5 17 or other compensation or from inquiring, discussing, or sharing
  5 18 information about any other employee's wages, benefits, or
  5 19 other compensation as a condition of employment. The bill
  5 20 prohibits an employer from requiring that an employee sign a
  5 21 waiver or other document that requires an employee to refrain
  5 22 from engaging in any of those activities as a condition of
  5 23 employment. The bill prohibits an employer from discriminating
  5 24 or retaliating against an employee for engaging in any of the
  5 25 activities.
  5 26    The bill prohibits an employer from seeking salary history
  5 27 information from a potential employee as a condition of a job
  5 28 interview or employment. This provision shall not be construed
  5 29 to prohibit a prospective employer from asking a prospective
  5 30 employee what salary level the prospective employee would
  5 31 require in order to accept a job.
  5 32    The bill prohibits an employer from releasing the salary
  5 33 history of any current or former employee to any prospective
  5 34 employer in response to a request as part of an interview or
  5 35 hiring process without written authorization from such current
  6  1 or former employee.
  6  2    The bill prohibits an employer from publishing, listing, or
  6  3 posting within the employer's organization, with any employment
  6  4 agency, job=listing service, or internet site, or in any other
  6  5 public manner, an advertisement to recruit candidates for
  6  6 hire or independent contractors to fill a position within the
  6  7 employer's organization without including the minimum rate of
  6  8 pay of the position. The rate of pay shall include overtime
  6  9 and allowances, if any, claimed as part of the minimum wage,
  6 10 including but not limited to tipped wages. The bill prohibits
  6 11 an employer from paying a newly hired employee at less than the
  6 12 rate of pay advertised for the employee's position.
  6 13    Under current law, an employer has an affirmative defense
  6 14 to a claim under Code section 216.6A if a pay differential
  6 15 is based on any other factor other than prohibited wage
  6 16 discrimination. The bill provides that an employer has an
  6 17 affirmative defense to a claim under Code section 216.6A if a
  6 18 pay differential is based on any other bona fide factor other
  6 19 than prohibited discrimination, including but not limited
  6 20 to a bona fide factor relating to education, training, or
  6 21 experience. However, this defense shall only apply if the
  6 22 employer demonstrates that the factor is not based on or
  6 23 derived from prohibited wage discrimination, is job related
  6 24 with respect to the position in question, and is consistent
  6 25 with a business necessity. The bill defines "business
  6 26 necessity" as an overriding legitimate business purpose
  6 27 such that the factor relied upon effectively fulfills the
  6 28 business purpose it is supposed to serve. This affirmative
  6 29 defense shall not apply if the employee demonstrates that an
  6 30 alternative business practice exists that would serve the same
  6 31 business purpose without producing the wage differential.
  6 32    The bill provides that affirmative defenses to a claim under
  6 33 Code section 216.6A are not applicable unless one or more of
  6 34 the defenses account for the entire pay differential that is
  6 35 the subject of the claim.
  7  1 EQUAL PAY TASK FORCE.  The bill creates an equal pay task
  7  2 force to study the extent of discriminatory wage disparities
  7  3 in the public and private sectors, the factors that cause
  7  4 such disparities, the consequences of such disparities, and
  7  5 actions likely to lead to the elimination and prevention of
  7  6 such disparities.
  7  7    The bill establishes the membership of the task force,
  7  8 including ex officio, nonvoting legislative members. The civil
  7  9 rights commission shall provide staffing services for the task
  7 10 force.
  7 11    The task force shall submit a report regarding its findings
  7 12 and its recommendations regarding potential actions for the
  7 13 elimination and prevention of discriminatory wage disparities
  7 14 to the governor and the general assembly no later than December
  7 15 22, 2017.

  5  1 2017.
  5  2                           EXPLANATION
  5  3 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  5  4 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  5  5    This bill relates to wage discrimination under Iowa Code
  5  6 chapter 216, the Iowa civil rights Act of 1965, and establishes
  5  7 an equal pay task force.
  5  8    WAGE DISCRIMINATION IN EMPLOYMENT.  The bill establishes
  5  9 additional unfair or discriminatory practices relating to wages
  5 10 under Code section 216.6A.  Penalty and remedial provisions
  5 11 for discriminatory employment practices, including penalties
  5 12 specific to wage discrimination, are applicable under Code
  5 13 chapter 216 to violations of these requirements.
  5 14    The bill prohibits an employer from requiring that an
  5 15 employee refrain from disclosing, discussing, or sharing
  5 16 information about the amount of the employee's wages, benefits,
  5 17 or other compensation or from inquiring, discussing, or sharing
  5 18 information about any other employee's wages, benefits, or
  5 19 other compensation as a condition of employment. The bill
  5 20 prohibits an employer from requiring that an employee sign a
  5 21 waiver or other document that requires an employee to refrain
  5 22 from engaging in any of those activities as a condition of
  5 23 employment. The bill prohibits an employer from discriminating
  5 24 or retaliating against an employee for engaging in any of the
  5 25 activities.
  5 26    The bill prohibits an employer from seeking salary history
  5 27 information from a potential employee as a condition of a job
  5 28 interview or employment. This provision shall not be construed
  5 29 to prohibit a prospective employer from asking a prospective
  5 30 employee what salary level the prospective employee would
  5 31 require in order to accept a job.
  5 32    The bill prohibits an employer from releasing the salary
  5 33 history of any current or former employee to any prospective
  5 34 employer in response to a request as part of an interview or
  5 35 hiring process without written authorization from such current
  6  1 or former employee.
  6  2    The bill prohibits an employer from publishing, listing, or
  6  3 posting within the employer's organization, with any employment
  6  4 agency, job=listing service, or internet site, or in any other
  6  5 public manner, an advertisement to recruit candidates for
  6  6 hire or independent contractors to fill a position within the
  6  7 employer's organization without including the minimum rate of
  6  8 pay of the position. The rate of pay shall include overtime
  6  9 and allowances, if any, claimed as part of the minimum wage,
  6 10 including but not limited to tipped wages. The bill prohibits
  6 11 an employer from paying a newly hired employee at less than the
  6 12 rate of pay advertised for the employee's position.
  6 13    Under current law, an employer has an affirmative defense
  6 14 to a claim under Code section 216.6A if a pay differential
  6 15 is based on any other factor other than prohibited wage
  6 16 discrimination. The bill provides that an employer has an
  6 17 affirmative defense to a claim under Code section 216.6A if a
  6 18 pay differential is based on any other bona fide factor other
  6 19 than prohibited discrimination, including but not limited
  6 20 to a bona fide factor relating to education, training, or
  6 21 experience. However, this defense shall only apply if the
  6 22 employer demonstrates that the factor is not based on or
  6 23 derived from prohibited wage discrimination, is job related
  6 24 with respect to the position in question, and is consistent
  6 25 with a business necessity. The bill defines "business
  6 26 necessity" as an overriding legitimate business purpose
  6 27 such that the factor relied upon effectively fulfills the
  6 28 business purpose it is supposed to serve. This affirmative
  6 29 defense shall not apply if the employee demonstrates that an
  6 30 alternative business practice exists that would serve the same
  6 31 business purpose without producing the wage differential.
  6 32    The bill provides that affirmative defenses to a claim under
  6 33 Code section 216.6A are not applicable unless one or more of
  6 34 the defenses account for the entire pay differential that is
  6 35 the subject of the claim.
  7  1 EQUAL PAY TASK FORCE.  The bill creates an equal pay task
  7  2 force to study the extent of discriminatory wage disparities
  7  3 in the public and private sectors, the factors that cause
  7  4 such disparities, the consequences of such disparities, and
  7  5 actions likely to lead to the elimination and prevention of
  7  6 such disparities.
  7  7    The bill establishes the membership of the task force,
  7  8 including ex officio, nonvoting legislative members. The civil
  7  9 rights commission shall provide staffing services for the task
  7 10 force.
  7 11    The task force shall submit a report regarding its findings
  7 12 and its recommendations regarding potential actions for the
  7 13 elimination and prevention of discriminatory wage disparities
  7 14 to the governor and the general assembly no later than December
  7 15 22, 2017.

  5  8    WAGE DISCRIMINATION IN EMPLOYMENT.  The bill establishes
  5  9 additional unfair or discriminatory practices relating to wages
  5 10 under Code section 216.6A.  Penalty and remedial provisions
  5 11 for discriminatory employment practices, including penalties
  5 12 specific to wage discrimination, are applicable under Code
  5 13 chapter 216 to violations of these requirements.
  5 14    The bill prohibits an employer from requiring that an
  5 15 employee refrain from disclosing, discussing, or sharing
  5 16 information about the amount of the employee's wages, benefits,
  5 17 or other compensation or from inquiring, discussing, or sharing
  5 18 information about any other employee's wages, benefits, or
  5 19 other compensation as a condition of employment. The bill
  5 20 prohibits an employer from requiring that an employee sign a
  5 21 waiver or other document that requires an employee to refrain
  5 22 from engaging in any of those activities as a condition of
  5 23 employment. The bill prohibits an employer from discriminating
  5 24 or retaliating against an employee for engaging in any of the
  5 25 activities.
  5 26    The bill prohibits an employer from seeking salary history
  5 27 information from a potential employee as a condition of a job
  5 28 interview or employment. This provision shall not be construed
  5 29 to prohibit a prospective employer from asking a prospective
  5 30 employee what salary level the prospective employee would
  5 31 require in order to accept a job.
  5 32    The bill prohibits an employer from releasing the salary

  5 34 employer in response to a request as part of an interview or
  5 35 hiring process without written authorization from such current

  6  2    The bill prohibits an employer from publishing, listing, or

  6 13    Under current law, an employer has an affirmative defense
  6 14 to a claim under Code section 216.6A if a pay differential
  6 15 is based on any other factor other than prohibited wage

  6 17 affirmative defense to a claim under Code section 216.6A if a
  6 18 pay differential is based on any other bona fide factor other
  6 19 than prohibited discrimination, including but not limited
  6 20 to a bona fide factor relating to education, training, or
  6 21 experience. However, this defense shall only apply if the
  6 22 employer demonstrates that the factor is not based on or
  6 23 derived from prohibited wage discrimination, is job related
  6 24 with respect to the position in question, and is consistent
  6 25 with a business necessity. The bill defines "business

  6 29 defense shall not apply if the employee demonstrates that an
  6 30 alternative business practice exists that would serve the same
  6 31 business purpose without producing the wage differential.
  6 32    The bill provides that affirmative defenses to a claim under
  6 33 Code section 216.6A are not applicable unless one or more of
  6 34 the defenses account for the entire pay differential that is
  6 35 the subject of the claim.

  5  6 chapter 216, the Iowa civil rights Act of 1965, and establishes
  5  7 an equal pay task force.
  5  8    WAGE DISCRIMINATION IN EMPLOYMENT.  The bill establishes
  5  9 additional unfair or discriminatory practices relating to wages
  5 10 under Code section 216.6A.  Penalty and remedial provisions
  5 11 for discriminatory employment practices, including penalties
  5 12 specific to wage discrimination, are applicable under Code

  6 13    Under current law, an employer has an affirmative defense
  6 14 to a claim under Code section 216.6A if a pay differential
  6 15 is based on any other factor other than prohibited wage
  6 16 discrimination. The bill provides that an employer has an
  6 17 affirmative defense to a claim under Code section 216.6A if a
  6 18 pay differential is based on any other bona fide factor other
  6 19 than prohibited discrimination, including but not limited
  6 20 to a bona fide factor relating to education, training, or
  6 21 experience. However, this defense shall only apply if the
  6 22 employer demonstrates that the factor is not based on or
  6 23 derived from prohibited wage discrimination, is job related
  6 24 with respect to the position in question, and is consistent
  6 25 with a business necessity. The bill defines "business
  6 26 necessity" as an overriding legitimate business purpose
  6 27 such that the factor relied upon effectively fulfills the
  6 28 business purpose it is supposed to serve. This affirmative
  6 29 defense shall not apply if the employee demonstrates that an
  6 30 alternative business practice exists that would serve the same
  6 31 business purpose without producing the wage differential.
  6 32    The bill provides that affirmative defenses to a claim under
  6 33 Code section 216.6A are not applicable unless one or more of
  6 34 the defenses account for the entire pay differential that is
  6 35 the subject of the claim.
  7  1 EQUAL PAY TASK FORCE.  The bill creates an equal pay task
  7  2 force to study the extent of discriminatory wage disparities
  7  3 in the public and private sectors, the factors that cause
  7  4 such disparities, the consequences of such disparities, and
  7  5 actions likely to lead to the elimination and prevention of
  7  6 such disparities.
  7  7    The bill establishes the membership of the task force,
  7  8 including ex officio, nonvoting legislative members. The civil
  7  9 rights commission shall provide staffing services for the task
  7 10 force.
  7 11    The task force shall submit a report regarding its findings
  7 12 and its recommendations regarding potential actions for the
  7 13 elimination and prevention of discriminatory wage disparities
  7 14 to the governor and the general assembly no later than December
  7 15 22, 2017.

  5  2                           EXPLANATION
  5  3 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  5  4 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  5  5    This bill relates to wage discrimination under Iowa Code
  5  6 chapter 216, the Iowa civil rights Act of 1965, and establishes
  5  7 an equal pay task force.
  5  8    WAGE DISCRIMINATION IN EMPLOYMENT.  The bill establishes
  5  9 additional unfair or discriminatory practices relating to wages
  5 10 under Code section 216.6A.  Penalty and remedial provisions
  5 11 for discriminatory employment practices, including penalties
  5 12 specific to wage discrimination, are applicable under Code
  5 13 chapter 216 to violations of these requirements.
  5 14    The bill prohibits an employer from requiring that an
  5 15 employee refrain from disclosing, discussing, or sharing
  5 16 information about the amount of the employee's wages, benefits,
  5 17 or other compensation or from inquiring, discussing, or sharing
  5 18 information about any other employee's wages, benefits, or
  5 19 other compensation as a condition of employment. The bill
  5 20 prohibits an employer from requiring that an employee sign a
  5 21 waiver or other document that requires an employee to refrain
  5 22 from engaging in any of those activities as a condition of
  5 23 employment. The bill prohibits an employer from discriminating
  5 24 or retaliating against an employee for engaging in any of the
  5 25 activities.
  5 26    The bill prohibits an employer from seeking salary history
  5 27 information from a potential employee as a condition of a job
  5 28 interview or employment. This provision shall not be construed
  5 29 to prohibit a prospective employer from asking a prospective
  5 30 employee what salary level the prospective employee would
  5 31 require in order to accept a job.
  5 32    The bill prohibits an employer from releasing the salary
  5 33 history of any current or former employee to any prospective
  5 34 employer in response to a request as part of an interview or
  5 35 hiring process without written authorization from such current
  6  1 or former employee.
  6  2    The bill prohibits an employer from publishing, listing, or
  6  3 posting within the employer's organization, with any employment
  6  4 agency, job=listing service, or internet site, or in any other
  6  5 public manner, an advertisement to recruit candidates for
  6  6 hire or independent contractors to fill a position within the
  6  7 employer's organization without including the minimum rate of
  6  8 pay of the position. The rate of pay shall include overtime
  6  9 and allowances, if any, claimed as part of the minimum wage,
  6 10 including but not limited to tipped wages. The bill prohibits
  6 11 an employer from paying a newly hired employee at less than the
  6 12 rate of pay advertised for the employee's position.
  6 13    Under current law, an employer has an affirmative defense
  6 14 to a claim under Code section 216.6A if a pay differential
  6 15 is based on any other factor other than prohibited wage
  6 16 discrimination. The bill provides that an employer has an
  6 17 affirmative defense to a claim under Code section 216.6A if a
  6 18 pay differential is based on any other bona fide factor other
  6 19 than prohibited discrimination, including but not limited
  6 20 to a bona fide factor relating to education, training, or
  6 21 experience. However, this defense shall only apply if the
  6 22 employer demonstrates that the factor is not based on or
  6 23 derived from prohibited wage discrimination, is job related
  6 24 with respect to the position in question, and is consistent
  6 25 with a business necessity. The bill defines "business
  6 26 necessity" as an overriding legitimate business purpose
  6 27 such that the factor relied upon effectively fulfills the
  6 28 business purpose it is supposed to serve. This affirmative
  6 29 defense shall not apply if the employee demonstrates that an
  6 30 alternative business practice exists that would serve the same
  6 31 business purpose without producing the wage differential.
  6 32    The bill provides that affirmative defenses to a claim under
  6 33 Code section 216.6A are not applicable unless one or more of
  6 34 the defenses account for the entire pay differential that is
  6 35 the subject of the claim.
  7  1 EQUAL PAY TASK FORCE.  The bill creates an equal pay task
  7  2 force to study the extent of discriminatory wage disparities
  7  3 in the public and private sectors, the factors that cause
  7  4 such disparities, the consequences of such disparities, and
  7  5 actions likely to lead to the elimination and prevention of
  7  6 such disparities.
  7  7    The bill establishes the membership of the task force,
  7  8 including ex officio, nonvoting legislative members. The civil
  7  9 rights commission shall provide staffing services for the task
  7 10 force.
  7 11    The task force shall submit a report regarding its findings
  7 12 and its recommendations regarding potential actions for the
  7 13 elimination and prevention of discriminatory wage disparities

  5  2                           EXPLANATION
  5  3 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  5  4 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  5  5    This bill relates to wage discrimination under Iowa Code
  5  6 chapter 216, the Iowa civil rights Act of 1965, and establishes
  5  7 an equal pay task force.
  5  8    WAGE DISCRIMINATION IN EMPLOYMENT.  The bill establishes
  5  9 additional unfair or discriminatory practices relating to wages
  5 10 under Code section 216.6A.  Penalty and remedial provisions
  5 11 for discriminatory employment practices, including penalties
  5 12 specific to wage discrimination, are applicable under Code
  5 13 chapter 216 to violations of these requirements.
  5 14    The bill prohibits an employer from requiring that an
  5 15 employee refrain from disclosing, discussing, or sharing
  5 16 information about the amount of the employee's wages, benefits,
  5 17 or other compensation or from inquiring, discussing, or sharing
  5 18 information about any other employee's wages, benefits, or
  5 19 other compensation as a condition of employment. The bill
  5 20 prohibits an employer from requiring that an employee sign a
  5 21 waiver or other document that requires an employee to refrain
  5 22 from engaging in any of those activities as a condition of
  5 23 employment. The bill prohibits an employer from discriminating
  5 24 or retaliating against an employee for engaging in any of the
  5 25 activities.
  5 26    The bill prohibits an employer from seeking salary history
  5 27 information from a potential employee as a condition of a job
  5 28 interview or employment. This provision shall not be construed
  5 29 to prohibit a prospective employer from asking a prospective
  5 30 employee what salary level the prospective employee would
  5 31 require in order to accept a job.
  5 32    The bill prohibits an employer from releasing the salary
  5 33 history of any current or former employee to any prospective
  5 34 employer in response to a request as part of an interview or
  5 35 hiring process without written authorization from such current
  6  1 or former employee.
  6  2    The bill prohibits an employer from publishing, listing, or

  6  4 agency, job=listing service, or internet site, or in any other
  6  5 public manner, an advertisement to recruit candidates for
  6  6 hire or independent contractors to fill a position within the
  6  7 employer's organization without including the minimum rate of
  6  8 pay of the position. The rate of pay shall include overtime
  6  9 and allowances, if any, claimed as part of the minimum wage,
  6 10 including but not limited to tipped wages. The bill prohibits
  6 11 an employer from paying a newly hired employee at less than the

  6 13    Under current law, an employer has an affirmative defense
  6 14 to a claim under Code section 216.6A if a pay differential
  6 15 is based on any other factor other than prohibited wage
  6 16 discrimination. The bill provides that an employer has an
  6 17 affirmative defense to a claim under Code section 216.6A if a
  6 18 pay differential is based on any other bona fide factor other
  6 19 than prohibited discrimination, including but not limited
  6 20 to a bona fide factor relating to education, training, or
  6 21 experience. However, this defense shall only apply if the
  6 22 employer demonstrates that the factor is not based on or
  6 23 derived from prohibited wage discrimination, is job related
  6 24 with respect to the position in question, and is consistent
  6 25 with a business necessity. The bill defines "business
  6 26 necessity" as an overriding legitimate business purpose
  6 27 such that the factor relied upon effectively fulfills the

  6 29 defense shall not apply if the employee demonstrates that an

  5 13 chapter 216 to violations of these requirements.
  5 14    The bill prohibits an employer from requiring that an
  5 15 employee refrain from disclosing, discussing, or sharing
  5 16 information about the amount of the employee's wages, benefits,
  5 17 or other compensation or from inquiring, discussing, or sharing
  5 18 information about any other employee's wages, benefits, or

  5 20 prohibits an employer from requiring that an employee sign a
  5 21 waiver or other document that requires an employee to refrain
  5 22 from engaging in any of those activities as a condition of
  5 23 employment. The bill prohibits an employer from discriminating
  5 24 or retaliating against an employee for engaging in any of the
  5 25 activities.
  5 26    The bill prohibits an employer from seeking salary history
  5 27 information from a potential employee as a condition of a job
  5 28 interview or employment. This provision shall not be construed
  5 29 to prohibit a prospective employer from asking a prospective
  5 30 employee what salary level the prospective employee would

  5  2                           EXPLANATION
  5  3 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  5  4 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  5  5    This bill relates to wage discrimination under Iowa Code
  5  6 chapter 216, the Iowa civil rights Act of 1965, and establishes
  5  7 an equal pay task force.
  5  8    WAGE DISCRIMINATION IN EMPLOYMENT.  The bill establishes
  5  9 additional unfair or discriminatory practices relating to wages
  5 10 under Code section 216.6A.  Penalty and remedial provisions
  5 11 for discriminatory employment practices, including penalties
  5 12 specific to wage discrimination, are applicable under Code
  5 13 chapter 216 to violations of these requirements.
  5 14    The bill prohibits an employer from requiring that an
  5 15 employee refrain from disclosing, discussing, or sharing
  5 16 information about the amount of the employee's wages, benefits,
  5 17 or other compensation or from inquiring, discussing, or sharing
  5 18 information about any other employee's wages, benefits, or
  5 19 other compensation as a condition of employment. The bill
  5 20 prohibits an employer from requiring that an employee sign a
  5 21 waiver or other document that requires an employee to refrain
  5 22 from engaging in any of those activities as a condition of
  5 23 employment. The bill prohibits an employer from discriminating
  5 24 or retaliating against an employee for engaging in any of the
  5 25 activities.
  5 26    The bill prohibits an employer from seeking salary history
  5 27 information from a potential employee as a condition of a job
  5 28 interview or employment. This provision shall not be construed
  5 29 to prohibit a prospective employer from asking a prospective
  5 30 employee what salary level the prospective employee would
  5 31 require in order to accept a job.
  5 32    The bill prohibits an employer from releasing the salary
  5 33 history of any current or former employee to any prospective
  5 34 employer in response to a request as part of an interview or
  5 35 hiring process without written authorization from such current
  6  1 or former employee.
  6  2    The bill prohibits an employer from publishing, listing, or
  6  3 posting within the employer's organization, with any employment
  6  4 agency, job=listing service, or internet site, or in any other
  6  5 public manner, an advertisement to recruit candidates for
  6  6 hire or independent contractors to fill a position within the
  6  7 employer's organization without including the minimum rate of
  6  8 pay of the position. The rate of pay shall include overtime
  6  9 and allowances, if any, claimed as part of the minimum wage,
  6 10 including but not limited to tipped wages. The bill prohibits
  6 11 an employer from paying a newly hired employee at less than the
  6 12 rate of pay advertised for the employee's position.
  6 13    Under current law, an employer has an affirmative defense
  6 14 to a claim under Code section 216.6A if a pay differential
  6 15 is based on any other factor other than prohibited wage
  6 16 discrimination. The bill provides that an employer has an
  6 17 affirmative defense to a claim under Code section 216.6A if a
  6 18 pay differential is based on any other bona fide factor other
  6 19 than prohibited discrimination, including but not limited
  6 20 to a bona fide factor relating to education, training, or
  6 21 experience. However, this defense shall only apply if the
  6 22 employer demonstrates that the factor is not based on or
  6 23 derived from prohibited wage discrimination, is job related
  6 24 with respect to the position in question, and is consistent
  6 25 with a business necessity. The bill defines "business
  6 26 necessity" as an overriding legitimate business purpose
  6 27 such that the factor relied upon effectively fulfills the
  6 28 business purpose it is supposed to serve. This affirmative
  6 29 defense shall not apply if the employee demonstrates that an
  6 30 alternative business practice exists that would serve the same
  6 31 business purpose without producing the wage differential.
  6 32    The bill provides that affirmative defenses to a claim under
  6 33 Code section 216.6A are not applicable unless one or more of
  6 34 the defenses account for the entire pay differential that is
  6 35 the subject of the claim.
  7  1 EQUAL PAY TASK FORCE.  The bill creates an equal pay task
  7  2 force to study the extent of discriminatory wage disparities
  7  3 in the public and private sectors, the factors that cause
  7  4 such disparities, the consequences of such disparities, and
  7  5 actions likely to lead to the elimination and prevention of
  7  6 such disparities.
  7  7    The bill establishes the membership of the task force,
  7  8 including ex officio, nonvoting legislative members. The civil
  7  9 rights commission shall provide staffing services for the task
  7 10 force.
  7 11    The task force shall submit a report regarding its findings
  7 12 and its recommendations regarding potential actions for the
  7 13 elimination and prevention of discriminatory wage disparities
  7 14 to the governor and the general assembly no later than December

  4 11 men and between minorities and nonminorities across and
  4 12 within occupations, payment of lower wages for work in
  4 13 female=dominated occupations, child=rearing responsibilities,
  4 14 the number of women who are heads of households, education,
  4 15 hours worked, and years on the job.

  4 26 reimbursement for actual expenses incurred while serving
  4 27 in their official capacity only if they are not eligible
  4 28 for reimbursement by the organization that they represent.
  4 29 Legislative members shall be paid the per diem and expenses
  4 30 specified in section 2.10.

  4 32 findings and its recommendations regarding potential actions
  4 33 for the elimination and prevention of disparities in wages
  4 34 between men and women and minorities and nonminorities to the

  5 13 chapter 216 to violations of these requirements.
  5 14    The bill prohibits an employer from requiring that an
  5 15 employee refrain from disclosing, discussing, or sharing
  5 16 information about the amount of the employee's wages, benefits,
  5 17 or other compensation or from inquiring, discussing, or sharing
  5 18 information about any other employee's wages, benefits, or
  5 19 other compensation as a condition of employment. The bill
  5 20 prohibits an employer from requiring that an employee sign a
  5 21 waiver or other document that requires an employee to refrain
  5 22 from engaging in any of those activities as a condition of
  5 23 employment. The bill prohibits an employer from discriminating
  5 24 or retaliating against an employee for engaging in any of the
  5 25 activities.
  5 26    The bill prohibits an employer from seeking salary history
  5 27 information from a potential employee as a condition of a job
  5 28 interview or employment. This provision shall not be construed
  5 29 to prohibit a prospective employer from asking a prospective
  5 30 employee what salary level the prospective employee would

  6 14 to a claim under Code section 216.6A if a pay differential
  6 15 is based on any other factor other than prohibited wage

  6 17 affirmative defense to a claim under Code section 216.6A if a
  6 18 pay differential is based on any other bona fide factor other
  6 19 than prohibited discrimination, including but not limited
  6 20 to a bona fide factor relating to education, training, or
  6 21 experience. However, this defense shall only apply if the
  6 22 employer demonstrates that the factor is not based on or
  6 23 derived from prohibited wage discrimination, is job related
  6 24 with respect to the position in question, and is consistent
  6 25 with a business necessity. The bill defines "business

  6 29 defense shall not apply if the employee demonstrates that an

  6 12 rate of pay advertised for the employee's position.
  6 13    Under current law, an employer has an affirmative defense
  6 14 to a claim under Code section 216.6A if a pay differential
  6 15 is based on any other factor other than prohibited wage
  6 16 discrimination. The bill provides that an employer has an
  6 17 affirmative defense to a claim under Code section 216.6A if a
  6 18 pay differential is based on any other bona fide factor other
  6 19 than prohibited discrimination, including but not limited
  6 20 to a bona fide factor relating to education, training, or
  6 21 experience. However, this defense shall only apply if the
  6 22 employer demonstrates that the factor is not based on or
  6 23 derived from prohibited wage discrimination, is job related
  6 24 with respect to the position in question, and is consistent
  6 25 with a business necessity. The bill defines "business
  6 26 necessity" as an overriding legitimate business purpose
  6 27 such that the factor relied upon effectively fulfills the
  6 28 business purpose it is supposed to serve. This affirmative
  6 29 defense shall not apply if the employee demonstrates that an
  6 30 alternative business practice exists that would serve the same
  6 31 business purpose without producing the wage differential.
  6 32    The bill provides that affirmative defenses to a claim under
  6 33 Code section 216.6A are not applicable unless one or more of
  6 34 the defenses account for the entire pay differential that is
  6 35 the subject of the claim.
  7  1 EQUAL PAY TASK FORCE.  The bill creates an equal pay task
  7  2 force to study the extent of discriminatory wage disparities
  7  3 in the public and private sectors, the factors that cause
  7  4 such disparities, the consequences of such disparities, and
  7  5 actions likely to lead to the elimination and prevention of
  7  6 such disparities.
  7  7    The bill establishes the membership of the task force,
  7  8 including ex officio, nonvoting legislative members. The civil
  7  9 rights commission shall provide staffing services for the task
  7 10 force.

  7 12 and its recommendations regarding potential actions for the
  7 13 elimination and prevention of discriminatory wage disparities

  5  3 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  5  4 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  5  5    This bill relates to wage discrimination under Iowa Code
  5  6 chapter 216, the Iowa civil rights Act of 1965, and establishes
  5  7 an equal pay task force.
  5  8    WAGE DISCRIMINATION IN EMPLOYMENT.  The bill establishes
  5  9 additional unfair or discriminatory practices relating to wages
  5 10 under Code section 216.6A.  Penalty and remedial provisions
  5 11 for discriminatory employment practices, including penalties
  5 12 specific to wage discrimination, are applicable under Code
  5 13 chapter 216 to violations of these requirements.
  5 14    The bill prohibits an employer from requiring that an
  5 15 employee refrain from disclosing, discussing, or sharing
  5 16 information about the amount of the employee's wages, benefits,
  5 17 or other compensation or from inquiring, discussing, or sharing
  5 18 information about any other employee's wages, benefits, or
  5 19 other compensation as a condition of employment. The bill
  5 20 prohibits an employer from requiring that an employee sign a
  5 21 waiver or other document that requires an employee to refrain
  5 22 from engaging in any of those activities as a condition of
  5 23 employment. The bill prohibits an employer from discriminating
  5 24 or retaliating against an employee for engaging in any of the
  5 25 activities.
  5 26    The bill prohibits an employer from seeking salary history
  5 27 information from a potential employee as a condition of a job
  5 28 interview or employment. This provision shall not be construed
  5 29 to prohibit a prospective employer from asking a prospective
  5 30 employee what salary level the prospective employee would
  5 31 require in order to accept a job.
  5 32    The bill prohibits an employer from releasing the salary
  5 33 history of any current or former employee to any prospective
  5 34 employer in response to a request as part of an interview or
  5 35 hiring process without written authorization from such current
  6  1 or former employee.
  6  2    The bill prohibits an employer from publishing, listing, or
  6  3 posting within the employer's organization, with any employment
  6  4 agency, job=listing service, or internet site, or in any other
  6  5 public manner, an advertisement to recruit candidates for
  6  6 hire or independent contractors to fill a position within the
  6  7 employer's organization without including the minimum rate of
  6  8 pay of the position. The rate of pay shall include overtime
  6  9 and allowances, if any, claimed as part of the minimum wage,
  6 10 including but not limited to tipped wages. The bill prohibits
  6 11 an employer from paying a newly hired employee at less than the
  6 12 rate of pay advertised for the employee's position.
  6 13    Under current law, an employer has an affirmative defense
  6 14 to a claim under Code section 216.6A if a pay differential
  6 15 is based on any other factor other than prohibited wage
  6 16 discrimination. The bill provides that an employer has an
  6 17 affirmative defense to a claim under Code section 216.6A if a
  6 18 pay differential is based on any other bona fide factor other
  6 19 than prohibited discrimination, including but not limited
  6 20 to a bona fide factor relating to education, training, or
  6 21 experience. However, this defense shall only apply if the
  6 22 employer demonstrates that the factor is not based on or
  6 23 derived from prohibited wage discrimination, is job related
  6 24 with respect to the position in question, and is consistent
  6 25 with a business necessity. The bill defines "business
  6 26 necessity" as an overriding legitimate business purpose
  6 27 such that the factor relied upon effectively fulfills the

  6 29 defense shall not apply if the employee demonstrates that an
  6 30 alternative business practice exists that would serve the same
  6 31 business purpose without producing the wage differential.
  6 32    The bill provides that affirmative defenses to a claim under
  6 33 Code section 216.6A are not applicable unless one or more of
  6 34 the defenses account for the entire pay differential that is
  6 35 the subject of the claim.

  5  6 chapter 216, the Iowa civil rights Act of 1965, and establishes
  5  7 an equal pay task force.
  5  8    WAGE DISCRIMINATION IN EMPLOYMENT.  The bill establishes
  5  9 additional unfair or discriminatory practices relating to wages
  5 10 under Code section 216.6A.  Penalty and remedial provisions
  5 11 for discriminatory employment practices, including penalties
  5 12 specific to wage discrimination, are applicable under Code
  5 13 chapter 216 to violations of these requirements.
  5 14    The bill prohibits an employer from requiring that an
  5 15 employee refrain from disclosing, discussing, or sharing
  5 16 information about the amount of the employee's wages, benefits,
  5 17 or other compensation or from inquiring, discussing, or sharing
  5 18 information about any other employee's wages, benefits, or
  5 19 other compensation as a condition of employment. The bill
  5 20 prohibits an employer from requiring that an employee sign a
  5 21 waiver or other document that requires an employee to refrain
  5 22 from engaging in any of those activities as a condition of
  5 23 employment. The bill prohibits an employer from discriminating
  5 24 or retaliating against an employee for engaging in any of the
  5 25 activities.
  5 26    The bill prohibits an employer from seeking salary history
  5 27 information from a potential employee as a condition of a job
  5 28 interview or employment. This provision shall not be construed
  5 29 to prohibit a prospective employer from asking a prospective
  5 30 employee what salary level the prospective employee would
  5 31 require in order to accept a job.
  5 32    The bill prohibits an employer from releasing the salary
  5 33 history of any current or former employee to any prospective
  5 34 employer in response to a request as part of an interview or
  5 35 hiring process without written authorization from such current
  6  1 or former employee.
  6  2    The bill prohibits an employer from publishing, listing, or
  6  3 posting within the employer's organization, with any employment
  6  4 agency, job=listing service, or internet site, or in any other
  6  5 public manner, an advertisement to recruit candidates for
  6  6 hire or independent contractors to fill a position within the
  6  7 employer's organization without including the minimum rate of
  6  8 pay of the position. The rate of pay shall include overtime
  6  9 and allowances, if any, claimed as part of the minimum wage,
  6 10 including but not limited to tipped wages. The bill prohibits
  6 11 an employer from paying a newly hired employee at less than the
  6 12 rate of pay advertised for the employee's position.
  6 13    Under current law, an employer has an affirmative defense
  6 14 to a claim under Code section 216.6A if a pay differential
  6 15 is based on any other factor other than prohibited wage
  6 16 discrimination. The bill provides that an employer has an
  6 17 affirmative defense to a claim under Code section 216.6A if a
  6 18 pay differential is based on any other bona fide factor other
  6 19 than prohibited discrimination, including but not limited
  6 20 to a bona fide factor relating to education, training, or
  6 21 experience. However, this defense shall only apply if the
  6 22 employer demonstrates that the factor is not based on or
  6 23 derived from prohibited wage discrimination, is job related
  6 24 with respect to the position in question, and is consistent
  6 25 with a business necessity. The bill defines "business
  6 26 necessity" as an overriding legitimate business purpose
  6 27 such that the factor relied upon effectively fulfills the
  6 28 business purpose it is supposed to serve. This affirmative
  6 29 defense shall not apply if the employee demonstrates that an
  6 30 alternative business practice exists that would serve the same
  6 31 business purpose without producing the wage differential.
  6 32    The bill provides that affirmative defenses to a claim under
  6 33 Code section 216.6A are not applicable unless one or more of
  6 34 the defenses account for the entire pay differential that is
  6 35 the subject of the claim.
  7  1 EQUAL PAY TASK FORCE.  The bill creates an equal pay task
  7  2 force to study the extent of discriminatory wage disparities
  7  3 in the public and private sectors, the factors that cause
  7  4 such disparities, the consequences of such disparities, and
  7  5 actions likely to lead to the elimination and prevention of
  7  6 such disparities.
  7  7    The bill establishes the membership of the task force,
  7  8 including ex officio, nonvoting legislative members. The civil
  7  9 rights commission shall provide staffing services for the task
  7 10 force.

  7 12 and its recommendations regarding potential actions for the
  7 13 elimination and prevention of discriminatory wage disparities

  5  2                           EXPLANATION
  5  3 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  5  4 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  5  5    This bill relates to wage discrimination under Iowa Code
  5  6 chapter 216, the Iowa civil rights Act of 1965, and establishes
  5  7 an equal pay task force.
  5  8    WAGE DISCRIMINATION IN EMPLOYMENT.  The bill establishes
  5  9 additional unfair or discriminatory practices relating to wages
  5 10 under Code section 216.6A.  Penalty and remedial provisions
  5 11 for discriminatory employment practices, including penalties
  5 12 specific to wage discrimination, are applicable under Code
  5 13 chapter 216 to violations of these requirements.
  5 14    The bill prohibits an employer from requiring that an
  5 15 employee refrain from disclosing, discussing, or sharing
  5 16 information about the amount of the employee's wages, benefits,
  5 17 or other compensation or from inquiring, discussing, or sharing
  5 18 information about any other employee's wages, benefits, or
  5 19 other compensation as a condition of employment. The bill
  5 20 prohibits an employer from requiring that an employee sign a
  5 21 waiver or other document that requires an employee to refrain
  5 22 from engaging in any of those activities as a condition of
  5 23 employment. The bill prohibits an employer from discriminating
  5 24 or retaliating against an employee for engaging in any of the
  5 25 activities.
  5 26    The bill prohibits an employer from seeking salary history
  5 27 information from a potential employee as a condition of a job
  5 28 interview or employment. This provision shall not be construed
  5 29 to prohibit a prospective employer from asking a prospective
  5 30 employee what salary level the prospective employee would
  5 31 require in order to accept a job.
  5 32    The bill prohibits an employer from releasing the salary
  5 33 history of any current or former employee to any prospective
  5 34 employer in response to a request as part of an interview or
  5 35 hiring process without written authorization from such current
  6  1 or former employee.
  6  2    The bill prohibits an employer from publishing, listing, or
  6  3 posting within the employer's organization, with any employment
  6  4 agency, job=listing service, or internet site, or in any other
  6  5 public manner, an advertisement to recruit candidates for
  6  6 hire or independent contractors to fill a position within the
  6  7 employer's organization without including the minimum rate of
  6  8 pay of the position. The rate of pay shall include overtime
  6  9 and allowances, if any, claimed as part of the minimum wage,
  6 10 including but not limited to tipped wages. The bill prohibits
  6 11 an employer from paying a newly hired employee at less than the
  6 12 rate of pay advertised for the employee's position.
  6 13    Under current law, an employer has an affirmative defense
  6 14 to a claim under Code section 216.6A if a pay differential
  6 15 is based on any other factor other than prohibited wage
  6 16 discrimination. The bill provides that an employer has an
  6 17 affirmative defense to a claim under Code section 216.6A if a
  6 18 pay differential is based on any other bona fide factor other
  6 19 than prohibited discrimination, including but not limited
  6 20 to a bona fide factor relating to education, training, or
  6 21 experience. However, this defense shall only apply if the
  6 22 employer demonstrates that the factor is not based on or
  6 23 derived from prohibited wage discrimination, is job related
  6 24 with respect to the position in question, and is consistent
  6 25 with a business necessity. The bill defines "business
  6 26 necessity" as an overriding legitimate business purpose
  6 27 such that the factor relied upon effectively fulfills the
  6 28 business purpose it is supposed to serve. This affirmative
  6 29 defense shall not apply if the employee demonstrates that an
  6 30 alternative business practice exists that would serve the same
  6 31 business purpose without producing the wage differential.
  6 32    The bill provides that affirmative defenses to a claim under
  6 33 Code section 216.6A are not applicable unless one or more of
  6 34 the defenses account for the entire pay differential that is
  6 35 the subject of the claim.
  7  1 EQUAL PAY TASK FORCE.  The bill creates an equal pay task
  7  2 force to study the extent of discriminatory wage disparities
  7  3 in the public and private sectors, the factors that cause
  7  4 such disparities, the consequences of such disparities, and
  7  5 actions likely to lead to the elimination and prevention of
  7  6 such disparities.
  7  7    The bill establishes the membership of the task force,
  7  8 including ex officio, nonvoting legislative members. The civil
  7  9 rights commission shall provide staffing services for the task
  7 10 force.
  7 11    The task force shall submit a report regarding its findings
  7 12 and its recommendations regarding potential actions for the
  7 13 elimination and prevention of discriminatory wage disparities
  7 14 to the governor and the general assembly no later than December

  5  2                           EXPLANATION
  5  3 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  5  4 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  5  5    This bill relates to wage discrimination under Iowa Code
  5  6 chapter 216, the Iowa civil rights Act of 1965, and establishes
  5  7 an equal pay task force.
  5  8    WAGE DISCRIMINATION IN EMPLOYMENT.  The bill establishes
  5  9 additional unfair or discriminatory practices relating to wages
  5 10 under Code section 216.6A.  Penalty and remedial provisions
  5 11 for discriminatory employment practices, including penalties
  5 12 specific to wage discrimination, are applicable under Code
  5 13 chapter 216 to violations of these requirements.
  5 14    The bill prohibits an employer from requiring that an
  5 15 employee refrain from disclosing, discussing, or sharing
  5 16 information about the amount of the employee's wages, benefits,
  5 17 or other compensation or from inquiring, discussing, or sharing
  5 18 information about any other employee's wages, benefits, or
  5 19 other compensation as a condition of employment. The bill
  5 20 prohibits an employer from requiring that an employee sign a
  5 21 waiver or other document that requires an employee to refrain
  5 22 from engaging in any of those activities as a condition of
  5 23 employment. The bill prohibits an employer from discriminating
  5 24 or retaliating against an employee for engaging in any of the
  5 25 activities.
  5 26    The bill prohibits an employer from seeking salary history
  5 27 information from a potential employee as a condition of a job
  5 28 interview or employment. This provision shall not be construed
  5 29 to prohibit a prospective employer from asking a prospective
  5 30 employee what salary level the prospective employee would
  5 31 require in order to accept a job.
  5 32    The bill prohibits an employer from releasing the salary
  5 33 history of any current or former employee to any prospective
  5 34 employer in response to a request as part of an interview or
  5 35 hiring process without written authorization from such current
  6  1 or former employee.
  6  2    The bill prohibits an employer from publishing, listing, or
  6  3 posting within the employer's organization, with any employment
  6  4 agency, job=listing service, or internet site, or in any other
  6  5 public manner, an advertisement to recruit candidates for
  6  6 hire or independent contractors to fill a position within the
  6  7 employer's organization without including the minimum rate of
  6  8 pay of the position. The rate of pay shall include overtime
  6  9 and allowances, if any, claimed as part of the minimum wage,
  6 10 including but not limited to tipped wages. The bill prohibits
  6 11 an employer from paying a newly hired employee at less than the
  6 12 rate of pay advertised for the employee's position.
  6 13    Under current law, an employer has an affirmative defense
  6 14 to a claim under Code section 216.6A if a pay differential
  6 15 is based on any other factor other than prohibited wage
  6 16 discrimination. The bill provides that an employer has an
  6 17 affirmative defense to a claim under Code section 216.6A if a
  6 18 pay differential is based on any other bona fide factor other
  6 19 than prohibited discrimination, including but not limited
  6 20 to a bona fide factor relating to education, training, or
  6 21 experience. However, this defense shall only apply if the
  6 22 employer demonstrates that the factor is not based on or
  6 23 derived from prohibited wage discrimination, is job related
  6 24 with respect to the position in question, and is consistent
  6 25 with a business necessity. The bill defines "business
  6 26 necessity" as an overriding legitimate business purpose
  6 27 such that the factor relied upon effectively fulfills the
  6 28 business purpose it is supposed to serve. This affirmative
  6 29 defense shall not apply if the employee demonstrates that an
  6 30 alternative business practice exists that would serve the same
  6 31 business purpose without producing the wage differential.
  6 32    The bill provides that affirmative defenses to a claim under
  6 33 Code section 216.6A are not applicable unless one or more of
  6 34 the defenses account for the entire pay differential that is
  6 35 the subject of the claim.
  7  1 EQUAL PAY TASK FORCE.  The bill creates an equal pay task
  7  2 force to study the extent of discriminatory wage disparities
  7  3 in the public and private sectors, the factors that cause
  7  4 such disparities, the consequences of such disparities, and
  7  5 actions likely to lead to the elimination and prevention of
  7  6 such disparities.
  7  7    The bill establishes the membership of the task force,
  7  8 including ex officio, nonvoting legislative members. The civil
  7  9 rights commission shall provide staffing services for the task
  7 10 force.
  7 11    The task force shall submit a report regarding its findings
  7 12 and its recommendations regarding potential actions for the
  7 13 elimination and prevention of discriminatory wage disparities

  5  2                           EXPLANATION
  5  3 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  5  4 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  5  5    This bill relates to wage discrimination under Iowa Code
  5  6 chapter 216, the Iowa civil rights Act of 1965, and establishes
  5  7 an equal pay task force.
  5  8    WAGE DISCRIMINATION IN EMPLOYMENT.  The bill establishes
  5  9 additional unfair or discriminatory practices relating to wages
  5 10 under Code section 216.6A.  Penalty and remedial provisions
  5 11 for discriminatory employment practices, including penalties
  5 12 specific to wage discrimination, are applicable under Code
  5 13 chapter 216 to violations of these requirements.
  5 14    The bill prohibits an employer from requiring that an
  5 15 employee refrain from disclosing, discussing, or sharing
  5 16 information about the amount of the employee's wages, benefits,
  5 17 or other compensation or from inquiring, discussing, or sharing
  5 18 information about any other employee's wages, benefits, or
  5 19 other compensation as a condition of employment. The bill
  5 20 prohibits an employer from requiring that an employee sign a
  5 21 waiver or other document that requires an employee to refrain
  5 22 from engaging in any of those activities as a condition of
  5 23 employment. The bill prohibits an employer from discriminating
  5 24 or retaliating against an employee for engaging in any of the
  5 25 activities.
  5 26    The bill prohibits an employer from seeking salary history
  5 27 information from a potential employee as a condition of a job
  5 28 interview or employment. This provision shall not be construed
  5 29 to prohibit a prospective employer from asking a prospective
  5 30 employee what salary level the prospective employee would
  5 31 require in order to accept a job.
  5 32    The bill prohibits an employer from releasing the salary
  5 33 history of any current or former employee to any prospective
  5 34 employer in response to a request as part of an interview or
  5 35 hiring process without written authorization from such current
  6  1 or former employee.
  6  2    The bill prohibits an employer from publishing, listing, or
  6  3 posting within the employer's organization, with any employment
  6  4 agency, job=listing service, or internet site, or in any other
  6  5 public manner, an advertisement to recruit candidates for
  6  6 hire or independent contractors to fill a position within the
  6  7 employer's organization without including the minimum rate of
  6  8 pay of the position. The rate of pay shall include overtime
  6  9 and allowances, if any, claimed as part of the minimum wage,
  6 10 including but not limited to tipped wages. The bill prohibits
  6 11 an employer from paying a newly hired employee at less than the
  6 12 rate of pay advertised for the employee's position.
  6 13    Under current law, an employer has an affirmative defense
  6 14 to a claim under Code section 216.6A if a pay differential
  6 15 is based on any other factor other than prohibited wage
  6 16 discrimination. The bill provides that an employer has an
  6 17 affirmative defense to a claim under Code section 216.6A if a
  6 18 pay differential is based on any other bona fide factor other
  6 19 than prohibited discrimination, including but not limited
  6 20 to a bona fide factor relating to education, training, or
  6 21 experience. However, this defense shall only apply if the
  6 22 employer demonstrates that the factor is not based on or
  6 23 derived from prohibited wage discrimination, is job related
  6 24 with respect to the position in question, and is consistent
  6 25 with a business necessity. The bill defines "business
  6 26 necessity" as an overriding legitimate business purpose
  6 27 such that the factor relied upon effectively fulfills the
  6 28 business purpose it is supposed to serve. This affirmative
  6 29 defense shall not apply if the employee demonstrates that an
  6 30 alternative business practice exists that would serve the same
  6 31 business purpose without producing the wage differential.
  6 32    The bill provides that affirmative defenses to a claim under
  6 33 Code section 216.6A are not applicable unless one or more of
  6 34 the defenses account for the entire pay differential that is
  6 35 the subject of the claim.
  7  1 EQUAL PAY TASK FORCE.  The bill creates an equal pay task
  7  2 force to study the extent of discriminatory wage disparities
  7  3 in the public and private sectors, the factors that cause
  7  4 such disparities, the consequences of such disparities, and
  7  5 actions likely to lead to the elimination and prevention of
  7  6 such disparities.
  7  7    The bill establishes the membership of the task force,
  7  8 including ex officio, nonvoting legislative members. The civil
  7  9 rights commission shall provide staffing services for the task
  7 10 force.

  7 12 and its recommendations regarding potential actions for the
  7 13 elimination and prevention of discriminatory wage disparities

  5  8    WAGE DISCRIMINATION IN EMPLOYMENT.  The bill establishes
  5  9 additional unfair or discriminatory practices relating to wages
  5 10 under Code section 216.6A.  Penalty and remedial provisions
  5 11 for discriminatory employment practices, including penalties
  5 12 specific to wage discrimination, are applicable under Code
  5 13 chapter 216 to violations of these requirements.
  5 14    The bill prohibits an employer from requiring that an
  5 15 employee refrain from disclosing, discussing, or sharing
  5 16 information about the amount of the employee's wages, benefits,
  5 17 or other compensation or from inquiring, discussing, or sharing
  5 18 information about any other employee's wages, benefits, or
  5 19 other compensation as a condition of employment. The bill
  5 20 prohibits an employer from requiring that an employee sign a
  5 21 waiver or other document that requires an employee to refrain
  5 22 from engaging in any of those activities as a condition of
  5 23 employment. The bill prohibits an employer from discriminating
  5 24 or retaliating against an employee for engaging in any of the
  5 25 activities.
  5 26    The bill prohibits an employer from seeking salary history
  5 27 information from a potential employee as a condition of a job
  5 28 interview or employment. This provision shall not be construed
  5 29 to prohibit a prospective employer from asking a prospective
  5 30 employee what salary level the prospective employee would
  5 31 require in order to accept a job.
  5 32    The bill prohibits an employer from releasing the salary
  5 33 history of any current or former employee to any prospective
  5 34 employer in response to a request as part of an interview or
  5 35 hiring process without written authorization from such current
  6  1 or former employee.
  6  2    The bill prohibits an employer from publishing, listing, or
  6  3 posting within the employer's organization, with any employment
  6  4 agency, job=listing service, or internet site, or in any other
  6  5 public manner, an advertisement to recruit candidates for
  6  6 hire or independent contractors to fill a position within the
  6  7 employer's organization without including the minimum rate of
  6  8 pay of the position. The rate of pay shall include overtime
  6  9 and allowances, if any, claimed as part of the minimum wage,
  6 10 including but not limited to tipped wages. The bill prohibits
  6 11 an employer from paying a newly hired employee at less than the
  6 12 rate of pay advertised for the employee's position.
  6 13    Under current law, an employer has an affirmative defense
  6 14 to a claim under Code section 216.6A if a pay differential
  6 15 is based on any other factor other than prohibited wage
  6 16 discrimination. The bill provides that an employer has an
  6 17 affirmative defense to a claim under Code section 216.6A if a
  6 18 pay differential is based on any other bona fide factor other
  6 19 than prohibited discrimination, including but not limited
  6 20 to a bona fide factor relating to education, training, or
  6 21 experience. However, this defense shall only apply if the
  6 22 employer demonstrates that the factor is not based on or
  6 23 derived from prohibited wage discrimination, is job related
  6 24 with respect to the position in question, and is consistent
  6 25 with a business necessity. The bill defines "business
  6 26 necessity" as an overriding legitimate business purpose
  6 27 such that the factor relied upon effectively fulfills the
  6 28 business purpose it is supposed to serve. This affirmative
  6 29 defense shall not apply if the employee demonstrates that an
  6 30 alternative business practice exists that would serve the same
  6 31 business purpose without producing the wage differential.
  6 32    The bill provides that affirmative defenses to a claim under
  6 33 Code section 216.6A are not applicable unless one or more of
  6 34 the defenses account for the entire pay differential that is
  6 35 the subject of the claim.
  7  1 EQUAL PAY TASK FORCE.  The bill creates an equal pay task
  7  2 force to study the extent of discriminatory wage disparities
  7  3 in the public and private sectors, the factors that cause
  7  4 such disparities, the consequences of such disparities, and
  7  5 actions likely to lead to the elimination and prevention of
  7  6 such disparities.
  7  7    The bill establishes the membership of the task force,
  7  8 including ex officio, nonvoting legislative members. The civil
  7  9 rights commission shall provide staffing services for the task
  7 10 force.
  7 11    The task force shall submit a report regarding its findings
  7 12 and its recommendations regarding potential actions for the
  7 13 elimination and prevention of discriminatory wage disparities
  7 14 to the governor and the general assembly no later than December

  6 13    Under current law, an employer has an affirmative defense
  6 14 to a claim under Code section 216.6A if a pay differential
  6 15 is based on any other factor other than prohibited wage
  6 16 discrimination. The bill provides that an employer has an
  6 17 affirmative defense to a claim under Code section 216.6A if a
  6 18 pay differential is based on any other bona fide factor other
  6 19 than prohibited discrimination, including but not limited
  6 20 to a bona fide factor relating to education, training, or
  6 21 experience. However, this defense shall only apply if the
  6 22 employer demonstrates that the factor is not based on or
  6 23 derived from prohibited wage discrimination, is job related
  6 24 with respect to the position in question, and is consistent
  6 25 with a business necessity. The bill defines "business
  6 26 necessity" as an overriding legitimate business purpose
  6 27 such that the factor relied upon effectively fulfills the
  6 28 business purpose it is supposed to serve. This affirmative
  6 29 defense shall not apply if the employee demonstrates that an
  6 30 alternative business practice exists that would serve the same
  6 31 business purpose without producing the wage differential.
  6 32    The bill provides that affirmative defenses to a claim under
  6 33 Code section 216.6A are not applicable unless one or more of
  6 34 the defenses account for the entire pay differential that is
  6 35 the subject of the claim.
  7  1 EQUAL PAY TASK FORCE.  The bill creates an equal pay task
  7  2 force to study the extent of discriminatory wage disparities
  7  3 in the public and private sectors, the factors that cause
  7  4 such disparities, the consequences of such disparities, and
  7  5 actions likely to lead to the elimination and prevention of
  7  6 such disparities.
  7  7    The bill establishes the membership of the task force,
  7  8 including ex officio, nonvoting legislative members. The civil
  7  9 rights commission shall provide staffing services for the task
  7 10 force.
  7 11    The task force shall submit a report regarding its findings
  7 12 and its recommendations regarding potential actions for the
  7 13 elimination and prevention of discriminatory wage disparities

  5  3 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  5  4 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  5  5    This bill relates to wage discrimination under Iowa Code
  5  6 chapter 216, the Iowa civil rights Act of 1965, and establishes
  5  7 an equal pay task force.
  5  8    WAGE DISCRIMINATION IN EMPLOYMENT.  The bill establishes
  5  9 additional unfair or discriminatory practices relating to wages
  5 10 under Code section 216.6A.  Penalty and remedial provisions
  5 11 for discriminatory employment practices, including penalties
  5 12 specific to wage discrimination, are applicable under Code
  5 13 chapter 216 to violations of these requirements.
  5 14    The bill prohibits an employer from requiring that an
  5 15 employee refrain from disclosing, discussing, or sharing
  5 16 information about the amount of the employee's wages, benefits,
  5 17 or other compensation or from inquiring, discussing, or sharing
  5 18 information about any other employee's wages, benefits, or
  5 19 other compensation as a condition of employment. The bill
  5 20 prohibits an employer from requiring that an employee sign a
  5 21 waiver or other document that requires an employee to refrain
  5 22 from engaging in any of those activities as a condition of
  5 23 employment. The bill prohibits an employer from discriminating
  5 24 or retaliating against an employee for engaging in any of the
  5 25 activities.
  5 26    The bill prohibits an employer from seeking salary history
  5 27 information from a potential employee as a condition of a job
  5 28 interview or employment. This provision shall not be construed
  5 29 to prohibit a prospective employer from asking a prospective
  5 30 employee what salary level the prospective employee would
  5 31 require in order to accept a job.
  5 32    The bill prohibits an employer from releasing the salary
  5 33 history of any current or former employee to any prospective
  5 34 employer in response to a request as part of an interview or
  5 35 hiring process without written authorization from such current
  6  1 or former employee.
  6  2    The bill prohibits an employer from publishing, listing, or
  6  3 posting within the employer's organization, with any employment
  6  4 agency, job=listing service, or internet site, or in any other
  6  5 public manner, an advertisement to recruit candidates for
  6  6 hire or independent contractors to fill a position within the
  6  7 employer's organization without including the minimum rate of
  6  8 pay of the position. The rate of pay shall include overtime
  6  9 and allowances, if any, claimed as part of the minimum wage,
  6 10 including but not limited to tipped wages. The bill prohibits
  6 11 an employer from paying a newly hired employee at less than the
  6 12 rate of pay advertised for the employee's position.
  6 13    Under current law, an employer has an affirmative defense
  6 14 to a claim under Code section 216.6A if a pay differential
  6 15 is based on any other factor other than prohibited wage
  6 16 discrimination. The bill provides that an employer has an
  6 17 affirmative defense to a claim under Code section 216.6A if a
  6 18 pay differential is based on any other bona fide factor other
  6 19 than prohibited discrimination, including but not limited
  6 20 to a bona fide factor relating to education, training, or
  6 21 experience. However, this defense shall only apply if the
  6 22 employer demonstrates that the factor is not based on or
  6 23 derived from prohibited wage discrimination, is job related
  6 24 with respect to the position in question, and is consistent
  6 25 with a business necessity. The bill defines "business
  6 26 necessity" as an overriding legitimate business purpose
  6 27 such that the factor relied upon effectively fulfills the
  6 28 business purpose it is supposed to serve. This affirmative
  6 29 defense shall not apply if the employee demonstrates that an
  6 30 alternative business practice exists that would serve the same
  6 31 business purpose without producing the wage differential.
  6 32    The bill provides that affirmative defenses to a claim under
  6 33 Code section 216.6A are not applicable unless one or more of
  6 34 the defenses account for the entire pay differential that is
  6 35 the subject of the claim.

  6 26 necessity" as an overriding legitimate business purpose
  6 27 such that the factor relied upon effectively fulfills the

  6 31 business purpose without producing the wage differential.
  6 32    The bill provides that affirmative defenses to a claim under
  6 33 Code section 216.6A are not applicable unless one or more of
  6 34 the defenses account for the entire pay differential that is

  5 11 for discriminatory employment practices, including penalties
  5 12 specific to wage discrimination, are applicable under Code
  5 13 chapter 216 to violations of these requirements.
  5 14    The bill prohibits an employer from requiring that an
  5 15 employee refrain from disclosing, discussing, or sharing
  5 16 information about the amount of the employee's wages, benefits,
  5 17 or other compensation or from inquiring, discussing, or sharing
  5 18 information about any other employee's wages, benefits, or
  5 19 other compensation as a condition of employment. The bill
  5 20 prohibits an employer from requiring that an employee sign a
  5 21 waiver or other document that requires an employee to refrain
  5 22 from engaging in any of those activities as a condition of
  5 23 employment. The bill prohibits an employer from discriminating
  5 24 or retaliating against an employee for engaging in any of the
  5 25 activities.
  5 26    The bill prohibits an employer from seeking salary history
  5 27 information from a potential employee as a condition of a job
  5 28 interview or employment. This provision shall not be construed
  5 29 to prohibit a prospective employer from asking a prospective
  5 30 employee what salary level the prospective employee would
  5 31 require in order to accept a job.
  5 32    The bill prohibits an employer from releasing the salary
  5 33 history of any current or former employee to any prospective
  5 34 employer in response to a request as part of an interview or
  5 35 hiring process without written authorization from such current
  6  1 or former employee.
  6  2    The bill prohibits an employer from publishing, listing, or
  6  3 posting within the employer's organization, with any employment
  6  4 agency, job=listing service, or internet site, or in any other
  6  5 public manner, an advertisement to recruit candidates for
  6  6 hire or independent contractors to fill a position within the
  6  7 employer's organization without including the minimum rate of
  6  8 pay of the position. The rate of pay shall include overtime
  6  9 and allowances, if any, claimed as part of the minimum wage,
  6 10 including but not limited to tipped wages. The bill prohibits
  6 11 an employer from paying a newly hired employee at less than the
  6 12 rate of pay advertised for the employee's position.
  6 13    Under current law, an employer has an affirmative defense
  6 14 to a claim under Code section 216.6A if a pay differential
  6 15 is based on any other factor other than prohibited wage
  6 16 discrimination. The bill provides that an employer has an
  6 17 affirmative defense to a claim under Code section 216.6A if a
  6 18 pay differential is based on any other bona fide factor other
  6 19 than prohibited discrimination, including but not limited
  6 20 to a bona fide factor relating to education, training, or
  6 21 experience. However, this defense shall only apply if the
  6 22 employer demonstrates that the factor is not based on or
  6 23 derived from prohibited wage discrimination, is job related
  6 24 with respect to the position in question, and is consistent
  6 25 with a business necessity. The bill defines "business
  6 26 necessity" as an overriding legitimate business purpose
  6 27 such that the factor relied upon effectively fulfills the
  6 28 business purpose it is supposed to serve. This affirmative
  6 29 defense shall not apply if the employee demonstrates that an
  6 30 alternative business practice exists that would serve the same
  6 31 business purpose without producing the wage differential.
  6 32    The bill provides that affirmative defenses to a claim under
  6 33 Code section 216.6A are not applicable unless one or more of
  6 34 the defenses account for the entire pay differential that is
  6 35 the subject of the claim.
  7  1 EQUAL PAY TASK FORCE.  The bill creates an equal pay task
  7  2 force to study the extent of discriminatory wage disparities
  7  3 in the public and private sectors, the factors that cause

  5 25 activities.
  5 26    The bill prohibits an employer from seeking salary history
  5 27 information from a potential employee as a condition of a job

  6  5 public manner, an advertisement to recruit candidates for
  6  6 hire or independent contractors to fill a position within the
  6  7 employer's organization without including the minimum rate of
  6  8 pay of the position. The rate of pay shall include overtime
  6  9 and allowances, if any, claimed as part of the minimum wage,
  6 10 including but not limited to tipped wages. The bill prohibits
  6 11 an employer from paying a newly hired employee at less than the
  6 12 rate of pay advertised for the employee's position.
  6 13    Under current law, an employer has an affirmative defense
  6 14 to a claim under Code section 216.6A if a pay differential
  6 15 is based on any other factor other than prohibited wage
  6 16 discrimination. The bill provides that an employer has an
  6 17 affirmative defense to a claim under Code section 216.6A if a
  6 18 pay differential is based on any other bona fide factor other
  6 19 than prohibited discrimination, including but not limited
  6 20 to a bona fide factor relating to education, training, or
  6 21 experience. However, this defense shall only apply if the
  6 22 employer demonstrates that the factor is not based on or
  6 23 derived from prohibited wage discrimination, is job related
  6 24 with respect to the position in question, and is consistent
  6 25 with a business necessity. The bill defines "business
  6 26 necessity" as an overriding legitimate business purpose
  6 27 such that the factor relied upon effectively fulfills the
  6 28 business purpose it is supposed to serve. This affirmative
  6 29 defense shall not apply if the employee demonstrates that an
  6 30 alternative business practice exists that would serve the same
  6 31 business purpose without producing the wage differential.
  6 32    The bill provides that affirmative defenses to a claim under
  6 33 Code section 216.6A are not applicable unless one or more of
  6 34 the defenses account for the entire pay differential that is
  6 35 the subject of the claim.

  5  2                           EXPLANATION
  5  3 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  5  4 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  5  5    This bill relates to wage discrimination under Iowa Code
  5  6 chapter 216, the Iowa civil rights Act of 1965, and establishes
  5  7 an equal pay task force.
  5  8    WAGE DISCRIMINATION IN EMPLOYMENT.  The bill establishes
  5  9 additional unfair or discriminatory practices relating to wages
  5 10 under Code section 216.6A.  Penalty and remedial provisions
  5 11 for discriminatory employment practices, including penalties
  5 12 specific to wage discrimination, are applicable under Code
  5 13 chapter 216 to violations of these requirements.
  5 14    The bill prohibits an employer from requiring that an
  5 15 employee refrain from disclosing, discussing, or sharing
  5 16 information about the amount of the employee's wages, benefits,
  5 17 or other compensation or from inquiring, discussing, or sharing
  5 18 information about any other employee's wages, benefits, or
  5 19 other compensation as a condition of employment. The bill
  5 20 prohibits an employer from requiring that an employee sign a
  5 21 waiver or other document that requires an employee to refrain
  5 22 from engaging in any of those activities as a condition of
  5 23 employment. The bill prohibits an employer from discriminating
  5 24 or retaliating against an employee for engaging in any of the
  5 25 activities.
  5 26    The bill prohibits an employer from seeking salary history
  5 27 information from a potential employee as a condition of a job
  5 28 interview or employment. This provision shall not be construed
  5 29 to prohibit a prospective employer from asking a prospective
  5 30 employee what salary level the prospective employee would
  5 31 require in order to accept a job.
  5 32    The bill prohibits an employer from releasing the salary
  5 33 history of any current or former employee to any prospective
  5 34 employer in response to a request as part of an interview or
  5 35 hiring process without written authorization from such current
  6  1 or former employee.
  6  2    The bill prohibits an employer from publishing, listing, or
  6  3 posting within the employer's organization, with any employment
  6  4 agency, job=listing service, or internet site, or in any other
  6  5 public manner, an advertisement to recruit candidates for
  6  6 hire or independent contractors to fill a position within the
  6  7 employer's organization without including the minimum rate of
  6  8 pay of the position. The rate of pay shall include overtime
  6  9 and allowances, if any, claimed as part of the minimum wage,
  6 10 including but not limited to tipped wages. The bill prohibits
  6 11 an employer from paying a newly hired employee at less than the
  6 12 rate of pay advertised for the employee's position.
  6 13    Under current law, an employer has an affirmative defense
  6 14 to a claim under Code section 216.6A if a pay differential
  6 15 is based on any other factor other than prohibited wage
  6 16 discrimination. The bill provides that an employer has an
  6 17 affirmative defense to a claim under Code section 216.6A if a
  6 18 pay differential is based on any other bona fide factor other
  6 19 than prohibited discrimination, including but not limited
  6 20 to a bona fide factor relating to education, training, or
  6 21 experience. However, this defense shall only apply if the
  6 22 employer demonstrates that the factor is not based on or
  6 23 derived from prohibited wage discrimination, is job related
  6 24 with respect to the position in question, and is consistent
  6 25 with a business necessity. The bill defines "business
  6 26 necessity" as an overriding legitimate business purpose
  6 27 such that the factor relied upon effectively fulfills the
  6 28 business purpose it is supposed to serve. This affirmative
  6 29 defense shall not apply if the employee demonstrates that an
  6 30 alternative business practice exists that would serve the same
  6 31 business purpose without producing the wage differential.
  6 32    The bill provides that affirmative defenses to a claim under
  6 33 Code section 216.6A are not applicable unless one or more of
  6 34 the defenses account for the entire pay differential that is
  6 35 the subject of the claim.
  7  1 EQUAL PAY TASK FORCE.  The bill creates an equal pay task
  7  2 force to study the extent of discriminatory wage disparities
  7  3 in the public and private sectors, the factors that cause
  7  4 such disparities, the consequences of such disparities, and
  7  5 actions likely to lead to the elimination and prevention of
  7  6 such disparities.
  7  7    The bill establishes the membership of the task force,
  7  8 including ex officio, nonvoting legislative members. The civil
  7  9 rights commission shall provide staffing services for the task
  7 10 force.
  7 11    The task force shall submit a report regarding its findings
  7 12 and its recommendations regarding potential actions for the
  7 13 elimination and prevention of discriminatory wage disparities
  7 14 to the governor and the general assembly no later than December
  7 15 22, 2017.

  5 20 prohibits an employer from requiring that an employee sign a

  5 26    The bill prohibits an employer from seeking salary history
  5 27 information from a potential employee as a condition of a job

  6 17 affirmative defense to a claim under Code section 216.6A if a
  6 18 pay differential is based on any other bona fide factor other
  6 19 than prohibited discrimination, including but not limited
  6 20 to a bona fide factor relating to education, training, or
  6 21 experience. However, this defense shall only apply if the
  6 22 employer demonstrates that the factor is not based on or
  6 23 derived from prohibited wage discrimination, is job related
  6 24 with respect to the position in question, and is consistent
  6 25 with a business necessity. The bill defines "business
  6 26 necessity" as an overriding legitimate business purpose

  6 32    The bill provides that affirmative defenses to a claim under

  5 26    The bill prohibits an employer from seeking salary history
  5 27 information from a potential employee as a condition of a job
  5 28 interview or employment. This provision shall not be construed

  6  5 public manner, an advertisement to recruit candidates for
  6  6 hire or independent contractors to fill a position within the

  6 26 necessity" as an overriding legitimate business purpose
  6 27 such that the factor relied upon effectively fulfills the
