  8 13      8 13      8 14                           EXPLANATION
  8 15 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  8 16 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  8 17    This bill provides for the impoundment of a motor vehicle
  8 18 operated by a person whose driver's license or operating
  8 19 privilege has been denied, canceled, suspended, or revoked in
  8 20 violation of Code section 321.218. The impoundment procedures
  8 21 set forth in the bill are similar to those set forth in Code
  8 22 section 321J.4B, which deals with vehicle impoundment related
  8 23 to operating=while=intoxicated offenses. The bill provides
  8 24 that a vehicle operated by a person in violation of Code
  8 25 section 321.218 may be immediately impounded.
  8 26    Under the bill, the owner of an impounded motor vehicle
  8 27 who knows of, should have known of, or gives consent to the
  8 28 operation of the vehicle in violation of Code section 321.218
  8 29 is guilty of a simple misdemeanor and jointly and severally
  8 30 liable for any damages caused by the person who operated the
  8 31 vehicle. A simple misdemeanor is punishable by a fine of at
  8 32 least $65 but not to exceed $625 and imprisonment not to exceed
  8 33 30 days.
  8 34    The bill provides that certain persons are entitled to
  8 35 immediate return of the impounded vehicle without payment of
  9  1 costs, including the owner of the vehicle if the person who
  9  2 operated the vehicle is not a co=owner, a motor vehicle rental
  9  3 or leasing agency that owns the vehicle, and a person who
  9  4 owns the vehicle and who is charged but not convicted of the
  9  5 violation which resulted in the impoundment.
  9  6    A person shall be entitled to immediate return of the vehicle
  9  7 after payment of costs associated with the impoundment if
  9  8 the person is an owner of the vehicle, the person's criminal
  9  9 charge that resulted in the impoundment is pending, and the
  9 10 period of impoundment that would be required if the person was
  9 11 convicted of the offense has expired. A person who paid the
  9 12 costs associated with the impoundment shall be reimbursed by
  9 13 the person or agency who received the payment if the person is
  9 14 not convicted of the violation.
  9 15    The bill provides that a court may order the continued
  9 16 impoundment of the vehicle if the convicted person is the owner
  9 17 of the vehicle and the required period of impoundment has not
  9 18 expired. The period of impoundment of a vehicle under the bill
  9 19 is seven days for a first offense. For a second or subsequent
  9 20 offense, the period of impoundment is double the number of days
  9 21 required for the previous offense. For example, for a third
  9 22 offense, the period is 28 days, and for a fifth offense, the
  9 23 period is 112 days.
  9 24    The bill requires the clerk of the district court to send a
  9 25 copy of the order to the department of transportation (DOT),
  9 26 the person convicted of the offense, the person or agency
  9 27 responsible for executing the order for impoundment, and any
  9 28 holders of any security interests in the vehicle.
  9 29    The bill provides that the person or agency responsible for
  9 30 executing the order shall, upon receipt of the order, promptly
  9 31 locate the vehicle specified in the order, seize the vehicle
  9 32 and the registration plates, arrange for the vehicle to be
  9 33 moved to the place of impoundment, and send or deliver the
  9 34 vehicle's registration plates to the DOT.
  9 35    If the person or agency responsible for impounding the
 10  1 vehicle determines that the costs of impoundment exceed the
 10  2 actual wholesale value of the vehicle, the person or agency
 10  3 may treat the vehicle as an abandoned vehicle and notify the
 10  4 registered owner that the vehicle shall be deemed abandoned and
 10  5 shall be sold if payment of the total cost of impoundment is
 10  6 not received within 21 days.
 10  7    The bill requires the DOT to destroy registration plates
 10  8 received under the bill and prohibits the DOT from authorizing
 10  9 the release of the vehicle or issuing new plates for the
 10 10 vehicle until the period of impoundment has expired and the
 10 11 costs have been paid.
 10 12    The bill provides that the court shall assess to the person,
 10 13 in addition to any other penalty, the amount of any expenses
 10 14 for towing, storage, and any other costs of impounding the
 10 15 vehicle. However, the amount assessed to the person for
 10 16 storage of the vehicle shall not exceed $25 per day.
 10 17    The bill prohibits operating a motor vehicle in violation
 10 18 of an order for impoundment, and provides that a violation is
 10 19 a serious misdemeanor. A serious misdemeanor is punishable
 10 20 by a fine of at least $315 but not more than $1,875, and
 10 21 imprisonment not to exceed one year. In addition, the bill
 10 22 provides that a motor vehicle which is subject to an order
 10 23 for impoundment that is operated on a street or highway shall
 10 24 be seized and forfeited to the state under Code chapters 809
 10 25 (disposition of seized property) and 809A (forfeiture reform
 10 26 Act).
 10 27    Once the period of impoundment has expired, the owner of
 10 28 the vehicle shall have 30 days to claim the vehicle and pay
 10 29 all charges. If the owner has not claimed the vehicle and
 10 30 paid all charges within seven days from the date of expiration
 10 31 of the period, the bill requires the clerk to send written
 10 32 notification to the vehicle owner, at the owner's last known
 10 33 address, notifying the owner of the date of expiration of the
 10 34 period of impoundment and of the period in which the vehicle
 10 35 must be claimed. If the vehicle owner fails to claim the
 11  1 vehicle and pay all charges imposed within the 30=day period,
 11  2 the vehicle shall be forfeited to the state under Code chapters
 11  3 809 and 809A.
 11  4    During the period of impoundment, the bill prohibits the
 11  5 owner of an impounded vehicle from selling or transferring the
 11  6 title of the vehicle and from purchasing or registering any
 11  7 other vehicle. A violation of this provision is a serious
 11  8 misdemeanor. However, a court may permit transfer of the title
 11  9 in certain circumstances, and is required to notify the DOT of
 11 10 the title transfer.
 11 11    The bill requires that upon learning the address or phone
 11 12 number of a rental or leasing company which owns an impounded
 11 13 vehicle, the peace officer, county attorney, or attorney
 11 14 general shall immediately contact the company to inform
 11 15 the company that the vehicle is available for return to the
 11 16 company. The holder of a security interest in a vehicle which
 11 17 is impounded or forfeited shall be notified of the impoundment
 11 18 or forfeiture within 72 hours of the seizure of the vehicle and
 11 19 shall have the right to claim the vehicle without payment of
 11 20 any fees or surcharges unless the value of the vehicle exceeds
 11 21 the value of the security interest held by the creditor.
 11 22    The bill provides that certain persons may apply to the
 11 23 court for permission to operate a vehicle which is impounded,
 11 24 including a person other than the person who committed the
 11 25 offense who is not a member of the immediate family of the
 11 26 person who committed the offense but is a joint owner of the
 11 27 vehicle, and a member of the immediate family of the person
 11 28 who committed the offense if the member demonstrates that the
 11 29 vehicle is the only vehicle possessed by the family.
 11 30    The impoundment or forfeiture of a motor vehicle under the
 11 31 bill does not constitute loss of use of a vehicle for purposes
 11 32 of any contract of insurance.

  8 26    Under the bill, the owner of an impounded motor vehicle
  8 27 who knows of, should have known of, or gives consent to the
  8 28 operation of the vehicle in violation of Code section 321.218
  8 29 is guilty of a simple misdemeanor and jointly and severally
  8 30 liable for any damages caused by the person who operated the
  8 31 vehicle. A simple misdemeanor is punishable by a fine of at

  9  3 or leasing agency that owns the vehicle, and a person who
  9  4 owns the vehicle and who is charged but not convicted of the
  9  5 violation which resulted in the impoundment.
  9  6    A person shall be entitled to immediate return of the vehicle

  9 29    The bill provides that the person or agency responsible for
  9 30 executing the order shall, upon receipt of the order, promptly
  9 31 locate the vehicle specified in the order, seize the vehicle
  9 32 and the registration plates, arrange for the vehicle to be
  9 33 moved to the place of impoundment, and send or deliver the
  9 34 vehicle's registration plates to the DOT.
  9 35    If the person or agency responsible for impounding the
 10  1 vehicle determines that the costs of impoundment exceed the
 10  2 actual wholesale value of the vehicle, the person or agency
 10  3 may treat the vehicle as an abandoned vehicle and notify the
 10  4 registered owner that the vehicle shall be deemed abandoned and
 10  5 shall be sold if payment of the total cost of impoundment is
 10  6 not received within 21 days.
 10  7    The bill requires the DOT to destroy registration plates
 10  8 received under the bill and prohibits the DOT from authorizing
 10  9 the release of the vehicle or issuing new plates for the
 10 10 vehicle until the period of impoundment has expired and the
 10 11 costs have been paid.
 10 12    The bill provides that the court shall assess to the person,
 10 13 in addition to any other penalty, the amount of any expenses
 10 14 for towing, storage, and any other costs of impounding the
 10 15 vehicle. However, the amount assessed to the person for
 10 16 storage of the vehicle shall not exceed $25 per day.
 10 17    The bill prohibits operating a motor vehicle in violation
 10 18 of an order for impoundment, and provides that a violation is
 10 19 a serious misdemeanor. A serious misdemeanor is punishable
 10 20 by a fine of at least $315 but not more than $1,875, and
 10 21 imprisonment not to exceed one year. In addition, the bill
 10 22 provides that a motor vehicle which is subject to an order
 10 23 for impoundment that is operated on a street or highway shall
 10 24 be seized and forfeited to the state under Code chapters 809
 10 25 (disposition of seized property) and 809A (forfeiture reform
 10 26 Act).
 10 27    Once the period of impoundment has expired, the owner of
 10 28 the vehicle shall have 30 days to claim the vehicle and pay
 10 29 all charges. If the owner has not claimed the vehicle and
 10 30 paid all charges within seven days from the date of expiration
 10 31 of the period, the bill requires the clerk to send written
 10 32 notification to the vehicle owner, at the owner's last known
 10 33 address, notifying the owner of the date of expiration of the
 10 34 period of impoundment and of the period in which the vehicle
 10 35 must be claimed. If the vehicle owner fails to claim the
 11  1 vehicle and pay all charges imposed within the 30=day period,
 11  2 the vehicle shall be forfeited to the state under Code chapters
 11  3 809 and 809A.
 11  4    During the period of impoundment, the bill prohibits the
 11  5 owner of an impounded vehicle from selling or transferring the
 11  6 title of the vehicle and from purchasing or registering any
 11  7 other vehicle. A violation of this provision is a serious
 11  8 misdemeanor. However, a court may permit transfer of the title
 11  9 in certain circumstances, and is required to notify the DOT of
 11 10 the title transfer.
 11 11    The bill requires that upon learning the address or phone
 11 12 number of a rental or leasing company which owns an impounded
 11 13 vehicle, the peace officer, county attorney, or attorney
 11 14 general shall immediately contact the company to inform
 11 15 the company that the vehicle is available for return to the
 11 16 company. The holder of a security interest in a vehicle which
 11 17 is impounded or forfeited shall be notified of the impoundment
 11 18 or forfeiture within 72 hours of the seizure of the vehicle and
 11 19 shall have the right to claim the vehicle without payment of
 11 20 any fees or surcharges unless the value of the vehicle exceeds
 11 21 the value of the security interest held by the creditor.
 11 22    The bill provides that certain persons may apply to the
 11 23 court for permission to operate a vehicle which is impounded,
 11 24 including a person other than the person who committed the
 11 25 offense who is not a member of the immediate family of the
 11 26 person who committed the offense but is a joint owner of the
 11 27 vehicle, and a member of the immediate family of the person
 11 28 who committed the offense if the member demonstrates that the
 11 29 vehicle is the only vehicle possessed by the family.
 11 30    The impoundment or forfeiture of a motor vehicle under the
 11 31 bill does not constitute loss of use of a vehicle for purposes
 11 32 of any contract of insurance.

  8 16 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  8 17    This bill provides for the impoundment of a motor vehicle
  8 18 operated by a person whose driver's license or operating
  8 19 privilege has been denied, canceled, suspended, or revoked in
  8 20 violation of Code section 321.218. The impoundment procedures
  8 21 set forth in the bill are similar to those set forth in Code
  8 22 section 321J.4B, which deals with vehicle impoundment related
  8 23 to operating=while=intoxicated offenses. The bill provides
  8 24 that a vehicle operated by a person in violation of Code
  8 25 section 321.218 may be immediately impounded.
  8 26    Under the bill, the owner of an impounded motor vehicle
  8 27 who knows of, should have known of, or gives consent to the
  8 28 operation of the vehicle in violation of Code section 321.218
  8 29 is guilty of a simple misdemeanor and jointly and severally
  8 30 liable for any damages caused by the person who operated the
  8 31 vehicle. A simple misdemeanor is punishable by a fine of at
  8 32 least $65 but not to exceed $625 and imprisonment not to exceed
  8 33 30 days.
  8 34    The bill provides that certain persons are entitled to
  8 35 immediate return of the impounded vehicle without payment of
  9  1 costs, including the owner of the vehicle if the person who
  9  2 operated the vehicle is not a co=owner, a motor vehicle rental
  9  3 or leasing agency that owns the vehicle, and a person who
  9  4 owns the vehicle and who is charged but not convicted of the
  9  5 violation which resulted in the impoundment.
  9  6    A person shall be entitled to immediate return of the vehicle
  9  7 after payment of costs associated with the impoundment if
  9  8 the person is an owner of the vehicle, the person's criminal
  9  9 charge that resulted in the impoundment is pending, and the
  9 10 period of impoundment that would be required if the person was
  9 11 convicted of the offense has expired. A person who paid the
  9 12 costs associated with the impoundment shall be reimbursed by
  9 13 the person or agency who received the payment if the person is
  9 14 not convicted of the violation.
  9 15    The bill provides that a court may order the continued
  9 16 impoundment of the vehicle if the convicted person is the owner
  9 17 of the vehicle and the required period of impoundment has not
  9 18 expired. The period of impoundment of a vehicle under the bill
  9 19 is seven days for a first offense. For a second or subsequent
  9 20 offense, the period of impoundment is double the number of days
  9 21 required for the previous offense. For example, for a third
  9 22 offense, the period is 28 days, and for a fifth offense, the
  9 23 period is 112 days.
  9 24    The bill requires the clerk of the district court to send a
  9 25 copy of the order to the department of transportation (DOT),
  9 26 the person convicted of the offense, the person or agency
  9 27 responsible for executing the order for impoundment, and any
  9 28 holders of any security interests in the vehicle.
  9 29    The bill provides that the person or agency responsible for
  9 30 executing the order shall, upon receipt of the order, promptly
  9 31 locate the vehicle specified in the order, seize the vehicle
  9 32 and the registration plates, arrange for the vehicle to be
  9 33 moved to the place of impoundment, and send or deliver the
  9 34 vehicle's registration plates to the DOT.
  9 35    If the person or agency responsible for impounding the
 10  1 vehicle determines that the costs of impoundment exceed the
 10  2 actual wholesale value of the vehicle, the person or agency
 10  3 may treat the vehicle as an abandoned vehicle and notify the
 10  4 registered owner that the vehicle shall be deemed abandoned and
 10  5 shall be sold if payment of the total cost of impoundment is
 10  6 not received within 21 days.
 10  7    The bill requires the DOT to destroy registration plates
 10  8 received under the bill and prohibits the DOT from authorizing
 10  9 the release of the vehicle or issuing new plates for the
 10 10 vehicle until the period of impoundment has expired and the
 10 11 costs have been paid.
 10 12    The bill provides that the court shall assess to the person,
 10 13 in addition to any other penalty, the amount of any expenses
 10 14 for towing, storage, and any other costs of impounding the
 10 15 vehicle. However, the amount assessed to the person for
 10 16 storage of the vehicle shall not exceed $25 per day.
 10 17    The bill prohibits operating a motor vehicle in violation
 10 18 of an order for impoundment, and provides that a violation is
 10 19 a serious misdemeanor. A serious misdemeanor is punishable
 10 20 by a fine of at least $315 but not more than $1,875, and
 10 21 imprisonment not to exceed one year. In addition, the bill
 10 22 provides that a motor vehicle which is subject to an order
 10 23 for impoundment that is operated on a street or highway shall
 10 24 be seized and forfeited to the state under Code chapters 809
 10 25 (disposition of seized property) and 809A (forfeiture reform
 10 26 Act).
 10 27    Once the period of impoundment has expired, the owner of
 10 28 the vehicle shall have 30 days to claim the vehicle and pay
 10 29 all charges. If the owner has not claimed the vehicle and
 10 30 paid all charges within seven days from the date of expiration
 10 31 of the period, the bill requires the clerk to send written
 10 32 notification to the vehicle owner, at the owner's last known
 10 33 address, notifying the owner of the date of expiration of the
 10 34 period of impoundment and of the period in which the vehicle
 10 35 must be claimed. If the vehicle owner fails to claim the
 11  1 vehicle and pay all charges imposed within the 30=day period,
 11  2 the vehicle shall be forfeited to the state under Code chapters
 11  3 809 and 809A.
 11  4    During the period of impoundment, the bill prohibits the
 11  5 owner of an impounded vehicle from selling or transferring the
 11  6 title of the vehicle and from purchasing or registering any
 11  7 other vehicle. A violation of this provision is a serious
 11  8 misdemeanor. However, a court may permit transfer of the title
 11  9 in certain circumstances, and is required to notify the DOT of
 11 10 the title transfer.
 11 11    The bill requires that upon learning the address or phone
 11 12 number of a rental or leasing company which owns an impounded
 11 13 vehicle, the peace officer, county attorney, or attorney
 11 14 general shall immediately contact the company to inform
 11 15 the company that the vehicle is available for return to the
 11 16 company. The holder of a security interest in a vehicle which
 11 17 is impounded or forfeited shall be notified of the impoundment
 11 18 or forfeiture within 72 hours of the seizure of the vehicle and
 11 19 shall have the right to claim the vehicle without payment of
 11 20 any fees or surcharges unless the value of the vehicle exceeds
 11 21 the value of the security interest held by the creditor.
 11 22    The bill provides that certain persons may apply to the
 11 23 court for permission to operate a vehicle which is impounded,
 11 24 including a person other than the person who committed the
 11 25 offense who is not a member of the immediate family of the
 11 26 person who committed the offense but is a joint owner of the
 11 27 vehicle, and a member of the immediate family of the person
 11 28 who committed the offense if the member demonstrates that the
 11 29 vehicle is the only vehicle possessed by the family.

  8 18 operated by a person whose driver's license or operating
  8 19 privilege has been denied, canceled, suspended, or revoked in
  8 20 violation of Code section 321.218. The impoundment procedures
  8 21 set forth in the bill are similar to those set forth in Code
  8 22 section 321J.4B, which deals with vehicle impoundment related
  8 23 to operating=while=intoxicated offenses. The bill provides
  8 24 that a vehicle operated by a person in violation of Code
  8 25 section 321.218 may be immediately impounded.
  8 26    Under the bill, the owner of an impounded motor vehicle
  8 27 who knows of, should have known of, or gives consent to the
  8 28 operation of the vehicle in violation of Code section 321.218
  8 29 is guilty of a simple misdemeanor and jointly and severally
  8 30 liable for any damages caused by the person who operated the
  8 31 vehicle. A simple misdemeanor is punishable by a fine of at
  8 32 least $65 but not to exceed $625 and imprisonment not to exceed

  9  2 operated the vehicle is not a co=owner, a motor vehicle rental
  9  3 or leasing agency that owns the vehicle, and a person who
  9  4 owns the vehicle and who is charged but not convicted of the
  9  5 violation which resulted in the impoundment.
  9  6    A person shall be entitled to immediate return of the vehicle
  9  7 after payment of costs associated with the impoundment if
  9  8 the person is an owner of the vehicle, the person's criminal
  9  9 charge that resulted in the impoundment is pending, and the
  9 10 period of impoundment that would be required if the person was
  9 11 convicted of the offense has expired. A person who paid the
  9 12 costs associated with the impoundment shall be reimbursed by
  9 13 the person or agency who received the payment if the person is
  9 14 not convicted of the violation.
  9 15    The bill provides that a court may order the continued
  9 16 impoundment of the vehicle if the convicted person is the owner
  9 17 of the vehicle and the required period of impoundment has not
  9 18 expired. The period of impoundment of a vehicle under the bill
  9 19 is seven days for a first offense. For a second or subsequent
  9 20 offense, the period of impoundment is double the number of days
  9 21 required for the previous offense. For example, for a third
  9 22 offense, the period is 28 days, and for a fifth offense, the
  9 23 period is 112 days.
  9 24    The bill requires the clerk of the district court to send a

  9 26 the person convicted of the offense, the person or agency
  9 27 responsible for executing the order for impoundment, and any

 10  9 the release of the vehicle or issuing new plates for the
 10 10 vehicle until the period of impoundment has expired and the
 10 11 costs have been paid.
 10 12    The bill provides that the court shall assess to the person,
 10 13 in addition to any other penalty, the amount of any expenses
 10 14 for towing, storage, and any other costs of impounding the

 10 24 be seized and forfeited to the state under Code chapters 809
 10 25 (disposition of seized property) and 809A (forfeiture reform
 10 26 Act).
 10 27    Once the period of impoundment has expired, the owner of
 10 28 the vehicle shall have 30 days to claim the vehicle and pay
 10 29 all charges. If the owner has not claimed the vehicle and

 11  5 owner of an impounded vehicle from selling or transferring the
 11  6 title of the vehicle and from purchasing or registering any

 11  2 the vehicle shall be forfeited to the state under Code chapters
 11  3 809 and 809A.
 11  4    During the period of impoundment, the bill prohibits the
 11  5 owner of an impounded vehicle from selling or transferring the
 11  6 title of the vehicle and from purchasing or registering any
 11  7 other vehicle. A violation of this provision is a serious
 11  8 misdemeanor. However, a court may permit transfer of the title
 11  9 in certain circumstances, and is required to notify the DOT of
 11 10 the title transfer.
 11 11    The bill requires that upon learning the address or phone
 11 12 number of a rental or leasing company which owns an impounded
 11 13 vehicle, the peace officer, county attorney, or attorney
 11 14 general shall immediately contact the company to inform
 11 15 the company that the vehicle is available for return to the
 11 16 company. The holder of a security interest in a vehicle which
 11 17 is impounded or forfeited shall be notified of the impoundment
 11 18 or forfeiture within 72 hours of the seizure of the vehicle and
 11 19 shall have the right to claim the vehicle without payment of
 11 20 any fees or surcharges unless the value of the vehicle exceeds
 11 21 the value of the security interest held by the creditor.
 11 22    The bill provides that certain persons may apply to the
 11 23 court for permission to operate a vehicle which is impounded,
 11 24 including a person other than the person who committed the
 11 25 offense who is not a member of the immediate family of the
 11 26 person who committed the offense but is a joint owner of the
 11 27 vehicle, and a member of the immediate family of the person
 11 28 who committed the offense if the member demonstrates that the
 11 29 vehicle is the only vehicle possessed by the family.
 11 30    The impoundment or forfeiture of a motor vehicle under the
 11 31 bill does not constitute loss of use of a vehicle for purposes
 11 32 of any contract of insurance.

  8 19 privilege has been denied, canceled, suspended, or revoked in
  8 20 violation of Code section 321.218. The impoundment procedures
  8 21 set forth in the bill are similar to those set forth in Code
  8 22 section 321J.4B, which deals with vehicle impoundment related
  8 23 to operating=while=intoxicated offenses. The bill provides
  8 24 that a vehicle operated by a person in violation of Code
  8 25 section 321.218 may be immediately impounded.
  8 26    Under the bill, the owner of an impounded motor vehicle
  8 27 who knows of, should have known of, or gives consent to the
  8 28 operation of the vehicle in violation of Code section 321.218
  8 29 is guilty of a simple misdemeanor and jointly and severally
  8 30 liable for any damages caused by the person who operated the
  8 31 vehicle. A simple misdemeanor is punishable by a fine of at
  8 32 least $65 but not to exceed $625 and imprisonment not to exceed
  8 33 30 days.
  8 34    The bill provides that certain persons are entitled to
  8 35 immediate return of the impounded vehicle without payment of
  9  1 costs, including the owner of the vehicle if the person who
  9  2 operated the vehicle is not a co=owner, a motor vehicle rental
  9  3 or leasing agency that owns the vehicle, and a person who
  9  4 owns the vehicle and who is charged but not convicted of the
  9  5 violation which resulted in the impoundment.
  9  6    A person shall be entitled to immediate return of the vehicle
  9  7 after payment of costs associated with the impoundment if
  9  8 the person is an owner of the vehicle, the person's criminal
  9  9 charge that resulted in the impoundment is pending, and the
  9 10 period of impoundment that would be required if the person was
  9 11 convicted of the offense has expired. A person who paid the
  9 12 costs associated with the impoundment shall be reimbursed by
  9 13 the person or agency who received the payment if the person is
  9 14 not convicted of the violation.
  9 15    The bill provides that a court may order the continued
  9 16 impoundment of the vehicle if the convicted person is the owner
  9 17 of the vehicle and the required period of impoundment has not
  9 18 expired. The period of impoundment of a vehicle under the bill
  9 19 is seven days for a first offense. For a second or subsequent
  9 20 offense, the period of impoundment is double the number of days
  9 21 required for the previous offense. For example, for a third
  9 22 offense, the period is 28 days, and for a fifth offense, the
  9 23 period is 112 days.
  9 24    The bill requires the clerk of the district court to send a
  9 25 copy of the order to the department of transportation (DOT),
  9 26 the person convicted of the offense, the person or agency
  9 27 responsible for executing the order for impoundment, and any
  9 28 holders of any security interests in the vehicle.
  9 29    The bill provides that the person or agency responsible for
  9 30 executing the order shall, upon receipt of the order, promptly
  9 31 locate the vehicle specified in the order, seize the vehicle
  9 32 and the registration plates, arrange for the vehicle to be
  9 33 moved to the place of impoundment, and send or deliver the
  9 34 vehicle's registration plates to the DOT.
  9 35    If the person or agency responsible for impounding the
 10  1 vehicle determines that the costs of impoundment exceed the
 10  2 actual wholesale value of the vehicle, the person or agency
 10  3 may treat the vehicle as an abandoned vehicle and notify the
 10  4 registered owner that the vehicle shall be deemed abandoned and
 10  5 shall be sold if payment of the total cost of impoundment is
 10  6 not received within 21 days.
 10  7    The bill requires the DOT to destroy registration plates
 10  8 received under the bill and prohibits the DOT from authorizing
 10  9 the release of the vehicle or issuing new plates for the
 10 10 vehicle until the period of impoundment has expired and the
 10 11 costs have been paid.
 10 12    The bill provides that the court shall assess to the person,
 10 13 in addition to any other penalty, the amount of any expenses
 10 14 for towing, storage, and any other costs of impounding the
 10 15 vehicle. However, the amount assessed to the person for
 10 16 storage of the vehicle shall not exceed $25 per day.
 10 17    The bill prohibits operating a motor vehicle in violation
 10 18 of an order for impoundment, and provides that a violation is
 10 19 a serious misdemeanor. A serious misdemeanor is punishable
 10 20 by a fine of at least $315 but not more than $1,875, and
 10 21 imprisonment not to exceed one year. In addition, the bill
 10 22 provides that a motor vehicle which is subject to an order
 10 23 for impoundment that is operated on a street or highway shall
 10 24 be seized and forfeited to the state under Code chapters 809
 10 25 (disposition of seized property) and 809A (forfeiture reform
 10 26 Act).
 10 27    Once the period of impoundment has expired, the owner of
 10 28 the vehicle shall have 30 days to claim the vehicle and pay
 10 29 all charges. If the owner has not claimed the vehicle and
 10 30 paid all charges within seven days from the date of expiration
 10 31 of the period, the bill requires the clerk to send written
 10 32 notification to the vehicle owner, at the owner's last known
 10 33 address, notifying the owner of the date of expiration of the
 10 34 period of impoundment and of the period in which the vehicle
 10 35 must be claimed. If the vehicle owner fails to claim the
 11  1 vehicle and pay all charges imposed within the 30=day period,
 11  2 the vehicle shall be forfeited to the state under Code chapters
 11  3 809 and 809A.
 11  4    During the period of impoundment, the bill prohibits the
 11  5 owner of an impounded vehicle from selling or transferring the
 11  6 title of the vehicle and from purchasing or registering any
 11  7 other vehicle. A violation of this provision is a serious
 11  8 misdemeanor. However, a court may permit transfer of the title
 11  9 in certain circumstances, and is required to notify the DOT of
 11 10 the title transfer.
 11 11    The bill requires that upon learning the address or phone
 11 12 number of a rental or leasing company which owns an impounded
 11 13 vehicle, the peace officer, county attorney, or attorney
 11 14 general shall immediately contact the company to inform
 11 15 the company that the vehicle is available for return to the
 11 16 company. The holder of a security interest in a vehicle which
 11 17 is impounded or forfeited shall be notified of the impoundment
 11 18 or forfeiture within 72 hours of the seizure of the vehicle and
 11 19 shall have the right to claim the vehicle without payment of
 11 20 any fees or surcharges unless the value of the vehicle exceeds
 11 21 the value of the security interest held by the creditor.
 11 22    The bill provides that certain persons may apply to the
 11 23 court for permission to operate a vehicle which is impounded,
 11 24 including a person other than the person who committed the
 11 25 offense who is not a member of the immediate family of the
 11 26 person who committed the offense but is a joint owner of the
 11 27 vehicle, and a member of the immediate family of the person
 11 28 who committed the offense if the member demonstrates that the
 11 29 vehicle is the only vehicle possessed by the family.
 11 30    The impoundment or forfeiture of a motor vehicle under the

  8 24 that a vehicle operated by a person in violation of Code
  8 25 section 321.218 may be immediately impounded.
  8 26    Under the bill, the owner of an impounded motor vehicle
  8 27 who knows of, should have known of, or gives consent to the
  8 28 operation of the vehicle in violation of Code section 321.218
  8 29 is guilty of a simple misdemeanor and jointly and severally

  8 31 vehicle. A simple misdemeanor is punishable by a fine of at
  8 32 least $65 but not to exceed $625 and imprisonment not to exceed
  8 33 30 days.
  8 34    The bill provides that certain persons are entitled to
  8 35 immediate return of the impounded vehicle without payment of
  9  1 costs, including the owner of the vehicle if the person who
  9  2 operated the vehicle is not a co=owner, a motor vehicle rental
  9  3 or leasing agency that owns the vehicle, and a person who
  9  4 owns the vehicle and who is charged but not convicted of the
  9  5 violation which resulted in the impoundment.
  9  6    A person shall be entitled to immediate return of the vehicle
  9  7 after payment of costs associated with the impoundment if
  9  8 the person is an owner of the vehicle, the person's criminal
  9  9 charge that resulted in the impoundment is pending, and the
  9 10 period of impoundment that would be required if the person was
  9 11 convicted of the offense has expired. A person who paid the
  9 12 costs associated with the impoundment shall be reimbursed by
  9 13 the person or agency who received the payment if the person is
  9 14 not convicted of the violation.
  9 15    The bill provides that a court may order the continued
  9 16 impoundment of the vehicle if the convicted person is the owner
  9 17 of the vehicle and the required period of impoundment has not
  9 18 expired. The period of impoundment of a vehicle under the bill
  9 19 is seven days for a first offense. For a second or subsequent
  9 20 offense, the period of impoundment is double the number of days
  9 21 required for the previous offense. For example, for a third
  9 22 offense, the period is 28 days, and for a fifth offense, the
  9 23 period is 112 days.
  9 24    The bill requires the clerk of the district court to send a
  9 25 copy of the order to the department of transportation (DOT),
  9 26 the person convicted of the offense, the person or agency
  9 27 responsible for executing the order for impoundment, and any
  9 28 holders of any security interests in the vehicle.
  9 29    The bill provides that the person or agency responsible for

  9 32 and the registration plates, arrange for the vehicle to be

  9 34 vehicle's registration plates to the DOT.
  9 35    If the person or agency responsible for impounding the
 10  1 vehicle determines that the costs of impoundment exceed the
 10  2 actual wholesale value of the vehicle, the person or agency
 10  3 may treat the vehicle as an abandoned vehicle and notify the
 10  4 registered owner that the vehicle shall be deemed abandoned and
 10  5 shall be sold if payment of the total cost of impoundment is
 10  6 not received within 21 days.
 10  7    The bill requires the DOT to destroy registration plates
 10  8 received under the bill and prohibits the DOT from authorizing
 10  9 the release of the vehicle or issuing new plates for the
 10 10 vehicle until the period of impoundment has expired and the
 10 11 costs have been paid.
 10 12    The bill provides that the court shall assess to the person,
 10 13 in addition to any other penalty, the amount of any expenses
 10 14 for towing, storage, and any other costs of impounding the
 10 15 vehicle. However, the amount assessed to the person for
 10 16 storage of the vehicle shall not exceed $25 per day.
 10 17    The bill prohibits operating a motor vehicle in violation
 10 18 of an order for impoundment, and provides that a violation is
 10 19 a serious misdemeanor. A serious misdemeanor is punishable
 10 20 by a fine of at least $315 but not more than $1,875, and
 10 21 imprisonment not to exceed one year. In addition, the bill
 10 22 provides that a motor vehicle which is subject to an order
 10 23 for impoundment that is operated on a street or highway shall
 10 24 be seized and forfeited to the state under Code chapters 809
 10 25 (disposition of seized property) and 809A (forfeiture reform
 10 26 Act).
 10 27    Once the period of impoundment has expired, the owner of
 10 28 the vehicle shall have 30 days to claim the vehicle and pay
 10 29 all charges. If the owner has not claimed the vehicle and
 10 30 paid all charges within seven days from the date of expiration
 10 31 of the period, the bill requires the clerk to send written
 10 32 notification to the vehicle owner, at the owner's last known

 11  5 owner of an impounded vehicle from selling or transferring the
 11  6 title of the vehicle and from purchasing or registering any
 11  7 other vehicle. A violation of this provision is a serious
 11  8 misdemeanor. However, a court may permit transfer of the title
 11  9 in certain circumstances, and is required to notify the DOT of
 11 10 the title transfer.
 11 11    The bill requires that upon learning the address or phone
 11 12 number of a rental or leasing company which owns an impounded
 11 13 vehicle, the peace officer, county attorney, or attorney
 11 14 general shall immediately contact the company to inform

  9 21 required for the previous offense. For example, for a third
  9 22 offense, the period is 28 days, and for a fifth offense, the
  9 23 period is 112 days.
  9 24    The bill requires the clerk of the district court to send a

  9 26 the person convicted of the offense, the person or agency
  9 27 responsible for executing the order for impoundment, and any

 10 12    The bill provides that the court shall assess to the person,
 10 13 in addition to any other penalty, the amount of any expenses

 10 16 storage of the vehicle shall not exceed $25 per day.
 10 17    The bill prohibits operating a motor vehicle in violation
 10 18 of an order for impoundment, and provides that a violation is
 10 19 a serious misdemeanor. A serious misdemeanor is punishable
 10 20 by a fine of at least $315 but not more than $1,875, and
 10 21 imprisonment not to exceed one year. In addition, the bill
 10 22 provides that a motor vehicle which is subject to an order

  9  7 after payment of costs associated with the impoundment if
  9  8 the person is an owner of the vehicle, the person's criminal
  9  9 charge that resulted in the impoundment is pending, and the
  9 10 period of impoundment that would be required if the person was
  9 11 convicted of the offense has expired. A person who paid the
  9 12 costs associated with the impoundment shall be reimbursed by
  9 13 the person or agency who received the payment if the person is
  9 14 not convicted of the violation.
  9 15    The bill provides that a court may order the continued
  9 16 impoundment of the vehicle if the convicted person is the owner
  9 17 of the vehicle and the required period of impoundment has not
  9 18 expired. The period of impoundment of a vehicle under the bill
  9 19 is seven days for a first offense. For a second or subsequent
  9 20 offense, the period of impoundment is double the number of days
  9 21 required for the previous offense. For example, for a third
  9 22 offense, the period is 28 days, and for a fifth offense, the
  9 23 period is 112 days.
  9 24    The bill requires the clerk of the district court to send a
  9 25 copy of the order to the department of transportation (DOT),
  9 26 the person convicted of the offense, the person or agency
  9 27 responsible for executing the order for impoundment, and any
  9 28 holders of any security interests in the vehicle.
  9 29    The bill provides that the person or agency responsible for
  9 30 executing the order shall, upon receipt of the order, promptly
  9 31 locate the vehicle specified in the order, seize the vehicle
  9 32 and the registration plates, arrange for the vehicle to be
  9 33 moved to the place of impoundment, and send or deliver the
  9 34 vehicle's registration plates to the DOT.
  9 35    If the person or agency responsible for impounding the
 10  1 vehicle determines that the costs of impoundment exceed the
 10  2 actual wholesale value of the vehicle, the person or agency
 10  3 may treat the vehicle as an abandoned vehicle and notify the
 10  4 registered owner that the vehicle shall be deemed abandoned and
 10  5 shall be sold if payment of the total cost of impoundment is
 10  6 not received within 21 days.
 10  7    The bill requires the DOT to destroy registration plates
 10  8 received under the bill and prohibits the DOT from authorizing
 10  9 the release of the vehicle or issuing new plates for the
 10 10 vehicle until the period of impoundment has expired and the
 10 11 costs have been paid.
 10 12    The bill provides that the court shall assess to the person,
 10 13 in addition to any other penalty, the amount of any expenses
 10 14 for towing, storage, and any other costs of impounding the
 10 15 vehicle. However, the amount assessed to the person for
 10 16 storage of the vehicle shall not exceed $25 per day.
 10 17    The bill prohibits operating a motor vehicle in violation
 10 18 of an order for impoundment, and provides that a violation is
 10 19 a serious misdemeanor. A serious misdemeanor is punishable
 10 20 by a fine of at least $315 but not more than $1,875, and
 10 21 imprisonment not to exceed one year. In addition, the bill
 10 22 provides that a motor vehicle which is subject to an order
 10 23 for impoundment that is operated on a street or highway shall
 10 24 be seized and forfeited to the state under Code chapters 809
 10 25 (disposition of seized property) and 809A (forfeiture reform
 10 26 Act).
 10 27    Once the period of impoundment has expired, the owner of
 10 28 the vehicle shall have 30 days to claim the vehicle and pay
 10 29 all charges. If the owner has not claimed the vehicle and
 10 30 paid all charges within seven days from the date of expiration
 10 31 of the period, the bill requires the clerk to send written
 10 32 notification to the vehicle owner, at the owner's last known
 10 33 address, notifying the owner of the date of expiration of the
 10 34 period of impoundment and of the period in which the vehicle
 10 35 must be claimed. If the vehicle owner fails to claim the
 11  1 vehicle and pay all charges imposed within the 30=day period,
 11  2 the vehicle shall be forfeited to the state under Code chapters
 11  3 809 and 809A.
 11  4    During the period of impoundment, the bill prohibits the
 11  5 owner of an impounded vehicle from selling or transferring the
 11  6 title of the vehicle and from purchasing or registering any
 11  7 other vehicle. A violation of this provision is a serious
 11  8 misdemeanor. However, a court may permit transfer of the title
 11  9 in certain circumstances, and is required to notify the DOT of
 11 10 the title transfer.
 11 11    The bill requires that upon learning the address or phone
 11 12 number of a rental or leasing company which owns an impounded
 11 13 vehicle, the peace officer, county attorney, or attorney
 11 14 general shall immediately contact the company to inform
 11 15 the company that the vehicle is available for return to the
 11 16 company. The holder of a security interest in a vehicle which
 11 17 is impounded or forfeited shall be notified of the impoundment
 11 18 or forfeiture within 72 hours of the seizure of the vehicle and
 11 19 shall have the right to claim the vehicle without payment of
 11 20 any fees or surcharges unless the value of the vehicle exceeds
 11 21 the value of the security interest held by the creditor.
 11 22    The bill provides that certain persons may apply to the
 11 23 court for permission to operate a vehicle which is impounded,
 11 24 including a person other than the person who committed the
 11 25 offense who is not a member of the immediate family of the
 11 26 person who committed the offense but is a joint owner of the
 11 27 vehicle, and a member of the immediate family of the person
 11 28 who committed the offense if the member demonstrates that the
 11 29 vehicle is the only vehicle possessed by the family.
 11 30    The impoundment or forfeiture of a motor vehicle under the
 11 31 bill does not constitute loss of use of a vehicle for purposes
 11 32 of any contract of insurance.

  8 27 who knows of, should have known of, or gives consent to the
  8 28 operation of the vehicle in violation of Code section 321.218
  8 29 is guilty of a simple misdemeanor and jointly and severally
  8 30 liable for any damages caused by the person who operated the
  8 31 vehicle. A simple misdemeanor is punishable by a fine of at
  8 32 least $65 but not to exceed $625 and imprisonment not to exceed
  8 33 30 days.
  8 34    The bill provides that certain persons are entitled to
  8 35 immediate return of the impounded vehicle without payment of
  9  1 costs, including the owner of the vehicle if the person who
  9  2 operated the vehicle is not a co=owner, a motor vehicle rental
  9  3 or leasing agency that owns the vehicle, and a person who
  9  4 owns the vehicle and who is charged but not convicted of the
  9  5 violation which resulted in the impoundment.
  9  6    A person shall be entitled to immediate return of the vehicle
  9  7 after payment of costs associated with the impoundment if
  9  8 the person is an owner of the vehicle, the person's criminal
  9  9 charge that resulted in the impoundment is pending, and the
  9 10 period of impoundment that would be required if the person was
  9 11 convicted of the offense has expired. A person who paid the
  9 12 costs associated with the impoundment shall be reimbursed by
  9 13 the person or agency who received the payment if the person is
  9 14 not convicted of the violation.
  9 15    The bill provides that a court may order the continued
  9 16 impoundment of the vehicle if the convicted person is the owner
  9 17 of the vehicle and the required period of impoundment has not
  9 18 expired. The period of impoundment of a vehicle under the bill
  9 19 is seven days for a first offense. For a second or subsequent
  9 20 offense, the period of impoundment is double the number of days
  9 21 required for the previous offense. For example, for a third
  9 22 offense, the period is 28 days, and for a fifth offense, the
  9 23 period is 112 days.
  9 24    The bill requires the clerk of the district court to send a
  9 25 copy of the order to the department of transportation (DOT),
  9 26 the person convicted of the offense, the person or agency
  9 27 responsible for executing the order for impoundment, and any

 10  2 actual wholesale value of the vehicle, the person or agency
 10  3 may treat the vehicle as an abandoned vehicle and notify the
 10  4 registered owner that the vehicle shall be deemed abandoned and
 10  5 shall be sold if payment of the total cost of impoundment is
 10  6 not received within 21 days.
 10  7    The bill requires the DOT to destroy registration plates
 10  8 received under the bill and prohibits the DOT from authorizing

 10 12    The bill provides that the court shall assess to the person,
 10 13 in addition to any other penalty, the amount of any expenses
 10 14 for towing, storage, and any other costs of impounding the
 10 15 vehicle. However, the amount assessed to the person for
 10 16 storage of the vehicle shall not exceed $25 per day.
 10 17    The bill prohibits operating a motor vehicle in violation
 10 18 of an order for impoundment, and provides that a violation is
 10 19 a serious misdemeanor. A serious misdemeanor is punishable
 10 20 by a fine of at least $315 but not more than $1,875, and
 10 21 imprisonment not to exceed one year. In addition, the bill
 10 22 provides that a motor vehicle which is subject to an order
 10 23 for impoundment that is operated on a street or highway shall
 10 24 be seized and forfeited to the state under Code chapters 809
 10 25 (disposition of seized property) and 809A (forfeiture reform
 10 26 Act).
 10 27    Once the period of impoundment has expired, the owner of
 10 28 the vehicle shall have 30 days to claim the vehicle and pay
 10 29 all charges. If the owner has not claimed the vehicle and
 10 30 paid all charges within seven days from the date of expiration
 10 31 of the period, the bill requires the clerk to send written
 10 32 notification to the vehicle owner, at the owner's last known
 10 33 address, notifying the owner of the date of expiration of the
 10 34 period of impoundment and of the period in which the vehicle
 10 35 must be claimed. If the vehicle owner fails to claim the
 11  1 vehicle and pay all charges imposed within the 30=day period,
 11  2 the vehicle shall be forfeited to the state under Code chapters
 11  3 809 and 809A.
 11  4    During the period of impoundment, the bill prohibits the
 11  5 owner of an impounded vehicle from selling or transferring the
 11  6 title of the vehicle and from purchasing or registering any
 11  7 other vehicle. A violation of this provision is a serious
 11  8 misdemeanor. However, a court may permit transfer of the title
 11  9 in certain circumstances, and is required to notify the DOT of
 11 10 the title transfer.
 11 11    The bill requires that upon learning the address or phone
 11 12 number of a rental or leasing company which owns an impounded
 11 13 vehicle, the peace officer, county attorney, or attorney
 11 14 general shall immediately contact the company to inform

 11 18 or forfeiture within 72 hours of the seizure of the vehicle and
 11 19 shall have the right to claim the vehicle without payment of
 11 20 any fees or surcharges unless the value of the vehicle exceeds
 11 21 the value of the security interest held by the creditor.
 11 22    The bill provides that certain persons may apply to the

 11  4    During the period of impoundment, the bill prohibits the
 11  5 owner of an impounded vehicle from selling or transferring the
 11  6 title of the vehicle and from purchasing or registering any
 11  7 other vehicle. A violation of this provision is a serious
 11  8 misdemeanor. However, a court may permit transfer of the title
 11  9 in certain circumstances, and is required to notify the DOT of
 11 10 the title transfer.
 11 11    The bill requires that upon learning the address or phone
 11 12 number of a rental or leasing company which owns an impounded
 11 13 vehicle, the peace officer, county attorney, or attorney
 11 14 general shall immediately contact the company to inform
 11 15 the company that the vehicle is available for return to the
 11 16 company. The holder of a security interest in a vehicle which
 11 17 is impounded or forfeited shall be notified of the impoundment
 11 18 or forfeiture within 72 hours of the seizure of the vehicle and
 11 19 shall have the right to claim the vehicle without payment of
 11 20 any fees or surcharges unless the value of the vehicle exceeds
 11 21 the value of the security interest held by the creditor.
 11 22    The bill provides that certain persons may apply to the
 11 23 court for permission to operate a vehicle which is impounded,
 11 24 including a person other than the person who committed the
 11 25 offense who is not a member of the immediate family of the
 11 26 person who committed the offense but is a joint owner of the
 11 27 vehicle, and a member of the immediate family of the person
 11 28 who committed the offense if the member demonstrates that the
 11 29 vehicle is the only vehicle possessed by the family.

  8 26    Under the bill, the owner of an impounded motor vehicle
  8 27 who knows of, should have known of, or gives consent to the
  8 28 operation of the vehicle in violation of Code section 321.218
  8 29 is guilty of a simple misdemeanor and jointly and severally
  8 30 liable for any damages caused by the person who operated the
  8 31 vehicle. A simple misdemeanor is punishable by a fine of at
  8 32 least $65 but not to exceed $625 and imprisonment not to exceed
  8 33 30 days.
  8 34    The bill provides that certain persons are entitled to
  8 35 immediate return of the impounded vehicle without payment of
  9  1 costs, including the owner of the vehicle if the person who
  9  2 operated the vehicle is not a co=owner, a motor vehicle rental
  9  3 or leasing agency that owns the vehicle, and a person who
  9  4 owns the vehicle and who is charged but not convicted of the
  9  5 violation which resulted in the impoundment.
  9  6    A person shall be entitled to immediate return of the vehicle
  9  7 after payment of costs associated with the impoundment if
  9  8 the person is an owner of the vehicle, the person's criminal
  9  9 charge that resulted in the impoundment is pending, and the
  9 10 period of impoundment that would be required if the person was
  9 11 convicted of the offense has expired. A person who paid the
  9 12 costs associated with the impoundment shall be reimbursed by
  9 13 the person or agency who received the payment if the person is
  9 14 not convicted of the violation.
  9 15    The bill provides that a court may order the continued
  9 16 impoundment of the vehicle if the convicted person is the owner
  9 17 of the vehicle and the required period of impoundment has not
  9 18 expired. The period of impoundment of a vehicle under the bill
  9 19 is seven days for a first offense. For a second or subsequent
  9 20 offense, the period of impoundment is double the number of days
  9 21 required for the previous offense. For example, for a third
  9 22 offense, the period is 28 days, and for a fifth offense, the
  9 23 period is 112 days.
  9 24    The bill requires the clerk of the district court to send a
  9 25 copy of the order to the department of transportation (DOT),
  9 26 the person convicted of the offense, the person or agency
  9 27 responsible for executing the order for impoundment, and any
  9 28 holders of any security interests in the vehicle.
  9 29    The bill provides that the person or agency responsible for
  9 30 executing the order shall, upon receipt of the order, promptly
  9 31 locate the vehicle specified in the order, seize the vehicle
  9 32 and the registration plates, arrange for the vehicle to be
  9 33 moved to the place of impoundment, and send or deliver the
  9 34 vehicle's registration plates to the DOT.
  9 35    If the person or agency responsible for impounding the
 10  1 vehicle determines that the costs of impoundment exceed the
 10  2 actual wholesale value of the vehicle, the person or agency
 10  3 may treat the vehicle as an abandoned vehicle and notify the
 10  4 registered owner that the vehicle shall be deemed abandoned and
 10  5 shall be sold if payment of the total cost of impoundment is
 10  6 not received within 21 days.
 10  7    The bill requires the DOT to destroy registration plates
 10  8 received under the bill and prohibits the DOT from authorizing
 10  9 the release of the vehicle or issuing new plates for the
 10 10 vehicle until the period of impoundment has expired and the
 10 11 costs have been paid.
 10 12    The bill provides that the court shall assess to the person,
 10 13 in addition to any other penalty, the amount of any expenses
 10 14 for towing, storage, and any other costs of impounding the
 10 15 vehicle. However, the amount assessed to the person for
 10 16 storage of the vehicle shall not exceed $25 per day.
 10 17    The bill prohibits operating a motor vehicle in violation
 10 18 of an order for impoundment, and provides that a violation is
 10 19 a serious misdemeanor. A serious misdemeanor is punishable
 10 20 by a fine of at least $315 but not more than $1,875, and
 10 21 imprisonment not to exceed one year. In addition, the bill
 10 22 provides that a motor vehicle which is subject to an order
 10 23 for impoundment that is operated on a street or highway shall
 10 24 be seized and forfeited to the state under Code chapters 809
 10 25 (disposition of seized property) and 809A (forfeiture reform
 10 26 Act).
 10 27    Once the period of impoundment has expired, the owner of
 10 28 the vehicle shall have 30 days to claim the vehicle and pay
 10 29 all charges. If the owner has not claimed the vehicle and
 10 30 paid all charges within seven days from the date of expiration
 10 31 of the period, the bill requires the clerk to send written
 10 32 notification to the vehicle owner, at the owner's last known
 10 33 address, notifying the owner of the date of expiration of the
 10 34 period of impoundment and of the period in which the vehicle
 10 35 must be claimed. If the vehicle owner fails to claim the
 11  1 vehicle and pay all charges imposed within the 30=day period,
 11  2 the vehicle shall be forfeited to the state under Code chapters
 11  3 809 and 809A.
 11  4    During the period of impoundment, the bill prohibits the
 11  5 owner of an impounded vehicle from selling or transferring the
 11  6 title of the vehicle and from purchasing or registering any
 11  7 other vehicle. A violation of this provision is a serious
 11  8 misdemeanor. However, a court may permit transfer of the title
 11  9 in certain circumstances, and is required to notify the DOT of
 11 10 the title transfer.

 11 12 number of a rental or leasing company which owns an impounded
 11 13 vehicle, the peace officer, county attorney, or attorney
 11 14 general shall immediately contact the company to inform

 11 17 is impounded or forfeited shall be notified of the impoundment
 11 18 or forfeiture within 72 hours of the seizure of the vehicle and
 11 19 shall have the right to claim the vehicle without payment of
 11 20 any fees or surcharges unless the value of the vehicle exceeds
 11 21 the value of the security interest held by the creditor.
 11 22    The bill provides that certain persons may apply to the

 10 12    The bill provides that the court shall assess to the person,
 10 13 in addition to any other penalty, the amount of any expenses
 10 14 for towing, storage, and any other costs of impounding the

 10 16 storage of the vehicle shall not exceed $25 per day.
 10 17    The bill prohibits operating a motor vehicle in violation
 10 18 of an order for impoundment, and provides that a violation is
 10 19 a serious misdemeanor. A serious misdemeanor is punishable

 10 31 of the period, the bill requires the clerk to send written
 10 32 notification to the vehicle owner, at the owner's last known
 10 33 address, notifying the owner of the date of expiration of the
 10 34 period of impoundment and of the period in which the vehicle

 11  2 the vehicle shall be forfeited to the state under Code chapters
 11  3 809 and 809A.
 11  4    During the period of impoundment, the bill prohibits the
 11  5 owner of an impounded vehicle from selling or transferring the
 11  6 title of the vehicle and from purchasing or registering any
 11  7 other vehicle. A violation of this provision is a serious
 11  8 misdemeanor. However, a court may permit transfer of the title
 11  9 in certain circumstances, and is required to notify the DOT of
 11 10 the title transfer.
 11 11    The bill requires that upon learning the address or phone
 11 12 number of a rental or leasing company which owns an impounded
 11 13 vehicle, the peace officer, county attorney, or attorney
 11 14 general shall immediately contact the company to inform
 11 15 the company that the vehicle is available for return to the

 11 18 or forfeiture within 72 hours of the seizure of the vehicle and
 11 19 shall have the right to claim the vehicle without payment of

  9  3 or leasing agency that owns the vehicle, and a person who
  9  4 owns the vehicle and who is charged but not convicted of the
  9  5 violation which resulted in the impoundment.

  9  7 after payment of costs associated with the impoundment if
  9  8 the person is an owner of the vehicle, the person's criminal
  9  9 charge that resulted in the impoundment is pending, and the
  9 10 period of impoundment that would be required if the person was
  9 11 convicted of the offense has expired. A person who paid the
  9 12 costs associated with the impoundment shall be reimbursed by
  9 13 the person or agency who received the payment if the person is
  9 14 not convicted of the violation.
  9 15    The bill provides that a court may order the continued
  9 16 impoundment of the vehicle if the convicted person is the owner
  9 17 of the vehicle and the required period of impoundment has not
  9 18 expired. The period of impoundment of a vehicle under the bill
  9 19 is seven days for a first offense. For a second or subsequent
  9 20 offense, the period of impoundment is double the number of days
  9 21 required for the previous offense. For example, for a third
  9 22 offense, the period is 28 days, and for a fifth offense, the
  9 23 period is 112 days.
  9 24    The bill requires the clerk of the district court to send a

  9 26 the person convicted of the offense, the person or agency
  9 27 responsible for executing the order for impoundment, and any

  9 33 moved to the place of impoundment, and send or deliver the
  9 34 vehicle's registration plates to the DOT.
  9 35    If the person or agency responsible for impounding the
 10  1 vehicle determines that the costs of impoundment exceed the
 10  2 actual wholesale value of the vehicle, the person or agency
 10  3 may treat the vehicle as an abandoned vehicle and notify the
 10  4 registered owner that the vehicle shall be deemed abandoned and
 10  5 shall be sold if payment of the total cost of impoundment is
 10  6 not received within 21 days.
 10  7    The bill requires the DOT to destroy registration plates

 10 12    The bill provides that the court shall assess to the person,
 10 13 in addition to any other penalty, the amount of any expenses

 10 16 storage of the vehicle shall not exceed $25 per day.
 10 17    The bill prohibits operating a motor vehicle in violation
 10 18 of an order for impoundment, and provides that a violation is

 11 18 or forfeiture within 72 hours of the seizure of the vehicle and
 11 19 shall have the right to claim the vehicle without payment of

 10  3 may treat the vehicle as an abandoned vehicle and notify the
 10  4 registered owner that the vehicle shall be deemed abandoned and

 10  6 not received within 21 days.
 10  7    The bill requires the DOT to destroy registration plates

 10 31 of the period, the bill requires the clerk to send written
 10 32 notification to the vehicle owner, at the owner's last known
 10 33 address, notifying the owner of the date of expiration of the

 11  2 the vehicle shall be forfeited to the state under Code chapters
 11  3 809 and 809A.

 11 18 or forfeiture within 72 hours of the seizure of the vehicle and
 11 19 shall have the right to claim the vehicle without payment of
 11 20 any fees or surcharges unless the value of the vehicle exceeds
 11 21 the value of the security interest held by the creditor.
 11 22    The bill provides that certain persons may apply to the
 11 23 court for permission to operate a vehicle which is impounded,

  9 35    If the person or agency responsible for impounding the
 10  1 vehicle determines that the costs of impoundment exceed the
 10  2 actual wholesale value of the vehicle, the person or agency
 10  3 may treat the vehicle as an abandoned vehicle and notify the
 10  4 registered owner that the vehicle shall be deemed abandoned and
 10  5 shall be sold if payment of the total cost of impoundment is
 10  6 not received within 21 days.
 10  7    The bill requires the DOT to destroy registration plates
 10  8 received under the bill and prohibits the DOT from authorizing
 10  9 the release of the vehicle or issuing new plates for the
 10 10 vehicle until the period of impoundment has expired and the
 10 11 costs have been paid.
 10 12    The bill provides that the court shall assess to the person,
 10 13 in addition to any other penalty, the amount of any expenses
 10 14 for towing, storage, and any other costs of impounding the

 10 21 imprisonment not to exceed one year. In addition, the bill
 10 22 provides that a motor vehicle which is subject to an order
 10 23 for impoundment that is operated on a street or highway shall
 10 24 be seized and forfeited to the state under Code chapters 809
 10 25 (disposition of seized property) and 809A (forfeiture reform
 10 26 Act).
 10 27    Once the period of impoundment has expired, the owner of
 10 28 the vehicle shall have 30 days to claim the vehicle and pay

 10 30 paid all charges within seven days from the date of expiration
 10 31 of the period, the bill requires the clerk to send written
 10 32 notification to the vehicle owner, at the owner's last known
 10 33 address, notifying the owner of the date of expiration of the
 10 34 period of impoundment and of the period in which the vehicle
 10 35 must be claimed. If the vehicle owner fails to claim the
 11  1 vehicle and pay all charges imposed within the 30=day period,
 11  2 the vehicle shall be forfeited to the state under Code chapters
 11  3 809 and 809A.
 11  4    During the period of impoundment, the bill prohibits the
 11  5 owner of an impounded vehicle from selling or transferring the
 11  6 title of the vehicle and from purchasing or registering any
 11  7 other vehicle. A violation of this provision is a serious
 11  8 misdemeanor. However, a court may permit transfer of the title
 11  9 in certain circumstances, and is required to notify the DOT of
 11 10 the title transfer.
 11 11    The bill requires that upon learning the address or phone
 11 12 number of a rental or leasing company which owns an impounded
 11 13 vehicle, the peace officer, county attorney, or attorney
 11 14 general shall immediately contact the company to inform
 11 15 the company that the vehicle is available for return to the
 11 16 company. The holder of a security interest in a vehicle which
 11 17 is impounded or forfeited shall be notified of the impoundment
 11 18 or forfeiture within 72 hours of the seizure of the vehicle and
 11 19 shall have the right to claim the vehicle without payment of
 11 20 any fees or surcharges unless the value of the vehicle exceeds
 11 21 the value of the security interest held by the creditor.
 11 22    The bill provides that certain persons may apply to the
 11 23 court for permission to operate a vehicle which is impounded,
 11 24 including a person other than the person who committed the
 11 25 offense who is not a member of the immediate family of the
 11 26 person who committed the offense but is a joint owner of the
 11 27 vehicle, and a member of the immediate family of the person
 11 28 who committed the offense if the member demonstrates that the
 11 29 vehicle is the only vehicle possessed by the family.

 10 29 all charges. If the owner has not claimed the vehicle and
 10 30 paid all charges within seven days from the date of expiration
 10 31 of the period, the bill requires the clerk to send written
 10 32 notification to the vehicle owner, at the owner's last known
 10 33 address, notifying the owner of the date of expiration of the
 10 34 period of impoundment and of the period in which the vehicle
 10 35 must be claimed. If the vehicle owner fails to claim the

 11  2 the vehicle shall be forfeited to the state under Code chapters
 11  3 809 and 809A.
 11  4    During the period of impoundment, the bill prohibits the
 11  5 owner of an impounded vehicle from selling or transferring the
 11  6 title of the vehicle and from purchasing or registering any
 11  7 other vehicle. A violation of this provision is a serious
 11  8 misdemeanor. However, a court may permit transfer of the title
 11  9 in certain circumstances, and is required to notify the DOT of
 11 10 the title transfer.
 11 11    The bill requires that upon learning the address or phone
 11 12 number of a rental or leasing company which owns an impounded
 11 13 vehicle, the peace officer, county attorney, or attorney
 11 14 general shall immediately contact the company to inform
 11 15 the company that the vehicle is available for return to the
 11 16 company. The holder of a security interest in a vehicle which
 11 17 is impounded or forfeited shall be notified of the impoundment
 11 18 or forfeiture within 72 hours of the seizure of the vehicle and
 11 19 shall have the right to claim the vehicle without payment of
 11 20 any fees or surcharges unless the value of the vehicle exceeds
 11 21 the value of the security interest held by the creditor.
 11 22    The bill provides that certain persons may apply to the

 11 26 person who committed the offense but is a joint owner of the
 11 27 vehicle, and a member of the immediate family of the person
 11 28 who committed the offense if the member demonstrates that the
 11 29 vehicle is the only vehicle possessed by the family.

  9 12 costs associated with the impoundment shall be reimbursed by
  9 13 the person or agency who received the payment if the person is
  9 14 not convicted of the violation.
  9 15    The bill provides that a court may order the continued
  9 16 impoundment of the vehicle if the convicted person is the owner
  9 17 of the vehicle and the required period of impoundment has not
  9 18 expired. The period of impoundment of a vehicle under the bill
  9 19 is seven days for a first offense. For a second or subsequent
  9 20 offense, the period of impoundment is double the number of days
  9 21 required for the previous offense. For example, for a third
  9 22 offense, the period is 28 days, and for a fifth offense, the
  9 23 period is 112 days.
  9 24    The bill requires the clerk of the district court to send a

  9 27 responsible for executing the order for impoundment, and any
  9 28 holders of any security interests in the vehicle.
  9 29    The bill provides that the person or agency responsible for
  9 30 executing the order shall, upon receipt of the order, promptly
  9 31 locate the vehicle specified in the order, seize the vehicle
  9 32 and the registration plates, arrange for the vehicle to be
  9 33 moved to the place of impoundment, and send or deliver the
  9 34 vehicle's registration plates to the DOT.
  9 35    If the person or agency responsible for impounding the
 10  1 vehicle determines that the costs of impoundment exceed the
 10  2 actual wholesale value of the vehicle, the person or agency
 10  3 may treat the vehicle as an abandoned vehicle and notify the
 10  4 registered owner that the vehicle shall be deemed abandoned and
 10  5 shall be sold if payment of the total cost of impoundment is
 10  6 not received within 21 days.
 10  7    The bill requires the DOT to destroy registration plates

 10 11 costs have been paid.
 10 12    The bill provides that the court shall assess to the person,
 10 13 in addition to any other penalty, the amount of any expenses
 10 14 for towing, storage, and any other costs of impounding the
 10 15 vehicle. However, the amount assessed to the person for
 10 16 storage of the vehicle shall not exceed $25 per day.
 10 17    The bill prohibits operating a motor vehicle in violation
 10 18 of an order for impoundment, and provides that a violation is

 10 20 by a fine of at least $315 but not more than $1,875, and
 10 21 imprisonment not to exceed one year. In addition, the bill
 10 22 provides that a motor vehicle which is subject to an order
 10 23 for impoundment that is operated on a street or highway shall
 10 24 be seized and forfeited to the state under Code chapters 809

 11 17 is impounded or forfeited shall be notified of the impoundment
 11 18 or forfeiture within 72 hours of the seizure of the vehicle and
 11 19 shall have the right to claim the vehicle without payment of
