  4 10    This bill relates to the activities of motor vehicle dealers

  4 15 10 model years old which is equipped with an odometer by the
  4 16 manufacturer unless an odometer statement has been made by the
  4 17 transferor of the vehicle. The bill expands this provision

  4 19 violation of this provision is a fraudulent practice.
  4 20    Current law provides that it is a simple misdemeanor
  4 21 punishable by a $100 fine to sell, offer for sale, or transfer
  4 22 a motor vehicle without obtaining a certificate of title in the

  4 29 these provisions into two subsections.
  4 30    The bill alters the definition of "engaged in the business"
  4 31 to include advertising as being engaged in acquiring, selling,
  4 32 exchanging, holding, offering, displaying, brokering, accepting
  4 33 on consignment, or conducting a retail auction of motor
  4 34 vehicles for the purpose of sale at retail. The bill also
  4 35 defines "salesperson" as a person employed by a motor vehicle
  5  1 dealer for the purpose of selling motor vehicles.
  5  2    The bill provides that a person licensed as a motor vehicle
  5  3 dealer or wholesaler shall not sell, loan, rent, lease, or
  5  4 charge a fee for the use of such license to another person for
  5  5 the purpose of allowing that person to sell a motor vehicle for
  5  6 financial gain. A violation of this provision shall result in
  5  7 the revocation of such license in addition to the penalties set
  5  8 forth in Code section 322.14.
  5  9    Current law requires two partners of a partnership and two
  5 10 officers of a corporation to be named on a motor vehicle dealer
  5 11 license application. The bill requires all partners of a
  5 12 partnership and all officers of corporation to be named on a
  5 13 motor vehicle dealer license application.
  5 14    The bill provides that a motor vehicle dealer who takes
  5 15 possession of a motor vehicle from a retail buyer for the
  5 16 purpose of resale upon which there is an outstanding lien
  5 17 or encumbrance shall tender full payment on the outstanding
  5 18 lien or encumbrance within 10 business days after the motor
  5 19 vehicle dealer takes possession of the motor vehicle from the
  5 20 retail buyer, provided the retail installment contract has been
  5 21 executed by the retail buyer and the dealer.
  5 22    The bill further provides that advertising by a motor
  5 23 vehicle dealer shall include the dealership's name, address,
  5 24 and landline telephone number, and may include the dealership's
  5 25 cellular telephone number, if applicable.
  5 26    Under Code section 322.14, a person who violates any of
  5 27 the provisions of Code chapter 322 for which a penalty is
  5 28 not specifically provided is guilty of a simple misdemeanor
  5 29 punishable by a fine of not less than $250 nor more than
  5 30 $1,500, or by imprisonment not to exceed 30 days.
  5 31    For purposes of Code chapter 322C relating to travel trailer
  5 32 dealers, manufacturers, and distributors, the bill defines
  5 33 "salesperson" as a person employed by a travel trailer dealer
