 16 32    Under current law, the authority is allowed to provide
 16 33 financial assistance of up to $25,000 to any single business
 16 34 and is allowed to provide such financial assistance as matching
 16 35 funds to allow a business to qualify for either federal
 17  1 program. The division provides that the authority may provide
 17  2 financial assistance of up to $100,000 to a business for any
 17  3 individual federal award under those programs and that the

 17  5 business to meet federal program requirements.

 17  7 The division allows a city or county and the authority
 17  8 for compliance reasons to amend agreements made under the
 17  9 enterprise zone program as long as the amendments do not

 17 12    Division V of the bill relates to the historic preservation
 17 13 and cultural and entertainment district tax credit by

 17 21 refundable with interest, but, in lieu of a refund, the
 17 22 excess may be credited against tax liability for the following
 17 23 year. The division makes additional changes related to
 17 24 taxpayer notifications, to rehabilitation work standards, and
 17 25 to verification and credit issuance processes. Under the
 17 26 division, the department of cultural affairs is required to
