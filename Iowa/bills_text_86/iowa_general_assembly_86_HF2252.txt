  1 28 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  1 29 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  1 30    Current law requires the state board of education to adopt
  1 31 rules for online learning, including rules prohibiting the
  1 32 open enrollment of students whose educational instruction and
  1 33 course content are delivered primarily over the internet. An
  1 34 exception to that prohibition requires the board to adopt rules
  1 35 allowing such enrollment, with limitations on how many students
  2  1 may be enrolled statewide and per school district. Until June
  2  2 30, 2018, such limitations do not apply to certain students.
  2  3 The exception also limits such open enrollment to the CAM
  2  4 community school district or the Clayton Ridge community school
  2  5 district.
  2  6    This bill repeals the exception to the prohibition on June
  2  7 30, 2018. At that time, open enrollment of students whose
  2  8 educational instruction and course content are delivered
  2  9 primarily over the internet would be entirely prohibited.
  2 10    The bill also strikes language providing that until June
  2 11 30, 2018, limitations on how many students may be enrolled
  2 12 statewide and per school district are not applicable to
  2 13 certain students. The bill removes the date limitation of this
