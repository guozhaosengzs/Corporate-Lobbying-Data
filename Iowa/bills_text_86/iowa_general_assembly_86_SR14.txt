  1 24 states; and
  1 25    WHEREAS, the federal distribution, review, and

  2  5 undertake; and
  2  6    WHEREAS, the United States Congress has expressed
  2  7 a strong interest in reducing the role of the federal
  2  8 government by allowing each state to manage its own
  2  9 affairs; NOW THEREFORE,
  2 10    BE IT RESOLVED BY THE SENATE, That the Senate urges
  2 11 the United States Congress to return to the individual
  2 12 states maximum discretionary authority and fiscal
  2 13 responsibility for all elements of the national surface
  2 14 transportation systems that are not within the direct
