  3 14    This bill establishes a school wind generation revolving
  3 15 loan and grant program within the Iowa energy center, creates
  3 16 a corresponding fund, and makes a $5 million appropriation
  3 17 to the fund for FY 2015=2016.  Moneys in the fund will be
  3 18 used to provide loans and grants to school districts and Iowa
  3 19 community colleges to invest in wind generation projects.
  3 20 "Wind generation project" is defined as the purchase and
  3 21 installation of a wind energy conversion system or systems that
  3 22 in the aggregate will produce electricity which has a nameplate
  3 23 generating capacity not in excess of 100 kilowatts.
  3 24    School districts or Iowa community colleges may apply to the
  3 25 Iowa energy center to receive a grant and loan for the purchase
  3 26 and installation costs of a wind generation project.
  3 27    A grant not to exceed 40 percent of the purchase and
  3 28 installation costs may be provided for that part of a wind
  3 29 generation project that will produce electricity which has a
  3 30 nameplate generating capacity of up to 10 kilowatts.  If the
  3 31 wind generation project will produce electricity which has a
  3 32 nameplate generating capacity of greater than 10 kilowatts,
  3 33 a school district or Iowa community college may receive the
  3 34 grant listed above and a loan not to exceed 40 percent of the
  3 35 remaining purchase and installation costs that are in excess of
  4  1 those established for the grant.
  4  2    Each loan provided in the bill shall be for a period not to
  4  3 exceed 20 years, shall bear no interest, and shall be repayable
  4  4 to the fund in installments determined by the Iowa energy

  4  6 accelerate immediately to the current legal usury limit.  Loans
  4  7 shall become due immediately upon the sale of the wind energy
  4  8 conversion system for which the loan was made.
  4  9    Additionally, the bill adds as one of the authorized uses
  4 10 of physical plant and equipment levy revenues by a school
  4 11 district expenditures for the construction of alternate energy
  4 12 production facilities as defined in Code section 476.42,

  3 12 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  3 13 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  3 14    This bill establishes a school wind generation revolving
  3 15 loan and grant program within the Iowa energy center, creates
  3 16 a corresponding fund, and makes a $5 million appropriation
  3 17 to the fund for FY 2015=2016.  Moneys in the fund will be
  3 18 used to provide loans and grants to school districts and Iowa
  3 19 community colleges to invest in wind generation projects.
  3 20 "Wind generation project" is defined as the purchase and
  3 21 installation of a wind energy conversion system or systems that
  3 22 in the aggregate will produce electricity which has a nameplate
  3 23 generating capacity not in excess of 100 kilowatts.
  3 24    School districts or Iowa community colleges may apply to the
  3 25 Iowa energy center to receive a grant and loan for the purchase
  3 26 and installation costs of a wind generation project.
  3 27    A grant not to exceed 40 percent of the purchase and
  3 28 installation costs may be provided for that part of a wind
  3 29 generation project that will produce electricity which has a
  3 30 nameplate generating capacity of up to 10 kilowatts.  If the

  3 32 nameplate generating capacity of greater than 10 kilowatts,
  3 33 a school district or Iowa community college may receive the
  3 34 grant listed above and a loan not to exceed 40 percent of the
  3 35 remaining purchase and installation costs that are in excess of

  4 10 of physical plant and equipment levy revenues by a school
  4 11 district expenditures for the construction of alternate energy
  4 12 production facilities as defined in Code section 476.42,
