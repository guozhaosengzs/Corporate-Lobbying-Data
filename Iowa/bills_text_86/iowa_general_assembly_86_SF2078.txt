  2 28 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  2 29 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  2 30    This bill relates to insurance coverage for prescription
  2 31 drugs dispensed in a manner to facilitate medication
  2 32 synchronization.  The bill requires that a group policy or
  2 33 contract providing for third=party payment or prepayment for
  2 34 prescription drugs apply a prorated daily cost=sharing rate to
  2 35 prescription drugs that are dispensed for less than a 30=day
  3  1 supply, for the purposes of synchronizing the medications
  3  2 of the person covered under the policy or contract, if the
  3  3 prescriber or pharmacist determines the prorated filling or
  3  4 refilling of the prescription drug to be in the best interest
  3  5 of the person and the person requests or agrees to less than
  3  6 a 30=day supply. However, the group policy or contract shall
  3  7 not use payment structures incorporating pro rata dispensing
  3  8 fees, and the dispensing fee for partially filled or refilled
  3  9 prescriptions shall be paid based on the full supply of each
  3 10 prescription dispensed, regardless of any prorated copayment
  3 11 paid by the covered person for synchronization of medications.
  3 12    The bill also prohibits a group policy or contract providing
  3 13 for third=party payment or prepayment for prescription
  3 14 drugs from denying coverage for the dispensing of multiple
  3 15 prescriptions at one time for the purposes of synchronizing
  3 16 medications for a covered person under the policy or contract,
  3 17 if the person and the pharmacist or other prescriber agree
  3 18 to synchronizing the filling or refilling of multiple
  3 19 prescriptions for the person.  The group policy or contract
  3 20 is required to allow a pharmacy to override any denial codes
  3 21 indicating that a prescription drug is being refilled too soon
  3 22 for the purposes of medication synchronization.
  3 23    The bill requires a person who provides an individual policy
  3 24 or contract providing for third=party payment or prepayment
  3 25 of health or medical expenses to make available a coverage
  3 26 provision that satisfies the requirements of the bill in the
  3 27 same manner as such requirements are applicable to a group
  3 28 policy or contract. The policy or contract shall provide that
  3 29 the individual policyholder may reject the coverage provision
  3 30 at the option of the policyholder.
  3 31    The bill specifies the classes of third=party payment
  3 32 provider contracts or policies delivered, issued for delivery,

  2 35 prescription drugs that are dispensed for less than a 30=day
  3  1 supply, for the purposes of synchronizing the medications
  3  2 of the person covered under the policy or contract, if the

  3  5 of the person and the person requests or agrees to less than
  3  6 a 30=day supply. However, the group policy or contract shall
  3  7 not use payment structures incorporating pro rata dispensing
  3  8 fees, and the dispensing fee for partially filled or refilled
