  3  9    Sec. 10.  EFFECTIVE DATE.  The following provision or
  3 10 provisions of this Act take effect July 1, 2017:
  3 11    1.  The section of this Act amending section 602.1501.
  3 12    2.  The section of this Act repealing 2013 Iowa Acts, chapter

  3 14                           EXPLANATION
  3 15 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  3 16 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  3 17    This bill relates to salaries and apportionment of judicial
  3 18 officers.
  3 19    Currently, the salary for judicial officers is set by the
  3 20 general assembly by session law.  The bill provides that the
  3 21 salaries of judicial officers shall be set by the supreme court
  3 22 and paid from the general operating moneys appropriated to the
  3 23 judicial branch.  This provision takes effect July 1, 2017.
  3 24    Currently, if a vacancy occurs in the office of a district
  3 25 judge, district associate judge, associate juvenile judge,
  3 26 or associate probate judge and the chief justice finds
  3 27 disparity in the allocation of such judicial officers, the
  3 28 chief justice may apportion the vacancy if a majority of the
  3 29 judicial council approves the apportionment.  The bill changes
  3 30 the responsibility of finding disparity and apportioning
  3 31 the vacancy to the supreme court. The bill eliminates the
