  1 11 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  1 12 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  1 13    This bill provides that an application for a hunting,
  1 14 fishing, or fur harvester license shall be "in writing"
  1 15 instead of "in ink".  Code section 4.1(39) provides that use
  1 16 of the words "in writing" in a statute includes any mode of
  1 17 representing words or letters in general use, and includes an
  1 18 electronic record, and use of the word "signature" includes an
  1 19 electronic signature, both as defined in Code section 554D.103.
  1 20    Code section 554D.103 defines an "electronic record" as a
  1 21 record created, generated, sent, communicated, received, or
  1 22 stored by electronic means, and an "electronic signature" as an
  1 23 electronic sound, symbol, or process attached to or logically
  1 24 associated with a record and executed or adopted by a person
