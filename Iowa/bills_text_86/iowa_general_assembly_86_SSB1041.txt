Code

The
bill

comply
with
the
bill.
The
scheduled
fine
for
a
violation
3


of
Code
section
321.276
remains
$30.
Under
current
law,
the

offense
is
not
a

considered

purposes
of
administrative
suspension
of
a
6


driver’s
license
or
to
establish
habitual
offender
status.

causes
a
serious
injury,
a
court

could
impose
an
additional
fine
of
$500
or
suspend
the
person’s
9


driver’s
license
for
not
more
than
90
days,
or
both.
If
the
10


violation
causes
a
death,
a
court
could
impose
an
additional
11


fine
of
$1,000
or
suspend
the
person’s
driver’s
license
for
not
12


more
than
180
days,
or
both.
