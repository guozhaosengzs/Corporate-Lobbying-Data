  2  6 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  2  7 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  2  8    GENERAL.  This bill amends Code chapter 717B, which provides
  2  9 for offenses relating to the mistreatment of animals defined
  2 10 not to include livestock or game (Code section 717B.1). A
  2 11 person who intentionally injures, maims, disfigures, or
  2 12 destroys an animal owned by another person commits animal
  2 13 abuse and is guilty of an aggravated misdemeanor (Code section
  2 14 717B.2).
  2 15    SERVICE DOG ABUSE ==== NEW CRIMINAL OFFENSE.  The bill creates
  2 16 a new criminal offense referred to as service dog abuse. A
  2 17 person commits this offense when such person owns or possesses
  2 18 another dog which attacks a service dog. A service dog is
  2 19 defined as a dog classified as a service animal as provided
  2 20 in regulations adopted by the United States department of
  2 21 justice pursuant to the federal Americans with Disabilities
  2 22 Act.  Under federal law, the dog must be individually
  2 23 trained to do work or perform tasks for the benefit of an
  2 24 individual with a disability, including a physical, sensory,
  2 25 psychiatric, intellectual, or other mental disability. The
  2 26 bill specifically excludes certain circumstances including when
  2 27 the two dogs are owned by the same person, or a service dog was
  2 28 either not under the control of its owner or handler or behaved
  2 29 aggressively.
  2 30    SERVICE DOG ABUSE ==== PENALTIES AND RESTITUTION.  Generally,
  2 31 a person convicted of service dog abuse is guilty of a simple
  2 32 misdemeanor.  However, a person owning or possessing the
  2 33 attacking dog is guilty of a serious misdemeanor if the  service
  2 34 dog was critically injured or killed, or the person has been
  2 35 convicted three or more times in the previous 10 years of an
  3  1 offense under the Code chapter.  A person owning or possessing
  3  2 the attacking dog is guilty of an aggravated misdemeanor if the
  3  3 attack was directly caused by the person's willful, malicious,
  3  4 or reckless act. The person must also pay restitution to the
  3  5 victim for certain expenses incurred by the attack, including
  3  6 for veterinary care or for the replacement of the service dog
  3  7 (see Code chapter 910).
  3  8    CRIMINAL PENALTIES.  A simple misdemeanor is punishable by
  3  9 confinement for no more than 30 days or a fine of at least
  3 10 $65 but not more than $625 or by both.  A serious misdemeanor
  3 11 is punishable by confinement for no more than one year and a
  3 12 fine of at least $315 but not more than $1,875. An aggravated
  3 13 misdemeanor is punishable by confinement for no more than two
  3 14 years and a fine of at least $625 but not more than $6,250.

  2  6 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  2  7 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  2  8    GENERAL.  This bill amends Code chapter 717B, which provides
  2  9 for offenses relating to the mistreatment of animals defined
  2 10 not to include livestock or game (Code section 717B.1). A
  2 11 person who intentionally injures, maims, disfigures, or
  2 12 destroys an animal owned by another person commits animal
  2 13 abuse and is guilty of an aggravated misdemeanor (Code section
  2 14 717B.2).
  2 15    SERVICE DOG ABUSE ==== NEW CRIMINAL OFFENSE.  The bill creates
  2 16 a new criminal offense referred to as service dog abuse. A
  2 17 person commits this offense when such person owns or possesses
  2 18 another dog which attacks a service dog. A service dog is
  2 19 defined as a dog classified as a service animal as provided
  2 20 in regulations adopted by the United States department of
  2 21 justice pursuant to the federal Americans with Disabilities
  2 22 Act.  Under federal law, the dog must be individually
  2 23 trained to do work or perform tasks for the benefit of an
  2 24 individual with a disability, including a physical, sensory,
  2 25 psychiatric, intellectual, or other mental disability. The
  2 26 bill specifically excludes certain circumstances including when
  2 27 the two dogs are owned by the same person, or a service dog was
  2 28 either not under the control of its owner or handler or behaved
  2 29 aggressively.
  2 30    SERVICE DOG ABUSE ==== PENALTIES AND RESTITUTION.  Generally,
  2 31 a person convicted of service dog abuse is guilty of a simple
  2 32 misdemeanor.  However, a person owning or possessing the
  2 33 attacking dog is guilty of a serious misdemeanor if the  service
  2 34 dog was critically injured or killed, or the person has been
  2 35 convicted three or more times in the previous 10 years of an
  3  1 offense under the Code chapter.  A person owning or possessing
  3  2 the attacking dog is guilty of an aggravated misdemeanor if the
  3  3 attack was directly caused by the person's willful, malicious,
  3  4 or reckless act. The person must also pay restitution to the
  3  5 victim for certain expenses incurred by the attack, including
  3  6 for veterinary care or for the replacement of the service dog
  3  7 (see Code chapter 910).
  3  8    CRIMINAL PENALTIES.  A simple misdemeanor is punishable by
  3  9 confinement for no more than 30 days or a fine of at least
  3 10 $65 but not more than $625 or by both.  A serious misdemeanor
  3 11 is punishable by confinement for no more than one year and a
  3 12 fine of at least $315 but not more than $1,875. An aggravated
  3 13 misdemeanor is punishable by confinement for no more than two
  3 14 years and a fine of at least $625 but not more than $6,250.

  2  2 shall be limited to expenses for veterinary care, the temporary

  2  8    GENERAL.  This bill amends Code chapter 717B, which provides
  2  9 for offenses relating to the mistreatment of animals defined
  2 10 not to include livestock or game (Code section 717B.1). A
  2 11 person who intentionally injures, maims, disfigures, or

  2 19 defined as a dog classified as a service animal as provided
  2 20 in regulations adopted by the United States department of

  2 34 dog was critically injured or killed, or the person has been

  3  2 the attacking dog is guilty of an aggravated misdemeanor if the
  3  3 attack was directly caused by the person's willful, malicious,
  3  4 or reckless act. The person must also pay restitution to the
