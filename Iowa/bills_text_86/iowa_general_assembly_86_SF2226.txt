  4  5                           EXPLANATION
  4  6 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  4  7 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  4  8    This bill relates to the limitations of criminal actions
  4  9 (statute of limitations) in sexually motivated or exploitation
  4 10 offenses that involve a minor and modifies the criminal offense
  4 11 for disseminating obscene materials to minors.
  4 12    SEXUAL ABUSE.  The bill amends Code section 802.2 by allowing
  4 13 an indictment or information for sexual abuse in the first,
  4 14 second, or third degree committed on or with a person under 18
  4 15 years of age to be found within 25 years after the person upon
  4 16 whom the offense is committed attains 18 years of age.
  4 17    Current law provides that an indictment or information for

  4 19 on or with a person under 18 years of age shall be found within

  4 23 commits a class "A" felony and is subject to a special sentence
  4 24 under Code section 903B.1 for the rest of the person's life
  4 25 if the person ever completes the sentence for the underlying
  4 26 criminal offense. A person who commits sexual abuse in the
  4 27 second degree commits a class "B" felony  and is subject to
  4 28 a special sentence under Code section 903B.1 for the rest of

  4 31 abuse in the third degree commits a class "C" felony and is
  4 32 subject to a special sentence under Code section 903B.1 for
  4 33 the rest of the person's life upon completion of the sentence
  4 34 for the underlying criminal offense.  A person who commits any
  4 35 sexual abuse offense must register as a sex offender under Code
  5  1 section 692A.
  5  2    SEXUALLY MOTIVATED OR EXPLOITATION OFFENSES.  The bill
  5  3 creates new Code section 802.2C which allows an information
  5  4 or indictment for the following felony and aggravated and
  5  5 serious misdemeanor offenses and one simple misdemeanor offense
  5  6 committed on or with either a child under 14 years of age or a
  5  7 person under 18 years of age to be found within 25 years after
  5  8 the person upon whom the offense is committed attains 18 years
  5  9 of age: dissemination and exhibition of obscene material to
  5 10 minors in violation of Code section 728.2, admitting minors to

  5 12 Code section 728.3, public indecent exposure in violation of
  5 13 Code section 728.5(1)(f) or 728.5(2), sexual exploitation of a

  5 15 photographic print processor reports of depictions of minors
  5 16 engaged in prohibited sexual acts in violation of Code section
  5 17 728.14 (simple misdemeanor), and the criminal offense now known
  5 18 as using an electronic communication device to disseminate
  5 19 obscene material to minors in violation of Code section 728.15.
  5 20    Current law provides that an indictment or information for
  5 21 the offenses listed in the bill be found within three years
  5 22 after its commission.  However, under current law for sexual
  5 23 exploitation of a minor in violation of Code section 728.12,
  5 24 an indictment or information may be found 10 years after the
  5 25 person upon whom the offense is committed attains 18 years of
  5 26 age, and for depictions of minors engaged in prohibited acts in
  5 27 violation of Code section 728.14, an information may be found
  5 28 one year after the commission of the offense.
  5 29    A person who commits dissemination and exhibition of obscene
  5 30 material to minors commits a serious misdemeanor and must
  5 31 register as a sex offender.  A person who commits admitting
  5 32 minors to premises where obscene material is exhibited commits
  5 33 a serious or aggravated misdemeanor and must register as a
  5 34 sex offender.  A person who commits public indecent exposure
  5 35 commits a serious or aggravated misdemeanor.  A person who
  6  1 commits sexual exploitation of a minor commits an aggravated
  6  2 misdemeanor or a class "C" or class "D" felony depending on
  6  3 the facts and circumstances of the case and must register
  6  4 as a sex offender. A person who commits a felonious sexual
  6  5 exploitation of a minor is also subject to a special sentence
  6  6 under Code section 903B.1 for the rest of the person's life or
  6  7 a special Code section 903B.2 for 10 years upon completion of
  6  8 the sentence for the underlying criminal offense. A person
  6  9 who commits commercial film and photographic print processor
  6 10 reports of depictions of minors engaged in prohibited sexual
  6 11 acts commits a simple misdemeanor.  A person who commits
  6 12 the criminal offense now known under the bill as using an
  6 13 electronic communication device to disseminate obscene material
  6 14 to minors commits an aggravated misdemeanor or class "D" felony
  6 15 and must register as a sex offender.
  6 16    DNA PROFILE.  The bill also provides that if the person
  6 17 against whom the information or indictment is sought is
  6 18 identified through the use of a DNA profile for an offense
  6 19 described in the bill, an information or indictment shall be
  6 20 found within 25 years after the victim attains 18 years of age,
  6 21 or within three years from the date the person is identified by
  6 22 the person's DNA profile, whichever is later.
  6 23    ELECTRONIC DISSEMINATION OF OBSCENE MATERIAL.  The bill
  6 24 also amends Code section 728.15 by striking references to
  6 25 "telephone" and changing the name of the criminal offense
  6 26 of "telephone dissemination of obscene material to minors"
  6 27 to "using electronic communication device to disseminate
  6 28 obscene material to minors".  The bill defines "electronic
  6 29 communication device" to mean a telephone or a mobile telephone
  6 30 or other electronic device used to move information from one
  6 31 place to another.  The criminal penalty for a violation of
  6 32 Code section 728.15 remains an aggravated misdemeanor or class
  6 33 "D" felony depending on the facts and circumstances of the
  6 34 violation.
