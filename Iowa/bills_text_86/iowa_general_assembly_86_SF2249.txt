  1 14 a successor of the party in the manner provided in section
  1 15 562.7, whereupon the farm tenancy shall terminate March 1

  1 20 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with

  1 22    BILL.  This bill would require parties to a lease for land
  1 23 used in farming to make any agreement terminating the lease in
  1 24 writing.
  1 25    BACKGROUND.  A farm tenancy is a type of lease in which
  1 26 the lessor receives some form of rent from a lessee who uses
  1 27 the leased land to produce crops or livestock.  The relevant
  1 28 statutes refer to the lessee as the "farm tenant" and the
  1 29 farm's tenant's leasehold interest as a "farm tenancy" (see
  1 30 Code section 562.1A).  The lease may be made either in writing
  1 31 or orally.  Generally, all farm tenancies terminate on March
  1 32 1 at the end of the farm tenant's crop year.  However, in
  1 33 order to effectuate the termination, one party to the lease
  1 34 must have given the other party written notice of termination
  1 35 by the previous September 1 (Code sections 562.5 through
  2  1 562.7). Without such timely written notice of the termination,
  2  2 the lease automatically continues, under its same terms and
  2  3 conditions. The following September 1 is the latest date
  2  4 that a party may again exercise a right of termination by
  2  5 written notice effective the following first day of March.  One
  2  6 exception to the written notice requirement allows the parties
  2  7 to agree to the termination either in writing or orally.  The
  2  8 parties may make the agreement any time during the term of the
  2  9 lease, and the agreement may provide for a termination date
  2 10 earlier than March 1.
  2 11    The bill, in part, is a response to the Iowa Court of
  2 12 Appeals' decision in Auen v. Auen, 851 N.W.2d 547 (Iowa Ct.
  2 13 App. 2014).

  1 15 562.7, whereupon the farm tenancy shall terminate March 1

  1 20 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with

  1 22    BILL.  This bill would require parties to a lease for land
  1 23 used in farming to make any agreement terminating the lease in
  1 24 writing.
  1 25    BACKGROUND.  A farm tenancy is a type of lease in which
  1 26 the lessor receives some form of rent from a lessee who uses
  1 27 the leased land to produce crops or livestock.  The relevant
  1 28 statutes refer to the lessee as the "farm tenant" and the
  1 29 farm's tenant's leasehold interest as a "farm tenancy" (see
  1 30 Code section 562.1A).  The lease may be made either in writing
  1 31 or orally.  Generally, all farm tenancies terminate on March
  1 32 1 at the end of the farm tenant's crop year.  However, in
  1 33 order to effectuate the termination, one party to the lease
  1 34 must have given the other party written notice of termination
  1 35 by the previous September 1 (Code sections 562.5 through
  2  1 562.7). Without such timely written notice of the termination,
  2  2 the lease automatically continues, under its same terms and
  2  3 conditions. The following September 1 is the latest date
  2  4 that a party may again exercise a right of termination by
  2  5 written notice effective the following first day of March.  One
  2  6 exception to the written notice requirement allows the parties
  2  7 to agree to the termination either in writing or orally.  The
  2  8 parties may make the agreement any time during the term of the
  2  9 lease, and the agreement may provide for a termination date
  2 10 earlier than March 1.
  2 11    The bill, in part, is a response to the Iowa Court of
  2 12 Appeals' decision in Auen v. Auen, 851 N.W.2d 547 (Iowa Ct.
  2 13 App. 2014).

  1 22    BILL.  This bill would require parties to a lease for land
  1 23 used in farming to make any agreement terminating the lease in
  1 24 writing.
  1 25    BACKGROUND.  A farm tenancy is a type of lease in which
  1 26 the lessor receives some form of rent from a lessee who uses
  1 27 the leased land to produce crops or livestock.  The relevant
  1 28 statutes refer to the lessee as the "farm tenant" and the
  1 29 farm's tenant's leasehold interest as a "farm tenancy" (see
  1 30 Code section 562.1A).  The lease may be made either in writing
  1 31 or orally.  Generally, all farm tenancies terminate on March
  1 32 1 at the end of the farm tenant's crop year.  However, in
  1 33 order to effectuate the termination, one party to the lease
  1 34 must have given the other party written notice of termination
  1 35 by the previous September 1 (Code sections 562.5 through
  2  1 562.7). Without such timely written notice of the termination,
  2  2 the lease automatically continues, under its same terms and
  2  3 conditions. The following September 1 is the latest date
  2  4 that a party may again exercise a right of termination by
  2  5 written notice effective the following first day of March.  One
  2  6 exception to the written notice requirement allows the parties
  2  7 to agree to the termination either in writing or orally.  The
  2  8 parties may make the agreement any time during the term of the
  2  9 lease, and the agreement may provide for a termination date
  2 10 earlier than March 1.
  2 11    The bill, in part, is a response to the Iowa Court of
  2 12 Appeals' decision in Auen v. Auen, 851 N.W.2d 547 (Iowa Ct.
  2 13 App. 2014).
