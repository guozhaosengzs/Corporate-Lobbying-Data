  3 21 prohibition on unlicensed carrying of weapons.
  3 22    The availability of a professional or nonprofessional permit
  3 23 to carry weapons under this chapter shall not be construed
  3 24 to impose a general prohibition on the unlicensed carrying,
  3 25 whether openly or concealed, of a deadly weapon, including a

  3 27                           EXPLANATION
  3 28 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  3 29 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  3 30    This bill relates to the carrying and possession of weapons
  3 31 and provides penalties.
  3 32    The bill amends Code section 708.8, the crime of going armed
  3 33 with a dangerous weapon with intent, a class "D" felony, to
  3 34 provide that the intent element required for a violation of
  3 35 this crime shall not be inferred from the mere carrying or
  4  1 concealment of a dangerous weapon.
  4  2    The bill amends Code section 724.4 by striking the original
  4  3 penalty for carrying dangerous weapons. Instead, the bill
  4  4 creates a new crime of going armed with a knife in the
  4  5 commission of a crime, an aggravated misdemeanor.  The bill
  4  6 makes a conforming change to Code section 232.52, subsection
  4  7 2, relating to the suspension or revocation of a juvenile's
  4  8 driver's license or operating privilege. The bill also makes a
  4  9 conforming Code change to Code section 724.4B, relating to the
  4 10 carrying of weapons on school grounds, to specifically include
  4 11 certain categories of persons who are authorized to carry
  4 12 weapons on school grounds.
  4 13    The bill amends Code section 724.4C relating to the crime of
  4 14 possession or carrying of firearms while under the influence
  4 15 of alcohol or a drug.  Current law invalidates a permit to
  4 16 carry weapons if the person to whom the permit is issued is
  4 17 intoxicated, as defined in Code section 321J.2, subsection 1
  4 18 (while under the influence of an alcoholic beverage or other
  4 19 drug or a combination of such substances, while having an
  4 20 alcohol concentration of .08 or more, or while any amount of a
  4 21 controlled substance is present in the person, as measured in
  4 22 the person's blood or urine).  The bill amends this provision
  4 23 to provide that a person commits a serious misdemeanor if
  4 24 the person is intoxicated and the person either carries a
  4 25 dangerous weapon on or about the person or carries a dangerous
  4 26 weapon within the person's immediate access or reach while in
  4 27 a vehicle.  This crime does not apply to situations where a
  4 28 person carries or possesses a dangerous weapon while in the
  4 29 person's own dwelling, place of business, or on the person's
  4 30 land, and the transitory possession or use of a firearm during

  4 32 another, if the possession of the firearm lasts no longer than
  4 33 immediately necessary to resolve the emergency.
  4 34    The bill strikes Code section 724.5 relating to a person's
  4 35 duty to carry a valid permit to carry certain weapons for
  5  1 which a permit has been issued to the person and replaces that
  5  2 Code section with language providing that the availability
