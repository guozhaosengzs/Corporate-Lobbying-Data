 11 34                           EXPLANATION
 11 35 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
 12  1 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
 12  2    This bill creates the medical cannabis Act and provides for
 12  3 criminal penalties and fees.
 12  4    The bill amends Code section 124.401, relating to prohibited
 12  5 acts involving controlled substances, to provide that it is
 12  6 lawful for a person to knowingly or intentionally recommend,
 12  7 possess, use, dispense, deliver, transport, or administer
 12  8 medical cannabis if the recommendation, possession, use,
 12  9 dispensing, delivery, transporting, or administering is in
 12 10 accordance with the provisions of the bill.
 12 11    The bill establishes new Code chapter 124E, the medical
 12 12 cannabis Act, to allow for the medical use of cannabis for
 12 13 alleviating symptoms caused by debilitating medical conditions
 12 14 and their medical treatments.  The bill defines "medical use
 12 15 of cannabis" to mean the acquisition, possession, cultivation,
 12 16 manufacture, use, delivery, transfer, or transportation of
 12 17 cannabis or related paraphernalia to treat or alleviate a
 12 18 registered qualified patient's debilitating medical condition
 12 19 as defined in the bill. The bill defines "cannabis" to mean
 12 20 all parts of the plants of the genus cannabis, whether growing
 12 21 or not; the seeds thereof; the resin extracted from any part of
 12 22 the plant; and every compound, manufacture, salt, derivative,
 12 23 mixture, or preparation of the plant, its seeds, or resin,
 12 24 including tetrahydrocannabinols.  It does not include the
 12 25 mature stalks of the plant; fiber produced from the stalks; oil
 12 26 or cake made from the seeds of the plant; any other compound,
 12 27 manufacture, salt, derivative, mixture, or preparation of the
 12 28 mature stalks, except the resin extracted therefrom; fiber;
 12 29 or oil or cake or the sterilized seed of the plant which is
 12 30 incapable of germination (see also Code section 124.101(19)).
 12 31    The bill provides that a qualified patient who has been
 12 32 issued and who possesses a registry identification card issued
 12 33 by the Iowa department of public health shall not be subject to
 12 34 arrest or prosecution, civil or criminal penalty, or the denial
 12 35 of any right or privilege for the medical use of cannabis if
 13  1 the quantity of cannabis does not exceed an adequate supply.
 13  2 The bill also provides the same immunity for a qualified
 13  3 patient's primary caregiver and for a licensed producer.
 13  4    The bill defines a qualified patient as a resident of this
 13  5 state who has been diagnosed by a practitioner as having a
 13  6 debilitating medical condition as specified in the bill and
 13  7 who has received written certification by a practitioner and
 13  8 has been issued a registry identification card pursuant to the
 13  9 new Code chapter. A qualified patient may designate one or
 13 10 more primary caregivers. A primary caregiver is defined as a
 13 11 resident of this state, at least 18 years old, who has been
 13 12 designated by the patient's practitioner or a person having
 13 13 legal custody of the qualified patient as being necessary to
 13 14 take responsibility for managing the well=being of a qualified
 13 15 patient with respect to the medical use of cannabis pursuant
 13 16 to the provisions of the bill.  "Licensed producer" is defined
 13 17 as any qualified patient, primary caregiver, or nonprofit
 13 18 private entity within this state that the department of public
 13 19 health determines to be qualified to process, produce, possess,
 13 20 manufacture, distribute, dispense, deliver, and transport
 13 21 cannabis in this state under the bill.  A qualified patient or
 13 22 primary caregiver licensed as a producer shall produce no more
 13 23 than an adequate supply of cannabis for the patient's personal
 13 24 use only. "Practitioner" is defined as a person licensed in
 13 25 this state to prescribe and administer a controlled substance
 13 26 regulated under Code chapter 124.
 13 27    The bill provides that participation in the medical use of
 13 28 cannabis program by a qualified patient or primary caregiver
 13 29 does not relieve the qualified patient or primary caregiver
 13 30 from prosecution or civil penalties for activities not
 13 31 authorized under the bill, liability for damages or criminal
 13 32 prosecution arising out of the operation of a vehicle while
 13 33 under the influence of cannabis, or other criminal prosecution
 13 34 or civil penalties for possession or use of cannabis in certain
 13 35 situations.  A qualified patient or primary caregiver who
 14  1 makes a fraudulent representation to a law enforcement officer
 14  2 about the person's medical use of cannabis to avoid arrest
 14  3 or prosecution for a cannabis=related offense is guilty of a
 14  4 simple misdemeanor.
 14  5    The bill directs the department of public health to
 14  6 establish a medical cannabis advisory board no later
 14  7 than August 15, 2016, consisting of eight practitioners
 14  8 representing the fields of neurology, pain management, medical
 14  9 oncology, psychiatry, infectious disease, family medicine,
 14 10 and gynecology.  The practitioners shall be nationally
 14 11 board=certified in their area of specialty and knowledgeable
 14 12 about the medical use of cannabis and appointed by the
 14 13 director of public health from a list proposed by the Iowa
 14 14 medical society.  The advisory board is required to review
 14 15 and recommend to the department for approval additional
 14 16 debilitating medical conditions for persons who would benefit
 14 17 from the medical use of cannabis, accept and review petitions
 14 18 to add medical conditions, medical treatments, or diseases
 14 19 to the list of debilitating medical conditions that qualify
 14 20 for the medical use of cannabis, meet at least twice per year
 14 21 to conduct public hearings and to evaluate petitions to add
 14 22 medical conditions, medical treatments, or diseases to the
 14 23 list of debilitating medical conditions that qualify for the
 14 24 medical use of cannabis, issue recommendations concerning rules
 14 25 to be adopted for the issuance of registry identification
 14 26 cards, recommend quantities of cannabis that are necessary
 14 27 to constitute an adequate supply for qualified patients and
 14 28 primary caregivers, and review actions of the department in
 14 29 approving or denying registry identification card applications.
 14 30    The department is required to adopt rules pursuant to
 14 31 Code chapter 17A to establish and implement a medical use of
 14 32 cannabis program consistent with the purpose of the bill no
 14 33 later than October 1, 2016. The department is authorized to
 14 34 adopt emergency rules pursuant to Code chapter 17A.  The rules
 14 35 shall relate to applications for new and renewal registry
 15  1 identification cards and for qualified patients and primary
 15  2 caregivers, the amount of cannabis that constitutes an adequate
 15  3 supply for purposes of the bill, including amounts for topical
 15  4 treatments, criteria and procedures for including additional
 15  5 medical conditions, medical treatments, or diseases as
 15  6 debilitating medical conditions that qualify for the medical
 15  7 use of cannabis, requirements for the licensure of producers,
 15  8 the development of a distribution system for medical cannabis
 15  9 within this state, the establishment of application and renewal
 15 10 fees that generate revenues sufficient to offset all expenses
 15 11 of implementing and administering the new Code chapter, and
 15 12 specify and implement procedures that address public safety
 15 13 including security procedures and product quality, safety,
 15 14 and labeling. The department is to maintain confidential
 15 15 information collected pursuant to the bill and provide for the
 15 16 release of certain information to certain persons under certain
 15 17 confidentiality guidelines and to submit an annual report to
 15 18 the general assembly by January 15 of each year.
 15 19    The department is also required to issue a registry
 15 20 identification card to a qualified patient and any primary
 15 21 caregiver named in the qualified patient's application, if the
 15 22 qualified patient and each primary caregiver submit certain
 15 23 information in an application to the department.  The bill
 15 24 provides that possession of or application for a registry
 15 25 identification card shall not constitute probable cause or
 15 26 give rise to reasonable suspicion for a governmental agency
 15 27 to search the person or property of the person possessing or
 15 28 applying for the card.
 15 29    The bill provides that the department may adopt emergency
 15 30 rules and the rules shall be effective immediately upon filing
 15 31 unless a later date is specified in the rules.
 15 32    The bill provides that a medical cannabis registration card
 15 33 issued under Code chapter 124D (medical cannabidiol Act) prior
 15 34 to July 1, 2015, shall remain effective and continues in effect
 15 35 as issued for the 12=month period following its issuance.

 11 34                           EXPLANATION
 11 35 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
 12  1 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
 12  2    This bill creates the medical cannabis Act and provides for
 12  3 criminal penalties and fees.
 12  4    The bill amends Code section 124.401, relating to prohibited
 12  5 acts involving controlled substances, to provide that it is
 12  6 lawful for a person to knowingly or intentionally recommend,
 12  7 possess, use, dispense, deliver, transport, or administer
 12  8 medical cannabis if the recommendation, possession, use,
 12  9 dispensing, delivery, transporting, or administering is in
 12 10 accordance with the provisions of the bill.
 12 11    The bill establishes new Code chapter 124E, the medical
 12 12 cannabis Act, to allow for the medical use of cannabis for
 12 13 alleviating symptoms caused by debilitating medical conditions
 12 14 and their medical treatments.  The bill defines "medical use
 12 15 of cannabis" to mean the acquisition, possession, cultivation,
 12 16 manufacture, use, delivery, transfer, or transportation of
 12 17 cannabis or related paraphernalia to treat or alleviate a
 12 18 registered qualified patient's debilitating medical condition
 12 19 as defined in the bill. The bill defines "cannabis" to mean
 12 20 all parts of the plants of the genus cannabis, whether growing
 12 21 or not; the seeds thereof; the resin extracted from any part of
 12 22 the plant; and every compound, manufacture, salt, derivative,
 12 23 mixture, or preparation of the plant, its seeds, or resin,
 12 24 including tetrahydrocannabinols.  It does not include the
 12 25 mature stalks of the plant; fiber produced from the stalks; oil
 12 26 or cake made from the seeds of the plant; any other compound,
 12 27 manufacture, salt, derivative, mixture, or preparation of the
 12 28 mature stalks, except the resin extracted therefrom; fiber;
 12 29 or oil or cake or the sterilized seed of the plant which is
 12 30 incapable of germination (see also Code section 124.101(19)).
 12 31    The bill provides that a qualified patient who has been
 12 32 issued and who possesses a registry identification card issued
 12 33 by the Iowa department of public health shall not be subject to
 12 34 arrest or prosecution, civil or criminal penalty, or the denial
 12 35 of any right or privilege for the medical use of cannabis if
 13  1 the quantity of cannabis does not exceed an adequate supply.
 13  2 The bill also provides the same immunity for a qualified
 13  3 patient's primary caregiver and for a licensed producer.
 13  4    The bill defines a qualified patient as a resident of this
 13  5 state who has been diagnosed by a practitioner as having a
 13  6 debilitating medical condition as specified in the bill and
 13  7 who has received written certification by a practitioner and
 13  8 has been issued a registry identification card pursuant to the
 13  9 new Code chapter. A qualified patient may designate one or
 13 10 more primary caregivers. A primary caregiver is defined as a
 13 11 resident of this state, at least 18 years old, who has been
 13 12 designated by the patient's practitioner or a person having
 13 13 legal custody of the qualified patient as being necessary to
 13 14 take responsibility for managing the well=being of a qualified
 13 15 patient with respect to the medical use of cannabis pursuant
 13 16 to the provisions of the bill.  "Licensed producer" is defined
 13 17 as any qualified patient, primary caregiver, or nonprofit
 13 18 private entity within this state that the department of public
 13 19 health determines to be qualified to process, produce, possess,
 13 20 manufacture, distribute, dispense, deliver, and transport
 13 21 cannabis in this state under the bill.  A qualified patient or
 13 22 primary caregiver licensed as a producer shall produce no more
 13 23 than an adequate supply of cannabis for the patient's personal
 13 24 use only. "Practitioner" is defined as a person licensed in
 13 25 this state to prescribe and administer a controlled substance
 13 26 regulated under Code chapter 124.
 13 27    The bill provides that participation in the medical use of
 13 28 cannabis program by a qualified patient or primary caregiver
 13 29 does not relieve the qualified patient or primary caregiver
 13 30 from prosecution or civil penalties for activities not
 13 31 authorized under the bill, liability for damages or criminal
 13 32 prosecution arising out of the operation of a vehicle while
 13 33 under the influence of cannabis, or other criminal prosecution
 13 34 or civil penalties for possession or use of cannabis in certain
 13 35 situations.  A qualified patient or primary caregiver who
 14  1 makes a fraudulent representation to a law enforcement officer
 14  2 about the person's medical use of cannabis to avoid arrest
 14  3 or prosecution for a cannabis=related offense is guilty of a
 14  4 simple misdemeanor.
 14  5    The bill directs the department of public health to
 14  6 establish a medical cannabis advisory board no later
 14  7 than August 15, 2016, consisting of eight practitioners
 14  8 representing the fields of neurology, pain management, medical
 14  9 oncology, psychiatry, infectious disease, family medicine,
 14 10 and gynecology.  The practitioners shall be nationally
 14 11 board=certified in their area of specialty and knowledgeable
 14 12 about the medical use of cannabis and appointed by the
 14 13 director of public health from a list proposed by the Iowa
 14 14 medical society.  The advisory board is required to review
 14 15 and recommend to the department for approval additional
 14 16 debilitating medical conditions for persons who would benefit
 14 17 from the medical use of cannabis, accept and review petitions
 14 18 to add medical conditions, medical treatments, or diseases
 14 19 to the list of debilitating medical conditions that qualify
 14 20 for the medical use of cannabis, meet at least twice per year
 14 21 to conduct public hearings and to evaluate petitions to add
 14 22 medical conditions, medical treatments, or diseases to the
 14 23 list of debilitating medical conditions that qualify for the
 14 24 medical use of cannabis, issue recommendations concerning rules
 14 25 to be adopted for the issuance of registry identification
 14 26 cards, recommend quantities of cannabis that are necessary
 14 27 to constitute an adequate supply for qualified patients and
 14 28 primary caregivers, and review actions of the department in
 14 29 approving or denying registry identification card applications.
 14 30    The department is required to adopt rules pursuant to
 14 31 Code chapter 17A to establish and implement a medical use of
 14 32 cannabis program consistent with the purpose of the bill no
 14 33 later than October 1, 2016. The department is authorized to
 14 34 adopt emergency rules pursuant to Code chapter 17A.  The rules
 14 35 shall relate to applications for new and renewal registry
 15  1 identification cards and for qualified patients and primary
 15  2 caregivers, the amount of cannabis that constitutes an adequate
 15  3 supply for purposes of the bill, including amounts for topical
 15  4 treatments, criteria and procedures for including additional
 15  5 medical conditions, medical treatments, or diseases as
 15  6 debilitating medical conditions that qualify for the medical
 15  7 use of cannabis, requirements for the licensure of producers,
 15  8 the development of a distribution system for medical cannabis
 15  9 within this state, the establishment of application and renewal
 15 10 fees that generate revenues sufficient to offset all expenses
 15 11 of implementing and administering the new Code chapter, and
 15 12 specify and implement procedures that address public safety
 15 13 including security procedures and product quality, safety,
 15 14 and labeling. The department is to maintain confidential
 15 15 information collected pursuant to the bill and provide for the
 15 16 release of certain information to certain persons under certain
 15 17 confidentiality guidelines and to submit an annual report to
 15 18 the general assembly by January 15 of each year.
 15 19    The department is also required to issue a registry
 15 20 identification card to a qualified patient and any primary
 15 21 caregiver named in the qualified patient's application, if the
 15 22 qualified patient and each primary caregiver submit certain
 15 23 information in an application to the department.  The bill
 15 24 provides that possession of or application for a registry
 15 25 identification card shall not constitute probable cause or
 15 26 give rise to reasonable suspicion for a governmental agency
 15 27 to search the person or property of the person possessing or
 15 28 applying for the card.
 15 29    The bill provides that the department may adopt emergency
 15 30 rules and the rules shall be effective immediately upon filing
 15 31 unless a later date is specified in the rules.
 15 32    The bill provides that a medical cannabis registration card
 15 33 issued under Code chapter 124D (medical cannabidiol Act) prior
 15 34 to July 1, 2015, shall remain effective and continues in effect
 15 35 as issued for the 12=month period following its issuance.

 12 11    The bill establishes new Code chapter 124E, the medical
 12 12 cannabis Act, to allow for the medical use of cannabis for

 11 34                           EXPLANATION
 11 35 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
 12  1 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
 12  2    This bill creates the medical cannabis Act and provides for
 12  3 criminal penalties and fees.
 12  4    The bill amends Code section 124.401, relating to prohibited
 12  5 acts involving controlled substances, to provide that it is
 12  6 lawful for a person to knowingly or intentionally recommend,
 12  7 possess, use, dispense, deliver, transport, or administer
 12  8 medical cannabis if the recommendation, possession, use,
 12  9 dispensing, delivery, transporting, or administering is in
 12 10 accordance with the provisions of the bill.
 12 11    The bill establishes new Code chapter 124E, the medical
 12 12 cannabis Act, to allow for the medical use of cannabis for
 12 13 alleviating symptoms caused by debilitating medical conditions
 12 14 and their medical treatments.  The bill defines "medical use
 12 15 of cannabis" to mean the acquisition, possession, cultivation,
 12 16 manufacture, use, delivery, transfer, or transportation of
 12 17 cannabis or related paraphernalia to treat or alleviate a
 12 18 registered qualified patient's debilitating medical condition
 12 19 as defined in the bill. The bill defines "cannabis" to mean
 12 20 all parts of the plants of the genus cannabis, whether growing
 12 21 or not; the seeds thereof; the resin extracted from any part of
 12 22 the plant; and every compound, manufacture, salt, derivative,
 12 23 mixture, or preparation of the plant, its seeds, or resin,
 12 24 including tetrahydrocannabinols.  It does not include the
 12 25 mature stalks of the plant; fiber produced from the stalks; oil
 12 26 or cake made from the seeds of the plant; any other compound,
 12 27 manufacture, salt, derivative, mixture, or preparation of the
 12 28 mature stalks, except the resin extracted therefrom; fiber;
 12 29 or oil or cake or the sterilized seed of the plant which is
 12 30 incapable of germination (see also Code section 124.101(19)).
 12 31    The bill provides that a qualified patient who has been
 12 32 issued and who possesses a registry identification card issued
 12 33 by the Iowa department of public health shall not be subject to
 12 34 arrest or prosecution, civil or criminal penalty, or the denial
 12 35 of any right or privilege for the medical use of cannabis if
 13  1 the quantity of cannabis does not exceed an adequate supply.
 13  2 The bill also provides the same immunity for a qualified
 13  3 patient's primary caregiver and for a licensed producer.
 13  4    The bill defines a qualified patient as a resident of this
 13  5 state who has been diagnosed by a practitioner as having a
 13  6 debilitating medical condition as specified in the bill and
 13  7 who has received written certification by a practitioner and
 13  8 has been issued a registry identification card pursuant to the
 13  9 new Code chapter. A qualified patient may designate one or
 13 10 more primary caregivers. A primary caregiver is defined as a
 13 11 resident of this state, at least 18 years old, who has been
 13 12 designated by the patient's practitioner or a person having
 13 13 legal custody of the qualified patient as being necessary to
 13 14 take responsibility for managing the well=being of a qualified
 13 15 patient with respect to the medical use of cannabis pursuant
 13 16 to the provisions of the bill.  "Licensed producer" is defined
 13 17 as any qualified patient, primary caregiver, or nonprofit
 13 18 private entity within this state that the department of public
 13 19 health determines to be qualified to process, produce, possess,
 13 20 manufacture, distribute, dispense, deliver, and transport
 13 21 cannabis in this state under the bill.  A qualified patient or
 13 22 primary caregiver licensed as a producer shall produce no more
 13 23 than an adequate supply of cannabis for the patient's personal
 13 24 use only. "Practitioner" is defined as a person licensed in
 13 25 this state to prescribe and administer a controlled substance
 13 26 regulated under Code chapter 124.
 13 27    The bill provides that participation in the medical use of
 13 28 cannabis program by a qualified patient or primary caregiver
 13 29 does not relieve the qualified patient or primary caregiver
 13 30 from prosecution or civil penalties for activities not
 13 31 authorized under the bill, liability for damages or criminal
 13 32 prosecution arising out of the operation of a vehicle while
 13 33 under the influence of cannabis, or other criminal prosecution
 13 34 or civil penalties for possession or use of cannabis in certain
 13 35 situations.  A qualified patient or primary caregiver who
 14  1 makes a fraudulent representation to a law enforcement officer
 14  2 about the person's medical use of cannabis to avoid arrest
 14  3 or prosecution for a cannabis=related offense is guilty of a
 14  4 simple misdemeanor.
 14  5    The bill directs the department of public health to
 14  6 establish a medical cannabis advisory board no later
 14  7 than August 15, 2016, consisting of eight practitioners
 14  8 representing the fields of neurology, pain management, medical
 14  9 oncology, psychiatry, infectious disease, family medicine,
 14 10 and gynecology.  The practitioners shall be nationally
 14 11 board=certified in their area of specialty and knowledgeable
 14 12 about the medical use of cannabis and appointed by the
 14 13 director of public health from a list proposed by the Iowa
 14 14 medical society.  The advisory board is required to review
 14 15 and recommend to the department for approval additional
 14 16 debilitating medical conditions for persons who would benefit
 14 17 from the medical use of cannabis, accept and review petitions
 14 18 to add medical conditions, medical treatments, or diseases
 14 19 to the list of debilitating medical conditions that qualify
 14 20 for the medical use of cannabis, meet at least twice per year
 14 21 to conduct public hearings and to evaluate petitions to add
 14 22 medical conditions, medical treatments, or diseases to the
 14 23 list of debilitating medical conditions that qualify for the
 14 24 medical use of cannabis, issue recommendations concerning rules
 14 25 to be adopted for the issuance of registry identification
 14 26 cards, recommend quantities of cannabis that are necessary
 14 27 to constitute an adequate supply for qualified patients and
 14 28 primary caregivers, and review actions of the department in
 14 29 approving or denying registry identification card applications.
 14 30    The department is required to adopt rules pursuant to
 14 31 Code chapter 17A to establish and implement a medical use of
 14 32 cannabis program consistent with the purpose of the bill no
 14 33 later than October 1, 2016. The department is authorized to
 14 34 adopt emergency rules pursuant to Code chapter 17A.  The rules
 14 35 shall relate to applications for new and renewal registry
 15  1 identification cards and for qualified patients and primary
 15  2 caregivers, the amount of cannabis that constitutes an adequate
 15  3 supply for purposes of the bill, including amounts for topical
 15  4 treatments, criteria and procedures for including additional
 15  5 medical conditions, medical treatments, or diseases as
 15  6 debilitating medical conditions that qualify for the medical
 15  7 use of cannabis, requirements for the licensure of producers,
 15  8 the development of a distribution system for medical cannabis
 15  9 within this state, the establishment of application and renewal
 15 10 fees that generate revenues sufficient to offset all expenses
 15 11 of implementing and administering the new Code chapter, and
 15 12 specify and implement procedures that address public safety
 15 13 including security procedures and product quality, safety,
 15 14 and labeling. The department is to maintain confidential
 15 15 information collected pursuant to the bill and provide for the
 15 16 release of certain information to certain persons under certain
 15 17 confidentiality guidelines and to submit an annual report to
 15 18 the general assembly by January 15 of each year.
 15 19    The department is also required to issue a registry
 15 20 identification card to a qualified patient and any primary
 15 21 caregiver named in the qualified patient's application, if the
 15 22 qualified patient and each primary caregiver submit certain
 15 23 information in an application to the department.  The bill
 15 24 provides that possession of or application for a registry
 15 25 identification card shall not constitute probable cause or
 15 26 give rise to reasonable suspicion for a governmental agency
 15 27 to search the person or property of the person possessing or
 15 28 applying for the card.
 15 29    The bill provides that the department may adopt emergency
 15 30 rules and the rules shall be effective immediately upon filing
 15 31 unless a later date is specified in the rules.
 15 32    The bill provides that a medical cannabis registration card
 15 33 issued under Code chapter 124D (medical cannabidiol Act) prior
 15 34 to July 1, 2015, shall remain effective and continues in effect
 15 35 as issued for the 12=month period following its issuance.

 11 34                           EXPLANATION
 11 35 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
 12  1 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
 12  2    This bill creates the medical cannabis Act and provides for
 12  3 criminal penalties and fees.
 12  4    The bill amends Code section 124.401, relating to prohibited
 12  5 acts involving controlled substances, to provide that it is
 12  6 lawful for a person to knowingly or intentionally recommend,
 12  7 possess, use, dispense, deliver, transport, or administer
 12  8 medical cannabis if the recommendation, possession, use,
 12  9 dispensing, delivery, transporting, or administering is in
 12 10 accordance with the provisions of the bill.
 12 11    The bill establishes new Code chapter 124E, the medical
 12 12 cannabis Act, to allow for the medical use of cannabis for
 12 13 alleviating symptoms caused by debilitating medical conditions
 12 14 and their medical treatments.  The bill defines "medical use
 12 15 of cannabis" to mean the acquisition, possession, cultivation,
 12 16 manufacture, use, delivery, transfer, or transportation of
 12 17 cannabis or related paraphernalia to treat or alleviate a
 12 18 registered qualified patient's debilitating medical condition
 12 19 as defined in the bill. The bill defines "cannabis" to mean
 12 20 all parts of the plants of the genus cannabis, whether growing
 12 21 or not; the seeds thereof; the resin extracted from any part of
 12 22 the plant; and every compound, manufacture, salt, derivative,
 12 23 mixture, or preparation of the plant, its seeds, or resin,
 12 24 including tetrahydrocannabinols.  It does not include the
 12 25 mature stalks of the plant; fiber produced from the stalks; oil
 12 26 or cake made from the seeds of the plant; any other compound,
 12 27 manufacture, salt, derivative, mixture, or preparation of the
 12 28 mature stalks, except the resin extracted therefrom; fiber;
 12 29 or oil or cake or the sterilized seed of the plant which is
 12 30 incapable of germination (see also Code section 124.101(19)).
 12 31    The bill provides that a qualified patient who has been
 12 32 issued and who possesses a registry identification card issued
 12 33 by the Iowa department of public health shall not be subject to
 12 34 arrest or prosecution, civil or criminal penalty, or the denial
 12 35 of any right or privilege for the medical use of cannabis if
 13  1 the quantity of cannabis does not exceed an adequate supply.
 13  2 The bill also provides the same immunity for a qualified
 13  3 patient's primary caregiver and for a licensed producer.
 13  4    The bill defines a qualified patient as a resident of this
 13  5 state who has been diagnosed by a practitioner as having a
 13  6 debilitating medical condition as specified in the bill and
 13  7 who has received written certification by a practitioner and
 13  8 has been issued a registry identification card pursuant to the
 13  9 new Code chapter. A qualified patient may designate one or
 13 10 more primary caregivers. A primary caregiver is defined as a
 13 11 resident of this state, at least 18 years old, who has been
 13 12 designated by the patient's practitioner or a person having
 13 13 legal custody of the qualified patient as being necessary to
 13 14 take responsibility for managing the well=being of a qualified
 13 15 patient with respect to the medical use of cannabis pursuant
 13 16 to the provisions of the bill.  "Licensed producer" is defined
 13 17 as any qualified patient, primary caregiver, or nonprofit
 13 18 private entity within this state that the department of public
 13 19 health determines to be qualified to process, produce, possess,
 13 20 manufacture, distribute, dispense, deliver, and transport
 13 21 cannabis in this state under the bill.  A qualified patient or
 13 22 primary caregiver licensed as a producer shall produce no more
 13 23 than an adequate supply of cannabis for the patient's personal
 13 24 use only. "Practitioner" is defined as a person licensed in
 13 25 this state to prescribe and administer a controlled substance
 13 26 regulated under Code chapter 124.
 13 27    The bill provides that participation in the medical use of
 13 28 cannabis program by a qualified patient or primary caregiver
 13 29 does not relieve the qualified patient or primary caregiver
 13 30 from prosecution or civil penalties for activities not
 13 31 authorized under the bill, liability for damages or criminal
 13 32 prosecution arising out of the operation of a vehicle while
 13 33 under the influence of cannabis, or other criminal prosecution
 13 34 or civil penalties for possession or use of cannabis in certain
 13 35 situations.  A qualified patient or primary caregiver who
 14  1 makes a fraudulent representation to a law enforcement officer
 14  2 about the person's medical use of cannabis to avoid arrest
 14  3 or prosecution for a cannabis=related offense is guilty of a
 14  4 simple misdemeanor.
 14  5    The bill directs the department of public health to
 14  6 establish a medical cannabis advisory board no later
 14  7 than August 15, 2016, consisting of eight practitioners
 14  8 representing the fields of neurology, pain management, medical
 14  9 oncology, psychiatry, infectious disease, family medicine,
 14 10 and gynecology.  The practitioners shall be nationally
 14 11 board=certified in their area of specialty and knowledgeable
 14 12 about the medical use of cannabis and appointed by the
 14 13 director of public health from a list proposed by the Iowa
 14 14 medical society.  The advisory board is required to review
 14 15 and recommend to the department for approval additional
 14 16 debilitating medical conditions for persons who would benefit
 14 17 from the medical use of cannabis, accept and review petitions
 14 18 to add medical conditions, medical treatments, or diseases
 14 19 to the list of debilitating medical conditions that qualify
 14 20 for the medical use of cannabis, meet at least twice per year
 14 21 to conduct public hearings and to evaluate petitions to add
 14 22 medical conditions, medical treatments, or diseases to the
 14 23 list of debilitating medical conditions that qualify for the
 14 24 medical use of cannabis, issue recommendations concerning rules
 14 25 to be adopted for the issuance of registry identification
 14 26 cards, recommend quantities of cannabis that are necessary
 14 27 to constitute an adequate supply for qualified patients and
 14 28 primary caregivers, and review actions of the department in
 14 29 approving or denying registry identification card applications.
 14 30    The department is required to adopt rules pursuant to
 14 31 Code chapter 17A to establish and implement a medical use of
 14 32 cannabis program consistent with the purpose of the bill no
 14 33 later than October 1, 2016. The department is authorized to
 14 34 adopt emergency rules pursuant to Code chapter 17A.  The rules
 14 35 shall relate to applications for new and renewal registry
 15  1 identification cards and for qualified patients and primary
 15  2 caregivers, the amount of cannabis that constitutes an adequate
 15  3 supply for purposes of the bill, including amounts for topical
 15  4 treatments, criteria and procedures for including additional
 15  5 medical conditions, medical treatments, or diseases as
 15  6 debilitating medical conditions that qualify for the medical
 15  7 use of cannabis, requirements for the licensure of producers,
 15  8 the development of a distribution system for medical cannabis
 15  9 within this state, the establishment of application and renewal
 15 10 fees that generate revenues sufficient to offset all expenses
 15 11 of implementing and administering the new Code chapter, and
 15 12 specify and implement procedures that address public safety
 15 13 including security procedures and product quality, safety,
 15 14 and labeling. The department is to maintain confidential
 15 15 information collected pursuant to the bill and provide for the
 15 16 release of certain information to certain persons under certain
 15 17 confidentiality guidelines and to submit an annual report to
 15 18 the general assembly by January 15 of each year.
 15 19    The department is also required to issue a registry
 15 20 identification card to a qualified patient and any primary
 15 21 caregiver named in the qualified patient's application, if the
 15 22 qualified patient and each primary caregiver submit certain
 15 23 information in an application to the department.  The bill
 15 24 provides that possession of or application for a registry
 15 25 identification card shall not constitute probable cause or
 15 26 give rise to reasonable suspicion for a governmental agency
 15 27 to search the person or property of the person possessing or
 15 28 applying for the card.
 15 29    The bill provides that the department may adopt emergency
 15 30 rules and the rules shall be effective immediately upon filing
 15 31 unless a later date is specified in the rules.
 15 32    The bill provides that a medical cannabis registration card
 15 33 issued under Code chapter 124D (medical cannabidiol Act) prior
 15 34 to July 1, 2015, shall remain effective and continues in effect
 15 35 as issued for the 12=month period following its issuance.

 11 34                           EXPLANATION
 11 35 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
 12  1 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
 12  2    This bill creates the medical cannabis Act and provides for
 12  3 criminal penalties and fees.
 12  4    The bill amends Code section 124.401, relating to prohibited
 12  5 acts involving controlled substances, to provide that it is
 12  6 lawful for a person to knowingly or intentionally recommend,
 12  7 possess, use, dispense, deliver, transport, or administer
 12  8 medical cannabis if the recommendation, possession, use,
 12  9 dispensing, delivery, transporting, or administering is in
 12 10 accordance with the provisions of the bill.
 12 11    The bill establishes new Code chapter 124E, the medical
 12 12 cannabis Act, to allow for the medical use of cannabis for
 12 13 alleviating symptoms caused by debilitating medical conditions
 12 14 and their medical treatments.  The bill defines "medical use
 12 15 of cannabis" to mean the acquisition, possession, cultivation,
 12 16 manufacture, use, delivery, transfer, or transportation of
 12 17 cannabis or related paraphernalia to treat or alleviate a
 12 18 registered qualified patient's debilitating medical condition
 12 19 as defined in the bill. The bill defines "cannabis" to mean
 12 20 all parts of the plants of the genus cannabis, whether growing
 12 21 or not; the seeds thereof; the resin extracted from any part of
 12 22 the plant; and every compound, manufacture, salt, derivative,
 12 23 mixture, or preparation of the plant, its seeds, or resin,
 12 24 including tetrahydrocannabinols.  It does not include the
 12 25 mature stalks of the plant; fiber produced from the stalks; oil
 12 26 or cake made from the seeds of the plant; any other compound,
 12 27 manufacture, salt, derivative, mixture, or preparation of the
 12 28 mature stalks, except the resin extracted therefrom; fiber;
 12 29 or oil or cake or the sterilized seed of the plant which is
 12 30 incapable of germination (see also Code section 124.101(19)).
 12 31    The bill provides that a qualified patient who has been
 12 32 issued and who possesses a registry identification card issued
 12 33 by the Iowa department of public health shall not be subject to
 12 34 arrest or prosecution, civil or criminal penalty, or the denial
 12 35 of any right or privilege for the medical use of cannabis if
 13  1 the quantity of cannabis does not exceed an adequate supply.
 13  2 The bill also provides the same immunity for a qualified
 13  3 patient's primary caregiver and for a licensed producer.
 13  4    The bill defines a qualified patient as a resident of this
 13  5 state who has been diagnosed by a practitioner as having a
 13  6 debilitating medical condition as specified in the bill and
 13  7 who has received written certification by a practitioner and
 13  8 has been issued a registry identification card pursuant to the
 13  9 new Code chapter. A qualified patient may designate one or
 13 10 more primary caregivers. A primary caregiver is defined as a
 13 11 resident of this state, at least 18 years old, who has been
 13 12 designated by the patient's practitioner or a person having
 13 13 legal custody of the qualified patient as being necessary to
 13 14 take responsibility for managing the well=being of a qualified
 13 15 patient with respect to the medical use of cannabis pursuant
 13 16 to the provisions of the bill.  "Licensed producer" is defined
 13 17 as any qualified patient, primary caregiver, or nonprofit
 13 18 private entity within this state that the department of public
 13 19 health determines to be qualified to process, produce, possess,
 13 20 manufacture, distribute, dispense, deliver, and transport
 13 21 cannabis in this state under the bill.  A qualified patient or
 13 22 primary caregiver licensed as a producer shall produce no more
 13 23 than an adequate supply of cannabis for the patient's personal
 13 24 use only. "Practitioner" is defined as a person licensed in
 13 25 this state to prescribe and administer a controlled substance
 13 26 regulated under Code chapter 124.
 13 27    The bill provides that participation in the medical use of
 13 28 cannabis program by a qualified patient or primary caregiver
 13 29 does not relieve the qualified patient or primary caregiver
 13 30 from prosecution or civil penalties for activities not
 13 31 authorized under the bill, liability for damages or criminal
 13 32 prosecution arising out of the operation of a vehicle while
 13 33 under the influence of cannabis, or other criminal prosecution
 13 34 or civil penalties for possession or use of cannabis in certain
 13 35 situations.  A qualified patient or primary caregiver who
 14  1 makes a fraudulent representation to a law enforcement officer
 14  2 about the person's medical use of cannabis to avoid arrest
 14  3 or prosecution for a cannabis=related offense is guilty of a
 14  4 simple misdemeanor.
 14  5    The bill directs the department of public health to
 14  6 establish a medical cannabis advisory board no later
 14  7 than August 15, 2016, consisting of eight practitioners
 14  8 representing the fields of neurology, pain management, medical
 14  9 oncology, psychiatry, infectious disease, family medicine,
 14 10 and gynecology.  The practitioners shall be nationally
 14 11 board=certified in their area of specialty and knowledgeable
 14 12 about the medical use of cannabis and appointed by the
 14 13 director of public health from a list proposed by the Iowa
 14 14 medical society.  The advisory board is required to review
 14 15 and recommend to the department for approval additional
 14 16 debilitating medical conditions for persons who would benefit
 14 17 from the medical use of cannabis, accept and review petitions
 14 18 to add medical conditions, medical treatments, or diseases
 14 19 to the list of debilitating medical conditions that qualify
 14 20 for the medical use of cannabis, meet at least twice per year
 14 21 to conduct public hearings and to evaluate petitions to add
 14 22 medical conditions, medical treatments, or diseases to the
 14 23 list of debilitating medical conditions that qualify for the
 14 24 medical use of cannabis, issue recommendations concerning rules
 14 25 to be adopted for the issuance of registry identification
 14 26 cards, recommend quantities of cannabis that are necessary
 14 27 to constitute an adequate supply for qualified patients and
 14 28 primary caregivers, and review actions of the department in
 14 29 approving or denying registry identification card applications.
 14 30    The department is required to adopt rules pursuant to
 14 31 Code chapter 17A to establish and implement a medical use of
 14 32 cannabis program consistent with the purpose of the bill no
 14 33 later than October 1, 2016. The department is authorized to
 14 34 adopt emergency rules pursuant to Code chapter 17A.  The rules
 14 35 shall relate to applications for new and renewal registry
 15  1 identification cards and for qualified patients and primary
 15  2 caregivers, the amount of cannabis that constitutes an adequate
 15  3 supply for purposes of the bill, including amounts for topical
 15  4 treatments, criteria and procedures for including additional
 15  5 medical conditions, medical treatments, or diseases as
 15  6 debilitating medical conditions that qualify for the medical
 15  7 use of cannabis, requirements for the licensure of producers,
 15  8 the development of a distribution system for medical cannabis
 15  9 within this state, the establishment of application and renewal
 15 10 fees that generate revenues sufficient to offset all expenses
 15 11 of implementing and administering the new Code chapter, and
 15 12 specify and implement procedures that address public safety
 15 13 including security procedures and product quality, safety,
 15 14 and labeling. The department is to maintain confidential
 15 15 information collected pursuant to the bill and provide for the
 15 16 release of certain information to certain persons under certain
 15 17 confidentiality guidelines and to submit an annual report to
 15 18 the general assembly by January 15 of each year.
 15 19    The department is also required to issue a registry
 15 20 identification card to a qualified patient and any primary
 15 21 caregiver named in the qualified patient's application, if the
 15 22 qualified patient and each primary caregiver submit certain
 15 23 information in an application to the department.  The bill
 15 24 provides that possession of or application for a registry
 15 25 identification card shall not constitute probable cause or
 15 26 give rise to reasonable suspicion for a governmental agency
 15 27 to search the person or property of the person possessing or
 15 28 applying for the card.
 15 29    The bill provides that the department may adopt emergency
 15 30 rules and the rules shall be effective immediately upon filing
 15 31 unless a later date is specified in the rules.
 15 32    The bill provides that a medical cannabis registration card
 15 33 issued under Code chapter 124D (medical cannabidiol Act) prior

 11 34                           EXPLANATION
 11 35 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
 12  1 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
 12  2    This bill creates the medical cannabis Act and provides for
 12  3 criminal penalties and fees.
 12  4    The bill amends Code section 124.401, relating to prohibited
 12  5 acts involving controlled substances, to provide that it is
 12  6 lawful for a person to knowingly or intentionally recommend,
 12  7 possess, use, dispense, deliver, transport, or administer
 12  8 medical cannabis if the recommendation, possession, use,
 12  9 dispensing, delivery, transporting, or administering is in
 12 10 accordance with the provisions of the bill.
 12 11    The bill establishes new Code chapter 124E, the medical
 12 12 cannabis Act, to allow for the medical use of cannabis for
 12 13 alleviating symptoms caused by debilitating medical conditions
 12 14 and their medical treatments.  The bill defines "medical use
 12 15 of cannabis" to mean the acquisition, possession, cultivation,
 12 16 manufacture, use, delivery, transfer, or transportation of
 12 17 cannabis or related paraphernalia to treat or alleviate a
 12 18 registered qualified patient's debilitating medical condition
 12 19 as defined in the bill. The bill defines "cannabis" to mean
 12 20 all parts of the plants of the genus cannabis, whether growing
 12 21 or not; the seeds thereof; the resin extracted from any part of
 12 22 the plant; and every compound, manufacture, salt, derivative,
 12 23 mixture, or preparation of the plant, its seeds, or resin,
 12 24 including tetrahydrocannabinols.  It does not include the
 12 25 mature stalks of the plant; fiber produced from the stalks; oil
 12 26 or cake made from the seeds of the plant; any other compound,
 12 27 manufacture, salt, derivative, mixture, or preparation of the
 12 28 mature stalks, except the resin extracted therefrom; fiber;
 12 29 or oil or cake or the sterilized seed of the plant which is
 12 30 incapable of germination (see also Code section 124.101(19)).
 12 31    The bill provides that a qualified patient who has been
 12 32 issued and who possesses a registry identification card issued
 12 33 by the Iowa department of public health shall not be subject to
 12 34 arrest or prosecution, civil or criminal penalty, or the denial
 12 35 of any right or privilege for the medical use of cannabis if
 13  1 the quantity of cannabis does not exceed an adequate supply.
 13  2 The bill also provides the same immunity for a qualified
 13  3 patient's primary caregiver and for a licensed producer.
 13  4    The bill defines a qualified patient as a resident of this
 13  5 state who has been diagnosed by a practitioner as having a
 13  6 debilitating medical condition as specified in the bill and
 13  7 who has received written certification by a practitioner and
 13  8 has been issued a registry identification card pursuant to the
 13  9 new Code chapter. A qualified patient may designate one or
 13 10 more primary caregivers. A primary caregiver is defined as a
 13 11 resident of this state, at least 18 years old, who has been
 13 12 designated by the patient's practitioner or a person having
 13 13 legal custody of the qualified patient as being necessary to
 13 14 take responsibility for managing the well=being of a qualified
 13 15 patient with respect to the medical use of cannabis pursuant
 13 16 to the provisions of the bill.  "Licensed producer" is defined
 13 17 as any qualified patient, primary caregiver, or nonprofit
 13 18 private entity within this state that the department of public
 13 19 health determines to be qualified to process, produce, possess,
 13 20 manufacture, distribute, dispense, deliver, and transport
 13 21 cannabis in this state under the bill.  A qualified patient or
 13 22 primary caregiver licensed as a producer shall produce no more
 13 23 than an adequate supply of cannabis for the patient's personal
 13 24 use only. "Practitioner" is defined as a person licensed in
 13 25 this state to prescribe and administer a controlled substance
 13 26 regulated under Code chapter 124.
 13 27    The bill provides that participation in the medical use of
 13 28 cannabis program by a qualified patient or primary caregiver
 13 29 does not relieve the qualified patient or primary caregiver
 13 30 from prosecution or civil penalties for activities not
 13 31 authorized under the bill, liability for damages or criminal
 13 32 prosecution arising out of the operation of a vehicle while
 13 33 under the influence of cannabis, or other criminal prosecution
 13 34 or civil penalties for possession or use of cannabis in certain
 13 35 situations.  A qualified patient or primary caregiver who
 14  1 makes a fraudulent representation to a law enforcement officer
 14  2 about the person's medical use of cannabis to avoid arrest
 14  3 or prosecution for a cannabis=related offense is guilty of a
 14  4 simple misdemeanor.
 14  5    The bill directs the department of public health to
 14  6 establish a medical cannabis advisory board no later
 14  7 than August 15, 2016, consisting of eight practitioners
 14  8 representing the fields of neurology, pain management, medical
 14  9 oncology, psychiatry, infectious disease, family medicine,
 14 10 and gynecology.  The practitioners shall be nationally
 14 11 board=certified in their area of specialty and knowledgeable
 14 12 about the medical use of cannabis and appointed by the
 14 13 director of public health from a list proposed by the Iowa
 14 14 medical society.  The advisory board is required to review
 14 15 and recommend to the department for approval additional
 14 16 debilitating medical conditions for persons who would benefit
 14 17 from the medical use of cannabis, accept and review petitions
 14 18 to add medical conditions, medical treatments, or diseases
 14 19 to the list of debilitating medical conditions that qualify
 14 20 for the medical use of cannabis, meet at least twice per year
 14 21 to conduct public hearings and to evaluate petitions to add
 14 22 medical conditions, medical treatments, or diseases to the
 14 23 list of debilitating medical conditions that qualify for the
 14 24 medical use of cannabis, issue recommendations concerning rules
 14 25 to be adopted for the issuance of registry identification
 14 26 cards, recommend quantities of cannabis that are necessary
 14 27 to constitute an adequate supply for qualified patients and
 14 28 primary caregivers, and review actions of the department in
 14 29 approving or denying registry identification card applications.
 14 30    The department is required to adopt rules pursuant to
 14 31 Code chapter 17A to establish and implement a medical use of
 14 32 cannabis program consistent with the purpose of the bill no
 14 33 later than October 1, 2016. The department is authorized to
 14 34 adopt emergency rules pursuant to Code chapter 17A.  The rules
 14 35 shall relate to applications for new and renewal registry
 15  1 identification cards and for qualified patients and primary
 15  2 caregivers, the amount of cannabis that constitutes an adequate
 15  3 supply for purposes of the bill, including amounts for topical
 15  4 treatments, criteria and procedures for including additional
 15  5 medical conditions, medical treatments, or diseases as
 15  6 debilitating medical conditions that qualify for the medical
 15  7 use of cannabis, requirements for the licensure of producers,
 15  8 the development of a distribution system for medical cannabis
 15  9 within this state, the establishment of application and renewal
 15 10 fees that generate revenues sufficient to offset all expenses
 15 11 of implementing and administering the new Code chapter, and
 15 12 specify and implement procedures that address public safety
 15 13 including security procedures and product quality, safety,
 15 14 and labeling. The department is to maintain confidential
 15 15 information collected pursuant to the bill and provide for the
 15 16 release of certain information to certain persons under certain
 15 17 confidentiality guidelines and to submit an annual report to
 15 18 the general assembly by January 15 of each year.
 15 19    The department is also required to issue a registry
 15 20 identification card to a qualified patient and any primary
 15 21 caregiver named in the qualified patient's application, if the
 15 22 qualified patient and each primary caregiver submit certain
 15 23 information in an application to the department.  The bill
 15 24 provides that possession of or application for a registry
 15 25 identification card shall not constitute probable cause or
 15 26 give rise to reasonable suspicion for a governmental agency
 15 27 to search the person or property of the person possessing or
 15 28 applying for the card.
 15 29    The bill provides that the department may adopt emergency
 15 30 rules and the rules shall be effective immediately upon filing
 15 31 unless a later date is specified in the rules.
 15 32    The bill provides that a medical cannabis registration card
 15 33 issued under Code chapter 124D (medical cannabidiol Act) prior
 15 34 to July 1, 2015, shall remain effective and continues in effect
 15 35 as issued for the 12=month period following its issuance.

 11 34                           EXPLANATION
 11 35 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
 12  1 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
 12  2    This bill creates the medical cannabis Act and provides for
 12  3 criminal penalties and fees.
 12  4    The bill amends Code section 124.401, relating to prohibited
 12  5 acts involving controlled substances, to provide that it is
 12  6 lawful for a person to knowingly or intentionally recommend,
 12  7 possess, use, dispense, deliver, transport, or administer
 12  8 medical cannabis if the recommendation, possession, use,
 12  9 dispensing, delivery, transporting, or administering is in
 12 10 accordance with the provisions of the bill.
 12 11    The bill establishes new Code chapter 124E, the medical
 12 12 cannabis Act, to allow for the medical use of cannabis for
 12 13 alleviating symptoms caused by debilitating medical conditions
 12 14 and their medical treatments.  The bill defines "medical use
 12 15 of cannabis" to mean the acquisition, possession, cultivation,
 12 16 manufacture, use, delivery, transfer, or transportation of
 12 17 cannabis or related paraphernalia to treat or alleviate a
 12 18 registered qualified patient's debilitating medical condition
 12 19 as defined in the bill. The bill defines "cannabis" to mean
 12 20 all parts of the plants of the genus cannabis, whether growing
 12 21 or not; the seeds thereof; the resin extracted from any part of
 12 22 the plant; and every compound, manufacture, salt, derivative,
 12 23 mixture, or preparation of the plant, its seeds, or resin,
 12 24 including tetrahydrocannabinols.  It does not include the
 12 25 mature stalks of the plant; fiber produced from the stalks; oil
 12 26 or cake made from the seeds of the plant; any other compound,
 12 27 manufacture, salt, derivative, mixture, or preparation of the
 12 28 mature stalks, except the resin extracted therefrom; fiber;
 12 29 or oil or cake or the sterilized seed of the plant which is
 12 30 incapable of germination (see also Code section 124.101(19)).
 12 31    The bill provides that a qualified patient who has been
 12 32 issued and who possesses a registry identification card issued
 12 33 by the Iowa department of public health shall not be subject to
 12 34 arrest or prosecution, civil or criminal penalty, or the denial
 12 35 of any right or privilege for the medical use of cannabis if
 13  1 the quantity of cannabis does not exceed an adequate supply.
 13  2 The bill also provides the same immunity for a qualified
 13  3 patient's primary caregiver and for a licensed producer.
 13  4    The bill defines a qualified patient as a resident of this
 13  5 state who has been diagnosed by a practitioner as having a
 13  6 debilitating medical condition as specified in the bill and
 13  7 who has received written certification by a practitioner and
 13  8 has been issued a registry identification card pursuant to the
 13  9 new Code chapter. A qualified patient may designate one or
 13 10 more primary caregivers. A primary caregiver is defined as a
 13 11 resident of this state, at least 18 years old, who has been
 13 12 designated by the patient's practitioner or a person having
 13 13 legal custody of the qualified patient as being necessary to
 13 14 take responsibility for managing the well=being of a qualified
 13 15 patient with respect to the medical use of cannabis pursuant
 13 16 to the provisions of the bill.  "Licensed producer" is defined
 13 17 as any qualified patient, primary caregiver, or nonprofit
 13 18 private entity within this state that the department of public
 13 19 health determines to be qualified to process, produce, possess,
 13 20 manufacture, distribute, dispense, deliver, and transport
 13 21 cannabis in this state under the bill.  A qualified patient or
 13 22 primary caregiver licensed as a producer shall produce no more
 13 23 than an adequate supply of cannabis for the patient's personal
 13 24 use only. "Practitioner" is defined as a person licensed in
 13 25 this state to prescribe and administer a controlled substance
 13 26 regulated under Code chapter 124.
 13 27    The bill provides that participation in the medical use of
 13 28 cannabis program by a qualified patient or primary caregiver
 13 29 does not relieve the qualified patient or primary caregiver
 13 30 from prosecution or civil penalties for activities not
 13 31 authorized under the bill, liability for damages or criminal
 13 32 prosecution arising out of the operation of a vehicle while
 13 33 under the influence of cannabis, or other criminal prosecution
 13 34 or civil penalties for possession or use of cannabis in certain
 13 35 situations.  A qualified patient or primary caregiver who
 14  1 makes a fraudulent representation to a law enforcement officer
 14  2 about the person's medical use of cannabis to avoid arrest
 14  3 or prosecution for a cannabis=related offense is guilty of a
 14  4 simple misdemeanor.
 14  5    The bill directs the department of public health to
 14  6 establish a medical cannabis advisory board no later
 14  7 than August 15, 2016, consisting of eight practitioners
 14  8 representing the fields of neurology, pain management, medical
 14  9 oncology, psychiatry, infectious disease, family medicine,
 14 10 and gynecology.  The practitioners shall be nationally
 14 11 board=certified in their area of specialty and knowledgeable
 14 12 about the medical use of cannabis and appointed by the
 14 13 director of public health from a list proposed by the Iowa
 14 14 medical society.  The advisory board is required to review
 14 15 and recommend to the department for approval additional
 14 16 debilitating medical conditions for persons who would benefit
 14 17 from the medical use of cannabis, accept and review petitions
 14 18 to add medical conditions, medical treatments, or diseases
 14 19 to the list of debilitating medical conditions that qualify
 14 20 for the medical use of cannabis, meet at least twice per year
 14 21 to conduct public hearings and to evaluate petitions to add
 14 22 medical conditions, medical treatments, or diseases to the
 14 23 list of debilitating medical conditions that qualify for the
 14 24 medical use of cannabis, issue recommendations concerning rules
 14 25 to be adopted for the issuance of registry identification
 14 26 cards, recommend quantities of cannabis that are necessary
 14 27 to constitute an adequate supply for qualified patients and
 14 28 primary caregivers, and review actions of the department in
 14 29 approving or denying registry identification card applications.
 14 30    The department is required to adopt rules pursuant to
 14 31 Code chapter 17A to establish and implement a medical use of
 14 32 cannabis program consistent with the purpose of the bill no
 14 33 later than October 1, 2016. The department is authorized to
 14 34 adopt emergency rules pursuant to Code chapter 17A.  The rules
 14 35 shall relate to applications for new and renewal registry
 15  1 identification cards and for qualified patients and primary
 15  2 caregivers, the amount of cannabis that constitutes an adequate
 15  3 supply for purposes of the bill, including amounts for topical
 15  4 treatments, criteria and procedures for including additional
 15  5 medical conditions, medical treatments, or diseases as
 15  6 debilitating medical conditions that qualify for the medical
 15  7 use of cannabis, requirements for the licensure of producers,
 15  8 the development of a distribution system for medical cannabis
 15  9 within this state, the establishment of application and renewal
 15 10 fees that generate revenues sufficient to offset all expenses
 15 11 of implementing and administering the new Code chapter, and
 15 12 specify and implement procedures that address public safety
 15 13 including security procedures and product quality, safety,
 15 14 and labeling. The department is to maintain confidential
 15 15 information collected pursuant to the bill and provide for the
 15 16 release of certain information to certain persons under certain
 15 17 confidentiality guidelines and to submit an annual report to
 15 18 the general assembly by January 15 of each year.
 15 19    The department is also required to issue a registry
 15 20 identification card to a qualified patient and any primary
 15 21 caregiver named in the qualified patient's application, if the
 15 22 qualified patient and each primary caregiver submit certain
 15 23 information in an application to the department.  The bill
 15 24 provides that possession of or application for a registry
 15 25 identification card shall not constitute probable cause or
 15 26 give rise to reasonable suspicion for a governmental agency
 15 27 to search the person or property of the person possessing or
 15 28 applying for the card.
 15 29    The bill provides that the department may adopt emergency
 15 30 rules and the rules shall be effective immediately upon filing
 15 31 unless a later date is specified in the rules.
 15 32    The bill provides that a medical cannabis registration card
 15 33 issued under Code chapter 124D (medical cannabidiol Act) prior

 15 35 as issued for the 12=month period following its issuance.

 12 21 or not; the seeds thereof; the resin extracted from any part of
 12 22 the plant; and every compound, manufacture, salt, derivative,
 12 23 mixture, or preparation of the plant, its seeds, or resin,
 12 24 including tetrahydrocannabinols.  It does not include the
 12 25 mature stalks of the plant; fiber produced from the stalks; oil
 12 26 or cake made from the seeds of the plant; any other compound,
 12 27 manufacture, salt, derivative, mixture, or preparation of the
 12 28 mature stalks, except the resin extracted therefrom; fiber;
 12 29 or oil or cake or the sterilized seed of the plant which is
 12 30 incapable of germination (see also Code section 124.101(19)).
 12 31    The bill provides that a qualified patient who has been
 12 32 issued and who possesses a registry identification card issued
 12 33 by the Iowa department of public health shall not be subject to
 12 34 arrest or prosecution, civil or criminal penalty, or the denial
 12 35 of any right or privilege for the medical use of cannabis if
 13  1 the quantity of cannabis does not exceed an adequate supply.
 13  2 The bill also provides the same immunity for a qualified
 13  3 patient's primary caregiver and for a licensed producer.
 13  4    The bill defines a qualified patient as a resident of this
 13  5 state who has been diagnosed by a practitioner as having a
 13  6 debilitating medical condition as specified in the bill and
 13  7 who has received written certification by a practitioner and
 13  8 has been issued a registry identification card pursuant to the
 13  9 new Code chapter. A qualified patient may designate one or
 13 10 more primary caregivers. A primary caregiver is defined as a
 13 11 resident of this state, at least 18 years old, who has been
 13 12 designated by the patient's practitioner or a person having
 13 13 legal custody of the qualified patient as being necessary to
 13 14 take responsibility for managing the well=being of a qualified
 13 15 patient with respect to the medical use of cannabis pursuant
 13 16 to the provisions of the bill.  "Licensed producer" is defined
 13 17 as any qualified patient, primary caregiver, or nonprofit
 13 18 private entity within this state that the department of public
 13 19 health determines to be qualified to process, produce, possess,
 13 20 manufacture, distribute, dispense, deliver, and transport
 13 21 cannabis in this state under the bill.  A qualified patient or
 13 22 primary caregiver licensed as a producer shall produce no more
 13 23 than an adequate supply of cannabis for the patient's personal
 13 24 use only. "Practitioner" is defined as a person licensed in
 13 25 this state to prescribe and administer a controlled substance
 13 26 regulated under Code chapter 124.
 13 27    The bill provides that participation in the medical use of
 13 28 cannabis program by a qualified patient or primary caregiver
 13 29 does not relieve the qualified patient or primary caregiver
 13 30 from prosecution or civil penalties for activities not
 13 31 authorized under the bill, liability for damages or criminal
 13 32 prosecution arising out of the operation of a vehicle while
 13 33 under the influence of cannabis, or other criminal prosecution
 13 34 or civil penalties for possession or use of cannabis in certain
 13 35 situations.  A qualified patient or primary caregiver who
 14  1 makes a fraudulent representation to a law enforcement officer
 14  2 about the person's medical use of cannabis to avoid arrest
 14  3 or prosecution for a cannabis=related offense is guilty of a
 14  4 simple misdemeanor.
 14  5    The bill directs the department of public health to
 14  6 establish a medical cannabis advisory board no later
 14  7 than August 15, 2016, consisting of eight practitioners
 14  8 representing the fields of neurology, pain management, medical
 14  9 oncology, psychiatry, infectious disease, family medicine,
 14 10 and gynecology.  The practitioners shall be nationally
 14 11 board=certified in their area of specialty and knowledgeable
 14 12 about the medical use of cannabis and appointed by the
 14 13 director of public health from a list proposed by the Iowa
 14 14 medical society.  The advisory board is required to review
 14 15 and recommend to the department for approval additional
 14 16 debilitating medical conditions for persons who would benefit
 14 17 from the medical use of cannabis, accept and review petitions
 14 18 to add medical conditions, medical treatments, or diseases
 14 19 to the list of debilitating medical conditions that qualify
 14 20 for the medical use of cannabis, meet at least twice per year
 14 21 to conduct public hearings and to evaluate petitions to add
 14 22 medical conditions, medical treatments, or diseases to the
 14 23 list of debilitating medical conditions that qualify for the
 14 24 medical use of cannabis, issue recommendations concerning rules
 14 25 to be adopted for the issuance of registry identification
 14 26 cards, recommend quantities of cannabis that are necessary
 14 27 to constitute an adequate supply for qualified patients and
 14 28 primary caregivers, and review actions of the department in
 14 29 approving or denying registry identification card applications.
 14 30    The department is required to adopt rules pursuant to
 14 31 Code chapter 17A to establish and implement a medical use of
 14 32 cannabis program consistent with the purpose of the bill no
 14 33 later than October 1, 2016. The department is authorized to
 14 34 adopt emergency rules pursuant to Code chapter 17A.  The rules
 14 35 shall relate to applications for new and renewal registry
 15  1 identification cards and for qualified patients and primary
 15  2 caregivers, the amount of cannabis that constitutes an adequate
 15  3 supply for purposes of the bill, including amounts for topical
 15  4 treatments, criteria and procedures for including additional
 15  5 medical conditions, medical treatments, or diseases as
 15  6 debilitating medical conditions that qualify for the medical
 15  7 use of cannabis, requirements for the licensure of producers,
 15  8 the development of a distribution system for medical cannabis
 15  9 within this state, the establishment of application and renewal
 15 10 fees that generate revenues sufficient to offset all expenses
 15 11 of implementing and administering the new Code chapter, and
 15 12 specify and implement procedures that address public safety
 15 13 including security procedures and product quality, safety,
 15 14 and labeling. The department is to maintain confidential
 15 15 information collected pursuant to the bill and provide for the
 15 16 release of certain information to certain persons under certain
 15 17 confidentiality guidelines and to submit an annual report to
 15 18 the general assembly by January 15 of each year.
 15 19    The department is also required to issue a registry
 15 20 identification card to a qualified patient and any primary
 15 21 caregiver named in the qualified patient's application, if the
 15 22 qualified patient and each primary caregiver submit certain
 15 23 information in an application to the department.  The bill
 15 24 provides that possession of or application for a registry
 15 25 identification card shall not constitute probable cause or
 15 26 give rise to reasonable suspicion for a governmental agency
 15 27 to search the person or property of the person possessing or
 15 28 applying for the card.
 15 29    The bill provides that the department may adopt emergency
 15 30 rules and the rules shall be effective immediately upon filing
 15 31 unless a later date is specified in the rules.
 15 32    The bill provides that a medical cannabis registration card
 15 33 issued under Code chapter 124D (medical cannabidiol Act) prior

 14  2 about the person's medical use of cannabis to avoid arrest
 14  3 or prosecution for a cannabis=related offense is guilty of a
 14  4 simple misdemeanor.

 11 35 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
 12  1 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
 12  2    This bill creates the medical cannabis Act and provides for
 12  3 criminal penalties and fees.
 12  4    The bill amends Code section 124.401, relating to prohibited
 12  5 acts involving controlled substances, to provide that it is
 12  6 lawful for a person to knowingly or intentionally recommend,
 12  7 possess, use, dispense, deliver, transport, or administer
 12  8 medical cannabis if the recommendation, possession, use,
 12  9 dispensing, delivery, transporting, or administering is in
 12 10 accordance with the provisions of the bill.
 12 11    The bill establishes new Code chapter 124E, the medical
 12 12 cannabis Act, to allow for the medical use of cannabis for
 12 13 alleviating symptoms caused by debilitating medical conditions
 12 14 and their medical treatments.  The bill defines "medical use
 12 15 of cannabis" to mean the acquisition, possession, cultivation,
 12 16 manufacture, use, delivery, transfer, or transportation of
 12 17 cannabis or related paraphernalia to treat or alleviate a
 12 18 registered qualified patient's debilitating medical condition
 12 19 as defined in the bill. The bill defines "cannabis" to mean
 12 20 all parts of the plants of the genus cannabis, whether growing
 12 21 or not; the seeds thereof; the resin extracted from any part of
 12 22 the plant; and every compound, manufacture, salt, derivative,
 12 23 mixture, or preparation of the plant, its seeds, or resin,
 12 24 including tetrahydrocannabinols.  It does not include the
 12 25 mature stalks of the plant; fiber produced from the stalks; oil
 12 26 or cake made from the seeds of the plant; any other compound,
 12 27 manufacture, salt, derivative, mixture, or preparation of the
 12 28 mature stalks, except the resin extracted therefrom; fiber;
 12 29 or oil or cake or the sterilized seed of the plant which is
 12 30 incapable of germination (see also Code section 124.101(19)).
 12 31    The bill provides that a qualified patient who has been
 12 32 issued and who possesses a registry identification card issued
 12 33 by the Iowa department of public health shall not be subject to
 12 34 arrest or prosecution, civil or criminal penalty, or the denial
 12 35 of any right or privilege for the medical use of cannabis if
 13  1 the quantity of cannabis does not exceed an adequate supply.
 13  2 The bill also provides the same immunity for a qualified
 13  3 patient's primary caregiver and for a licensed producer.
 13  4    The bill defines a qualified patient as a resident of this
 13  5 state who has been diagnosed by a practitioner as having a
 13  6 debilitating medical condition as specified in the bill and
 13  7 who has received written certification by a practitioner and
 13  8 has been issued a registry identification card pursuant to the
 13  9 new Code chapter. A qualified patient may designate one or
 13 10 more primary caregivers. A primary caregiver is defined as a
 13 11 resident of this state, at least 18 years old, who has been
 13 12 designated by the patient's practitioner or a person having
 13 13 legal custody of the qualified patient as being necessary to
 13 14 take responsibility for managing the well=being of a qualified
 13 15 patient with respect to the medical use of cannabis pursuant
 13 16 to the provisions of the bill.  "Licensed producer" is defined
 13 17 as any qualified patient, primary caregiver, or nonprofit

 13 23 than an adequate supply of cannabis for the patient's personal
 13 24 use only. "Practitioner" is defined as a person licensed in
 13 25 this state to prescribe and administer a controlled substance
 13 26 regulated under Code chapter 124.
 13 27    The bill provides that participation in the medical use of

 13 29 does not relieve the qualified patient or primary caregiver
 13 30 from prosecution or civil penalties for activities not
 13 31 authorized under the bill, liability for damages or criminal
 13 32 prosecution arising out of the operation of a vehicle while
 13 33 under the influence of cannabis, or other criminal prosecution
 13 34 or civil penalties for possession or use of cannabis in certain

 14  1 makes a fraudulent representation to a law enforcement officer
 14  2 about the person's medical use of cannabis to avoid arrest
 14  3 or prosecution for a cannabis=related offense is guilty of a
 14  4 simple misdemeanor.
 14  5    The bill directs the department of public health to
 14  6 establish a medical cannabis advisory board no later

 14 21 to conduct public hearings and to evaluate petitions to add
 14 22 medical conditions, medical treatments, or diseases to the
 14 23 list of debilitating medical conditions that qualify for the
 14 24 medical use of cannabis, issue recommendations concerning rules
 14 25 to be adopted for the issuance of registry identification
 14 26 cards, recommend quantities of cannabis that are necessary
 14 27 to constitute an adequate supply for qualified patients and
 14 28 primary caregivers, and review actions of the department in
 14 29 approving or denying registry identification card applications.
 14 30    The department is required to adopt rules pursuant to
 14 31 Code chapter 17A to establish and implement a medical use of
 14 32 cannabis program consistent with the purpose of the bill no

 15 11 of implementing and administering the new Code chapter, and
 15 12 specify and implement procedures that address public safety
 15 13 including security procedures and product quality, safety,

 15 16 release of certain information to certain persons under certain
 15 17 confidentiality guidelines and to submit an annual report to
 15 18 the general assembly by January 15 of each year.
 15 19    The department is also required to issue a registry
 15 20 identification card to a qualified patient and any primary
 15 21 caregiver named in the qualified patient's application, if the
 15 22 qualified patient and each primary caregiver submit certain
 15 23 information in an application to the department.  The bill
 15 24 provides that possession of or application for a registry
 15 25 identification card shall not constitute probable cause or
 15 26 give rise to reasonable suspicion for a governmental agency
 15 27 to search the person or property of the person possessing or
 15 28 applying for the card.

 11 34                           EXPLANATION
 11 35 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
 12  1 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
 12  2    This bill creates the medical cannabis Act and provides for
 12  3 criminal penalties and fees.
 12  4    The bill amends Code section 124.401, relating to prohibited
 12  5 acts involving controlled substances, to provide that it is
 12  6 lawful for a person to knowingly or intentionally recommend,
 12  7 possess, use, dispense, deliver, transport, or administer
 12  8 medical cannabis if the recommendation, possession, use,
 12  9 dispensing, delivery, transporting, or administering is in
 12 10 accordance with the provisions of the bill.
 12 11    The bill establishes new Code chapter 124E, the medical
 12 12 cannabis Act, to allow for the medical use of cannabis for
 12 13 alleviating symptoms caused by debilitating medical conditions
 12 14 and their medical treatments.  The bill defines "medical use
 12 15 of cannabis" to mean the acquisition, possession, cultivation,
 12 16 manufacture, use, delivery, transfer, or transportation of
 12 17 cannabis or related paraphernalia to treat or alleviate a
 12 18 registered qualified patient's debilitating medical condition
 12 19 as defined in the bill. The bill defines "cannabis" to mean
 12 20 all parts of the plants of the genus cannabis, whether growing
 12 21 or not; the seeds thereof; the resin extracted from any part of
 12 22 the plant; and every compound, manufacture, salt, derivative,
 12 23 mixture, or preparation of the plant, its seeds, or resin,
 12 24 including tetrahydrocannabinols.  It does not include the
 12 25 mature stalks of the plant; fiber produced from the stalks; oil
 12 26 or cake made from the seeds of the plant; any other compound,
 12 27 manufacture, salt, derivative, mixture, or preparation of the
 12 28 mature stalks, except the resin extracted therefrom; fiber;
 12 29 or oil or cake or the sterilized seed of the plant which is
 12 30 incapable of germination (see also Code section 124.101(19)).
 12 31    The bill provides that a qualified patient who has been
 12 32 issued and who possesses a registry identification card issued
 12 33 by the Iowa department of public health shall not be subject to
 12 34 arrest or prosecution, civil or criminal penalty, or the denial
 12 35 of any right or privilege for the medical use of cannabis if
 13  1 the quantity of cannabis does not exceed an adequate supply.
 13  2 The bill also provides the same immunity for a qualified
 13  3 patient's primary caregiver and for a licensed producer.
 13  4    The bill defines a qualified patient as a resident of this
 13  5 state who has been diagnosed by a practitioner as having a
 13  6 debilitating medical condition as specified in the bill and
 13  7 who has received written certification by a practitioner and
 13  8 has been issued a registry identification card pursuant to the
 13  9 new Code chapter. A qualified patient may designate one or
 13 10 more primary caregivers. A primary caregiver is defined as a
 13 11 resident of this state, at least 18 years old, who has been
 13 12 designated by the patient's practitioner or a person having
 13 13 legal custody of the qualified patient as being necessary to
 13 14 take responsibility for managing the well=being of a qualified
 13 15 patient with respect to the medical use of cannabis pursuant
 13 16 to the provisions of the bill.  "Licensed producer" is defined
 13 17 as any qualified patient, primary caregiver, or nonprofit
 13 18 private entity within this state that the department of public
 13 19 health determines to be qualified to process, produce, possess,
 13 20 manufacture, distribute, dispense, deliver, and transport
 13 21 cannabis in this state under the bill.  A qualified patient or
 13 22 primary caregiver licensed as a producer shall produce no more
 13 23 than an adequate supply of cannabis for the patient's personal
 13 24 use only. "Practitioner" is defined as a person licensed in
 13 25 this state to prescribe and administer a controlled substance
 13 26 regulated under Code chapter 124.
 13 27    The bill provides that participation in the medical use of
 13 28 cannabis program by a qualified patient or primary caregiver
 13 29 does not relieve the qualified patient or primary caregiver
 13 30 from prosecution or civil penalties for activities not
 13 31 authorized under the bill, liability for damages or criminal
 13 32 prosecution arising out of the operation of a vehicle while
 13 33 under the influence of cannabis, or other criminal prosecution
 13 34 or civil penalties for possession or use of cannabis in certain
 13 35 situations.  A qualified patient or primary caregiver who
 14  1 makes a fraudulent representation to a law enforcement officer
 14  2 about the person's medical use of cannabis to avoid arrest
 14  3 or prosecution for a cannabis=related offense is guilty of a
 14  4 simple misdemeanor.
 14  5    The bill directs the department of public health to
 14  6 establish a medical cannabis advisory board no later
 14  7 than August 15, 2016, consisting of eight practitioners
 14  8 representing the fields of neurology, pain management, medical
 14  9 oncology, psychiatry, infectious disease, family medicine,
 14 10 and gynecology.  The practitioners shall be nationally
 14 11 board=certified in their area of specialty and knowledgeable
 14 12 about the medical use of cannabis and appointed by the
 14 13 director of public health from a list proposed by the Iowa
 14 14 medical society.  The advisory board is required to review
 14 15 and recommend to the department for approval additional
 14 16 debilitating medical conditions for persons who would benefit
 14 17 from the medical use of cannabis, accept and review petitions
 14 18 to add medical conditions, medical treatments, or diseases
 14 19 to the list of debilitating medical conditions that qualify
 14 20 for the medical use of cannabis, meet at least twice per year
 14 21 to conduct public hearings and to evaluate petitions to add
 14 22 medical conditions, medical treatments, or diseases to the
 14 23 list of debilitating medical conditions that qualify for the
 14 24 medical use of cannabis, issue recommendations concerning rules
 14 25 to be adopted for the issuance of registry identification
 14 26 cards, recommend quantities of cannabis that are necessary
 14 27 to constitute an adequate supply for qualified patients and
 14 28 primary caregivers, and review actions of the department in
 14 29 approving or denying registry identification card applications.
 14 30    The department is required to adopt rules pursuant to
 14 31 Code chapter 17A to establish and implement a medical use of
 14 32 cannabis program consistent with the purpose of the bill no
 14 33 later than October 1, 2016. The department is authorized to
 14 34 adopt emergency rules pursuant to Code chapter 17A.  The rules
 14 35 shall relate to applications for new and renewal registry
 15  1 identification cards and for qualified patients and primary
 15  2 caregivers, the amount of cannabis that constitutes an adequate
 15  3 supply for purposes of the bill, including amounts for topical
 15  4 treatments, criteria and procedures for including additional
 15  5 medical conditions, medical treatments, or diseases as
 15  6 debilitating medical conditions that qualify for the medical
 15  7 use of cannabis, requirements for the licensure of producers,
 15  8 the development of a distribution system for medical cannabis
 15  9 within this state, the establishment of application and renewal
 15 10 fees that generate revenues sufficient to offset all expenses
 15 11 of implementing and administering the new Code chapter, and
 15 12 specify and implement procedures that address public safety
 15 13 including security procedures and product quality, safety,
 15 14 and labeling. The department is to maintain confidential
 15 15 information collected pursuant to the bill and provide for the
 15 16 release of certain information to certain persons under certain
 15 17 confidentiality guidelines and to submit an annual report to
 15 18 the general assembly by January 15 of each year.
 15 19    The department is also required to issue a registry
 15 20 identification card to a qualified patient and any primary
 15 21 caregiver named in the qualified patient's application, if the
 15 22 qualified patient and each primary caregiver submit certain
 15 23 information in an application to the department.  The bill
 15 24 provides that possession of or application for a registry
 15 25 identification card shall not constitute probable cause or
 15 26 give rise to reasonable suspicion for a governmental agency
 15 27 to search the person or property of the person possessing or
 15 28 applying for the card.
 15 29    The bill provides that the department may adopt emergency
 15 30 rules and the rules shall be effective immediately upon filing

 11 34                           EXPLANATION
 11 35 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
 12  1 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
 12  2    This bill creates the medical cannabis Act and provides for
 12  3 criminal penalties and fees.
 12  4    The bill amends Code section 124.401, relating to prohibited
 12  5 acts involving controlled substances, to provide that it is
 12  6 lawful for a person to knowingly or intentionally recommend,
 12  7 possess, use, dispense, deliver, transport, or administer
 12  8 medical cannabis if the recommendation, possession, use,
 12  9 dispensing, delivery, transporting, or administering is in
 12 10 accordance with the provisions of the bill.
 12 11    The bill establishes new Code chapter 124E, the medical
 12 12 cannabis Act, to allow for the medical use of cannabis for
 12 13 alleviating symptoms caused by debilitating medical conditions
 12 14 and their medical treatments.  The bill defines "medical use
 12 15 of cannabis" to mean the acquisition, possession, cultivation,
 12 16 manufacture, use, delivery, transfer, or transportation of
 12 17 cannabis or related paraphernalia to treat or alleviate a
 12 18 registered qualified patient's debilitating medical condition
 12 19 as defined in the bill. The bill defines "cannabis" to mean
 12 20 all parts of the plants of the genus cannabis, whether growing
 12 21 or not; the seeds thereof; the resin extracted from any part of
 12 22 the plant; and every compound, manufacture, salt, derivative,
 12 23 mixture, or preparation of the plant, its seeds, or resin,
 12 24 including tetrahydrocannabinols.  It does not include the
 12 25 mature stalks of the plant; fiber produced from the stalks; oil
 12 26 or cake made from the seeds of the plant; any other compound,
 12 27 manufacture, salt, derivative, mixture, or preparation of the
 12 28 mature stalks, except the resin extracted therefrom; fiber;
 12 29 or oil or cake or the sterilized seed of the plant which is
 12 30 incapable of germination (see also Code section 124.101(19)).
 12 31    The bill provides that a qualified patient who has been
 12 32 issued and who possesses a registry identification card issued
 12 33 by the Iowa department of public health shall not be subject to
 12 34 arrest or prosecution, civil or criminal penalty, or the denial
 12 35 of any right or privilege for the medical use of cannabis if
 13  1 the quantity of cannabis does not exceed an adequate supply.
 13  2 The bill also provides the same immunity for a qualified
 13  3 patient's primary caregiver and for a licensed producer.
 13  4    The bill defines a qualified patient as a resident of this
 13  5 state who has been diagnosed by a practitioner as having a
 13  6 debilitating medical condition as specified in the bill and
 13  7 who has received written certification by a practitioner and
 13  8 has been issued a registry identification card pursuant to the
 13  9 new Code chapter. A qualified patient may designate one or
 13 10 more primary caregivers. A primary caregiver is defined as a
 13 11 resident of this state, at least 18 years old, who has been
 13 12 designated by the patient's practitioner or a person having
 13 13 legal custody of the qualified patient as being necessary to
 13 14 take responsibility for managing the well=being of a qualified
 13 15 patient with respect to the medical use of cannabis pursuant
 13 16 to the provisions of the bill.  "Licensed producer" is defined
 13 17 as any qualified patient, primary caregiver, or nonprofit
 13 18 private entity within this state that the department of public
 13 19 health determines to be qualified to process, produce, possess,
 13 20 manufacture, distribute, dispense, deliver, and transport
 13 21 cannabis in this state under the bill.  A qualified patient or
 13 22 primary caregiver licensed as a producer shall produce no more
 13 23 than an adequate supply of cannabis for the patient's personal
 13 24 use only. "Practitioner" is defined as a person licensed in
 13 25 this state to prescribe and administer a controlled substance
 13 26 regulated under Code chapter 124.
 13 27    The bill provides that participation in the medical use of
 13 28 cannabis program by a qualified patient or primary caregiver
 13 29 does not relieve the qualified patient or primary caregiver
 13 30 from prosecution or civil penalties for activities not
 13 31 authorized under the bill, liability for damages or criminal
 13 32 prosecution arising out of the operation of a vehicle while
 13 33 under the influence of cannabis, or other criminal prosecution
 13 34 or civil penalties for possession or use of cannabis in certain
 13 35 situations.  A qualified patient or primary caregiver who
 14  1 makes a fraudulent representation to a law enforcement officer
 14  2 about the person's medical use of cannabis to avoid arrest
 14  3 or prosecution for a cannabis=related offense is guilty of a
 14  4 simple misdemeanor.
 14  5    The bill directs the department of public health to
 14  6 establish a medical cannabis advisory board no later
 14  7 than August 15, 2016, consisting of eight practitioners
 14  8 representing the fields of neurology, pain management, medical
 14  9 oncology, psychiatry, infectious disease, family medicine,
 14 10 and gynecology.  The practitioners shall be nationally
 14 11 board=certified in their area of specialty and knowledgeable
 14 12 about the medical use of cannabis and appointed by the
 14 13 director of public health from a list proposed by the Iowa
 14 14 medical society.  The advisory board is required to review
 14 15 and recommend to the department for approval additional
 14 16 debilitating medical conditions for persons who would benefit
 14 17 from the medical use of cannabis, accept and review petitions
 14 18 to add medical conditions, medical treatments, or diseases
 14 19 to the list of debilitating medical conditions that qualify
 14 20 for the medical use of cannabis, meet at least twice per year
 14 21 to conduct public hearings and to evaluate petitions to add
 14 22 medical conditions, medical treatments, or diseases to the
 14 23 list of debilitating medical conditions that qualify for the
 14 24 medical use of cannabis, issue recommendations concerning rules
 14 25 to be adopted for the issuance of registry identification
 14 26 cards, recommend quantities of cannabis that are necessary
 14 27 to constitute an adequate supply for qualified patients and
 14 28 primary caregivers, and review actions of the department in
 14 29 approving or denying registry identification card applications.
 14 30    The department is required to adopt rules pursuant to
 14 31 Code chapter 17A to establish and implement a medical use of
 14 32 cannabis program consistent with the purpose of the bill no
 14 33 later than October 1, 2016. The department is authorized to
 14 34 adopt emergency rules pursuant to Code chapter 17A.  The rules
 14 35 shall relate to applications for new and renewal registry
 15  1 identification cards and for qualified patients and primary
 15  2 caregivers, the amount of cannabis that constitutes an adequate
 15  3 supply for purposes of the bill, including amounts for topical
 15  4 treatments, criteria and procedures for including additional
 15  5 medical conditions, medical treatments, or diseases as
 15  6 debilitating medical conditions that qualify for the medical
 15  7 use of cannabis, requirements for the licensure of producers,
 15  8 the development of a distribution system for medical cannabis
 15  9 within this state, the establishment of application and renewal
 15 10 fees that generate revenues sufficient to offset all expenses
 15 11 of implementing and administering the new Code chapter, and
 15 12 specify and implement procedures that address public safety
 15 13 including security procedures and product quality, safety,
 15 14 and labeling. The department is to maintain confidential
 15 15 information collected pursuant to the bill and provide for the
 15 16 release of certain information to certain persons under certain
 15 17 confidentiality guidelines and to submit an annual report to
 15 18 the general assembly by January 15 of each year.
 15 19    The department is also required to issue a registry
 15 20 identification card to a qualified patient and any primary
 15 21 caregiver named in the qualified patient's application, if the
 15 22 qualified patient and each primary caregiver submit certain
 15 23 information in an application to the department.  The bill
 15 24 provides that possession of or application for a registry
 15 25 identification card shall not constitute probable cause or
 15 26 give rise to reasonable suspicion for a governmental agency
 15 27 to search the person or property of the person possessing or
 15 28 applying for the card.
 15 29    The bill provides that the department may adopt emergency
 15 30 rules and the rules shall be effective immediately upon filing
 15 31 unless a later date is specified in the rules.
 15 32    The bill provides that a medical cannabis registration card
 15 33 issued under Code chapter 124D (medical cannabidiol Act) prior

 15 35 as issued for the 12=month period following its issuance.

 12 13 alleviating symptoms caused by debilitating medical conditions
 12 14 and their medical treatments.  The bill defines "medical use
 12 15 of cannabis" to mean the acquisition, possession, cultivation,
 12 16 manufacture, use, delivery, transfer, or transportation of
 12 17 cannabis or related paraphernalia to treat or alleviate a
 12 18 registered qualified patient's debilitating medical condition
 12 19 as defined in the bill. The bill defines "cannabis" to mean
 12 20 all parts of the plants of the genus cannabis, whether growing
 12 21 or not; the seeds thereof; the resin extracted from any part of
 12 22 the plant; and every compound, manufacture, salt, derivative,
 12 23 mixture, or preparation of the plant, its seeds, or resin,
 12 24 including tetrahydrocannabinols.  It does not include the
 12 25 mature stalks of the plant; fiber produced from the stalks; oil
 12 26 or cake made from the seeds of the plant; any other compound,
 12 27 manufacture, salt, derivative, mixture, or preparation of the
 12 28 mature stalks, except the resin extracted therefrom; fiber;
 12 29 or oil or cake or the sterilized seed of the plant which is
 12 30 incapable of germination (see also Code section 124.101(19)).
 12 31    The bill provides that a qualified patient who has been
 12 32 issued and who possesses a registry identification card issued
 12 33 by the Iowa department of public health shall not be subject to
 12 34 arrest or prosecution, civil or criminal penalty, or the denial
 12 35 of any right or privilege for the medical use of cannabis if
 13  1 the quantity of cannabis does not exceed an adequate supply.
 13  2 The bill also provides the same immunity for a qualified
 13  3 patient's primary caregiver and for a licensed producer.
 13  4    The bill defines a qualified patient as a resident of this
 13  5 state who has been diagnosed by a practitioner as having a
 13  6 debilitating medical condition as specified in the bill and
 13  7 who has received written certification by a practitioner and
 13  8 has been issued a registry identification card pursuant to the
 13  9 new Code chapter. A qualified patient may designate one or
 13 10 more primary caregivers. A primary caregiver is defined as a
 13 11 resident of this state, at least 18 years old, who has been
 13 12 designated by the patient's practitioner or a person having
 13 13 legal custody of the qualified patient as being necessary to
 13 14 take responsibility for managing the well=being of a qualified
 13 15 patient with respect to the medical use of cannabis pursuant
 13 16 to the provisions of the bill.  "Licensed producer" is defined
 13 17 as any qualified patient, primary caregiver, or nonprofit
 13 18 private entity within this state that the department of public
 13 19 health determines to be qualified to process, produce, possess,
 13 20 manufacture, distribute, dispense, deliver, and transport
 13 21 cannabis in this state under the bill.  A qualified patient or
 13 22 primary caregiver licensed as a producer shall produce no more
 13 23 than an adequate supply of cannabis for the patient's personal
 13 24 use only. "Practitioner" is defined as a person licensed in
 13 25 this state to prescribe and administer a controlled substance
 13 26 regulated under Code chapter 124.
 13 27    The bill provides that participation in the medical use of
 13 28 cannabis program by a qualified patient or primary caregiver
 13 29 does not relieve the qualified patient or primary caregiver
 13 30 from prosecution or civil penalties for activities not
 13 31 authorized under the bill, liability for damages or criminal
 13 32 prosecution arising out of the operation of a vehicle while
 13 33 under the influence of cannabis, or other criminal prosecution
 13 34 or civil penalties for possession or use of cannabis in certain
 13 35 situations.  A qualified patient or primary caregiver who
 14  1 makes a fraudulent representation to a law enforcement officer
 14  2 about the person's medical use of cannabis to avoid arrest
 14  3 or prosecution for a cannabis=related offense is guilty of a
 14  4 simple misdemeanor.
 14  5    The bill directs the department of public health to
 14  6 establish a medical cannabis advisory board no later
 14  7 than August 15, 2016, consisting of eight practitioners
 14  8 representing the fields of neurology, pain management, medical
 14  9 oncology, psychiatry, infectious disease, family medicine,
 14 10 and gynecology.  The practitioners shall be nationally
 14 11 board=certified in their area of specialty and knowledgeable
 14 12 about the medical use of cannabis and appointed by the
 14 13 director of public health from a list proposed by the Iowa
 14 14 medical society.  The advisory board is required to review
 14 15 and recommend to the department for approval additional
 14 16 debilitating medical conditions for persons who would benefit
 14 17 from the medical use of cannabis, accept and review petitions
 14 18 to add medical conditions, medical treatments, or diseases
 14 19 to the list of debilitating medical conditions that qualify
 14 20 for the medical use of cannabis, meet at least twice per year
 14 21 to conduct public hearings and to evaluate petitions to add
 14 22 medical conditions, medical treatments, or diseases to the
 14 23 list of debilitating medical conditions that qualify for the
 14 24 medical use of cannabis, issue recommendations concerning rules
 14 25 to be adopted for the issuance of registry identification
 14 26 cards, recommend quantities of cannabis that are necessary
 14 27 to constitute an adequate supply for qualified patients and
 14 28 primary caregivers, and review actions of the department in
 14 29 approving or denying registry identification card applications.
 14 30    The department is required to adopt rules pursuant to
 14 31 Code chapter 17A to establish and implement a medical use of
 14 32 cannabis program consistent with the purpose of the bill no
 14 33 later than October 1, 2016. The department is authorized to
 14 34 adopt emergency rules pursuant to Code chapter 17A.  The rules
 14 35 shall relate to applications for new and renewal registry
 15  1 identification cards and for qualified patients and primary
 15  2 caregivers, the amount of cannabis that constitutes an adequate
 15  3 supply for purposes of the bill, including amounts for topical
 15  4 treatments, criteria and procedures for including additional
 15  5 medical conditions, medical treatments, or diseases as
 15  6 debilitating medical conditions that qualify for the medical
 15  7 use of cannabis, requirements for the licensure of producers,
 15  8 the development of a distribution system for medical cannabis
 15  9 within this state, the establishment of application and renewal
 15 10 fees that generate revenues sufficient to offset all expenses
 15 11 of implementing and administering the new Code chapter, and
 15 12 specify and implement procedures that address public safety
 15 13 including security procedures and product quality, safety,
 15 14 and labeling. The department is to maintain confidential
 15 15 information collected pursuant to the bill and provide for the
 15 16 release of certain information to certain persons under certain
 15 17 confidentiality guidelines and to submit an annual report to
 15 18 the general assembly by January 15 of each year.
 15 19    The department is also required to issue a registry
 15 20 identification card to a qualified patient and any primary
 15 21 caregiver named in the qualified patient's application, if the
 15 22 qualified patient and each primary caregiver submit certain
 15 23 information in an application to the department.  The bill
 15 24 provides that possession of or application for a registry
 15 25 identification card shall not constitute probable cause or
 15 26 give rise to reasonable suspicion for a governmental agency
 15 27 to search the person or property of the person possessing or
 15 28 applying for the card.
 15 29    The bill provides that the department may adopt emergency
 15 30 rules and the rules shall be effective immediately upon filing
 15 31 unless a later date is specified in the rules.
 15 32    The bill provides that a medical cannabis registration card
 15 33 issued under Code chapter 124D (medical cannabidiol Act) prior

 13 32 prosecution arising out of the operation of a vehicle while
 13 33 under the influence of cannabis, or other criminal prosecution
 13 34 or civil penalties for possession or use of cannabis in certain

 14  1 makes a fraudulent representation to a law enforcement officer
 14  2 about the person's medical use of cannabis to avoid arrest
 14  3 or prosecution for a cannabis=related offense is guilty of a
 14  4 simple misdemeanor.
 14  5    The bill directs the department of public health to

 14 11 board=certified in their area of specialty and knowledgeable
 14 12 about the medical use of cannabis and appointed by the
 14 13 director of public health from a list proposed by the Iowa
 14 14 medical society.  The advisory board is required to review
 14 15 and recommend to the department for approval additional
 14 16 debilitating medical conditions for persons who would benefit
 14 17 from the medical use of cannabis, accept and review petitions

 14 24 medical use of cannabis, issue recommendations concerning rules
 14 25 to be adopted for the issuance of registry identification
 14 26 cards, recommend quantities of cannabis that are necessary
 14 27 to constitute an adequate supply for qualified patients and
 14 28 primary caregivers, and review actions of the department in
 14 29 approving or denying registry identification card applications.
 14 30    The department is required to adopt rules pursuant to
 14 31 Code chapter 17A to establish and implement a medical use of
 14 32 cannabis program consistent with the purpose of the bill no
 14 33 later than October 1, 2016. The department is authorized to

 15 15 information collected pursuant to the bill and provide for the
 15 16 release of certain information to certain persons under certain
 15 17 confidentiality guidelines and to submit an annual report to
 15 18 the general assembly by January 15 of each year.

 15 21 caregiver named in the qualified patient's application, if the
 15 22 qualified patient and each primary caregiver submit certain

 15 24 provides that possession of or application for a registry
 15 25 identification card shall not constitute probable cause or
 15 26 give rise to reasonable suspicion for a governmental agency
 15 27 to search the person or property of the person possessing or

 15 29    The bill provides that the department may adopt emergency
 15 30 rules and the rules shall be effective immediately upon filing

 11 34                           EXPLANATION
 11 35 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
 12  1 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
 12  2    This bill creates the medical cannabis Act and provides for
 12  3 criminal penalties and fees.
 12  4    The bill amends Code section 124.401, relating to prohibited
 12  5 acts involving controlled substances, to provide that it is
 12  6 lawful for a person to knowingly or intentionally recommend,
 12  7 possess, use, dispense, deliver, transport, or administer
 12  8 medical cannabis if the recommendation, possession, use,
 12  9 dispensing, delivery, transporting, or administering is in
 12 10 accordance with the provisions of the bill.
 12 11    The bill establishes new Code chapter 124E, the medical
 12 12 cannabis Act, to allow for the medical use of cannabis for
 12 13 alleviating symptoms caused by debilitating medical conditions
 12 14 and their medical treatments.  The bill defines "medical use
 12 15 of cannabis" to mean the acquisition, possession, cultivation,
 12 16 manufacture, use, delivery, transfer, or transportation of
 12 17 cannabis or related paraphernalia to treat or alleviate a
 12 18 registered qualified patient's debilitating medical condition
 12 19 as defined in the bill. The bill defines "cannabis" to mean
 12 20 all parts of the plants of the genus cannabis, whether growing
 12 21 or not; the seeds thereof; the resin extracted from any part of
 12 22 the plant; and every compound, manufacture, salt, derivative,
 12 23 mixture, or preparation of the plant, its seeds, or resin,
 12 24 including tetrahydrocannabinols.  It does not include the
 12 25 mature stalks of the plant; fiber produced from the stalks; oil
 12 26 or cake made from the seeds of the plant; any other compound,
 12 27 manufacture, salt, derivative, mixture, or preparation of the
 12 28 mature stalks, except the resin extracted therefrom; fiber;
 12 29 or oil or cake or the sterilized seed of the plant which is
 12 30 incapable of germination (see also Code section 124.101(19)).
 12 31    The bill provides that a qualified patient who has been
 12 32 issued and who possesses a registry identification card issued
 12 33 by the Iowa department of public health shall not be subject to
 12 34 arrest or prosecution, civil or criminal penalty, or the denial
 12 35 of any right or privilege for the medical use of cannabis if
 13  1 the quantity of cannabis does not exceed an adequate supply.
 13  2 The bill also provides the same immunity for a qualified
 13  3 patient's primary caregiver and for a licensed producer.
 13  4    The bill defines a qualified patient as a resident of this
 13  5 state who has been diagnosed by a practitioner as having a
 13  6 debilitating medical condition as specified in the bill and
 13  7 who has received written certification by a practitioner and
 13  8 has been issued a registry identification card pursuant to the
 13  9 new Code chapter. A qualified patient may designate one or
 13 10 more primary caregivers. A primary caregiver is defined as a
 13 11 resident of this state, at least 18 years old, who has been
 13 12 designated by the patient's practitioner or a person having
 13 13 legal custody of the qualified patient as being necessary to
 13 14 take responsibility for managing the well=being of a qualified
 13 15 patient with respect to the medical use of cannabis pursuant
 13 16 to the provisions of the bill.  "Licensed producer" is defined
 13 17 as any qualified patient, primary caregiver, or nonprofit
 13 18 private entity within this state that the department of public
 13 19 health determines to be qualified to process, produce, possess,
 13 20 manufacture, distribute, dispense, deliver, and transport
 13 21 cannabis in this state under the bill.  A qualified patient or
 13 22 primary caregiver licensed as a producer shall produce no more
 13 23 than an adequate supply of cannabis for the patient's personal
 13 24 use only. "Practitioner" is defined as a person licensed in
 13 25 this state to prescribe and administer a controlled substance
 13 26 regulated under Code chapter 124.
 13 27    The bill provides that participation in the medical use of
 13 28 cannabis program by a qualified patient or primary caregiver
 13 29 does not relieve the qualified patient or primary caregiver
 13 30 from prosecution or civil penalties for activities not
 13 31 authorized under the bill, liability for damages or criminal
 13 32 prosecution arising out of the operation of a vehicle while
 13 33 under the influence of cannabis, or other criminal prosecution
 13 34 or civil penalties for possession or use of cannabis in certain
 13 35 situations.  A qualified patient or primary caregiver who
 14  1 makes a fraudulent representation to a law enforcement officer
 14  2 about the person's medical use of cannabis to avoid arrest
 14  3 or prosecution for a cannabis=related offense is guilty of a
 14  4 simple misdemeanor.
 14  5    The bill directs the department of public health to
 14  6 establish a medical cannabis advisory board no later
 14  7 than August 15, 2016, consisting of eight practitioners
 14  8 representing the fields of neurology, pain management, medical
 14  9 oncology, psychiatry, infectious disease, family medicine,
 14 10 and gynecology.  The practitioners shall be nationally
 14 11 board=certified in their area of specialty and knowledgeable
 14 12 about the medical use of cannabis and appointed by the
 14 13 director of public health from a list proposed by the Iowa
 14 14 medical society.  The advisory board is required to review
 14 15 and recommend to the department for approval additional
 14 16 debilitating medical conditions for persons who would benefit
 14 17 from the medical use of cannabis, accept and review petitions
 14 18 to add medical conditions, medical treatments, or diseases
 14 19 to the list of debilitating medical conditions that qualify
 14 20 for the medical use of cannabis, meet at least twice per year
 14 21 to conduct public hearings and to evaluate petitions to add
 14 22 medical conditions, medical treatments, or diseases to the
 14 23 list of debilitating medical conditions that qualify for the
 14 24 medical use of cannabis, issue recommendations concerning rules
 14 25 to be adopted for the issuance of registry identification
 14 26 cards, recommend quantities of cannabis that are necessary
 14 27 to constitute an adequate supply for qualified patients and
 14 28 primary caregivers, and review actions of the department in
 14 29 approving or denying registry identification card applications.
 14 30    The department is required to adopt rules pursuant to
 14 31 Code chapter 17A to establish and implement a medical use of
 14 32 cannabis program consistent with the purpose of the bill no
 14 33 later than October 1, 2016. The department is authorized to
 14 34 adopt emergency rules pursuant to Code chapter 17A.  The rules
 14 35 shall relate to applications for new and renewal registry
 15  1 identification cards and for qualified patients and primary
 15  2 caregivers, the amount of cannabis that constitutes an adequate
 15  3 supply for purposes of the bill, including amounts for topical
 15  4 treatments, criteria and procedures for including additional
 15  5 medical conditions, medical treatments, or diseases as
 15  6 debilitating medical conditions that qualify for the medical
 15  7 use of cannabis, requirements for the licensure of producers,
 15  8 the development of a distribution system for medical cannabis
 15  9 within this state, the establishment of application and renewal
 15 10 fees that generate revenues sufficient to offset all expenses
 15 11 of implementing and administering the new Code chapter, and
 15 12 specify and implement procedures that address public safety
 15 13 including security procedures and product quality, safety,
 15 14 and labeling. The department is to maintain confidential
 15 15 information collected pursuant to the bill and provide for the
 15 16 release of certain information to certain persons under certain
 15 17 confidentiality guidelines and to submit an annual report to
 15 18 the general assembly by January 15 of each year.
 15 19    The department is also required to issue a registry
 15 20 identification card to a qualified patient and any primary
 15 21 caregiver named in the qualified patient's application, if the
 15 22 qualified patient and each primary caregiver submit certain
 15 23 information in an application to the department.  The bill
 15 24 provides that possession of or application for a registry
 15 25 identification card shall not constitute probable cause or
 15 26 give rise to reasonable suspicion for a governmental agency
 15 27 to search the person or property of the person possessing or
 15 28 applying for the card.
 15 29    The bill provides that the department may adopt emergency
 15 30 rules and the rules shall be effective immediately upon filing
 15 31 unless a later date is specified in the rules.
 15 32    The bill provides that a medical cannabis registration card
 15 33 issued under Code chapter 124D (medical cannabidiol Act) prior
 15 34 to July 1, 2015, shall remain effective and continues in effect

 11 29 2016, remains effective and continues in effect as issued for
 11 30 the twelve=month period following its issuance. This Act does
 11 31 not preclude the permit holder from seeking to renew the permit
 11 32 under this Act prior to the expiration of the twelve=month
 11 33 period.
 11 34                           EXPLANATION
 11 35 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
 12  1 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
 12  2    This bill creates the medical cannabis Act and provides for
 12  3 criminal penalties and fees.
 12  4    The bill amends Code section 124.401, relating to prohibited
 12  5 acts involving controlled substances, to provide that it is
 12  6 lawful for a person to knowingly or intentionally recommend,
 12  7 possess, use, dispense, deliver, transport, or administer
 12  8 medical cannabis if the recommendation, possession, use,
 12  9 dispensing, delivery, transporting, or administering is in
 12 10 accordance with the provisions of the bill.
 12 11    The bill establishes new Code chapter 124E, the medical
 12 12 cannabis Act, to allow for the medical use of cannabis for
 12 13 alleviating symptoms caused by debilitating medical conditions
 12 14 and their medical treatments.  The bill defines "medical use
 12 15 of cannabis" to mean the acquisition, possession, cultivation,
 12 16 manufacture, use, delivery, transfer, or transportation of
 12 17 cannabis or related paraphernalia to treat or alleviate a
 12 18 registered qualified patient's debilitating medical condition
 12 19 as defined in the bill. The bill defines "cannabis" to mean
 12 20 all parts of the plants of the genus cannabis, whether growing
 12 21 or not; the seeds thereof; the resin extracted from any part of
 12 22 the plant; and every compound, manufacture, salt, derivative,
 12 23 mixture, or preparation of the plant, its seeds, or resin,
 12 24 including tetrahydrocannabinols.  It does not include the
 12 25 mature stalks of the plant; fiber produced from the stalks; oil
 12 26 or cake made from the seeds of the plant; any other compound,
 12 27 manufacture, salt, derivative, mixture, or preparation of the
 12 28 mature stalks, except the resin extracted therefrom; fiber;
 12 29 or oil or cake or the sterilized seed of the plant which is
 12 30 incapable of germination (see also Code section 124.101(19)).
 12 31    The bill provides that a qualified patient who has been
 12 32 issued and who possesses a registry identification card issued
 12 33 by the Iowa department of public health shall not be subject to
 12 34 arrest or prosecution, civil or criminal penalty, or the denial
 12 35 of any right or privilege for the medical use of cannabis if
 13  1 the quantity of cannabis does not exceed an adequate supply.
 13  2 The bill also provides the same immunity for a qualified
 13  3 patient's primary caregiver and for a licensed producer.
 13  4    The bill defines a qualified patient as a resident of this
 13  5 state who has been diagnosed by a practitioner as having a
 13  6 debilitating medical condition as specified in the bill and
 13  7 who has received written certification by a practitioner and
 13  8 has been issued a registry identification card pursuant to the
 13  9 new Code chapter. A qualified patient may designate one or
 13 10 more primary caregivers. A primary caregiver is defined as a
 13 11 resident of this state, at least 18 years old, who has been
 13 12 designated by the patient's practitioner or a person having
 13 13 legal custody of the qualified patient as being necessary to
 13 14 take responsibility for managing the well=being of a qualified
 13 15 patient with respect to the medical use of cannabis pursuant
 13 16 to the provisions of the bill.  "Licensed producer" is defined
 13 17 as any qualified patient, primary caregiver, or nonprofit
 13 18 private entity within this state that the department of public
 13 19 health determines to be qualified to process, produce, possess,
 13 20 manufacture, distribute, dispense, deliver, and transport
 13 21 cannabis in this state under the bill.  A qualified patient or
 13 22 primary caregiver licensed as a producer shall produce no more
 13 23 than an adequate supply of cannabis for the patient's personal
 13 24 use only. "Practitioner" is defined as a person licensed in
 13 25 this state to prescribe and administer a controlled substance
 13 26 regulated under Code chapter 124.
 13 27    The bill provides that participation in the medical use of
 13 28 cannabis program by a qualified patient or primary caregiver
 13 29 does not relieve the qualified patient or primary caregiver
 13 30 from prosecution or civil penalties for activities not
 13 31 authorized under the bill, liability for damages or criminal
 13 32 prosecution arising out of the operation of a vehicle while
 13 33 under the influence of cannabis, or other criminal prosecution
 13 34 or civil penalties for possession or use of cannabis in certain
 13 35 situations.  A qualified patient or primary caregiver who
 14  1 makes a fraudulent representation to a law enforcement officer
 14  2 about the person's medical use of cannabis to avoid arrest
 14  3 or prosecution for a cannabis=related offense is guilty of a
 14  4 simple misdemeanor.
 14  5    The bill directs the department of public health to
 14  6 establish a medical cannabis advisory board no later
 14  7 than August 15, 2016, consisting of eight practitioners
 14  8 representing the fields of neurology, pain management, medical
 14  9 oncology, psychiatry, infectious disease, family medicine,
 14 10 and gynecology.  The practitioners shall be nationally
 14 11 board=certified in their area of specialty and knowledgeable
 14 12 about the medical use of cannabis and appointed by the
 14 13 director of public health from a list proposed by the Iowa
 14 14 medical society.  The advisory board is required to review
 14 15 and recommend to the department for approval additional
 14 16 debilitating medical conditions for persons who would benefit
 14 17 from the medical use of cannabis, accept and review petitions
 14 18 to add medical conditions, medical treatments, or diseases
 14 19 to the list of debilitating medical conditions that qualify
 14 20 for the medical use of cannabis, meet at least twice per year
 14 21 to conduct public hearings and to evaluate petitions to add
 14 22 medical conditions, medical treatments, or diseases to the
 14 23 list of debilitating medical conditions that qualify for the
 14 24 medical use of cannabis, issue recommendations concerning rules
 14 25 to be adopted for the issuance of registry identification
 14 26 cards, recommend quantities of cannabis that are necessary
 14 27 to constitute an adequate supply for qualified patients and
 14 28 primary caregivers, and review actions of the department in
 14 29 approving or denying registry identification card applications.
 14 30    The department is required to adopt rules pursuant to
 14 31 Code chapter 17A to establish and implement a medical use of
 14 32 cannabis program consistent with the purpose of the bill no
 14 33 later than October 1, 2016. The department is authorized to
 14 34 adopt emergency rules pursuant to Code chapter 17A.  The rules
 14 35 shall relate to applications for new and renewal registry
 15  1 identification cards and for qualified patients and primary
 15  2 caregivers, the amount of cannabis that constitutes an adequate
 15  3 supply for purposes of the bill, including amounts for topical
 15  4 treatments, criteria and procedures for including additional
 15  5 medical conditions, medical treatments, or diseases as
 15  6 debilitating medical conditions that qualify for the medical
 15  7 use of cannabis, requirements for the licensure of producers,
 15  8 the development of a distribution system for medical cannabis
 15  9 within this state, the establishment of application and renewal
 15 10 fees that generate revenues sufficient to offset all expenses
 15 11 of implementing and administering the new Code chapter, and
 15 12 specify and implement procedures that address public safety
 15 13 including security procedures and product quality, safety,
 15 14 and labeling. The department is to maintain confidential
 15 15 information collected pursuant to the bill and provide for the
 15 16 release of certain information to certain persons under certain
 15 17 confidentiality guidelines and to submit an annual report to
 15 18 the general assembly by January 15 of each year.
 15 19    The department is also required to issue a registry
 15 20 identification card to a qualified patient and any primary
 15 21 caregiver named in the qualified patient's application, if the
 15 22 qualified patient and each primary caregiver submit certain
 15 23 information in an application to the department.  The bill
 15 24 provides that possession of or application for a registry
 15 25 identification card shall not constitute probable cause or
 15 26 give rise to reasonable suspicion for a governmental agency
 15 27 to search the person or property of the person possessing or
 15 28 applying for the card.
 15 29    The bill provides that the department may adopt emergency
 15 30 rules and the rules shall be effective immediately upon filing
 15 31 unless a later date is specified in the rules.
 15 32    The bill provides that a medical cannabis registration card
 15 33 issued under Code chapter 124D (medical cannabidiol Act) prior

 11 12 medical condition within ten days of the change.

 13  6 debilitating medical condition as specified in the bill and
 13  7 who has received written certification by a practitioner and

 13 32 prosecution arising out of the operation of a vehicle while
 13 33 under the influence of cannabis, or other criminal prosecution

 13 26 regulated under Code chapter 124.
 13 27    The bill provides that participation in the medical use of

 13 29 does not relieve the qualified patient or primary caregiver
 13 30 from prosecution or civil penalties for activities not
 13 31 authorized under the bill, liability for damages or criminal
 13 32 prosecution arising out of the operation of a vehicle while
 13 33 under the influence of cannabis, or other criminal prosecution
 13 34 or civil penalties for possession or use of cannabis in certain

 14  1 makes a fraudulent representation to a law enforcement officer
 14  2 about the person's medical use of cannabis to avoid arrest
 14  3 or prosecution for a cannabis=related offense is guilty of a
 14  4 simple misdemeanor.
 14  5    The bill directs the department of public health to
 14  6 establish a medical cannabis advisory board no later
 14  7 than August 15, 2016, consisting of eight practitioners
 14  8 representing the fields of neurology, pain management, medical

 14 11 board=certified in their area of specialty and knowledgeable
 14 12 about the medical use of cannabis and appointed by the
 14 13 director of public health from a list proposed by the Iowa
 14 14 medical society.  The advisory board is required to review
 14 15 and recommend to the department for approval additional
 14 16 debilitating medical conditions for persons who would benefit
 14 17 from the medical use of cannabis, accept and review petitions
 14 18 to add medical conditions, medical treatments, or diseases
 14 19 to the list of debilitating medical conditions that qualify
 14 20 for the medical use of cannabis, meet at least twice per year
 14 21 to conduct public hearings and to evaluate petitions to add
 14 22 medical conditions, medical treatments, or diseases to the
 14 23 list of debilitating medical conditions that qualify for the
 14 24 medical use of cannabis, issue recommendations concerning rules
 14 25 to be adopted for the issuance of registry identification
 14 26 cards, recommend quantities of cannabis that are necessary
 14 27 to constitute an adequate supply for qualified patients and
 14 28 primary caregivers, and review actions of the department in
 14 29 approving or denying registry identification card applications.
 14 30    The department is required to adopt rules pursuant to
 14 31 Code chapter 17A to establish and implement a medical use of
 14 32 cannabis program consistent with the purpose of the bill no
 14 33 later than October 1, 2016. The department is authorized to
 14 34 adopt emergency rules pursuant to Code chapter 17A.  The rules
 14 35 shall relate to applications for new and renewal registry
 15  1 identification cards and for qualified patients and primary
 15  2 caregivers, the amount of cannabis that constitutes an adequate
 15  3 supply for purposes of the bill, including amounts for topical

 15  7 use of cannabis, requirements for the licensure of producers,
 15  8 the development of a distribution system for medical cannabis
 15  9 within this state, the establishment of application and renewal
 15 10 fees that generate revenues sufficient to offset all expenses
 15 11 of implementing and administering the new Code chapter, and
 15 12 specify and implement procedures that address public safety
 15 13 including security procedures and product quality, safety,
 15 14 and labeling. The department is to maintain confidential
 15 15 information collected pursuant to the bill and provide for the
 15 16 release of certain information to certain persons under certain
 15 17 confidentiality guidelines and to submit an annual report to
 15 18 the general assembly by January 15 of each year.
 15 19    The department is also required to issue a registry
 15 20 identification card to a qualified patient and any primary
 15 21 caregiver named in the qualified patient's application, if the
 15 22 qualified patient and each primary caregiver submit certain
 15 23 information in an application to the department.  The bill
 15 24 provides that possession of or application for a registry
 15 25 identification card shall not constitute probable cause or
 15 26 give rise to reasonable suspicion for a governmental agency
 15 27 to search the person or property of the person possessing or
 15 28 applying for the card.
 15 29    The bill provides that the department may adopt emergency
 15 30 rules and the rules shall be effective immediately upon filing

 12  4    The bill amends Code section 124.401, relating to prohibited
 12  5 acts involving controlled substances, to provide that it is
 12  6 lawful for a person to knowingly or intentionally recommend,

 12 11    The bill establishes new Code chapter 124E, the medical

 12 22 the plant; and every compound, manufacture, salt, derivative,
 12 23 mixture, or preparation of the plant, its seeds, or resin,
 12 24 including tetrahydrocannabinols.  It does not include the
 12 25 mature stalks of the plant; fiber produced from the stalks; oil
 12 26 or cake made from the seeds of the plant; any other compound,
 12 27 manufacture, salt, derivative, mixture, or preparation of the

 12 29 or oil or cake or the sterilized seed of the plant which is
 12 30 incapable of germination (see also Code section 124.101(19)).
 12 31    The bill provides that a qualified patient who has been
 12 32 issued and who possesses a registry identification card issued
 12 33 by the Iowa department of public health shall not be subject to
 12 34 arrest or prosecution, civil or criminal penalty, or the denial
 12 35 of any right or privilege for the medical use of cannabis if

 13  2 The bill also provides the same immunity for a qualified
 13  3 patient's primary caregiver and for a licensed producer.
 13  4    The bill defines a qualified patient as a resident of this

 13 11 resident of this state, at least 18 years old, who has been
 13 12 designated by the patient's practitioner or a person having
 13 13 legal custody of the qualified patient as being necessary to

 13 26 regulated under Code chapter 124.
 13 27    The bill provides that participation in the medical use of

 13 32 prosecution arising out of the operation of a vehicle while
 13 33 under the influence of cannabis, or other criminal prosecution
 13 34 or civil penalties for possession or use of cannabis in certain

 14  1 makes a fraudulent representation to a law enforcement officer
 14  2 about the person's medical use of cannabis to avoid arrest
 14  3 or prosecution for a cannabis=related offense is guilty of a
 14  4 simple misdemeanor.

 11 34                           EXPLANATION
 11 35 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
 12  1 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
 12  2    This bill creates the medical cannabis Act and provides for
 12  3 criminal penalties and fees.
 12  4    The bill amends Code section 124.401, relating to prohibited
 12  5 acts involving controlled substances, to provide that it is
 12  6 lawful for a person to knowingly or intentionally recommend,
 12  7 possess, use, dispense, deliver, transport, or administer
 12  8 medical cannabis if the recommendation, possession, use,
 12  9 dispensing, delivery, transporting, or administering is in
 12 10 accordance with the provisions of the bill.
 12 11    The bill establishes new Code chapter 124E, the medical
 12 12 cannabis Act, to allow for the medical use of cannabis for
 12 13 alleviating symptoms caused by debilitating medical conditions
 12 14 and their medical treatments.  The bill defines "medical use
 12 15 of cannabis" to mean the acquisition, possession, cultivation,
 12 16 manufacture, use, delivery, transfer, or transportation of
 12 17 cannabis or related paraphernalia to treat or alleviate a
 12 18 registered qualified patient's debilitating medical condition
 12 19 as defined in the bill. The bill defines "cannabis" to mean
 12 20 all parts of the plants of the genus cannabis, whether growing
 12 21 or not; the seeds thereof; the resin extracted from any part of
 12 22 the plant; and every compound, manufacture, salt, derivative,
 12 23 mixture, or preparation of the plant, its seeds, or resin,
 12 24 including tetrahydrocannabinols.  It does not include the
 12 25 mature stalks of the plant; fiber produced from the stalks; oil
 12 26 or cake made from the seeds of the plant; any other compound,
 12 27 manufacture, salt, derivative, mixture, or preparation of the
 12 28 mature stalks, except the resin extracted therefrom; fiber;
 12 29 or oil or cake or the sterilized seed of the plant which is
 12 30 incapable of germination (see also Code section 124.101(19)).
 12 31    The bill provides that a qualified patient who has been
 12 32 issued and who possesses a registry identification card issued
 12 33 by the Iowa department of public health shall not be subject to
 12 34 arrest or prosecution, civil or criminal penalty, or the denial
 12 35 of any right or privilege for the medical use of cannabis if
 13  1 the quantity of cannabis does not exceed an adequate supply.
 13  2 The bill also provides the same immunity for a qualified
 13  3 patient's primary caregiver and for a licensed producer.
 13  4    The bill defines a qualified patient as a resident of this
 13  5 state who has been diagnosed by a practitioner as having a
 13  6 debilitating medical condition as specified in the bill and
 13  7 who has received written certification by a practitioner and
 13  8 has been issued a registry identification card pursuant to the
 13  9 new Code chapter. A qualified patient may designate one or
 13 10 more primary caregivers. A primary caregiver is defined as a
 13 11 resident of this state, at least 18 years old, who has been
 13 12 designated by the patient's practitioner or a person having
 13 13 legal custody of the qualified patient as being necessary to
 13 14 take responsibility for managing the well=being of a qualified
 13 15 patient with respect to the medical use of cannabis pursuant
 13 16 to the provisions of the bill.  "Licensed producer" is defined
 13 17 as any qualified patient, primary caregiver, or nonprofit
 13 18 private entity within this state that the department of public
 13 19 health determines to be qualified to process, produce, possess,
 13 20 manufacture, distribute, dispense, deliver, and transport
 13 21 cannabis in this state under the bill.  A qualified patient or
 13 22 primary caregiver licensed as a producer shall produce no more
 13 23 than an adequate supply of cannabis for the patient's personal
 13 24 use only. "Practitioner" is defined as a person licensed in
 13 25 this state to prescribe and administer a controlled substance
 13 26 regulated under Code chapter 124.
 13 27    The bill provides that participation in the medical use of
 13 28 cannabis program by a qualified patient or primary caregiver
 13 29 does not relieve the qualified patient or primary caregiver
 13 30 from prosecution or civil penalties for activities not
 13 31 authorized under the bill, liability for damages or criminal
 13 32 prosecution arising out of the operation of a vehicle while
 13 33 under the influence of cannabis, or other criminal prosecution
 13 34 or civil penalties for possession or use of cannabis in certain
 13 35 situations.  A qualified patient or primary caregiver who
 14  1 makes a fraudulent representation to a law enforcement officer
 14  2 about the person's medical use of cannabis to avoid arrest
 14  3 or prosecution for a cannabis=related offense is guilty of a
 14  4 simple misdemeanor.
 14  5    The bill directs the department of public health to
 14  6 establish a medical cannabis advisory board no later
 14  7 than August 15, 2016, consisting of eight practitioners
 14  8 representing the fields of neurology, pain management, medical
 14  9 oncology, psychiatry, infectious disease, family medicine,
 14 10 and gynecology.  The practitioners shall be nationally
 14 11 board=certified in their area of specialty and knowledgeable
 14 12 about the medical use of cannabis and appointed by the
 14 13 director of public health from a list proposed by the Iowa
 14 14 medical society.  The advisory board is required to review
 14 15 and recommend to the department for approval additional
 14 16 debilitating medical conditions for persons who would benefit
 14 17 from the medical use of cannabis, accept and review petitions
 14 18 to add medical conditions, medical treatments, or diseases
 14 19 to the list of debilitating medical conditions that qualify
 14 20 for the medical use of cannabis, meet at least twice per year
 14 21 to conduct public hearings and to evaluate petitions to add
 14 22 medical conditions, medical treatments, or diseases to the
 14 23 list of debilitating medical conditions that qualify for the
 14 24 medical use of cannabis, issue recommendations concerning rules
 14 25 to be adopted for the issuance of registry identification
 14 26 cards, recommend quantities of cannabis that are necessary
 14 27 to constitute an adequate supply for qualified patients and
 14 28 primary caregivers, and review actions of the department in
 14 29 approving or denying registry identification card applications.
 14 30    The department is required to adopt rules pursuant to
 14 31 Code chapter 17A to establish and implement a medical use of
 14 32 cannabis program consistent with the purpose of the bill no
 14 33 later than October 1, 2016. The department is authorized to
 14 34 adopt emergency rules pursuant to Code chapter 17A.  The rules
 14 35 shall relate to applications for new and renewal registry
 15  1 identification cards and for qualified patients and primary
 15  2 caregivers, the amount of cannabis that constitutes an adequate
 15  3 supply for purposes of the bill, including amounts for topical
 15  4 treatments, criteria and procedures for including additional
 15  5 medical conditions, medical treatments, or diseases as
 15  6 debilitating medical conditions that qualify for the medical
 15  7 use of cannabis, requirements for the licensure of producers,
 15  8 the development of a distribution system for medical cannabis
 15  9 within this state, the establishment of application and renewal
 15 10 fees that generate revenues sufficient to offset all expenses
 15 11 of implementing and administering the new Code chapter, and
 15 12 specify and implement procedures that address public safety
 15 13 including security procedures and product quality, safety,
 15 14 and labeling. The department is to maintain confidential
 15 15 information collected pursuant to the bill and provide for the
 15 16 release of certain information to certain persons under certain
 15 17 confidentiality guidelines and to submit an annual report to
 15 18 the general assembly by January 15 of each year.
 15 19    The department is also required to issue a registry
 15 20 identification card to a qualified patient and any primary
 15 21 caregiver named in the qualified patient's application, if the
 15 22 qualified patient and each primary caregiver submit certain
 15 23 information in an application to the department.  The bill
 15 24 provides that possession of or application for a registry
 15 25 identification card shall not constitute probable cause or
 15 26 give rise to reasonable suspicion for a governmental agency
 15 27 to search the person or property of the person possessing or
 15 28 applying for the card.
 15 29    The bill provides that the department may adopt emergency
 15 30 rules and the rules shall be effective immediately upon filing
 15 31 unless a later date is specified in the rules.
 15 32    The bill provides that a medical cannabis registration card
 15 33 issued under Code chapter 124D (medical cannabidiol Act) prior
 15 34 to July 1, 2015, shall remain effective and continues in effect
 15 35 as issued for the 12=month period following its issuance.

 11 33 period.
 11 34                           EXPLANATION

 12 30 incapable of germination (see also Code section 124.101(19)).
 12 31    The bill provides that a qualified patient who has been

 12 19 as defined in the bill. The bill defines "cannabis" to mean
 12 20 all parts of the plants of the genus cannabis, whether growing
 12 21 or not; the seeds thereof; the resin extracted from any part of
 12 22 the plant; and every compound, manufacture, salt, derivative,
 12 23 mixture, or preparation of the plant, its seeds, or resin,
 12 24 including tetrahydrocannabinols.  It does not include the
 12 25 mature stalks of the plant; fiber produced from the stalks; oil
 12 26 or cake made from the seeds of the plant; any other compound,

 12 29 or oil or cake or the sterilized seed of the plant which is
 12 30 incapable of germination (see also Code section 124.101(19)).
 12 31    The bill provides that a qualified patient who has been
 12 32 issued and who possesses a registry identification card issued
 12 33 by the Iowa department of public health shall not be subject to
 12 34 arrest or prosecution, civil or criminal penalty, or the denial
 12 35 of any right or privilege for the medical use of cannabis if
 13  1 the quantity of cannabis does not exceed an adequate supply.
 13  2 The bill also provides the same immunity for a qualified
 13  3 patient's primary caregiver and for a licensed producer.
 13  4    The bill defines a qualified patient as a resident of this

 13  9 new Code chapter. A qualified patient may designate one or
 13 10 more primary caregivers. A primary caregiver is defined as a
 13 11 resident of this state, at least 18 years old, who has been
 13 12 designated by the patient's practitioner or a person having
 13 13 legal custody of the qualified patient as being necessary to

 13 26 regulated under Code chapter 124.
 13 27    The bill provides that participation in the medical use of

 13 32 prosecution arising out of the operation of a vehicle while
 13 33 under the influence of cannabis, or other criminal prosecution
 13 34 or civil penalties for possession or use of cannabis in certain

 14  1 makes a fraudulent representation to a law enforcement officer
 14  2 about the person's medical use of cannabis to avoid arrest
 14  3 or prosecution for a cannabis=related offense is guilty of a
 14  4 simple misdemeanor.
 14  5    The bill directs the department of public health to

 14 11 board=certified in their area of specialty and knowledgeable
 14 12 about the medical use of cannabis and appointed by the
 14 13 director of public health from a list proposed by the Iowa
 14 14 medical society.  The advisory board is required to review
 14 15 and recommend to the department for approval additional
 14 16 debilitating medical conditions for persons who would benefit
 14 17 from the medical use of cannabis, accept and review petitions
 14 18 to add medical conditions, medical treatments, or diseases
 14 19 to the list of debilitating medical conditions that qualify
 14 20 for the medical use of cannabis, meet at least twice per year
 14 21 to conduct public hearings and to evaluate petitions to add
 14 22 medical conditions, medical treatments, or diseases to the
 14 23 list of debilitating medical conditions that qualify for the
 14 24 medical use of cannabis, issue recommendations concerning rules
 14 25 to be adopted for the issuance of registry identification
 14 26 cards, recommend quantities of cannabis that are necessary
 14 27 to constitute an adequate supply for qualified patients and
 14 28 primary caregivers, and review actions of the department in
 14 29 approving or denying registry identification card applications.
 14 30    The department is required to adopt rules pursuant to
 14 31 Code chapter 17A to establish and implement a medical use of
 14 32 cannabis program consistent with the purpose of the bill no
 14 33 later than October 1, 2016. The department is authorized to
 14 34 adopt emergency rules pursuant to Code chapter 17A.  The rules
 14 35 shall relate to applications for new and renewal registry
 15  1 identification cards and for qualified patients and primary
 15  2 caregivers, the amount of cannabis that constitutes an adequate
 15  3 supply for purposes of the bill, including amounts for topical
 15  4 treatments, criteria and procedures for including additional
 15  5 medical conditions, medical treatments, or diseases as
 15  6 debilitating medical conditions that qualify for the medical
 15  7 use of cannabis, requirements for the licensure of producers,
 15  8 the development of a distribution system for medical cannabis
 15  9 within this state, the establishment of application and renewal
 15 10 fees that generate revenues sufficient to offset all expenses
 15 11 of implementing and administering the new Code chapter, and
 15 12 specify and implement procedures that address public safety
 15 13 including security procedures and product quality, safety,
 15 14 and labeling. The department is to maintain confidential
 15 15 information collected pursuant to the bill and provide for the
 15 16 release of certain information to certain persons under certain
 15 17 confidentiality guidelines and to submit an annual report to
 15 18 the general assembly by January 15 of each year.
 15 19    The department is also required to issue a registry
 15 20 identification card to a qualified patient and any primary
 15 21 caregiver named in the qualified patient's application, if the
 15 22 qualified patient and each primary caregiver submit certain
 15 23 information in an application to the department.  The bill
 15 24 provides that possession of or application for a registry
 15 25 identification card shall not constitute probable cause or
 15 26 give rise to reasonable suspicion for a governmental agency
 15 27 to search the person or property of the person possessing or
 15 28 applying for the card.
 15 29    The bill provides that the department may adopt emergency
 15 30 rules and the rules shall be effective immediately upon filing
 15 31 unless a later date is specified in the rules.
 15 32    The bill provides that a medical cannabis registration card
 15 33 issued under Code chapter 124D (medical cannabidiol Act) prior

 11 34                           EXPLANATION
 11 35 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
 12  1 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
 12  2    This bill creates the medical cannabis Act and provides for
 12  3 criminal penalties and fees.
 12  4    The bill amends Code section 124.401, relating to prohibited
 12  5 acts involving controlled substances, to provide that it is
 12  6 lawful for a person to knowingly or intentionally recommend,
 12  7 possess, use, dispense, deliver, transport, or administer
 12  8 medical cannabis if the recommendation, possession, use,
 12  9 dispensing, delivery, transporting, or administering is in
 12 10 accordance with the provisions of the bill.
 12 11    The bill establishes new Code chapter 124E, the medical
 12 12 cannabis Act, to allow for the medical use of cannabis for
 12 13 alleviating symptoms caused by debilitating medical conditions
 12 14 and their medical treatments.  The bill defines "medical use
 12 15 of cannabis" to mean the acquisition, possession, cultivation,
 12 16 manufacture, use, delivery, transfer, or transportation of
 12 17 cannabis or related paraphernalia to treat or alleviate a
 12 18 registered qualified patient's debilitating medical condition
 12 19 as defined in the bill. The bill defines "cannabis" to mean
 12 20 all parts of the plants of the genus cannabis, whether growing
 12 21 or not; the seeds thereof; the resin extracted from any part of
 12 22 the plant; and every compound, manufacture, salt, derivative,
 12 23 mixture, or preparation of the plant, its seeds, or resin,
 12 24 including tetrahydrocannabinols.  It does not include the
 12 25 mature stalks of the plant; fiber produced from the stalks; oil
 12 26 or cake made from the seeds of the plant; any other compound,
 12 27 manufacture, salt, derivative, mixture, or preparation of the
 12 28 mature stalks, except the resin extracted therefrom; fiber;
 12 29 or oil or cake or the sterilized seed of the plant which is
 12 30 incapable of germination (see also Code section 124.101(19)).
 12 31    The bill provides that a qualified patient who has been
 12 32 issued and who possesses a registry identification card issued
 12 33 by the Iowa department of public health shall not be subject to
 12 34 arrest or prosecution, civil or criminal penalty, or the denial
 12 35 of any right or privilege for the medical use of cannabis if
 13  1 the quantity of cannabis does not exceed an adequate supply.
 13  2 The bill also provides the same immunity for a qualified
 13  3 patient's primary caregiver and for a licensed producer.
 13  4    The bill defines a qualified patient as a resident of this
 13  5 state who has been diagnosed by a practitioner as having a
 13  6 debilitating medical condition as specified in the bill and
 13  7 who has received written certification by a practitioner and
 13  8 has been issued a registry identification card pursuant to the
 13  9 new Code chapter. A qualified patient may designate one or
 13 10 more primary caregivers. A primary caregiver is defined as a
 13 11 resident of this state, at least 18 years old, who has been
 13 12 designated by the patient's practitioner or a person having
 13 13 legal custody of the qualified patient as being necessary to
 13 14 take responsibility for managing the well=being of a qualified
 13 15 patient with respect to the medical use of cannabis pursuant
 13 16 to the provisions of the bill.  "Licensed producer" is defined
 13 17 as any qualified patient, primary caregiver, or nonprofit
 13 18 private entity within this state that the department of public
 13 19 health determines to be qualified to process, produce, possess,
 13 20 manufacture, distribute, dispense, deliver, and transport
 13 21 cannabis in this state under the bill.  A qualified patient or
 13 22 primary caregiver licensed as a producer shall produce no more
 13 23 than an adequate supply of cannabis for the patient's personal
 13 24 use only. "Practitioner" is defined as a person licensed in
 13 25 this state to prescribe and administer a controlled substance
 13 26 regulated under Code chapter 124.
 13 27    The bill provides that participation in the medical use of
 13 28 cannabis program by a qualified patient or primary caregiver
 13 29 does not relieve the qualified patient or primary caregiver
 13 30 from prosecution or civil penalties for activities not
 13 31 authorized under the bill, liability for damages or criminal
 13 32 prosecution arising out of the operation of a vehicle while
 13 33 under the influence of cannabis, or other criminal prosecution
 13 34 or civil penalties for possession or use of cannabis in certain
 13 35 situations.  A qualified patient or primary caregiver who
 14  1 makes a fraudulent representation to a law enforcement officer
 14  2 about the person's medical use of cannabis to avoid arrest
 14  3 or prosecution for a cannabis=related offense is guilty of a
 14  4 simple misdemeanor.
 14  5    The bill directs the department of public health to
 14  6 establish a medical cannabis advisory board no later
 14  7 than August 15, 2016, consisting of eight practitioners
 14  8 representing the fields of neurology, pain management, medical
 14  9 oncology, psychiatry, infectious disease, family medicine,
 14 10 and gynecology.  The practitioners shall be nationally
 14 11 board=certified in their area of specialty and knowledgeable
 14 12 about the medical use of cannabis and appointed by the
 14 13 director of public health from a list proposed by the Iowa
 14 14 medical society.  The advisory board is required to review
 14 15 and recommend to the department for approval additional
 14 16 debilitating medical conditions for persons who would benefit
 14 17 from the medical use of cannabis, accept and review petitions
 14 18 to add medical conditions, medical treatments, or diseases
 14 19 to the list of debilitating medical conditions that qualify
 14 20 for the medical use of cannabis, meet at least twice per year
 14 21 to conduct public hearings and to evaluate petitions to add
 14 22 medical conditions, medical treatments, or diseases to the
 14 23 list of debilitating medical conditions that qualify for the
 14 24 medical use of cannabis, issue recommendations concerning rules
 14 25 to be adopted for the issuance of registry identification
 14 26 cards, recommend quantities of cannabis that are necessary
 14 27 to constitute an adequate supply for qualified patients and
 14 28 primary caregivers, and review actions of the department in
 14 29 approving or denying registry identification card applications.
 14 30    The department is required to adopt rules pursuant to
 14 31 Code chapter 17A to establish and implement a medical use of
 14 32 cannabis program consistent with the purpose of the bill no
 14 33 later than October 1, 2016. The department is authorized to
 14 34 adopt emergency rules pursuant to Code chapter 17A.  The rules
 14 35 shall relate to applications for new and renewal registry
 15  1 identification cards and for qualified patients and primary
 15  2 caregivers, the amount of cannabis that constitutes an adequate
 15  3 supply for purposes of the bill, including amounts for topical
 15  4 treatments, criteria and procedures for including additional
 15  5 medical conditions, medical treatments, or diseases as
 15  6 debilitating medical conditions that qualify for the medical
 15  7 use of cannabis, requirements for the licensure of producers,
 15  8 the development of a distribution system for medical cannabis
 15  9 within this state, the establishment of application and renewal
 15 10 fees that generate revenues sufficient to offset all expenses
 15 11 of implementing and administering the new Code chapter, and
 15 12 specify and implement procedures that address public safety
 15 13 including security procedures and product quality, safety,
 15 14 and labeling. The department is to maintain confidential
 15 15 information collected pursuant to the bill and provide for the
 15 16 release of certain information to certain persons under certain
 15 17 confidentiality guidelines and to submit an annual report to
 15 18 the general assembly by January 15 of each year.
 15 19    The department is also required to issue a registry
 15 20 identification card to a qualified patient and any primary
 15 21 caregiver named in the qualified patient's application, if the
 15 22 qualified patient and each primary caregiver submit certain
 15 23 information in an application to the department.  The bill
 15 24 provides that possession of or application for a registry
 15 25 identification card shall not constitute probable cause or
 15 26 give rise to reasonable suspicion for a governmental agency
 15 27 to search the person or property of the person possessing or
 15 28 applying for the card.
 15 29    The bill provides that the department may adopt emergency
 15 30 rules and the rules shall be effective immediately upon filing
 15 31 unless a later date is specified in the rules.
 15 32    The bill provides that a medical cannabis registration card
 15 33 issued under Code chapter 124D (medical cannabidiol Act) prior
 15 34 to July 1, 2015, shall remain effective and continues in effect
 15 35 as issued for the 12=month period following its issuance.

 11 35 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
 12  1 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
 12  2    This bill creates the medical cannabis Act and provides for
 12  3 criminal penalties and fees.
 12  4    The bill amends Code section 124.401, relating to prohibited
 12  5 acts involving controlled substances, to provide that it is
 12  6 lawful for a person to knowingly or intentionally recommend,
 12  7 possess, use, dispense, deliver, transport, or administer
 12  8 medical cannabis if the recommendation, possession, use,
 12  9 dispensing, delivery, transporting, or administering is in
 12 10 accordance with the provisions of the bill.
 12 11    The bill establishes new Code chapter 124E, the medical
 12 12 cannabis Act, to allow for the medical use of cannabis for
 12 13 alleviating symptoms caused by debilitating medical conditions
 12 14 and their medical treatments.  The bill defines "medical use
 12 15 of cannabis" to mean the acquisition, possession, cultivation,
 12 16 manufacture, use, delivery, transfer, or transportation of
 12 17 cannabis or related paraphernalia to treat or alleviate a
 12 18 registered qualified patient's debilitating medical condition
 12 19 as defined in the bill. The bill defines "cannabis" to mean
 12 20 all parts of the plants of the genus cannabis, whether growing
 12 21 or not; the seeds thereof; the resin extracted from any part of
 12 22 the plant; and every compound, manufacture, salt, derivative,
 12 23 mixture, or preparation of the plant, its seeds, or resin,
 12 24 including tetrahydrocannabinols.  It does not include the
 12 25 mature stalks of the plant; fiber produced from the stalks; oil
 12 26 or cake made from the seeds of the plant; any other compound,
 12 27 manufacture, salt, derivative, mixture, or preparation of the
 12 28 mature stalks, except the resin extracted therefrom; fiber;
 12 29 or oil or cake or the sterilized seed of the plant which is
 12 30 incapable of germination (see also Code section 124.101(19)).
 12 31    The bill provides that a qualified patient who has been
 12 32 issued and who possesses a registry identification card issued
 12 33 by the Iowa department of public health shall not be subject to
 12 34 arrest or prosecution, civil or criminal penalty, or the denial
 12 35 of any right or privilege for the medical use of cannabis if
 13  1 the quantity of cannabis does not exceed an adequate supply.
 13  2 The bill also provides the same immunity for a qualified
 13  3 patient's primary caregiver and for a licensed producer.
 13  4    The bill defines a qualified patient as a resident of this
 13  5 state who has been diagnosed by a practitioner as having a
 13  6 debilitating medical condition as specified in the bill and
 13  7 who has received written certification by a practitioner and
 13  8 has been issued a registry identification card pursuant to the
 13  9 new Code chapter. A qualified patient may designate one or
 13 10 more primary caregivers. A primary caregiver is defined as a
 13 11 resident of this state, at least 18 years old, who has been
 13 12 designated by the patient's practitioner or a person having
 13 13 legal custody of the qualified patient as being necessary to
 13 14 take responsibility for managing the well=being of a qualified
 13 15 patient with respect to the medical use of cannabis pursuant
 13 16 to the provisions of the bill.  "Licensed producer" is defined
 13 17 as any qualified patient, primary caregiver, or nonprofit
 13 18 private entity within this state that the department of public
 13 19 health determines to be qualified to process, produce, possess,
 13 20 manufacture, distribute, dispense, deliver, and transport
 13 21 cannabis in this state under the bill.  A qualified patient or
 13 22 primary caregiver licensed as a producer shall produce no more
 13 23 than an adequate supply of cannabis for the patient's personal
 13 24 use only. "Practitioner" is defined as a person licensed in
 13 25 this state to prescribe and administer a controlled substance
 13 26 regulated under Code chapter 124.
 13 27    The bill provides that participation in the medical use of
 13 28 cannabis program by a qualified patient or primary caregiver
 13 29 does not relieve the qualified patient or primary caregiver
 13 30 from prosecution or civil penalties for activities not
 13 31 authorized under the bill, liability for damages or criminal
 13 32 prosecution arising out of the operation of a vehicle while
 13 33 under the influence of cannabis, or other criminal prosecution
 13 34 or civil penalties for possession or use of cannabis in certain
 13 35 situations.  A qualified patient or primary caregiver who
 14  1 makes a fraudulent representation to a law enforcement officer
 14  2 about the person's medical use of cannabis to avoid arrest
 14  3 or prosecution for a cannabis=related offense is guilty of a
 14  4 simple misdemeanor.
 14  5    The bill directs the department of public health to
 14  6 establish a medical cannabis advisory board no later
 14  7 than August 15, 2016, consisting of eight practitioners
 14  8 representing the fields of neurology, pain management, medical
 14  9 oncology, psychiatry, infectious disease, family medicine,
 14 10 and gynecology.  The practitioners shall be nationally
 14 11 board=certified in their area of specialty and knowledgeable
 14 12 about the medical use of cannabis and appointed by the
 14 13 director of public health from a list proposed by the Iowa
 14 14 medical society.  The advisory board is required to review
 14 15 and recommend to the department for approval additional
 14 16 debilitating medical conditions for persons who would benefit
 14 17 from the medical use of cannabis, accept and review petitions
 14 18 to add medical conditions, medical treatments, or diseases
 14 19 to the list of debilitating medical conditions that qualify
 14 20 for the medical use of cannabis, meet at least twice per year
 14 21 to conduct public hearings and to evaluate petitions to add
 14 22 medical conditions, medical treatments, or diseases to the
 14 23 list of debilitating medical conditions that qualify for the
 14 24 medical use of cannabis, issue recommendations concerning rules
 14 25 to be adopted for the issuance of registry identification
 14 26 cards, recommend quantities of cannabis that are necessary
 14 27 to constitute an adequate supply for qualified patients and
 14 28 primary caregivers, and review actions of the department in
 14 29 approving or denying registry identification card applications.
 14 30    The department is required to adopt rules pursuant to
 14 31 Code chapter 17A to establish and implement a medical use of
 14 32 cannabis program consistent with the purpose of the bill no
 14 33 later than October 1, 2016. The department is authorized to
 14 34 adopt emergency rules pursuant to Code chapter 17A.  The rules
 14 35 shall relate to applications for new and renewal registry
 15  1 identification cards and for qualified patients and primary
 15  2 caregivers, the amount of cannabis that constitutes an adequate
 15  3 supply for purposes of the bill, including amounts for topical
 15  4 treatments, criteria and procedures for including additional
 15  5 medical conditions, medical treatments, or diseases as
 15  6 debilitating medical conditions that qualify for the medical
 15  7 use of cannabis, requirements for the licensure of producers,
 15  8 the development of a distribution system for medical cannabis
 15  9 within this state, the establishment of application and renewal
 15 10 fees that generate revenues sufficient to offset all expenses
 15 11 of implementing and administering the new Code chapter, and
 15 12 specify and implement procedures that address public safety
 15 13 including security procedures and product quality, safety,
 15 14 and labeling. The department is to maintain confidential
 15 15 information collected pursuant to the bill and provide for the
 15 16 release of certain information to certain persons under certain
 15 17 confidentiality guidelines and to submit an annual report to
 15 18 the general assembly by January 15 of each year.
 15 19    The department is also required to issue a registry
 15 20 identification card to a qualified patient and any primary
 15 21 caregiver named in the qualified patient's application, if the
 15 22 qualified patient and each primary caregiver submit certain
 15 23 information in an application to the department.  The bill
 15 24 provides that possession of or application for a registry
 15 25 identification card shall not constitute probable cause or
 15 26 give rise to reasonable suspicion for a governmental agency
 15 27 to search the person or property of the person possessing or
 15 28 applying for the card.
 15 29    The bill provides that the department may adopt emergency
 15 30 rules and the rules shall be effective immediately upon filing
 15 31 unless a later date is specified in the rules.
 15 32    The bill provides that a medical cannabis registration card
 15 33 issued under Code chapter 124D (medical cannabidiol Act) prior

 12 29 or oil or cake or the sterilized seed of the plant which is
 12 30 incapable of germination (see also Code section 124.101(19)).
 12 31    The bill provides that a qualified patient who has been
 12 32 issued and who possesses a registry identification card issued

 13 32 prosecution arising out of the operation of a vehicle while
 13 33 under the influence of cannabis, or other criminal prosecution

 11 35 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
 12  1 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
 12  2    This bill creates the medical cannabis Act and provides for
 12  3 criminal penalties and fees.
 12  4    The bill amends Code section 124.401, relating to prohibited
 12  5 acts involving controlled substances, to provide that it is
 12  6 lawful for a person to knowingly or intentionally recommend,
 12  7 possess, use, dispense, deliver, transport, or administer
 12  8 medical cannabis if the recommendation, possession, use,
 12  9 dispensing, delivery, transporting, or administering is in
 12 10 accordance with the provisions of the bill.
 12 11    The bill establishes new Code chapter 124E, the medical
 12 12 cannabis Act, to allow for the medical use of cannabis for
 12 13 alleviating symptoms caused by debilitating medical conditions
 12 14 and their medical treatments.  The bill defines "medical use
 12 15 of cannabis" to mean the acquisition, possession, cultivation,
 12 16 manufacture, use, delivery, transfer, or transportation of
 12 17 cannabis or related paraphernalia to treat or alleviate a
 12 18 registered qualified patient's debilitating medical condition
 12 19 as defined in the bill. The bill defines "cannabis" to mean
 12 20 all parts of the plants of the genus cannabis, whether growing
 12 21 or not; the seeds thereof; the resin extracted from any part of
 12 22 the plant; and every compound, manufacture, salt, derivative,
 12 23 mixture, or preparation of the plant, its seeds, or resin,
 12 24 including tetrahydrocannabinols.  It does not include the
 12 25 mature stalks of the plant; fiber produced from the stalks; oil
 12 26 or cake made from the seeds of the plant; any other compound,
 12 27 manufacture, salt, derivative, mixture, or preparation of the
 12 28 mature stalks, except the resin extracted therefrom; fiber;
 12 29 or oil or cake or the sterilized seed of the plant which is
 12 30 incapable of germination (see also Code section 124.101(19)).
 12 31    The bill provides that a qualified patient who has been
 12 32 issued and who possesses a registry identification card issued
 12 33 by the Iowa department of public health shall not be subject to
 12 34 arrest or prosecution, civil or criminal penalty, or the denial
 12 35 of any right or privilege for the medical use of cannabis if
 13  1 the quantity of cannabis does not exceed an adequate supply.
 13  2 The bill also provides the same immunity for a qualified
 13  3 patient's primary caregiver and for a licensed producer.
 13  4    The bill defines a qualified patient as a resident of this
 13  5 state who has been diagnosed by a practitioner as having a
 13  6 debilitating medical condition as specified in the bill and
 13  7 who has received written certification by a practitioner and
 13  8 has been issued a registry identification card pursuant to the
 13  9 new Code chapter. A qualified patient may designate one or
 13 10 more primary caregivers. A primary caregiver is defined as a
 13 11 resident of this state, at least 18 years old, who has been
 13 12 designated by the patient's practitioner or a person having
 13 13 legal custody of the qualified patient as being necessary to
 13 14 take responsibility for managing the well=being of a qualified
 13 15 patient with respect to the medical use of cannabis pursuant
 13 16 to the provisions of the bill.  "Licensed producer" is defined
 13 17 as any qualified patient, primary caregiver, or nonprofit
 13 18 private entity within this state that the department of public
 13 19 health determines to be qualified to process, produce, possess,
 13 20 manufacture, distribute, dispense, deliver, and transport
 13 21 cannabis in this state under the bill.  A qualified patient or
 13 22 primary caregiver licensed as a producer shall produce no more
 13 23 than an adequate supply of cannabis for the patient's personal
 13 24 use only. "Practitioner" is defined as a person licensed in
 13 25 this state to prescribe and administer a controlled substance
 13 26 regulated under Code chapter 124.
 13 27    The bill provides that participation in the medical use of
 13 28 cannabis program by a qualified patient or primary caregiver
 13 29 does not relieve the qualified patient or primary caregiver
 13 30 from prosecution or civil penalties for activities not
 13 31 authorized under the bill, liability for damages or criminal
 13 32 prosecution arising out of the operation of a vehicle while
 13 33 under the influence of cannabis, or other criminal prosecution
 13 34 or civil penalties for possession or use of cannabis in certain
 13 35 situations.  A qualified patient or primary caregiver who
 14  1 makes a fraudulent representation to a law enforcement officer
 14  2 about the person's medical use of cannabis to avoid arrest
 14  3 or prosecution for a cannabis=related offense is guilty of a
 14  4 simple misdemeanor.
 14  5    The bill directs the department of public health to
 14  6 establish a medical cannabis advisory board no later
 14  7 than August 15, 2016, consisting of eight practitioners
 14  8 representing the fields of neurology, pain management, medical
 14  9 oncology, psychiatry, infectious disease, family medicine,
 14 10 and gynecology.  The practitioners shall be nationally
 14 11 board=certified in their area of specialty and knowledgeable
 14 12 about the medical use of cannabis and appointed by the
 14 13 director of public health from a list proposed by the Iowa
 14 14 medical society.  The advisory board is required to review
 14 15 and recommend to the department for approval additional
 14 16 debilitating medical conditions for persons who would benefit
 14 17 from the medical use of cannabis, accept and review petitions
 14 18 to add medical conditions, medical treatments, or diseases
 14 19 to the list of debilitating medical conditions that qualify
 14 20 for the medical use of cannabis, meet at least twice per year
 14 21 to conduct public hearings and to evaluate petitions to add
 14 22 medical conditions, medical treatments, or diseases to the
 14 23 list of debilitating medical conditions that qualify for the
 14 24 medical use of cannabis, issue recommendations concerning rules
 14 25 to be adopted for the issuance of registry identification
 14 26 cards, recommend quantities of cannabis that are necessary
 14 27 to constitute an adequate supply for qualified patients and
 14 28 primary caregivers, and review actions of the department in
 14 29 approving or denying registry identification card applications.
 14 30    The department is required to adopt rules pursuant to
 14 31 Code chapter 17A to establish and implement a medical use of
 14 32 cannabis program consistent with the purpose of the bill no
 14 33 later than October 1, 2016. The department is authorized to
 14 34 adopt emergency rules pursuant to Code chapter 17A.  The rules
 14 35 shall relate to applications for new and renewal registry
 15  1 identification cards and for qualified patients and primary
 15  2 caregivers, the amount of cannabis that constitutes an adequate
 15  3 supply for purposes of the bill, including amounts for topical
 15  4 treatments, criteria and procedures for including additional

 15  7 use of cannabis, requirements for the licensure of producers,
 15  8 the development of a distribution system for medical cannabis
 15  9 within this state, the establishment of application and renewal
 15 10 fees that generate revenues sufficient to offset all expenses
 15 11 of implementing and administering the new Code chapter, and
 15 12 specify and implement procedures that address public safety
 15 13 including security procedures and product quality, safety,
 15 14 and labeling. The department is to maintain confidential
 15 15 information collected pursuant to the bill and provide for the
 15 16 release of certain information to certain persons under certain
 15 17 confidentiality guidelines and to submit an annual report to
 15 18 the general assembly by January 15 of each year.
 15 19    The department is also required to issue a registry
 15 20 identification card to a qualified patient and any primary
 15 21 caregiver named in the qualified patient's application, if the
 15 22 qualified patient and each primary caregiver submit certain
 15 23 information in an application to the department.  The bill
 15 24 provides that possession of or application for a registry
 15 25 identification card shall not constitute probable cause or
 15 26 give rise to reasonable suspicion for a governmental agency
 15 27 to search the person or property of the person possessing or
 15 28 applying for the card.
 15 29    The bill provides that the department may adopt emergency
 15 30 rules and the rules shall be effective immediately upon filing
 15 31 unless a later date is specified in the rules.
 15 32    The bill provides that a medical cannabis registration card
 15 33 issued under Code chapter 124D (medical cannabidiol Act) prior

 12 31    The bill provides that a qualified patient who has been
 12 32 issued and who possesses a registry identification card issued
 12 33 by the Iowa department of public health shall not be subject to
 12 34 arrest or prosecution, civil or criminal penalty, or the denial

 13 32 prosecution arising out of the operation of a vehicle while
 13 33 under the influence of cannabis, or other criminal prosecution

 14  1 makes a fraudulent representation to a law enforcement officer
 14  2 about the person's medical use of cannabis to avoid arrest
 14  3 or prosecution for a cannabis=related offense is guilty of a
 14  4 simple misdemeanor.
 14  5    The bill directs the department of public health to
 14  6 establish a medical cannabis advisory board no later

 15 15 information collected pursuant to the bill and provide for the
 15 16 release of certain information to certain persons under certain

 15 21 caregiver named in the qualified patient's application, if the
 15 22 qualified patient and each primary caregiver submit certain

 12  1 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
 12  2    This bill creates the medical cannabis Act and provides for
 12  3 criminal penalties and fees.
 12  4    The bill amends Code section 124.401, relating to prohibited
 12  5 acts involving controlled substances, to provide that it is
 12  6 lawful for a person to knowingly or intentionally recommend,
 12  7 possess, use, dispense, deliver, transport, or administer
 12  8 medical cannabis if the recommendation, possession, use,
 12  9 dispensing, delivery, transporting, or administering is in
 12 10 accordance with the provisions of the bill.
 12 11    The bill establishes new Code chapter 124E, the medical
 12 12 cannabis Act, to allow for the medical use of cannabis for
 12 13 alleviating symptoms caused by debilitating medical conditions
 12 14 and their medical treatments.  The bill defines "medical use
 12 15 of cannabis" to mean the acquisition, possession, cultivation,
 12 16 manufacture, use, delivery, transfer, or transportation of
 12 17 cannabis or related paraphernalia to treat or alleviate a
 12 18 registered qualified patient's debilitating medical condition
 12 19 as defined in the bill. The bill defines "cannabis" to mean
 12 20 all parts of the plants of the genus cannabis, whether growing
 12 21 or not; the seeds thereof; the resin extracted from any part of
 12 22 the plant; and every compound, manufacture, salt, derivative,
 12 23 mixture, or preparation of the plant, its seeds, or resin,
 12 24 including tetrahydrocannabinols.  It does not include the
 12 25 mature stalks of the plant; fiber produced from the stalks; oil
 12 26 or cake made from the seeds of the plant; any other compound,
 12 27 manufacture, salt, derivative, mixture, or preparation of the
 12 28 mature stalks, except the resin extracted therefrom; fiber;
 12 29 or oil or cake or the sterilized seed of the plant which is
 12 30 incapable of germination (see also Code section 124.101(19)).
 12 31    The bill provides that a qualified patient who has been
 12 32 issued and who possesses a registry identification card issued
 12 33 by the Iowa department of public health shall not be subject to
 12 34 arrest or prosecution, civil or criminal penalty, or the denial
 12 35 of any right or privilege for the medical use of cannabis if
 13  1 the quantity of cannabis does not exceed an adequate supply.
 13  2 The bill also provides the same immunity for a qualified
 13  3 patient's primary caregiver and for a licensed producer.
 13  4    The bill defines a qualified patient as a resident of this
 13  5 state who has been diagnosed by a practitioner as having a
 13  6 debilitating medical condition as specified in the bill and
 13  7 who has received written certification by a practitioner and
 13  8 has been issued a registry identification card pursuant to the
 13  9 new Code chapter. A qualified patient may designate one or
 13 10 more primary caregivers. A primary caregiver is defined as a
 13 11 resident of this state, at least 18 years old, who has been
 13 12 designated by the patient's practitioner or a person having
 13 13 legal custody of the qualified patient as being necessary to
 13 14 take responsibility for managing the well=being of a qualified
 13 15 patient with respect to the medical use of cannabis pursuant
 13 16 to the provisions of the bill.  "Licensed producer" is defined
 13 17 as any qualified patient, primary caregiver, or nonprofit
 13 18 private entity within this state that the department of public
 13 19 health determines to be qualified to process, produce, possess,
 13 20 manufacture, distribute, dispense, deliver, and transport
 13 21 cannabis in this state under the bill.  A qualified patient or
 13 22 primary caregiver licensed as a producer shall produce no more
 13 23 than an adequate supply of cannabis for the patient's personal
 13 24 use only. "Practitioner" is defined as a person licensed in
 13 25 this state to prescribe and administer a controlled substance
 13 26 regulated under Code chapter 124.
 13 27    The bill provides that participation in the medical use of

 13 29 does not relieve the qualified patient or primary caregiver
 13 30 from prosecution or civil penalties for activities not
 13 31 authorized under the bill, liability for damages or criminal
 13 32 prosecution arising out of the operation of a vehicle while
 13 33 under the influence of cannabis, or other criminal prosecution
 13 34 or civil penalties for possession or use of cannabis in certain
 13 35 situations.  A qualified patient or primary caregiver who
 14  1 makes a fraudulent representation to a law enforcement officer
 14  2 about the person's medical use of cannabis to avoid arrest
 14  3 or prosecution for a cannabis=related offense is guilty of a
 14  4 simple misdemeanor.
 14  5    The bill directs the department of public health to
 14  6 establish a medical cannabis advisory board no later
 14  7 than August 15, 2016, consisting of eight practitioners
 14  8 representing the fields of neurology, pain management, medical
 14  9 oncology, psychiatry, infectious disease, family medicine,

 14 11 board=certified in their area of specialty and knowledgeable
 14 12 about the medical use of cannabis and appointed by the
 14 13 director of public health from a list proposed by the Iowa
 14 14 medical society.  The advisory board is required to review
 14 15 and recommend to the department for approval additional
 14 16 debilitating medical conditions for persons who would benefit
 14 17 from the medical use of cannabis, accept and review petitions
 14 18 to add medical conditions, medical treatments, or diseases
 14 19 to the list of debilitating medical conditions that qualify
 14 20 for the medical use of cannabis, meet at least twice per year
 14 21 to conduct public hearings and to evaluate petitions to add
 14 22 medical conditions, medical treatments, or diseases to the
 14 23 list of debilitating medical conditions that qualify for the
 14 24 medical use of cannabis, issue recommendations concerning rules
 14 25 to be adopted for the issuance of registry identification
 14 26 cards, recommend quantities of cannabis that are necessary
 14 27 to constitute an adequate supply for qualified patients and
 14 28 primary caregivers, and review actions of the department in
 14 29 approving or denying registry identification card applications.
 14 30    The department is required to adopt rules pursuant to
 14 31 Code chapter 17A to establish and implement a medical use of
 14 32 cannabis program consistent with the purpose of the bill no
 14 33 later than October 1, 2016. The department is authorized to
 14 34 adopt emergency rules pursuant to Code chapter 17A.  The rules
 14 35 shall relate to applications for new and renewal registry
 15  1 identification cards and for qualified patients and primary
 15  2 caregivers, the amount of cannabis that constitutes an adequate
 15  3 supply for purposes of the bill, including amounts for topical

 15  7 use of cannabis, requirements for the licensure of producers,
 15  8 the development of a distribution system for medical cannabis
 15  9 within this state, the establishment of application and renewal
 15 10 fees that generate revenues sufficient to offset all expenses
 15 11 of implementing and administering the new Code chapter, and
 15 12 specify and implement procedures that address public safety
 15 13 including security procedures and product quality, safety,
 15 14 and labeling. The department is to maintain confidential
 15 15 information collected pursuant to the bill and provide for the
 15 16 release of certain information to certain persons under certain
 15 17 confidentiality guidelines and to submit an annual report to
 15 18 the general assembly by January 15 of each year.
 15 19    The department is also required to issue a registry
 15 20 identification card to a qualified patient and any primary
 15 21 caregiver named in the qualified patient's application, if the
 15 22 qualified patient and each primary caregiver submit certain
 15 23 information in an application to the department.  The bill
 15 24 provides that possession of or application for a registry
 15 25 identification card shall not constitute probable cause or
 15 26 give rise to reasonable suspicion for a governmental agency
 15 27 to search the person or property of the person possessing or
 15 28 applying for the card.
 15 29    The bill provides that the department may adopt emergency
 15 30 rules and the rules shall be effective immediately upon filing

 15 32    The bill provides that a medical cannabis registration card
 15 33 issued under Code chapter 124D (medical cannabidiol Act) prior

 12  4    The bill amends Code section 124.401, relating to prohibited
 12  5 acts involving controlled substances, to provide that it is
 12  6 lawful for a person to knowingly or intentionally recommend,
 12  7 possess, use, dispense, deliver, transport, or administer

 12 20 all parts of the plants of the genus cannabis, whether growing
 12 21 or not; the seeds thereof; the resin extracted from any part of
 12 22 the plant; and every compound, manufacture, salt, derivative,
 12 23 mixture, or preparation of the plant, its seeds, or resin,
 12 24 including tetrahydrocannabinols.  It does not include the
 12 25 mature stalks of the plant; fiber produced from the stalks; oil
 12 26 or cake made from the seeds of the plant; any other compound,
 12 27 manufacture, salt, derivative, mixture, or preparation of the

 12 29 or oil or cake or the sterilized seed of the plant which is
 12 30 incapable of germination (see also Code section 124.101(19)).
 12 31    The bill provides that a qualified patient who has been
 12 32 issued and who possesses a registry identification card issued
 12 33 by the Iowa department of public health shall not be subject to
 12 34 arrest or prosecution, civil or criminal penalty, or the denial
 12 35 of any right or privilege for the medical use of cannabis if

 13 11 resident of this state, at least 18 years old, who has been
 13 12 designated by the patient's practitioner or a person having
 13 13 legal custody of the qualified patient as being necessary to

 13 27    The bill provides that participation in the medical use of

 13 32 prosecution arising out of the operation of a vehicle while
 13 33 under the influence of cannabis, or other criminal prosecution

 14  1 makes a fraudulent representation to a law enforcement officer
 14  2 about the person's medical use of cannabis to avoid arrest
 14  3 or prosecution for a cannabis=related offense is guilty of a

 14 24 medical use of cannabis, issue recommendations concerning rules
 14 25 to be adopted for the issuance of registry identification
 14 26 cards, recommend quantities of cannabis that are necessary
 14 27 to constitute an adequate supply for qualified patients and
 14 28 primary caregivers, and review actions of the department in

 15 14 and labeling. The department is to maintain confidential
 15 15 information collected pursuant to the bill and provide for the
 15 16 release of certain information to certain persons under certain

 15 20 identification card to a qualified patient and any primary
 15 21 caregiver named in the qualified patient's application, if the
 15 22 qualified patient and each primary caregiver submit certain
 15 23 information in an application to the department.  The bill
 15 24 provides that possession of or application for a registry
 15 25 identification card shall not constitute probable cause or
 15 26 give rise to reasonable suspicion for a governmental agency
 15 27 to search the person or property of the person possessing or
 15 28 applying for the card.
 15 29    The bill provides that the department may adopt emergency
 15 30 rules and the rules shall be effective immediately upon filing

 11 34                           EXPLANATION
 11 35 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
 12  1 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
 12  2    This bill creates the medical cannabis Act and provides for
 12  3 criminal penalties and fees.
 12  4    The bill amends Code section 124.401, relating to prohibited
 12  5 acts involving controlled substances, to provide that it is
 12  6 lawful for a person to knowingly or intentionally recommend,
 12  7 possess, use, dispense, deliver, transport, or administer
 12  8 medical cannabis if the recommendation, possession, use,
 12  9 dispensing, delivery, transporting, or administering is in
 12 10 accordance with the provisions of the bill.
 12 11    The bill establishes new Code chapter 124E, the medical
 12 12 cannabis Act, to allow for the medical use of cannabis for
 12 13 alleviating symptoms caused by debilitating medical conditions
 12 14 and their medical treatments.  The bill defines "medical use
 12 15 of cannabis" to mean the acquisition, possession, cultivation,
 12 16 manufacture, use, delivery, transfer, or transportation of
 12 17 cannabis or related paraphernalia to treat or alleviate a
 12 18 registered qualified patient's debilitating medical condition
 12 19 as defined in the bill. The bill defines "cannabis" to mean
 12 20 all parts of the plants of the genus cannabis, whether growing
 12 21 or not; the seeds thereof; the resin extracted from any part of
 12 22 the plant; and every compound, manufacture, salt, derivative,
 12 23 mixture, or preparation of the plant, its seeds, or resin,
 12 24 including tetrahydrocannabinols.  It does not include the
 12 25 mature stalks of the plant; fiber produced from the stalks; oil
 12 26 or cake made from the seeds of the plant; any other compound,
 12 27 manufacture, salt, derivative, mixture, or preparation of the
 12 28 mature stalks, except the resin extracted therefrom; fiber;
 12 29 or oil or cake or the sterilized seed of the plant which is
 12 30 incapable of germination (see also Code section 124.101(19)).
 12 31    The bill provides that a qualified patient who has been
 12 32 issued and who possesses a registry identification card issued
 12 33 by the Iowa department of public health shall not be subject to
 12 34 arrest or prosecution, civil or criminal penalty, or the denial
 12 35 of any right or privilege for the medical use of cannabis if
 13  1 the quantity of cannabis does not exceed an adequate supply.
 13  2 The bill also provides the same immunity for a qualified
 13  3 patient's primary caregiver and for a licensed producer.
 13  4    The bill defines a qualified patient as a resident of this
 13  5 state who has been diagnosed by a practitioner as having a
 13  6 debilitating medical condition as specified in the bill and
 13  7 who has received written certification by a practitioner and
 13  8 has been issued a registry identification card pursuant to the
 13  9 new Code chapter. A qualified patient may designate one or
 13 10 more primary caregivers. A primary caregiver is defined as a
 13 11 resident of this state, at least 18 years old, who has been
 13 12 designated by the patient's practitioner or a person having
 13 13 legal custody of the qualified patient as being necessary to

 13 17 as any qualified patient, primary caregiver, or nonprofit
 13 18 private entity within this state that the department of public

 13 21 cannabis in this state under the bill.  A qualified patient or
 13 22 primary caregiver licensed as a producer shall produce no more
 13 23 than an adequate supply of cannabis for the patient's personal
 13 24 use only. "Practitioner" is defined as a person licensed in
 13 25 this state to prescribe and administer a controlled substance
 13 26 regulated under Code chapter 124.
 13 27    The bill provides that participation in the medical use of

 13 29 does not relieve the qualified patient or primary caregiver
 13 30 from prosecution or civil penalties for activities not
 13 31 authorized under the bill, liability for damages or criminal
 13 32 prosecution arising out of the operation of a vehicle while
 13 33 under the influence of cannabis, or other criminal prosecution
 13 34 or civil penalties for possession or use of cannabis in certain
 13 35 situations.  A qualified patient or primary caregiver who
 14  1 makes a fraudulent representation to a law enforcement officer
 14  2 about the person's medical use of cannabis to avoid arrest
 14  3 or prosecution for a cannabis=related offense is guilty of a
 14  4 simple misdemeanor.
 14  5    The bill directs the department of public health to
 14  6 establish a medical cannabis advisory board no later

 14 14 medical society.  The advisory board is required to review
 14 15 and recommend to the department for approval additional
 14 16 debilitating medical conditions for persons who would benefit
 14 17 from the medical use of cannabis, accept and review petitions
 14 18 to add medical conditions, medical treatments, or diseases
 14 19 to the list of debilitating medical conditions that qualify
 14 20 for the medical use of cannabis, meet at least twice per year
 14 21 to conduct public hearings and to evaluate petitions to add
 14 22 medical conditions, medical treatments, or diseases to the
 14 23 list of debilitating medical conditions that qualify for the
 14 24 medical use of cannabis, issue recommendations concerning rules
 14 25 to be adopted for the issuance of registry identification
 14 26 cards, recommend quantities of cannabis that are necessary
 14 27 to constitute an adequate supply for qualified patients and
 14 28 primary caregivers, and review actions of the department in
 14 29 approving or denying registry identification card applications.
 14 30    The department is required to adopt rules pursuant to
 14 31 Code chapter 17A to establish and implement a medical use of
 14 32 cannabis program consistent with the purpose of the bill no

 12  1 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
 12  2    This bill creates the medical cannabis Act and provides for
 12  3 criminal penalties and fees.
 12  4    The bill amends Code section 124.401, relating to prohibited
 12  5 acts involving controlled substances, to provide that it is
 12  6 lawful for a person to knowingly or intentionally recommend,
 12  7 possess, use, dispense, deliver, transport, or administer
 12  8 medical cannabis if the recommendation, possession, use,
 12  9 dispensing, delivery, transporting, or administering is in
 12 10 accordance with the provisions of the bill.
 12 11    The bill establishes new Code chapter 124E, the medical
 12 12 cannabis Act, to allow for the medical use of cannabis for
 12 13 alleviating symptoms caused by debilitating medical conditions
 12 14 and their medical treatments.  The bill defines "medical use
 12 15 of cannabis" to mean the acquisition, possession, cultivation,
 12 16 manufacture, use, delivery, transfer, or transportation of
 12 17 cannabis or related paraphernalia to treat or alleviate a
 12 18 registered qualified patient's debilitating medical condition
 12 19 as defined in the bill. The bill defines "cannabis" to mean
 12 20 all parts of the plants of the genus cannabis, whether growing
 12 21 or not; the seeds thereof; the resin extracted from any part of
 12 22 the plant; and every compound, manufacture, salt, derivative,
 12 23 mixture, or preparation of the plant, its seeds, or resin,
 12 24 including tetrahydrocannabinols.  It does not include the
 12 25 mature stalks of the plant; fiber produced from the stalks; oil
 12 26 or cake made from the seeds of the plant; any other compound,
 12 27 manufacture, salt, derivative, mixture, or preparation of the
 12 28 mature stalks, except the resin extracted therefrom; fiber;
 12 29 or oil or cake or the sterilized seed of the plant which is
 12 30 incapable of germination (see also Code section 124.101(19)).
 12 31    The bill provides that a qualified patient who has been
 12 32 issued and who possesses a registry identification card issued
 12 33 by the Iowa department of public health shall not be subject to
 12 34 arrest or prosecution, civil or criminal penalty, or the denial
 12 35 of any right or privilege for the medical use of cannabis if
 13  1 the quantity of cannabis does not exceed an adequate supply.
 13  2 The bill also provides the same immunity for a qualified
 13  3 patient's primary caregiver and for a licensed producer.
 13  4    The bill defines a qualified patient as a resident of this
 13  5 state who has been diagnosed by a practitioner as having a
 13  6 debilitating medical condition as specified in the bill and
 13  7 who has received written certification by a practitioner and
 13  8 has been issued a registry identification card pursuant to the
 13  9 new Code chapter. A qualified patient may designate one or
 13 10 more primary caregivers. A primary caregiver is defined as a
 13 11 resident of this state, at least 18 years old, who has been
 13 12 designated by the patient's practitioner or a person having
 13 13 legal custody of the qualified patient as being necessary to
 13 14 take responsibility for managing the well=being of a qualified
 13 15 patient with respect to the medical use of cannabis pursuant
 13 16 to the provisions of the bill.  "Licensed producer" is defined
 13 17 as any qualified patient, primary caregiver, or nonprofit
 13 18 private entity within this state that the department of public
 13 19 health determines to be qualified to process, produce, possess,

 13 21 cannabis in this state under the bill.  A qualified patient or
 13 22 primary caregiver licensed as a producer shall produce no more
 13 23 than an adequate supply of cannabis for the patient's personal
 13 24 use only. "Practitioner" is defined as a person licensed in
 13 25 this state to prescribe and administer a controlled substance
 13 26 regulated under Code chapter 124.
 13 27    The bill provides that participation in the medical use of

 13 29 does not relieve the qualified patient or primary caregiver
 13 30 from prosecution or civil penalties for activities not
 13 31 authorized under the bill, liability for damages or criminal
 13 32 prosecution arising out of the operation of a vehicle while
 13 33 under the influence of cannabis, or other criminal prosecution
 13 34 or civil penalties for possession or use of cannabis in certain
 13 35 situations.  A qualified patient or primary caregiver who
 14  1 makes a fraudulent representation to a law enforcement officer
 14  2 about the person's medical use of cannabis to avoid arrest
 14  3 or prosecution for a cannabis=related offense is guilty of a
 14  4 simple misdemeanor.

 14 30    The department is required to adopt rules pursuant to
 14 31 Code chapter 17A to establish and implement a medical use of

 13 12 designated by the patient's practitioner or a person having
 13 13 legal custody of the qualified patient as being necessary to
 13 14 take responsibility for managing the well=being of a qualified
 13 15 patient with respect to the medical use of cannabis pursuant
 13 16 to the provisions of the bill.  "Licensed producer" is defined
 13 17 as any qualified patient, primary caregiver, or nonprofit
 13 18 private entity within this state that the department of public
 13 19 health determines to be qualified to process, produce, possess,
 13 20 manufacture, distribute, dispense, deliver, and transport
 13 21 cannabis in this state under the bill.  A qualified patient or

 13 32 prosecution arising out of the operation of a vehicle while
 13 33 under the influence of cannabis, or other criminal prosecution
 13 34 or civil penalties for possession or use of cannabis in certain
 13 35 situations.  A qualified patient or primary caregiver who
 14  1 makes a fraudulent representation to a law enforcement officer
 14  2 about the person's medical use of cannabis to avoid arrest
 14  3 or prosecution for a cannabis=related offense is guilty of a
 14  4 simple misdemeanor.
 14  5    The bill directs the department of public health to
 14  6 establish a medical cannabis advisory board no later
 14  7 than August 15, 2016, consisting of eight practitioners
 14  8 representing the fields of neurology, pain management, medical
 14  9 oncology, psychiatry, infectious disease, family medicine,

 14 11 board=certified in their area of specialty and knowledgeable
 14 12 about the medical use of cannabis and appointed by the
 14 13 director of public health from a list proposed by the Iowa
 14 14 medical society.  The advisory board is required to review
 14 15 and recommend to the department for approval additional
 14 16 debilitating medical conditions for persons who would benefit
 14 17 from the medical use of cannabis, accept and review petitions
 14 18 to add medical conditions, medical treatments, or diseases
 14 19 to the list of debilitating medical conditions that qualify
 14 20 for the medical use of cannabis, meet at least twice per year
 14 21 to conduct public hearings and to evaluate petitions to add
 14 22 medical conditions, medical treatments, or diseases to the
 14 23 list of debilitating medical conditions that qualify for the
 14 24 medical use of cannabis, issue recommendations concerning rules
 14 25 to be adopted for the issuance of registry identification
 14 26 cards, recommend quantities of cannabis that are necessary
 14 27 to constitute an adequate supply for qualified patients and
 14 28 primary caregivers, and review actions of the department in
 14 29 approving or denying registry identification card applications.
 14 30    The department is required to adopt rules pursuant to
 14 31 Code chapter 17A to establish and implement a medical use of
 14 32 cannabis program consistent with the purpose of the bill no
 14 33 later than October 1, 2016. The department is authorized to
 14 34 adopt emergency rules pursuant to Code chapter 17A.  The rules

 15  1 identification cards and for qualified patients and primary
 15  2 caregivers, the amount of cannabis that constitutes an adequate
 15  3 supply for purposes of the bill, including amounts for topical
 15  4 treatments, criteria and procedures for including additional
 15  5 medical conditions, medical treatments, or diseases as
 15  6 debilitating medical conditions that qualify for the medical
 15  7 use of cannabis, requirements for the licensure of producers,
 15  8 the development of a distribution system for medical cannabis
 15  9 within this state, the establishment of application and renewal
 15 10 fees that generate revenues sufficient to offset all expenses
 15 11 of implementing and administering the new Code chapter, and
 15 12 specify and implement procedures that address public safety
 15 13 including security procedures and product quality, safety,
 15 14 and labeling. The department is to maintain confidential
 15 15 information collected pursuant to the bill and provide for the
 15 16 release of certain information to certain persons under certain
 15 17 confidentiality guidelines and to submit an annual report to
 15 18 the general assembly by January 15 of each year.
 15 19    The department is also required to issue a registry
 15 20 identification card to a qualified patient and any primary
 15 21 caregiver named in the qualified patient's application, if the
 15 22 qualified patient and each primary caregiver submit certain

 15 24 provides that possession of or application for a registry
 15 25 identification card shall not constitute probable cause or
 15 26 give rise to reasonable suspicion for a governmental agency
 15 27 to search the person or property of the person possessing or
 15 28 applying for the card.
 15 29    The bill provides that the department may adopt emergency
 15 30 rules and the rules shall be effective immediately upon filing
 15 31 unless a later date is specified in the rules.
 15 32    The bill provides that a medical cannabis registration card

 12 22 the plant; and every compound, manufacture, salt, derivative,
 12 23 mixture, or preparation of the plant, its seeds, or resin,
 12 24 including tetrahydrocannabinols.  It does not include the
 12 25 mature stalks of the plant; fiber produced from the stalks; oil
 12 26 or cake made from the seeds of the plant; any other compound,
 12 27 manufacture, salt, derivative, mixture, or preparation of the

 12 31    The bill provides that a qualified patient who has been
 12 32 issued and who possesses a registry identification card issued
 12 33 by the Iowa department of public health shall not be subject to
 12 34 arrest or prosecution, civil or criminal penalty, or the denial
 12 35 of any right or privilege for the medical use of cannabis if
 13  1 the quantity of cannabis does not exceed an adequate supply.

 13  6 debilitating medical condition as specified in the bill and
 13  7 who has received written certification by a practitioner and
 13  8 has been issued a registry identification card pursuant to the
 13  9 new Code chapter. A qualified patient may designate one or
 13 10 more primary caregivers. A primary caregiver is defined as a
 13 11 resident of this state, at least 18 years old, who has been
 13 12 designated by the patient's practitioner or a person having
 13 13 legal custody of the qualified patient as being necessary to
