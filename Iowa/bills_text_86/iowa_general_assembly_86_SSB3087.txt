Concerning

maintain
a

of
scrutinized

16


that
the
fund
has
direct
or

shall
18


determine
this
list
by
March
1,
2017,
and
update
it
on
an
19


annual
basis.
The
bill
defines
“scrutinized
companies”
as
20


those
companies
engaging
in
refusals
to
deal,
terminating
21


business
activities,

32


If

the
