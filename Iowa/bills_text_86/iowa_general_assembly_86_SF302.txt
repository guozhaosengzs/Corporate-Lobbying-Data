  1  4 disability that affects their ability to learn, work,
  1  5 communicate, perform activities of daily living, and
  1  6 participate in everyday community life.  These disabilities
  1  7 are the result of genetics, environmental factors, injury, or
  1  8 illness; may occur at any point in life; may be mild, severe,
  1  9 or intermittent; and are often very costly for the individuals
  1 10 affected, their families, and government both in terms of
  1 11 quality of life and financial expenditures.
  1 12    b.  Most disabilities are due to conditions that can be
  1 13 prevented, can be minimized if recognized and treated early, or
  1 14 can be reduced through appropriate accommodation.
  1 15    c.  A need exists to optimize the use of cost=effective
  1 16 prevention of disability strategies in state policies and
  1 17 programs in order to reduce the cost of disabilities to Iowa's
  1 18 citizens and government.

  5  9 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  5 10 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  5 11    This bill relates to the prevention of disabilities policy
  5 12 council.
  5 13    In 1991, the general assembly established the prevention
  5 14 of disabilities council (council) in Code chapter 225B.  The
  5 15 council was created to establish a system to coordinate
  5 16 prevention of disability activities among state departments and
  5 17 to assist the governor and the general assembly in determining
  5 18 priorities and establishing policies for the prevention of
  5 19 disabilities.
  5 20    The bill amends provisions in Code chapter 225B relating
  5 21 to prevention activities of the council, council membership,
  5 22 duties, and coordination efforts with state agencies and
  5 23 disability groups, and related definitions.
  5 24    The bill defines prevention activities of the council to
  5 25 include policies, programs, and practices that prevent a
  5 26 disability or a condition that leads to a disability from
  5 27 occurring; that identify a disability or a condition that leads
  5 28 to a disability early on so that the intervention can eliminate
  5 29 the risk of a disability or minimize the disability's effect;
  5 30 or that reduce the effects of a disability on an individual's
  5 31 health and independence.  The bill amends the definition of
  5 32 a disability to be the same as the federal definition under
  5 33 the federal Americans with Disabilities Act (42 U.S.C. section
  5 34 12102).
  5 35    The bill provides that the council replaces the current
  6  1 Iowa developmental disabilities council, to be abolished by
  6  2 law July 1, 2015, in providing recommendations for individual
  6  3 appointments of voting members to the council and council
  6  4 membership is expanded to include ex officio representatives
  6  5 from the department on aging, and the departments of education,
  6  6 public health, and human services.
  6  7    The duties of the council are expanded to include reviewing
  6  8 the prevention of disabilities activities of public and
  6  9 private entities and providing recommendations to optimize
  6 10 the planning, implementation, and evaluation of prevention of
  6 11 disabilities efforts; promoting cooperative and complementary
  6 12 planning among the public, nonpublic, and volunteer sectors
  6 13 involved in prevention of disabilities activities; facilitating
  6 14 coordination of prevention of disabilities activities
  6 15 among state departments to develop an integrated system of
  6 16 care; providing support and technical assistance to public
  6 17 or nonpublic entities to identify, seek, implement, and
  6 18 evaluate state, federal, and private grants for prevention
  6 19 of disabilities activities; encouraging research into the
  6 20 causes and prevention of disabilities, including methods to
  6 21 evaluate the effectiveness of prevention efforts; and promoting
  6 22 professional and provider training in evidence=based prevention
  6 23 of disabilities measures and assure adequate dissemination of
  6 24 such to appropriate entities.
  6 25    The bill provides that the directors or deputy directors
  6 26 of the state department on aging, and the departments of
  6 27 education, human services, and public health shall meet at
  6 28 least annually with the council to provide updates to the
  6 29 council regarding the status of prevention of disabilities
  6 30 policies and receive new policy and program recommendations
  6 31 from the council regarding the prevention of disabilities.
  6 32 Chairpersons and staff of public and private state disability

  5 11    This bill relates to the prevention of disabilities policy
  5 12 council.
  5 13    In 1991, the general assembly established the prevention
  5 14 of disabilities council (council) in Code chapter 225B.  The
  5 15 council was created to establish a system to coordinate
  5 16 prevention of disability activities among state departments and
  5 17 to assist the governor and the general assembly in determining
  5 18 priorities and establishing policies for the prevention of
  5 19 disabilities.
  5 20    The bill amends provisions in Code chapter 225B relating
  5 21 to prevention activities of the council, council membership,
  5 22 duties, and coordination efforts with state agencies and
  5 23 disability groups, and related definitions.
  5 24    The bill defines prevention activities of the council to
  5 25 include policies, programs, and practices that prevent a
  5 26 disability or a condition that leads to a disability from
  5 27 occurring; that identify a disability or a condition that leads
  5 28 to a disability early on so that the intervention can eliminate
  5 29 the risk of a disability or minimize the disability's effect;
  5 30 or that reduce the effects of a disability on an individual's
  5 31 health and independence.  The bill amends the definition of
  5 32 a disability to be the same as the federal definition under
  5 33 the federal Americans with Disabilities Act (42 U.S.C. section
  5 34 12102).
  5 35    The bill provides that the council replaces the current
  6  1 Iowa developmental disabilities council, to be abolished by
  6  2 law July 1, 2015, in providing recommendations for individual
  6  3 appointments of voting members to the council and council
  6  4 membership is expanded to include ex officio representatives
  6  5 from the department on aging, and the departments of education,
  6  6 public health, and human services.
  6  7    The duties of the council are expanded to include reviewing
  6  8 the prevention of disabilities activities of public and
  6  9 private entities and providing recommendations to optimize
  6 10 the planning, implementation, and evaluation of prevention of
  6 11 disabilities efforts; promoting cooperative and complementary
  6 12 planning among the public, nonpublic, and volunteer sectors
  6 13 involved in prevention of disabilities activities; facilitating
  6 14 coordination of prevention of disabilities activities
  6 15 among state departments to develop an integrated system of
  6 16 care; providing support and technical assistance to public
  6 17 or nonpublic entities to identify, seek, implement, and

  6 19 of disabilities activities; encouraging research into the
  6 20 causes and prevention of disabilities, including methods to
  6 21 evaluate the effectiveness of prevention efforts; and promoting

  6 23 of disabilities measures and assure adequate dissemination of
