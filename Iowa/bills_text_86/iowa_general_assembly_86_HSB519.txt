BACKGROUND.
A
biofuel
is
a
substance
blended
with
motor
fuel
23


(gasoline
or
diesel
fuel)
and
includes
either
ethanol
(ethyl
24


alcohol)
or
biodiesel
(a
substance
derived
from
vegetable
25


oils
or
animal
fats)
meeting
state
standards
(Code
section
26


214A.2).
A
motor
fuel
blended
with
a
biofuel
is
referred
to
27


as
a
renewable
fuel.
The
amount
of
the
tax
credit
or
refund


28


is
claimed
by
a
taxpayer
on
a
tax
or
calendar
year
basis
after
29


multiplying
the
total
gallonage
of
a
qualifying
renewable
fuel
30


or
biofuel
times
a
designated
monetary
rate.
31


CURRENT
INCOME

The

by
a
retail

operating
a
retail
motor
fuel
33


site
and
the
amount
of
each
tax
credit
is
based
on
the
total
34


number
of
gallons
of
a
renewable
fuel
sold.

a
biodiesel
producer
who
manufactures
biodiesel
11


for
use
in
biodiesel
blended

The
amount
of
the
refund
12


equals
the
total
number
of
gallons
of
biodiesel
produced
during
13


each
calendar
year
quarter
multiplied
by
a
designated
rate
14


of
2
cents.
However,
a
producer
cannot
claim
the
refund
on
15


more
than
25

FUTURE

The

amends
Code
sections
creating
the
E-85
19


gasoline
promotion
tax
credit
and
the
E-15
plus
gasoline
20


promotion
tax
credit
by
repealing
references
to
another
tax
21


credit
referred
to
as
the
ethanol
promotion
tax
credit
claimed
22


by
a
retail
dealer
who
attains
a
certain
threshold
number
of
23


all
biofuels
sold
during
a
determination
period
and
which
is
24


based
on
the
number
of
gallons
of
pure
ethanol
sold
during
that
25


period.
The
amendments
become
effective
on
January
1,
2021,

which
is
the
date
that
the
