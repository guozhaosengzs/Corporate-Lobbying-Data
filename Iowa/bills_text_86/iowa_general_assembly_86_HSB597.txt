The

requires
the

The
bill
also
requires
the
court
to
consider
9


the
risk
assessment
in
determining
the
appropriate
conditions
10


for
release.
In
determining
whether
to
release
a
defendant,
11


the
court
shall
determine
whether
sufficient
conditions
for
12


release
are
available
that
are
designed
to
reduce
the
risk
to
13


another
individual,
detect
threatening
or
criminal
behavior,
14


and
increase
the
safety
of
individuals
and
the
general
public,
15


and
balance
those

assessment
situation
for
violating
a
no-contact
order
or
22


protective
order,
being
convicted
of
domestic
abuse
assault,
23


or
as
a
condition
of
release
for
a
bailable
defendant
if
the
24


defendant
is
a
risk
to
another
person.
The
bill
specifies
that
25


when
ordering
the
use
of
an
electronic

and
monitoring

system
the

shall
consider
the
safety
of
the
victim
and
27


other
legitimate
factors
that
may
impact
all
of
the
parties.
28


If
an
electronic

system
is
ordered,
29


the
court
is
required
to
order
the
defendant
to
pay
the
costs
30


associated
with
the
imposition
of
the
system.
If
the
defendant
31


fails
to
pay
the
fees
of
the
electronic
tracking
and
monitoring
32


system
in
a
timely
manner,
the

provides
that

impose
