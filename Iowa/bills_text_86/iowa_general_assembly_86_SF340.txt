  1  8 shall be prescribed by the department.
  1  9    2.  If a commercial establishment fails to furnish a written

  1 13    3.  Any waiver of a right by a consumer under this section
  1 14 is void.
  1 15    4.  The express warranty shall expire twenty=one days from

  1 24    (2)  An illness or disease does not include the presence of
  1 25 fleas or ticks.
  1 26    b.  A congenital or hereditary condition that adversely

  2 33 and land stewardship.   The bill provides that a commercial

  3  3 The bill provides that the express warranty applies regardless
  3  4 of whether the commercial establishment provides the consumer
  3  5 with a specific written form required to be promulgated by
  3  6 the department.  The bill provides that the express warranty
  3  7 cannot be waived by the consumer and that the warranty expires
  3  8 21 days from the date that the consumer takes possession of
  3  9 the dog or cat. The express warranty covers illness, disease,

  3 13 of veterinarian fees.  The commercial establishment must post a
  3 14 notice briefly explaining the express warranty in a conspicuous

  3 20 as part of the costs of the action.  In addition, the court
  3 21 may grant any equitable relief that the court determines is

  3 23    CIVIL PENALTY APPLICABLE.  A commercial establishment
  3 24 violating the bill's provisions is subject to a civil penalty
  3 25 of not more than $500 and each day of a violation constitutes a
  3 26 separate offense (Code section 162.12A).
  3 27    BACKGROUND.  Commercial establishments that are involved in
  3 28 these types of transactions include animal shelters and pounds
  3 29 which are required to obtain a certificate of registration;
  3 30 pet shops which are required to obtain a state license; and
  3 31 commercial breeders which are required to obtain a state
  3 32 license or a permit if licensed by the United States department
