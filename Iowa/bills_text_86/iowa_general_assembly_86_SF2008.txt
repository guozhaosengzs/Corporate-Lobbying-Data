  3 19 to an individual, so long as the first responder reasonably and
  3 20 in good faith believes that such individual is experiencing an
  3 21 opioid=related overdose.
  3 22    The bill provides immunity from legal liability to any first
  3 23 responder, emergency medical service program, law enforcement
  3 24 agency, fire department, and the person who prescribed the

  2 35 nursing, or a physician assistant licensed to practice under
  3  1 the supervision of a physician as authorized in Code chapters
  3  2 147 and 148C.  "Opioid antagonist" is defined as a drug that
  3  3 binds to opioid receptors and blocks or inhibits the effects of

  3 19 to an individual, so long as the first responder reasonably and
  3 20 in good faith believes that such individual is experiencing an

  2 22 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  2 23 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  2 24    This bill authorizes emergency medical service programs, law
  2 25 enforcement agencies, and fire departments to obtain a supply
  2 26 of opioid antagonists, and first responders to possess opioid
  2 27 antagonists for administration to drug overdose victims.
  2 28    The bill defines "first responder" as an emergency medical
  2 29 care provider, a fire fighter, or a peace officer as defined
  2 30 in Code section 801.4. The bill defines "licensed health care
  2 31 professional" as a person licensed under Code chapter 148 to
  2 32 practice medicine and surgery or osteopathic medicine and
  2 33 surgery, an advanced registered nurse practitioner licensed
  2 34 under Code chapter 152 or 152E and registered with the board of
  2 35 nursing, or a physician assistant licensed to practice under
  3  1 the supervision of a physician as authorized in Code chapters
  3  2 147 and 148C.  "Opioid antagonist" is defined as a drug that
  3  3 binds to opioid receptors and blocks or inhibits the effects of
  3  4 opioids acting on those receptors, including but not limited
  3  5 to naloxone hydrochloride or any other similarly acting drug
  3  6 approved by the United States food and drug administration.
  3  7 The bill defines "opioid=related overdose" as a condition
  3  8 affecting a person which may include extreme physical illness,
  3  9 a decreased level of consciousness, respiratory depression, a
  3 10 coma, or the ceasing of respiratory or circulatory function
  3 11 resulting from the consumption or use of an opioid, or another
  3 12 substance with which an opioid was combined.
  3 13    The bill provides that a licensed health care professional
  3 14 may prescribe an opioid antagonist in the name of a service
  3 15 program, law enforcement agency, or fire department. The
  3 16 service program, law enforcement agency, or fire department may
  3 17 maintain a supply of opioid antagonists. From that supply, a
  3 18 first responder may possess and administer an opioid antagonist
  3 19 to an individual, so long as the first responder reasonably and
  3 20 in good faith believes that such individual is experiencing an
  3 21 opioid=related overdose.
  3 22    The bill provides immunity from legal liability to any first
  3 23 responder, emergency medical service program, law enforcement
  3 24 agency, fire department, and the person who prescribed the
  3 25 opioid antagonist from any injury arising from the provision or
  3 26 administration of an opioid antagonist, so long as such person
  3 27 acted reasonably and in good faith.
  3 28    The bill directs the department of public health to adopt
  3 29 rules to implement and administer the bill, including but not
  3 30 limited to standards and procedures for the prescription,
  3 31 distribution, storage, replacement, and administration of
  3 32 opioid antagonists, and for training to be required for first
  3 33 responders to administer an opioid antagonist.
