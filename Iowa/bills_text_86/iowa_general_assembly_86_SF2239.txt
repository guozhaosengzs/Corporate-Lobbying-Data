  3 32 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  3 33 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  3 34    This bill establishes a criminal penalty for a violent
  3 35 repeat offender and reduces earned time for offenders
  4  1 required to participate in batterers' education under certain
  4  2 circumstances, provides for risk assessments, and relates to
  4  3 electronic tracking and monitoring.
  4  4    If a presentence investigation is required prior
  4  5 to sentencing, the bill requires that the presentence
  4  6 investigation include a risk assessment of the offender, if the
  4  7 offender was convicted of domestic abuse assault in violation
  4  8 of Code section 708.2A, harassment in violation of Code section
  4  9 708.7, or stalking in violation of Code section 708.11.
  4 10    The bill specifies that an offender placed on probation,

  4 32 rate of reduction of sentence for an offender who is serving
  4 33 a 70 percent sentence under Code section 902.12. However, an
  4 34 offender serving a violent repeat offender sentence is not
