  2 11                           EXPLANATION
  2 12 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  2 13 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  2 14    This bill requires an insurer to set up a demolition cost
  2 15 reserve on certain fire and casualty insurance claims received
  2 16 for damages to property located in the unincorporated area of a
  2 17 county.
  2 18    An insurer is required to notify the board of supervisors of
  2 19 the county in which the property is located when the insurer
  2 20 receives a proof of loss from a policyholder that exceeds 75
  2 21 percent of the face value of the policy covering the insured
  2 22 building or structure and damage to the property renders it
  2 23 uninhabitable or unfit for its purpose without repair. The
  2 24 insurer is also required to reserve $10,000 or 10 percent of
  2 25 the payment for damages to the property, whichever is greater,
  2 26 for demolition costs.
  2 27    The county must release all interest in the demolition
  2 28 cost reserve within 180 days after receiving notice of the
  2 29 reserve unless the county has instituted legal proceedings for
  2 30 demolition of the building or structure and has so notified
  2 31 the insurer. The reserve is no longer required if the insurer
  2 32 receives notice from both the insured and the county board
  2 33 of supervisors that the insured has completed repairs to or
  2 34 demolition of the property or if the county fails to notify the
  2 35 insurer about legal proceedings for demolition.
  3  1 If the county institutes legal proceedings, undertakes
  3  2 emergency action, or is required to demolish the damaged
  3  3 property at county expense, the county must present costs
  3  4 incurred to the insurer, and the insurer shall then compensate
  3  5 the county for those costs up to the amount of the reserve.
  3  6 Any amount left in the reserve after payment to the county is
  3  7 payable to the insured if the insured is entitled to remaining
  3  8 proceeds under the policy.
  3  9    An insurer is not liable under this provision for any amount
  3 10 in excess of the limits of liability set out by the policy.
  3 11 An insurer that complies with or attempts in good faith to
  3 12 comply with this provision is immune from civil and criminal
  3 13 liability.
  3 14    Currently this statutory provision only applies to damaged
  3 15 property which is located within the corporate limits of a city
  3 16 and such demolition costs from a reserve are payable only to
  3 17 a city.
