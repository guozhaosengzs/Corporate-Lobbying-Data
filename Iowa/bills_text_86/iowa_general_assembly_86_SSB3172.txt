EXPLANATION

The

This

13


Currently,

establish
broad
facility
standards
15


for
the

served
16


by

but
prohibits
the

from
17


establishing

standards.
The
18


bill
repeals
and
replaces
Code
chapter

The
bill
excludes

provided
by
certain

such
as
personal
friends

in
circumstances
preceding
adoption,
