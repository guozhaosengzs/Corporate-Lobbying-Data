  3 18 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  3 19 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  3 20    This bill modifies provisions that require school districts
  3 21 to retain in the third grade certain students, and adds a
  3 22 provision to require school districts to offer, under certain
  3 23 conditions, an intensive summer reading program for students in
  3 24 kindergarten through grade three whose reading is deficient.
  3 25    The bill eliminates a requirement that school districts
  3 26 retain a student in grade three if the student has been
  3 27 identified as having a substantial deficiency in reading,
  3 28 the student's parent or guardian did not enroll the student
  3 29 in an intensive summer reading program, and the student does
  3 30 not qualify for a good cause exemption.  A current provision
  3 31 that requires the state board of education to adopt standards

  3 34 promotion to grade four.  For consistency, the bill also
  3 35 changes a reference from "intensive summer literacy program" to

  4  3 guardian that the parent or guardian may enroll the student in
  4  4 an intensive summer reading program, the notification must be
  4  5 in writing.  Students continue to be exempt from participating
  4  6 in an intensive summer reading program for good cause, the
  4  7 qualifications for which are listed in Code section 279.68(5).
  4  8    The bill requires school districts to provide intensive
  4  9 summer reading programs, beginning in the summer of 2018,
  4 10 for students who are enrolled in kindergarten through grade
  4 11 two, but only if the general assembly appropriates funds for
  4 12 the programs.  The department of education may waive the

  4 16 deficiency of a student enrolled in kindergarten through grade
