  3 20 prohibition on unlicensed carrying of weapons.
  3 21    The availability of a professional or nonprofessional permit
  3 22 to carry weapons under this chapter shall not be construed

  3 24 whether openly or concealed, of a deadly weapon, including a
  3 25 loaded firearm.
  3 26                           EXPLANATION
  3 27 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  3 28 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  3 29    This bill relates to the carrying and possession of weapons
  3 30 and provides penalties.
  3 31    The bill amends Code section 708.8, the crime of going armed
  3 32 with a dangerous weapon with intent, a class "D" felony, to
  3 33 provide that the intent element required for a violation of
  3 34 this crime shall not be inferred from the mere carrying or
  3 35 concealment of a dangerous weapon.
  4  1 The bill strikes Code section 724.4 relating to the crime of
  4  2 carrying dangerous weapons, an aggravated misdemeanor, without
  4  3 a valid permit or in other enumerated circumstances. Instead,
  4  4 the bill section creates a new crime of going armed with a
  4  5 knife in the commission of a crime, an aggravated misdemeanor.
  4  6 The bill makes a conforming change to Code section 232.52,
  4  7 subsection 2, relating to the suspension or revocation of a
  4  8 juvenile's driver's license or operating privilege. The bill
  4  9 also makes a conforming Code change to Code section 724.4B,
  4 10 relating to the carrying of weapons on school grounds, to
  4 11 specifically include certain categories of persons who are
  4 12 authorized to carry weapons on school grounds.
  4 13    The bill amends Code section 724.4C relating to the crime of
  4 14 possession or carrying of firearms while under the influence
  4 15 of alcohol or a drug.  Current law invalidates a permit to
  4 16 carry weapons if the person to whom the permit is issued is
  4 17 intoxicated, as defined in Code section 321J.2, subsection 1
  4 18 (while under the influence of an alcoholic beverage or other
  4 19 drug or a combination of such substances, while having an
  4 20 alcohol concentration of .08 or more, or while any amount of a
  4 21 controlled substance is present in the person, as measured in
  4 22 the person's blood or urine).  The bill amends this provision
  4 23 to provide that a person commits a serious misdemeanor if
  4 24 the person is intoxicated and the person either carries a
  4 25 dangerous weapon on or about the person or carries a dangerous
  4 26 weapon within the person's immediate access or reach while in
  4 27 a vehicle.  This crime does not apply to situations where a
  4 28 person carries or possesses a dangerous weapon while in the
  4 29 person's own dwelling, place of business, or on the person's
  4 30 land, and the transitory possession or use of a firearm during
  4 31 an act of justified self=defense or justified defense of
  4 32 another, if the possession of the firearm lasts no longer than
  4 33 immediately necessary to resolve the emergency.
  4 34    The bill strikes Code section 724.5 relating to a person's
  4 35 duty to carry a valid permit to carry certain weapons for
  5  1 which a permit has been issued to the person and replaces that
  5  2 Code section with a provision stating that the availability
  5  3 of a professional or nonprofessional permit to carry weapons
  5  4 shall not be construed to impose a general prohibition on the
  5  5 unlicensed carrying of a deadly weapon including a loaded

  3 27 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  3 28 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  3 29    This bill relates to the carrying and possession of weapons
  3 30 and provides penalties.
  3 31    The bill amends Code section 708.8, the crime of going armed
  3 32 with a dangerous weapon with intent, a class "D" felony, to
  3 33 provide that the intent element required for a violation of
  3 34 this crime shall not be inferred from the mere carrying or
  3 35 concealment of a dangerous weapon.
  4  1 The bill strikes Code section 724.4 relating to the crime of
  4  2 carrying dangerous weapons, an aggravated misdemeanor, without
  4  3 a valid permit or in other enumerated circumstances. Instead,
  4  4 the bill section creates a new crime of going armed with a
  4  5 knife in the commission of a crime, an aggravated misdemeanor.
  4  6 The bill makes a conforming change to Code section 232.52,
  4  7 subsection 2, relating to the suspension or revocation of a
  4  8 juvenile's driver's license or operating privilege. The bill
  4  9 also makes a conforming Code change to Code section 724.4B,
  4 10 relating to the carrying of weapons on school grounds, to
  4 11 specifically include certain categories of persons who are
  4 12 authorized to carry weapons on school grounds.
  4 13    The bill amends Code section 724.4C relating to the crime of
  4 14 possession or carrying of firearms while under the influence
  4 15 of alcohol or a drug.  Current law invalidates a permit to
  4 16 carry weapons if the person to whom the permit is issued is
  4 17 intoxicated, as defined in Code section 321J.2, subsection 1
  4 18 (while under the influence of an alcoholic beverage or other
  4 19 drug or a combination of such substances, while having an
  4 20 alcohol concentration of .08 or more, or while any amount of a
  4 21 controlled substance is present in the person, as measured in
  4 22 the person's blood or urine).  The bill amends this provision
  4 23 to provide that a person commits a serious misdemeanor if
  4 24 the person is intoxicated and the person either carries a
  4 25 dangerous weapon on or about the person or carries a dangerous
  4 26 weapon within the person's immediate access or reach while in
  4 27 a vehicle.  This crime does not apply to situations where a
  4 28 person carries or possesses a dangerous weapon while in the
  4 29 person's own dwelling, place of business, or on the person's
  4 30 land, and the transitory possession or use of a firearm during
  4 31 an act of justified self=defense or justified defense of
  4 32 another, if the possession of the firearm lasts no longer than
  4 33 immediately necessary to resolve the emergency.
  4 34    The bill strikes Code section 724.5 relating to a person's
  4 35 duty to carry a valid permit to carry certain weapons for
  5  1 which a permit has been issued to the person and replaces that
  5  2 Code section with a provision stating that the availability
  5  3 of a professional or nonprofessional permit to carry weapons
  5  4 shall not be construed to impose a general prohibition on the
  5  5 unlicensed carrying of a deadly weapon including a loaded
  5  6 firearm.

  4 13    The bill amends Code section 724.4C relating to the crime of
