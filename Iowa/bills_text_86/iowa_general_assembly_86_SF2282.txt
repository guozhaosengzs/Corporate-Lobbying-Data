  6  1 date the reinstated use restrictions are recorded under section
  6  2 564B.3 or 564B.7.
  6  3    Sec. 10.  APPLICABILITY.  This Act applies to common interest
  6  4 communities created prior to, and still in existence on, July
  6  5 1, 2016, and created on or after July 1, 2016.
  6  6                           EXPLANATION
  6  7 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  6  8 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  6  9    This bill relates to the ability of a common interest
  6 10 community to reinstate lapsed use restrictions.
  6 11    The bill defines "common interest community" as real estate
  6 12 described in a declaration with respect to which a person, by
  6 13 virtue of the person's ownership of a parcel, is obligated
  6 14 to pay for a share of real estate taxes, insurance premiums,
  6 15 maintenance, improvements, services, or other expenses related
  6 16 to common elements or other real estate described in the
  6 17 declaration.
  6 18    The bill references the definition of "use restriction" in
  6 19 Code section 614.24, which is a limitation or prohibition on
  6 20 the rights of a landowner to make use of the landowner's real
  6 21 estate, including limitations or prohibitions on commercial
  6 22 uses, rental use, parking and storage of recreational vehicles
  6 23 and their attachments, ownership of pets, outdoor domestic
  6 24 uses, construction and use of accessory structures, building
  6 25 dimensions and colors, building construction materials, and
  6 26 landscaping. "Use restriction" does not include an easement
  6 27 granting a person an affirmative right to use land in the
  6 28 possession of another person, including but not limited to an
  6 29 easement for pedestrian or vehicular access, reasonable ingress
  6 30 and egress, solar access, utilities, supporting utilities,
  6 31 parking areas, bicycle paths, and water flow, an agreement
  6 32 between two or more parcel owners providing for the sharing of
  6 33 costs and other obligations for real estate taxes, insurance
  6 34 premiums, and for maintenance, repair, improvements, services,
  6 35 or other costs related to two or more parcels of real estate
  7  1 regardless of whether the parties to the agreement are owners
  7  2 of individual lots or incorporated or unincorporated lots
  7  3 or have ownership interests in common areas in a horizontal
  7  4 property regime or residential housing development, or an
  7  5 agreement between two or more parcel owners for the joint use
  7  6 and maintenance of driveways, party walls, landscaping, fences,
  7  7 wells, roads, common areas, waterways, or bodies of water.
  7  8    Under Code section 614.24, an action arising or existing
  7  9 by reason of the provisions of any contract providing for use
  7 10 restrictions in and to real estate may not be maintained after
  7 11 21 years from the recording of the contract unless a claimant
  7 12 has filed a verified claim with the county recorder within the
  7 13 21=year period. Therefore, if an owners' association or other
  7 14 claimant does not file a verified claim regarding a common
  7 15 interest community's declaration before the expiration of the
  7 16 21=year period, the use restrictions in the declaration become
  7 17 unenforceable.
  7 18    The bill enacts new Code chapter 564B to provide a mechanism
  7 19 for common interest communities to reinstate use restrictions
  7 20 which have become barred by operation of Code section 614.24.
  7 21 Use restrictions may be reinstated upon the filing with the
  7 22 county recorder of a reinstatement agreement that contains the
  7 23 complete text of the use restrictions being reinstated and
  7 24 is executed by owners of a majority of the affected parcels.
  7 25 Use restrictions may also be reinstated after an affirmative
  7 26 vote by a majority of the affected parcel owners, either at
  7 27 a meeting or by written ballot. A proposal for a vote to
  7 28 reinstate use restrictions may be brought by the executive
  7 29 board of the owners' association or by petition of parcel
  7 30 owners who own at least 10 percent of the affected parcels.
  7 31    The bill specifies the form of the notice the executive
  7 32 board shall provide to parcel owners regarding a proposal for a
  7 33 vote to reinstate use restrictions. The proposal may be voted
  7 34 upon at a meeting which shall be held no less than 14 days and
  7 35 no more than 60 days after notice was provided to the parcel
  8  1 owners. The proposal may also be voted on by written ballot.
  8  2 If the vote is by written ballot, the notice must specify when
  8  3 ballots are due, which must be no earlier than 14 days and no
  8  4 later than 60 days after the written ballots were delivered.
  8  5    Upon proper notice, if the owners of a majority of the
  8  6 affected parcels in the common interest community approve
  8  7 the reinstatement of lapsed use restrictions, the lapsed use
  8  8 restrictions are reinstated as to all parcels in the common
  8  9 interest community.
  8 10    The reinstated use restrictions become effective upon
  8 11 recordation. The reinstated use restrictions are not given
  8 12 retroactive applicability. Reinstated use restrictions
  8 13 cannot be enforced against a parcel if a parcel owner made
  8 14 a good=faith investment that would be impaired by such
  8 15 enforcement and such investment was made while the use
  8 16 restriction was unenforceable under Code section 614.24 and
  8 17 before the use restriction was reinstated under new Code
  8 18 chapter 564B.
  8 19    The bill provides that if use restrictions are reinstated
  8 20 under new Code chapter 564B, the 21=year limitation period
  8 21 under Code section 614.24 begins as of the recordation date of
  8 22 the reinstated use restrictions.
  8 23    The bill applies to common interest communities created
  8 24 prior to, and still in existence on, July 1, 2016, and created
  8 25 on or after July 1, 2016.

  6 19 Code section 614.24, which is a limitation or prohibition on
  6 20 the rights of a landowner to make use of the landowner's real
  6 21 estate, including limitations or prohibitions on commercial
  6 22 uses, rental use, parking and storage of recreational vehicles
  6 23 and their attachments, ownership of pets, outdoor domestic
  6 24 uses, construction and use of accessory structures, building
  6 25 dimensions and colors, building construction materials, and
  6 26 landscaping. "Use restriction" does not include an easement
  6 27 granting a person an affirmative right to use land in the
  6 28 possession of another person, including but not limited to an
  6 29 easement for pedestrian or vehicular access, reasonable ingress
  6 30 and egress, solar access, utilities, supporting utilities,
  6 31 parking areas, bicycle paths, and water flow, an agreement
  6 32 between two or more parcel owners providing for the sharing of
  6 33 costs and other obligations for real estate taxes, insurance
  6 34 premiums, and for maintenance, repair, improvements, services,
  6 35 or other costs related to two or more parcels of real estate
  7  1 regardless of whether the parties to the agreement are owners
  7  2 of individual lots or incorporated or unincorporated lots
  7  3 or have ownership interests in common areas in a horizontal
  7  4 property regime or residential housing development, or an
  7  5 agreement between two or more parcel owners for the joint use
  7  6 and maintenance of driveways, party walls, landscaping, fences,
  7  7 wells, roads, common areas, waterways, or bodies of water.
  7  8    Under Code section 614.24, an action arising or existing
  7  9 by reason of the provisions of any contract providing for use
  7 10 restrictions in and to real estate may not be maintained after
  7 11 21 years from the recording of the contract unless a claimant
  7 12 has filed a verified claim with the county recorder within the
  7 13 21=year period. Therefore, if an owners' association or other
  7 14 claimant does not file a verified claim regarding a common
  7 15 interest community's declaration before the expiration of the
  7 16 21=year period, the use restrictions in the declaration become
  7 17 unenforceable.
  7 18    The bill enacts new Code chapter 564B to provide a mechanism
  7 19 for common interest communities to reinstate use restrictions
  7 20 which have become barred by operation of Code section 614.24.
  7 21 Use restrictions may be reinstated upon the filing with the
  7 22 county recorder of a reinstatement agreement that contains the
  7 23 complete text of the use restrictions being reinstated and
  7 24 is executed by owners of a majority of the affected parcels.
  7 25 Use restrictions may also be reinstated after an affirmative
  7 26 vote by a majority of the affected parcel owners, either at
  7 27 a meeting or by written ballot. A proposal for a vote to
  7 28 reinstate use restrictions may be brought by the executive
  7 29 board of the owners' association or by petition of parcel
  7 30 owners who own at least 10 percent of the affected parcels.
  7 31    The bill specifies the form of the notice the executive
  7 32 board shall provide to parcel owners regarding a proposal for a
  7 33 vote to reinstate use restrictions. The proposal may be voted
  7 34 upon at a meeting which shall be held no less than 14 days and
  7 35 no more than 60 days after notice was provided to the parcel
  8  1 owners. The proposal may also be voted on by written ballot.
  8  2 If the vote is by written ballot, the notice must specify when
  8  3 ballots are due, which must be no earlier than 14 days and no
  8  4 later than 60 days after the written ballots were delivered.
  8  5    Upon proper notice, if the owners of a majority of the
  8  6 affected parcels in the common interest community approve
  8  7 the reinstatement of lapsed use restrictions, the lapsed use
  8  8 restrictions are reinstated as to all parcels in the common
  8  9 interest community.
  8 10    The reinstated use restrictions become effective upon
  8 11 recordation. The reinstated use restrictions are not given
  8 12 retroactive applicability. Reinstated use restrictions
  8 13 cannot be enforced against a parcel if a parcel owner made
  8 14 a good=faith investment that would be impaired by such
  8 15 enforcement and such investment was made while the use
  8 16 restriction was unenforceable under Code section 614.24 and
  8 17 before the use restriction was reinstated under new Code
  8 18 chapter 564B.
  8 19    The bill provides that if use restrictions are reinstated
  8 20 under new Code chapter 564B, the 21=year limitation period
  8 21 under Code section 614.24 begins as of the recordation date of
  8 22 the reinstated use restrictions.
  8 23    The bill applies to common interest communities created

  7 35 no more than 60 days after notice was provided to the parcel
  8  1 owners. The proposal may also be voted on by written ballot.

  8  5    Upon proper notice, if the owners of a majority of the
  8  6 affected parcels in the common interest community approve
  8  7 the reinstatement of lapsed use restrictions, the lapsed use
  8  8 restrictions are reinstated as to all parcels in the common
  8  9 interest community.
  8 10    The reinstated use restrictions become effective upon

  8 12 retroactive applicability. Reinstated use restrictions
  8 13 cannot be enforced against a parcel if a parcel owner made
  8 14 a good=faith investment that would be impaired by such
  8 15 enforcement and such investment was made while the use
  8 16 restriction was unenforceable under Code section 614.24 and
  8 17 before the use restriction was reinstated under new Code

  6  7 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  6  8 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  6  9    This bill relates to the ability of a common interest
  6 10 community to reinstate lapsed use restrictions.
  6 11    The bill defines "common interest community" as real estate
  6 12 described in a declaration with respect to which a person, by
  6 13 virtue of the person's ownership of a parcel, is obligated
  6 14 to pay for a share of real estate taxes, insurance premiums,
  6 15 maintenance, improvements, services, or other expenses related
  6 16 to common elements or other real estate described in the
  6 17 declaration.
  6 18    The bill references the definition of "use restriction" in
  6 19 Code section 614.24, which is a limitation or prohibition on
  6 20 the rights of a landowner to make use of the landowner's real
  6 21 estate, including limitations or prohibitions on commercial
  6 22 uses, rental use, parking and storage of recreational vehicles
  6 23 and their attachments, ownership of pets, outdoor domestic
  6 24 uses, construction and use of accessory structures, building
  6 25 dimensions and colors, building construction materials, and
  6 26 landscaping. "Use restriction" does not include an easement
  6 27 granting a person an affirmative right to use land in the
  6 28 possession of another person, including but not limited to an
  6 29 easement for pedestrian or vehicular access, reasonable ingress
  6 30 and egress, solar access, utilities, supporting utilities,
  6 31 parking areas, bicycle paths, and water flow, an agreement
  6 32 between two or more parcel owners providing for the sharing of
  6 33 costs and other obligations for real estate taxes, insurance
  6 34 premiums, and for maintenance, repair, improvements, services,
  6 35 or other costs related to two or more parcels of real estate
  7  1 regardless of whether the parties to the agreement are owners
  7  2 of individual lots or incorporated or unincorporated lots
  7  3 or have ownership interests in common areas in a horizontal
  7  4 property regime or residential housing development, or an
  7  5 agreement between two or more parcel owners for the joint use
  7  6 and maintenance of driveways, party walls, landscaping, fences,
  7  7 wells, roads, common areas, waterways, or bodies of water.
  7  8    Under Code section 614.24, an action arising or existing
  7  9 by reason of the provisions of any contract providing for use
  7 10 restrictions in and to real estate may not be maintained after
  7 11 21 years from the recording of the contract unless a claimant
  7 12 has filed a verified claim with the county recorder within the
  7 13 21=year period. Therefore, if an owners' association or other
  7 14 claimant does not file a verified claim regarding a common
  7 15 interest community's declaration before the expiration of the
  7 16 21=year period, the use restrictions in the declaration become
  7 17 unenforceable.

  7 23 complete text of the use restrictions being reinstated and
  7 24 is executed by owners of a majority of the affected parcels.
  7 25 Use restrictions may also be reinstated after an affirmative
  7 26 vote by a majority of the affected parcel owners, either at
  7 27 a meeting or by written ballot. A proposal for a vote to
  7 28 reinstate use restrictions may be brought by the executive
  7 29 board of the owners' association or by petition of parcel
  7 30 owners who own at least 10 percent of the affected parcels.
  7 31    The bill specifies the form of the notice the executive
  7 32 board shall provide to parcel owners regarding a proposal for a
  7 33 vote to reinstate use restrictions. The proposal may be voted
  7 34 upon at a meeting which shall be held no less than 14 days and
  7 35 no more than 60 days after notice was provided to the parcel
  8  1 owners. The proposal may also be voted on by written ballot.
  8  2 If the vote is by written ballot, the notice must specify when
  8  3 ballots are due, which must be no earlier than 14 days and no
  8  4 later than 60 days after the written ballots were delivered.
  8  5    Upon proper notice, if the owners of a majority of the
  8  6 affected parcels in the common interest community approve
  8  7 the reinstatement of lapsed use restrictions, the lapsed use
  8  8 restrictions are reinstated as to all parcels in the common
  8  9 interest community.
  8 10    The reinstated use restrictions become effective upon
  8 11 recordation. The reinstated use restrictions are not given
  8 12 retroactive applicability. Reinstated use restrictions
  8 13 cannot be enforced against a parcel if a parcel owner made

  8 16 restriction was unenforceable under Code section 614.24 and
  8 17 before the use restriction was reinstated under new Code
  8 18 chapter 564B.
  8 19    The bill provides that if use restrictions are reinstated
  8 20 under new Code chapter 564B, the 21=year limitation period
  8 21 under Code section 614.24 begins as of the recordation date of

  8 23    The bill applies to common interest communities created
  8 24 prior to, and still in existence on, July 1, 2016, and created

  7 21 Use restrictions may be reinstated upon the filing with the
  7 22 county recorder of a reinstatement agreement that contains the
  7 23 complete text of the use restrictions being reinstated and
  7 24 is executed by owners of a majority of the affected parcels.
  7 25 Use restrictions may also be reinstated after an affirmative
  7 26 vote by a majority of the affected parcel owners, either at
  7 27 a meeting or by written ballot. A proposal for a vote to
  7 28 reinstate use restrictions may be brought by the executive
  7 29 board of the owners' association or by petition of parcel
  7 30 owners who own at least 10 percent of the affected parcels.
  7 31    The bill specifies the form of the notice the executive
  7 32 board shall provide to parcel owners regarding a proposal for a

  7 34 upon at a meeting which shall be held no less than 14 days and
  7 35 no more than 60 days after notice was provided to the parcel
  8  1 owners. The proposal may also be voted on by written ballot.

  8  8 restrictions are reinstated as to all parcels in the common
  8  9 interest community.
  8 10    The reinstated use restrictions become effective upon

  8 12 retroactive applicability. Reinstated use restrictions
  8 13 cannot be enforced against a parcel if a parcel owner made
  8 14 a good=faith investment that would be impaired by such
  8 15 enforcement and such investment was made while the use
  8 16 restriction was unenforceable under Code section 614.24 and
  8 17 before the use restriction was reinstated under new Code

  8 19    The bill provides that if use restrictions are reinstated
  8 20 under new Code chapter 564B, the 21=year limitation period
  8 21 under Code section 614.24 begins as of the recordation date of

  6 18    The bill references the definition of "use restriction" in
  6 19 Code section 614.24, which is a limitation or prohibition on
  6 20 the rights of a landowner to make use of the landowner's real
  6 21 estate, including limitations or prohibitions on commercial
  6 22 uses, rental use, parking and storage of recreational vehicles
  6 23 and their attachments, ownership of pets, outdoor domestic
  6 24 uses, construction and use of accessory structures, building
  6 25 dimensions and colors, building construction materials, and
  6 26 landscaping. "Use restriction" does not include an easement
  6 27 granting a person an affirmative right to use land in the
  6 28 possession of another person, including but not limited to an
  6 29 easement for pedestrian or vehicular access, reasonable ingress
  6 30 and egress, solar access, utilities, supporting utilities,
  6 31 parking areas, bicycle paths, and water flow, an agreement
  6 32 between two or more parcel owners providing for the sharing of
  6 33 costs and other obligations for real estate taxes, insurance
  6 34 premiums, and for maintenance, repair, improvements, services,
  6 35 or other costs related to two or more parcels of real estate
  7  1 regardless of whether the parties to the agreement are owners
  7  2 of individual lots or incorporated or unincorporated lots
  7  3 or have ownership interests in common areas in a horizontal
  7  4 property regime or residential housing development, or an
  7  5 agreement between two or more parcel owners for the joint use
  7  6 and maintenance of driveways, party walls, landscaping, fences,
  7  7 wells, roads, common areas, waterways, or bodies of water.
  7  8    Under Code section 614.24, an action arising or existing
  7  9 by reason of the provisions of any contract providing for use
  7 10 restrictions in and to real estate may not be maintained after
  7 11 21 years from the recording of the contract unless a claimant
  7 12 has filed a verified claim with the county recorder within the
  7 13 21=year period. Therefore, if an owners' association or other
  7 14 claimant does not file a verified claim regarding a common
  7 15 interest community's declaration before the expiration of the
  7 16 21=year period, the use restrictions in the declaration become
  7 17 unenforceable.
  7 18    The bill enacts new Code chapter 564B to provide a mechanism
  7 19 for common interest communities to reinstate use restrictions
  7 20 which have become barred by operation of Code section 614.24.
  7 21 Use restrictions may be reinstated upon the filing with the
  7 22 county recorder of a reinstatement agreement that contains the
  7 23 complete text of the use restrictions being reinstated and
  7 24 is executed by owners of a majority of the affected parcels.
  7 25 Use restrictions may also be reinstated after an affirmative
  7 26 vote by a majority of the affected parcel owners, either at
  7 27 a meeting or by written ballot. A proposal for a vote to
  7 28 reinstate use restrictions may be brought by the executive
  7 29 board of the owners' association or by petition of parcel
  7 30 owners who own at least 10 percent of the affected parcels.
  7 31    The bill specifies the form of the notice the executive
  7 32 board shall provide to parcel owners regarding a proposal for a
  7 33 vote to reinstate use restrictions. The proposal may be voted
  7 34 upon at a meeting which shall be held no less than 14 days and
  7 35 no more than 60 days after notice was provided to the parcel
  8  1 owners. The proposal may also be voted on by written ballot.
  8  2 If the vote is by written ballot, the notice must specify when
  8  3 ballots are due, which must be no earlier than 14 days and no
  8  4 later than 60 days after the written ballots were delivered.
  8  5    Upon proper notice, if the owners of a majority of the
  8  6 affected parcels in the common interest community approve
  8  7 the reinstatement of lapsed use restrictions, the lapsed use
  8  8 restrictions are reinstated as to all parcels in the common
  8  9 interest community.
  8 10    The reinstated use restrictions become effective upon
  8 11 recordation. The reinstated use restrictions are not given
  8 12 retroactive applicability. Reinstated use restrictions
  8 13 cannot be enforced against a parcel if a parcel owner made
  8 14 a good=faith investment that would be impaired by such
  8 15 enforcement and such investment was made while the use
  8 16 restriction was unenforceable under Code section 614.24 and
  8 17 before the use restriction was reinstated under new Code
  8 18 chapter 564B.
  8 19    The bill provides that if use restrictions are reinstated
  8 20 under new Code chapter 564B, the 21=year limitation period
  8 21 under Code section 614.24 begins as of the recordation date of

  7 21 Use restrictions may be reinstated upon the filing with the
  7 22 county recorder of a reinstatement agreement that contains the
  7 23 complete text of the use restrictions being reinstated and
  7 24 is executed by owners of a majority of the affected parcels.
  7 25 Use restrictions may also be reinstated after an affirmative

  7 28 reinstate use restrictions may be brought by the executive
  7 29 board of the owners' association or by petition of parcel
  7 30 owners who own at least 10 percent of the affected parcels.

  7 34 upon at a meeting which shall be held no less than 14 days and
  7 35 no more than 60 days after notice was provided to the parcel
  8  1 owners. The proposal may also be voted on by written ballot.

  8  3 ballots are due, which must be no earlier than 14 days and no

  8  8 restrictions are reinstated as to all parcels in the common
  8  9 interest community.
  8 10    The reinstated use restrictions become effective upon

  8 12 retroactive applicability. Reinstated use restrictions
  8 13 cannot be enforced against a parcel if a parcel owner made
  8 14 a good=faith investment that would be impaired by such
  8 15 enforcement and such investment was made while the use
  8 16 restriction was unenforceable under Code section 614.24 and
