  7 15 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  7 16 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  7 17    This bill creates an electric or natural gas vehicle
  7 18 facility tax credit for persons who construct, install, and
  7 19 place in service an electric vehicle facility or a natural
  7 20 gas vehicle facility. The amount of the tax credit is 30
  7 21 percent of the total cost of purchasing and of installing the
  7 22 facility. A person may claim the tax credit on an agricultural
  7 23 (farmer), commercial (business), or residential (personal,
  7 24 family, or household) basis. The bill provides that $5 million
  7 25 is dedicated for the issuance of tax credit certificates which
  7 26 must be attached to a person's tax return in order to claim
  7 27 the tax credit. The bill establishes limits upon the amount
  7 28 of credit that a person may claim for either electric vehicle
  7 29 facilities or natural gas facilities. A person claiming the
  7 30 tax credit on an agricultural or commercial basis may claim
  7 31 the tax credit for the installation of an electric or natural
  7 32 gas facility. The person must claim one=third of the tax
  7 33 credit for each of three tax years. A person claiming the tax
  7 34 credit on a residential basis may claim the tax credit for the
  7 35 installation of an electric vehicle facility. The person must
  8  1 claim the tax credit in the tax year in which the electric
  8  2 vehicle facility was first placed in service. Any tax credit
  8  3 in excess of the taxpayer's tax liability is refundable or may
  8  4 be used in calculating a future tax liability.
  8  5    The taxpayer must place the facility in service before
  8  6 January 1, 2018, but those taxpayers claiming on an
  8  7 agricultural or commercial basis may claim the tax credit for a
  8  8 previous installation after that date.
  8  9    The aggregate amount of electric or natural gas vehicle
  8 10 facility tax credit certificates that may be issued cannot
  8 11 exceed $5 million for all tax years that the tax credit
  8 12 is available. Two million dollars is allocated to support
  8 13 electric vehicle facilities, $2 million is allocated to support
  8 14 natural gas facilities, and $1 million is allocated to support
  8 15 either electric vehicle facilities or natural gas vehicle
  8 16 facilities. As of July 1, 2017, any remaining encumbered or
  8 17 expended moneys are also allocated to support either type of
  8 18 facility.
  8 19    The tax credit applies retroactively to tax years beginning
  8 20 on and after January 1, 2015. The bill's provisions are
  8 21 repealed on January 1, 2020. The bill takes effect upon

  7 17    This bill creates an electric or natural gas vehicle
  7 18 facility tax credit for persons who construct, install, and
  7 19 place in service an electric vehicle facility or a natural
  7 20 gas vehicle facility. The amount of the tax credit is 30

  7 22 facility. A person may claim the tax credit on an agricultural
  7 23 (farmer), commercial (business), or residential (personal,
  7 24 family, or household) basis. The bill provides that $5 million
  7 25 is dedicated for the issuance of tax credit certificates which
  7 26 must be attached to a person's tax return in order to claim
  7 27 the tax credit. The bill establishes limits upon the amount
  7 28 of credit that a person may claim for either electric vehicle
  7 29 facilities or natural gas facilities. A person claiming the

  7 31 the tax credit for the installation of an electric or natural

  7 33 credit for each of three tax years. A person claiming the tax

  8  1 claim the tax credit in the tax year in which the electric
  8  2 vehicle facility was first placed in service. Any tax credit
  8  3 in excess of the taxpayer's tax liability is refundable or may
  8  4 be used in calculating a future tax liability.
  8  5    The taxpayer must place the facility in service before
  8  6 January 1, 2018, but those taxpayers claiming on an
  8  7 agricultural or commercial basis may claim the tax credit for a
  8  8 previous installation after that date.
  8  9    The aggregate amount of electric or natural gas vehicle
  8 10 facility tax credit certificates that may be issued cannot
  8 11 exceed $5 million for all tax years that the tax credit

  8 13 electric vehicle facilities, $2 million is allocated to support
  8 14 natural gas facilities, and $1 million is allocated to support
  8 15 either electric vehicle facilities or natural gas vehicle
  8 16 facilities. As of July 1, 2017, any remaining encumbered or
  8 17 expended moneys are also allocated to support either type of
  8 18 facility.
  8 19    The tax credit applies retroactively to tax years beginning

  7 17    This bill creates an electric or natural gas vehicle
  7 18 facility tax credit for persons who construct, install, and
  7 19 place in service an electric vehicle facility or a natural
  7 20 gas vehicle facility. The amount of the tax credit is 30

  7 22 facility. A person may claim the tax credit on an agricultural
  7 23 (farmer), commercial (business), or residential (personal,
  7 24 family, or household) basis. The bill provides that $5 million
  7 25 is dedicated for the issuance of tax credit certificates which
  7 26 must be attached to a person's tax return in order to claim
  7 27 the tax credit. The bill establishes limits upon the amount
  7 28 of credit that a person may claim for either electric vehicle
  7 29 facilities or natural gas facilities. A person claiming the

  7 33 credit for each of three tax years. A person claiming the tax

  8  1 claim the tax credit in the tax year in which the electric
  8  2 vehicle facility was first placed in service. Any tax credit
  8  3 in excess of the taxpayer's tax liability is refundable or may
  8  4 be used in calculating a future tax liability.
  8  5    The taxpayer must place the facility in service before
  8  6 January 1, 2018, but those taxpayers claiming on an
  8  7 agricultural or commercial basis may claim the tax credit for a
  8  8 previous installation after that date.
  8  9    The aggregate amount of electric or natural gas vehicle
  8 10 facility tax credit certificates that may be issued cannot
  8 11 exceed $5 million for all tax years that the tax credit
  8 12 is available. Two million dollars is allocated to support
  8 13 electric vehicle facilities, $2 million is allocated to support
  8 14 natural gas facilities, and $1 million is allocated to support
  8 15 either electric vehicle facilities or natural gas vehicle
  8 16 facilities. As of July 1, 2017, any remaining encumbered or
  8 17 expended moneys are also allocated to support either type of
