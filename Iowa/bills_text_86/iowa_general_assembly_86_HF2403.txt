  2 26 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  2 27 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  2 28    This bill prohibits hunting, taking, or attempting to take
  2 29 deer on or in a baited area. The bill also requires that
  2 30 if a person places feed in a baited area, all feed must be
  2 31 removed from that area at least 10 days before the opening
  2 32 day of the first fall deer hunting season. An area remains
  2 33 a baited area for 10 days following complete removal of all
  2 34 feed from the area, except for salt, minerals, or any other
  2 35 feed that will dissolve and leach into the soil, in which case
  3  1 the area is considered a permanently baited area until such
  3  2 time as all contaminated soil is removed or until there is no
  3  3 longer evidence that deer are artificially attracted to or are
  3  4 accessing the site.  A person shall not hunt, take, or attempt
  3  5 to take deer within 200 yards of a permanently baited area
  3  6 until such time as all contaminated soil is removed from the
  3  7 area or until there is no evidence that deer are artificially
  3  8 attracted to or are accessing the area.
  3  9    If salt, minerals, or any other feed that will dissolve
  3 10 and leach into the soil is placed in an area for agricultural
  3 11 purposes, that area is not considered a baited area or a
  3 12 permanently baited area.
  3 13    A person shall not establish a baited area or place, expose,
  3 14 deposit, distribute, or scatter feed in an area with the
  3 15 intent to prevent or disrupt the hunting activities of another
  3 16 person.  A violation of this provision constitutes intentional
  3 17 interference with lawful hunting under section 481A.125 and is
  3 18 punishable as a simple misdemeanor for a first offense and as
  3 19 a serious misdemeanor for any subsequent offense.  A simple
  3 20 misdemeanor is punishable by confinement for no more than 30
  3 21 days or a fine of at least $65 but not more than $625 or by
  3 22 both.  A serious misdemeanor is punishable by confinement for
  3 23 no more than one year and a fine of at least $315 but not more
  3 24 than $1,875.
  3 25    For purposes of the bill, "feed" is grain, fruit,
  3 26 vegetables, nuts, hay, salt, mineral blocks, or any other
  3 27 natural food materials; commercial products containing natural
  3 28 food materials; or by=products of such materials, that are
  3 29 capable of luring, attracting, or enticing wildlife to a
  3 30 specific location. "Feed" does not include food placed during
  3 31 normal agricultural activities including but not limited to
  3 32 feed placed for livestock that are present and are actively
  3 33 consuming the feed on a regular basis; incidental feeding
  3 34 of wildlife within an active livestock operation; crops
  3 35 planted and left standing as food plots for wildlife; grain
  4  1 or other feed scattered or distributed as a result of normal
  4  2 agricultural, gardening, soil stabilization, or logging
  4  3 practices; or vegetation or other feed that is naturally
  4  4 deposited in an area. A "baited area" is any area where feed
  4  5 is placed, exposed, deposited, distributed, or scattered with
  4  6 the intent to lure, attract, or entice wildlife to a specific
  4  7 location.
