  8 23                           EXPLANATION
  8 24 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  8 25 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  8 26    This bill relates to the establishment, operation, and
  8 27 dissolution of rural improvement zones under Code chapter 357H.
  8 28    Current law provides that the population threshold for
  8 29 establishing a rural improvement zone is determined using
  8 30 the 2000 certified federal census.  The bill changes that
  8 31 requirement so that the population is determined using the
  8 32 most recent certified federal census.  The bill also adds a
  8 33 definition of "lake" for purposes of determining eligibility to
  8 34 establish a rural improvement zone.  The bill defines "lake"
  8 35 to mean a body of water that has a surface area of at least 80
  9  1 acres.
  9  2    The bill adds water quality measures to the definition of
  9  3 "improvements".  Under Code chapter 357H, the board of trustees
  9  4 may authorize construction, reconstruction, or repair of
  9  5 improvements for the rural improvement zone.
  9  6    The bill provides that as part of the approval process for a
  9  7 rural improvement zone, the petition must include a statement
  9  8 of the need for the proposed zone based upon a report prepared
  9  9 by a licensed professional engineer.  The report utilized
  9 10 in preparing the petition must have been prepared not more
  9 11 than two years before the date the petition is filed. The
  9 12 information required to be included in the engineer's report
  9 13 relates to the size of the lake, soil classification, silt
  9 14 accumulation data and estimates, water quality assessments,
  9 15 and cost estimates. The bill requires a copy of the report
  9 16 prepared by the licensed professional engineer and used to
  9 17 prepare the petition to be submitted with the petition.
  9 18    The bill changes the period of time required for holding
  9 19 a public hearing on the petition from within 30 days
  9 20 of presentation of the petition to within 60 days.  In
  9 21 addition, the bill provides that if the board of supervisors
  9 22 determines that the petition or the engineer's report does
  9 23 not substantially meet the statutory requirements, the
  9 24 board may, within 30 days of presentation of the petition,
  9 25 request additional information from the petitioners. The
  9 26 board's request for additional information is limited to the
  9 27 statutorily required information that was not contained in the
  9 28 petition or in the accompanying engineer's report. The bill
  9 29 limits the board to one request for additional information.
  9 30 Upon presentation of the additional information, the public
  9 31 hearing must be held within 60 days of receiving the additional
  9 32 information.
  9 33    The bill strikes the provision which prohibited the issuance
  9 34 of certificates for the payment of a rural improvement zone's
  9 35 improvements and activities after January 1, 2007, and provides
 10  1 that such certificates, including certificates to refund
 10  2 outstanding certificates, may not be issued if the maturity
 10  3 date of the certificates would be after the date the rural
 10  4 improvement zone is to be dissolved, as provided by the bill.
 10  5    Current Code section 357H.9 authorizes rural improvement
 10  6 zones to authorize the use of taxes from a division of taxes
 10  7 (tax increment financing).  The bill provides that for fiscal
 10  8 years beginning on or after July 1, 2016, when calculating
 10  9 the amount of taxes subject to the division of taxes, if the
 10 10 assessed value of the taxable property in the rural improvement
 10 11 zone used to calculate the amount of taxes to be paid to the
 10 12 other taxing districts is less than 50 percent of the assessed
 10 13 value of the taxable property in the rural improvement zone
 10 14 used to calculate the total amount of property taxes in the
 10 15 rural improvement zone for the fiscal year in which the taxes
 10 16 are due and payable, the assessed value of the taxable property
 10 17 in the rural improvement zone used to calculate the amount of
 10 18 taxes to be paid to the other taxing districts (base value)
 10 19 shall be increased for that fiscal year to an amount equal to
 10 20 50 percent of the assessed value of the taxable property in the
 10 21 rural improvement zone used to calculate the total amount of
 10 22 property taxes in the rural improvement zone for the fiscal
 10 23 year in which the taxes are due and payable.
 10 24    The bill provides that for fiscal years beginning on or after
 10 25 July 1, 2016, when determining the assessed value of property
 10 26 within a rural improvement zone that is subject to a division
 10 27 of tax revenues, the requirement under Code section 403.20
 10 28 that the valuation reductions (rollback) first be subtracted
 10 29 from the assessed value of the property as determined pursuant
 10 30 to Code section 403.19(1) (base value), does not apply and
 10 31 provides that the rollbacks for that year shall instead be
 10 32 applied uniformly, by class of property, to all actual value
 10 33 in the rural improvement zone.
 10 34    The bill provides that not later than December 1 of each
 10 35 year the board of trustees of a zone shall file with the
 11  1 county auditor an annual financial report showing the rural
 11  2 improvement zone's financial condition as of June 30 and the
 11  3 results of operations for the year then ended.  The bill also
 11  4 provides that all rural improvement zones are subject to annual
 11  5 audit either by the auditor of state or by a certified public
 11  6 accountant contracted with or employed by the rural improvement
 11  7 zone to conduct the audit.
 11  8    The bill provides that, unless dissolved by resolution of
 11  9 the board of trustees, each rural improvement zone is dissolved
 11 10 on June 30, 2019, or 20 years from the first day of the fiscal
 11 11 year following the fiscal year in which the zone first receives
 11 12 revenue from the division of taxes, whichever is later.  The
 11 13 bill further provides that the date required for dissolution
 11 14 may be extended by resolution of the board of supervisors
 11 15 adopted prior to the date required for dissolution or prior to
 11 16 the date to which the rural improvement zone was previously
 11 17 extended by the board of supervisors under the provisions of
 11 18 the bill.  Each extension shall be for a period of 20 years.
 11 19    The bill updates language relating to the disposition of
 11 20 property upon dissolution of the zone and specifies that any
 11 21 collection of, or division of, property taxes under Code
 11 22 chapter 357H ceases immediately upon dissolution of the zone.
 11 23    Under the bill, the rural improvement zone's board of
 11 24 trustees must file a petition with the board of supervisors
 11 25 requesting an extension of the dissolution date. The petition
 11 26 must state the continued need for the rural improvement zone
 11 27 and describe the improvements needed in the zone beyond the
 11 28 dissolution date otherwise required by the bill. Within 90
 11 29 days after receiving the petition, the board of supervisors
 11 30 must either adopt a resolution granting the 20=year extension
 11 31 without further proceedings, or notify the board of trustees in
 11 32 writing of the board's intent to review the zone's dissolution
 11 33 date.  The board may, as part of its notice to the board of
 11 34 trustees, request a report prepared by a licensed professional
 11 35 engineer.  If the board fails to either approve the extension
 12  1 by resolution or notify the board of trustees of the board's
 12  2 intent to review the zone's dissolution date within the 90=day
 12  3 period, the request for a 20=year extension is deemed approved.
 12  4 The board of supervisors requests additional information from
 12  5 the board of trustees. As part of the board of supervisors'
 12  6 further review of the petition, a public hearing must be held
 12  7 within the period of time specified in the bill.  Within
 12  8 10 days after the public hearing, the board of supervisors
 12  9 is required to either find a continued need for the rural
 12 10 improvement zone and adopt a resolution approving the 20=year
 12 11 extension or find that the continued operation of the rural
 12 12 improvement zone is not necessary and deny the request for an
 12 13 extension.  If the board fails to either approve or deny the
 12 14 extension within the 10=day period, the request for a 20=year
 12 15 extension is deemed approved.
 12 16    The bill provides that any agreement or other instrument in
 12 17 connection with an agreement between a board of trustees and a
 12 18 board in existence on July 1, 2015, relating to the division
 12 19 of taxes, the dissolution date of a rural improvement zone, or
 12 20 the criteria used for determining the continued existence of
 12 21 a rural improvement zone that is inconsistent with this Code
 12 22 chapter shall be null and void.

 11  5 audit either by the auditor of state or by a certified public
 11  6 accountant contracted with or employed by the rural improvement
 11  7 zone to conduct the audit.
 11  8    The bill provides that, unless dissolved by resolution of
 11  9 the board of trustees, each rural improvement zone is dissolved
 11 10 on June 30, 2019, or 20 years from the first day of the fiscal
 11 11 year following the fiscal year in which the zone first receives
 11 12 revenue from the division of taxes, whichever is later.  The
 11 13 bill further provides that the date required for dissolution
 11 14 may be extended by resolution of the board of supervisors
 11 15 adopted prior to the date required for dissolution or prior to
 11 16 the date to which the rural improvement zone was previously
 11 17 extended by the board of supervisors under the provisions of
 11 18 the bill.  Each extension shall be for a period of 20 years.
 11 19    The bill updates language relating to the disposition of
 11 20 property upon dissolution of the zone and specifies that any
 11 21 collection of, or division of, property taxes under Code
 11 22 chapter 357H ceases immediately upon dissolution of the zone.
 11 23    Under the bill, the rural improvement zone's board of
 11 24 trustees must file a petition with the board of supervisors
 11 25 requesting an extension of the dissolution date. The petition
 11 26 must state the continued need for the rural improvement zone
 11 27 and describe the improvements needed in the zone beyond the
 11 28 dissolution date otherwise required by the bill. Within 90
 11 29 days after receiving the petition, the board of supervisors
 11 30 must either adopt a resolution granting the 20=year extension
 11 31 without further proceedings, or notify the board of trustees in
 11 32 writing of the board's intent to review the zone's dissolution
 11 33 date.  The board may, as part of its notice to the board of
 11 34 trustees, request a report prepared by a licensed professional
 11 35 engineer.  If the board fails to either approve the extension
 12  1 by resolution or notify the board of trustees of the board's
 12  2 intent to review the zone's dissolution date within the 90=day
 12  3 period, the request for a 20=year extension is deemed approved.
 12  4 The board of supervisors requests additional information from
 12  5 the board of trustees. As part of the board of supervisors'
 12  6 further review of the petition, a public hearing must be held
 12  7 within the period of time specified in the bill.  Within
 12  8 10 days after the public hearing, the board of supervisors
 12  9 is required to either find a continued need for the rural
 12 10 improvement zone and adopt a resolution approving the 20=year
 12 11 extension or find that the continued operation of the rural
 12 12 improvement zone is not necessary and deny the request for an
 12 13 extension.  If the board fails to either approve or deny the
 12 14 extension within the 10=day period, the request for a 20=year
 12 15 extension is deemed approved.
 12 16    The bill provides that any agreement or other instrument in
 12 17 connection with an agreement between a board of trustees and a
 12 18 board in existence on July 1, 2015, relating to the division
 12 19 of taxes, the dissolution date of a rural improvement zone, or
 12 20 the criteria used for determining the continued existence of
 12 21 a rural improvement zone that is inconsistent with this Code

  8 23                           EXPLANATION
  8 24 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  8 25 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  8 26    This bill relates to the establishment, operation, and
  8 27 dissolution of rural improvement zones under Code chapter 357H.
  8 28    Current law provides that the population threshold for
  8 29 establishing a rural improvement zone is determined using
  8 30 the 2000 certified federal census.  The bill changes that
  8 31 requirement so that the population is determined using the
  8 32 most recent certified federal census.  The bill also adds a
  8 33 definition of "lake" for purposes of determining eligibility to
  8 34 establish a rural improvement zone.  The bill defines "lake"
  8 35 to mean a body of water that has a surface area of at least 80
  9  1 acres.
  9  2    The bill adds water quality measures to the definition of
  9  3 "improvements".  Under Code chapter 357H, the board of trustees
  9  4 may authorize construction, reconstruction, or repair of
  9  5 improvements for the rural improvement zone.
  9  6    The bill provides that as part of the approval process for a
  9  7 rural improvement zone, the petition must include a statement
  9  8 of the need for the proposed zone based upon a report prepared
  9  9 by a licensed professional engineer.  The report utilized
  9 10 in preparing the petition must have been prepared not more
  9 11 than two years before the date the petition is filed. The
  9 12 information required to be included in the engineer's report
  9 13 relates to the size of the lake, soil classification, silt
  9 14 accumulation data and estimates, water quality assessments,
  9 15 and cost estimates. The bill requires a copy of the report
  9 16 prepared by the licensed professional engineer and used to
  9 17 prepare the petition to be submitted with the petition.
  9 18    The bill changes the period of time required for holding
  9 19 a public hearing on the petition from within 30 days
  9 20 of presentation of the petition to within 60 days.  In
  9 21 addition, the bill provides that if the board of supervisors
  9 22 determines that the petition or the engineer's report does
  9 23 not substantially meet the statutory requirements, the
  9 24 board may, within 30 days of presentation of the petition,
  9 25 request additional information from the petitioners. The
  9 26 board's request for additional information is limited to the
  9 27 statutorily required information that was not contained in the
  9 28 petition or in the accompanying engineer's report. The bill
  9 29 limits the board to one request for additional information.
  9 30 Upon presentation of the additional information, the public
  9 31 hearing must be held within 60 days of receiving the additional
  9 32 information.
  9 33    The bill strikes the provision which prohibited the issuance
  9 34 of certificates for the payment of a rural improvement zone's
  9 35 improvements and activities after January 1, 2007, and provides
 10  1 that such certificates, including certificates to refund
 10  2 outstanding certificates, may not be issued if the maturity
 10  3 date of the certificates would be after the date the rural
 10  4 improvement zone is to be dissolved, as provided by the bill.
 10  5    Current Code section 357H.9 authorizes rural improvement
 10  6 zones to authorize the use of taxes from a division of taxes
 10  7 (tax increment financing).  The bill provides that for fiscal
 10  8 years beginning on or after July 1, 2016, when calculating
 10  9 the amount of taxes subject to the division of taxes, if the
 10 10 assessed value of the taxable property in the rural improvement
 10 11 zone used to calculate the amount of taxes to be paid to the
 10 12 other taxing districts is less than 50 percent of the assessed
 10 13 value of the taxable property in the rural improvement zone
 10 14 used to calculate the total amount of property taxes in the
 10 15 rural improvement zone for the fiscal year in which the taxes
 10 16 are due and payable, the assessed value of the taxable property
 10 17 in the rural improvement zone used to calculate the amount of
 10 18 taxes to be paid to the other taxing districts (base value)
 10 19 shall be increased for that fiscal year to an amount equal to
 10 20 50 percent of the assessed value of the taxable property in the
 10 21 rural improvement zone used to calculate the total amount of
 10 22 property taxes in the rural improvement zone for the fiscal
 10 23 year in which the taxes are due and payable.
 10 24    The bill provides that for fiscal years beginning on or after
 10 25 July 1, 2016, when determining the assessed value of property
 10 26 within a rural improvement zone that is subject to a division
 10 27 of tax revenues, the requirement under Code section 403.20
 10 28 that the valuation reductions (rollback) first be subtracted
 10 29 from the assessed value of the property as determined pursuant
 10 30 to Code section 403.19(1) (base value), does not apply and
 10 31 provides that the rollbacks for that year shall instead be
 10 32 applied uniformly, by class of property, to all actual value
 10 33 in the rural improvement zone.
 10 34    The bill provides that not later than December 1 of each
 10 35 year the board of trustees of a zone shall file with the
 11  1 county auditor an annual financial report showing the rural
 11  2 improvement zone's financial condition as of June 30 and the
 11  3 results of operations for the year then ended.  The bill also
 11  4 provides that all rural improvement zones are subject to annual
 11  5 audit either by the auditor of state or by a certified public
 11  6 accountant contracted with or employed by the rural improvement
 11  7 zone to conduct the audit.
 11  8    The bill provides that, unless dissolved by resolution of
 11  9 the board of trustees, each rural improvement zone is dissolved
 11 10 on June 30, 2019, or 20 years from the first day of the fiscal
 11 11 year following the fiscal year in which the zone first receives
 11 12 revenue from the division of taxes, whichever is later.  The
 11 13 bill further provides that the date required for dissolution
 11 14 may be extended by resolution of the board of supervisors
 11 15 adopted prior to the date required for dissolution or prior to
 11 16 the date to which the rural improvement zone was previously
 11 17 extended by the board of supervisors under the provisions of
 11 18 the bill.  Each extension shall be for a period of 20 years.
 11 19    The bill updates language relating to the disposition of
 11 20 property upon dissolution of the zone and specifies that any
 11 21 collection of, or division of, property taxes under Code
 11 22 chapter 357H ceases immediately upon dissolution of the zone.
 11 23    Under the bill, the rural improvement zone's board of
 11 24 trustees must file a petition with the board of supervisors
 11 25 requesting an extension of the dissolution date. The petition
 11 26 must state the continued need for the rural improvement zone
 11 27 and describe the improvements needed in the zone beyond the
 11 28 dissolution date otherwise required by the bill. Within 90
 11 29 days after receiving the petition, the board of supervisors
 11 30 must either adopt a resolution granting the 20=year extension
 11 31 without further proceedings, or notify the board of trustees in
 11 32 writing of the board's intent to review the zone's dissolution
 11 33 date.  The board may, as part of its notice to the board of
 11 34 trustees, request a report prepared by a licensed professional
 11 35 engineer.  If the board fails to either approve the extension
 12  1 by resolution or notify the board of trustees of the board's
 12  2 intent to review the zone's dissolution date within the 90=day
 12  3 period, the request for a 20=year extension is deemed approved.
 12  4 The board of supervisors requests additional information from
 12  5 the board of trustees. As part of the board of supervisors'
 12  6 further review of the petition, a public hearing must be held
 12  7 within the period of time specified in the bill.  Within
 12  8 10 days after the public hearing, the board of supervisors
 12  9 is required to either find a continued need for the rural
 12 10 improvement zone and adopt a resolution approving the 20=year
 12 11 extension or find that the continued operation of the rural
 12 12 improvement zone is not necessary and deny the request for an
 12 13 extension.  If the board fails to either approve or deny the
 12 14 extension within the 10=day period, the request for a 20=year
 12 15 extension is deemed approved.
 12 16    The bill provides that any agreement or other instrument in

 10 14 used to calculate the total amount of property taxes in the
 10 15 rural improvement zone for the fiscal year in which the taxes
 10 16 are due and payable, the assessed value of the taxable property
 10 17 in the rural improvement zone used to calculate the amount of
 10 18 taxes to be paid to the other taxing districts (base value)
 10 19 shall be increased for that fiscal year to an amount equal to
 10 20 50 percent of the assessed value of the taxable property in the
 10 21 rural improvement zone used to calculate the total amount of
 10 22 property taxes in the rural improvement zone for the fiscal
 10 23 year in which the taxes are due and payable.
 10 24    The bill provides that for fiscal years beginning on or after
 10 25 July 1, 2016, when determining the assessed value of property
 10 26 within a rural improvement zone that is subject to a division
 10 27 of tax revenues, the requirement under Code section 403.20
 10 28 that the valuation reductions (rollback) first be subtracted
 10 29 from the assessed value of the property as determined pursuant
 10 30 to Code section 403.19(1) (base value), does not apply and
 10 31 provides that the rollbacks for that year shall instead be
 10 32 applied uniformly, by class of property, to all actual value
 10 33 in the rural improvement zone.
 10 34    The bill provides that not later than December 1 of each
 10 35 year the board of trustees of a zone shall file with the
 11  1 county auditor an annual financial report showing the rural
 11  2 improvement zone's financial condition as of June 30 and the
 11  3 results of operations for the year then ended.  The bill also
 11  4 provides that all rural improvement zones are subject to annual
 11  5 audit either by the auditor of state or by a certified public
 11  6 accountant contracted with or employed by the rural improvement
 11  7 zone to conduct the audit.
 11  8    The bill provides that, unless dissolved by resolution of
 11  9 the board of trustees, each rural improvement zone is dissolved
 11 10 on June 30, 2019, or 20 years from the first day of the fiscal
 11 11 year following the fiscal year in which the zone first receives
 11 12 revenue from the division of taxes, whichever is later.  The
 11 13 bill further provides that the date required for dissolution
 11 14 may be extended by resolution of the board of supervisors
 11 15 adopted prior to the date required for dissolution or prior to
 11 16 the date to which the rural improvement zone was previously
 11 17 extended by the board of supervisors under the provisions of
 11 18 the bill.  Each extension shall be for a period of 20 years.
 11 19    The bill updates language relating to the disposition of
 11 20 property upon dissolution of the zone and specifies that any
 11 21 collection of, or division of, property taxes under Code
 11 22 chapter 357H ceases immediately upon dissolution of the zone.
 11 23    Under the bill, the rural improvement zone's board of
 11 24 trustees must file a petition with the board of supervisors
 11 25 requesting an extension of the dissolution date. The petition
 11 26 must state the continued need for the rural improvement zone
 11 27 and describe the improvements needed in the zone beyond the
 11 28 dissolution date otherwise required by the bill. Within 90
 11 29 days after receiving the petition, the board of supervisors
 11 30 must either adopt a resolution granting the 20=year extension
 11 31 without further proceedings, or notify the board of trustees in
 11 32 writing of the board's intent to review the zone's dissolution
 11 33 date.  The board may, as part of its notice to the board of
 11 34 trustees, request a report prepared by a licensed professional
 11 35 engineer.  If the board fails to either approve the extension
 12  1 by resolution or notify the board of trustees of the board's
 12  2 intent to review the zone's dissolution date within the 90=day
 12  3 period, the request for a 20=year extension is deemed approved.
 12  4 The board of supervisors requests additional information from
 12  5 the board of trustees. As part of the board of supervisors'
 12  6 further review of the petition, a public hearing must be held
 12  7 within the period of time specified in the bill.  Within
 12  8 10 days after the public hearing, the board of supervisors
 12  9 is required to either find a continued need for the rural
 12 10 improvement zone and adopt a resolution approving the 20=year
 12 11 extension or find that the continued operation of the rural
 12 12 improvement zone is not necessary and deny the request for an
 12 13 extension.  If the board fails to either approve or deny the
 12 14 extension within the 10=day period, the request for a 20=year
 12 15 extension is deemed approved.
 12 16    The bill provides that any agreement or other instrument in
 12 17 connection with an agreement between a board of trustees and a
 12 18 board in existence on July 1, 2015, relating to the division
 12 19 of taxes, the dissolution date of a rural improvement zone, or
 12 20 the criteria used for determining the continued existence of
 12 21 a rural improvement zone that is inconsistent with this Code
 12 22 chapter shall be null and void.

  8 23                           EXPLANATION
  8 24 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  8 25 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  8 26    This bill relates to the establishment, operation, and
  8 27 dissolution of rural improvement zones under Code chapter 357H.
  8 28    Current law provides that the population threshold for
  8 29 establishing a rural improvement zone is determined using
  8 30 the 2000 certified federal census.  The bill changes that
  8 31 requirement so that the population is determined using the
  8 32 most recent certified federal census.  The bill also adds a
  8 33 definition of "lake" for purposes of determining eligibility to
  8 34 establish a rural improvement zone.  The bill defines "lake"
  8 35 to mean a body of water that has a surface area of at least 80
  9  1 acres.
  9  2    The bill adds water quality measures to the definition of
  9  3 "improvements".  Under Code chapter 357H, the board of trustees
  9  4 may authorize construction, reconstruction, or repair of
  9  5 improvements for the rural improvement zone.
  9  6    The bill provides that as part of the approval process for a
  9  7 rural improvement zone, the petition must include a statement
  9  8 of the need for the proposed zone based upon a report prepared
  9  9 by a licensed professional engineer.  The report utilized
  9 10 in preparing the petition must have been prepared not more
  9 11 than two years before the date the petition is filed. The
  9 12 information required to be included in the engineer's report
  9 13 relates to the size of the lake, soil classification, silt
  9 14 accumulation data and estimates, water quality assessments,
  9 15 and cost estimates. The bill requires a copy of the report
  9 16 prepared by the licensed professional engineer and used to
  9 17 prepare the petition to be submitted with the petition.
  9 18    The bill changes the period of time required for holding
  9 19 a public hearing on the petition from within 30 days
  9 20 of presentation of the petition to within 60 days.  In
  9 21 addition, the bill provides that if the board of supervisors
  9 22 determines that the petition or the engineer's report does
  9 23 not substantially meet the statutory requirements, the
  9 24 board may, within 30 days of presentation of the petition,
  9 25 request additional information from the petitioners. The
  9 26 board's request for additional information is limited to the
  9 27 statutorily required information that was not contained in the
  9 28 petition or in the accompanying engineer's report. The bill
  9 29 limits the board to one request for additional information.
  9 30 Upon presentation of the additional information, the public
  9 31 hearing must be held within 60 days of receiving the additional
  9 32 information.
  9 33    The bill strikes the provision which prohibited the issuance
  9 34 of certificates for the payment of a rural improvement zone's
  9 35 improvements and activities after January 1, 2007, and provides
 10  1 that such certificates, including certificates to refund
 10  2 outstanding certificates, may not be issued if the maturity
 10  3 date of the certificates would be after the date the rural
 10  4 improvement zone is to be dissolved, as provided by the bill.
 10  5    Current Code section 357H.9 authorizes rural improvement
 10  6 zones to authorize the use of taxes from a division of taxes
 10  7 (tax increment financing).  The bill provides that for fiscal
 10  8 years beginning on or after July 1, 2016, when calculating
 10  9 the amount of taxes subject to the division of taxes, if the
 10 10 assessed value of the taxable property in the rural improvement
 10 11 zone used to calculate the amount of taxes to be paid to the
 10 12 other taxing districts is less than 50 percent of the assessed
 10 13 value of the taxable property in the rural improvement zone
 10 14 used to calculate the total amount of property taxes in the
 10 15 rural improvement zone for the fiscal year in which the taxes
 10 16 are due and payable, the assessed value of the taxable property
 10 17 in the rural improvement zone used to calculate the amount of
 10 18 taxes to be paid to the other taxing districts (base value)
 10 19 shall be increased for that fiscal year to an amount equal to
 10 20 50 percent of the assessed value of the taxable property in the
 10 21 rural improvement zone used to calculate the total amount of
 10 22 property taxes in the rural improvement zone for the fiscal
 10 23 year in which the taxes are due and payable.
 10 24    The bill provides that for fiscal years beginning on or after
 10 25 July 1, 2016, when determining the assessed value of property
 10 26 within a rural improvement zone that is subject to a division
 10 27 of tax revenues, the requirement under Code section 403.20
 10 28 that the valuation reductions (rollback) first be subtracted
 10 29 from the assessed value of the property as determined pursuant
 10 30 to Code section 403.19(1) (base value), does not apply and

 10 33 in the rural improvement zone.

 11  7 zone to conduct the audit.
 11  8    The bill provides that, unless dissolved by resolution of
 11  9 the board of trustees, each rural improvement zone is dissolved
 11 10 on June 30, 2019, or 20 years from the first day of the fiscal
 11 11 year following the fiscal year in which the zone first receives
 11 12 revenue from the division of taxes, whichever is later.  The
 11 13 bill further provides that the date required for dissolution
 11 14 may be extended by resolution of the board of supervisors
 11 15 adopted prior to the date required for dissolution or prior to
 11 16 the date to which the rural improvement zone was previously
 11 17 extended by the board of supervisors under the provisions of
 11 18 the bill.  Each extension shall be for a period of 20 years.
 11 19    The bill updates language relating to the disposition of
 11 20 property upon dissolution of the zone and specifies that any
 11 21 collection of, or division of, property taxes under Code
 11 22 chapter 357H ceases immediately upon dissolution of the zone.

 12  4 The board of supervisors requests additional information from
 12  5 the board of trustees. As part of the board of supervisors'

  9 32 information.
  9 33    The bill strikes the provision which prohibited the issuance
  9 34 of certificates for the payment of a rural improvement zone's
  9 35 improvements and activities after January 1, 2007, and provides
 10  1 that such certificates, including certificates to refund
 10  2 outstanding certificates, may not be issued if the maturity
 10  3 date of the certificates would be after the date the rural
 10  4 improvement zone is to be dissolved, as provided by the bill.
 10  5    Current Code section 357H.9 authorizes rural improvement
 10  6 zones to authorize the use of taxes from a division of taxes
 10  7 (tax increment financing).  The bill provides that for fiscal
 10  8 years beginning on or after July 1, 2016, when calculating
 10  9 the amount of taxes subject to the division of taxes, if the
 10 10 assessed value of the taxable property in the rural improvement
 10 11 zone used to calculate the amount of taxes to be paid to the
 10 12 other taxing districts is less than 50 percent of the assessed
 10 13 value of the taxable property in the rural improvement zone
 10 14 used to calculate the total amount of property taxes in the
 10 15 rural improvement zone for the fiscal year in which the taxes
 10 16 are due and payable, the assessed value of the taxable property
 10 17 in the rural improvement zone used to calculate the amount of
 10 18 taxes to be paid to the other taxing districts (base value)
 10 19 shall be increased for that fiscal year to an amount equal to
 10 20 50 percent of the assessed value of the taxable property in the
 10 21 rural improvement zone used to calculate the total amount of
 10 22 property taxes in the rural improvement zone for the fiscal
 10 23 year in which the taxes are due and payable.
 10 24    The bill provides that for fiscal years beginning on or after
 10 25 July 1, 2016, when determining the assessed value of property
 10 26 within a rural improvement zone that is subject to a division
 10 27 of tax revenues, the requirement under Code section 403.20
 10 28 that the valuation reductions (rollback) first be subtracted
 10 29 from the assessed value of the property as determined pursuant
 10 30 to Code section 403.19(1) (base value), does not apply and
 10 31 provides that the rollbacks for that year shall instead be
 10 32 applied uniformly, by class of property, to all actual value
 10 33 in the rural improvement zone.
 10 34    The bill provides that not later than December 1 of each
 10 35 year the board of trustees of a zone shall file with the
 11  1 county auditor an annual financial report showing the rural
 11  2 improvement zone's financial condition as of June 30 and the
 11  3 results of operations for the year then ended.  The bill also
 11  4 provides that all rural improvement zones are subject to annual
 11  5 audit either by the auditor of state or by a certified public
 11  6 accountant contracted with or employed by the rural improvement
 11  7 zone to conduct the audit.
 11  8    The bill provides that, unless dissolved by resolution of
 11  9 the board of trustees, each rural improvement zone is dissolved
 11 10 on June 30, 2019, or 20 years from the first day of the fiscal
 11 11 year following the fiscal year in which the zone first receives
 11 12 revenue from the division of taxes, whichever is later.  The
 11 13 bill further provides that the date required for dissolution
 11 14 may be extended by resolution of the board of supervisors
 11 15 adopted prior to the date required for dissolution or prior to
 11 16 the date to which the rural improvement zone was previously
 11 17 extended by the board of supervisors under the provisions of
 11 18 the bill.  Each extension shall be for a period of 20 years.
 11 19    The bill updates language relating to the disposition of
 11 20 property upon dissolution of the zone and specifies that any
 11 21 collection of, or division of, property taxes under Code
 11 22 chapter 357H ceases immediately upon dissolution of the zone.
 11 23    Under the bill, the rural improvement zone's board of
 11 24 trustees must file a petition with the board of supervisors
 11 25 requesting an extension of the dissolution date. The petition
 11 26 must state the continued need for the rural improvement zone
 11 27 and describe the improvements needed in the zone beyond the
 11 28 dissolution date otherwise required by the bill. Within 90
 11 29 days after receiving the petition, the board of supervisors
 11 30 must either adopt a resolution granting the 20=year extension
 11 31 without further proceedings, or notify the board of trustees in
 11 32 writing of the board's intent to review the zone's dissolution
 11 33 date.  The board may, as part of its notice to the board of
 11 34 trustees, request a report prepared by a licensed professional
 11 35 engineer.  If the board fails to either approve the extension
 12  1 by resolution or notify the board of trustees of the board's
 12  2 intent to review the zone's dissolution date within the 90=day
 12  3 period, the request for a 20=year extension is deemed approved.
 12  4 The board of supervisors requests additional information from
 12  5 the board of trustees. As part of the board of supervisors'
 12  6 further review of the petition, a public hearing must be held
 12  7 within the period of time specified in the bill.  Within
 12  8 10 days after the public hearing, the board of supervisors
 12  9 is required to either find a continued need for the rural
 12 10 improvement zone and adopt a resolution approving the 20=year
 12 11 extension or find that the continued operation of the rural
 12 12 improvement zone is not necessary and deny the request for an
 12 13 extension.  If the board fails to either approve or deny the
 12 14 extension within the 10=day period, the request for a 20=year
 12 15 extension is deemed approved.
 12 16    The bill provides that any agreement or other instrument in
 12 17 connection with an agreement between a board of trustees and a
 12 18 board in existence on July 1, 2015, relating to the division
 12 19 of taxes, the dissolution date of a rural improvement zone, or
 12 20 the criteria used for determining the continued existence of
 12 21 a rural improvement zone that is inconsistent with this Code
 12 22 chapter shall be null and void.

  8 24 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  8 25 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  8 26    This bill relates to the establishment, operation, and
  8 27 dissolution of rural improvement zones under Code chapter 357H.
  8 28    Current law provides that the population threshold for
  8 29 establishing a rural improvement zone is determined using
  8 30 the 2000 certified federal census.  The bill changes that
  8 31 requirement so that the population is determined using the
  8 32 most recent certified federal census.  The bill also adds a
  8 33 definition of "lake" for purposes of determining eligibility to
  8 34 establish a rural improvement zone.  The bill defines "lake"
  8 35 to mean a body of water that has a surface area of at least 80
  9  1 acres.
  9  2    The bill adds water quality measures to the definition of
  9  3 "improvements".  Under Code chapter 357H, the board of trustees
  9  4 may authorize construction, reconstruction, or repair of
  9  5 improvements for the rural improvement zone.
  9  6    The bill provides that as part of the approval process for a
  9  7 rural improvement zone, the petition must include a statement
  9  8 of the need for the proposed zone based upon a report prepared
  9  9 by a licensed professional engineer.  The report utilized
  9 10 in preparing the petition must have been prepared not more
  9 11 than two years before the date the petition is filed. The
  9 12 information required to be included in the engineer's report
  9 13 relates to the size of the lake, soil classification, silt
  9 14 accumulation data and estimates, water quality assessments,
  9 15 and cost estimates. The bill requires a copy of the report
  9 16 prepared by the licensed professional engineer and used to
  9 17 prepare the petition to be submitted with the petition.
  9 18    The bill changes the period of time required for holding
  9 19 a public hearing on the petition from within 30 days
  9 20 of presentation of the petition to within 60 days.  In
  9 21 addition, the bill provides that if the board of supervisors
  9 22 determines that the petition or the engineer's report does
  9 23 not substantially meet the statutory requirements, the
  9 24 board may, within 30 days of presentation of the petition,
  9 25 request additional information from the petitioners. The
  9 26 board's request for additional information is limited to the
  9 27 statutorily required information that was not contained in the
  9 28 petition or in the accompanying engineer's report. The bill
  9 29 limits the board to one request for additional information.
  9 30 Upon presentation of the additional information, the public

 10 17 in the rural improvement zone used to calculate the amount of
 10 18 taxes to be paid to the other taxing districts (base value)
 10 19 shall be increased for that fiscal year to an amount equal to

 10 21 rural improvement zone used to calculate the total amount of
 10 22 property taxes in the rural improvement zone for the fiscal

  9 25 request additional information from the petitioners. The
  9 26 board's request for additional information is limited to the
  9 27 statutorily required information that was not contained in the
  9 28 petition or in the accompanying engineer's report. The bill
  9 29 limits the board to one request for additional information.
  9 30 Upon presentation of the additional information, the public
  9 31 hearing must be held within 60 days of receiving the additional
  9 32 information.
  9 33    The bill strikes the provision which prohibited the issuance
  9 34 of certificates for the payment of a rural improvement zone's
  9 35 improvements and activities after January 1, 2007, and provides
 10  1 that such certificates, including certificates to refund
 10  2 outstanding certificates, may not be issued if the maturity
 10  3 date of the certificates would be after the date the rural
 10  4 improvement zone is to be dissolved, as provided by the bill.
 10  5    Current Code section 357H.9 authorizes rural improvement
 10  6 zones to authorize the use of taxes from a division of taxes
 10  7 (tax increment financing).  The bill provides that for fiscal
 10  8 years beginning on or after July 1, 2016, when calculating
 10  9 the amount of taxes subject to the division of taxes, if the
 10 10 assessed value of the taxable property in the rural improvement
 10 11 zone used to calculate the amount of taxes to be paid to the
 10 12 other taxing districts is less than 50 percent of the assessed
 10 13 value of the taxable property in the rural improvement zone
 10 14 used to calculate the total amount of property taxes in the
 10 15 rural improvement zone for the fiscal year in which the taxes
 10 16 are due and payable, the assessed value of the taxable property
 10 17 in the rural improvement zone used to calculate the amount of
 10 18 taxes to be paid to the other taxing districts (base value)
 10 19 shall be increased for that fiscal year to an amount equal to
 10 20 50 percent of the assessed value of the taxable property in the
 10 21 rural improvement zone used to calculate the total amount of
 10 22 property taxes in the rural improvement zone for the fiscal
 10 23 year in which the taxes are due and payable.
 10 24    The bill provides that for fiscal years beginning on or after
 10 25 July 1, 2016, when determining the assessed value of property
 10 26 within a rural improvement zone that is subject to a division
 10 27 of tax revenues, the requirement under Code section 403.20
 10 28 that the valuation reductions (rollback) first be subtracted
 10 29 from the assessed value of the property as determined pursuant
 10 30 to Code section 403.19(1) (base value), does not apply and
 10 31 provides that the rollbacks for that year shall instead be
 10 32 applied uniformly, by class of property, to all actual value
 10 33 in the rural improvement zone.
 10 34    The bill provides that not later than December 1 of each
 10 35 year the board of trustees of a zone shall file with the
 11  1 county auditor an annual financial report showing the rural
 11  2 improvement zone's financial condition as of June 30 and the
 11  3 results of operations for the year then ended.  The bill also
 11  4 provides that all rural improvement zones are subject to annual
 11  5 audit either by the auditor of state or by a certified public
 11  6 accountant contracted with or employed by the rural improvement
 11  7 zone to conduct the audit.
 11  8    The bill provides that, unless dissolved by resolution of
 11  9 the board of trustees, each rural improvement zone is dissolved
 11 10 on June 30, 2019, or 20 years from the first day of the fiscal
 11 11 year following the fiscal year in which the zone first receives
 11 12 revenue from the division of taxes, whichever is later.  The
 11 13 bill further provides that the date required for dissolution
 11 14 may be extended by resolution of the board of supervisors
 11 15 adopted prior to the date required for dissolution or prior to
 11 16 the date to which the rural improvement zone was previously
 11 17 extended by the board of supervisors under the provisions of
 11 18 the bill.  Each extension shall be for a period of 20 years.
 11 19    The bill updates language relating to the disposition of
 11 20 property upon dissolution of the zone and specifies that any
 11 21 collection of, or division of, property taxes under Code
 11 22 chapter 357H ceases immediately upon dissolution of the zone.
 11 23    Under the bill, the rural improvement zone's board of
 11 24 trustees must file a petition with the board of supervisors
 11 25 requesting an extension of the dissolution date. The petition
 11 26 must state the continued need for the rural improvement zone
 11 27 and describe the improvements needed in the zone beyond the
 11 28 dissolution date otherwise required by the bill. Within 90
 11 29 days after receiving the petition, the board of supervisors
 11 30 must either adopt a resolution granting the 20=year extension
 11 31 without further proceedings, or notify the board of trustees in
 11 32 writing of the board's intent to review the zone's dissolution
 11 33 date.  The board may, as part of its notice to the board of
 11 34 trustees, request a report prepared by a licensed professional
 11 35 engineer.  If the board fails to either approve the extension
 12  1 by resolution or notify the board of trustees of the board's
 12  2 intent to review the zone's dissolution date within the 90=day
 12  3 period, the request for a 20=year extension is deemed approved.
 12  4 The board of supervisors requests additional information from
 12  5 the board of trustees. As part of the board of supervisors'
 12  6 further review of the petition, a public hearing must be held
 12  7 within the period of time specified in the bill.  Within
 12  8 10 days after the public hearing, the board of supervisors
 12  9 is required to either find a continued need for the rural
 12 10 improvement zone and adopt a resolution approving the 20=year
 12 11 extension or find that the continued operation of the rural
 12 12 improvement zone is not necessary and deny the request for an
 12 13 extension.  If the board fails to either approve or deny the
 12 14 extension within the 10=day period, the request for a 20=year
 12 15 extension is deemed approved.
 12 16    The bill provides that any agreement or other instrument in
 12 17 connection with an agreement between a board of trustees and a
 12 18 board in existence on July 1, 2015, relating to the division
 12 19 of taxes, the dissolution date of a rural improvement zone, or
 12 20 the criteria used for determining the continued existence of
 12 21 a rural improvement zone that is inconsistent with this Code
 12 22 chapter shall be null and void.

  8 27 dissolution of rural improvement zones under Code chapter 357H.
  8 28    Current law provides that the population threshold for
  8 29 establishing a rural improvement zone is determined using
  8 30 the 2000 certified federal census.  The bill changes that
  8 31 requirement so that the population is determined using the
  8 32 most recent certified federal census.  The bill also adds a
  8 33 definition of "lake" for purposes of determining eligibility to
  8 34 establish a rural improvement zone.  The bill defines "lake"
  8 35 to mean a body of water that has a surface area of at least 80
  9  1 acres.
  9  2    The bill adds water quality measures to the definition of
  9  3 "improvements".  Under Code chapter 357H, the board of trustees
  9  4 may authorize construction, reconstruction, or repair of
  9  5 improvements for the rural improvement zone.
  9  6    The bill provides that as part of the approval process for a
  9  7 rural improvement zone, the petition must include a statement
  9  8 of the need for the proposed zone based upon a report prepared
  9  9 by a licensed professional engineer.  The report utilized
  9 10 in preparing the petition must have been prepared not more
  9 11 than two years before the date the petition is filed. The
  9 12 information required to be included in the engineer's report
  9 13 relates to the size of the lake, soil classification, silt
  9 14 accumulation data and estimates, water quality assessments,
  9 15 and cost estimates. The bill requires a copy of the report
  9 16 prepared by the licensed professional engineer and used to
  9 17 prepare the petition to be submitted with the petition.
  9 18    The bill changes the period of time required for holding
  9 19 a public hearing on the petition from within 30 days
  9 20 of presentation of the petition to within 60 days.  In
  9 21 addition, the bill provides that if the board of supervisors
  9 22 determines that the petition or the engineer's report does
  9 23 not substantially meet the statutory requirements, the
  9 24 board may, within 30 days of presentation of the petition,
  9 25 request additional information from the petitioners. The

 11 10 on June 30, 2019, or 20 years from the first day of the fiscal
 11 11 year following the fiscal year in which the zone first receives

  9 28 petition or in the accompanying engineer's report. The bill
  9 29 limits the board to one request for additional information.
  9 30 Upon presentation of the additional information, the public
  9 31 hearing must be held within 60 days of receiving the additional
  9 32 information.
  9 33    The bill strikes the provision which prohibited the issuance
  9 34 of certificates for the payment of a rural improvement zone's
  9 35 improvements and activities after January 1, 2007, and provides
 10  1 that such certificates, including certificates to refund
 10  2 outstanding certificates, may not be issued if the maturity
 10  3 date of the certificates would be after the date the rural
 10  4 improvement zone is to be dissolved, as provided by the bill.
 10  5    Current Code section 357H.9 authorizes rural improvement
 10  6 zones to authorize the use of taxes from a division of taxes
 10  7 (tax increment financing).  The bill provides that for fiscal
 10  8 years beginning on or after July 1, 2016, when calculating
 10  9 the amount of taxes subject to the division of taxes, if the
 10 10 assessed value of the taxable property in the rural improvement
 10 11 zone used to calculate the amount of taxes to be paid to the
 10 12 other taxing districts is less than 50 percent of the assessed
 10 13 value of the taxable property in the rural improvement zone
 10 14 used to calculate the total amount of property taxes in the
 10 15 rural improvement zone for the fiscal year in which the taxes
 10 16 are due and payable, the assessed value of the taxable property
 10 17 in the rural improvement zone used to calculate the amount of
 10 18 taxes to be paid to the other taxing districts (base value)
 10 19 shall be increased for that fiscal year to an amount equal to
 10 20 50 percent of the assessed value of the taxable property in the
 10 21 rural improvement zone used to calculate the total amount of
 10 22 property taxes in the rural improvement zone for the fiscal
 10 23 year in which the taxes are due and payable.
 10 24    The bill provides that for fiscal years beginning on or after
 10 25 July 1, 2016, when determining the assessed value of property
 10 26 within a rural improvement zone that is subject to a division
 10 27 of tax revenues, the requirement under Code section 403.20
 10 28 that the valuation reductions (rollback) first be subtracted
 10 29 from the assessed value of the property as determined pursuant
 10 30 to Code section 403.19(1) (base value), does not apply and
 10 31 provides that the rollbacks for that year shall instead be
 10 32 applied uniformly, by class of property, to all actual value
 10 33 in the rural improvement zone.
 10 34    The bill provides that not later than December 1 of each
 10 35 year the board of trustees of a zone shall file with the
 11  1 county auditor an annual financial report showing the rural
 11  2 improvement zone's financial condition as of June 30 and the
 11  3 results of operations for the year then ended.  The bill also
 11  4 provides that all rural improvement zones are subject to annual
 11  5 audit either by the auditor of state or by a certified public
 11  6 accountant contracted with or employed by the rural improvement
 11  7 zone to conduct the audit.
 11  8    The bill provides that, unless dissolved by resolution of
 11  9 the board of trustees, each rural improvement zone is dissolved
 11 10 on June 30, 2019, or 20 years from the first day of the fiscal
 11 11 year following the fiscal year in which the zone first receives
 11 12 revenue from the division of taxes, whichever is later.  The
 11 13 bill further provides that the date required for dissolution
 11 14 may be extended by resolution of the board of supervisors
 11 15 adopted prior to the date required for dissolution or prior to
 11 16 the date to which the rural improvement zone was previously
 11 17 extended by the board of supervisors under the provisions of
 11 18 the bill.  Each extension shall be for a period of 20 years.
 11 19    The bill updates language relating to the disposition of
 11 20 property upon dissolution of the zone and specifies that any
 11 21 collection of, or division of, property taxes under Code
 11 22 chapter 357H ceases immediately upon dissolution of the zone.
 11 23    Under the bill, the rural improvement zone's board of
 11 24 trustees must file a petition with the board of supervisors
 11 25 requesting an extension of the dissolution date. The petition
 11 26 must state the continued need for the rural improvement zone
 11 27 and describe the improvements needed in the zone beyond the
 11 28 dissolution date otherwise required by the bill. Within 90
 11 29 days after receiving the petition, the board of supervisors
 11 30 must either adopt a resolution granting the 20=year extension
 11 31 without further proceedings, or notify the board of trustees in
 11 32 writing of the board's intent to review the zone's dissolution
 11 33 date.  The board may, as part of its notice to the board of
 11 34 trustees, request a report prepared by a licensed professional
 11 35 engineer.  If the board fails to either approve the extension
 12  1 by resolution or notify the board of trustees of the board's
 12  2 intent to review the zone's dissolution date within the 90=day
 12  3 period, the request for a 20=year extension is deemed approved.
 12  4 The board of supervisors requests additional information from
 12  5 the board of trustees. As part of the board of supervisors'
 12  6 further review of the petition, a public hearing must be held
 12  7 within the period of time specified in the bill.  Within
 12  8 10 days after the public hearing, the board of supervisors
 12  9 is required to either find a continued need for the rural
 12 10 improvement zone and adopt a resolution approving the 20=year
 12 11 extension or find that the continued operation of the rural
 12 12 improvement zone is not necessary and deny the request for an
 12 13 extension.  If the board fails to either approve or deny the
 12 14 extension within the 10=day period, the request for a 20=year
 12 15 extension is deemed approved.
 12 16    The bill provides that any agreement or other instrument in
 12 17 connection with an agreement between a board of trustees and a
 12 18 board in existence on July 1, 2015, relating to the division
 12 19 of taxes, the dissolution date of a rural improvement zone, or
 12 20 the criteria used for determining the continued existence of
 12 21 a rural improvement zone that is inconsistent with this Code
 12 22 chapter shall be null and void.

  8 31 requirement so that the population is determined using the
  8 32 most recent certified federal census.  The bill also adds a
  8 33 definition of "lake" for purposes of determining eligibility to
  8 34 establish a rural improvement zone.  The bill defines "lake"
  8 35 to mean a body of water that has a surface area of at least 80
  9  1 acres.
  9  2    The bill adds water quality measures to the definition of
  9  3 "improvements".  Under Code chapter 357H, the board of trustees
  9  4 may authorize construction, reconstruction, or repair of
  9  5 improvements for the rural improvement zone.
  9  6    The bill provides that as part of the approval process for a
  9  7 rural improvement zone, the petition must include a statement
  9  8 of the need for the proposed zone based upon a report prepared
  9  9 by a licensed professional engineer.  The report utilized
  9 10 in preparing the petition must have been prepared not more
  9 11 than two years before the date the petition is filed. The
  9 12 information required to be included in the engineer's report
  9 13 relates to the size of the lake, soil classification, silt
  9 14 accumulation data and estimates, water quality assessments,
  9 15 and cost estimates. The bill requires a copy of the report
  9 16 prepared by the licensed professional engineer and used to
  9 17 prepare the petition to be submitted with the petition.
  9 18    The bill changes the period of time required for holding
  9 19 a public hearing on the petition from within 30 days
  9 20 of presentation of the petition to within 60 days.  In
  9 21 addition, the bill provides that if the board of supervisors
  9 22 determines that the petition or the engineer's report does
  9 23 not substantially meet the statutory requirements, the
  9 24 board may, within 30 days of presentation of the petition,
  9 25 request additional information from the petitioners. The
  9 26 board's request for additional information is limited to the
  9 27 statutorily required information that was not contained in the
  9 28 petition or in the accompanying engineer's report. The bill
  9 29 limits the board to one request for additional information.

 10 14 used to calculate the total amount of property taxes in the

 10 16 are due and payable, the assessed value of the taxable property
 10 17 in the rural improvement zone used to calculate the amount of
 10 18 taxes to be paid to the other taxing districts (base value)
 10 19 shall be increased for that fiscal year to an amount equal to

 10 22 property taxes in the rural improvement zone for the fiscal
 10 23 year in which the taxes are due and payable.
 10 24    The bill provides that for fiscal years beginning on or after

 10 26 within a rural improvement zone that is subject to a division
 10 27 of tax revenues, the requirement under Code section 403.20

 11  5 audit either by the auditor of state or by a certified public
 11  6 accountant contracted with or employed by the rural improvement
 11  7 zone to conduct the audit.
 11  8    The bill provides that, unless dissolved by resolution of
 11  9 the board of trustees, each rural improvement zone is dissolved
 11 10 on June 30, 2019, or 20 years from the first day of the fiscal
 11 11 year following the fiscal year in which the zone first receives
 11 12 revenue from the division of taxes, whichever is later.  The
 11 13 bill further provides that the date required for dissolution
 11 14 may be extended by resolution of the board of supervisors
 11 15 adopted prior to the date required for dissolution or prior to
 11 16 the date to which the rural improvement zone was previously
 11 17 extended by the board of supervisors under the provisions of

 11 33 date.  The board may, as part of its notice to the board of
 11 34 trustees, request a report prepared by a licensed professional

 12  3 period, the request for a 20=year extension is deemed approved.
 12  4 The board of supervisors requests additional information from
 12  5 the board of trustees. As part of the board of supervisors'

 10  5    Current Code section 357H.9 authorizes rural improvement
 10  6 zones to authorize the use of taxes from a division of taxes
 10  7 (tax increment financing).  The bill provides that for fiscal
 10  8 years beginning on or after July 1, 2016, when calculating
 10  9 the amount of taxes subject to the division of taxes, if the
 10 10 assessed value of the taxable property in the rural improvement
 10 11 zone used to calculate the amount of taxes to be paid to the
 10 12 other taxing districts is less than 50 percent of the assessed
 10 13 value of the taxable property in the rural improvement zone
 10 14 used to calculate the total amount of property taxes in the
 10 15 rural improvement zone for the fiscal year in which the taxes
 10 16 are due and payable, the assessed value of the taxable property
 10 17 in the rural improvement zone used to calculate the amount of
 10 18 taxes to be paid to the other taxing districts (base value)
 10 19 shall be increased for that fiscal year to an amount equal to
 10 20 50 percent of the assessed value of the taxable property in the
 10 21 rural improvement zone used to calculate the total amount of
 10 22 property taxes in the rural improvement zone for the fiscal
 10 23 year in which the taxes are due and payable.
 10 24    The bill provides that for fiscal years beginning on or after
 10 25 July 1, 2016, when determining the assessed value of property
 10 26 within a rural improvement zone that is subject to a division
 10 27 of tax revenues, the requirement under Code section 403.20
 10 28 that the valuation reductions (rollback) first be subtracted
 10 29 from the assessed value of the property as determined pursuant
 10 30 to Code section 403.19(1) (base value), does not apply and
 10 31 provides that the rollbacks for that year shall instead be
 10 32 applied uniformly, by class of property, to all actual value
 10 33 in the rural improvement zone.
 10 34    The bill provides that not later than December 1 of each
 10 35 year the board of trustees of a zone shall file with the
 11  1 county auditor an annual financial report showing the rural
 11  2 improvement zone's financial condition as of June 30 and the
 11  3 results of operations for the year then ended.  The bill also
 11  4 provides that all rural improvement zones are subject to annual
 11  5 audit either by the auditor of state or by a certified public
 11  6 accountant contracted with or employed by the rural improvement
 11  7 zone to conduct the audit.
 11  8    The bill provides that, unless dissolved by resolution of
 11  9 the board of trustees, each rural improvement zone is dissolved
 11 10 on June 30, 2019, or 20 years from the first day of the fiscal
 11 11 year following the fiscal year in which the zone first receives
 11 12 revenue from the division of taxes, whichever is later.  The
 11 13 bill further provides that the date required for dissolution
 11 14 may be extended by resolution of the board of supervisors
 11 15 adopted prior to the date required for dissolution or prior to
 11 16 the date to which the rural improvement zone was previously
 11 17 extended by the board of supervisors under the provisions of
 11 18 the bill.  Each extension shall be for a period of 20 years.
 11 19    The bill updates language relating to the disposition of
 11 20 property upon dissolution of the zone and specifies that any
 11 21 collection of, or division of, property taxes under Code
 11 22 chapter 357H ceases immediately upon dissolution of the zone.
 11 23    Under the bill, the rural improvement zone's board of
 11 24 trustees must file a petition with the board of supervisors
 11 25 requesting an extension of the dissolution date. The petition
 11 26 must state the continued need for the rural improvement zone
 11 27 and describe the improvements needed in the zone beyond the
 11 28 dissolution date otherwise required by the bill. Within 90
 11 29 days after receiving the petition, the board of supervisors
 11 30 must either adopt a resolution granting the 20=year extension
 11 31 without further proceedings, or notify the board of trustees in
 11 32 writing of the board's intent to review the zone's dissolution
 11 33 date.  The board may, as part of its notice to the board of
 11 34 trustees, request a report prepared by a licensed professional
 11 35 engineer.  If the board fails to either approve the extension
 12  1 by resolution or notify the board of trustees of the board's
 12  2 intent to review the zone's dissolution date within the 90=day
 12  3 period, the request for a 20=year extension is deemed approved.
 12  4 The board of supervisors requests additional information from
 12  5 the board of trustees. As part of the board of supervisors'
 12  6 further review of the petition, a public hearing must be held
 12  7 within the period of time specified in the bill.  Within
 12  8 10 days after the public hearing, the board of supervisors
 12  9 is required to either find a continued need for the rural
 12 10 improvement zone and adopt a resolution approving the 20=year
 12 11 extension or find that the continued operation of the rural
 12 12 improvement zone is not necessary and deny the request for an
 12 13 extension.  If the board fails to either approve or deny the
 12 14 extension within the 10=day period, the request for a 20=year
 12 15 extension is deemed approved.
 12 16    The bill provides that any agreement or other instrument in
 12 17 connection with an agreement between a board of trustees and a
 12 18 board in existence on July 1, 2015, relating to the division
 12 19 of taxes, the dissolution date of a rural improvement zone, or
 12 20 the criteria used for determining the continued existence of
 12 21 a rural improvement zone that is inconsistent with this Code
 12 22 chapter shall be null and void.

  9  6    The bill provides that as part of the approval process for a
  9  7 rural improvement zone, the petition must include a statement
  9  8 of the need for the proposed zone based upon a report prepared
  9  9 by a licensed professional engineer.  The report utilized
  9 10 in preparing the petition must have been prepared not more
  9 11 than two years before the date the petition is filed. The

  9 13 relates to the size of the lake, soil classification, silt
  9 14 accumulation data and estimates, water quality assessments,
  9 15 and cost estimates. The bill requires a copy of the report
  9 16 prepared by the licensed professional engineer and used to
  9 17 prepare the petition to be submitted with the petition.
  9 18    The bill changes the period of time required for holding
  9 19 a public hearing on the petition from within 30 days
  9 20 of presentation of the petition to within 60 days.  In
  9 21 addition, the bill provides that if the board of supervisors
  9 22 determines that the petition or the engineer's report does
  9 23 not substantially meet the statutory requirements, the
  9 24 board may, within 30 days of presentation of the petition,
  9 25 request additional information from the petitioners. The
  9 26 board's request for additional information is limited to the
  9 27 statutorily required information that was not contained in the

  9 31 hearing must be held within 60 days of receiving the additional
  9 32 information.
  9 33    The bill strikes the provision which prohibited the issuance
  9 34 of certificates for the payment of a rural improvement zone's
  9 35 improvements and activities after January 1, 2007, and provides
 10  1 that such certificates, including certificates to refund
 10  2 outstanding certificates, may not be issued if the maturity
 10  3 date of the certificates would be after the date the rural
 10  4 improvement zone is to be dissolved, as provided by the bill.

 10 25 July 1, 2016, when determining the assessed value of property
 10 26 within a rural improvement zone that is subject to a division
 10 27 of tax revenues, the requirement under Code section 403.20
 10 28 that the valuation reductions (rollback) first be subtracted
 10 29 from the assessed value of the property as determined pursuant
 10 30 to Code section 403.19(1) (base value), does not apply and
 10 31 provides that the rollbacks for that year shall instead be
 10 32 applied uniformly, by class of property, to all actual value
 10 33 in the rural improvement zone.
 10 34    The bill provides that not later than December 1 of each
 10 35 year the board of trustees of a zone shall file with the
 11  1 county auditor an annual financial report showing the rural
 11  2 improvement zone's financial condition as of June 30 and the
 11  3 results of operations for the year then ended.  The bill also
 11  4 provides that all rural improvement zones are subject to annual
 11  5 audit either by the auditor of state or by a certified public
 11  6 accountant contracted with or employed by the rural improvement
 11  7 zone to conduct the audit.
 11  8    The bill provides that, unless dissolved by resolution of
 11  9 the board of trustees, each rural improvement zone is dissolved
 11 10 on June 30, 2019, or 20 years from the first day of the fiscal
 11 11 year following the fiscal year in which the zone first receives
 11 12 revenue from the division of taxes, whichever is later.  The
 11 13 bill further provides that the date required for dissolution
 11 14 may be extended by resolution of the board of supervisors
 11 15 adopted prior to the date required for dissolution or prior to
 11 16 the date to which the rural improvement zone was previously
 11 17 extended by the board of supervisors under the provisions of
 11 18 the bill.  Each extension shall be for a period of 20 years.
 11 19    The bill updates language relating to the disposition of
 11 20 property upon dissolution of the zone and specifies that any
 11 21 collection of, or division of, property taxes under Code
 11 22 chapter 357H ceases immediately upon dissolution of the zone.
 11 23    Under the bill, the rural improvement zone's board of
 11 24 trustees must file a petition with the board of supervisors
 11 25 requesting an extension of the dissolution date. The petition
 11 26 must state the continued need for the rural improvement zone
 11 27 and describe the improvements needed in the zone beyond the
 11 28 dissolution date otherwise required by the bill. Within 90
 11 29 days after receiving the petition, the board of supervisors
 11 30 must either adopt a resolution granting the 20=year extension
 11 31 without further proceedings, or notify the board of trustees in
 11 32 writing of the board's intent to review the zone's dissolution
 11 33 date.  The board may, as part of its notice to the board of
 11 34 trustees, request a report prepared by a licensed professional
 11 35 engineer.  If the board fails to either approve the extension
 12  1 by resolution or notify the board of trustees of the board's
 12  2 intent to review the zone's dissolution date within the 90=day
 12  3 period, the request for a 20=year extension is deemed approved.
 12  4 The board of supervisors requests additional information from
 12  5 the board of trustees. As part of the board of supervisors'
 12  6 further review of the petition, a public hearing must be held
 12  7 within the period of time specified in the bill.  Within
 12  8 10 days after the public hearing, the board of supervisors
 12  9 is required to either find a continued need for the rural
 12 10 improvement zone and adopt a resolution approving the 20=year
 12 11 extension or find that the continued operation of the rural
 12 12 improvement zone is not necessary and deny the request for an
 12 13 extension.  If the board fails to either approve or deny the
 12 14 extension within the 10=day period, the request for a 20=year
 12 15 extension is deemed approved.
 12 16    The bill provides that any agreement or other instrument in
 12 17 connection with an agreement between a board of trustees and a
 12 18 board in existence on July 1, 2015, relating to the division
 12 19 of taxes, the dissolution date of a rural improvement zone, or
 12 20 the criteria used for determining the continued existence of
 12 21 a rural improvement zone that is inconsistent with this Code
 12 22 chapter shall be null and void.

  9  2    The bill adds water quality measures to the definition of
  9  3 "improvements".  Under Code chapter 357H, the board of trustees
  9  4 may authorize construction, reconstruction, or repair of
  9  5 improvements for the rural improvement zone.
  9  6    The bill provides that as part of the approval process for a
  9  7 rural improvement zone, the petition must include a statement
  9  8 of the need for the proposed zone based upon a report prepared
  9  9 by a licensed professional engineer.  The report utilized
  9 10 in preparing the petition must have been prepared not more
  9 11 than two years before the date the petition is filed. The
  9 12 information required to be included in the engineer's report
  9 13 relates to the size of the lake, soil classification, silt
  9 14 accumulation data and estimates, water quality assessments,
  9 15 and cost estimates. The bill requires a copy of the report
  9 16 prepared by the licensed professional engineer and used to
  9 17 prepare the petition to be submitted with the petition.
  9 18    The bill changes the period of time required for holding
  9 19 a public hearing on the petition from within 30 days
  9 20 of presentation of the petition to within 60 days.  In
  9 21 addition, the bill provides that if the board of supervisors
  9 22 determines that the petition or the engineer's report does
  9 23 not substantially meet the statutory requirements, the
  9 24 board may, within 30 days of presentation of the petition,
  9 25 request additional information from the petitioners. The
  9 26 board's request for additional information is limited to the
  9 27 statutorily required information that was not contained in the
  9 28 petition or in the accompanying engineer's report. The bill
  9 29 limits the board to one request for additional information.
  9 30 Upon presentation of the additional information, the public
  9 31 hearing must be held within 60 days of receiving the additional
  9 32 information.
  9 33    The bill strikes the provision which prohibited the issuance
  9 34 of certificates for the payment of a rural improvement zone's
  9 35 improvements and activities after January 1, 2007, and provides
 10  1 that such certificates, including certificates to refund
 10  2 outstanding certificates, may not be issued if the maturity
 10  3 date of the certificates would be after the date the rural
 10  4 improvement zone is to be dissolved, as provided by the bill.
 10  5    Current Code section 357H.9 authorizes rural improvement
 10  6 zones to authorize the use of taxes from a division of taxes
 10  7 (tax increment financing).  The bill provides that for fiscal
 10  8 years beginning on or after July 1, 2016, when calculating
 10  9 the amount of taxes subject to the division of taxes, if the
 10 10 assessed value of the taxable property in the rural improvement
 10 11 zone used to calculate the amount of taxes to be paid to the
 10 12 other taxing districts is less than 50 percent of the assessed
 10 13 value of the taxable property in the rural improvement zone
 10 14 used to calculate the total amount of property taxes in the
 10 15 rural improvement zone for the fiscal year in which the taxes
 10 16 are due and payable, the assessed value of the taxable property
 10 17 in the rural improvement zone used to calculate the amount of
 10 18 taxes to be paid to the other taxing districts (base value)
 10 19 shall be increased for that fiscal year to an amount equal to
 10 20 50 percent of the assessed value of the taxable property in the
 10 21 rural improvement zone used to calculate the total amount of
 10 22 property taxes in the rural improvement zone for the fiscal
 10 23 year in which the taxes are due and payable.

 11  7 zone to conduct the audit.
 11  8    The bill provides that, unless dissolved by resolution of
 11  9 the board of trustees, each rural improvement zone is dissolved
 11 10 on June 30, 2019, or 20 years from the first day of the fiscal
 11 11 year following the fiscal year in which the zone first receives
 11 12 revenue from the division of taxes, whichever is later.  The
 11 13 bill further provides that the date required for dissolution
 11 14 may be extended by resolution of the board of supervisors
 11 15 adopted prior to the date required for dissolution or prior to
 11 16 the date to which the rural improvement zone was previously
 11 17 extended by the board of supervisors under the provisions of

 12  1 by resolution or notify the board of trustees of the board's
 12  2 intent to review the zone's dissolution date within the 90=day
 12  3 period, the request for a 20=year extension is deemed approved.
 12  4 The board of supervisors requests additional information from
 12  5 the board of trustees. As part of the board of supervisors'
 12  6 further review of the petition, a public hearing must be held
 12  7 within the period of time specified in the bill.  Within
 12  8 10 days after the public hearing, the board of supervisors
 12  9 is required to either find a continued need for the rural
 12 10 improvement zone and adopt a resolution approving the 20=year

 11 19    The bill updates language relating to the disposition of
 11 20 property upon dissolution of the zone and specifies that any
 11 21 collection of, or division of, property taxes under Code
 11 22 chapter 357H ceases immediately upon dissolution of the zone.
 11 23    Under the bill, the rural improvement zone's board of
 11 24 trustees must file a petition with the board of supervisors
 11 25 requesting an extension of the dissolution date. The petition
 11 26 must state the continued need for the rural improvement zone
 11 27 and describe the improvements needed in the zone beyond the
 11 28 dissolution date otherwise required by the bill. Within 90
 11 29 days after receiving the petition, the board of supervisors
 11 30 must either adopt a resolution granting the 20=year extension
 11 31 without further proceedings, or notify the board of trustees in
 11 32 writing of the board's intent to review the zone's dissolution
 11 33 date.  The board may, as part of its notice to the board of
 11 34 trustees, request a report prepared by a licensed professional
 11 35 engineer.  If the board fails to either approve the extension
 12  1 by resolution or notify the board of trustees of the board's
 12  2 intent to review the zone's dissolution date within the 90=day
 12  3 period, the request for a 20=year extension is deemed approved.
 12  4 The board of supervisors requests additional information from
 12  5 the board of trustees. As part of the board of supervisors'
 12  6 further review of the petition, a public hearing must be held
 12  7 within the period of time specified in the bill.  Within
 12  8 10 days after the public hearing, the board of supervisors
 12  9 is required to either find a continued need for the rural
 12 10 improvement zone and adopt a resolution approving the 20=year
 12 11 extension or find that the continued operation of the rural
 12 12 improvement zone is not necessary and deny the request for an
 12 13 extension.  If the board fails to either approve or deny the
 12 14 extension within the 10=day period, the request for a 20=year
 12 15 extension is deemed approved.
 12 16    The bill provides that any agreement or other instrument in
 12 17 connection with an agreement between a board of trustees and a
 12 18 board in existence on July 1, 2015, relating to the division
 12 19 of taxes, the dissolution date of a rural improvement zone, or
 12 20 the criteria used for determining the continued existence of
 12 21 a rural improvement zone that is inconsistent with this Code
 12 22 chapter shall be null and void.

  9  5 improvements for the rural improvement zone.
  9  6    The bill provides that as part of the approval process for a
  9  7 rural improvement zone, the petition must include a statement
  9  8 of the need for the proposed zone based upon a report prepared
  9  9 by a licensed professional engineer.  The report utilized
  9 10 in preparing the petition must have been prepared not more
  9 11 than two years before the date the petition is filed. The
  9 12 information required to be included in the engineer's report
  9 13 relates to the size of the lake, soil classification, silt
  9 14 accumulation data and estimates, water quality assessments,
  9 15 and cost estimates. The bill requires a copy of the report
  9 16 prepared by the licensed professional engineer and used to
  9 17 prepare the petition to be submitted with the petition.
  9 18    The bill changes the period of time required for holding
  9 19 a public hearing on the petition from within 30 days
  9 20 of presentation of the petition to within 60 days.  In
  9 21 addition, the bill provides that if the board of supervisors
  9 22 determines that the petition or the engineer's report does
  9 23 not substantially meet the statutory requirements, the
  9 24 board may, within 30 days of presentation of the petition,
  9 25 request additional information from the petitioners. The
  9 26 board's request for additional information is limited to the
  9 27 statutorily required information that was not contained in the
  9 28 petition or in the accompanying engineer's report. The bill
  9 29 limits the board to one request for additional information.
  9 30 Upon presentation of the additional information, the public
  9 31 hearing must be held within 60 days of receiving the additional
  9 32 information.
  9 33    The bill strikes the provision which prohibited the issuance
  9 34 of certificates for the payment of a rural improvement zone's
  9 35 improvements and activities after January 1, 2007, and provides
 10  1 that such certificates, including certificates to refund
 10  2 outstanding certificates, may not be issued if the maturity
 10  3 date of the certificates would be after the date the rural
 10  4 improvement zone is to be dissolved, as provided by the bill.
 10  5    Current Code section 357H.9 authorizes rural improvement
 10  6 zones to authorize the use of taxes from a division of taxes
 10  7 (tax increment financing).  The bill provides that for fiscal
 10  8 years beginning on or after July 1, 2016, when calculating
 10  9 the amount of taxes subject to the division of taxes, if the
 10 10 assessed value of the taxable property in the rural improvement
 10 11 zone used to calculate the amount of taxes to be paid to the
 10 12 other taxing districts is less than 50 percent of the assessed
 10 13 value of the taxable property in the rural improvement zone
 10 14 used to calculate the total amount of property taxes in the
 10 15 rural improvement zone for the fiscal year in which the taxes
 10 16 are due and payable, the assessed value of the taxable property
 10 17 in the rural improvement zone used to calculate the amount of
 10 18 taxes to be paid to the other taxing districts (base value)
 10 19 shall be increased for that fiscal year to an amount equal to
 10 20 50 percent of the assessed value of the taxable property in the
 10 21 rural improvement zone used to calculate the total amount of
 10 22 property taxes in the rural improvement zone for the fiscal
 10 23 year in which the taxes are due and payable.
 10 24    The bill provides that for fiscal years beginning on or after
 10 25 July 1, 2016, when determining the assessed value of property
 10 26 within a rural improvement zone that is subject to a division
 10 27 of tax revenues, the requirement under Code section 403.20
 10 28 that the valuation reductions (rollback) first be subtracted
 10 29 from the assessed value of the property as determined pursuant
 10 30 to Code section 403.19(1) (base value), does not apply and
 10 31 provides that the rollbacks for that year shall instead be
 10 32 applied uniformly, by class of property, to all actual value
 10 33 in the rural improvement zone.
 10 34    The bill provides that not later than December 1 of each
 10 35 year the board of trustees of a zone shall file with the
 11  1 county auditor an annual financial report showing the rural
 11  2 improvement zone's financial condition as of June 30 and the
 11  3 results of operations for the year then ended.  The bill also
 11  4 provides that all rural improvement zones are subject to annual
 11  5 audit either by the auditor of state or by a certified public
 11  6 accountant contracted with or employed by the rural improvement
 11  7 zone to conduct the audit.
 11  8    The bill provides that, unless dissolved by resolution of
 11  9 the board of trustees, each rural improvement zone is dissolved
 11 10 on June 30, 2019, or 20 years from the first day of the fiscal
 11 11 year following the fiscal year in which the zone first receives
 11 12 revenue from the division of taxes, whichever is later.  The
 11 13 bill further provides that the date required for dissolution
 11 14 may be extended by resolution of the board of supervisors
 11 15 adopted prior to the date required for dissolution or prior to
 11 16 the date to which the rural improvement zone was previously
 11 17 extended by the board of supervisors under the provisions of
 11 18 the bill.  Each extension shall be for a period of 20 years.
 11 19    The bill updates language relating to the disposition of
 11 20 property upon dissolution of the zone and specifies that any
 11 21 collection of, or division of, property taxes under Code
 11 22 chapter 357H ceases immediately upon dissolution of the zone.
 11 23    Under the bill, the rural improvement zone's board of
 11 24 trustees must file a petition with the board of supervisors
 11 25 requesting an extension of the dissolution date. The petition
 11 26 must state the continued need for the rural improvement zone
 11 27 and describe the improvements needed in the zone beyond the
 11 28 dissolution date otherwise required by the bill. Within 90
 11 29 days after receiving the petition, the board of supervisors
 11 30 must either adopt a resolution granting the 20=year extension
 11 31 without further proceedings, or notify the board of trustees in
 11 32 writing of the board's intent to review the zone's dissolution
 11 33 date.  The board may, as part of its notice to the board of
 11 34 trustees, request a report prepared by a licensed professional
 11 35 engineer.  If the board fails to either approve the extension
 12  1 by resolution or notify the board of trustees of the board's
 12  2 intent to review the zone's dissolution date within the 90=day
 12  3 period, the request for a 20=year extension is deemed approved.
 12  4 The board of supervisors requests additional information from
 12  5 the board of trustees. As part of the board of supervisors'
 12  6 further review of the petition, a public hearing must be held
 12  7 within the period of time specified in the bill.  Within
 12  8 10 days after the public hearing, the board of supervisors
 12  9 is required to either find a continued need for the rural
 12 10 improvement zone and adopt a resolution approving the 20=year
 12 11 extension or find that the continued operation of the rural
 12 12 improvement zone is not necessary and deny the request for an
 12 13 extension.  If the board fails to either approve or deny the
 12 14 extension within the 10=day period, the request for a 20=year

  9  7 rural improvement zone, the petition must include a statement
  9  8 of the need for the proposed zone based upon a report prepared
  9  9 by a licensed professional engineer.  The report utilized
  9 10 in preparing the petition must have been prepared not more
  9 11 than two years before the date the petition is filed. The
  9 12 information required to be included in the engineer's report
  9 13 relates to the size of the lake, soil classification, silt
  9 14 accumulation data and estimates, water quality assessments,
  9 15 and cost estimates. The bill requires a copy of the report
  9 16 prepared by the licensed professional engineer and used to
  9 17 prepare the petition to be submitted with the petition.
  9 18    The bill changes the period of time required for holding
  9 19 a public hearing on the petition from within 30 days
  9 20 of presentation of the petition to within 60 days.  In
  9 21 addition, the bill provides that if the board of supervisors
  9 22 determines that the petition or the engineer's report does
  9 23 not substantially meet the statutory requirements, the
  9 24 board may, within 30 days of presentation of the petition,
  9 25 request additional information from the petitioners. The
  9 26 board's request for additional information is limited to the
  9 27 statutorily required information that was not contained in the
  9 28 petition or in the accompanying engineer's report. The bill
  9 29 limits the board to one request for additional information.
  9 30 Upon presentation of the additional information, the public
  9 31 hearing must be held within 60 days of receiving the additional
  9 32 information.
  9 33    The bill strikes the provision which prohibited the issuance
  9 34 of certificates for the payment of a rural improvement zone's
  9 35 improvements and activities after January 1, 2007, and provides
 10  1 that such certificates, including certificates to refund
 10  2 outstanding certificates, may not be issued if the maturity
 10  3 date of the certificates would be after the date the rural
 10  4 improvement zone is to be dissolved, as provided by the bill.
 10  5    Current Code section 357H.9 authorizes rural improvement
 10  6 zones to authorize the use of taxes from a division of taxes
 10  7 (tax increment financing).  The bill provides that for fiscal
 10  8 years beginning on or after July 1, 2016, when calculating
 10  9 the amount of taxes subject to the division of taxes, if the
 10 10 assessed value of the taxable property in the rural improvement
 10 11 zone used to calculate the amount of taxes to be paid to the
 10 12 other taxing districts is less than 50 percent of the assessed
 10 13 value of the taxable property in the rural improvement zone
 10 14 used to calculate the total amount of property taxes in the
 10 15 rural improvement zone for the fiscal year in which the taxes
 10 16 are due and payable, the assessed value of the taxable property
 10 17 in the rural improvement zone used to calculate the amount of
 10 18 taxes to be paid to the other taxing districts (base value)
 10 19 shall be increased for that fiscal year to an amount equal to
 10 20 50 percent of the assessed value of the taxable property in the
 10 21 rural improvement zone used to calculate the total amount of
 10 22 property taxes in the rural improvement zone for the fiscal
 10 23 year in which the taxes are due and payable.
 10 24    The bill provides that for fiscal years beginning on or after
 10 25 July 1, 2016, when determining the assessed value of property
 10 26 within a rural improvement zone that is subject to a division
 10 27 of tax revenues, the requirement under Code section 403.20
 10 28 that the valuation reductions (rollback) first be subtracted
 10 29 from the assessed value of the property as determined pursuant
 10 30 to Code section 403.19(1) (base value), does not apply and
 10 31 provides that the rollbacks for that year shall instead be
 10 32 applied uniformly, by class of property, to all actual value
 10 33 in the rural improvement zone.
 10 34    The bill provides that not later than December 1 of each
 10 35 year the board of trustees of a zone shall file with the
 11  1 county auditor an annual financial report showing the rural
 11  2 improvement zone's financial condition as of June 30 and the
 11  3 results of operations for the year then ended.  The bill also
 11  4 provides that all rural improvement zones are subject to annual
 11  5 audit either by the auditor of state or by a certified public
 11  6 accountant contracted with or employed by the rural improvement
 11  7 zone to conduct the audit.
 11  8    The bill provides that, unless dissolved by resolution of
 11  9 the board of trustees, each rural improvement zone is dissolved
 11 10 on June 30, 2019, or 20 years from the first day of the fiscal
 11 11 year following the fiscal year in which the zone first receives
 11 12 revenue from the division of taxes, whichever is later.  The
 11 13 bill further provides that the date required for dissolution
 11 14 may be extended by resolution of the board of supervisors
 11 15 adopted prior to the date required for dissolution or prior to
 11 16 the date to which the rural improvement zone was previously
 11 17 extended by the board of supervisors under the provisions of
 11 18 the bill.  Each extension shall be for a period of 20 years.
 11 19    The bill updates language relating to the disposition of
 11 20 property upon dissolution of the zone and specifies that any
 11 21 collection of, or division of, property taxes under Code
 11 22 chapter 357H ceases immediately upon dissolution of the zone.
 11 23    Under the bill, the rural improvement zone's board of
 11 24 trustees must file a petition with the board of supervisors
 11 25 requesting an extension of the dissolution date. The petition
 11 26 must state the continued need for the rural improvement zone
 11 27 and describe the improvements needed in the zone beyond the
 11 28 dissolution date otherwise required by the bill. Within 90
 11 29 days after receiving the petition, the board of supervisors
 11 30 must either adopt a resolution granting the 20=year extension
 11 31 without further proceedings, or notify the board of trustees in
 11 32 writing of the board's intent to review the zone's dissolution
 11 33 date.  The board may, as part of its notice to the board of
 11 34 trustees, request a report prepared by a licensed professional
 11 35 engineer.  If the board fails to either approve the extension
 12  1 by resolution or notify the board of trustees of the board's
 12  2 intent to review the zone's dissolution date within the 90=day
 12  3 period, the request for a 20=year extension is deemed approved.
 12  4 The board of supervisors requests additional information from
 12  5 the board of trustees. As part of the board of supervisors'
 12  6 further review of the petition, a public hearing must be held
 12  7 within the period of time specified in the bill.  Within
 12  8 10 days after the public hearing, the board of supervisors
 12  9 is required to either find a continued need for the rural
 12 10 improvement zone and adopt a resolution approving the 20=year
 12 11 extension or find that the continued operation of the rural
 12 12 improvement zone is not necessary and deny the request for an
 12 13 extension.  If the board fails to either approve or deny the
 12 14 extension within the 10=day period, the request for a 20=year
 12 15 extension is deemed approved.
 12 16    The bill provides that any agreement or other instrument in
 12 17 connection with an agreement between a board of trustees and a
 12 18 board in existence on July 1, 2015, relating to the division
 12 19 of taxes, the dissolution date of a rural improvement zone, or
 12 20 the criteria used for determining the continued existence of
 12 21 a rural improvement zone that is inconsistent with this Code

 11  1 county auditor an annual financial report showing the rural
 11  2 improvement zone's financial condition as of June 30 and the

 11  6 accountant contracted with or employed by the rural improvement
 11  7 zone to conduct the audit.
 11  8    The bill provides that, unless dissolved by resolution of

 10 21 rural improvement zone used to calculate the total amount of
 10 22 property taxes in the rural improvement zone for the fiscal
 10 23 year in which the taxes are due and payable.
 10 24    The bill provides that for fiscal years beginning on or after
 10 25 July 1, 2016, when determining the assessed value of property
 10 26 within a rural improvement zone that is subject to a division
 10 27 of tax revenues, the requirement under Code section 403.20
 10 28 that the valuation reductions (rollback) first be subtracted
 10 29 from the assessed value of the property as determined pursuant
 10 30 to Code section 403.19(1) (base value), does not apply and
 10 31 provides that the rollbacks for that year shall instead be
 10 32 applied uniformly, by class of property, to all actual value
 10 33 in the rural improvement zone.
 10 34    The bill provides that not later than December 1 of each
 10 35 year the board of trustees of a zone shall file with the
 11  1 county auditor an annual financial report showing the rural
 11  2 improvement zone's financial condition as of June 30 and the
 11  3 results of operations for the year then ended.  The bill also
 11  4 provides that all rural improvement zones are subject to annual
 11  5 audit either by the auditor of state or by a certified public
 11  6 accountant contracted with or employed by the rural improvement
 11  7 zone to conduct the audit.
 11  8    The bill provides that, unless dissolved by resolution of
 11  9 the board of trustees, each rural improvement zone is dissolved
 11 10 on June 30, 2019, or 20 years from the first day of the fiscal
 11 11 year following the fiscal year in which the zone first receives
 11 12 revenue from the division of taxes, whichever is later.  The
 11 13 bill further provides that the date required for dissolution
 11 14 may be extended by resolution of the board of supervisors
 11 15 adopted prior to the date required for dissolution or prior to
 11 16 the date to which the rural improvement zone was previously
 11 17 extended by the board of supervisors under the provisions of
 11 18 the bill.  Each extension shall be for a period of 20 years.
 11 19    The bill updates language relating to the disposition of
 11 20 property upon dissolution of the zone and specifies that any
 11 21 collection of, or division of, property taxes under Code
 11 22 chapter 357H ceases immediately upon dissolution of the zone.
 11 23    Under the bill, the rural improvement zone's board of
 11 24 trustees must file a petition with the board of supervisors
 11 25 requesting an extension of the dissolution date. The petition
 11 26 must state the continued need for the rural improvement zone
 11 27 and describe the improvements needed in the zone beyond the
 11 28 dissolution date otherwise required by the bill. Within 90
 11 29 days after receiving the petition, the board of supervisors
 11 30 must either adopt a resolution granting the 20=year extension
 11 31 without further proceedings, or notify the board of trustees in
 11 32 writing of the board's intent to review the zone's dissolution
 11 33 date.  The board may, as part of its notice to the board of
 11 34 trustees, request a report prepared by a licensed professional
 11 35 engineer.  If the board fails to either approve the extension
 12  1 by resolution or notify the board of trustees of the board's
 12  2 intent to review the zone's dissolution date within the 90=day
 12  3 period, the request for a 20=year extension is deemed approved.
 12  4 The board of supervisors requests additional information from
 12  5 the board of trustees. As part of the board of supervisors'
 12  6 further review of the petition, a public hearing must be held
 12  7 within the period of time specified in the bill.  Within
 12  8 10 days after the public hearing, the board of supervisors
 12  9 is required to either find a continued need for the rural
 12 10 improvement zone and adopt a resolution approving the 20=year
 12 11 extension or find that the continued operation of the rural
 12 12 improvement zone is not necessary and deny the request for an
 12 13 extension.  If the board fails to either approve or deny the
 12 14 extension within the 10=day period, the request for a 20=year
 12 15 extension is deemed approved.
 12 16    The bill provides that any agreement or other instrument in
 12 17 connection with an agreement between a board of trustees and a
 12 18 board in existence on July 1, 2015, relating to the division
 12 19 of taxes, the dissolution date of a rural improvement zone, or
 12 20 the criteria used for determining the continued existence of
 12 21 a rural improvement zone that is inconsistent with this Code
 12 22 chapter shall be null and void.

  9 13 relates to the size of the lake, soil classification, silt
  9 14 accumulation data and estimates, water quality assessments,
  9 15 and cost estimates. The bill requires a copy of the report
  9 16 prepared by the licensed professional engineer and used to
  9 17 prepare the petition to be submitted with the petition.
  9 18    The bill changes the period of time required for holding
  9 19 a public hearing on the petition from within 30 days
  9 20 of presentation of the petition to within 60 days.  In
  9 21 addition, the bill provides that if the board of supervisors
  9 22 determines that the petition or the engineer's report does
  9 23 not substantially meet the statutory requirements, the
  9 24 board may, within 30 days of presentation of the petition,
  9 25 request additional information from the petitioners. The
  9 26 board's request for additional information is limited to the
  9 27 statutorily required information that was not contained in the
  9 28 petition or in the accompanying engineer's report. The bill
  9 29 limits the board to one request for additional information.
  9 30 Upon presentation of the additional information, the public
  9 31 hearing must be held within 60 days of receiving the additional
  9 32 information.
  9 33    The bill strikes the provision which prohibited the issuance
  9 34 of certificates for the payment of a rural improvement zone's
  9 35 improvements and activities after January 1, 2007, and provides
 10  1 that such certificates, including certificates to refund
 10  2 outstanding certificates, may not be issued if the maturity
 10  3 date of the certificates would be after the date the rural
 10  4 improvement zone is to be dissolved, as provided by the bill.
 10  5    Current Code section 357H.9 authorizes rural improvement
 10  6 zones to authorize the use of taxes from a division of taxes
 10  7 (tax increment financing).  The bill provides that for fiscal
 10  8 years beginning on or after July 1, 2016, when calculating
 10  9 the amount of taxes subject to the division of taxes, if the
 10 10 assessed value of the taxable property in the rural improvement
 10 11 zone used to calculate the amount of taxes to be paid to the
 10 12 other taxing districts is less than 50 percent of the assessed
 10 13 value of the taxable property in the rural improvement zone
 10 14 used to calculate the total amount of property taxes in the
 10 15 rural improvement zone for the fiscal year in which the taxes
 10 16 are due and payable, the assessed value of the taxable property
 10 17 in the rural improvement zone used to calculate the amount of
 10 18 taxes to be paid to the other taxing districts (base value)
 10 19 shall be increased for that fiscal year to an amount equal to
 10 20 50 percent of the assessed value of the taxable property in the
 10 21 rural improvement zone used to calculate the total amount of
 10 22 property taxes in the rural improvement zone for the fiscal
 10 23 year in which the taxes are due and payable.
 10 24    The bill provides that for fiscal years beginning on or after
 10 25 July 1, 2016, when determining the assessed value of property
 10 26 within a rural improvement zone that is subject to a division
 10 27 of tax revenues, the requirement under Code section 403.20
 10 28 that the valuation reductions (rollback) first be subtracted
 10 29 from the assessed value of the property as determined pursuant
 10 30 to Code section 403.19(1) (base value), does not apply and
 10 31 provides that the rollbacks for that year shall instead be
 10 32 applied uniformly, by class of property, to all actual value
 10 33 in the rural improvement zone.
 10 34    The bill provides that not later than December 1 of each
 10 35 year the board of trustees of a zone shall file with the
 11  1 county auditor an annual financial report showing the rural
 11  2 improvement zone's financial condition as of June 30 and the
 11  3 results of operations for the year then ended.  The bill also
 11  4 provides that all rural improvement zones are subject to annual
 11  5 audit either by the auditor of state or by a certified public
 11  6 accountant contracted with or employed by the rural improvement
 11  7 zone to conduct the audit.
 11  8    The bill provides that, unless dissolved by resolution of
 11  9 the board of trustees, each rural improvement zone is dissolved
 11 10 on June 30, 2019, or 20 years from the first day of the fiscal
 11 11 year following the fiscal year in which the zone first receives
 11 12 revenue from the division of taxes, whichever is later.  The
 11 13 bill further provides that the date required for dissolution
 11 14 may be extended by resolution of the board of supervisors
 11 15 adopted prior to the date required for dissolution or prior to
 11 16 the date to which the rural improvement zone was previously
 11 17 extended by the board of supervisors under the provisions of
 11 18 the bill.  Each extension shall be for a period of 20 years.
 11 19    The bill updates language relating to the disposition of
 11 20 property upon dissolution of the zone and specifies that any
 11 21 collection of, or division of, property taxes under Code
 11 22 chapter 357H ceases immediately upon dissolution of the zone.
 11 23    Under the bill, the rural improvement zone's board of
 11 24 trustees must file a petition with the board of supervisors
 11 25 requesting an extension of the dissolution date. The petition
 11 26 must state the continued need for the rural improvement zone
 11 27 and describe the improvements needed in the zone beyond the
 11 28 dissolution date otherwise required by the bill. Within 90
 11 29 days after receiving the petition, the board of supervisors
 11 30 must either adopt a resolution granting the 20=year extension
 11 31 without further proceedings, or notify the board of trustees in
 11 32 writing of the board's intent to review the zone's dissolution
 11 33 date.  The board may, as part of its notice to the board of
 11 34 trustees, request a report prepared by a licensed professional
 11 35 engineer.  If the board fails to either approve the extension
 12  1 by resolution or notify the board of trustees of the board's
 12  2 intent to review the zone's dissolution date within the 90=day
 12  3 period, the request for a 20=year extension is deemed approved.
 12  4 The board of supervisors requests additional information from
 12  5 the board of trustees. As part of the board of supervisors'
 12  6 further review of the petition, a public hearing must be held
 12  7 within the period of time specified in the bill.  Within
 12  8 10 days after the public hearing, the board of supervisors
 12  9 is required to either find a continued need for the rural
 12 10 improvement zone and adopt a resolution approving the 20=year
 12 11 extension or find that the continued operation of the rural
 12 12 improvement zone is not necessary and deny the request for an
 12 13 extension.  If the board fails to either approve or deny the
 12 14 extension within the 10=day period, the request for a 20=year
 12 15 extension is deemed approved.
 12 16    The bill provides that any agreement or other instrument in
 12 17 connection with an agreement between a board of trustees and a
 12 18 board in existence on July 1, 2015, relating to the division
 12 19 of taxes, the dissolution date of a rural improvement zone, or

 12 19 of taxes, the dissolution date of a rural improvement zone, or

  9 16 prepared by the licensed professional engineer and used to
  9 17 prepare the petition to be submitted with the petition.
  9 18    The bill changes the period of time required for holding
  9 19 a public hearing on the petition from within 30 days
  9 20 of presentation of the petition to within 60 days.  In
  9 21 addition, the bill provides that if the board of supervisors
  9 22 determines that the petition or the engineer's report does
  9 23 not substantially meet the statutory requirements, the
  9 24 board may, within 30 days of presentation of the petition,
  9 25 request additional information from the petitioners. The
  9 26 board's request for additional information is limited to the
  9 27 statutorily required information that was not contained in the
  9 28 petition or in the accompanying engineer's report. The bill
  9 29 limits the board to one request for additional information.
  9 30 Upon presentation of the additional information, the public
  9 31 hearing must be held within 60 days of receiving the additional
  9 32 information.
  9 33    The bill strikes the provision which prohibited the issuance
  9 34 of certificates for the payment of a rural improvement zone's
  9 35 improvements and activities after January 1, 2007, and provides
 10  1 that such certificates, including certificates to refund
 10  2 outstanding certificates, may not be issued if the maturity
 10  3 date of the certificates would be after the date the rural
 10  4 improvement zone is to be dissolved, as provided by the bill.
 10  5    Current Code section 357H.9 authorizes rural improvement
 10  6 zones to authorize the use of taxes from a division of taxes
 10  7 (tax increment financing).  The bill provides that for fiscal
 10  8 years beginning on or after July 1, 2016, when calculating
 10  9 the amount of taxes subject to the division of taxes, if the
 10 10 assessed value of the taxable property in the rural improvement
 10 11 zone used to calculate the amount of taxes to be paid to the
 10 12 other taxing districts is less than 50 percent of the assessed
 10 13 value of the taxable property in the rural improvement zone
 10 14 used to calculate the total amount of property taxes in the
 10 15 rural improvement zone for the fiscal year in which the taxes
 10 16 are due and payable, the assessed value of the taxable property
 10 17 in the rural improvement zone used to calculate the amount of
 10 18 taxes to be paid to the other taxing districts (base value)
 10 19 shall be increased for that fiscal year to an amount equal to
 10 20 50 percent of the assessed value of the taxable property in the
 10 21 rural improvement zone used to calculate the total amount of
 10 22 property taxes in the rural improvement zone for the fiscal
 10 23 year in which the taxes are due and payable.
 10 24    The bill provides that for fiscal years beginning on or after
 10 25 July 1, 2016, when determining the assessed value of property
 10 26 within a rural improvement zone that is subject to a division
 10 27 of tax revenues, the requirement under Code section 403.20
 10 28 that the valuation reductions (rollback) first be subtracted
 10 29 from the assessed value of the property as determined pursuant
 10 30 to Code section 403.19(1) (base value), does not apply and
 10 31 provides that the rollbacks for that year shall instead be
 10 32 applied uniformly, by class of property, to all actual value
 10 33 in the rural improvement zone.
 10 34    The bill provides that not later than December 1 of each
 10 35 year the board of trustees of a zone shall file with the
 11  1 county auditor an annual financial report showing the rural
 11  2 improvement zone's financial condition as of June 30 and the
 11  3 results of operations for the year then ended.  The bill also
 11  4 provides that all rural improvement zones are subject to annual
 11  5 audit either by the auditor of state or by a certified public
 11  6 accountant contracted with or employed by the rural improvement
 11  7 zone to conduct the audit.
 11  8    The bill provides that, unless dissolved by resolution of
 11  9 the board of trustees, each rural improvement zone is dissolved
 11 10 on June 30, 2019, or 20 years from the first day of the fiscal
 11 11 year following the fiscal year in which the zone first receives
 11 12 revenue from the division of taxes, whichever is later.  The
 11 13 bill further provides that the date required for dissolution
 11 14 may be extended by resolution of the board of supervisors
 11 15 adopted prior to the date required for dissolution or prior to
 11 16 the date to which the rural improvement zone was previously
 11 17 extended by the board of supervisors under the provisions of
 11 18 the bill.  Each extension shall be for a period of 20 years.
 11 19    The bill updates language relating to the disposition of
 11 20 property upon dissolution of the zone and specifies that any
 11 21 collection of, or division of, property taxes under Code
 11 22 chapter 357H ceases immediately upon dissolution of the zone.
 11 23    Under the bill, the rural improvement zone's board of
 11 24 trustees must file a petition with the board of supervisors
 11 25 requesting an extension of the dissolution date. The petition
 11 26 must state the continued need for the rural improvement zone
 11 27 and describe the improvements needed in the zone beyond the
 11 28 dissolution date otherwise required by the bill. Within 90
 11 29 days after receiving the petition, the board of supervisors
 11 30 must either adopt a resolution granting the 20=year extension
 11 31 without further proceedings, or notify the board of trustees in
 11 32 writing of the board's intent to review the zone's dissolution
 11 33 date.  The board may, as part of its notice to the board of
 11 34 trustees, request a report prepared by a licensed professional
 11 35 engineer.  If the board fails to either approve the extension
 12  1 by resolution or notify the board of trustees of the board's
 12  2 intent to review the zone's dissolution date within the 90=day
 12  3 period, the request for a 20=year extension is deemed approved.
 12  4 The board of supervisors requests additional information from
 12  5 the board of trustees. As part of the board of supervisors'
 12  6 further review of the petition, a public hearing must be held
 12  7 within the period of time specified in the bill.  Within
 12  8 10 days after the public hearing, the board of supervisors
 12  9 is required to either find a continued need for the rural
 12 10 improvement zone and adopt a resolution approving the 20=year

 11 11 year following the fiscal year in which the zone first receives
 11 12 revenue from the division of taxes, whichever is later.  The
 11 13 bill further provides that the date required for dissolution
 11 14 may be extended by resolution of the board of supervisors
 11 15 adopted prior to the date required for dissolution or prior to
 11 16 the date to which the rural improvement zone was previously
 11 17 extended by the board of supervisors under the provisions of

 11 23    Under the bill, the rural improvement zone's board of
 11 24 trustees must file a petition with the board of supervisors
 11 25 requesting an extension of the dissolution date. The petition
 11 26 must state the continued need for the rural improvement zone
 11 27 and describe the improvements needed in the zone beyond the
 11 28 dissolution date otherwise required by the bill. Within 90
 11 29 days after receiving the petition, the board of supervisors
 11 30 must either adopt a resolution granting the 20=year extension
 11 31 without further proceedings, or notify the board of trustees in
 11 32 writing of the board's intent to review the zone's dissolution
 11 33 date.  The board may, as part of its notice to the board of
 11 34 trustees, request a report prepared by a licensed professional
 11 35 engineer.  If the board fails to either approve the extension
 12  1 by resolution or notify the board of trustees of the board's
 12  2 intent to review the zone's dissolution date within the 90=day
 12  3 period, the request for a 20=year extension is deemed approved.
 12  4 The board of supervisors requests additional information from
 12  5 the board of trustees. As part of the board of supervisors'
 12  6 further review of the petition, a public hearing must be held
 12  7 within the period of time specified in the bill.  Within
 12  8 10 days after the public hearing, the board of supervisors
 12  9 is required to either find a continued need for the rural
 12 10 improvement zone and adopt a resolution approving the 20=year
 12 11 extension or find that the continued operation of the rural
 12 12 improvement zone is not necessary and deny the request for an
 12 13 extension.  If the board fails to either approve or deny the
 12 14 extension within the 10=day period, the request for a 20=year
 12 15 extension is deemed approved.
 12 16    The bill provides that any agreement or other instrument in
 12 17 connection with an agreement between a board of trustees and a
 12 18 board in existence on July 1, 2015, relating to the division
 12 19 of taxes, the dissolution date of a rural improvement zone, or
 12 20 the criteria used for determining the continued existence of

 10  6 zones to authorize the use of taxes from a division of taxes
 10  7 (tax increment financing).  The bill provides that for fiscal
 10  8 years beginning on or after July 1, 2016, when calculating

 10 26 within a rural improvement zone that is subject to a division
 10 27 of tax revenues, the requirement under Code section 403.20
 10 28 that the valuation reductions (rollback) first be subtracted
 10 29 from the assessed value of the property as determined pursuant

 10 33 in the rural improvement zone.
 10 34    The bill provides that not later than December 1 of each

 10  5    Current Code section 357H.9 authorizes rural improvement
 10  6 zones to authorize the use of taxes from a division of taxes
 10  7 (tax increment financing).  The bill provides that for fiscal
 10  8 years beginning on or after July 1, 2016, when calculating
 10  9 the amount of taxes subject to the division of taxes, if the
 10 10 assessed value of the taxable property in the rural improvement
 10 11 zone used to calculate the amount of taxes to be paid to the
 10 12 other taxing districts is less than 50 percent of the assessed
 10 13 value of the taxable property in the rural improvement zone
 10 14 used to calculate the total amount of property taxes in the
 10 15 rural improvement zone for the fiscal year in which the taxes
 10 16 are due and payable, the assessed value of the taxable property
 10 17 in the rural improvement zone used to calculate the amount of
 10 18 taxes to be paid to the other taxing districts (base value)
 10 19 shall be increased for that fiscal year to an amount equal to
 10 20 50 percent of the assessed value of the taxable property in the
 10 21 rural improvement zone used to calculate the total amount of
 10 22 property taxes in the rural improvement zone for the fiscal
 10 23 year in which the taxes are due and payable.
 10 24    The bill provides that for fiscal years beginning on or after
 10 25 July 1, 2016, when determining the assessed value of property
 10 26 within a rural improvement zone that is subject to a division
 10 27 of tax revenues, the requirement under Code section 403.20
 10 28 that the valuation reductions (rollback) first be subtracted
 10 29 from the assessed value of the property as determined pursuant
 10 30 to Code section 403.19(1) (base value), does not apply and
 10 31 provides that the rollbacks for that year shall instead be
 10 32 applied uniformly, by class of property, to all actual value
 10 33 in the rural improvement zone.
 10 34    The bill provides that not later than December 1 of each
 10 35 year the board of trustees of a zone shall file with the
 11  1 county auditor an annual financial report showing the rural
 11  2 improvement zone's financial condition as of June 30 and the
 11  3 results of operations for the year then ended.  The bill also
 11  4 provides that all rural improvement zones are subject to annual
 11  5 audit either by the auditor of state or by a certified public
 11  6 accountant contracted with or employed by the rural improvement
 11  7 zone to conduct the audit.
 11  8    The bill provides that, unless dissolved by resolution of
 11  9 the board of trustees, each rural improvement zone is dissolved
 11 10 on June 30, 2019, or 20 years from the first day of the fiscal
 11 11 year following the fiscal year in which the zone first receives
 11 12 revenue from the division of taxes, whichever is later.  The
 11 13 bill further provides that the date required for dissolution
 11 14 may be extended by resolution of the board of supervisors
 11 15 adopted prior to the date required for dissolution or prior to
 11 16 the date to which the rural improvement zone was previously
 11 17 extended by the board of supervisors under the provisions of
 11 18 the bill.  Each extension shall be for a period of 20 years.
 11 19    The bill updates language relating to the disposition of
 11 20 property upon dissolution of the zone and specifies that any
 11 21 collection of, or division of, property taxes under Code
 11 22 chapter 357H ceases immediately upon dissolution of the zone.
 11 23    Under the bill, the rural improvement zone's board of
 11 24 trustees must file a petition with the board of supervisors
 11 25 requesting an extension of the dissolution date. The petition
 11 26 must state the continued need for the rural improvement zone
 11 27 and describe the improvements needed in the zone beyond the
 11 28 dissolution date otherwise required by the bill. Within 90
 11 29 days after receiving the petition, the board of supervisors
 11 30 must either adopt a resolution granting the 20=year extension
 11 31 without further proceedings, or notify the board of trustees in
 11 32 writing of the board's intent to review the zone's dissolution
 11 33 date.  The board may, as part of its notice to the board of
 11 34 trustees, request a report prepared by a licensed professional
 11 35 engineer.  If the board fails to either approve the extension
 12  1 by resolution or notify the board of trustees of the board's
 12  2 intent to review the zone's dissolution date within the 90=day
 12  3 period, the request for a 20=year extension is deemed approved.
 12  4 The board of supervisors requests additional information from
 12  5 the board of trustees. As part of the board of supervisors'
 12  6 further review of the petition, a public hearing must be held
 12  7 within the period of time specified in the bill.  Within
 12  8 10 days after the public hearing, the board of supervisors
 12  9 is required to either find a continued need for the rural
 12 10 improvement zone and adopt a resolution approving the 20=year
 12 11 extension or find that the continued operation of the rural
 12 12 improvement zone is not necessary and deny the request for an
 12 13 extension.  If the board fails to either approve or deny the
 12 14 extension within the 10=day period, the request for a 20=year
 12 15 extension is deemed approved.
 12 16    The bill provides that any agreement or other instrument in
 12 17 connection with an agreement between a board of trustees and a
 12 18 board in existence on July 1, 2015, relating to the division
 12 19 of taxes, the dissolution date of a rural improvement zone, or
 12 20 the criteria used for determining the continued existence of
 12 21 a rural improvement zone that is inconsistent with this Code
 12 22 chapter shall be null and void.

  9 26 board's request for additional information is limited to the
  9 27 statutorily required information that was not contained in the
  9 28 petition or in the accompanying engineer's report. The bill
  9 29 limits the board to one request for additional information.
  9 30 Upon presentation of the additional information, the public
  9 31 hearing must be held within 60 days of receiving the additional
  9 32 information.
  9 33    The bill strikes the provision which prohibited the issuance
  9 34 of certificates for the payment of a rural improvement zone's
  9 35 improvements and activities after January 1, 2007, and provides
 10  1 that such certificates, including certificates to refund
 10  2 outstanding certificates, may not be issued if the maturity
 10  3 date of the certificates would be after the date the rural
 10  4 improvement zone is to be dissolved, as provided by the bill.
 10  5    Current Code section 357H.9 authorizes rural improvement
 10  6 zones to authorize the use of taxes from a division of taxes
 10  7 (tax increment financing).  The bill provides that for fiscal
 10  8 years beginning on or after July 1, 2016, when calculating
 10  9 the amount of taxes subject to the division of taxes, if the
 10 10 assessed value of the taxable property in the rural improvement
 10 11 zone used to calculate the amount of taxes to be paid to the
 10 12 other taxing districts is less than 50 percent of the assessed
 10 13 value of the taxable property in the rural improvement zone
 10 14 used to calculate the total amount of property taxes in the
 10 15 rural improvement zone for the fiscal year in which the taxes
 10 16 are due and payable, the assessed value of the taxable property
 10 17 in the rural improvement zone used to calculate the amount of
 10 18 taxes to be paid to the other taxing districts (base value)
 10 19 shall be increased for that fiscal year to an amount equal to
 10 20 50 percent of the assessed value of the taxable property in the
 10 21 rural improvement zone used to calculate the total amount of
 10 22 property taxes in the rural improvement zone for the fiscal
 10 23 year in which the taxes are due and payable.
 10 24    The bill provides that for fiscal years beginning on or after
 10 25 July 1, 2016, when determining the assessed value of property
 10 26 within a rural improvement zone that is subject to a division
 10 27 of tax revenues, the requirement under Code section 403.20
 10 28 that the valuation reductions (rollback) first be subtracted
 10 29 from the assessed value of the property as determined pursuant
 10 30 to Code section 403.19(1) (base value), does not apply and
 10 31 provides that the rollbacks for that year shall instead be
 10 32 applied uniformly, by class of property, to all actual value
 10 33 in the rural improvement zone.
 10 34    The bill provides that not later than December 1 of each
 10 35 year the board of trustees of a zone shall file with the
 11  1 county auditor an annual financial report showing the rural
 11  2 improvement zone's financial condition as of June 30 and the
 11  3 results of operations for the year then ended.  The bill also
 11  4 provides that all rural improvement zones are subject to annual
 11  5 audit either by the auditor of state or by a certified public
 11  6 accountant contracted with or employed by the rural improvement
 11  7 zone to conduct the audit.
 11  8    The bill provides that, unless dissolved by resolution of
 11  9 the board of trustees, each rural improvement zone is dissolved
 11 10 on June 30, 2019, or 20 years from the first day of the fiscal
 11 11 year following the fiscal year in which the zone first receives
 11 12 revenue from the division of taxes, whichever is later.  The
 11 13 bill further provides that the date required for dissolution
 11 14 may be extended by resolution of the board of supervisors
 11 15 adopted prior to the date required for dissolution or prior to
 11 16 the date to which the rural improvement zone was previously
 11 17 extended by the board of supervisors under the provisions of
 11 18 the bill.  Each extension shall be for a period of 20 years.
 11 19    The bill updates language relating to the disposition of
 11 20 property upon dissolution of the zone and specifies that any
 11 21 collection of, or division of, property taxes under Code
 11 22 chapter 357H ceases immediately upon dissolution of the zone.
 11 23    Under the bill, the rural improvement zone's board of
 11 24 trustees must file a petition with the board of supervisors
 11 25 requesting an extension of the dissolution date. The petition
 11 26 must state the continued need for the rural improvement zone
 11 27 and describe the improvements needed in the zone beyond the
 11 28 dissolution date otherwise required by the bill. Within 90
 11 29 days after receiving the petition, the board of supervisors
 11 30 must either adopt a resolution granting the 20=year extension
 11 31 without further proceedings, or notify the board of trustees in
 11 32 writing of the board's intent to review the zone's dissolution
 11 33 date.  The board may, as part of its notice to the board of
 11 34 trustees, request a report prepared by a licensed professional
 11 35 engineer.  If the board fails to either approve the extension
 12  1 by resolution or notify the board of trustees of the board's
 12  2 intent to review the zone's dissolution date within the 90=day
 12  3 period, the request for a 20=year extension is deemed approved.
 12  4 The board of supervisors requests additional information from
 12  5 the board of trustees. As part of the board of supervisors'
 12  6 further review of the petition, a public hearing must be held
 12  7 within the period of time specified in the bill.  Within
 12  8 10 days after the public hearing, the board of supervisors
 12  9 is required to either find a continued need for the rural
 12 10 improvement zone and adopt a resolution approving the 20=year
 12 11 extension or find that the continued operation of the rural
 12 12 improvement zone is not necessary and deny the request for an
 12 13 extension.  If the board fails to either approve or deny the
 12 14 extension within the 10=day period, the request for a 20=year
 12 15 extension is deemed approved.
 12 16    The bill provides that any agreement or other instrument in
 12 17 connection with an agreement between a board of trustees and a
 12 18 board in existence on July 1, 2015, relating to the division
 12 19 of taxes, the dissolution date of a rural improvement zone, or
 12 20 the criteria used for determining the continued existence of
 12 21 a rural improvement zone that is inconsistent with this Code
 12 22 chapter shall be null and void.

  9 33    The bill strikes the provision which prohibited the issuance
  9 34 of certificates for the payment of a rural improvement zone's
  9 35 improvements and activities after January 1, 2007, and provides
 10  1 that such certificates, including certificates to refund
 10  2 outstanding certificates, may not be issued if the maturity
 10  3 date of the certificates would be after the date the rural
 10  4 improvement zone is to be dissolved, as provided by the bill.
 10  5    Current Code section 357H.9 authorizes rural improvement
 10  6 zones to authorize the use of taxes from a division of taxes
 10  7 (tax increment financing).  The bill provides that for fiscal
 10  8 years beginning on or after July 1, 2016, when calculating
 10  9 the amount of taxes subject to the division of taxes, if the
 10 10 assessed value of the taxable property in the rural improvement
 10 11 zone used to calculate the amount of taxes to be paid to the
 10 12 other taxing districts is less than 50 percent of the assessed
 10 13 value of the taxable property in the rural improvement zone
 10 14 used to calculate the total amount of property taxes in the
 10 15 rural improvement zone for the fiscal year in which the taxes
 10 16 are due and payable, the assessed value of the taxable property
 10 17 in the rural improvement zone used to calculate the amount of
 10 18 taxes to be paid to the other taxing districts (base value)
 10 19 shall be increased for that fiscal year to an amount equal to
 10 20 50 percent of the assessed value of the taxable property in the
 10 21 rural improvement zone used to calculate the total amount of
 10 22 property taxes in the rural improvement zone for the fiscal
 10 23 year in which the taxes are due and payable.
 10 24    The bill provides that for fiscal years beginning on or after
 10 25 July 1, 2016, when determining the assessed value of property
 10 26 within a rural improvement zone that is subject to a division
 10 27 of tax revenues, the requirement under Code section 403.20
 10 28 that the valuation reductions (rollback) first be subtracted
 10 29 from the assessed value of the property as determined pursuant
 10 30 to Code section 403.19(1) (base value), does not apply and
 10 31 provides that the rollbacks for that year shall instead be
 10 32 applied uniformly, by class of property, to all actual value
 10 33 in the rural improvement zone.
 10 34    The bill provides that not later than December 1 of each
 10 35 year the board of trustees of a zone shall file with the
 11  1 county auditor an annual financial report showing the rural
 11  2 improvement zone's financial condition as of June 30 and the
 11  3 results of operations for the year then ended.  The bill also
 11  4 provides that all rural improvement zones are subject to annual
 11  5 audit either by the auditor of state or by a certified public
 11  6 accountant contracted with or employed by the rural improvement
 11  7 zone to conduct the audit.
 11  8    The bill provides that, unless dissolved by resolution of
 11  9 the board of trustees, each rural improvement zone is dissolved
 11 10 on June 30, 2019, or 20 years from the first day of the fiscal
 11 11 year following the fiscal year in which the zone first receives
 11 12 revenue from the division of taxes, whichever is later.  The
 11 13 bill further provides that the date required for dissolution
 11 14 may be extended by resolution of the board of supervisors
 11 15 adopted prior to the date required for dissolution or prior to
 11 16 the date to which the rural improvement zone was previously
 11 17 extended by the board of supervisors under the provisions of
 11 18 the bill.  Each extension shall be for a period of 20 years.
 11 19    The bill updates language relating to the disposition of
 11 20 property upon dissolution of the zone and specifies that any
 11 21 collection of, or division of, property taxes under Code
 11 22 chapter 357H ceases immediately upon dissolution of the zone.
 11 23    Under the bill, the rural improvement zone's board of
 11 24 trustees must file a petition with the board of supervisors
 11 25 requesting an extension of the dissolution date. The petition
 11 26 must state the continued need for the rural improvement zone
 11 27 and describe the improvements needed in the zone beyond the
 11 28 dissolution date otherwise required by the bill. Within 90
 11 29 days after receiving the petition, the board of supervisors
 11 30 must either adopt a resolution granting the 20=year extension
 11 31 without further proceedings, or notify the board of trustees in
 11 32 writing of the board's intent to review the zone's dissolution
 11 33 date.  The board may, as part of its notice to the board of
 11 34 trustees, request a report prepared by a licensed professional
 11 35 engineer.  If the board fails to either approve the extension
 12  1 by resolution or notify the board of trustees of the board's
 12  2 intent to review the zone's dissolution date within the 90=day
 12  3 period, the request for a 20=year extension is deemed approved.
 12  4 The board of supervisors requests additional information from
 12  5 the board of trustees. As part of the board of supervisors'
 12  6 further review of the petition, a public hearing must be held
 12  7 within the period of time specified in the bill.  Within
 12  8 10 days after the public hearing, the board of supervisors
 12  9 is required to either find a continued need for the rural
 12 10 improvement zone and adopt a resolution approving the 20=year
 12 11 extension or find that the continued operation of the rural
 12 12 improvement zone is not necessary and deny the request for an
 12 13 extension.  If the board fails to either approve or deny the
 12 14 extension within the 10=day period, the request for a 20=year

 12 17 connection with an agreement between a board of trustees and a
 12 18 board in existence on July 1, 2015, relating to the division

 10  8 years beginning on or after July 1, 2016, when calculating
 10  9 the amount of taxes subject to the division of taxes, if the
 10 10 assessed value of the taxable property in the rural improvement
 10 11 zone used to calculate the amount of taxes to be paid to the
 10 12 other taxing districts is less than 50 percent of the assessed
 10 13 value of the taxable property in the rural improvement zone
 10 14 used to calculate the total amount of property taxes in the
 10 15 rural improvement zone for the fiscal year in which the taxes
 10 16 are due and payable, the assessed value of the taxable property
 10 17 in the rural improvement zone used to calculate the amount of
 10 18 taxes to be paid to the other taxing districts (base value)
 10 19 shall be increased for that fiscal year to an amount equal to
 10 20 50 percent of the assessed value of the taxable property in the

 10 26 within a rural improvement zone that is subject to a division
 10 27 of tax revenues, the requirement under Code section 403.20
 10 28 that the valuation reductions (rollback) first be subtracted
 10 29 from the assessed value of the property as determined pursuant
 10 30 to Code section 403.19(1) (base value), does not apply and
 10 31 provides that the rollbacks for that year shall instead be
 10 32 applied uniformly, by class of property, to all actual value
 10 33 in the rural improvement zone.
 10 34    The bill provides that not later than December 1 of each
 10 35 year the board of trustees of a zone shall file with the

 11  6 accountant contracted with or employed by the rural improvement
 11  7 zone to conduct the audit.
 11  8    The bill provides that, unless dissolved by resolution of
 11  9 the board of trustees, each rural improvement zone is dissolved

 11 11 year following the fiscal year in which the zone first receives
 11 12 revenue from the division of taxes, whichever is later.  The

 11 14 may be extended by resolution of the board of supervisors
 11 15 adopted prior to the date required for dissolution or prior to
 11 16 the date to which the rural improvement zone was previously
 11 17 extended by the board of supervisors under the provisions of

 11 20 property upon dissolution of the zone and specifies that any
 11 21 collection of, or division of, property taxes under Code

 11 26 must state the continued need for the rural improvement zone
 11 27 and describe the improvements needed in the zone beyond the

 11 29 days after receiving the petition, the board of supervisors
 11 30 must either adopt a resolution granting the 20=year extension
 11 31 without further proceedings, or notify the board of trustees in
 11 32 writing of the board's intent to review the zone's dissolution

 12  5 the board of trustees. As part of the board of supervisors'
 12  6 further review of the petition, a public hearing must be held

 12  8 10 days after the public hearing, the board of supervisors
 12  9 is required to either find a continued need for the rural

 10 23 year in which the taxes are due and payable.
 10 24    The bill provides that for fiscal years beginning on or after
 10 25 July 1, 2016, when determining the assessed value of property
 10 26 within a rural improvement zone that is subject to a division
 10 27 of tax revenues, the requirement under Code section 403.20
 10 28 that the valuation reductions (rollback) first be subtracted
 10 29 from the assessed value of the property as determined pursuant
 10 30 to Code section 403.19(1) (base value), does not apply and
 10 31 provides that the rollbacks for that year shall instead be
 10 32 applied uniformly, by class of property, to all actual value
 10 33 in the rural improvement zone.
 10 34    The bill provides that not later than December 1 of each
 10 35 year the board of trustees of a zone shall file with the

 11  5 audit either by the auditor of state or by a certified public
 11  6 accountant contracted with or employed by the rural improvement
 11  7 zone to conduct the audit.
 11  8    The bill provides that, unless dissolved by resolution of

 11 11 year following the fiscal year in which the zone first receives
 11 12 revenue from the division of taxes, whichever is later.  The
 11 13 bill further provides that the date required for dissolution
 11 14 may be extended by resolution of the board of supervisors
 11 15 adopted prior to the date required for dissolution or prior to
 11 16 the date to which the rural improvement zone was previously
 11 17 extended by the board of supervisors under the provisions of
 11 18 the bill.  Each extension shall be for a period of 20 years.
 11 19    The bill updates language relating to the disposition of
 11 20 property upon dissolution of the zone and specifies that any
 11 21 collection of, or division of, property taxes under Code
 11 22 chapter 357H ceases immediately upon dissolution of the zone.
 11 23    Under the bill, the rural improvement zone's board of
 11 24 trustees must file a petition with the board of supervisors
 11 25 requesting an extension of the dissolution date. The petition
 11 26 must state the continued need for the rural improvement zone
 11 27 and describe the improvements needed in the zone beyond the
 11 28 dissolution date otherwise required by the bill. Within 90
 11 29 days after receiving the petition, the board of supervisors
 11 30 must either adopt a resolution granting the 20=year extension
 11 31 without further proceedings, or notify the board of trustees in
 11 32 writing of the board's intent to review the zone's dissolution
 11 33 date.  The board may, as part of its notice to the board of

 12  4 The board of supervisors requests additional information from
 12  5 the board of trustees. As part of the board of supervisors'
 12  6 further review of the petition, a public hearing must be held
 12  7 within the period of time specified in the bill.  Within
 12  8 10 days after the public hearing, the board of supervisors
 12  9 is required to either find a continued need for the rural
 12 10 improvement zone and adopt a resolution approving the 20=year

 12 13 extension.  If the board fails to either approve or deny the
 12 14 extension within the 10=day period, the request for a 20=year
