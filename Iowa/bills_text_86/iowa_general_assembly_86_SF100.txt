  3 12 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  3 13 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  3 14    This bill creates an uninsured, hit=and=run, and
  3 15 underinsured motor vehicle coverage trust fund under the
  3 16 control of the commissioner of insurance.  Moneys in the
  3 17 fund are to be used to reimburse insurers for claims paid
  3 18 under uninsured or hit=and=run motor vehicle coverage and
  3 19 underinsured motor vehicle coverage provided with motor vehicle
  3 20 liability insurance policies.  The bill directs the insurance
  3 21 commissioner to adopt administrative rules establishing
  3 22 a process by which insurers may qualify and apply for
  3 23 reimbursement from the fund.  In order to make the distribution
  3 24 of payments as equitable as possible among insurers, the
  3 25 commissioner is authorized to establish a limit on the amount
  3 26 of reimbursement allowed for any claim.
  3 27    Under the bill, the source of revenue for the uninsured,
  3 28 hit=and=run, and underinsured motor vehicle coverage trust fund
  3 29 is the revenue derived by cities and counties from automated
  3 30 traffic law enforcement programs.  The bill directs that, from
  3 31 the civil fines collected by a city or county from the use of
  3 32 automated traffic law enforcement systems, the amount necessary
  3 33 to satisfy the contractual obligations relating to the use of
  3 34 the systems shall be retained by the city or county.  Moneys
  3 35 in excess of that amount are to be forwarded monthly to the
  4  1 treasurer of state for deposit in the uninsured, hit=and=run,
