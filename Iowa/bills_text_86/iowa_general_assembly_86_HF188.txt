  8 22    Sec. 16.  INITIAL APPOINTMENTS.
  8 23    1.  Notwithstanding any provision to the contrary in this
  8 24 Act, the initial midwife appointees to the board of midwifery
  8 25 created pursuant to this Act shall fulfill the national
  8 26 certification requirements of the North American registry of
  8 27 midwives.
  8 28    2.  One of the initial midwife appointments to the board
  8 29 shall be appointed for a one=year term, one shall be appointed
  8 30 for a two=year term, and one shall be appointed for a
  8 31 three=year term.  The members who are licensed under chapter
  8 32 148 or 152 shall each be appointed for a two=year term, and the
  8 33 members representing the general public shall each be appointed
  8 34 to a three=year term.
  8 35    Sec. 17.  EFFECTIVE DATE.  The following provision or
  9  1 provisions of this Act take effect July 1, 2016:
  9  2    1.  The section of this Act amending section 147.2,
  9  3 subsection 1.
  9  4    2.  The section of this Act enacting section 148G.7.
  9  5                           EXPLANATION
  9  6 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  9  7 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  9  8    This bill creates new Code chapter 148G that provides for
  9  9 the licensure of midwives beginning July 1, 2016.  A midwife
  9 10 is not an allopathic or osteopathic physician licensed under
  9 11 Code chapter 148 or a nurse licensed under Code chapter
  9 12 152 providing primary maternity care during the antepartum,
  9 13 intrapartum, or postpartum period.
  9 14    The bill provides for the establishment of a seven=member
  9 15 board of midwifery consisting of three members who are
  9 16 midwives, one physician, one nurse, and two members who
  9 17 represent the general public.  The bill provides for fees to
  9 18 fund the board and provides penalties for violation of the
  9 19 licensure requirement; those penalties are set out for all
  9 20 health=related boards in Code chapters 147 and 272C.  Code
  9 21 section 147.86 provides that it is a serious misdemeanor to
  9 22 violate a provision of the licensing laws.
  9 23    The board is similar in composition and responsibilities to
  9 24 other health=related licensing boards.
  9 25    The provisions of the bill amending Code section 147.2 and
  9 26 enacting Code section 148G.7, both prohibiting the practice of
  9 27 midwifery without a license, take effect July 1, 2016.
