Section
1.
LEGISLATIVE
FINDINGS.
The
general
assembly
1


finds
and
declares
all
of
the
following:
2


1.
Health
insurers
offer
a
variety
of
health
insurance
plans
3


and
provider
network
arrangements.
4


2.
In
markets
where
health
insurers
possess
market
power,
5


health
insurers
are
able
to
use
that
power
to
compel
health
6


care
providers
to
provide
health
care
services
under
a
health
7


insurance
plan,
or
to
participate
in
a
provider
network
8


arrangement,
that
a
health
provider
might
not
otherwise
choose
9


to
provide
services
under
or
participate
in.
10


3.
Compelling
health
care
providers
to
provide
health
care
11


services
under
a
health
insurance
plan,
or
to
participate
12


in
a
provider
network
arrangement,
may
have
an
unknown
and
13


potentially
detrimental
impact
on
patients’
access
to
health
14


care
services
and
on
the
quality
of
health
care
services
15


provided.
16


4.
Compelling
health
care
providers
to
provide
health
care
17


services
under
a
health
insurance
plan,
or
to
participate
in
a
18


provider
network
arrangement,
may
also
threaten
the
financial
19


viability
of
health
care
providers
by
requiring
that
health
20


care
providers
assume
unpredictable
business
risk,
a
concern
21


that
is
particularly
acute
when
health
insurers
aggressively
22


require
health
care
providers
to
assume
financial
risk
for
23


health
care
costs,
often
under
untested
methodologies.
