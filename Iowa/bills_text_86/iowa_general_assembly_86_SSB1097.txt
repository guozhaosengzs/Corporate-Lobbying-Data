The
bill
revises
several
references
to
advanced

Currently,
the

refers

nurse
practitioners
as
people
4


“registered”
as
such
with
the
state
board
of
nursing.
The
5


bill
replaces
the

“registered”
with

The

includes
the

practitioner
in
the
term
“practice
of
nursing”
along
with
the
13


roles

and
licensed
practical
nurses.
14


Individuals
who
have
been
licensed
as
advanced
registered
nurse
15


practitioners
in
any
state
are
not
covered
by
an
exemption
to
16


the
“practice
of
nursing”
that
applies
to
unlicensed
nursing
17


students.
18


The
bill
allows
licensed
practical
nurses
and
registered
19


nurses
to
make
pronunciations
of
death
by
reporting
such
20


information
to
advanced
registered
nurse
practitioners

21


physician
assistants.
22


The
bill
allows
the
state
board
of

Currently,
if
someone
licensed
by
the
state
board
of
1


nursing
is
unable
to
practice
nursing
with
reasonable
skill
2


and
safety
due
to
illness,
substance
abuse,
or
a
mental

3


physical
condition,
the
board
may
request
the
person
to
submit
4


to
a
medical
examination
at
the
board’s
expense.
The
bill
5


eliminates
the
requirement
that
the
board
pay
for
such
an
exam.
6


Code
section
152.10
currently
allows
the
board
of

require
a

submit
to
a
medical
examination
performed
8


by
a
physician
prior
to
revoking
or
suspending
the
licensee’s
9


license.
The
bill
replaces
the
term
“physician”
with
“health
10


care
provider”.
The
bill
adds
advanced
registered
nurse
11


practitioners
to
a
limitation
on
these
examination
reports
that
12


currently
applies
to
registered
nurses
and
licensed
practical
13


nurses.
The
bill
also
allows
advanced
registered
nurse
14


practitioners
to
demonstrate
their
ability
to
resume
practicing
15


their
profession,
a
practice
currently
allowed
for
registered
16


nurses
and
licensed
practical
nurses.
