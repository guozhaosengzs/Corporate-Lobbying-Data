  1  1    Section 1.    1  1    Section 1.    1  2 supplemental levy == election.
  1  3    1.  In order to remove school district transportation costs
  1  4 from the state school foundation program, following approval at
  1  5 election under subsection 2,  the board of directors of a school
  1  6 district may certify for levy by April 15 of the school year
  1  7 preceding the budget year, a tax on all taxable property in the
  1  8 school district for a transportation cost supplemental levy.
  1  9    2.  a.  The board of directors of a school district may, on
  1 10 its own motion, or shall, upon receipt of a petition signed
  1 11 by eligible electors equal in number to at least twenty=five
  1 12 percent of the number of voters who voted at the last preceding
  1 13 regular school election, direct the county commissioner of
  1 14 elections to submit to the registered voters of the school
  1 15 district the question of whether to levy the transportation
  1 16 cost supplemental tax not to exceed an amount authorized
  1 17 under subsection 3. The question shall be submitted at an
  1 18 election held on a date specified in section 39.2, subsection
  1 19 4, paragraph "c".
  1 20    b.  If a majority of the votes cast upon the proposition is
  1 21 in favor of the proposition, the board shall annually certify
  1 22 the amount required for a fiscal year to the county board of
  1 23 supervisors. The board of supervisors shall levy the amount
  1 24 certified. The amount shall be placed in the transportation
  1 25 cost account in the general fund of the district and shall be
  1 26 used only for the purposes specified in this section.
  1 27    c.  The proposition to levy the transportation cost
  1 28 supplemental tax is not affected by a change in the boundaries
  1 29 of a school district, except as otherwise provided in this
  1 30 section. If each district involved in school reorganization
  1 31 under chapter 275 has adopted the transportation cost
  1 32 supplemental tax, and if the voters have not voted upon the
  1 33 proposition to levy the transportation cost supplemental tax
  1 34 in the reorganized district, the existing transportation
  1 35 cost supplemental tax shall be in effect for the reorganized
  2  1 district for the least amount that has been approved in any of
  2  2 the districts and until discontinued pursuant to this section.
  2  3    d.  Once approved at an election, the authority of the board
  2  4 to levy and collect the transportation cost supplemental tax
  2  5 shall continue until the board votes to rescind the levy and
  2  6 collection of the tax or the voters of the school district
  2  7 by majority vote approve the discontinuance of the levy and
  2  8 collection of the tax. The tax shall be discontinued in the
  2  9 manner provided for imposition of the tax under this section.
  2 10    3.  The amount certified by a school district for levy
  2 11 under this section for a school budget year shall not exceed
  2 12 an amount equal to the district's actual cost for all children
  2 13 transported for the budget year preceding the base year
  2 14 pursuant to section 285.1, subsection 12, less the amount
  2 15 received for transporting nonpublic school pupils under section
  2 16 285.1.  However, such resulting amount shall be reduced by
  2 17 the amount of transportation assistance aid received by the
  2 18 district under section 257.31, subsection 17, for the same
  2 19 budget year, if applicable.
  2 20    4.  a.  Revenues received by a school district from a levy
  2 21 imposed under this section shall be expended only for the
  2 22 transportation costs of the district including but not limited
  2 23 to the cost of repairing, maintaining, and fueling school
  2 24 district transportation equipment and school buses, as defined
  2 25 in section 321.1, subsection 69.
  2 26    b.  If a school district imposes the levy under this section
  2 27 for a budget year, except for transportation assistance
  2 28 aid received under section 257.31, subsection 17, and
  2 29 notwithstanding any provision of law to the contrary, the
  2 30 school district shall not use school district general fund
  2 31 revenues that are outside the district's transportation cost
  2 32 account for any purpose designated under paragraph "a" for that
  2 33 same budget year.
  2 34    5.  Except for an adjustment in the amount certified for
  2 35 levy under subsection 3, imposition of a transportation cost
  3  1 supplemental levy under this section shall not affect a school
  3  2 district's eligibility for transportation assistance under
  3  3 section 257.31, subsection 17.
  3  4    6.  Revenues received by a school district under this section
  3  5 are miscellaneous income and shall not be included in district
  3  6 cost.
  3  7    Sec. 2.  APPLICABILITY.  This Act applies to school budget
  3  8 years beginning on or after July 1, 2016.
  3  9                           EXPLANATION
  3 10 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  3 11 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  3 12    This bill authorizes the board of directors of a school
  3 13 district, following voter approval, to certify for levy a
  3 14 tax on all taxable property in the school district for a
  3 15 transportation cost supplemental levy.
  3 16    The board of directors of a school district may, on its
  3 17 own motion, or shall, upon receipt of a petition signed by
  3 18 eligible electors equal in number to at least 25 percent of
  3 19 the number of voters who voted at the last preceding school
  3 20 election, direct the county commissioner of elections to submit
  3 21 to the registered voters of the school district the question of
  3 22 whether to levy the transportation cost supplemental tax. If a
  3 23 majority of the votes cast upon the proposition is in favor of
  3 24 the proposition, the board shall annually certify the amount
  3 25 required for a fiscal year to the county board of supervisors.
  3 26 The amount collected from the levy shall be placed in the
  3 27 transportation cost account in the general fund of the district
  3 28 and shall be used only for the purposes specified in the bill.
  3 29 Once approved at an election, the authority of the board to
  3 30 levy and collect the transportation cost supplemental tax
  3 31 shall continue until the board votes to rescind the levy and
  3 32 collection of the tax or the voters of the school district
  3 33 by majority vote approve the discontinuance of the levy and
  3 34 collection of the tax.
  3 35    The amount certified by a school district for levy for a
  4  1 school budget year shall not exceed an amount equal to the
  4  2 district's actual cost for all children transported for the
  4  3 budget year preceding the base year, less the amount received
  4  4 for transporting nonpublic school pupils.  The bill provides,
  4  5 however, that such resulting amount shall be reduced by
  4  6 the amount of transportation assistance aid received by the
  4  7 district under Code section 257.31(17) for the same budget
  4  8 year, if applicable.
  4  9    The bill specifies that revenues received by a school
  4 10 district from a levy imposed under the bill shall be expended
  4 11 only for the transportation costs of the district, including
  4 12 but not limited to the cost of repairing, maintaining, and
  4 13 fueling school district transportation equipment and school
  4 14 buses.  The bill provides that except for an adjustment in
  4 15 the amount that may be certified for levy, imposition of a
  4 16 transportation supplemental levy does not affect a school
  4 17 district's eligibility for transportation assistance under Code
  4 18 section 257.31(17).
  4 19    The bill provides that if a school district imposes the
  4 20 transportation cost supplemental levy for a budget year,
  4 21 except for transportation assistance aid received under Code
  4 22 section 257.31, and notwithstanding any provision of law to the
  4 23 contrary, the school district may not use the school district's
  4 24 general fund revenues that are outside the district's
  4 25 transportation cost account for any purpose designated under
  4 26 the bill for that same budget year.
  4 27    The bill specifies that revenues received by a school
  4 28 district from a transportation cost supplemental levy are
  4 29 miscellaneous income and shall not be included in district
  4 30 cost.
  4 31    The bill applies to school budget years beginning on or after
  4 32 July 1, 2016.

  3 13 district, following voter approval, to certify for levy a
  3 14 tax on all taxable property in the school district for a
  3 15 transportation cost supplemental levy.
  3 16    The board of directors of a school district may, on its
  3 17 own motion, or shall, upon receipt of a petition signed by
  3 18 eligible electors equal in number to at least 25 percent of
  3 19 the number of voters who voted at the last preceding school
  3 20 election, direct the county commissioner of elections to submit
  3 21 to the registered voters of the school district the question of
  3 22 whether to levy the transportation cost supplemental tax. If a
  3 23 majority of the votes cast upon the proposition is in favor of
  3 24 the proposition, the board shall annually certify the amount
  3 25 required for a fiscal year to the county board of supervisors.
  3 26 The amount collected from the levy shall be placed in the
  3 27 transportation cost account in the general fund of the district
  3 28 and shall be used only for the purposes specified in the bill.
  3 29 Once approved at an election, the authority of the board to
  3 30 levy and collect the transportation cost supplemental tax
  3 31 shall continue until the board votes to rescind the levy and
  3 32 collection of the tax or the voters of the school district
  3 33 by majority vote approve the discontinuance of the levy and
  3 34 collection of the tax.
  3 35    The amount certified by a school district for levy for a
  4  1 school budget year shall not exceed an amount equal to the
  4  2 district's actual cost for all children transported for the
  4  3 budget year preceding the base year, less the amount received
  4  4 for transporting nonpublic school pupils.  The bill provides,
  4  5 however, that such resulting amount shall be reduced by
  4  6 the amount of transportation assistance aid received by the
  4  7 district under Code section 257.31(17) for the same budget
  4  8 year, if applicable.
  4  9    The bill specifies that revenues received by a school
  4 10 district from a levy imposed under the bill shall be expended
  4 11 only for the transportation costs of the district, including
  4 12 but not limited to the cost of repairing, maintaining, and
  4 13 fueling school district transportation equipment and school
  4 14 buses.  The bill provides that except for an adjustment in
  4 15 the amount that may be certified for levy, imposition of a
  4 16 transportation supplemental levy does not affect a school
  4 17 district's eligibility for transportation assistance under Code
  4 18 section 257.31(17).
  4 19    The bill provides that if a school district imposes the
  4 20 transportation cost supplemental levy for a budget year,
  4 21 except for transportation assistance aid received under Code
  4 22 section 257.31, and notwithstanding any provision of law to the
  4 23 contrary, the school district may not use the school district's
  4 24 general fund revenues that are outside the district's
  4 25 transportation cost account for any purpose designated under
  4 26 the bill for that same budget year.
  4 27    The bill specifies that revenues received by a school
  4 28 district from a transportation cost supplemental levy are
  4 29 miscellaneous income and shall not be included in district
  4 30 cost.
  4 31    The bill applies to school budget years beginning on or after
  4 32 July 1, 2016.

  4 26 the bill for that same budget year.
  4 27    The bill specifies that revenues received by a school

  3 13 district, following voter approval, to certify for levy a
  3 14 tax on all taxable property in the school district for a
  3 15 transportation cost supplemental levy.
  3 16    The board of directors of a school district may, on its
  3 17 own motion, or shall, upon receipt of a petition signed by
  3 18 eligible electors equal in number to at least 25 percent of
  3 19 the number of voters who voted at the last preceding school
  3 20 election, direct the county commissioner of elections to submit
  3 21 to the registered voters of the school district the question of
  3 22 whether to levy the transportation cost supplemental tax. If a
  3 23 majority of the votes cast upon the proposition is in favor of
  3 24 the proposition, the board shall annually certify the amount
  3 25 required for a fiscal year to the county board of supervisors.
  3 26 The amount collected from the levy shall be placed in the

  3 35    The amount certified by a school district for levy for a
  4  1 school budget year shall not exceed an amount equal to the
  4  2 district's actual cost for all children transported for the
  4  3 budget year preceding the base year, less the amount received
  4  4 for transporting nonpublic school pupils.  The bill provides,
  4  5 however, that such resulting amount shall be reduced by
  4  6 the amount of transportation assistance aid received by the
  4  7 district under Code section 257.31(17) for the same budget
  4  8 year, if applicable.
  4  9    The bill specifies that revenues received by a school
  4 10 district from a levy imposed under the bill shall be expended
  4 11 only for the transportation costs of the district, including
  4 12 but not limited to the cost of repairing, maintaining, and

  4 19    The bill provides that if a school district imposes the
  4 20 transportation cost supplemental levy for a budget year,
  4 21 except for transportation assistance aid received under Code
  4 22 section 257.31, and notwithstanding any provision of law to the
  4 23 contrary, the school district may not use the school district's
  4 24 general fund revenues that are outside the district's

  4  8 year, if applicable.
  4  9    The bill specifies that revenues received by a school

  3  9                           EXPLANATION
  3 10 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  3 11 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  3 12    This bill authorizes the board of directors of a school
  3 13 district, following voter approval, to certify for levy a
  3 14 tax on all taxable property in the school district for a
  3 15 transportation cost supplemental levy.
  3 16    The board of directors of a school district may, on its
  3 17 own motion, or shall, upon receipt of a petition signed by
  3 18 eligible electors equal in number to at least 25 percent of
  3 19 the number of voters who voted at the last preceding school
  3 20 election, direct the county commissioner of elections to submit
  3 21 to the registered voters of the school district the question of
  3 22 whether to levy the transportation cost supplemental tax. If a
  3 23 majority of the votes cast upon the proposition is in favor of
  3 24 the proposition, the board shall annually certify the amount
  3 25 required for a fiscal year to the county board of supervisors.
  3 26 The amount collected from the levy shall be placed in the
  3 27 transportation cost account in the general fund of the district
  3 28 and shall be used only for the purposes specified in the bill.
  3 29 Once approved at an election, the authority of the board to
  3 30 levy and collect the transportation cost supplemental tax
  3 31 shall continue until the board votes to rescind the levy and
  3 32 collection of the tax or the voters of the school district
  3 33 by majority vote approve the discontinuance of the levy and
  3 34 collection of the tax.
  3 35    The amount certified by a school district for levy for a
  4  1 school budget year shall not exceed an amount equal to the
  4  2 district's actual cost for all children transported for the
  4  3 budget year preceding the base year, less the amount received
  4  4 for transporting nonpublic school pupils.  The bill provides,
  4  5 however, that such resulting amount shall be reduced by
  4  6 the amount of transportation assistance aid received by the
  4  7 district under Code section 257.31(17) for the same budget
  4  8 year, if applicable.
  4  9    The bill specifies that revenues received by a school
  4 10 district from a levy imposed under the bill shall be expended
  4 11 only for the transportation costs of the district, including
  4 12 but not limited to the cost of repairing, maintaining, and
  4 13 fueling school district transportation equipment and school
  4 14 buses.  The bill provides that except for an adjustment in
  4 15 the amount that may be certified for levy, imposition of a
  4 16 transportation supplemental levy does not affect a school
  4 17 district's eligibility for transportation assistance under Code
  4 18 section 257.31(17).
  4 19    The bill provides that if a school district imposes the
  4 20 transportation cost supplemental levy for a budget year,
  4 21 except for transportation assistance aid received under Code
  4 22 section 257.31, and notwithstanding any provision of law to the
  4 23 contrary, the school district may not use the school district's
  4 24 general fund revenues that are outside the district's
  4 25 transportation cost account for any purpose designated under
  4 26 the bill for that same budget year.
  4 27    The bill specifies that revenues received by a school
  4 28 district from a transportation cost supplemental levy are
  4 29 miscellaneous income and shall not be included in district
  4 30 cost.
  4 31    The bill applies to school budget years beginning on or after
  4 32 July 1, 2016.

  2 14 pursuant to section 285.1, subsection 12, less the amount
  2 15 received for transporting nonpublic school pupils under section
  2 16 285.1.  However, such resulting amount shall be reduced by
  2 17 the amount of transportation assistance aid received by the
  2 18 district under section 257.31, subsection 17, for the same
  2 19 budget year, if applicable.
  2 20    4.  a.  Revenues received by a school district from a levy
  2 21 imposed under this section shall be expended only for the

  2 27 for a budget year, except for transportation assistance
  2 28 aid received under section 257.31, subsection 17, and
  2 29 notwithstanding any provision of law to the contrary, the
  2 30 school district shall not use school district general fund
  2 31 revenues that are outside the district's transportation cost
  2 32 account for any purpose designated under paragraph "a" for that
  2 33 same budget year.
  2 34    5.  Except for an adjustment in the amount certified for
  2 35 levy under subsection 3, imposition of a transportation cost

  4  8 year, if applicable.

  4  1 school budget year shall not exceed an amount equal to the
  4  2 district's actual cost for all children transported for the
  4  3 budget year preceding the base year, less the amount received
  4  4 for transporting nonpublic school pupils.  The bill provides,
  4  5 however, that such resulting amount shall be reduced by
  4  6 the amount of transportation assistance aid received by the
  4  7 district under Code section 257.31(17) for the same budget
  4  8 year, if applicable.
  4  9    The bill specifies that revenues received by a school

  4 14 buses.  The bill provides that except for an adjustment in
  4 15 the amount that may be certified for levy, imposition of a
  4 16 transportation supplemental levy does not affect a school
  4 17 district's eligibility for transportation assistance under Code
  4 18 section 257.31(17).
  4 19    The bill provides that if a school district imposes the
  4 20 transportation cost supplemental levy for a budget year,
  4 21 except for transportation assistance aid received under Code
  4 22 section 257.31, and notwithstanding any provision of law to the
  4 23 contrary, the school district may not use the school district's
  4 24 general fund revenues that are outside the district's
  4 25 transportation cost account for any purpose designated under
  4 26 the bill for that same budget year.
  4 27    The bill specifies that revenues received by a school
  4 28 district from a transportation cost supplemental levy are
  4 29 miscellaneous income and shall not be included in district
  4 30 cost.
  4 31    The bill applies to school budget years beginning on or after

  3 10 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  3 11 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  3 12    This bill authorizes the board of directors of a school
  3 13 district, following voter approval, to certify for levy a
  3 14 tax on all taxable property in the school district for a
  3 15 transportation cost supplemental levy.
  3 16    The board of directors of a school district may, on its
  3 17 own motion, or shall, upon receipt of a petition signed by
  3 18 eligible electors equal in number to at least 25 percent of
  3 19 the number of voters who voted at the last preceding school
  3 20 election, direct the county commissioner of elections to submit
  3 21 to the registered voters of the school district the question of
  3 22 whether to levy the transportation cost supplemental tax. If a
  3 23 majority of the votes cast upon the proposition is in favor of
  3 24 the proposition, the board shall annually certify the amount
  3 25 required for a fiscal year to the county board of supervisors.
  3 26 The amount collected from the levy shall be placed in the
  3 27 transportation cost account in the general fund of the district
  3 28 and shall be used only for the purposes specified in the bill.
  3 29 Once approved at an election, the authority of the board to
  3 30 levy and collect the transportation cost supplemental tax

  4  2 district's actual cost for all children transported for the
  4  3 budget year preceding the base year, less the amount received
  4  4 for transporting nonpublic school pupils.  The bill provides,
  4  5 however, that such resulting amount shall be reduced by
  4  6 the amount of transportation assistance aid received by the
  4  7 district under Code section 257.31(17) for the same budget
  4  8 year, if applicable.
  4  9    The bill specifies that revenues received by a school
  4 10 district from a levy imposed under the bill shall be expended

  4 13 fueling school district transportation equipment and school
  4 14 buses.  The bill provides that except for an adjustment in
  4 15 the amount that may be certified for levy, imposition of a
  4 16 transportation supplemental levy does not affect a school
  4 17 district's eligibility for transportation assistance under Code
  4 18 section 257.31(17).
  4 19    The bill provides that if a school district imposes the
  4 20 transportation cost supplemental levy for a budget year,
  4 21 except for transportation assistance aid received under Code
  4 22 section 257.31, and notwithstanding any provision of law to the
  4 23 contrary, the school district may not use the school district's
  4 24 general fund revenues that are outside the district's
  4 25 transportation cost account for any purpose designated under
  4 26 the bill for that same budget year.
  4 27    The bill specifies that revenues received by a school
  4 28 district from a transportation cost supplemental levy are
  4 29 miscellaneous income and shall not be included in district
  4 30 cost.

  2 24 district transportation equipment and school buses, as defined
  2 25 in section 321.1, subsection 69.

  2 27 for a budget year, except for transportation assistance
  2 28 aid received under section 257.31, subsection 17, and

  2 31 revenues that are outside the district's transportation cost
  2 32 account for any purpose designated under paragraph "a" for that
  2 33 same budget year.
  2 34    5.  Except for an adjustment in the amount certified for
  2 35 levy under subsection 3, imposition of a transportation cost

  2 33 same budget year.
  2 34    5.  Except for an adjustment in the amount certified for
  2 35 levy under subsection 3, imposition of a transportation cost

  3  9                           EXPLANATION
  3 10 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  3 11 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  3 12    This bill authorizes the board of directors of a school
  3 13 district, following voter approval, to certify for levy a
  3 14 tax on all taxable property in the school district for a
  3 15 transportation cost supplemental levy.
  3 16    The board of directors of a school district may, on its
  3 17 own motion, or shall, upon receipt of a petition signed by
  3 18 eligible electors equal in number to at least 25 percent of
  3 19 the number of voters who voted at the last preceding school
  3 20 election, direct the county commissioner of elections to submit
  3 21 to the registered voters of the school district the question of
  3 22 whether to levy the transportation cost supplemental tax. If a
  3 23 majority of the votes cast upon the proposition is in favor of
  3 24 the proposition, the board shall annually certify the amount
  3 25 required for a fiscal year to the county board of supervisors.
  3 26 The amount collected from the levy shall be placed in the
  3 27 transportation cost account in the general fund of the district
  3 28 and shall be used only for the purposes specified in the bill.
  3 29 Once approved at an election, the authority of the board to
  3 30 levy and collect the transportation cost supplemental tax
  3 31 shall continue until the board votes to rescind the levy and
  3 32 collection of the tax or the voters of the school district
  3 33 by majority vote approve the discontinuance of the levy and
  3 34 collection of the tax.
  3 35    The amount certified by a school district for levy for a
  4  1 school budget year shall not exceed an amount equal to the
  4  2 district's actual cost for all children transported for the
  4  3 budget year preceding the base year, less the amount received
  4  4 for transporting nonpublic school pupils.  The bill provides,
  4  5 however, that such resulting amount shall be reduced by
  4  6 the amount of transportation assistance aid received by the
  4  7 district under Code section 257.31(17) for the same budget
  4  8 year, if applicable.
  4  9    The bill specifies that revenues received by a school
  4 10 district from a levy imposed under the bill shall be expended
  4 11 only for the transportation costs of the district, including
  4 12 but not limited to the cost of repairing, maintaining, and
  4 13 fueling school district transportation equipment and school
  4 14 buses.  The bill provides that except for an adjustment in
  4 15 the amount that may be certified for levy, imposition of a
  4 16 transportation supplemental levy does not affect a school
  4 17 district's eligibility for transportation assistance under Code
  4 18 section 257.31(17).
  4 19    The bill provides that if a school district imposes the
  4 20 transportation cost supplemental levy for a budget year,
  4 21 except for transportation assistance aid received under Code
  4 22 section 257.31, and notwithstanding any provision of law to the
  4 23 contrary, the school district may not use the school district's
  4 24 general fund revenues that are outside the district's
  4 25 transportation cost account for any purpose designated under
  4 26 the bill for that same budget year.
  4 27    The bill specifies that revenues received by a school
  4 28 district from a transportation cost supplemental levy are
  4 29 miscellaneous income and shall not be included in district
  4 30 cost.
  4 31    The bill applies to school budget years beginning on or after
  4 32 July 1, 2016.

  1 25 cost account in the general fund of the district and shall be
  1 26 used only for the purposes specified in this section.
  1 27    c.  The proposition to levy the transportation cost
  1 28 supplemental tax is not affected by a change in the boundaries
  1 29 of a school district, except as otherwise provided in this
  1 30 section. If each district involved in school reorganization
  1 31 under chapter 275 has adopted the transportation cost
  1 32 supplemental tax, and if the voters have not voted upon the
  1 33 proposition to levy the transportation cost supplemental tax
  1 34 in the reorganized district, the existing transportation
  1 35 cost supplemental tax shall be in effect for the reorganized
  2  1 district for the least amount that has been approved in any of
  2  2 the districts and until discontinued pursuant to this section.
  2  3    d.  Once approved at an election, the authority of the board
  2  4 to levy and collect the transportation cost supplemental tax
  2  5 shall continue until the board votes to rescind the levy and
  2  6 collection of the tax or the voters of the school district

  2 13 transported for the budget year preceding the base year
  2 14 pursuant to section 285.1, subsection 12, less the amount
  2 15 received for transporting nonpublic school pupils under section
  2 16 285.1.  However, such resulting amount shall be reduced by
  2 17 the amount of transportation assistance aid received by the
  2 18 district under section 257.31, subsection 17, for the same
  2 19 budget year, if applicable.
  2 20    4.  a.  Revenues received by a school district from a levy
  2 21 imposed under this section shall be expended only for the
  2 22 transportation costs of the district including but not limited
  2 23 to the cost of repairing, maintaining, and fueling school
  2 24 district transportation equipment and school buses, as defined
  2 25 in section 321.1, subsection 69.
  2 26    b.  If a school district imposes the levy under this section
  2 27 for a budget year, except for transportation assistance
  2 28 aid received under section 257.31, subsection 17, and
  2 29 notwithstanding any provision of law to the contrary, the
  2 30 school district shall not use school district general fund
  2 31 revenues that are outside the district's transportation cost
  2 32 account for any purpose designated under paragraph "a" for that
  2 33 same budget year.
  2 34    5.  Except for an adjustment in the amount certified for
  2 35 levy under subsection 3, imposition of a transportation cost
  3  1 supplemental levy under this section shall not affect a school
  3  2 district's eligibility for transportation assistance under
  3  3 section 257.31, subsection 17.
  3  4    6.  Revenues received by a school district under this section
  3  5 are miscellaneous income and shall not be included in district
  3  6 cost.

  3 17 own motion, or shall, upon receipt of a petition signed by
  3 18 eligible electors equal in number to at least 25 percent of

  3 20 election, direct the county commissioner of elections to submit
  3 21 to the registered voters of the school district the question of
  3 22 whether to levy the transportation cost supplemental tax. If a
  3 23 majority of the votes cast upon the proposition is in favor of

  3 10 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  3 11 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  3 12    This bill authorizes the board of directors of a school
  3 13 district, following voter approval, to certify for levy a
  3 14 tax on all taxable property in the school district for a
  3 15 transportation cost supplemental levy.
  3 16    The board of directors of a school district may, on its
  3 17 own motion, or shall, upon receipt of a petition signed by
  3 18 eligible electors equal in number to at least 25 percent of
  3 19 the number of voters who voted at the last preceding school
  3 20 election, direct the county commissioner of elections to submit
  3 21 to the registered voters of the school district the question of
  3 22 whether to levy the transportation cost supplemental tax. If a
  3 23 majority of the votes cast upon the proposition is in favor of
  3 24 the proposition, the board shall annually certify the amount
  3 25 required for a fiscal year to the county board of supervisors.
  3 26 The amount collected from the levy shall be placed in the
  3 27 transportation cost account in the general fund of the district
  3 28 and shall be used only for the purposes specified in the bill.
  3 29 Once approved at an election, the authority of the board to
  3 30 levy and collect the transportation cost supplemental tax
  3 31 shall continue until the board votes to rescind the levy and
  3 32 collection of the tax or the voters of the school district
  3 33 by majority vote approve the discontinuance of the levy and
  3 34 collection of the tax.
  3 35    The amount certified by a school district for levy for a
  4  1 school budget year shall not exceed an amount equal to the
  4  2 district's actual cost for all children transported for the
  4  3 budget year preceding the base year, less the amount received
  4  4 for transporting nonpublic school pupils.  The bill provides,
  4  5 however, that such resulting amount shall be reduced by
  4  6 the amount of transportation assistance aid received by the
  4  7 district under Code section 257.31(17) for the same budget
  4  8 year, if applicable.
  4  9    The bill specifies that revenues received by a school
  4 10 district from a levy imposed under the bill shall be expended
  4 11 only for the transportation costs of the district, including
  4 12 but not limited to the cost of repairing, maintaining, and
  4 13 fueling school district transportation equipment and school
  4 14 buses.  The bill provides that except for an adjustment in
  4 15 the amount that may be certified for levy, imposition of a
  4 16 transportation supplemental levy does not affect a school
  4 17 district's eligibility for transportation assistance under Code
  4 18 section 257.31(17).
  4 19    The bill provides that if a school district imposes the
  4 20 transportation cost supplemental levy for a budget year,
  4 21 except for transportation assistance aid received under Code
  4 22 section 257.31, and notwithstanding any provision of law to the
  4 23 contrary, the school district may not use the school district's
  4 24 general fund revenues that are outside the district's
  4 25 transportation cost account for any purpose designated under
  4 26 the bill for that same budget year.
  4 27    The bill specifies that revenues received by a school
  4 28 district from a transportation cost supplemental levy are
  4 29 miscellaneous income and shall not be included in district
  4 30 cost.
  4 31    The bill applies to school budget years beginning on or after

  2 31 revenues that are outside the district's transportation cost
  2 32 account for any purpose designated under paragraph "a" for that
  2 33 same budget year.
  2 34    5.  Except for an adjustment in the amount certified for
  2 35 levy under subsection 3, imposition of a transportation cost
  3  1 supplemental levy under this section shall not affect a school

  3 12    This bill authorizes the board of directors of a school
  3 13 district, following voter approval, to certify for levy a
  3 14 tax on all taxable property in the school district for a

  3 16    The board of directors of a school district may, on its
  3 17 own motion, or shall, upon receipt of a petition signed by
  3 18 eligible electors equal in number to at least 25 percent of
  3 19 the number of voters who voted at the last preceding school
  3 20 election, direct the county commissioner of elections to submit
  3 21 to the registered voters of the school district the question of
  3 22 whether to levy the transportation cost supplemental tax. If a
  3 23 majority of the votes cast upon the proposition is in favor of
  3 24 the proposition, the board shall annually certify the amount
  3 25 required for a fiscal year to the county board of supervisors.
  3 26 The amount collected from the levy shall be placed in the
  3 27 transportation cost account in the general fund of the district
  3 28 and shall be used only for the purposes specified in the bill.
  3 29 Once approved at an election, the authority of the board to

  4  5 however, that such resulting amount shall be reduced by
  4  6 the amount of transportation assistance aid received by the
  4  7 district under Code section 257.31(17) for the same budget
  4  8 year, if applicable.
  4  9    The bill specifies that revenues received by a school
  4 10 district from a levy imposed under the bill shall be expended
  4 11 only for the transportation costs of the district, including
  4 12 but not limited to the cost of repairing, maintaining, and

  3 12    This bill authorizes the board of directors of a school
  3 13 district, following voter approval, to certify for levy a
  3 14 tax on all taxable property in the school district for a

  3 16    The board of directors of a school district may, on its
  3 17 own motion, or shall, upon receipt of a petition signed by
  3 18 eligible electors equal in number to at least 25 percent of
  3 19 the number of voters who voted at the last preceding school
  3 20 election, direct the county commissioner of elections to submit
  3 21 to the registered voters of the school district the question of
  3 22 whether to levy the transportation cost supplemental tax. If a
  3 23 majority of the votes cast upon the proposition is in favor of
  3 24 the proposition, the board shall annually certify the amount
  3 25 required for a fiscal year to the county board of supervisors.
  3 26 The amount collected from the levy shall be placed in the

  3 10 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  3 11 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  3 12    This bill authorizes the board of directors of a school
  3 13 district, following voter approval, to certify for levy a
  3 14 tax on all taxable property in the school district for a
  3 15 transportation cost supplemental levy.
  3 16    The board of directors of a school district may, on its
  3 17 own motion, or shall, upon receipt of a petition signed by
  3 18 eligible electors equal in number to at least 25 percent of
  3 19 the number of voters who voted at the last preceding school
  3 20 election, direct the county commissioner of elections to submit
  3 21 to the registered voters of the school district the question of
  3 22 whether to levy the transportation cost supplemental tax. If a
  3 23 majority of the votes cast upon the proposition is in favor of
  3 24 the proposition, the board shall annually certify the amount
  3 25 required for a fiscal year to the county board of supervisors.
  3 26 The amount collected from the levy shall be placed in the
  3 27 transportation cost account in the general fund of the district
  3 28 and shall be used only for the purposes specified in the bill.
  3 29 Once approved at an election, the authority of the board to
  3 30 levy and collect the transportation cost supplemental tax
  3 31 shall continue until the board votes to rescind the levy and
  3 32 collection of the tax or the voters of the school district
  3 33 by majority vote approve the discontinuance of the levy and
  3 34 collection of the tax.
  3 35    The amount certified by a school district for levy for a
  4  1 school budget year shall not exceed an amount equal to the
  4  2 district's actual cost for all children transported for the
  4  3 budget year preceding the base year, less the amount received
  4  4 for transporting nonpublic school pupils.  The bill provides,
  4  5 however, that such resulting amount shall be reduced by
  4  6 the amount of transportation assistance aid received by the
  4  7 district under Code section 257.31(17) for the same budget
  4  8 year, if applicable.
  4  9    The bill specifies that revenues received by a school
  4 10 district from a levy imposed under the bill shall be expended
  4 11 only for the transportation costs of the district, including
  4 12 but not limited to the cost of repairing, maintaining, and
  4 13 fueling school district transportation equipment and school
  4 14 buses.  The bill provides that except for an adjustment in
  4 15 the amount that may be certified for levy, imposition of a
  4 16 transportation supplemental levy does not affect a school
  4 17 district's eligibility for transportation assistance under Code
  4 18 section 257.31(17).
  4 19    The bill provides that if a school district imposes the
  4 20 transportation cost supplemental levy for a budget year,
  4 21 except for transportation assistance aid received under Code
  4 22 section 257.31, and notwithstanding any provision of law to the
  4 23 contrary, the school district may not use the school district's
  4 24 general fund revenues that are outside the district's
  4 25 transportation cost account for any purpose designated under
  4 26 the bill for that same budget year.
  4 27    The bill specifies that revenues received by a school
  4 28 district from a transportation cost supplemental levy are
  4 29 miscellaneous income and shall not be included in district
  4 30 cost.
  4 31    The bill applies to school budget years beginning on or after

  3 10 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  3 11 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  3 12    This bill authorizes the board of directors of a school
  3 13 district, following voter approval, to certify for levy a
  3 14 tax on all taxable property in the school district for a
  3 15 transportation cost supplemental levy.
  3 16    The board of directors of a school district may, on its
  3 17 own motion, or shall, upon receipt of a petition signed by
  3 18 eligible electors equal in number to at least 25 percent of
  3 19 the number of voters who voted at the last preceding school
  3 20 election, direct the county commissioner of elections to submit
  3 21 to the registered voters of the school district the question of
  3 22 whether to levy the transportation cost supplemental tax. If a
  3 23 majority of the votes cast upon the proposition is in favor of
  3 24 the proposition, the board shall annually certify the amount
  3 25 required for a fiscal year to the county board of supervisors.
  3 26 The amount collected from the levy shall be placed in the
  3 27 transportation cost account in the general fund of the district
  3 28 and shall be used only for the purposes specified in the bill.
  3 29 Once approved at an election, the authority of the board to
  3 30 levy and collect the transportation cost supplemental tax
  3 31 shall continue until the board votes to rescind the levy and
  3 32 collection of the tax or the voters of the school district
  3 33 by majority vote approve the discontinuance of the levy and
  3 34 collection of the tax.
  3 35    The amount certified by a school district for levy for a
  4  1 school budget year shall not exceed an amount equal to the
  4  2 district's actual cost for all children transported for the
  4  3 budget year preceding the base year, less the amount received
  4  4 for transporting nonpublic school pupils.  The bill provides,
  4  5 however, that such resulting amount shall be reduced by
  4  6 the amount of transportation assistance aid received by the
  4  7 district under Code section 257.31(17) for the same budget
  4  8 year, if applicable.
  4  9    The bill specifies that revenues received by a school
  4 10 district from a levy imposed under the bill shall be expended
  4 11 only for the transportation costs of the district, including
  4 12 but not limited to the cost of repairing, maintaining, and
  4 13 fueling school district transportation equipment and school
  4 14 buses.  The bill provides that except for an adjustment in
  4 15 the amount that may be certified for levy, imposition of a
  4 16 transportation supplemental levy does not affect a school
  4 17 district's eligibility for transportation assistance under Code
  4 18 section 257.31(17).
  4 19    The bill provides that if a school district imposes the
  4 20 transportation cost supplemental levy for a budget year,
  4 21 except for transportation assistance aid received under Code
  4 22 section 257.31, and notwithstanding any provision of law to the
  4 23 contrary, the school district may not use the school district's
  4 24 general fund revenues that are outside the district's
  4 25 transportation cost account for any purpose designated under
  4 26 the bill for that same budget year.
  4 27    The bill specifies that revenues received by a school
  4 28 district from a transportation cost supplemental levy are
  4 29 miscellaneous income and shall not be included in district
  4 30 cost.

  3 11 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  3 12    This bill authorizes the board of directors of a school
  3 13 district, following voter approval, to certify for levy a
  3 14 tax on all taxable property in the school district for a
  3 15 transportation cost supplemental levy.
  3 16    The board of directors of a school district may, on its
  3 17 own motion, or shall, upon receipt of a petition signed by
  3 18 eligible electors equal in number to at least 25 percent of
  3 19 the number of voters who voted at the last preceding school
  3 20 election, direct the county commissioner of elections to submit
  3 21 to the registered voters of the school district the question of
  3 22 whether to levy the transportation cost supplemental tax. If a
  3 23 majority of the votes cast upon the proposition is in favor of
  3 24 the proposition, the board shall annually certify the amount
  3 25 required for a fiscal year to the county board of supervisors.
  3 26 The amount collected from the levy shall be placed in the
  3 27 transportation cost account in the general fund of the district
  3 28 and shall be used only for the purposes specified in the bill.
  3 29 Once approved at an election, the authority of the board to

  4  4 for transporting nonpublic school pupils.  The bill provides,
  4  5 however, that such resulting amount shall be reduced by
  4  6 the amount of transportation assistance aid received by the
  4  7 district under Code section 257.31(17) for the same budget
  4  8 year, if applicable.
  4  9    The bill specifies that revenues received by a school

  4 21 except for transportation assistance aid received under Code
  4 22 section 257.31, and notwithstanding any provision of law to the
  4 23 contrary, the school district may not use the school district's
  4 24 general fund revenues that are outside the district's
  4 25 transportation cost account for any purpose designated under
  4 26 the bill for that same budget year.

  3 10 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  3 11 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  3 12    This bill authorizes the board of directors of a school
  3 13 district, following voter approval, to certify for levy a
  3 14 tax on all taxable property in the school district for a
  3 15 transportation cost supplemental levy.
  3 16    The board of directors of a school district may, on its
  3 17 own motion, or shall, upon receipt of a petition signed by
  3 18 eligible electors equal in number to at least 25 percent of
  3 19 the number of voters who voted at the last preceding school
  3 20 election, direct the county commissioner of elections to submit
  3 21 to the registered voters of the school district the question of
  3 22 whether to levy the transportation cost supplemental tax. If a
  3 23 majority of the votes cast upon the proposition is in favor of
  3 24 the proposition, the board shall annually certify the amount
  3 25 required for a fiscal year to the county board of supervisors.
  3 26 The amount collected from the levy shall be placed in the
  3 27 transportation cost account in the general fund of the district
  3 28 and shall be used only for the purposes specified in the bill.
  3 29 Once approved at an election, the authority of the board to
  3 30 levy and collect the transportation cost supplemental tax
  3 31 shall continue until the board votes to rescind the levy and
  3 32 collection of the tax or the voters of the school district
  3 33 by majority vote approve the discontinuance of the levy and
  3 34 collection of the tax.
  3 35    The amount certified by a school district for levy for a
  4  1 school budget year shall not exceed an amount equal to the
  4  2 district's actual cost for all children transported for the
  4  3 budget year preceding the base year, less the amount received
  4  4 for transporting nonpublic school pupils.  The bill provides,
  4  5 however, that such resulting amount shall be reduced by
  4  6 the amount of transportation assistance aid received by the
  4  7 district under Code section 257.31(17) for the same budget
  4  8 year, if applicable.
  4  9    The bill specifies that revenues received by a school
  4 10 district from a levy imposed under the bill shall be expended
  4 11 only for the transportation costs of the district, including
  4 12 but not limited to the cost of repairing, maintaining, and
  4 13 fueling school district transportation equipment and school
  4 14 buses.  The bill provides that except for an adjustment in
  4 15 the amount that may be certified for levy, imposition of a
  4 16 transportation supplemental levy does not affect a school
  4 17 district's eligibility for transportation assistance under Code
  4 18 section 257.31(17).
  4 19    The bill provides that if a school district imposes the
  4 20 transportation cost supplemental levy for a budget year,
  4 21 except for transportation assistance aid received under Code

  4 23 contrary, the school district may not use the school district's
  4 24 general fund revenues that are outside the district's
  4 25 transportation cost account for any purpose designated under
  4 26 the bill for that same budget year.
  4 27    The bill specifies that revenues received by a school

  3 10 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  3 11 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  3 12    This bill authorizes the board of directors of a school
  3 13 district, following voter approval, to certify for levy a
  3 14 tax on all taxable property in the school district for a
  3 15 transportation cost supplemental levy.
  3 16    The board of directors of a school district may, on its
  3 17 own motion, or shall, upon receipt of a petition signed by
  3 18 eligible electors equal in number to at least 25 percent of
  3 19 the number of voters who voted at the last preceding school
  3 20 election, direct the county commissioner of elections to submit
  3 21 to the registered voters of the school district the question of
  3 22 whether to levy the transportation cost supplemental tax. If a
  3 23 majority of the votes cast upon the proposition is in favor of
  3 24 the proposition, the board shall annually certify the amount
  3 25 required for a fiscal year to the county board of supervisors.
  3 26 The amount collected from the levy shall be placed in the
  3 27 transportation cost account in the general fund of the district
  3 28 and shall be used only for the purposes specified in the bill.
  3 29 Once approved at an election, the authority of the board to
  3 30 levy and collect the transportation cost supplemental tax
  3 31 shall continue until the board votes to rescind the levy and
  3 32 collection of the tax or the voters of the school district
  3 33 by majority vote approve the discontinuance of the levy and
  3 34 collection of the tax.
  3 35    The amount certified by a school district for levy for a
  4  1 school budget year shall not exceed an amount equal to the
  4  2 district's actual cost for all children transported for the
  4  3 budget year preceding the base year, less the amount received
  4  4 for transporting nonpublic school pupils.  The bill provides,
  4  5 however, that such resulting amount shall be reduced by
  4  6 the amount of transportation assistance aid received by the
  4  7 district under Code section 257.31(17) for the same budget
  4  8 year, if applicable.
  4  9    The bill specifies that revenues received by a school
  4 10 district from a levy imposed under the bill shall be expended
  4 11 only for the transportation costs of the district, including
  4 12 but not limited to the cost of repairing, maintaining, and
  4 13 fueling school district transportation equipment and school
  4 14 buses.  The bill provides that except for an adjustment in
  4 15 the amount that may be certified for levy, imposition of a
  4 16 transportation supplemental levy does not affect a school
  4 17 district's eligibility for transportation assistance under Code
  4 18 section 257.31(17).
  4 19    The bill provides that if a school district imposes the
  4 20 transportation cost supplemental levy for a budget year,
