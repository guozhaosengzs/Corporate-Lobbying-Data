  1  1    Section 1.  FINDINGS.  The general assembly finds all of the
  1  2 following:
  1  3    1.  Abortion can cause serious short=term and long=term
  1  4 physical and psychological complications for women including
  1  5 but not limited to uterine perforation, uterine scarring,
  1  6 cervical perforation or other injury, infection, bleeding,
  1  7 hemorrhage, blood clots, failure to actually terminate the
  1  8 pregnancy, incomplete abortion or retained tissue, pelvic
  1  9 inflammatory disease, endometritis, missed ectopic pregnancy,
  1 10 cardiac arrest, respiratory arrest, renal failure, metabolic
  1 11 disorder, shock, embolism, coma, placenta previa in subsequent
  1 12 pregnancies, preterm delivery in subsequent pregnancies,
  1 13 free fluid in the abdomen, organ damage, adverse reactions
  1 14 to anesthesia and other drugs, psychological or emotional
  1 15 complications such as depression, anxiety, sleeping disorders,
  1 16 and death.
  1 17    2.  Abortion has a higher medical risk when the procedure is
  1 18 performed later in the pregnancy.  Compared to an abortion at
  1 19 eight weeks' gestation or earlier, the relative risk increases
  1 20 exponentially at higher gestations.  The incidence of major
  1 21 complications is highest after twenty weeks of gestation.
  1 22    3.  The state has a legitimate concern for the public's
  1 23 health and safety.
  1 24    4.  The state has a legitimate interest from the outset
  1 25 of pregnancy in protecting the health of the woman.  More
  1 26 specifically, the state has a legitimate concern with the
  1 27 health of women who undergo abortions.
  1 28    5.  There is substantial evidence that by at least twenty
  1 29 weeks after fertilization, an unborn child has the physical
  1 30 structures necessary to experience pain.
  1 31    6.  There is substantial evidence that by twenty weeks
  1 32 after fertilization, an unborn child seeks to evade certain
  1 33 stimuli in a manner which, in an infant or an adult, would be
  1 34 interpreted as a response to pain.
  1 35    7.  Anesthesia is routinely administered to an unborn child
  2  1 twenty weeks or more after fertilization when the unborn child
  2  2 undergoes prenatal surgery.
  2  3    8.  Even before twenty weeks after fertilization, the unborn
  2  4 child has been observed to exhibit hormonal stress responses to
  2  5 painful stimuli, and a reduction in such response results when
  2  6 pain medication is administered directly to the unborn child.
  2  7    9.  It is the purpose of the state of Iowa to assert a
  2  8 compelling state interest in protecting the unborn child from
  2  9 the stage at which substantial medical evidence indicates the
  2 10 unborn child is capable of feeling pain.

  1  3    1.  Abortion can cause serious short=term and long=term
  1  4 physical and psychological complications for women including
  1  5 but not limited to uterine perforation, uterine scarring,
  1  6 cervical perforation or other injury, infection, bleeding,
  1  7 hemorrhage, blood clots, failure to actually terminate the
  1  8 pregnancy, incomplete abortion or retained tissue, pelvic
  1  9 inflammatory disease, endometritis, missed ectopic pregnancy,
  1 10 cardiac arrest, respiratory arrest, renal failure, metabolic
  1 11 disorder, shock, embolism, coma, placenta previa in subsequent
  1 12 pregnancies, preterm delivery in subsequent pregnancies,
  1 13 free fluid in the abdomen, organ damage, adverse reactions
  1 14 to anesthesia and other drugs, psychological or emotional
  1 15 complications such as depression, anxiety, sleeping disorders,
  1 16 and death.
  1 17    2.  Abortion has a higher medical risk when the procedure is
  1 18 performed later in the pregnancy.  Compared to an abortion at
  1 19 eight weeks' gestation or earlier, the relative risk increases
  1 20 exponentially at higher gestations.  The incidence of major
  1 21 complications is highest after twenty weeks of gestation.
  1 22    3.  The state has a legitimate concern for the public's
  1 23 health and safety.
  1 24    4.  The state has a legitimate interest from the outset
  1 25 of pregnancy in protecting the health of the woman.  More
  1 26 specifically, the state has a legitimate concern with the
  1 27 health of women who undergo abortions.
  1 28    5.  There is substantial evidence that by at least twenty
  1 29 weeks after fertilization, an unborn child has the physical
  1 30 structures necessary to experience pain.
  1 31    6.  There is substantial evidence that by twenty weeks
  1 32 after fertilization, an unborn child seeks to evade certain
  1 33 stimuli in a manner which, in an infant or an adult, would be
  1 34 interpreted as a response to pain.
  1 35    7.  Anesthesia is routinely administered to an unborn child
  2  1 twenty weeks or more after fertilization when the unborn child
  2  2 undergoes prenatal surgery.
  2  3    8.  Even before twenty weeks after fertilization, the unborn
  2  4 child has been observed to exhibit hormonal stress responses to
  2  5 painful stimuli, and a reduction in such response results when
  2  6 pain medication is administered directly to the unborn child.
  2  7    9.  It is the purpose of the state of Iowa to assert a
  2  8 compelling state interest in protecting the unborn child from
  2  9 the stage at which substantial medical evidence indicates the
  2 10 unborn child is capable of feeling pain.

  3 32 such medical examinations and tests the physician considers
  3 33 necessary in making a reasonable medical judgment to accurately
  3 34 determine the postfertilization age of the human pregnancy.
  3 35    2.  a.  A physician shall not perform or induce or attempt

  4  7 applies:
  4  8    (1)  The pregnant woman has a condition which the physician
  4  9 deems a medical emergency.
  4 10    (2)  It is necessary to preserve the life of the unborn
  4 11 child.

  4 13 subsection, the physician shall terminate the human pregnancy
  4 14 in the manner which, in the physician's reasonable medical
  4 15 judgment, provides the best opportunity for the unborn child
  4 16 to survive, unless, in the physician's reasonable medical
  4 17 judgment, termination of the human pregnancy in that manner
  4 18 would pose a greater risk than any other available method of
  4 19 the death of the pregnant woman or of the substantial and
  4 20 irreversible physical impairment of a major bodily function.
  4 21 A greater risk shall not be deemed to exist if it is based on
  4 22 a claim or diagnosis that the pregnant woman will engage in
  4 23 conduct which would result in the pregnant woman's death or in
  4 24 substantial and irreversible physical impairment of a major
  4 25 bodily function.

  5  4    d.  The method used for the abortion and, in the case of
  5  5 an abortion performed when the probable postfertilization age
  5  6 was determined to be twenty or more weeks, whether the method
  5  7 of abortion used was one that, in the physician's reasonable
  5  8 medical judgment, provided the best opportunity for the unborn
  5  9 child to survive or, if such a method was not used, the basis
  5 10 of the determination that termination of the human pregnancy
  5 11 in that manner would pose a greater risk than would any other

  5 13 substantial and irreversible physical impairment of a major
  5 14 bodily function.

  5 31 submitted only an incomplete report more than one year
  5 32 following the due date, may, in an action brought in the

  5 34 be directed by a court of competent jurisdiction to submit a
  5 35 complete report within a time period stated by court order or
  6  1 be subject to contempt of court.
  6  2    (3)  A physician who intentionally or recklessly falsifies
  6  3 a report required under this section is subject to a civil
  6  4 penalty of one hundred dollars.

  4 30    a.  If a determination of probable postfertilization age of
  4 31 the human pregnancy was made, the probable postfertilization
  4 32 age determined and the method and basis of the determination.
  4 33    b.  If a determination of probable postfertilization
  4 34 age of the human pregnancy was not made, the basis of the
  4 35 determination that a medical emergency existed.
  5  1    c.  If the probable postfertilization age of the human
  5  2 pregnancy was determined to be twenty or more weeks, the basis

  5  7 of abortion used was one that, in the physician's reasonable
  5  8 medical judgment, provided the best opportunity for the unborn
  5  9 child to survive or, if such a method was not used, the basis
  5 10 of the determination that termination of the human pregnancy
  5 11 in that manner would pose a greater risk than would any other
  5 12 available method of the death of the pregnant woman or of the

  5 14 bodily function.
  5 15    4.  a.  By June 30, annually, the department shall issue a

  5 25    b.  (1)  A physician who fails to submit a report by the end
  5 26 of thirty days following the due date shall be subject to a

  5 28 period or portion of a thirty=day period the report is overdue.
  5 29    (2)  A physician required to report in accordance with
  5 30 subsection 3 who has not submitted a report or who has

  3 29 upon such a determination made by another physician. In making
  3 30 such a determination, a physician shall make such inquiries
  3 31 of the pregnant woman and perform or cause to be performed
  3 32 such medical examinations and tests the physician considers
  3 33 necessary in making a reasonable medical judgment to accurately

  4  7 applies:
  4  8    (1)  The pregnant woman has a condition which the physician

  4 21 A greater risk shall not be deemed to exist if it is based on
  4 22 a claim or diagnosis that the pregnant woman will engage in
  4 23 conduct which would result in the pregnant woman's death or in
  4 24 substantial and irreversible physical impairment of a major
  4 25 bodily function.

  5  7 of abortion used was one that, in the physician's reasonable
  5  8 medical judgment, provided the best opportunity for the unborn
  5  9 child to survive or, if such a method was not used, the basis

  4 20 irreversible physical impairment of a major bodily function.
  4 21 A greater risk shall not be deemed to exist if it is based on

  4 23 conduct which would result in the pregnant woman's death or in
  4 24 substantial and irreversible physical impairment of a major
  4 25 bodily function.
  4 26    3.  A physician who performs or induces or attempts to
  4 27 perform or induce an abortion shall report to the department,

  5  9 child to survive or, if such a method was not used, the basis
  5 10 of the determination that termination of the human pregnancy
  5 11 in that manner would pose a greater risk than would any other
  5 12 available method of the death of the pregnant woman or of the
  5 13 substantial and irreversible physical impairment of a major
  5 14 bodily function.
  5 15    4.  a.  By June 30, annually, the department shall issue a

  5 23 lead to the identification of any woman upon whom an abortion
  5 24 was performed.
  5 25    b.  (1)  A physician who fails to submit a report by the end

  5 33 manner in which actions are brought to enforce chapter 148,
  5 34 be directed by a court of competent jurisdiction to submit a

  4 15 judgment, provides the best opportunity for the unborn child
  4 16 to survive, unless, in the physician's reasonable medical
  4 17 judgment, termination of the human pregnancy in that manner
  4 18 would pose a greater risk than any other available method of
  4 19 the death of the pregnant woman or of the substantial and
  4 20 irreversible physical impairment of a major bodily function.
  4 21 A greater risk shall not be deemed to exist if it is based on

  5 11 in that manner would pose a greater risk than would any other
  5 12 available method of the death of the pregnant woman or of the
  5 13 substantial and irreversible physical impairment of a major

  8 26                           EXPLANATION
  8 27 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  8 28 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  8 29    This bill relates to abortions. The bill provides findings
  8 30 of the general assembly and definitions.
  8 31    The bill provides that, except in the case of a medical
  8 32 emergency, an abortion shall not be performed or induced
  8 33 or be attempted to be performed or induced unless the
  8 34 physician performing or inducing the abortion has first made
  8 35 a determination of the probable postfertilization age of the
  9  1 human pregnancy. Additionally, the bill prohibits a physician
  9  2 from performing or inducing or attempting to perform or induce
  9  3 an abortion upon a pregnant woman when it has been determined,
  9  4 that the probable postfertilization age is 20 or more weeks
  9  5 unless, in the physician's reasonable medical judgment, either
  9  6 the pregnant woman has a condition which the physician deems a
  9  7 medical emergency or it is necessary to preserve the life of
  9  8 the unborn child. If an abortion is performed or induced when
  9  9 the probable postfertilization age is 20 or more weeks, the
  9 10 physician is required to terminate the pregnancy in a manner
  9 11 which, in the physician's reasonable medical judgment, provides
  9 12 the best opportunity for the unborn child to survive unless
  9 13 such termination would pose a greater risk either of the death
  9 14 of the pregnant woman or of the substantial and irreversible
  9 15 physical impairment of a major bodily function of the woman
  9 16 than would another available method.
  9 17    The bill also requires certain reports to be filed by a
  9 18 physician who performs or induces or attempts to perform or
  9 19 induce an abortion with the department of public health, on
  9 20 a schedule and in accordance with forms and rules adopted by
  9 21 the department. The department is required to compile the
  9 22 information collected annually and issue a public report,
  9 23 ensuring that none of the information included in the public
  9 24 reports could reasonably lead to the identification of any
  9 25 pregnant woman upon whom an abortion was performed. The bill
  9 26 provides monetary penalties for a physician who fails to submit
  9 27 a report in a timely manner, submits an incomplete report, or
  9 28 intentionally or recklessly falsifies a required report.
  9 29    The bill provides for civil and criminal actions and
  9 30 penalties relating to violations of the bill. Failure of a
  9 31 physician to comply with any provision, with the exception of
  9 32 the late filing of a report or failure to submit a complete
  9 33 report in compliance with a court order, is grounds for license
  9 34 discipline. A physician who intentionally or recklessly
  9 35 performs or attempts to perform an abortion in violation of the
 10  1 bill is guilty of a class "C" felony, which is punishable by
 10  2 confinement for no more than 10 years and a fine of at least
 10  3 $1,000 but not more than $10,000. The bill also provides that
 10  4 a medical facility licensed in the state in which abortions
 10  5 are performed or induced in violation of the bill is subject
 10  6 to immediate revocation of licensure. Additionally, a
 10  7 medical facility licensed in this state in which abortions are
 10  8 performed or induced in violation of the bill is ineligible to
 10  9 receive state funding and is subject to repayment of any state
 10 10 funds received from the state during the time after which an
 10 11 abortion in violation of the bill was performed or induced.
 10 12 However, the woman upon whom the abortion was performed or was
 10 13 attempted to be performed is not subject to prosecution for a
 10 14 violation of the bill. The bill provides for the maintaining
 10 15 of actions by certain people based on alleged violations of
 10 16 the bill. A woman upon whom an abortion has been performed in
 10 17 violation of the bill or the biological father may maintain
 10 18 an action against the physician who performed the abortion
 10 19 in intentional or reckless violation of the bill for actual
 10 20 damages. A woman upon whom an abortion has been attempted
 10 21 in violation of the bill may maintain an action against the
 10 22 physician who attempted to perform the abortion in intentional
 10 23 or reckless violation of the bill for actual damages.
 10 24 Additionally, a cause of action for injunctive relief to
 10 25 prevent a physician from performing abortions may be maintained
 10 26 against a physician who has intentionally violated the bill by
 10 27 the woman upon whom the abortion was performed or attempted
 10 28 to be performed, by the spouse of the woman, by a parent or
 10 29 guardian of the woman if the woman is less than 18 years of
 10 30 age or unmarried at the time the abortion was performed or
 10 31 attempted to be performed, by a current or former licensed
 10 32 health care provider of the woman, by a county attorney with
 10 33 appropriate jurisdiction, or by the attorney general.
 10 34    The bill provides a process for preserving the anonymity of
 10 35 the woman upon whom an abortion has been performed or attempted
 11  1 from public disclosure if the woman does not provide consent to
 11  2 such disclosure during any proceeding or action under the bill.
 11  3    The bill also provides that the bill is not to be construed
 11  4 as creating or recognizing a right to an abortion, and the
 11  5 bill is not to be construed as determining life to begin at 20
 11  6 weeks' gestation; instead, it is recognized that life begins
 11  7 at conception.
 11  8    The bill includes a severability clause as is applicable to
 11  9 every Act or statute pursuant to Code section 4.12.

  9 12 the best opportunity for the unborn child to survive unless
  9 13 such termination would pose a greater risk either of the death
  9 14 of the pregnant woman or of the substantial and irreversible
  9 15 physical impairment of a major bodily function of the woman
  9 16 than would another available method.
  9 17    The bill also requires certain reports to be filed by a
  9 18 physician who performs or induces or attempts to perform or
  9 19 induce an abortion with the department of public health, on
  9 20 a schedule and in accordance with forms and rules adopted by
  9 21 the department. The department is required to compile the
  9 22 information collected annually and issue a public report,
  9 23 ensuring that none of the information included in the public
  9 24 reports could reasonably lead to the identification of any
  9 25 pregnant woman upon whom an abortion was performed. The bill
  9 26 provides monetary penalties for a physician who fails to submit
  9 27 a report in a timely manner, submits an incomplete report, or
  9 28 intentionally or recklessly falsifies a required report.
  9 29    The bill provides for civil and criminal actions and
  9 30 penalties relating to violations of the bill. Failure of a
  9 31 physician to comply with any provision, with the exception of
  9 32 the late filing of a report or failure to submit a complete
  9 33 report in compliance with a court order, is grounds for license
  9 34 discipline. A physician who intentionally or recklessly
  9 35 performs or attempts to perform an abortion in violation of the
 10  1 bill is guilty of a class "C" felony, which is punishable by
 10  2 confinement for no more than 10 years and a fine of at least
 10  3 $1,000 but not more than $10,000. The bill also provides that
 10  4 a medical facility licensed in the state in which abortions
 10  5 are performed or induced in violation of the bill is subject
 10  6 to immediate revocation of licensure. Additionally, a
 10  7 medical facility licensed in this state in which abortions are
 10  8 performed or induced in violation of the bill is ineligible to
 10  9 receive state funding and is subject to repayment of any state
 10 10 funds received from the state during the time after which an
 10 11 abortion in violation of the bill was performed or induced.
 10 12 However, the woman upon whom the abortion was performed or was
 10 13 attempted to be performed is not subject to prosecution for a
 10 14 violation of the bill. The bill provides for the maintaining
 10 15 of actions by certain people based on alleged violations of
 10 16 the bill. A woman upon whom an abortion has been performed in
 10 17 violation of the bill or the biological father may maintain
 10 18 an action against the physician who performed the abortion
 10 19 in intentional or reckless violation of the bill for actual
 10 20 damages. A woman upon whom an abortion has been attempted
 10 21 in violation of the bill may maintain an action against the
 10 22 physician who attempted to perform the abortion in intentional
 10 23 or reckless violation of the bill for actual damages.
 10 24 Additionally, a cause of action for injunctive relief to
 10 25 prevent a physician from performing abortions may be maintained
 10 26 against a physician who has intentionally violated the bill by
 10 27 the woman upon whom the abortion was performed or attempted
 10 28 to be performed, by the spouse of the woman, by a parent or
 10 29 guardian of the woman if the woman is less than 18 years of
 10 30 age or unmarried at the time the abortion was performed or
 10 31 attempted to be performed, by a current or former licensed
 10 32 health care provider of the woman, by a county attorney with
 10 33 appropriate jurisdiction, or by the attorney general.
 10 34    The bill provides a process for preserving the anonymity of
 10 35 the woman upon whom an abortion has been performed or attempted
 11  1 from public disclosure if the woman does not provide consent to
 11  2 such disclosure during any proceeding or action under the bill.
 11  3    The bill also provides that the bill is not to be construed
 11  4 as creating or recognizing a right to an abortion, and the
 11  5 bill is not to be construed as determining life to begin at 20
 11  6 weeks' gestation; instead, it is recognized that life begins
 11  7 at conception.
 11  8    The bill includes a severability clause as is applicable to

  8 33 or be attempted to be performed or induced unless the
  8 34 physician performing or inducing the abortion has first made
  8 35 a determination of the probable postfertilization age of the
  9  1 human pregnancy. Additionally, the bill prohibits a physician
  9  2 from performing or inducing or attempting to perform or induce
  9  3 an abortion upon a pregnant woman when it has been determined,
  9  4 that the probable postfertilization age is 20 or more weeks
  9  5 unless, in the physician's reasonable medical judgment, either
  9  6 the pregnant woman has a condition which the physician deems a

  8 27 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  8 28 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  8 29    This bill relates to abortions. The bill provides findings
  8 30 of the general assembly and definitions.
  8 31    The bill provides that, except in the case of a medical
  8 32 emergency, an abortion shall not be performed or induced
  8 33 or be attempted to be performed or induced unless the
  8 34 physician performing or inducing the abortion has first made
  8 35 a determination of the probable postfertilization age of the
  9  1 human pregnancy. Additionally, the bill prohibits a physician
  9  2 from performing or inducing or attempting to perform or induce
  9  3 an abortion upon a pregnant woman when it has been determined,
  9  4 that the probable postfertilization age is 20 or more weeks
  9  5 unless, in the physician's reasonable medical judgment, either
  9  6 the pregnant woman has a condition which the physician deems a
  9  7 medical emergency or it is necessary to preserve the life of
  9  8 the unborn child. If an abortion is performed or induced when
  9  9 the probable postfertilization age is 20 or more weeks, the
  9 10 physician is required to terminate the pregnancy in a manner
  9 11 which, in the physician's reasonable medical judgment, provides
  9 12 the best opportunity for the unborn child to survive unless
  9 13 such termination would pose a greater risk either of the death
  9 14 of the pregnant woman or of the substantial and irreversible
  9 15 physical impairment of a major bodily function of the woman
  9 16 than would another available method.
  9 17    The bill also requires certain reports to be filed by a
  9 18 physician who performs or induces or attempts to perform or
  9 19 induce an abortion with the department of public health, on
  9 20 a schedule and in accordance with forms and rules adopted by
  9 21 the department. The department is required to compile the
  9 22 information collected annually and issue a public report,
  9 23 ensuring that none of the information included in the public
  9 24 reports could reasonably lead to the identification of any
  9 25 pregnant woman upon whom an abortion was performed. The bill
  9 26 provides monetary penalties for a physician who fails to submit
  9 27 a report in a timely manner, submits an incomplete report, or
  9 28 intentionally or recklessly falsifies a required report.
  9 29    The bill provides for civil and criminal actions and
  9 30 penalties relating to violations of the bill. Failure of a
  9 31 physician to comply with any provision, with the exception of
  9 32 the late filing of a report or failure to submit a complete
  9 33 report in compliance with a court order, is grounds for license
  9 34 discipline. A physician who intentionally or recklessly
  9 35 performs or attempts to perform an abortion in violation of the
 10  1 bill is guilty of a class "C" felony, which is punishable by
 10  2 confinement for no more than 10 years and a fine of at least
 10  3 $1,000 but not more than $10,000. The bill also provides that
 10  4 a medical facility licensed in the state in which abortions
 10  5 are performed or induced in violation of the bill is subject
 10  6 to immediate revocation of licensure. Additionally, a
 10  7 medical facility licensed in this state in which abortions are
 10  8 performed or induced in violation of the bill is ineligible to
 10  9 receive state funding and is subject to repayment of any state
 10 10 funds received from the state during the time after which an
 10 11 abortion in violation of the bill was performed or induced.
 10 12 However, the woman upon whom the abortion was performed or was
 10 13 attempted to be performed is not subject to prosecution for a
 10 14 violation of the bill. The bill provides for the maintaining
 10 15 of actions by certain people based on alleged violations of
 10 16 the bill. A woman upon whom an abortion has been performed in
 10 17 violation of the bill or the biological father may maintain
 10 18 an action against the physician who performed the abortion
 10 19 in intentional or reckless violation of the bill for actual
 10 20 damages. A woman upon whom an abortion has been attempted
 10 21 in violation of the bill may maintain an action against the
 10 22 physician who attempted to perform the abortion in intentional
 10 23 or reckless violation of the bill for actual damages.
 10 24 Additionally, a cause of action for injunctive relief to
 10 25 prevent a physician from performing abortions may be maintained
 10 26 against a physician who has intentionally violated the bill by
 10 27 the woman upon whom the abortion was performed or attempted
