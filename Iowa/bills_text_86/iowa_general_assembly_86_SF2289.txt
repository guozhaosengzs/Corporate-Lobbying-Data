  1  3 valid license or temporary permit and who concludes that an
  1  4 animal is being subjected to animal cruelty shall complete an
  1  5 animal cruelty report and submit the report to a local law
  1  6 enforcement agency having jurisdiction to investigate the
  1  7 matter.  The local law enforcement agency shall file the report
  1  8 as provided in section 717B.10.
  1  9    b.  The board may adopt rules detailing any grounds or
  1 10 procedures for making a conclusion that an animal is being
  1 11 subjected to animal cruelty. However, the board is precluded
  1 12 from concluding that an animal is being subjected to animal
  1 13 cruelty if the animal is provided care in a manner that would
  1 14 meet the standard of care for that species of animal under
  1 15 state law as enforced by the department of agriculture and
  1 16 land stewardship and under federal law as enforced by the
  1 17 United States department of agriculture.  The conclusion must
  1 18 at least be based on clinical indications that if true could
  1 19 reasonably constitute elements of animal abuse in the first
  1 20 degree as described in section 717B.2, subsection 1, animal
  1 21 neglect in the first degree as described in section 717B.2B,
  1 22 subsection 1, or animal torture as described in section
  1 23 717B.3A.  Notwithstanding section 169.3, for purposes of this
  1 24 section, "animal" means the same as defined in section 717B.1.
  1 25    2.  A report shall include, to every extent known by the

  1 35 enforcement agency that may be of value in conducting a
  2  1 criminal investigation.

  2  6 information required to be completed in subsection 2.  However,
  2  7 the report must at least require the completion of information
  2  8 necessary for a law enforcement officer to interview the person
  2  9 submitting the report and conduct an investigation regarding
  2 10 the commission of a public offense described in subsection
  2 11 1. The board may consult the department of public safety when

 17 18                           EXPLANATION
 17 19 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
 17 20 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
 17 21    GENERAL.  This bill amends Code chapter 717B prohibiting
 17 22 the mistreatment of certain animals, including dogs and cats,
 17 23 but excluding other animals such as livestock (Code chapter
 17 24 717); game, fur=bearing animals, fish, reptiles, or amphibians
 17 25 (Code chapter 481A), unless such animal is owned, confined,
 17 26 or controlled by a person; or a nongame animal declared to be
 17 27 a nuisance by the natural resource commission (Code section
 17 28 481A.42).
 17 29    There are seven amended or new criminal offenses, including
 17 30 animal abuse in the first or second degree (amended Code
 17 31 section 717B.2 and new Code section 717B.2A), animal neglect
 17 32 in the first or second degree (new Code section 717B.2B
 17 33 and amended Code section 717B.3), animal torture (amended
 17 34 Code section 717B.3A), animal abandonment (new Code section
 17 35 717B.3B), and animal endangerment (new Code section 717B.3C).
 18  1  Each of the amended or new offenses includes an enhanced
 18  2 penalty that applies to a convicted person in either of two
 18  3 situations:  (1) the person is an adult who committed the
 18  4 offense in the presence of a juvenile or (2) the person has
 18  5 previously committed any of the offenses previously described;
 18  6 committed injury or interference with a police service dog
 18  7 (Code section 717B.9); committed bestiality (Code section
 18  8 717C.1); committed an offense involving animal fighting (Code
 18  9 section 717D.4); or committed any similar offense in another
 18 10 state.
 18 11    TYPES OF CRIMINAL OFFENSES == ABUSE, NEGLECT, OR TORTURE.
 18 12 Animal abuse involves injuring an animal by violence or
 18 13 poisoning; animal neglect involves failing to provide an animal
 18 14 with adequate food, water, habitable conditions, or necessary
 18 15 veterinary care; and animal torture involves inflicting upon
 18 16 the animal severe and prolonged or repeated physical pain.  For
 18 17 animal abuse in the first degree, animal neglect in the first
 18 18 degree, or animal torture, the animal must suffer a serious
 18 19 injury or death. Serious injury involves a substantial risk
 18 20 of death, protracted disfigurement, impairment, or a loss or
 18 21 impairment of a limb. For animal abuse in the second degree,
 18 22 the animal must suffer an injury meaning some impairment to the
 18 23 animal's health or functions, or death. For animal neglect in
 18 24 the second degree, the injury element is not required. For
 18 25 these offenses, the criminal penalties are as follows:  (1)
 18 26 animal abuse in the first degree, an aggravated misdemeanor
 18 27 which may be enhanced to a class "D" felony; (2) animal abuse
 18 28 in the second degree, a serious misdemeanor which may be
 18 29 enhanced to an aggravated misdemeanor; (3) animal neglect
 18 30 in the first degree, an aggravated misdemeanor which may be
 18 31 enhanced to a class "D" felony; (4)  animal neglect in the
 18 32 second degree, a serious misdemeanor which may be enhanced to
 18 33 an aggravated misdemeanor; and (5) animal torture, a class "D"
 18 34 felony which may be enhanced to a class "C" felony.
 18 35    A number of exceptions apply to the animal abuse and animal
 19  1 torture offenses, including carrying out (1) a court order; (2)
 19  2 a veterinary practice; (3) a good animal husbandry practice;
 19  3 (4) another provision of law; (5) legally hunting, trapping,
 19  4 or fishing; (6) a defense of property or life; (7) conduct
 19  5 by a local authority; and (8) research activities.  The bill
 19  6 eliminates a provision in the current abuse Code section that
 19  7 excepts an animal's owner from culpability.  The bill also
 19  8 eliminates an element of animal torture that requires proof of
 19  9 sadistic or depraved intent.
 19 10    TYPES OF CRIMINAL OFFENSES == ANIMAL ABANDONMENT AND ANIMAL
 19 11 ENDANGERMENT.  For animal abandonment, a person must knowingly
 19 12 or recklessly relinquish custody of an animal, and then fail
 19 13 to provide for its legal transfer or make arrangements for its
 19 14 care. For animal endangerment, a person must confine an animal
 19 15 in a stationary motor vehicle in a manner that endangers the
 19 16 health or life of the animal. For these last two offenses, the
 19 17 criminal penalties are the same: a simple misdemeanor which
 19 18 may be enhanced to a serious misdemeanor.
 19 19    APPLICABLE CRIMINAL PENALTIES.  The criminal penalties are
 19 20 as follows:  (1) simple misdemeanor,  confinement for no more
 19 21 than 30 days or a fine of at least $65 but not more than $625 or
 19 22 by both; (2)  serious misdemeanor, confinement for no more than
 19 23 one year and a fine of at least $315 but not more than $1,875;
 19 24 (3) aggravated misdemeanor, confinement for no more than two
 19 25 years and a fine of at least $625 but not more than $6,250; (4)
 19 26 class "D" felony, confinement for no more than five years and a
 19 27 fine of at least $750 but not more than $7,500; and (5) class
 19 28 "C" felony, confinement for no more than 10 years and a fine of
 19 29 at least $1,000 but not more than $10,000.
 19 30    COURT ORDERS.  At the time of conviction for committing
 19 31 any of the offenses, a person may be subject to a court order
 19 32 requiring a psychological or psychiatric evaluation and
 19 33 treatment.  The person may also be subject to a court order
 19 34 prohibiting the person from owning, possessing, or living with
 19 35 an animal of the same genus as the mistreated animal.  In each
 20  1 case, the court's decision to issue an order is discretionary
 20  2 except under certain conditions.  A court order requiring an
 20  3 evaluation and treatment is mandatory for juveniles.  That
 20  4 order and the order prohibiting contact with animals is
 20  5 also mandatory if the offense is punishable as an aggravated
 20  6 misdemeanor or felony.  For a discretionary court order,
 20  7 the  period of prohibition is from one to five years.  For a
 20  8 mandatory court order, the period of prohibition is as follows:
 20  9 (1)  one to five years for an aggravated misdemeanor, (2) 5 to
 20 10 15 years for a class "D" felony, and (3) life for a class "C"
 20 11 felony.
 20 12    ANIMAL RESCUE == LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICERS.  A law
 20 13 enforcement officer (e.g., county sheriff or deputy sheriff)
 20 14 is authorized to rescue an animal from a motor vehicle based
 20 15 upon the officer's reasonable belief that the animal may be
 20 16 suffering distress.  The officer must provide a written notice
 20 17 of the rescue.  After the rescue, the animal must be maintained
 20 18 as a rescued animal by the local authority until it is claimed
 20 19 or disposed of pursuant to court order.
 20 20    MANDATORY REPORTING == VETERINARIANS TO LOCAL LAW
 20 21 ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES.  A veterinarian is required to report
 20 22 cases in which an animal may have suffered a serious injury due
 20 23 to animal abuse, animal neglect, or animal torture.  The board
 20 24 of veterinary medicine may prescribe the form of the report.
 20 25 The report must be submitted to the local law enforcement
 20 26 agency  having jurisdiction of the matter.
 20 27    MANDATORY REPORTING == LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES TO THE
 20 28 DEPARTMENT OF HUMAN SERVICES.  A local law enforcement agency
 20 29 must submit a report to the department of human services if a
 20 30 law enforcement officer conducts an investigation involving
 20 31 animal abuse, animal neglect, or animal torture and reasonably

 20 33 witnessed the offense being committed.
 20 34    STATE MANDATE.  The bill may include a state mandate as
 20 35 defined in Code section 25B.3.  The bill makes inapplicable
 21  1 Code section 25B.2, subsection 3, which would relieve a
 21  2 political subdivision from complying with a state mandate if
 21  3 funding for the cost of the state mandate is not provided or

 17 18                           EXPLANATION
 17 19 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
 17 20 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
 17 21    GENERAL.  This bill amends Code chapter 717B prohibiting
 17 22 the mistreatment of certain animals, including dogs and cats,
 17 23 but excluding other animals such as livestock (Code chapter
 17 24 717); game, fur=bearing animals, fish, reptiles, or amphibians
 17 25 (Code chapter 481A), unless such animal is owned, confined,
 17 26 or controlled by a person; or a nongame animal declared to be
 17 27 a nuisance by the natural resource commission (Code section
 17 28 481A.42).
 17 29    There are seven amended or new criminal offenses, including
 17 30 animal abuse in the first or second degree (amended Code
 17 31 section 717B.2 and new Code section 717B.2A), animal neglect
 17 32 in the first or second degree (new Code section 717B.2B
 17 33 and amended Code section 717B.3), animal torture (amended
 17 34 Code section 717B.3A), animal abandonment (new Code section
 17 35 717B.3B), and animal endangerment (new Code section 717B.3C).
 18  1  Each of the amended or new offenses includes an enhanced
 18  2 penalty that applies to a convicted person in either of two
 18  3 situations:  (1) the person is an adult who committed the
 18  4 offense in the presence of a juvenile or (2) the person has
 18  5 previously committed any of the offenses previously described;
 18  6 committed injury or interference with a police service dog
 18  7 (Code section 717B.9); committed bestiality (Code section
 18  8 717C.1); committed an offense involving animal fighting (Code
 18  9 section 717D.4); or committed any similar offense in another
 18 10 state.
 18 11    TYPES OF CRIMINAL OFFENSES == ABUSE, NEGLECT, OR TORTURE.
 18 12 Animal abuse involves injuring an animal by violence or
 18 13 poisoning; animal neglect involves failing to provide an animal
 18 14 with adequate food, water, habitable conditions, or necessary
 18 15 veterinary care; and animal torture involves inflicting upon
 18 16 the animal severe and prolonged or repeated physical pain.  For
 18 17 animal abuse in the first degree, animal neglect in the first
 18 18 degree, or animal torture, the animal must suffer a serious
 18 19 injury or death. Serious injury involves a substantial risk
 18 20 of death, protracted disfigurement, impairment, or a loss or
 18 21 impairment of a limb. For animal abuse in the second degree,
 18 22 the animal must suffer an injury meaning some impairment to the
 18 23 animal's health or functions, or death. For animal neglect in
 18 24 the second degree, the injury element is not required. For
 18 25 these offenses, the criminal penalties are as follows:  (1)
 18 26 animal abuse in the first degree, an aggravated misdemeanor
 18 27 which may be enhanced to a class "D" felony; (2) animal abuse
 18 28 in the second degree, a serious misdemeanor which may be
 18 29 enhanced to an aggravated misdemeanor; (3) animal neglect
 18 30 in the first degree, an aggravated misdemeanor which may be
 18 31 enhanced to a class "D" felony; (4)  animal neglect in the
 18 32 second degree, a serious misdemeanor which may be enhanced to
 18 33 an aggravated misdemeanor; and (5) animal torture, a class "D"
 18 34 felony which may be enhanced to a class "C" felony.
 18 35    A number of exceptions apply to the animal abuse and animal
 19  1 torture offenses, including carrying out (1) a court order; (2)
 19  2 a veterinary practice; (3) a good animal husbandry practice;
 19  3 (4) another provision of law; (5) legally hunting, trapping,
 19  4 or fishing; (6) a defense of property or life; (7) conduct
 19  5 by a local authority; and (8) research activities.  The bill
 19  6 eliminates a provision in the current abuse Code section that
 19  7 excepts an animal's owner from culpability.  The bill also
 19  8 eliminates an element of animal torture that requires proof of
 19  9 sadistic or depraved intent.
 19 10    TYPES OF CRIMINAL OFFENSES == ANIMAL ABANDONMENT AND ANIMAL
 19 11 ENDANGERMENT.  For animal abandonment, a person must knowingly
 19 12 or recklessly relinquish custody of an animal, and then fail
 19 13 to provide for its legal transfer or make arrangements for its
 19 14 care. For animal endangerment, a person must confine an animal
 19 15 in a stationary motor vehicle in a manner that endangers the
 19 16 health or life of the animal. For these last two offenses, the
 19 17 criminal penalties are the same: a simple misdemeanor which
 19 18 may be enhanced to a serious misdemeanor.
 19 19    APPLICABLE CRIMINAL PENALTIES.  The criminal penalties are
 19 20 as follows:  (1) simple misdemeanor,  confinement for no more
 19 21 than 30 days or a fine of at least $65 but not more than $625 or
 19 22 by both; (2)  serious misdemeanor, confinement for no more than
 19 23 one year and a fine of at least $315 but not more than $1,875;
 19 24 (3) aggravated misdemeanor, confinement for no more than two
 19 25 years and a fine of at least $625 but not more than $6,250; (4)
 19 26 class "D" felony, confinement for no more than five years and a
 19 27 fine of at least $750 but not more than $7,500; and (5) class
 19 28 "C" felony, confinement for no more than 10 years and a fine of
 19 29 at least $1,000 but not more than $10,000.
 19 30    COURT ORDERS.  At the time of conviction for committing
 19 31 any of the offenses, a person may be subject to a court order
 19 32 requiring a psychological or psychiatric evaluation and
 19 33 treatment.  The person may also be subject to a court order
 19 34 prohibiting the person from owning, possessing, or living with
 19 35 an animal of the same genus as the mistreated animal.  In each
 20  1 case, the court's decision to issue an order is discretionary
 20  2 except under certain conditions.  A court order requiring an
 20  3 evaluation and treatment is mandatory for juveniles.  That
 20  4 order and the order prohibiting contact with animals is
 20  5 also mandatory if the offense is punishable as an aggravated
 20  6 misdemeanor or felony.  For a discretionary court order,
 20  7 the  period of prohibition is from one to five years.  For a
 20  8 mandatory court order, the period of prohibition is as follows:
 20  9 (1)  one to five years for an aggravated misdemeanor, (2) 5 to
 20 10 15 years for a class "D" felony, and (3) life for a class "C"
 20 11 felony.
 20 12    ANIMAL RESCUE == LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICERS.  A law
 20 13 enforcement officer (e.g., county sheriff or deputy sheriff)
 20 14 is authorized to rescue an animal from a motor vehicle based
 20 15 upon the officer's reasonable belief that the animal may be
 20 16 suffering distress.  The officer must provide a written notice
 20 17 of the rescue.  After the rescue, the animal must be maintained
 20 18 as a rescued animal by the local authority until it is claimed
 20 19 or disposed of pursuant to court order.
 20 20    MANDATORY REPORTING == VETERINARIANS TO LOCAL LAW
 20 21 ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES.  A veterinarian is required to report
 20 22 cases in which an animal may have suffered a serious injury due
 20 23 to animal abuse, animal neglect, or animal torture.  The board
 20 24 of veterinary medicine may prescribe the form of the report.
 20 25 The report must be submitted to the local law enforcement
 20 26 agency  having jurisdiction of the matter.
 20 27    MANDATORY REPORTING == LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES TO THE
 20 28 DEPARTMENT OF HUMAN SERVICES.  A local law enforcement agency
 20 29 must submit a report to the department of human services if a
 20 30 law enforcement officer conducts an investigation involving
 20 31 animal abuse, animal neglect, or animal torture and reasonably
 20 32 believes a minor child of the subject of the investigation
 20 33 witnessed the offense being committed.
 20 34    STATE MANDATE.  The bill may include a state mandate as
 20 35 defined in Code section 25B.3.  The bill makes inapplicable
 21  1 Code section 25B.2, subsection 3, which would relieve a
 21  2 political subdivision from complying with a state mandate if
 21  3 funding for the cost of the state mandate is not provided or
 21  4 specified.  Therefore, political subdivisions are required to

 17 19 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
 17 20 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
 17 21    GENERAL.  This bill amends Code chapter 717B prohibiting
 17 22 the mistreatment of certain animals, including dogs and cats,
 17 23 but excluding other animals such as livestock (Code chapter
 17 24 717); game, fur=bearing animals, fish, reptiles, or amphibians
 17 25 (Code chapter 481A), unless such animal is owned, confined,
 17 26 or controlled by a person; or a nongame animal declared to be
 17 27 a nuisance by the natural resource commission (Code section
 17 28 481A.42).
 17 29    There are seven amended or new criminal offenses, including
 17 30 animal abuse in the first or second degree (amended Code
 17 31 section 717B.2 and new Code section 717B.2A), animal neglect
 17 32 in the first or second degree (new Code section 717B.2B
 17 33 and amended Code section 717B.3), animal torture (amended
 17 34 Code section 717B.3A), animal abandonment (new Code section
 17 35 717B.3B), and animal endangerment (new Code section 717B.3C).
 18  1  Each of the amended or new offenses includes an enhanced
 18  2 penalty that applies to a convicted person in either of two
 18  3 situations:  (1) the person is an adult who committed the
 18  4 offense in the presence of a juvenile or (2) the person has
 18  5 previously committed any of the offenses previously described;
 18  6 committed injury or interference with a police service dog
 18  7 (Code section 717B.9); committed bestiality (Code section
 18  8 717C.1); committed an offense involving animal fighting (Code
 18  9 section 717D.4); or committed any similar offense in another
 18 10 state.
 18 11    TYPES OF CRIMINAL OFFENSES == ABUSE, NEGLECT, OR TORTURE.
 18 12 Animal abuse involves injuring an animal by violence or

 18 16 the animal severe and prolonged or repeated physical pain.  For
 18 17 animal abuse in the first degree, animal neglect in the first
 18 18 degree, or animal torture, the animal must suffer a serious
 18 19 injury or death. Serious injury involves a substantial risk
 18 20 of death, protracted disfigurement, impairment, or a loss or
 18 21 impairment of a limb. For animal abuse in the second degree,
 18 22 the animal must suffer an injury meaning some impairment to the
 18 23 animal's health or functions, or death. For animal neglect in
 18 24 the second degree, the injury element is not required. For

 18 26 animal abuse in the first degree, an aggravated misdemeanor
 18 27 which may be enhanced to a class "D" felony; (2) animal abuse
 18 28 in the second degree, a serious misdemeanor which may be

 18 32 second degree, a serious misdemeanor which may be enhanced to
 18 33 an aggravated misdemeanor; and (5) animal torture, a class "D"
 18 34 felony which may be enhanced to a class "C" felony.
 18 35    A number of exceptions apply to the animal abuse and animal
 19  1 torture offenses, including carrying out (1) a court order; (2)

 18  5 previously committed any of the offenses previously described;
 18  6 committed injury or interference with a police service dog
 18  7 (Code section 717B.9); committed bestiality (Code section
 18  8 717C.1); committed an offense involving animal fighting (Code
 18  9 section 717D.4); or committed any similar offense in another
 18 10 state.
 18 11    TYPES OF CRIMINAL OFFENSES == ABUSE, NEGLECT, OR TORTURE.
 18 12 Animal abuse involves injuring an animal by violence or
 18 13 poisoning; animal neglect involves failing to provide an animal
 18 14 with adequate food, water, habitable conditions, or necessary
 18 15 veterinary care; and animal torture involves inflicting upon
 18 16 the animal severe and prolonged or repeated physical pain.  For
 18 17 animal abuse in the first degree, animal neglect in the first
 18 18 degree, or animal torture, the animal must suffer a serious
 18 19 injury or death. Serious injury involves a substantial risk
 18 20 of death, protracted disfigurement, impairment, or a loss or
 18 21 impairment of a limb. For animal abuse in the second degree,
 18 22 the animal must suffer an injury meaning some impairment to the
 18 23 animal's health or functions, or death. For animal neglect in
 18 24 the second degree, the injury element is not required. For
 18 25 these offenses, the criminal penalties are as follows:  (1)
 18 26 animal abuse in the first degree, an aggravated misdemeanor
 18 27 which may be enhanced to a class "D" felony; (2) animal abuse
 18 28 in the second degree, a serious misdemeanor which may be
 18 29 enhanced to an aggravated misdemeanor; (3) animal neglect
 18 30 in the first degree, an aggravated misdemeanor which may be
 18 31 enhanced to a class "D" felony; (4)  animal neglect in the
 18 32 second degree, a serious misdemeanor which may be enhanced to
 18 33 an aggravated misdemeanor; and (5) animal torture, a class "D"
 18 34 felony which may be enhanced to a class "C" felony.
 18 35    A number of exceptions apply to the animal abuse and animal
 19  1 torture offenses, including carrying out (1) a court order; (2)
 19  2 a veterinary practice; (3) a good animal husbandry practice;
 19  3 (4) another provision of law; (5) legally hunting, trapping,
 19  4 or fishing; (6) a defense of property or life; (7) conduct
 19  5 by a local authority; and (8) research activities.  The bill
 19  6 eliminates a provision in the current abuse Code section that
 19  7 excepts an animal's owner from culpability.  The bill also
 19  8 eliminates an element of animal torture that requires proof of
 19  9 sadistic or depraved intent.
 19 10    TYPES OF CRIMINAL OFFENSES == ANIMAL ABANDONMENT AND ANIMAL
 19 11 ENDANGERMENT.  For animal abandonment, a person must knowingly
 19 12 or recklessly relinquish custody of an animal, and then fail
 19 13 to provide for its legal transfer or make arrangements for its
 19 14 care. For animal endangerment, a person must confine an animal
 19 15 in a stationary motor vehicle in a manner that endangers the
 19 16 health or life of the animal. For these last two offenses, the
 19 17 criminal penalties are the same: a simple misdemeanor which
 19 18 may be enhanced to a serious misdemeanor.
 19 19    APPLICABLE CRIMINAL PENALTIES.  The criminal penalties are
 19 20 as follows:  (1) simple misdemeanor,  confinement for no more
 19 21 than 30 days or a fine of at least $65 but not more than $625 or
 19 22 by both; (2)  serious misdemeanor, confinement for no more than
 19 23 one year and a fine of at least $315 but not more than $1,875;
 19 24 (3) aggravated misdemeanor, confinement for no more than two
 19 25 years and a fine of at least $625 but not more than $6,250; (4)
 19 26 class "D" felony, confinement for no more than five years and a
 19 27 fine of at least $750 but not more than $7,500; and (5) class
 19 28 "C" felony, confinement for no more than 10 years and a fine of
 19 29 at least $1,000 but not more than $10,000.
 19 30    COURT ORDERS.  At the time of conviction for committing
 19 31 any of the offenses, a person may be subject to a court order
 19 32 requiring a psychological or psychiatric evaluation and
 19 33 treatment.  The person may also be subject to a court order
 19 34 prohibiting the person from owning, possessing, or living with
 19 35 an animal of the same genus as the mistreated animal.  In each
 20  1 case, the court's decision to issue an order is discretionary
 20  2 except under certain conditions.  A court order requiring an
 20  3 evaluation and treatment is mandatory for juveniles.  That
 20  4 order and the order prohibiting contact with animals is
 20  5 also mandatory if the offense is punishable as an aggravated
 20  6 misdemeanor or felony.  For a discretionary court order,
 20  7 the  period of prohibition is from one to five years.  For a
 20  8 mandatory court order, the period of prohibition is as follows:
 20  9 (1)  one to five years for an aggravated misdemeanor, (2) 5 to
 20 10 15 years for a class "D" felony, and (3) life for a class "C"
 20 11 felony.
 20 12    ANIMAL RESCUE == LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICERS.  A law
 20 13 enforcement officer (e.g., county sheriff or deputy sheriff)
 20 14 is authorized to rescue an animal from a motor vehicle based
 20 15 upon the officer's reasonable belief that the animal may be
 20 16 suffering distress.  The officer must provide a written notice
 20 17 of the rescue.  After the rescue, the animal must be maintained
 20 18 as a rescued animal by the local authority until it is claimed
 20 19 or disposed of pursuant to court order.
 20 20    MANDATORY REPORTING == VETERINARIANS TO LOCAL LAW
 20 21 ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES.  A veterinarian is required to report
 20 22 cases in which an animal may have suffered a serious injury due
 20 23 to animal abuse, animal neglect, or animal torture.  The board
 20 24 of veterinary medicine may prescribe the form of the report.
 20 25 The report must be submitted to the local law enforcement
 20 26 agency  having jurisdiction of the matter.
 20 27    MANDATORY REPORTING == LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES TO THE
 20 28 DEPARTMENT OF HUMAN SERVICES.  A local law enforcement agency
 20 29 must submit a report to the department of human services if a
 20 30 law enforcement officer conducts an investigation involving
 20 31 animal abuse, animal neglect, or animal torture and reasonably
 20 32 believes a minor child of the subject of the investigation
 20 33 witnessed the offense being committed.
 20 34    STATE MANDATE.  The bill may include a state mandate as
 20 35 defined in Code section 25B.3.  The bill makes inapplicable
 21  1 Code section 25B.2, subsection 3, which would relieve a
 21  2 political subdivision from complying with a state mandate if
 21  3 funding for the cost of the state mandate is not provided or
 21  4 specified.  Therefore, political subdivisions are required to
 21  5 comply with any state mandate included in the bill.

 17 19 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
 17 20 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
 17 21    GENERAL.  This bill amends Code chapter 717B prohibiting
 17 22 the mistreatment of certain animals, including dogs and cats,
 17 23 but excluding other animals such as livestock (Code chapter
 17 24 717); game, fur=bearing animals, fish, reptiles, or amphibians
 17 25 (Code chapter 481A), unless such animal is owned, confined,
 17 26 or controlled by a person; or a nongame animal declared to be
 17 27 a nuisance by the natural resource commission (Code section
 17 28 481A.42).
 17 29    There are seven amended or new criminal offenses, including
 17 30 animal abuse in the first or second degree (amended Code
 17 31 section 717B.2 and new Code section 717B.2A), animal neglect
 17 32 in the first or second degree (new Code section 717B.2B
 17 33 and amended Code section 717B.3), animal torture (amended
 17 34 Code section 717B.3A), animal abandonment (new Code section
 17 35 717B.3B), and animal endangerment (new Code section 717B.3C).
 18  1  Each of the amended or new offenses includes an enhanced
 18  2 penalty that applies to a convicted person in either of two
 18  3 situations:  (1) the person is an adult who committed the
 18  4 offense in the presence of a juvenile or (2) the person has
 18  5 previously committed any of the offenses previously described;
 18  6 committed injury or interference with a police service dog
 18  7 (Code section 717B.9); committed bestiality (Code section
 18  8 717C.1); committed an offense involving animal fighting (Code
 18  9 section 717D.4); or committed any similar offense in another
 18 10 state.
 18 11    TYPES OF CRIMINAL OFFENSES == ABUSE, NEGLECT, OR TORTURE.
 18 12 Animal abuse involves injuring an animal by violence or
 18 13 poisoning; animal neglect involves failing to provide an animal
 18 14 with adequate food, water, habitable conditions, or necessary
 18 15 veterinary care; and animal torture involves inflicting upon
 18 16 the animal severe and prolonged or repeated physical pain.  For
 18 17 animal abuse in the first degree, animal neglect in the first
 18 18 degree, or animal torture, the animal must suffer a serious
 18 19 injury or death. Serious injury involves a substantial risk
 18 20 of death, protracted disfigurement, impairment, or a loss or
 18 21 impairment of a limb. For animal abuse in the second degree,
 18 22 the animal must suffer an injury meaning some impairment to the
 18 23 animal's health or functions, or death. For animal neglect in
 18 24 the second degree, the injury element is not required. For
 18 25 these offenses, the criminal penalties are as follows:  (1)
 18 26 animal abuse in the first degree, an aggravated misdemeanor
 18 27 which may be enhanced to a class "D" felony; (2) animal abuse
 18 28 in the second degree, a serious misdemeanor which may be
 18 29 enhanced to an aggravated misdemeanor; (3) animal neglect
 18 30 in the first degree, an aggravated misdemeanor which may be
 18 31 enhanced to a class "D" felony; (4)  animal neglect in the
 18 32 second degree, a serious misdemeanor which may be enhanced to
 18 33 an aggravated misdemeanor; and (5) animal torture, a class "D"
 18 34 felony which may be enhanced to a class "C" felony.
 18 35    A number of exceptions apply to the animal abuse and animal
 19  1 torture offenses, including carrying out (1) a court order; (2)
 19  2 a veterinary practice; (3) a good animal husbandry practice;
 19  3 (4) another provision of law; (5) legally hunting, trapping,
 19  4 or fishing; (6) a defense of property or life; (7) conduct
 19  5 by a local authority; and (8) research activities.  The bill
 19  6 eliminates a provision in the current abuse Code section that
 19  7 excepts an animal's owner from culpability.  The bill also
 19  8 eliminates an element of animal torture that requires proof of
 19  9 sadistic or depraved intent.
 19 10    TYPES OF CRIMINAL OFFENSES == ANIMAL ABANDONMENT AND ANIMAL
 19 11 ENDANGERMENT.  For animal abandonment, a person must knowingly
 19 12 or recklessly relinquish custody of an animal, and then fail
 19 13 to provide for its legal transfer or make arrangements for its
 19 14 care. For animal endangerment, a person must confine an animal
 19 15 in a stationary motor vehicle in a manner that endangers the
 19 16 health or life of the animal. For these last two offenses, the
 19 17 criminal penalties are the same: a simple misdemeanor which
 19 18 may be enhanced to a serious misdemeanor.
 19 19    APPLICABLE CRIMINAL PENALTIES.  The criminal penalties are
 19 20 as follows:  (1) simple misdemeanor,  confinement for no more
 19 21 than 30 days or a fine of at least $65 but not more than $625 or
 19 22 by both; (2)  serious misdemeanor, confinement for no more than
 19 23 one year and a fine of at least $315 but not more than $1,875;
 19 24 (3) aggravated misdemeanor, confinement for no more than two
 19 25 years and a fine of at least $625 but not more than $6,250; (4)
 19 26 class "D" felony, confinement for no more than five years and a
 19 27 fine of at least $750 but not more than $7,500; and (5) class
 19 28 "C" felony, confinement for no more than 10 years and a fine of
 19 29 at least $1,000 but not more than $10,000.
 19 30    COURT ORDERS.  At the time of conviction for committing
 19 31 any of the offenses, a person may be subject to a court order
 19 32 requiring a psychological or psychiatric evaluation and
 19 33 treatment.  The person may also be subject to a court order
 19 34 prohibiting the person from owning, possessing, or living with
 19 35 an animal of the same genus as the mistreated animal.  In each
 20  1 case, the court's decision to issue an order is discretionary
 20  2 except under certain conditions.  A court order requiring an
 20  3 evaluation and treatment is mandatory for juveniles.  That
 20  4 order and the order prohibiting contact with animals is
 20  5 also mandatory if the offense is punishable as an aggravated
 20  6 misdemeanor or felony.  For a discretionary court order,
 20  7 the  period of prohibition is from one to five years.  For a
 20  8 mandatory court order, the period of prohibition is as follows:
 20  9 (1)  one to five years for an aggravated misdemeanor, (2) 5 to

 17 18                           EXPLANATION
 17 19 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
 17 20 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
 17 21    GENERAL.  This bill amends Code chapter 717B prohibiting
 17 22 the mistreatment of certain animals, including dogs and cats,
 17 23 but excluding other animals such as livestock (Code chapter
 17 24 717); game, fur=bearing animals, fish, reptiles, or amphibians
 17 25 (Code chapter 481A), unless such animal is owned, confined,
 17 26 or controlled by a person; or a nongame animal declared to be
 17 27 a nuisance by the natural resource commission (Code section
 17 28 481A.42).
 17 29    There are seven amended or new criminal offenses, including
 17 30 animal abuse in the first or second degree (amended Code
 17 31 section 717B.2 and new Code section 717B.2A), animal neglect
 17 32 in the first or second degree (new Code section 717B.2B
 17 33 and amended Code section 717B.3), animal torture (amended
 17 34 Code section 717B.3A), animal abandonment (new Code section
 17 35 717B.3B), and animal endangerment (new Code section 717B.3C).
 18  1  Each of the amended or new offenses includes an enhanced
 18  2 penalty that applies to a convicted person in either of two
 18  3 situations:  (1) the person is an adult who committed the
 18  4 offense in the presence of a juvenile or (2) the person has
 18  5 previously committed any of the offenses previously described;
 18  6 committed injury or interference with a police service dog
 18  7 (Code section 717B.9); committed bestiality (Code section
 18  8 717C.1); committed an offense involving animal fighting (Code
 18  9 section 717D.4); or committed any similar offense in another
 18 10 state.
 18 11    TYPES OF CRIMINAL OFFENSES == ABUSE, NEGLECT, OR TORTURE.
 18 12 Animal abuse involves injuring an animal by violence or
 18 13 poisoning; animal neglect involves failing to provide an animal
 18 14 with adequate food, water, habitable conditions, or necessary
 18 15 veterinary care; and animal torture involves inflicting upon
 18 16 the animal severe and prolonged or repeated physical pain.  For
 18 17 animal abuse in the first degree, animal neglect in the first
 18 18 degree, or animal torture, the animal must suffer a serious
 18 19 injury or death. Serious injury involves a substantial risk
 18 20 of death, protracted disfigurement, impairment, or a loss or
 18 21 impairment of a limb. For animal abuse in the second degree,
 18 22 the animal must suffer an injury meaning some impairment to the
 18 23 animal's health or functions, or death. For animal neglect in
 18 24 the second degree, the injury element is not required. For
 18 25 these offenses, the criminal penalties are as follows:  (1)
 18 26 animal abuse in the first degree, an aggravated misdemeanor
 18 27 which may be enhanced to a class "D" felony; (2) animal abuse
 18 28 in the second degree, a serious misdemeanor which may be
 18 29 enhanced to an aggravated misdemeanor; (3) animal neglect
 18 30 in the first degree, an aggravated misdemeanor which may be
 18 31 enhanced to a class "D" felony; (4)  animal neglect in the
 18 32 second degree, a serious misdemeanor which may be enhanced to
 18 33 an aggravated misdemeanor; and (5) animal torture, a class "D"
 18 34 felony which may be enhanced to a class "C" felony.
 18 35    A number of exceptions apply to the animal abuse and animal
 19  1 torture offenses, including carrying out (1) a court order; (2)
 19  2 a veterinary practice; (3) a good animal husbandry practice;
 19  3 (4) another provision of law; (5) legally hunting, trapping,
 19  4 or fishing; (6) a defense of property or life; (7) conduct
 19  5 by a local authority; and (8) research activities.  The bill
 19  6 eliminates a provision in the current abuse Code section that
 19  7 excepts an animal's owner from culpability.  The bill also
 19  8 eliminates an element of animal torture that requires proof of
 19  9 sadistic or depraved intent.
 19 10    TYPES OF CRIMINAL OFFENSES == ANIMAL ABANDONMENT AND ANIMAL
 19 11 ENDANGERMENT.  For animal abandonment, a person must knowingly
 19 12 or recklessly relinquish custody of an animal, and then fail
 19 13 to provide for its legal transfer or make arrangements for its
 19 14 care. For animal endangerment, a person must confine an animal
 19 15 in a stationary motor vehicle in a manner that endangers the
 19 16 health or life of the animal. For these last two offenses, the
 19 17 criminal penalties are the same: a simple misdemeanor which
 19 18 may be enhanced to a serious misdemeanor.
 19 19    APPLICABLE CRIMINAL PENALTIES.  The criminal penalties are
 19 20 as follows:  (1) simple misdemeanor,  confinement for no more
 19 21 than 30 days or a fine of at least $65 but not more than $625 or
 19 22 by both; (2)  serious misdemeanor, confinement for no more than
 19 23 one year and a fine of at least $315 but not more than $1,875;
 19 24 (3) aggravated misdemeanor, confinement for no more than two
 19 25 years and a fine of at least $625 but not more than $6,250; (4)
 19 26 class "D" felony, confinement for no more than five years and a
 19 27 fine of at least $750 but not more than $7,500; and (5) class
 19 28 "C" felony, confinement for no more than 10 years and a fine of
 19 29 at least $1,000 but not more than $10,000.
 19 30    COURT ORDERS.  At the time of conviction for committing
 19 31 any of the offenses, a person may be subject to a court order
 19 32 requiring a psychological or psychiatric evaluation and
 19 33 treatment.  The person may also be subject to a court order
 19 34 prohibiting the person from owning, possessing, or living with
 19 35 an animal of the same genus as the mistreated animal.  In each
 20  1 case, the court's decision to issue an order is discretionary
 20  2 except under certain conditions.  A court order requiring an
 20  3 evaluation and treatment is mandatory for juveniles.  That
 20  4 order and the order prohibiting contact with animals is
 20  5 also mandatory if the offense is punishable as an aggravated
 20  6 misdemeanor or felony.  For a discretionary court order,
 20  7 the  period of prohibition is from one to five years.  For a
 20  8 mandatory court order, the period of prohibition is as follows:
 20  9 (1)  one to five years for an aggravated misdemeanor, (2) 5 to
 20 10 15 years for a class "D" felony, and (3) life for a class "C"
 20 11 felony.
 20 12    ANIMAL RESCUE == LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICERS.  A law
 20 13 enforcement officer (e.g., county sheriff or deputy sheriff)
 20 14 is authorized to rescue an animal from a motor vehicle based
 20 15 upon the officer's reasonable belief that the animal may be
 20 16 suffering distress.  The officer must provide a written notice
 20 17 of the rescue.  After the rescue, the animal must be maintained
 20 18 as a rescued animal by the local authority until it is claimed
 20 19 or disposed of pursuant to court order.

 20 21 ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES.  A veterinarian is required to report
 20 22 cases in which an animal may have suffered a serious injury due
 20 23 to animal abuse, animal neglect, or animal torture.  The board
 20 24 of veterinary medicine may prescribe the form of the report.
 20 25 The report must be submitted to the local law enforcement
 20 26 agency  having jurisdiction of the matter.
 20 27    MANDATORY REPORTING == LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES TO THE
 20 28 DEPARTMENT OF HUMAN SERVICES.  A local law enforcement agency
 20 29 must submit a report to the department of human services if a
 20 30 law enforcement officer conducts an investigation involving
 20 31 animal abuse, animal neglect, or animal torture and reasonably
 20 32 believes a minor child of the subject of the investigation
 20 33 witnessed the offense being committed.
 20 34    STATE MANDATE.  The bill may include a state mandate as
 20 35 defined in Code section 25B.3.  The bill makes inapplicable
 21  1 Code section 25B.2, subsection 3, which would relieve a
 21  2 political subdivision from complying with a state mandate if
 21  3 funding for the cost of the state mandate is not provided or
 21  4 specified.  Therefore, political subdivisions are required to
 21  5 comply with any state mandate included in the bill.

 18 24 the second degree, the injury element is not required. For
 18 25 these offenses, the criminal penalties are as follows:  (1)
 18 26 animal abuse in the first degree, an aggravated misdemeanor
 18 27 which may be enhanced to a class "D" felony; (2) animal abuse
 18 28 in the second degree, a serious misdemeanor which may be
 18 29 enhanced to an aggravated misdemeanor; (3) animal neglect
 18 30 in the first degree, an aggravated misdemeanor which may be
 18 31 enhanced to a class "D" felony; (4)  animal neglect in the
 18 32 second degree, a serious misdemeanor which may be enhanced to
 18 33 an aggravated misdemeanor; and (5) animal torture, a class "D"
 18 34 felony which may be enhanced to a class "C" felony.
 18 35    A number of exceptions apply to the animal abuse and animal
 19  1 torture offenses, including carrying out (1) a court order; (2)
 19  2 a veterinary practice; (3) a good animal husbandry practice;
 19  3 (4) another provision of law; (5) legally hunting, trapping,
 19  4 or fishing; (6) a defense of property or life; (7) conduct
 19  5 by a local authority; and (8) research activities.  The bill
 19  6 eliminates a provision in the current abuse Code section that
 19  7 excepts an animal's owner from culpability.  The bill also
 19  8 eliminates an element of animal torture that requires proof of
 19  9 sadistic or depraved intent.
 19 10    TYPES OF CRIMINAL OFFENSES == ANIMAL ABANDONMENT AND ANIMAL
 19 11 ENDANGERMENT.  For animal abandonment, a person must knowingly
 19 12 or recklessly relinquish custody of an animal, and then fail
 19 13 to provide for its legal transfer or make arrangements for its
 19 14 care. For animal endangerment, a person must confine an animal
 19 15 in a stationary motor vehicle in a manner that endangers the
 19 16 health or life of the animal. For these last two offenses, the
 19 17 criminal penalties are the same: a simple misdemeanor which
 19 18 may be enhanced to a serious misdemeanor.
 19 19    APPLICABLE CRIMINAL PENALTIES.  The criminal penalties are
 19 20 as follows:  (1) simple misdemeanor,  confinement for no more
 19 21 than 30 days or a fine of at least $65 but not more than $625 or
 19 22 by both; (2)  serious misdemeanor, confinement for no more than
 19 23 one year and a fine of at least $315 but not more than $1,875;
 19 24 (3) aggravated misdemeanor, confinement for no more than two
 19 25 years and a fine of at least $625 but not more than $6,250; (4)
 19 26 class "D" felony, confinement for no more than five years and a
 19 27 fine of at least $750 but not more than $7,500; and (5) class
 19 28 "C" felony, confinement for no more than 10 years and a fine of
 19 29 at least $1,000 but not more than $10,000.
 19 30    COURT ORDERS.  At the time of conviction for committing
 19 31 any of the offenses, a person may be subject to a court order
 19 32 requiring a psychological or psychiatric evaluation and
 19 33 treatment.  The person may also be subject to a court order
 19 34 prohibiting the person from owning, possessing, or living with
 19 35 an animal of the same genus as the mistreated animal.  In each
 20  1 case, the court's decision to issue an order is discretionary
 20  2 except under certain conditions.  A court order requiring an
 20  3 evaluation and treatment is mandatory for juveniles.  That
 20  4 order and the order prohibiting contact with animals is
 20  5 also mandatory if the offense is punishable as an aggravated
 20  6 misdemeanor or felony.  For a discretionary court order,
 20  7 the  period of prohibition is from one to five years.  For a
 20  8 mandatory court order, the period of prohibition is as follows:
 20  9 (1)  one to five years for an aggravated misdemeanor, (2) 5 to
 20 10 15 years for a class "D" felony, and (3) life for a class "C"
 20 11 felony.
 20 12    ANIMAL RESCUE == LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICERS.  A law
 20 13 enforcement officer (e.g., county sheriff or deputy sheriff)
 20 14 is authorized to rescue an animal from a motor vehicle based
 20 15 upon the officer's reasonable belief that the animal may be
 20 16 suffering distress.  The officer must provide a written notice
 20 17 of the rescue.  After the rescue, the animal must be maintained
 20 18 as a rescued animal by the local authority until it is claimed
 20 19 or disposed of pursuant to court order.
 20 20    MANDATORY REPORTING == VETERINARIANS TO LOCAL LAW
 20 21 ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES.  A veterinarian is required to report
 20 22 cases in which an animal may have suffered a serious injury due
 20 23 to animal abuse, animal neglect, or animal torture.  The board
 20 24 of veterinary medicine may prescribe the form of the report.
 20 25 The report must be submitted to the local law enforcement
 20 26 agency  having jurisdiction of the matter.
 20 27    MANDATORY REPORTING == LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES TO THE
 20 28 DEPARTMENT OF HUMAN SERVICES.  A local law enforcement agency
 20 29 must submit a report to the department of human services if a
 20 30 law enforcement officer conducts an investigation involving
 20 31 animal abuse, animal neglect, or animal torture and reasonably
 20 32 believes a minor child of the subject of the investigation
 20 33 witnessed the offense being committed.
 20 34    STATE MANDATE.  The bill may include a state mandate as
 20 35 defined in Code section 25B.3.  The bill makes inapplicable
 21  1 Code section 25B.2, subsection 3, which would relieve a
 21  2 political subdivision from complying with a state mandate if
 21  3 funding for the cost of the state mandate is not provided or
 21  4 specified.  Therefore, political subdivisions are required to
 21  5 comply with any state mandate included in the bill.

 17 19 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
 17 20 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
 17 21    GENERAL.  This bill amends Code chapter 717B prohibiting
 17 22 the mistreatment of certain animals, including dogs and cats,
 17 23 but excluding other animals such as livestock (Code chapter
 17 24 717); game, fur=bearing animals, fish, reptiles, or amphibians
 17 25 (Code chapter 481A), unless such animal is owned, confined,
 17 26 or controlled by a person; or a nongame animal declared to be
 17 27 a nuisance by the natural resource commission (Code section
 17 28 481A.42).
 17 29    There are seven amended or new criminal offenses, including
 17 30 animal abuse in the first or second degree (amended Code
 17 31 section 717B.2 and new Code section 717B.2A), animal neglect
 17 32 in the first or second degree (new Code section 717B.2B
 17 33 and amended Code section 717B.3), animal torture (amended
 17 34 Code section 717B.3A), animal abandonment (new Code section
 17 35 717B.3B), and animal endangerment (new Code section 717B.3C).
 18  1  Each of the amended or new offenses includes an enhanced
 18  2 penalty that applies to a convicted person in either of two
 18  3 situations:  (1) the person is an adult who committed the
 18  4 offense in the presence of a juvenile or (2) the person has
 18  5 previously committed any of the offenses previously described;
 18  6 committed injury or interference with a police service dog
 18  7 (Code section 717B.9); committed bestiality (Code section
 18  8 717C.1); committed an offense involving animal fighting (Code
 18  9 section 717D.4); or committed any similar offense in another
 18 10 state.
 18 11    TYPES OF CRIMINAL OFFENSES == ABUSE, NEGLECT, OR TORTURE.
 18 12 Animal abuse involves injuring an animal by violence or
 18 13 poisoning; animal neglect involves failing to provide an animal
 18 14 with adequate food, water, habitable conditions, or necessary
 18 15 veterinary care; and animal torture involves inflicting upon
 18 16 the animal severe and prolonged or repeated physical pain.  For
 18 17 animal abuse in the first degree, animal neglect in the first
 18 18 degree, or animal torture, the animal must suffer a serious
 18 19 injury or death. Serious injury involves a substantial risk
 18 20 of death, protracted disfigurement, impairment, or a loss or
 18 21 impairment of a limb. For animal abuse in the second degree,
 18 22 the animal must suffer an injury meaning some impairment to the
 18 23 animal's health or functions, or death. For animal neglect in
 18 24 the second degree, the injury element is not required. For
 18 25 these offenses, the criminal penalties are as follows:  (1)
 18 26 animal abuse in the first degree, an aggravated misdemeanor
 18 27 which may be enhanced to a class "D" felony; (2) animal abuse
 18 28 in the second degree, a serious misdemeanor which may be
 18 29 enhanced to an aggravated misdemeanor; (3) animal neglect
 18 30 in the first degree, an aggravated misdemeanor which may be
 18 31 enhanced to a class "D" felony; (4)  animal neglect in the
 18 32 second degree, a serious misdemeanor which may be enhanced to
 18 33 an aggravated misdemeanor; and (5) animal torture, a class "D"
 18 34 felony which may be enhanced to a class "C" felony.
 18 35    A number of exceptions apply to the animal abuse and animal
 19  1 torture offenses, including carrying out (1) a court order; (2)
 19  2 a veterinary practice; (3) a good animal husbandry practice;
 19  3 (4) another provision of law; (5) legally hunting, trapping,
 19  4 or fishing; (6) a defense of property or life; (7) conduct
 19  5 by a local authority; and (8) research activities.  The bill
 19  6 eliminates a provision in the current abuse Code section that
 19  7 excepts an animal's owner from culpability.  The bill also
 19  8 eliminates an element of animal torture that requires proof of
 19  9 sadistic or depraved intent.
 19 10    TYPES OF CRIMINAL OFFENSES == ANIMAL ABANDONMENT AND ANIMAL
 19 11 ENDANGERMENT.  For animal abandonment, a person must knowingly
 19 12 or recklessly relinquish custody of an animal, and then fail
 19 13 to provide for its legal transfer or make arrangements for its
 19 14 care. For animal endangerment, a person must confine an animal
 19 15 in a stationary motor vehicle in a manner that endangers the
 19 16 health or life of the animal. For these last two offenses, the
 19 17 criminal penalties are the same: a simple misdemeanor which
 19 18 may be enhanced to a serious misdemeanor.
 19 19    APPLICABLE CRIMINAL PENALTIES.  The criminal penalties are
 19 20 as follows:  (1) simple misdemeanor,  confinement for no more
 19 21 than 30 days or a fine of at least $65 but not more than $625 or
 19 22 by both; (2)  serious misdemeanor, confinement for no more than
 19 23 one year and a fine of at least $315 but not more than $1,875;
 19 24 (3) aggravated misdemeanor, confinement for no more than two
 19 25 years and a fine of at least $625 but not more than $6,250; (4)
 19 26 class "D" felony, confinement for no more than five years and a
 19 27 fine of at least $750 but not more than $7,500; and (5) class
 19 28 "C" felony, confinement for no more than 10 years and a fine of
 19 29 at least $1,000 but not more than $10,000.
 19 30    COURT ORDERS.  At the time of conviction for committing
 19 31 any of the offenses, a person may be subject to a court order
 19 32 requiring a psychological or psychiatric evaluation and
 19 33 treatment.  The person may also be subject to a court order
 19 34 prohibiting the person from owning, possessing, or living with
 19 35 an animal of the same genus as the mistreated animal.  In each
 20  1 case, the court's decision to issue an order is discretionary
 20  2 except under certain conditions.  A court order requiring an
 20  3 evaluation and treatment is mandatory for juveniles.  That
 20  4 order and the order prohibiting contact with animals is
 20  5 also mandatory if the offense is punishable as an aggravated
 20  6 misdemeanor or felony.  For a discretionary court order,
 20  7 the  period of prohibition is from one to five years.  For a
 20  8 mandatory court order, the period of prohibition is as follows:
 20  9 (1)  one to five years for an aggravated misdemeanor, (2) 5 to
 20 10 15 years for a class "D" felony, and (3) life for a class "C"
 20 11 felony.

 20 29 must submit a report to the department of human services if a
 20 30 law enforcement officer conducts an investigation involving
 20 31 animal abuse, animal neglect, or animal torture and reasonably
 20 32 believes a minor child of the subject of the investigation
 20 33 witnessed the offense being committed.

 17 18                           EXPLANATION
 17 19 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
 17 20 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
 17 21    GENERAL.  This bill amends Code chapter 717B prohibiting
 17 22 the mistreatment of certain animals, including dogs and cats,
 17 23 but excluding other animals such as livestock (Code chapter
 17 24 717); game, fur=bearing animals, fish, reptiles, or amphibians
 17 25 (Code chapter 481A), unless such animal is owned, confined,
 17 26 or controlled by a person; or a nongame animal declared to be
 17 27 a nuisance by the natural resource commission (Code section
 17 28 481A.42).
 17 29    There are seven amended or new criminal offenses, including
 17 30 animal abuse in the first or second degree (amended Code
 17 31 section 717B.2 and new Code section 717B.2A), animal neglect
 17 32 in the first or second degree (new Code section 717B.2B
 17 33 and amended Code section 717B.3), animal torture (amended
 17 34 Code section 717B.3A), animal abandonment (new Code section
 17 35 717B.3B), and animal endangerment (new Code section 717B.3C).
 18  1  Each of the amended or new offenses includes an enhanced
 18  2 penalty that applies to a convicted person in either of two
 18  3 situations:  (1) the person is an adult who committed the
 18  4 offense in the presence of a juvenile or (2) the person has
 18  5 previously committed any of the offenses previously described;
 18  6 committed injury or interference with a police service dog
 18  7 (Code section 717B.9); committed bestiality (Code section
 18  8 717C.1); committed an offense involving animal fighting (Code
 18  9 section 717D.4); or committed any similar offense in another
 18 10 state.
 18 11    TYPES OF CRIMINAL OFFENSES == ABUSE, NEGLECT, OR TORTURE.
 18 12 Animal abuse involves injuring an animal by violence or
 18 13 poisoning; animal neglect involves failing to provide an animal
 18 14 with adequate food, water, habitable conditions, or necessary
 18 15 veterinary care; and animal torture involves inflicting upon
 18 16 the animal severe and prolonged or repeated physical pain.  For
 18 17 animal abuse in the first degree, animal neglect in the first
 18 18 degree, or animal torture, the animal must suffer a serious
 18 19 injury or death. Serious injury involves a substantial risk
 18 20 of death, protracted disfigurement, impairment, or a loss or
 18 21 impairment of a limb. For animal abuse in the second degree,
 18 22 the animal must suffer an injury meaning some impairment to the
 18 23 animal's health or functions, or death. For animal neglect in
 18 24 the second degree, the injury element is not required. For
 18 25 these offenses, the criminal penalties are as follows:  (1)
 18 26 animal abuse in the first degree, an aggravated misdemeanor
 18 27 which may be enhanced to a class "D" felony; (2) animal abuse
 18 28 in the second degree, a serious misdemeanor which may be
 18 29 enhanced to an aggravated misdemeanor; (3) animal neglect
 18 30 in the first degree, an aggravated misdemeanor which may be
 18 31 enhanced to a class "D" felony; (4)  animal neglect in the
 18 32 second degree, a serious misdemeanor which may be enhanced to
 18 33 an aggravated misdemeanor; and (5) animal torture, a class "D"
 18 34 felony which may be enhanced to a class "C" felony.
 18 35    A number of exceptions apply to the animal abuse and animal
 19  1 torture offenses, including carrying out (1) a court order; (2)
 19  2 a veterinary practice; (3) a good animal husbandry practice;
 19  3 (4) another provision of law; (5) legally hunting, trapping,
 19  4 or fishing; (6) a defense of property or life; (7) conduct
 19  5 by a local authority; and (8) research activities.  The bill
 19  6 eliminates a provision in the current abuse Code section that
 19  7 excepts an animal's owner from culpability.  The bill also
 19  8 eliminates an element of animal torture that requires proof of
 19  9 sadistic or depraved intent.
 19 10    TYPES OF CRIMINAL OFFENSES == ANIMAL ABANDONMENT AND ANIMAL
 19 11 ENDANGERMENT.  For animal abandonment, a person must knowingly
 19 12 or recklessly relinquish custody of an animal, and then fail
 19 13 to provide for its legal transfer or make arrangements for its
 19 14 care. For animal endangerment, a person must confine an animal
 19 15 in a stationary motor vehicle in a manner that endangers the
 19 16 health or life of the animal. For these last two offenses, the
 19 17 criminal penalties are the same: a simple misdemeanor which
 19 18 may be enhanced to a serious misdemeanor.
 19 19    APPLICABLE CRIMINAL PENALTIES.  The criminal penalties are
 19 20 as follows:  (1) simple misdemeanor,  confinement for no more
 19 21 than 30 days or a fine of at least $65 but not more than $625 or
 19 22 by both; (2)  serious misdemeanor, confinement for no more than
 19 23 one year and a fine of at least $315 but not more than $1,875;
 19 24 (3) aggravated misdemeanor, confinement for no more than two
 19 25 years and a fine of at least $625 but not more than $6,250; (4)
 19 26 class "D" felony, confinement for no more than five years and a
 19 27 fine of at least $750 but not more than $7,500; and (5) class
 19 28 "C" felony, confinement for no more than 10 years and a fine of
 19 29 at least $1,000 but not more than $10,000.
 19 30    COURT ORDERS.  At the time of conviction for committing
 19 31 any of the offenses, a person may be subject to a court order
 19 32 requiring a psychological or psychiatric evaluation and
 19 33 treatment.  The person may also be subject to a court order
 19 34 prohibiting the person from owning, possessing, or living with
 19 35 an animal of the same genus as the mistreated animal.  In each
 20  1 case, the court's decision to issue an order is discretionary
 20  2 except under certain conditions.  A court order requiring an
 20  3 evaluation and treatment is mandatory for juveniles.  That
 20  4 order and the order prohibiting contact with animals is
 20  5 also mandatory if the offense is punishable as an aggravated
 20  6 misdemeanor or felony.  For a discretionary court order,
 20  7 the  period of prohibition is from one to five years.  For a
 20  8 mandatory court order, the period of prohibition is as follows:
 20  9 (1)  one to five years for an aggravated misdemeanor, (2) 5 to
 20 10 15 years for a class "D" felony, and (3) life for a class "C"
 20 11 felony.
 20 12    ANIMAL RESCUE == LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICERS.  A law
 20 13 enforcement officer (e.g., county sheriff or deputy sheriff)
 20 14 is authorized to rescue an animal from a motor vehicle based
 20 15 upon the officer's reasonable belief that the animal may be
 20 16 suffering distress.  The officer must provide a written notice
 20 17 of the rescue.  After the rescue, the animal must be maintained
 20 18 as a rescued animal by the local authority until it is claimed
 20 19 or disposed of pursuant to court order.
 20 20    MANDATORY REPORTING == VETERINARIANS TO LOCAL LAW
 20 21 ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES.  A veterinarian is required to report
 20 22 cases in which an animal may have suffered a serious injury due
 20 23 to animal abuse, animal neglect, or animal torture.  The board
 20 24 of veterinary medicine may prescribe the form of the report.
 20 25 The report must be submitted to the local law enforcement
 20 26 agency  having jurisdiction of the matter.
 20 27    MANDATORY REPORTING == LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES TO THE
 20 28 DEPARTMENT OF HUMAN SERVICES.  A local law enforcement agency
 20 29 must submit a report to the department of human services if a
 20 30 law enforcement officer conducts an investigation involving
 20 31 animal abuse, animal neglect, or animal torture and reasonably
 20 32 believes a minor child of the subject of the investigation
 20 33 witnessed the offense being committed.
 20 34    STATE MANDATE.  The bill may include a state mandate as
 20 35 defined in Code section 25B.3.  The bill makes inapplicable
 21  1 Code section 25B.2, subsection 3, which would relieve a
 21  2 political subdivision from complying with a state mandate if
 21  3 funding for the cost of the state mandate is not provided or
 21  4 specified.  Therefore, political subdivisions are required to
 21  5 comply with any state mandate included in the bill.

 19 28 "C" felony, confinement for no more than 10 years and a fine of
 19 29 at least $1,000 but not more than $10,000.
 19 30    COURT ORDERS.  At the time of conviction for committing
 19 31 any of the offenses, a person may be subject to a court order
 19 32 requiring a psychological or psychiatric evaluation and
 19 33 treatment.  The person may also be subject to a court order
 19 34 prohibiting the person from owning, possessing, or living with
 19 35 an animal of the same genus as the mistreated animal.  In each
 20  1 case, the court's decision to issue an order is discretionary
 20  2 except under certain conditions.  A court order requiring an
 20  3 evaluation and treatment is mandatory for juveniles.  That
 20  4 order and the order prohibiting contact with animals is
 20  5 also mandatory if the offense is punishable as an aggravated
 20  6 misdemeanor or felony.  For a discretionary court order,
 20  7 the  period of prohibition is from one to five years.  For a
 20  8 mandatory court order, the period of prohibition is as follows:
 20  9 (1)  one to five years for an aggravated misdemeanor, (2) 5 to
 20 10 15 years for a class "D" felony, and (3) life for a class "C"
 20 11 felony.
 20 12    ANIMAL RESCUE == LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICERS.  A law
 20 13 enforcement officer (e.g., county sheriff or deputy sheriff)
 20 14 is authorized to rescue an animal from a motor vehicle based
 20 15 upon the officer's reasonable belief that the animal may be
 20 16 suffering distress.  The officer must provide a written notice
 20 17 of the rescue.  After the rescue, the animal must be maintained
 20 18 as a rescued animal by the local authority until it is claimed
 20 19 or disposed of pursuant to court order.
 20 20    MANDATORY REPORTING == VETERINARIANS TO LOCAL LAW
 20 21 ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES.  A veterinarian is required to report
 20 22 cases in which an animal may have suffered a serious injury due
 20 23 to animal abuse, animal neglect, or animal torture.  The board
 20 24 of veterinary medicine may prescribe the form of the report.
 20 25 The report must be submitted to the local law enforcement
 20 26 agency  having jurisdiction of the matter.
 20 27    MANDATORY REPORTING == LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES TO THE
 20 28 DEPARTMENT OF HUMAN SERVICES.  A local law enforcement agency
 20 29 must submit a report to the department of human services if a
 20 30 law enforcement officer conducts an investigation involving
 20 31 animal abuse, animal neglect, or animal torture and reasonably
 20 32 believes a minor child of the subject of the investigation
 20 33 witnessed the offense being committed.

 17 19 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
 17 20 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
 17 21    GENERAL.  This bill amends Code chapter 717B prohibiting
 17 22 the mistreatment of certain animals, including dogs and cats,
 17 23 but excluding other animals such as livestock (Code chapter
 17 24 717); game, fur=bearing animals, fish, reptiles, or amphibians
 17 25 (Code chapter 481A), unless such animal is owned, confined,
 17 26 or controlled by a person; or a nongame animal declared to be
 17 27 a nuisance by the natural resource commission (Code section
 17 28 481A.42).
 17 29    There are seven amended or new criminal offenses, including
 17 30 animal abuse in the first or second degree (amended Code
 17 31 section 717B.2 and new Code section 717B.2A), animal neglect
 17 32 in the first or second degree (new Code section 717B.2B
 17 33 and amended Code section 717B.3), animal torture (amended
 17 34 Code section 717B.3A), animal abandonment (new Code section
 17 35 717B.3B), and animal endangerment (new Code section 717B.3C).
 18  1  Each of the amended or new offenses includes an enhanced
 18  2 penalty that applies to a convicted person in either of two
 18  3 situations:  (1) the person is an adult who committed the
 18  4 offense in the presence of a juvenile or (2) the person has
 18  5 previously committed any of the offenses previously described;
 18  6 committed injury or interference with a police service dog
 18  7 (Code section 717B.9); committed bestiality (Code section
 18  8 717C.1); committed an offense involving animal fighting (Code
 18  9 section 717D.4); or committed any similar offense in another
 18 10 state.
 18 11    TYPES OF CRIMINAL OFFENSES == ABUSE, NEGLECT, OR TORTURE.
 18 12 Animal abuse involves injuring an animal by violence or
 18 13 poisoning; animal neglect involves failing to provide an animal
 18 14 with adequate food, water, habitable conditions, or necessary
 18 15 veterinary care; and animal torture involves inflicting upon
 18 16 the animal severe and prolonged or repeated physical pain.  For
 18 17 animal abuse in the first degree, animal neglect in the first
 18 18 degree, or animal torture, the animal must suffer a serious
 18 19 injury or death. Serious injury involves a substantial risk
 18 20 of death, protracted disfigurement, impairment, or a loss or
 18 21 impairment of a limb. For animal abuse in the second degree,
 18 22 the animal must suffer an injury meaning some impairment to the
 18 23 animal's health or functions, or death. For animal neglect in
 18 24 the second degree, the injury element is not required. For
 18 25 these offenses, the criminal penalties are as follows:  (1)
 18 26 animal abuse in the first degree, an aggravated misdemeanor
 18 27 which may be enhanced to a class "D" felony; (2) animal abuse
 18 28 in the second degree, a serious misdemeanor which may be
 18 29 enhanced to an aggravated misdemeanor; (3) animal neglect
 18 30 in the first degree, an aggravated misdemeanor which may be
 18 31 enhanced to a class "D" felony; (4)  animal neglect in the
 18 32 second degree, a serious misdemeanor which may be enhanced to
 18 33 an aggravated misdemeanor; and (5) animal torture, a class "D"
 18 34 felony which may be enhanced to a class "C" felony.
 18 35    A number of exceptions apply to the animal abuse and animal
 19  1 torture offenses, including carrying out (1) a court order; (2)
 19  2 a veterinary practice; (3) a good animal husbandry practice;
 19  3 (4) another provision of law; (5) legally hunting, trapping,
 19  4 or fishing; (6) a defense of property or life; (7) conduct
 19  5 by a local authority; and (8) research activities.  The bill
 19  6 eliminates a provision in the current abuse Code section that
 19  7 excepts an animal's owner from culpability.  The bill also
 19  8 eliminates an element of animal torture that requires proof of
 19  9 sadistic or depraved intent.
 19 10    TYPES OF CRIMINAL OFFENSES == ANIMAL ABANDONMENT AND ANIMAL
 19 11 ENDANGERMENT.  For animal abandonment, a person must knowingly
 19 12 or recklessly relinquish custody of an animal, and then fail
 19 13 to provide for its legal transfer or make arrangements for its
 19 14 care. For animal endangerment, a person must confine an animal
 19 15 in a stationary motor vehicle in a manner that endangers the
 19 16 health or life of the animal. For these last two offenses, the
 19 17 criminal penalties are the same: a simple misdemeanor which
 19 18 may be enhanced to a serious misdemeanor.
 19 19    APPLICABLE CRIMINAL PENALTIES.  The criminal penalties are
 19 20 as follows:  (1) simple misdemeanor,  confinement for no more
 19 21 than 30 days or a fine of at least $65 but not more than $625 or
 19 22 by both; (2)  serious misdemeanor, confinement for no more than
 19 23 one year and a fine of at least $315 but not more than $1,875;
 19 24 (3) aggravated misdemeanor, confinement for no more than two
 19 25 years and a fine of at least $625 but not more than $6,250; (4)
 19 26 class "D" felony, confinement for no more than five years and a
 19 27 fine of at least $750 but not more than $7,500; and (5) class
 19 28 "C" felony, confinement for no more than 10 years and a fine of
 19 29 at least $1,000 but not more than $10,000.
 19 30    COURT ORDERS.  At the time of conviction for committing
 19 31 any of the offenses, a person may be subject to a court order
 19 32 requiring a psychological or psychiatric evaluation and
 19 33 treatment.  The person may also be subject to a court order
 19 34 prohibiting the person from owning, possessing, or living with

 18 27 which may be enhanced to a class "D" felony; (2) animal abuse
 18 28 in the second degree, a serious misdemeanor which may be
 18 29 enhanced to an aggravated misdemeanor; (3) animal neglect
 18 30 in the first degree, an aggravated misdemeanor which may be
 18 31 enhanced to a class "D" felony; (4)  animal neglect in the
 18 32 second degree, a serious misdemeanor which may be enhanced to
 18 33 an aggravated misdemeanor; and (5) animal torture, a class "D"
 18 34 felony which may be enhanced to a class "C" felony.

 19  3 (4) another provision of law; (5) legally hunting, trapping,
 19  4 or fishing; (6) a defense of property or life; (7) conduct
 19  5 by a local authority; and (8) research activities.  The bill
 19  6 eliminates a provision in the current abuse Code section that
 19  7 excepts an animal's owner from culpability.  The bill also
 19  8 eliminates an element of animal torture that requires proof of
 19  9 sadistic or depraved intent.
 19 10    TYPES OF CRIMINAL OFFENSES == ANIMAL ABANDONMENT AND ANIMAL
 19 11 ENDANGERMENT.  For animal abandonment, a person must knowingly
 19 12 or recklessly relinquish custody of an animal, and then fail
 19 13 to provide for its legal transfer or make arrangements for its
 19 14 care. For animal endangerment, a person must confine an animal
 19 15 in a stationary motor vehicle in a manner that endangers the
 19 16 health or life of the animal. For these last two offenses, the
 19 17 criminal penalties are the same: a simple misdemeanor which
 19 18 may be enhanced to a serious misdemeanor.
 19 19    APPLICABLE CRIMINAL PENALTIES.  The criminal penalties are
 19 20 as follows:  (1) simple misdemeanor,  confinement for no more
 19 21 than 30 days or a fine of at least $65 but not more than $625 or
 19 22 by both; (2)  serious misdemeanor, confinement for no more than
 19 23 one year and a fine of at least $315 but not more than $1,875;
 19 24 (3) aggravated misdemeanor, confinement for no more than two

 19 28 "C" felony, confinement for no more than 10 years and a fine of
 19 29 at least $1,000 but not more than $10,000.
 19 30    COURT ORDERS.  At the time of conviction for committing
 19 31 any of the offenses, a person may be subject to a court order
 19 32 requiring a psychological or psychiatric evaluation and
 19 33 treatment.  The person may also be subject to a court order
 19 34 prohibiting the person from owning, possessing, or living with
 19 35 an animal of the same genus as the mistreated animal.  In each
 20  1 case, the court's decision to issue an order is discretionary
 20  2 except under certain conditions.  A court order requiring an
 20  3 evaluation and treatment is mandatory for juveniles.  That
 20  4 order and the order prohibiting contact with animals is
 20  5 also mandatory if the offense is punishable as an aggravated
 20  6 misdemeanor or felony.  For a discretionary court order,
 20  7 the  period of prohibition is from one to five years.  For a
 20  8 mandatory court order, the period of prohibition is as follows:
 20  9 (1)  one to five years for an aggravated misdemeanor, (2) 5 to
 20 10 15 years for a class "D" felony, and (3) life for a class "C"
 20 11 felony.
 20 12    ANIMAL RESCUE == LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICERS.  A law
 20 13 enforcement officer (e.g., county sheriff or deputy sheriff)
 20 14 is authorized to rescue an animal from a motor vehicle based
 20 15 upon the officer's reasonable belief that the animal may be
 20 16 suffering distress.  The officer must provide a written notice
 20 17 of the rescue.  After the rescue, the animal must be maintained
 20 18 as a rescued animal by the local authority until it is claimed
 20 19 or disposed of pursuant to court order.
 20 20    MANDATORY REPORTING == VETERINARIANS TO LOCAL LAW
 20 21 ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES.  A veterinarian is required to report
 20 22 cases in which an animal may have suffered a serious injury due
 20 23 to animal abuse, animal neglect, or animal torture.  The board
 20 24 of veterinary medicine may prescribe the form of the report.
 20 25 The report must be submitted to the local law enforcement
 20 26 agency  having jurisdiction of the matter.
 20 27    MANDATORY REPORTING == LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES TO THE
 20 28 DEPARTMENT OF HUMAN SERVICES.  A local law enforcement agency
 20 29 must submit a report to the department of human services if a
 20 30 law enforcement officer conducts an investigation involving
 20 31 animal abuse, animal neglect, or animal torture and reasonably
 20 32 believes a minor child of the subject of the investigation
 20 33 witnessed the offense being committed.
 20 34    STATE MANDATE.  The bill may include a state mandate as
 20 35 defined in Code section 25B.3.  The bill makes inapplicable
 21  1 Code section 25B.2, subsection 3, which would relieve a
 21  2 political subdivision from complying with a state mandate if
 21  3 funding for the cost of the state mandate is not provided or
 21  4 specified.  Therefore, political subdivisions are required to
 21  5 comply with any state mandate included in the bill.

 17 19 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
 17 20 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
 17 21    GENERAL.  This bill amends Code chapter 717B prohibiting
 17 22 the mistreatment of certain animals, including dogs and cats,
 17 23 but excluding other animals such as livestock (Code chapter
 17 24 717); game, fur=bearing animals, fish, reptiles, or amphibians
 17 25 (Code chapter 481A), unless such animal is owned, confined,
 17 26 or controlled by a person; or a nongame animal declared to be
 17 27 a nuisance by the natural resource commission (Code section
 17 28 481A.42).
 17 29    There are seven amended or new criminal offenses, including
 17 30 animal abuse in the first or second degree (amended Code
 17 31 section 717B.2 and new Code section 717B.2A), animal neglect
 17 32 in the first or second degree (new Code section 717B.2B
 17 33 and amended Code section 717B.3), animal torture (amended
 17 34 Code section 717B.3A), animal abandonment (new Code section
 17 35 717B.3B), and animal endangerment (new Code section 717B.3C).
 18  1  Each of the amended or new offenses includes an enhanced
 18  2 penalty that applies to a convicted person in either of two
 18  3 situations:  (1) the person is an adult who committed the
 18  4 offense in the presence of a juvenile or (2) the person has
 18  5 previously committed any of the offenses previously described;
 18  6 committed injury or interference with a police service dog
 18  7 (Code section 717B.9); committed bestiality (Code section
 18  8 717C.1); committed an offense involving animal fighting (Code
 18  9 section 717D.4); or committed any similar offense in another
 18 10 state.
 18 11    TYPES OF CRIMINAL OFFENSES == ABUSE, NEGLECT, OR TORTURE.
 18 12 Animal abuse involves injuring an animal by violence or
 18 13 poisoning; animal neglect involves failing to provide an animal
 18 14 with adequate food, water, habitable conditions, or necessary
 18 15 veterinary care; and animal torture involves inflicting upon
 18 16 the animal severe and prolonged or repeated physical pain.  For
 18 17 animal abuse in the first degree, animal neglect in the first
 18 18 degree, or animal torture, the animal must suffer a serious
 18 19 injury or death. Serious injury involves a substantial risk
 18 20 of death, protracted disfigurement, impairment, or a loss or
 18 21 impairment of a limb. For animal abuse in the second degree,
 18 22 the animal must suffer an injury meaning some impairment to the
 18 23 animal's health or functions, or death. For animal neglect in
 18 24 the second degree, the injury element is not required. For
 18 25 these offenses, the criminal penalties are as follows:  (1)
 18 26 animal abuse in the first degree, an aggravated misdemeanor
 18 27 which may be enhanced to a class "D" felony; (2) animal abuse
 18 28 in the second degree, a serious misdemeanor which may be
 18 29 enhanced to an aggravated misdemeanor; (3) animal neglect
 18 30 in the first degree, an aggravated misdemeanor which may be
 18 31 enhanced to a class "D" felony; (4)  animal neglect in the
 18 32 second degree, a serious misdemeanor which may be enhanced to
 18 33 an aggravated misdemeanor; and (5) animal torture, a class "D"
 18 34 felony which may be enhanced to a class "C" felony.
 18 35    A number of exceptions apply to the animal abuse and animal
 19  1 torture offenses, including carrying out (1) a court order; (2)
 19  2 a veterinary practice; (3) a good animal husbandry practice;
 19  3 (4) another provision of law; (5) legally hunting, trapping,
 19  4 or fishing; (6) a defense of property or life; (7) conduct
 19  5 by a local authority; and (8) research activities.  The bill
 19  6 eliminates a provision in the current abuse Code section that

 19 23 one year and a fine of at least $315 but not more than $1,875;
 19 24 (3) aggravated misdemeanor, confinement for no more than two
 19 25 years and a fine of at least $625 but not more than $6,250; (4)
 19 26 class "D" felony, confinement for no more than five years and a
 19 27 fine of at least $750 but not more than $7,500; and (5) class
 19 28 "C" felony, confinement for no more than 10 years and a fine of

 17 32 in the first or second degree (new Code section 717B.2B
 17 33 and amended Code section 717B.3), animal torture (amended
 17 34 Code section 717B.3A), animal abandonment (new Code section
 17 35 717B.3B), and animal endangerment (new Code section 717B.3C).
 18  1  Each of the amended or new offenses includes an enhanced
 18  2 penalty that applies to a convicted person in either of two
 18  3 situations:  (1) the person is an adult who committed the
 18  4 offense in the presence of a juvenile or (2) the person has
 18  5 previously committed any of the offenses previously described;
 18  6 committed injury or interference with a police service dog
 18  7 (Code section 717B.9); committed bestiality (Code section
 18  8 717C.1); committed an offense involving animal fighting (Code
 18  9 section 717D.4); or committed any similar offense in another
 18 10 state.
 18 11    TYPES OF CRIMINAL OFFENSES == ABUSE, NEGLECT, OR TORTURE.
 18 12 Animal abuse involves injuring an animal by violence or
 18 13 poisoning; animal neglect involves failing to provide an animal
 18 14 with adequate food, water, habitable conditions, or necessary
 18 15 veterinary care; and animal torture involves inflicting upon
 18 16 the animal severe and prolonged or repeated physical pain.  For
 18 17 animal abuse in the first degree, animal neglect in the first
 18 18 degree, or animal torture, the animal must suffer a serious
 18 19 injury or death. Serious injury involves a substantial risk
 18 20 of death, protracted disfigurement, impairment, or a loss or
 18 21 impairment of a limb. For animal abuse in the second degree,
 18 22 the animal must suffer an injury meaning some impairment to the
 18 23 animal's health or functions, or death. For animal neglect in
 18 24 the second degree, the injury element is not required. For
 18 25 these offenses, the criminal penalties are as follows:  (1)
 18 26 animal abuse in the first degree, an aggravated misdemeanor
 18 27 which may be enhanced to a class "D" felony; (2) animal abuse
 18 28 in the second degree, a serious misdemeanor which may be
 18 29 enhanced to an aggravated misdemeanor; (3) animal neglect
 18 30 in the first degree, an aggravated misdemeanor which may be
 18 31 enhanced to a class "D" felony; (4)  animal neglect in the
 18 32 second degree, a serious misdemeanor which may be enhanced to
 18 33 an aggravated misdemeanor; and (5) animal torture, a class "D"
 18 34 felony which may be enhanced to a class "C" felony.
 18 35    A number of exceptions apply to the animal abuse and animal
 19  1 torture offenses, including carrying out (1) a court order; (2)
 19  2 a veterinary practice; (3) a good animal husbandry practice;
 19  3 (4) another provision of law; (5) legally hunting, trapping,
 19  4 or fishing; (6) a defense of property or life; (7) conduct
 19  5 by a local authority; and (8) research activities.  The bill
 19  6 eliminates a provision in the current abuse Code section that
 19  7 excepts an animal's owner from culpability.  The bill also
 19  8 eliminates an element of animal torture that requires proof of
 19  9 sadistic or depraved intent.
 19 10    TYPES OF CRIMINAL OFFENSES == ANIMAL ABANDONMENT AND ANIMAL
 19 11 ENDANGERMENT.  For animal abandonment, a person must knowingly
 19 12 or recklessly relinquish custody of an animal, and then fail
 19 13 to provide for its legal transfer or make arrangements for its
 19 14 care. For animal endangerment, a person must confine an animal
 19 15 in a stationary motor vehicle in a manner that endangers the
 19 16 health or life of the animal. For these last two offenses, the
 19 17 criminal penalties are the same: a simple misdemeanor which
 19 18 may be enhanced to a serious misdemeanor.
 19 19    APPLICABLE CRIMINAL PENALTIES.  The criminal penalties are
 19 20 as follows:  (1) simple misdemeanor,  confinement for no more
 19 21 than 30 days or a fine of at least $65 but not more than $625 or
 19 22 by both; (2)  serious misdemeanor, confinement for no more than
 19 23 one year and a fine of at least $315 but not more than $1,875;
 19 24 (3) aggravated misdemeanor, confinement for no more than two
 19 25 years and a fine of at least $625 but not more than $6,250; (4)
 19 26 class "D" felony, confinement for no more than five years and a
 19 27 fine of at least $750 but not more than $7,500; and (5) class
 19 28 "C" felony, confinement for no more than 10 years and a fine of
 19 29 at least $1,000 but not more than $10,000.
 19 30    COURT ORDERS.  At the time of conviction for committing
 19 31 any of the offenses, a person may be subject to a court order
 19 32 requiring a psychological or psychiatric evaluation and
 19 33 treatment.  The person may also be subject to a court order
 19 34 prohibiting the person from owning, possessing, or living with
 19 35 an animal of the same genus as the mistreated animal.  In each
 20  1 case, the court's decision to issue an order is discretionary
 20  2 except under certain conditions.  A court order requiring an
 20  3 evaluation and treatment is mandatory for juveniles.  That
 20  4 order and the order prohibiting contact with animals is
 20  5 also mandatory if the offense is punishable as an aggravated
 20  6 misdemeanor or felony.  For a discretionary court order,
 20  7 the  period of prohibition is from one to five years.  For a
 20  8 mandatory court order, the period of prohibition is as follows:
 20  9 (1)  one to five years for an aggravated misdemeanor, (2) 5 to
 20 10 15 years for a class "D" felony, and (3) life for a class "C"
 20 11 felony.
 20 12    ANIMAL RESCUE == LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICERS.  A law
 20 13 enforcement officer (e.g., county sheriff or deputy sheriff)
 20 14 is authorized to rescue an animal from a motor vehicle based
 20 15 upon the officer's reasonable belief that the animal may be
 20 16 suffering distress.  The officer must provide a written notice
 20 17 of the rescue.  After the rescue, the animal must be maintained
 20 18 as a rescued animal by the local authority until it is claimed
 20 19 or disposed of pursuant to court order.
 20 20    MANDATORY REPORTING == VETERINARIANS TO LOCAL LAW
 20 21 ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES.  A veterinarian is required to report
 20 22 cases in which an animal may have suffered a serious injury due
 20 23 to animal abuse, animal neglect, or animal torture.  The board
 20 24 of veterinary medicine may prescribe the form of the report.
 20 25 The report must be submitted to the local law enforcement
 20 26 agency  having jurisdiction of the matter.
 20 27    MANDATORY REPORTING == LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES TO THE
 20 28 DEPARTMENT OF HUMAN SERVICES.  A local law enforcement agency
 20 29 must submit a report to the department of human services if a
 20 30 law enforcement officer conducts an investigation involving
 20 31 animal abuse, animal neglect, or animal torture and reasonably
 20 32 believes a minor child of the subject of the investigation
 20 33 witnessed the offense being committed.
 20 34    STATE MANDATE.  The bill may include a state mandate as
 20 35 defined in Code section 25B.3.  The bill makes inapplicable
 21  1 Code section 25B.2, subsection 3, which would relieve a
 21  2 political subdivision from complying with a state mandate if
 21  3 funding for the cost of the state mandate is not provided or
 21  4 specified.  Therefore, political subdivisions are required to
 21  5 comply with any state mandate included in the bill.

 17 19 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
 17 20 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
 17 21    GENERAL.  This bill amends Code chapter 717B prohibiting
 17 22 the mistreatment of certain animals, including dogs and cats,
 17 23 but excluding other animals such as livestock (Code chapter
 17 24 717); game, fur=bearing animals, fish, reptiles, or amphibians
 17 25 (Code chapter 481A), unless such animal is owned, confined,
 17 26 or controlled by a person; or a nongame animal declared to be
 17 27 a nuisance by the natural resource commission (Code section
 17 28 481A.42).
 17 29    There are seven amended or new criminal offenses, including
 17 30 animal abuse in the first or second degree (amended Code
 17 31 section 717B.2 and new Code section 717B.2A), animal neglect
 17 32 in the first or second degree (new Code section 717B.2B
 17 33 and amended Code section 717B.3), animal torture (amended
 17 34 Code section 717B.3A), animal abandonment (new Code section
 17 35 717B.3B), and animal endangerment (new Code section 717B.3C).
 18  1  Each of the amended or new offenses includes an enhanced
 18  2 penalty that applies to a convicted person in either of two
 18  3 situations:  (1) the person is an adult who committed the
 18  4 offense in the presence of a juvenile or (2) the person has
 18  5 previously committed any of the offenses previously described;
 18  6 committed injury or interference with a police service dog
 18  7 (Code section 717B.9); committed bestiality (Code section
 18  8 717C.1); committed an offense involving animal fighting (Code
 18  9 section 717D.4); or committed any similar offense in another
 18 10 state.
 18 11    TYPES OF CRIMINAL OFFENSES == ABUSE, NEGLECT, OR TORTURE.
 18 12 Animal abuse involves injuring an animal by violence or
 18 13 poisoning; animal neglect involves failing to provide an animal
 18 14 with adequate food, water, habitable conditions, or necessary
 18 15 veterinary care; and animal torture involves inflicting upon
 18 16 the animal severe and prolonged or repeated physical pain.  For
 18 17 animal abuse in the first degree, animal neglect in the first
 18 18 degree, or animal torture, the animal must suffer a serious
 18 19 injury or death. Serious injury involves a substantial risk
 18 20 of death, protracted disfigurement, impairment, or a loss or
 18 21 impairment of a limb. For animal abuse in the second degree,
 18 22 the animal must suffer an injury meaning some impairment to the
 18 23 animal's health or functions, or death. For animal neglect in
 18 24 the second degree, the injury element is not required. For
 18 25 these offenses, the criminal penalties are as follows:  (1)
 18 26 animal abuse in the first degree, an aggravated misdemeanor
 18 27 which may be enhanced to a class "D" felony; (2) animal abuse
 18 28 in the second degree, a serious misdemeanor which may be
 18 29 enhanced to an aggravated misdemeanor; (3) animal neglect
 18 30 in the first degree, an aggravated misdemeanor which may be
 18 31 enhanced to a class "D" felony; (4)  animal neglect in the
 18 32 second degree, a serious misdemeanor which may be enhanced to
 18 33 an aggravated misdemeanor; and (5) animal torture, a class "D"
 18 34 felony which may be enhanced to a class "C" felony.
 18 35    A number of exceptions apply to the animal abuse and animal
 19  1 torture offenses, including carrying out (1) a court order; (2)
 19  2 a veterinary practice; (3) a good animal husbandry practice;
 19  3 (4) another provision of law; (5) legally hunting, trapping,
 19  4 or fishing; (6) a defense of property or life; (7) conduct
 19  5 by a local authority; and (8) research activities.  The bill
 19  6 eliminates a provision in the current abuse Code section that
 19  7 excepts an animal's owner from culpability.  The bill also
 19  8 eliminates an element of animal torture that requires proof of
 19  9 sadistic or depraved intent.
 19 10    TYPES OF CRIMINAL OFFENSES == ANIMAL ABANDONMENT AND ANIMAL
 19 11 ENDANGERMENT.  For animal abandonment, a person must knowingly
 19 12 or recklessly relinquish custody of an animal, and then fail
 19 13 to provide for its legal transfer or make arrangements for its
 19 14 care. For animal endangerment, a person must confine an animal
 19 15 in a stationary motor vehicle in a manner that endangers the
 19 16 health or life of the animal. For these last two offenses, the
 19 17 criminal penalties are the same: a simple misdemeanor which
 19 18 may be enhanced to a serious misdemeanor.
 19 19    APPLICABLE CRIMINAL PENALTIES.  The criminal penalties are
 19 20 as follows:  (1) simple misdemeanor,  confinement for no more
 19 21 than 30 days or a fine of at least $65 but not more than $625 or
 19 22 by both; (2)  serious misdemeanor, confinement for no more than
 19 23 one year and a fine of at least $315 but not more than $1,875;
 19 24 (3) aggravated misdemeanor, confinement for no more than two
 19 25 years and a fine of at least $625 but not more than $6,250; (4)
 19 26 class "D" felony, confinement for no more than five years and a
 19 27 fine of at least $750 but not more than $7,500; and (5) class
 19 28 "C" felony, confinement for no more than 10 years and a fine of
 19 29 at least $1,000 but not more than $10,000.
 19 30    COURT ORDERS.  At the time of conviction for committing
 19 31 any of the offenses, a person may be subject to a court order
 19 32 requiring a psychological or psychiatric evaluation and
 19 33 treatment.  The person may also be subject to a court order
 19 34 prohibiting the person from owning, possessing, or living with
 19 35 an animal of the same genus as the mistreated animal.  In each
 20  1 case, the court's decision to issue an order is discretionary
 20  2 except under certain conditions.  A court order requiring an
 20  3 evaluation and treatment is mandatory for juveniles.  That
 20  4 order and the order prohibiting contact with animals is
 20  5 also mandatory if the offense is punishable as an aggravated
 20  6 misdemeanor or felony.  For a discretionary court order,
 20  7 the  period of prohibition is from one to five years.  For a
 20  8 mandatory court order, the period of prohibition is as follows:
 20  9 (1)  one to five years for an aggravated misdemeanor, (2) 5 to
 20 10 15 years for a class "D" felony, and (3) life for a class "C"
 20 11 felony.
 20 12    ANIMAL RESCUE == LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICERS.  A law
 20 13 enforcement officer (e.g., county sheriff or deputy sheriff)
 20 14 is authorized to rescue an animal from a motor vehicle based
 20 15 upon the officer's reasonable belief that the animal may be
 20 16 suffering distress.  The officer must provide a written notice
 20 17 of the rescue.  After the rescue, the animal must be maintained
 20 18 as a rescued animal by the local authority until it is claimed
 20 19 or disposed of pursuant to court order.
 20 20    MANDATORY REPORTING == VETERINARIANS TO LOCAL LAW
 20 21 ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES.  A veterinarian is required to report
 20 22 cases in which an animal may have suffered a serious injury due
 20 23 to animal abuse, animal neglect, or animal torture.  The board
 20 24 of veterinary medicine may prescribe the form of the report.
 20 25 The report must be submitted to the local law enforcement
 20 26 agency  having jurisdiction of the matter.
 20 27    MANDATORY REPORTING == LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES TO THE
 20 28 DEPARTMENT OF HUMAN SERVICES.  A local law enforcement agency
 20 29 must submit a report to the department of human services if a
 20 30 law enforcement officer conducts an investigation involving
 20 31 animal abuse, animal neglect, or animal torture and reasonably
 20 32 believes a minor child of the subject of the investigation
 20 33 witnessed the offense being committed.
 20 34    STATE MANDATE.  The bill may include a state mandate as
 20 35 defined in Code section 25B.3.  The bill makes inapplicable
 21  1 Code section 25B.2, subsection 3, which would relieve a
 21  2 political subdivision from complying with a state mandate if
 21  3 funding for the cost of the state mandate is not provided or
 21  4 specified.  Therefore, political subdivisions are required to
 21  5 comply with any state mandate included in the bill.

 20 27    MANDATORY REPORTING == LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES TO THE
 20 28 DEPARTMENT OF HUMAN SERVICES.  A local law enforcement agency
 20 29 must submit a report to the department of human services if a
 20 30 law enforcement officer conducts an investigation involving
 20 31 animal abuse, animal neglect, or animal torture and reasonably
 20 32 believes a minor child of the subject of the investigation
 20 33 witnessed the offense being committed.
 20 34    STATE MANDATE.  The bill may include a state mandate as
 20 35 defined in Code section 25B.3.  The bill makes inapplicable

 21  3 funding for the cost of the state mandate is not provided or
 21  4 specified.  Therefore, political subdivisions are required to
 21  5 comply with any state mandate included in the bill.

 17 19 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
 17 20 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
 17 21    GENERAL.  This bill amends Code chapter 717B prohibiting
 17 22 the mistreatment of certain animals, including dogs and cats,
 17 23 but excluding other animals such as livestock (Code chapter
 17 24 717); game, fur=bearing animals, fish, reptiles, or amphibians
 17 25 (Code chapter 481A), unless such animal is owned, confined,
 17 26 or controlled by a person; or a nongame animal declared to be
 17 27 a nuisance by the natural resource commission (Code section
 17 28 481A.42).
 17 29    There are seven amended or new criminal offenses, including
 17 30 animal abuse in the first or second degree (amended Code
 17 31 section 717B.2 and new Code section 717B.2A), animal neglect
 17 32 in the first or second degree (new Code section 717B.2B
 17 33 and amended Code section 717B.3), animal torture (amended
 17 34 Code section 717B.3A), animal abandonment (new Code section
 17 35 717B.3B), and animal endangerment (new Code section 717B.3C).
 18  1  Each of the amended or new offenses includes an enhanced
 18  2 penalty that applies to a convicted person in either of two
 18  3 situations:  (1) the person is an adult who committed the
 18  4 offense in the presence of a juvenile or (2) the person has
 18  5 previously committed any of the offenses previously described;
 18  6 committed injury or interference with a police service dog
 18  7 (Code section 717B.9); committed bestiality (Code section
 18  8 717C.1); committed an offense involving animal fighting (Code
 18  9 section 717D.4); or committed any similar offense in another
 18 10 state.
 18 11    TYPES OF CRIMINAL OFFENSES == ABUSE, NEGLECT, OR TORTURE.
 18 12 Animal abuse involves injuring an animal by violence or
 18 13 poisoning; animal neglect involves failing to provide an animal
 18 14 with adequate food, water, habitable conditions, or necessary
 18 15 veterinary care; and animal torture involves inflicting upon
 18 16 the animal severe and prolonged or repeated physical pain.  For
 18 17 animal abuse in the first degree, animal neglect in the first
 18 18 degree, or animal torture, the animal must suffer a serious
 18 19 injury or death. Serious injury involves a substantial risk
 18 20 of death, protracted disfigurement, impairment, or a loss or
 18 21 impairment of a limb. For animal abuse in the second degree,
 18 22 the animal must suffer an injury meaning some impairment to the
 18 23 animal's health or functions, or death. For animal neglect in
 18 24 the second degree, the injury element is not required. For
 18 25 these offenses, the criminal penalties are as follows:  (1)
 18 26 animal abuse in the first degree, an aggravated misdemeanor
 18 27 which may be enhanced to a class "D" felony; (2) animal abuse
 18 28 in the second degree, a serious misdemeanor which may be
 18 29 enhanced to an aggravated misdemeanor; (3) animal neglect
 18 30 in the first degree, an aggravated misdemeanor which may be
 18 31 enhanced to a class "D" felony; (4)  animal neglect in the
 18 32 second degree, a serious misdemeanor which may be enhanced to
 18 33 an aggravated misdemeanor; and (5) animal torture, a class "D"
 18 34 felony which may be enhanced to a class "C" felony.
 18 35    A number of exceptions apply to the animal abuse and animal
 19  1 torture offenses, including carrying out (1) a court order; (2)
 19  2 a veterinary practice; (3) a good animal husbandry practice;
 19  3 (4) another provision of law; (5) legally hunting, trapping,
 19  4 or fishing; (6) a defense of property or life; (7) conduct
 19  5 by a local authority; and (8) research activities.  The bill
 19  6 eliminates a provision in the current abuse Code section that
 19  7 excepts an animal's owner from culpability.  The bill also
 19  8 eliminates an element of animal torture that requires proof of
 19  9 sadistic or depraved intent.
 19 10    TYPES OF CRIMINAL OFFENSES == ANIMAL ABANDONMENT AND ANIMAL
 19 11 ENDANGERMENT.  For animal abandonment, a person must knowingly
 19 12 or recklessly relinquish custody of an animal, and then fail
 19 13 to provide for its legal transfer or make arrangements for its
 19 14 care. For animal endangerment, a person must confine an animal
 19 15 in a stationary motor vehicle in a manner that endangers the
 19 16 health or life of the animal. For these last two offenses, the
 19 17 criminal penalties are the same: a simple misdemeanor which
 19 18 may be enhanced to a serious misdemeanor.
 19 19    APPLICABLE CRIMINAL PENALTIES.  The criminal penalties are
 19 20 as follows:  (1) simple misdemeanor,  confinement for no more
 19 21 than 30 days or a fine of at least $65 but not more than $625 or
 19 22 by both; (2)  serious misdemeanor, confinement for no more than
 19 23 one year and a fine of at least $315 but not more than $1,875;
 19 24 (3) aggravated misdemeanor, confinement for no more than two
 19 25 years and a fine of at least $625 but not more than $6,250; (4)
 19 26 class "D" felony, confinement for no more than five years and a
 19 27 fine of at least $750 but not more than $7,500; and (5) class
 19 28 "C" felony, confinement for no more than 10 years and a fine of
 19 29 at least $1,000 but not more than $10,000.
 19 30    COURT ORDERS.  At the time of conviction for committing
 19 31 any of the offenses, a person may be subject to a court order
 19 32 requiring a psychological or psychiatric evaluation and
 19 33 treatment.  The person may also be subject to a court order
 19 34 prohibiting the person from owning, possessing, or living with
 19 35 an animal of the same genus as the mistreated animal.  In each
 20  1 case, the court's decision to issue an order is discretionary
 20  2 except under certain conditions.  A court order requiring an
 20  3 evaluation and treatment is mandatory for juveniles.  That
 20  4 order and the order prohibiting contact with animals is
 20  5 also mandatory if the offense is punishable as an aggravated
 20  6 misdemeanor or felony.  For a discretionary court order,
 20  7 the  period of prohibition is from one to five years.  For a
 20  8 mandatory court order, the period of prohibition is as follows:
 20  9 (1)  one to five years for an aggravated misdemeanor, (2) 5 to
 20 10 15 years for a class "D" felony, and (3) life for a class "C"
 20 11 felony.
 20 12    ANIMAL RESCUE == LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICERS.  A law
 20 13 enforcement officer (e.g., county sheriff or deputy sheriff)
 20 14 is authorized to rescue an animal from a motor vehicle based
 20 15 upon the officer's reasonable belief that the animal may be
 20 16 suffering distress.  The officer must provide a written notice
 20 17 of the rescue.  After the rescue, the animal must be maintained
 20 18 as a rescued animal by the local authority until it is claimed
 20 19 or disposed of pursuant to court order.
 20 20    MANDATORY REPORTING == VETERINARIANS TO LOCAL LAW
 20 21 ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES.  A veterinarian is required to report
 20 22 cases in which an animal may have suffered a serious injury due
 20 23 to animal abuse, animal neglect, or animal torture.  The board
 20 24 of veterinary medicine may prescribe the form of the report.
 20 25 The report must be submitted to the local law enforcement
 20 26 agency  having jurisdiction of the matter.
 20 27    MANDATORY REPORTING == LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES TO THE
 20 28 DEPARTMENT OF HUMAN SERVICES.  A local law enforcement agency
 20 29 must submit a report to the department of human services if a
 20 30 law enforcement officer conducts an investigation involving
 20 31 animal abuse, animal neglect, or animal torture and reasonably
 20 32 believes a minor child of the subject of the investigation
 20 33 witnessed the offense being committed.
 20 34    STATE MANDATE.  The bill may include a state mandate as
 20 35 defined in Code section 25B.3.  The bill makes inapplicable
 21  1 Code section 25B.2, subsection 3, which would relieve a
 21  2 political subdivision from complying with a state mandate if
 21  3 funding for the cost of the state mandate is not provided or
 21  4 specified.  Therefore, political subdivisions are required to
 21  5 comply with any state mandate included in the bill.

 20 25 The report must be submitted to the local law enforcement
 20 26 agency  having jurisdiction of the matter.
 20 27    MANDATORY REPORTING == LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES TO THE
 20 28 DEPARTMENT OF HUMAN SERVICES.  A local law enforcement agency
 20 29 must submit a report to the department of human services if a
 20 30 law enforcement officer conducts an investigation involving
 20 31 animal abuse, animal neglect, or animal torture and reasonably
 20 32 believes a minor child of the subject of the investigation
 20 33 witnessed the offense being committed.
 20 34    STATE MANDATE.  The bill may include a state mandate as
 20 35 defined in Code section 25B.3.  The bill makes inapplicable
 21  1 Code section 25B.2, subsection 3, which would relieve a
 21  2 political subdivision from complying with a state mandate if
 21  3 funding for the cost of the state mandate is not provided or
 21  4 specified.  Therefore, political subdivisions are required to
 21  5 comply with any state mandate included in the bill.

 17 21    GENERAL.  This bill amends Code chapter 717B prohibiting
 17 22 the mistreatment of certain animals, including dogs and cats,
 17 23 but excluding other animals such as livestock (Code chapter
 17 24 717); game, fur=bearing animals, fish, reptiles, or amphibians
 17 25 (Code chapter 481A), unless such animal is owned, confined,
 17 26 or controlled by a person; or a nongame animal declared to be
 17 27 a nuisance by the natural resource commission (Code section
 17 28 481A.42).
 17 29    There are seven amended or new criminal offenses, including
 17 30 animal abuse in the first or second degree (amended Code
 17 31 section 717B.2 and new Code section 717B.2A), animal neglect
 17 32 in the first or second degree (new Code section 717B.2B
 17 33 and amended Code section 717B.3), animal torture (amended
 17 34 Code section 717B.3A), animal abandonment (new Code section
 17 35 717B.3B), and animal endangerment (new Code section 717B.3C).
 18  1  Each of the amended or new offenses includes an enhanced
 18  2 penalty that applies to a convicted person in either of two
 18  3 situations:  (1) the person is an adult who committed the
 18  4 offense in the presence of a juvenile or (2) the person has
 18  5 previously committed any of the offenses previously described;
 18  6 committed injury or interference with a police service dog
 18  7 (Code section 717B.9); committed bestiality (Code section
 18  8 717C.1); committed an offense involving animal fighting (Code
 18  9 section 717D.4); or committed any similar offense in another
 18 10 state.
 18 11    TYPES OF CRIMINAL OFFENSES == ABUSE, NEGLECT, OR TORTURE.
 18 12 Animal abuse involves injuring an animal by violence or
 18 13 poisoning; animal neglect involves failing to provide an animal
 18 14 with adequate food, water, habitable conditions, or necessary
 18 15 veterinary care; and animal torture involves inflicting upon
 18 16 the animal severe and prolonged or repeated physical pain.  For
 18 17 animal abuse in the first degree, animal neglect in the first
 18 18 degree, or animal torture, the animal must suffer a serious
 18 19 injury or death. Serious injury involves a substantial risk
 18 20 of death, protracted disfigurement, impairment, or a loss or
 18 21 impairment of a limb. For animal abuse in the second degree,
 18 22 the animal must suffer an injury meaning some impairment to the
 18 23 animal's health or functions, or death. For animal neglect in
 18 24 the second degree, the injury element is not required. For
 18 25 these offenses, the criminal penalties are as follows:  (1)
 18 26 animal abuse in the first degree, an aggravated misdemeanor
 18 27 which may be enhanced to a class "D" felony; (2) animal abuse
 18 28 in the second degree, a serious misdemeanor which may be
 18 29 enhanced to an aggravated misdemeanor; (3) animal neglect
 18 30 in the first degree, an aggravated misdemeanor which may be
 18 31 enhanced to a class "D" felony; (4)  animal neglect in the
 18 32 second degree, a serious misdemeanor which may be enhanced to
 18 33 an aggravated misdemeanor; and (5) animal torture, a class "D"
 18 34 felony which may be enhanced to a class "C" felony.
 18 35    A number of exceptions apply to the animal abuse and animal
 19  1 torture offenses, including carrying out (1) a court order; (2)
 19  2 a veterinary practice; (3) a good animal husbandry practice;
 19  3 (4) another provision of law; (5) legally hunting, trapping,
 19  4 or fishing; (6) a defense of property or life; (7) conduct
 19  5 by a local authority; and (8) research activities.  The bill
 19  6 eliminates a provision in the current abuse Code section that
 19  7 excepts an animal's owner from culpability.  The bill also
 19  8 eliminates an element of animal torture that requires proof of
 19  9 sadistic or depraved intent.
 19 10    TYPES OF CRIMINAL OFFENSES == ANIMAL ABANDONMENT AND ANIMAL
 19 11 ENDANGERMENT.  For animal abandonment, a person must knowingly
 19 12 or recklessly relinquish custody of an animal, and then fail
 19 13 to provide for its legal transfer or make arrangements for its
 19 14 care. For animal endangerment, a person must confine an animal
 19 15 in a stationary motor vehicle in a manner that endangers the
 19 16 health or life of the animal. For these last two offenses, the
 19 17 criminal penalties are the same: a simple misdemeanor which
 19 18 may be enhanced to a serious misdemeanor.
 19 19    APPLICABLE CRIMINAL PENALTIES.  The criminal penalties are
 19 20 as follows:  (1) simple misdemeanor,  confinement for no more
 19 21 than 30 days or a fine of at least $65 but not more than $625 or
 19 22 by both; (2)  serious misdemeanor, confinement for no more than
 19 23 one year and a fine of at least $315 but not more than $1,875;
 19 24 (3) aggravated misdemeanor, confinement for no more than two
 19 25 years and a fine of at least $625 but not more than $6,250; (4)
 19 26 class "D" felony, confinement for no more than five years and a
 19 27 fine of at least $750 but not more than $7,500; and (5) class
 19 28 "C" felony, confinement for no more than 10 years and a fine of
 19 29 at least $1,000 but not more than $10,000.
 19 30    COURT ORDERS.  At the time of conviction for committing
 19 31 any of the offenses, a person may be subject to a court order
 19 32 requiring a psychological or psychiatric evaluation and
 19 33 treatment.  The person may also be subject to a court order
 19 34 prohibiting the person from owning, possessing, or living with
 19 35 an animal of the same genus as the mistreated animal.  In each
 20  1 case, the court's decision to issue an order is discretionary
 20  2 except under certain conditions.  A court order requiring an
 20  3 evaluation and treatment is mandatory for juveniles.  That
 20  4 order and the order prohibiting contact with animals is
 20  5 also mandatory if the offense is punishable as an aggravated
 20  6 misdemeanor or felony.  For a discretionary court order,
 20  7 the  period of prohibition is from one to five years.  For a
 20  8 mandatory court order, the period of prohibition is as follows:
 20  9 (1)  one to five years for an aggravated misdemeanor, (2) 5 to
 20 10 15 years for a class "D" felony, and (3) life for a class "C"
 20 11 felony.
 20 12    ANIMAL RESCUE == LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICERS.  A law
 20 13 enforcement officer (e.g., county sheriff or deputy sheriff)
 20 14 is authorized to rescue an animal from a motor vehicle based
 20 15 upon the officer's reasonable belief that the animal may be
 20 16 suffering distress.  The officer must provide a written notice
 20 17 of the rescue.  After the rescue, the animal must be maintained
 20 18 as a rescued animal by the local authority until it is claimed
 20 19 or disposed of pursuant to court order.
 20 20    MANDATORY REPORTING == VETERINARIANS TO LOCAL LAW
 20 21 ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES.  A veterinarian is required to report
 20 22 cases in which an animal may have suffered a serious injury due
 20 23 to animal abuse, animal neglect, or animal torture.  The board
 20 24 of veterinary medicine may prescribe the form of the report.
 20 25 The report must be submitted to the local law enforcement
 20 26 agency  having jurisdiction of the matter.
 20 27    MANDATORY REPORTING == LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES TO THE
 20 28 DEPARTMENT OF HUMAN SERVICES.  A local law enforcement agency
 20 29 must submit a report to the department of human services if a
 20 30 law enforcement officer conducts an investigation involving
 20 31 animal abuse, animal neglect, or animal torture and reasonably
 20 32 believes a minor child of the subject of the investigation
 20 33 witnessed the offense being committed.
 20 34    STATE MANDATE.  The bill may include a state mandate as
 20 35 defined in Code section 25B.3.  The bill makes inapplicable
 21  1 Code section 25B.2, subsection 3, which would relieve a

 17 28 481A.42).
 17 29    There are seven amended or new criminal offenses, including
 17 30 animal abuse in the first or second degree (amended Code
 17 31 section 717B.2 and new Code section 717B.2A), animal neglect
 17 32 in the first or second degree (new Code section 717B.2B
 17 33 and amended Code section 717B.3), animal torture (amended
 17 34 Code section 717B.3A), animal abandonment (new Code section
 17 35 717B.3B), and animal endangerment (new Code section 717B.3C).
 18  1  Each of the amended or new offenses includes an enhanced
 18  2 penalty that applies to a convicted person in either of two
 18  3 situations:  (1) the person is an adult who committed the
 18  4 offense in the presence of a juvenile or (2) the person has
 18  5 previously committed any of the offenses previously described;
 18  6 committed injury or interference with a police service dog
 18  7 (Code section 717B.9); committed bestiality (Code section
 18  8 717C.1); committed an offense involving animal fighting (Code
 18  9 section 717D.4); or committed any similar offense in another
 18 10 state.
 18 11    TYPES OF CRIMINAL OFFENSES == ABUSE, NEGLECT, OR TORTURE.
 18 12 Animal abuse involves injuring an animal by violence or
 18 13 poisoning; animal neglect involves failing to provide an animal
 18 14 with adequate food, water, habitable conditions, or necessary
 18 15 veterinary care; and animal torture involves inflicting upon
 18 16 the animal severe and prolonged or repeated physical pain.  For
 18 17 animal abuse in the first degree, animal neglect in the first
 18 18 degree, or animal torture, the animal must suffer a serious
 18 19 injury or death. Serious injury involves a substantial risk
 18 20 of death, protracted disfigurement, impairment, or a loss or
 18 21 impairment of a limb. For animal abuse in the second degree,
 18 22 the animal must suffer an injury meaning some impairment to the
 18 23 animal's health or functions, or death. For animal neglect in
 18 24 the second degree, the injury element is not required. For
 18 25 these offenses, the criminal penalties are as follows:  (1)
 18 26 animal abuse in the first degree, an aggravated misdemeanor
 18 27 which may be enhanced to a class "D" felony; (2) animal abuse
 18 28 in the second degree, a serious misdemeanor which may be
 18 29 enhanced to an aggravated misdemeanor; (3) animal neglect
 18 30 in the first degree, an aggravated misdemeanor which may be
 18 31 enhanced to a class "D" felony; (4)  animal neglect in the
 18 32 second degree, a serious misdemeanor which may be enhanced to
 18 33 an aggravated misdemeanor; and (5) animal torture, a class "D"
 18 34 felony which may be enhanced to a class "C" felony.
 18 35    A number of exceptions apply to the animal abuse and animal
 19  1 torture offenses, including carrying out (1) a court order; (2)
 19  2 a veterinary practice; (3) a good animal husbandry practice;
 19  3 (4) another provision of law; (5) legally hunting, trapping,
 19  4 or fishing; (6) a defense of property or life; (7) conduct
 19  5 by a local authority; and (8) research activities.  The bill
 19  6 eliminates a provision in the current abuse Code section that
 19  7 excepts an animal's owner from culpability.  The bill also
 19  8 eliminates an element of animal torture that requires proof of
 19  9 sadistic or depraved intent.
 19 10    TYPES OF CRIMINAL OFFENSES == ANIMAL ABANDONMENT AND ANIMAL
 19 11 ENDANGERMENT.  For animal abandonment, a person must knowingly
 19 12 or recklessly relinquish custody of an animal, and then fail
 19 13 to provide for its legal transfer or make arrangements for its
 19 14 care. For animal endangerment, a person must confine an animal
 19 15 in a stationary motor vehicle in a manner that endangers the
 19 16 health or life of the animal. For these last two offenses, the
 19 17 criminal penalties are the same: a simple misdemeanor which
 19 18 may be enhanced to a serious misdemeanor.
 19 19    APPLICABLE CRIMINAL PENALTIES.  The criminal penalties are
 19 20 as follows:  (1) simple misdemeanor,  confinement for no more
 19 21 than 30 days or a fine of at least $65 but not more than $625 or
 19 22 by both; (2)  serious misdemeanor, confinement for no more than
 19 23 one year and a fine of at least $315 but not more than $1,875;
 19 24 (3) aggravated misdemeanor, confinement for no more than two
 19 25 years and a fine of at least $625 but not more than $6,250; (4)
 19 26 class "D" felony, confinement for no more than five years and a
 19 27 fine of at least $750 but not more than $7,500; and (5) class
 19 28 "C" felony, confinement for no more than 10 years and a fine of
 19 29 at least $1,000 but not more than $10,000.
 19 30    COURT ORDERS.  At the time of conviction for committing
 19 31 any of the offenses, a person may be subject to a court order
 19 32 requiring a psychological or psychiatric evaluation and
 19 33 treatment.  The person may also be subject to a court order
 19 34 prohibiting the person from owning, possessing, or living with
 19 35 an animal of the same genus as the mistreated animal.  In each
 20  1 case, the court's decision to issue an order is discretionary
 20  2 except under certain conditions.  A court order requiring an
 20  3 evaluation and treatment is mandatory for juveniles.  That
 20  4 order and the order prohibiting contact with animals is
 20  5 also mandatory if the offense is punishable as an aggravated
 20  6 misdemeanor or felony.  For a discretionary court order,
 20  7 the  period of prohibition is from one to five years.  For a
 20  8 mandatory court order, the period of prohibition is as follows:
 20  9 (1)  one to five years for an aggravated misdemeanor, (2) 5 to
 20 10 15 years for a class "D" felony, and (3) life for a class "C"
 20 11 felony.
 20 12    ANIMAL RESCUE == LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICERS.  A law
 20 13 enforcement officer (e.g., county sheriff or deputy sheriff)
 20 14 is authorized to rescue an animal from a motor vehicle based
 20 15 upon the officer's reasonable belief that the animal may be
 20 16 suffering distress.  The officer must provide a written notice
 20 17 of the rescue.  After the rescue, the animal must be maintained
 20 18 as a rescued animal by the local authority until it is claimed
 20 19 or disposed of pursuant to court order.
 20 20    MANDATORY REPORTING == VETERINARIANS TO LOCAL LAW
 20 21 ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES.  A veterinarian is required to report
 20 22 cases in which an animal may have suffered a serious injury due
 20 23 to animal abuse, animal neglect, or animal torture.  The board
 20 24 of veterinary medicine may prescribe the form of the report.
 20 25 The report must be submitted to the local law enforcement
 20 26 agency  having jurisdiction of the matter.
 20 27    MANDATORY REPORTING == LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES TO THE
 20 28 DEPARTMENT OF HUMAN SERVICES.  A local law enforcement agency
 20 29 must submit a report to the department of human services if a
 20 30 law enforcement officer conducts an investigation involving
 20 31 animal abuse, animal neglect, or animal torture and reasonably
 20 32 believes a minor child of the subject of the investigation
 20 33 witnessed the offense being committed.
 20 34    STATE MANDATE.  The bill may include a state mandate as
 20 35 defined in Code section 25B.3.  The bill makes inapplicable

 18  2 penalty that applies to a convicted person in either of two
 18  3 situations:  (1) the person is an adult who committed the
 18  4 offense in the presence of a juvenile or (2) the person has
 18  5 previously committed any of the offenses previously described;
 18  6 committed injury or interference with a police service dog
 18  7 (Code section 717B.9); committed bestiality (Code section
 18  8 717C.1); committed an offense involving animal fighting (Code
 18  9 section 717D.4); or committed any similar offense in another
 18 10 state.
 18 11    TYPES OF CRIMINAL OFFENSES == ABUSE, NEGLECT, OR TORTURE.
 18 12 Animal abuse involves injuring an animal by violence or
 18 13 poisoning; animal neglect involves failing to provide an animal
 18 14 with adequate food, water, habitable conditions, or necessary
 18 15 veterinary care; and animal torture involves inflicting upon
 18 16 the animal severe and prolonged or repeated physical pain.  For
 18 17 animal abuse in the first degree, animal neglect in the first
 18 18 degree, or animal torture, the animal must suffer a serious
 18 19 injury or death. Serious injury involves a substantial risk
 18 20 of death, protracted disfigurement, impairment, or a loss or
 18 21 impairment of a limb. For animal abuse in the second degree,
 18 22 the animal must suffer an injury meaning some impairment to the
 18 23 animal's health or functions, or death. For animal neglect in
 18 24 the second degree, the injury element is not required. For
 18 25 these offenses, the criminal penalties are as follows:  (1)
 18 26 animal abuse in the first degree, an aggravated misdemeanor
 18 27 which may be enhanced to a class "D" felony; (2) animal abuse
 18 28 in the second degree, a serious misdemeanor which may be
 18 29 enhanced to an aggravated misdemeanor; (3) animal neglect
 18 30 in the first degree, an aggravated misdemeanor which may be
 18 31 enhanced to a class "D" felony; (4)  animal neglect in the
 18 32 second degree, a serious misdemeanor which may be enhanced to
 18 33 an aggravated misdemeanor; and (5) animal torture, a class "D"
 18 34 felony which may be enhanced to a class "C" felony.
 18 35    A number of exceptions apply to the animal abuse and animal
 19  1 torture offenses, including carrying out (1) a court order; (2)
 19  2 a veterinary practice; (3) a good animal husbandry practice;
 19  3 (4) another provision of law; (5) legally hunting, trapping,
 19  4 or fishing; (6) a defense of property or life; (7) conduct
 19  5 by a local authority; and (8) research activities.  The bill
 19  6 eliminates a provision in the current abuse Code section that
 19  7 excepts an animal's owner from culpability.  The bill also
 19  8 eliminates an element of animal torture that requires proof of
 19  9 sadistic or depraved intent.
 19 10    TYPES OF CRIMINAL OFFENSES == ANIMAL ABANDONMENT AND ANIMAL
 19 11 ENDANGERMENT.  For animal abandonment, a person must knowingly
 19 12 or recklessly relinquish custody of an animal, and then fail
 19 13 to provide for its legal transfer or make arrangements for its
 19 14 care. For animal endangerment, a person must confine an animal
 19 15 in a stationary motor vehicle in a manner that endangers the
 19 16 health or life of the animal. For these last two offenses, the
 19 17 criminal penalties are the same: a simple misdemeanor which
 19 18 may be enhanced to a serious misdemeanor.
 19 19    APPLICABLE CRIMINAL PENALTIES.  The criminal penalties are
 19 20 as follows:  (1) simple misdemeanor,  confinement for no more
 19 21 than 30 days or a fine of at least $65 but not more than $625 or
 19 22 by both; (2)  serious misdemeanor, confinement for no more than
 19 23 one year and a fine of at least $315 but not more than $1,875;
 19 24 (3) aggravated misdemeanor, confinement for no more than two
 19 25 years and a fine of at least $625 but not more than $6,250; (4)
 19 26 class "D" felony, confinement for no more than five years and a
 19 27 fine of at least $750 but not more than $7,500; and (5) class
 19 28 "C" felony, confinement for no more than 10 years and a fine of
 19 29 at least $1,000 but not more than $10,000.
 19 30    COURT ORDERS.  At the time of conviction for committing
 19 31 any of the offenses, a person may be subject to a court order
 19 32 requiring a psychological or psychiatric evaluation and
 19 33 treatment.  The person may also be subject to a court order
 19 34 prohibiting the person from owning, possessing, or living with
 19 35 an animal of the same genus as the mistreated animal.  In each
 20  1 case, the court's decision to issue an order is discretionary
 20  2 except under certain conditions.  A court order requiring an
 20  3 evaluation and treatment is mandatory for juveniles.  That
 20  4 order and the order prohibiting contact with animals is
 20  5 also mandatory if the offense is punishable as an aggravated
 20  6 misdemeanor or felony.  For a discretionary court order,
 20  7 the  period of prohibition is from one to five years.  For a
 20  8 mandatory court order, the period of prohibition is as follows:
 20  9 (1)  one to five years for an aggravated misdemeanor, (2) 5 to
 20 10 15 years for a class "D" felony, and (3) life for a class "C"
 20 11 felony.
 20 12    ANIMAL RESCUE == LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICERS.  A law
 20 13 enforcement officer (e.g., county sheriff or deputy sheriff)
 20 14 is authorized to rescue an animal from a motor vehicle based
 20 15 upon the officer's reasonable belief that the animal may be
 20 16 suffering distress.  The officer must provide a written notice
 20 17 of the rescue.  After the rescue, the animal must be maintained
 20 18 as a rescued animal by the local authority until it is claimed
 20 19 or disposed of pursuant to court order.
 20 20    MANDATORY REPORTING == VETERINARIANS TO LOCAL LAW
 20 21 ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES.  A veterinarian is required to report
 20 22 cases in which an animal may have suffered a serious injury due
 20 23 to animal abuse, animal neglect, or animal torture.  The board
 20 24 of veterinary medicine may prescribe the form of the report.
 20 25 The report must be submitted to the local law enforcement
 20 26 agency  having jurisdiction of the matter.
 20 27    MANDATORY REPORTING == LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES TO THE
 20 28 DEPARTMENT OF HUMAN SERVICES.  A local law enforcement agency
 20 29 must submit a report to the department of human services if a
 20 30 law enforcement officer conducts an investigation involving
 20 31 animal abuse, animal neglect, or animal torture and reasonably
 20 32 believes a minor child of the subject of the investigation
 20 33 witnessed the offense being committed.
 20 34    STATE MANDATE.  The bill may include a state mandate as
 20 35 defined in Code section 25B.3.  The bill makes inapplicable
 21  1 Code section 25B.2, subsection 3, which would relieve a
 21  2 political subdivision from complying with a state mandate if
 21  3 funding for the cost of the state mandate is not provided or
 21  4 specified.  Therefore, political subdivisions are required to
 21  5 comply with any state mandate included in the bill.

 18 33 an aggravated misdemeanor; and (5) animal torture, a class "D"
 18 34 felony which may be enhanced to a class "C" felony.
 18 35    A number of exceptions apply to the animal abuse and animal
 19  1 torture offenses, including carrying out (1) a court order; (2)
 19  2 a veterinary practice; (3) a good animal husbandry practice;
 19  3 (4) another provision of law; (5) legally hunting, trapping,
 19  4 or fishing; (6) a defense of property or life; (7) conduct
 19  5 by a local authority; and (8) research activities.  The bill
 19  6 eliminates a provision in the current abuse Code section that
 19  7 excepts an animal's owner from culpability.  The bill also
 19  8 eliminates an element of animal torture that requires proof of
 19  9 sadistic or depraved intent.
 19 10    TYPES OF CRIMINAL OFFENSES == ANIMAL ABANDONMENT AND ANIMAL
 19 11 ENDANGERMENT.  For animal abandonment, a person must knowingly
 19 12 or recklessly relinquish custody of an animal, and then fail
 19 13 to provide for its legal transfer or make arrangements for its
 19 14 care. For animal endangerment, a person must confine an animal
 19 15 in a stationary motor vehicle in a manner that endangers the
 19 16 health or life of the animal. For these last two offenses, the
 19 17 criminal penalties are the same: a simple misdemeanor which
 19 18 may be enhanced to a serious misdemeanor.
 19 19    APPLICABLE CRIMINAL PENALTIES.  The criminal penalties are
 19 20 as follows:  (1) simple misdemeanor,  confinement for no more
 19 21 than 30 days or a fine of at least $65 but not more than $625 or
 19 22 by both; (2)  serious misdemeanor, confinement for no more than
 19 23 one year and a fine of at least $315 but not more than $1,875;
 19 24 (3) aggravated misdemeanor, confinement for no more than two
 19 25 years and a fine of at least $625 but not more than $6,250; (4)
 19 26 class "D" felony, confinement for no more than five years and a
 19 27 fine of at least $750 but not more than $7,500; and (5) class
 19 28 "C" felony, confinement for no more than 10 years and a fine of
 19 29 at least $1,000 but not more than $10,000.
 19 30    COURT ORDERS.  At the time of conviction for committing
 19 31 any of the offenses, a person may be subject to a court order
 19 32 requiring a psychological or psychiatric evaluation and
 19 33 treatment.  The person may also be subject to a court order
 19 34 prohibiting the person from owning, possessing, or living with
 19 35 an animal of the same genus as the mistreated animal.  In each
 20  1 case, the court's decision to issue an order is discretionary
 20  2 except under certain conditions.  A court order requiring an
 20  3 evaluation and treatment is mandatory for juveniles.  That
 20  4 order and the order prohibiting contact with animals is
 20  5 also mandatory if the offense is punishable as an aggravated
 20  6 misdemeanor or felony.  For a discretionary court order,
 20  7 the  period of prohibition is from one to five years.  For a
 20  8 mandatory court order, the period of prohibition is as follows:
 20  9 (1)  one to five years for an aggravated misdemeanor, (2) 5 to
 20 10 15 years for a class "D" felony, and (3) life for a class "C"
 20 11 felony.
 20 12    ANIMAL RESCUE == LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICERS.  A law
 20 13 enforcement officer (e.g., county sheriff or deputy sheriff)
 20 14 is authorized to rescue an animal from a motor vehicle based
 20 15 upon the officer's reasonable belief that the animal may be
 20 16 suffering distress.  The officer must provide a written notice
 20 17 of the rescue.  After the rescue, the animal must be maintained
 20 18 as a rescued animal by the local authority until it is claimed
 20 19 or disposed of pursuant to court order.
 20 20    MANDATORY REPORTING == VETERINARIANS TO LOCAL LAW
 20 21 ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES.  A veterinarian is required to report
 20 22 cases in which an animal may have suffered a serious injury due
 20 23 to animal abuse, animal neglect, or animal torture.  The board
 20 24 of veterinary medicine may prescribe the form of the report.
 20 25 The report must be submitted to the local law enforcement
 20 26 agency  having jurisdiction of the matter.
 20 27    MANDATORY REPORTING == LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES TO THE
 20 28 DEPARTMENT OF HUMAN SERVICES.  A local law enforcement agency
 20 29 must submit a report to the department of human services if a
 20 30 law enforcement officer conducts an investigation involving
 20 31 animal abuse, animal neglect, or animal torture and reasonably
 20 32 believes a minor child of the subject of the investigation
 20 33 witnessed the offense being committed.
 20 34    STATE MANDATE.  The bill may include a state mandate as
 20 35 defined in Code section 25B.3.  The bill makes inapplicable
 21  1 Code section 25B.2, subsection 3, which would relieve a
 21  2 political subdivision from complying with a state mandate if
 21  3 funding for the cost of the state mandate is not provided or
 21  4 specified.  Therefore, political subdivisions are required to
 21  5 comply with any state mandate included in the bill.

 18  1  Each of the amended or new offenses includes an enhanced
 18  2 penalty that applies to a convicted person in either of two
 18  3 situations:  (1) the person is an adult who committed the
 18  4 offense in the presence of a juvenile or (2) the person has
 18  5 previously committed any of the offenses previously described;
 18  6 committed injury or interference with a police service dog
 18  7 (Code section 717B.9); committed bestiality (Code section
 18  8 717C.1); committed an offense involving animal fighting (Code
 18  9 section 717D.4); or committed any similar offense in another
 18 10 state.
 18 11    TYPES OF CRIMINAL OFFENSES == ABUSE, NEGLECT, OR TORTURE.
 18 12 Animal abuse involves injuring an animal by violence or
 18 13 poisoning; animal neglect involves failing to provide an animal
 18 14 with adequate food, water, habitable conditions, or necessary
 18 15 veterinary care; and animal torture involves inflicting upon
 18 16 the animal severe and prolonged or repeated physical pain.  For
 18 17 animal abuse in the first degree, animal neglect in the first
 18 18 degree, or animal torture, the animal must suffer a serious
 18 19 injury or death. Serious injury involves a substantial risk
 18 20 of death, protracted disfigurement, impairment, or a loss or
 18 21 impairment of a limb. For animal abuse in the second degree,
 18 22 the animal must suffer an injury meaning some impairment to the
 18 23 animal's health or functions, or death. For animal neglect in
 18 24 the second degree, the injury element is not required. For
 18 25 these offenses, the criminal penalties are as follows:  (1)
 18 26 animal abuse in the first degree, an aggravated misdemeanor
 18 27 which may be enhanced to a class "D" felony; (2) animal abuse
 18 28 in the second degree, a serious misdemeanor which may be
 18 29 enhanced to an aggravated misdemeanor; (3) animal neglect
 18 30 in the first degree, an aggravated misdemeanor which may be

 18 32 second degree, a serious misdemeanor which may be enhanced to
 18 33 an aggravated misdemeanor; and (5) animal torture, a class "D"
 18 34 felony which may be enhanced to a class "C" felony.

 19  1 torture offenses, including carrying out (1) a court order; (2)
 19  2 a veterinary practice; (3) a good animal husbandry practice;
 19  3 (4) another provision of law; (5) legally hunting, trapping,

 18 14 with adequate food, water, habitable conditions, or necessary
 18 15 veterinary care; and animal torture involves inflicting upon
 18 16 the animal severe and prolonged or repeated physical pain.  For
 18 17 animal abuse in the first degree, animal neglect in the first
 18 18 degree, or animal torture, the animal must suffer a serious
 18 19 injury or death. Serious injury involves a substantial risk
 18 20 of death, protracted disfigurement, impairment, or a loss or
 18 21 impairment of a limb. For animal abuse in the second degree,
 18 22 the animal must suffer an injury meaning some impairment to the
 18 23 animal's health or functions, or death. For animal neglect in
 18 24 the second degree, the injury element is not required. For
 18 25 these offenses, the criminal penalties are as follows:  (1)
 18 26 animal abuse in the first degree, an aggravated misdemeanor
 18 27 which may be enhanced to a class "D" felony; (2) animal abuse
 18 28 in the second degree, a serious misdemeanor which may be

 19  2 a veterinary practice; (3) a good animal husbandry practice;
 19  3 (4) another provision of law; (5) legally hunting, trapping,
 19  4 or fishing; (6) a defense of property or life; (7) conduct
 19  5 by a local authority; and (8) research activities.  The bill
 19  6 eliminates a provision in the current abuse Code section that
 19  7 excepts an animal's owner from culpability.  The bill also
 19  8 eliminates an element of animal torture that requires proof of
 19  9 sadistic or depraved intent.
 19 10    TYPES OF CRIMINAL OFFENSES == ANIMAL ABANDONMENT AND ANIMAL
 19 11 ENDANGERMENT.  For animal abandonment, a person must knowingly
 19 12 or recklessly relinquish custody of an animal, and then fail

 19 14 care. For animal endangerment, a person must confine an animal
 19 15 in a stationary motor vehicle in a manner that endangers the
 19 16 health or life of the animal. For these last two offenses, the
 19 17 criminal penalties are the same: a simple misdemeanor which
 19 18 may be enhanced to a serious misdemeanor.
 19 19    APPLICABLE CRIMINAL PENALTIES.  The criminal penalties are
 19 20 as follows:  (1) simple misdemeanor,  confinement for no more

 19 31 any of the offenses, a person may be subject to a court order
 19 32 requiring a psychological or psychiatric evaluation and
 19 33 treatment.  The person may also be subject to a court order
 19 34 prohibiting the person from owning, possessing, or living with
 19 35 an animal of the same genus as the mistreated animal.  In each
 20  1 case, the court's decision to issue an order is discretionary
 20  2 except under certain conditions.  A court order requiring an
 20  3 evaluation and treatment is mandatory for juveniles.  That
 20  4 order and the order prohibiting contact with animals is
 20  5 also mandatory if the offense is punishable as an aggravated
 20  6 misdemeanor or felony.  For a discretionary court order,
 20  7 the  period of prohibition is from one to five years.  For a
 20  8 mandatory court order, the period of prohibition is as follows:
 20  9 (1)  one to five years for an aggravated misdemeanor, (2) 5 to
 20 10 15 years for a class "D" felony, and (3) life for a class "C"
 20 11 felony.
 20 12    ANIMAL RESCUE == LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICERS.  A law
 20 13 enforcement officer (e.g., county sheriff or deputy sheriff)
 20 14 is authorized to rescue an animal from a motor vehicle based
 20 15 upon the officer's reasonable belief that the animal may be
 20 16 suffering distress.  The officer must provide a written notice
 20 17 of the rescue.  After the rescue, the animal must be maintained
 20 18 as a rescued animal by the local authority until it is claimed
 20 19 or disposed of pursuant to court order.
 20 20    MANDATORY REPORTING == VETERINARIANS TO LOCAL LAW
 20 21 ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES.  A veterinarian is required to report
 20 22 cases in which an animal may have suffered a serious injury due
 20 23 to animal abuse, animal neglect, or animal torture.  The board
 20 24 of veterinary medicine may prescribe the form of the report.
 20 25 The report must be submitted to the local law enforcement
 20 26 agency  having jurisdiction of the matter.
 20 27    MANDATORY REPORTING == LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES TO THE
 20 28 DEPARTMENT OF HUMAN SERVICES.  A local law enforcement agency
 20 29 must submit a report to the department of human services if a
 20 30 law enforcement officer conducts an investigation involving
 20 31 animal abuse, animal neglect, or animal torture and reasonably
 20 32 believes a minor child of the subject of the investigation
 20 33 witnessed the offense being committed.
 20 34    STATE MANDATE.  The bill may include a state mandate as
 20 35 defined in Code section 25B.3.  The bill makes inapplicable
 21  1 Code section 25B.2, subsection 3, which would relieve a
 21  2 political subdivision from complying with a state mandate if
 21  3 funding for the cost of the state mandate is not provided or
 21  4 specified.  Therefore, political subdivisions are required to
 21  5 comply with any state mandate included in the bill.

 18  1  Each of the amended or new offenses includes an enhanced
 18  2 penalty that applies to a convicted person in either of two
 18  3 situations:  (1) the person is an adult who committed the
 18  4 offense in the presence of a juvenile or (2) the person has
 18  5 previously committed any of the offenses previously described;
 18  6 committed injury or interference with a police service dog
 18  7 (Code section 717B.9); committed bestiality (Code section
 18  8 717C.1); committed an offense involving animal fighting (Code
 18  9 section 717D.4); or committed any similar offense in another
 18 10 state.
 18 11    TYPES OF CRIMINAL OFFENSES == ABUSE, NEGLECT, OR TORTURE.
 18 12 Animal abuse involves injuring an animal by violence or
 18 13 poisoning; animal neglect involves failing to provide an animal
 18 14 with adequate food, water, habitable conditions, or necessary
 18 15 veterinary care; and animal torture involves inflicting upon
 18 16 the animal severe and prolonged or repeated physical pain.  For
 18 17 animal abuse in the first degree, animal neglect in the first
 18 18 degree, or animal torture, the animal must suffer a serious
 18 19 injury or death. Serious injury involves a substantial risk
 18 20 of death, protracted disfigurement, impairment, or a loss or
 18 21 impairment of a limb. For animal abuse in the second degree,
 18 22 the animal must suffer an injury meaning some impairment to the
 18 23 animal's health or functions, or death. For animal neglect in
 18 24 the second degree, the injury element is not required. For
 18 25 these offenses, the criminal penalties are as follows:  (1)
 18 26 animal abuse in the first degree, an aggravated misdemeanor
 18 27 which may be enhanced to a class "D" felony; (2) animal abuse
 18 28 in the second degree, a serious misdemeanor which may be
 18 29 enhanced to an aggravated misdemeanor; (3) animal neglect
 18 30 in the first degree, an aggravated misdemeanor which may be
 18 31 enhanced to a class "D" felony; (4)  animal neglect in the
 18 32 second degree, a serious misdemeanor which may be enhanced to
 18 33 an aggravated misdemeanor; and (5) animal torture, a class "D"
 18 34 felony which may be enhanced to a class "C" felony.
 18 35    A number of exceptions apply to the animal abuse and animal
 19  1 torture offenses, including carrying out (1) a court order; (2)
 19  2 a veterinary practice; (3) a good animal husbandry practice;
 19  3 (4) another provision of law; (5) legally hunting, trapping,
 19  4 or fishing; (6) a defense of property or life; (7) conduct
 19  5 by a local authority; and (8) research activities.  The bill
 19  6 eliminates a provision in the current abuse Code section that
 19  7 excepts an animal's owner from culpability.  The bill also
 19  8 eliminates an element of animal torture that requires proof of
 19  9 sadistic or depraved intent.
 19 10    TYPES OF CRIMINAL OFFENSES == ANIMAL ABANDONMENT AND ANIMAL
 19 11 ENDANGERMENT.  For animal abandonment, a person must knowingly
 19 12 or recklessly relinquish custody of an animal, and then fail
 19 13 to provide for its legal transfer or make arrangements for its
 19 14 care. For animal endangerment, a person must confine an animal
 19 15 in a stationary motor vehicle in a manner that endangers the
 19 16 health or life of the animal. For these last two offenses, the
 19 17 criminal penalties are the same: a simple misdemeanor which
 19 18 may be enhanced to a serious misdemeanor.
 19 19    APPLICABLE CRIMINAL PENALTIES.  The criminal penalties are
 19 20 as follows:  (1) simple misdemeanor,  confinement for no more
 19 21 than 30 days or a fine of at least $65 but not more than $625 or
 19 22 by both; (2)  serious misdemeanor, confinement for no more than
 19 23 one year and a fine of at least $315 but not more than $1,875;
 19 24 (3) aggravated misdemeanor, confinement for no more than two
 19 25 years and a fine of at least $625 but not more than $6,250; (4)
 19 26 class "D" felony, confinement for no more than five years and a
 19 27 fine of at least $750 but not more than $7,500; and (5) class
 19 28 "C" felony, confinement for no more than 10 years and a fine of
 19 29 at least $1,000 but not more than $10,000.
 19 30    COURT ORDERS.  At the time of conviction for committing
 19 31 any of the offenses, a person may be subject to a court order
 19 32 requiring a psychological or psychiatric evaluation and
 19 33 treatment.  The person may also be subject to a court order
 19 34 prohibiting the person from owning, possessing, or living with
 19 35 an animal of the same genus as the mistreated animal.  In each
 20  1 case, the court's decision to issue an order is discretionary
 20  2 except under certain conditions.  A court order requiring an
 20  3 evaluation and treatment is mandatory for juveniles.  That
 20  4 order and the order prohibiting contact with animals is
 20  5 also mandatory if the offense is punishable as an aggravated
 20  6 misdemeanor or felony.  For a discretionary court order,
 20  7 the  period of prohibition is from one to five years.  For a
 20  8 mandatory court order, the period of prohibition is as follows:
 20  9 (1)  one to five years for an aggravated misdemeanor, (2) 5 to
 20 10 15 years for a class "D" felony, and (3) life for a class "C"
 20 11 felony.
 20 12    ANIMAL RESCUE == LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICERS.  A law
 20 13 enforcement officer (e.g., county sheriff or deputy sheriff)
 20 14 is authorized to rescue an animal from a motor vehicle based
 20 15 upon the officer's reasonable belief that the animal may be
 20 16 suffering distress.  The officer must provide a written notice
 20 17 of the rescue.  After the rescue, the animal must be maintained

 20 25 The report must be submitted to the local law enforcement
 20 26 agency  having jurisdiction of the matter.
 20 27    MANDATORY REPORTING == LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES TO THE
 20 28 DEPARTMENT OF HUMAN SERVICES.  A local law enforcement agency
 20 29 must submit a report to the department of human services if a
 20 30 law enforcement officer conducts an investigation involving
 20 31 animal abuse, animal neglect, or animal torture and reasonably
 20 32 believes a minor child of the subject of the investigation
 20 33 witnessed the offense being committed.
 20 34    STATE MANDATE.  The bill may include a state mandate as
 20 35 defined in Code section 25B.3.  The bill makes inapplicable
 21  1 Code section 25B.2, subsection 3, which would relieve a
 21  2 political subdivision from complying with a state mandate if
 21  3 funding for the cost of the state mandate is not provided or

 18 17 animal abuse in the first degree, animal neglect in the first
 18 18 degree, or animal torture, the animal must suffer a serious
 18 19 injury or death. Serious injury involves a substantial risk
 18 20 of death, protracted disfigurement, impairment, or a loss or
 18 21 impairment of a limb. For animal abuse in the second degree,
 18 22 the animal must suffer an injury meaning some impairment to the
 18 23 animal's health or functions, or death. For animal neglect in
 18 24 the second degree, the injury element is not required. For
 18 25 these offenses, the criminal penalties are as follows:  (1)
 18 26 animal abuse in the first degree, an aggravated misdemeanor
 18 27 which may be enhanced to a class "D" felony; (2) animal abuse
 18 28 in the second degree, a serious misdemeanor which may be

 18 14 with adequate food, water, habitable conditions, or necessary
 18 15 veterinary care; and animal torture involves inflicting upon
 18 16 the animal severe and prolonged or repeated physical pain.  For
 18 17 animal abuse in the first degree, animal neglect in the first
 18 18 degree, or animal torture, the animal must suffer a serious
 18 19 injury or death. Serious injury involves a substantial risk
 18 20 of death, protracted disfigurement, impairment, or a loss or
 18 21 impairment of a limb. For animal abuse in the second degree,
 18 22 the animal must suffer an injury meaning some impairment to the
 18 23 animal's health or functions, or death. For animal neglect in
 18 24 the second degree, the injury element is not required. For
 18 25 these offenses, the criminal penalties are as follows:  (1)
 18 26 animal abuse in the first degree, an aggravated misdemeanor
 18 27 which may be enhanced to a class "D" felony; (2) animal abuse
 18 28 in the second degree, a serious misdemeanor which may be
 18 29 enhanced to an aggravated misdemeanor; (3) animal neglect
 18 30 in the first degree, an aggravated misdemeanor which may be
 18 31 enhanced to a class "D" felony; (4)  animal neglect in the
 18 32 second degree, a serious misdemeanor which may be enhanced to
 18 33 an aggravated misdemeanor; and (5) animal torture, a class "D"
 18 34 felony which may be enhanced to a class "C" felony.
 18 35    A number of exceptions apply to the animal abuse and animal
 19  1 torture offenses, including carrying out (1) a court order; (2)
 19  2 a veterinary practice; (3) a good animal husbandry practice;
 19  3 (4) another provision of law; (5) legally hunting, trapping,
 19  4 or fishing; (6) a defense of property or life; (7) conduct
 19  5 by a local authority; and (8) research activities.  The bill
 19  6 eliminates a provision in the current abuse Code section that
 19  7 excepts an animal's owner from culpability.  The bill also
 19  8 eliminates an element of animal torture that requires proof of
 19  9 sadistic or depraved intent.
 19 10    TYPES OF CRIMINAL OFFENSES == ANIMAL ABANDONMENT AND ANIMAL
 19 11 ENDANGERMENT.  For animal abandonment, a person must knowingly
 19 12 or recklessly relinquish custody of an animal, and then fail
 19 13 to provide for its legal transfer or make arrangements for its
 19 14 care. For animal endangerment, a person must confine an animal
 19 15 in a stationary motor vehicle in a manner that endangers the
 19 16 health or life of the animal. For these last two offenses, the
 19 17 criminal penalties are the same: a simple misdemeanor which
 19 18 may be enhanced to a serious misdemeanor.
 19 19    APPLICABLE CRIMINAL PENALTIES.  The criminal penalties are
 19 20 as follows:  (1) simple misdemeanor,  confinement for no more
 19 21 than 30 days or a fine of at least $65 but not more than $625 or
 19 22 by both; (2)  serious misdemeanor, confinement for no more than
 19 23 one year and a fine of at least $315 but not more than $1,875;
 19 24 (3) aggravated misdemeanor, confinement for no more than two
 19 25 years and a fine of at least $625 but not more than $6,250; (4)
 19 26 class "D" felony, confinement for no more than five years and a
 19 27 fine of at least $750 but not more than $7,500; and (5) class
 19 28 "C" felony, confinement for no more than 10 years and a fine of
 19 29 at least $1,000 but not more than $10,000.
 19 30    COURT ORDERS.  At the time of conviction for committing
 19 31 any of the offenses, a person may be subject to a court order
 19 32 requiring a psychological or psychiatric evaluation and
 19 33 treatment.  The person may also be subject to a court order
 19 34 prohibiting the person from owning, possessing, or living with
 19 35 an animal of the same genus as the mistreated animal.  In each
 20  1 case, the court's decision to issue an order is discretionary
 20  2 except under certain conditions.  A court order requiring an
 20  3 evaluation and treatment is mandatory for juveniles.  That
 20  4 order and the order prohibiting contact with animals is
 20  5 also mandatory if the offense is punishable as an aggravated
 20  6 misdemeanor or felony.  For a discretionary court order,
 20  7 the  period of prohibition is from one to five years.  For a
 20  8 mandatory court order, the period of prohibition is as follows:
 20  9 (1)  one to five years for an aggravated misdemeanor, (2) 5 to
 20 10 15 years for a class "D" felony, and (3) life for a class "C"
 20 11 felony.
 20 12    ANIMAL RESCUE == LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICERS.  A law
 20 13 enforcement officer (e.g., county sheriff or deputy sheriff)
 20 14 is authorized to rescue an animal from a motor vehicle based
 20 15 upon the officer's reasonable belief that the animal may be
 20 16 suffering distress.  The officer must provide a written notice
 20 17 of the rescue.  After the rescue, the animal must be maintained
 20 18 as a rescued animal by the local authority until it is claimed
 20 19 or disposed of pursuant to court order.
 20 20    MANDATORY REPORTING == VETERINARIANS TO LOCAL LAW
 20 21 ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES.  A veterinarian is required to report
 20 22 cases in which an animal may have suffered a serious injury due
 20 23 to animal abuse, animal neglect, or animal torture.  The board
 20 24 of veterinary medicine may prescribe the form of the report.
 20 25 The report must be submitted to the local law enforcement
 20 26 agency  having jurisdiction of the matter.
 20 27    MANDATORY REPORTING == LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES TO THE
 20 28 DEPARTMENT OF HUMAN SERVICES.  A local law enforcement agency
 20 29 must submit a report to the department of human services if a
 20 30 law enforcement officer conducts an investigation involving
 20 31 animal abuse, animal neglect, or animal torture and reasonably
 20 32 believes a minor child of the subject of the investigation
 20 33 witnessed the offense being committed.
 20 34    STATE MANDATE.  The bill may include a state mandate as
 20 35 defined in Code section 25B.3.  The bill makes inapplicable
 21  1 Code section 25B.2, subsection 3, which would relieve a
 21  2 political subdivision from complying with a state mandate if
 21  3 funding for the cost of the state mandate is not provided or
 21  4 specified.  Therefore, political subdivisions are required to
 21  5 comply with any state mandate included in the bill.

 20 11 felony.
 20 12    ANIMAL RESCUE == LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICERS.  A law
 20 13 enforcement officer (e.g., county sheriff or deputy sheriff)
 20 14 is authorized to rescue an animal from a motor vehicle based
 20 15 upon the officer's reasonable belief that the animal may be
 20 16 suffering distress.  The officer must provide a written notice
 20 17 of the rescue.  After the rescue, the animal must be maintained
 20 18 as a rescued animal by the local authority until it is claimed
 20 19 or disposed of pursuant to court order.
 20 20    MANDATORY REPORTING == VETERINARIANS TO LOCAL LAW
 20 21 ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES.  A veterinarian is required to report

 18 10 state.
 18 11    TYPES OF CRIMINAL OFFENSES == ABUSE, NEGLECT, OR TORTURE.
 18 12 Animal abuse involves injuring an animal by violence or
 18 13 poisoning; animal neglect involves failing to provide an animal
 18 14 with adequate food, water, habitable conditions, or necessary
 18 15 veterinary care; and animal torture involves inflicting upon
 18 16 the animal severe and prolonged or repeated physical pain.  For
 18 17 animal abuse in the first degree, animal neglect in the first
 18 18 degree, or animal torture, the animal must suffer a serious
 18 19 injury or death. Serious injury involves a substantial risk
 18 20 of death, protracted disfigurement, impairment, or a loss or
 18 21 impairment of a limb. For animal abuse in the second degree,
 18 22 the animal must suffer an injury meaning some impairment to the
 18 23 animal's health or functions, or death. For animal neglect in
 18 24 the second degree, the injury element is not required. For
 18 25 these offenses, the criminal penalties are as follows:  (1)
 18 26 animal abuse in the first degree, an aggravated misdemeanor
 18 27 which may be enhanced to a class "D" felony; (2) animal abuse
 18 28 in the second degree, a serious misdemeanor which may be
 18 29 enhanced to an aggravated misdemeanor; (3) animal neglect
 18 30 in the first degree, an aggravated misdemeanor which may be
 18 31 enhanced to a class "D" felony; (4)  animal neglect in the
 18 32 second degree, a serious misdemeanor which may be enhanced to
 18 33 an aggravated misdemeanor; and (5) animal torture, a class "D"
 18 34 felony which may be enhanced to a class "C" felony.
 18 35    A number of exceptions apply to the animal abuse and animal
 19  1 torture offenses, including carrying out (1) a court order; (2)
 19  2 a veterinary practice; (3) a good animal husbandry practice;
 19  3 (4) another provision of law; (5) legally hunting, trapping,
 19  4 or fishing; (6) a defense of property or life; (7) conduct
 19  5 by a local authority; and (8) research activities.  The bill
 19  6 eliminates a provision in the current abuse Code section that
 19  7 excepts an animal's owner from culpability.  The bill also
 19  8 eliminates an element of animal torture that requires proof of
 19  9 sadistic or depraved intent.
 19 10    TYPES OF CRIMINAL OFFENSES == ANIMAL ABANDONMENT AND ANIMAL
 19 11 ENDANGERMENT.  For animal abandonment, a person must knowingly
 19 12 or recklessly relinquish custody of an animal, and then fail
 19 13 to provide for its legal transfer or make arrangements for its
 19 14 care. For animal endangerment, a person must confine an animal
 19 15 in a stationary motor vehicle in a manner that endangers the
 19 16 health or life of the animal. For these last two offenses, the
 19 17 criminal penalties are the same: a simple misdemeanor which
 19 18 may be enhanced to a serious misdemeanor.
 19 19    APPLICABLE CRIMINAL PENALTIES.  The criminal penalties are
 19 20 as follows:  (1) simple misdemeanor,  confinement for no more
 19 21 than 30 days or a fine of at least $65 but not more than $625 or
 19 22 by both; (2)  serious misdemeanor, confinement for no more than
 19 23 one year and a fine of at least $315 but not more than $1,875;
 19 24 (3) aggravated misdemeanor, confinement for no more than two
 19 25 years and a fine of at least $625 but not more than $6,250; (4)
 19 26 class "D" felony, confinement for no more than five years and a
 19 27 fine of at least $750 but not more than $7,500; and (5) class
 19 28 "C" felony, confinement for no more than 10 years and a fine of
 19 29 at least $1,000 but not more than $10,000.
 19 30    COURT ORDERS.  At the time of conviction for committing
 19 31 any of the offenses, a person may be subject to a court order
 19 32 requiring a psychological or psychiatric evaluation and
 19 33 treatment.  The person may also be subject to a court order
 19 34 prohibiting the person from owning, possessing, or living with
 19 35 an animal of the same genus as the mistreated animal.  In each
 20  1 case, the court's decision to issue an order is discretionary
 20  2 except under certain conditions.  A court order requiring an
 20  3 evaluation and treatment is mandatory for juveniles.  That
 20  4 order and the order prohibiting contact with animals is
 20  5 also mandatory if the offense is punishable as an aggravated
 20  6 misdemeanor or felony.  For a discretionary court order,
 20  7 the  period of prohibition is from one to five years.  For a
 20  8 mandatory court order, the period of prohibition is as follows:
 20  9 (1)  one to five years for an aggravated misdemeanor, (2) 5 to

 19 31 any of the offenses, a person may be subject to a court order
 19 32 requiring a psychological or psychiatric evaluation and
 19 33 treatment.  The person may also be subject to a court order
 19 34 prohibiting the person from owning, possessing, or living with
 19 35 an animal of the same genus as the mistreated animal.  In each
 20  1 case, the court's decision to issue an order is discretionary

 20  3 evaluation and treatment is mandatory for juveniles.  That
 20  4 order and the order prohibiting contact with animals is
 20  5 also mandatory if the offense is punishable as an aggravated
 20  6 misdemeanor or felony.  For a discretionary court order,

 18 11    TYPES OF CRIMINAL OFFENSES == ABUSE, NEGLECT, OR TORTURE.
 18 12 Animal abuse involves injuring an animal by violence or
 18 13 poisoning; animal neglect involves failing to provide an animal
 18 14 with adequate food, water, habitable conditions, or necessary
 18 15 veterinary care; and animal torture involves inflicting upon
 18 16 the animal severe and prolonged or repeated physical pain.  For
 18 17 animal abuse in the first degree, animal neglect in the first
 18 18 degree, or animal torture, the animal must suffer a serious
 18 19 injury or death. Serious injury involves a substantial risk
 18 20 of death, protracted disfigurement, impairment, or a loss or
 18 21 impairment of a limb. For animal abuse in the second degree,
 18 22 the animal must suffer an injury meaning some impairment to the
 18 23 animal's health or functions, or death. For animal neglect in
 18 24 the second degree, the injury element is not required. For
 18 25 these offenses, the criminal penalties are as follows:  (1)
 18 26 animal abuse in the first degree, an aggravated misdemeanor
 18 27 which may be enhanced to a class "D" felony; (2) animal abuse
 18 28 in the second degree, a serious misdemeanor which may be

 19  4 or fishing; (6) a defense of property or life; (7) conduct
 19  5 by a local authority; and (8) research activities.  The bill
 19  6 eliminates a provision in the current abuse Code section that

 19  9 sadistic or depraved intent.
 19 10    TYPES OF CRIMINAL OFFENSES == ANIMAL ABANDONMENT AND ANIMAL
 19 11 ENDANGERMENT.  For animal abandonment, a person must knowingly

 19 32 requiring a psychological or psychiatric evaluation and
 19 33 treatment.  The person may also be subject to a court order
 19 34 prohibiting the person from owning, possessing, or living with
 19 35 an animal of the same genus as the mistreated animal.  In each
 20  1 case, the court's decision to issue an order is discretionary
 20  2 except under certain conditions.  A court order requiring an
 20  3 evaluation and treatment is mandatory for juveniles.  That
 20  4 order and the order prohibiting contact with animals is
 20  5 also mandatory if the offense is punishable as an aggravated
 20  6 misdemeanor or felony.  For a discretionary court order,

 19 33 treatment.  The person may also be subject to a court order
 19 34 prohibiting the person from owning, possessing, or living with
 19 35 an animal of the same genus as the mistreated animal.  In each
 20  1 case, the court's decision to issue an order is discretionary

 20  3 evaluation and treatment is mandatory for juveniles.  That
 20  4 order and the order prohibiting contact with animals is
 20  5 also mandatory if the offense is punishable as an aggravated
 20  6 misdemeanor or felony.  For a discretionary court order,
