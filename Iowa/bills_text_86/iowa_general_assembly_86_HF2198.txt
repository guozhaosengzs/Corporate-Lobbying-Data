  7 10 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  7 11    This bill relates to persistently lowest=achieving schools
  7 12 by authorizing parents or guardians to petition for the closure
  7 13 of an attendance center, for implementation of an education
  7 14 voucher program, or for establishment of a charter school.
  7 15    Under the bill, if an attendance center is identified by
  7 16 the department of education as a persistently lowest=achieving
  7 17 school, the parents or guardians of students enrolled at
  7 18 the attendance center may submit a petition to the school
  7 19 board to either close the attendance center or authorize

  7 21 valid petition must state whether the petition is requesting
  7 22 the closure of an attendance center or the authorization of
  7 23 education vouchers, and must contain the signatures at least 50
  7 24 percent of the parents or guardians whose children are enrolled
  7 25 at the attendance center. A valid petition must be received by
  7 26 the school board not later than December 1 of the school year
  7 27 preceding the school year during which the requested action
  7 28 will be implemented. A petition received after that deadline
  7 29 will be considered a petition for the next applicable school
  7 30 year.
  7 31    If a valid petition for closure of an attendance center
  7 32 is received, the school board shall formulate and implement
  7 33 a plan for the closure of the attendance center and a plan
  7 34 for the reallocation of students currently enrolled at the
  7 35 attendance center and those students who would, but for the
  8  1 closure, be enrolled at the attendance center during the next
  8  2 school year. The bill requires the plan for the reallocation
  8  3 of students to other attendance centers in the school district
  8  4 to include objective criteria and standards and criteria for
  8  5 prioritizing requests that do not have an adverse impact on the
  8  6 plan. If other attendance centers in the school district have
  8  7 insufficient classroom space to accommodate the students from
  8  8 the closing attendance center, the school board shall instead
  8  9 implement the education voucher program established in the
  8 10 bill.
  8 11    Under the bill, the following students shall be eligible
  8 12 to receive an education voucher: (1) students eligible to

  8 14 attendance center at the time a petition authorizing education

  9  8    For the fiscal year commencing July 1, 2017, and each
  9  9 succeeding fiscal year, the bill appropriates from the general
  9 10 fund of the state to the department of management to be
  9 11 credited to the education voucher fund an amount necessary to
  9 12 pay all education vouchers approved for that fiscal year. For
  9 13 each student approved for an education voucher, the department
  9 14 is required to establish an account for that student in the
  9 15 education voucher fund. The amount of the student's education
  9 16 voucher shall be deposited into the student's account on July 1
  9 17 and such amount shall be immediately available for the payment
  9 18 of qualified educational expenses, as defined in the bill,
  9 19 incurred by the parent or guardian for the student during that
  9 20 fiscal year.
  9 21    The bill specifies that a nonpublic school or other entity
  9 22 that accepts payment from a parent or guardian using funds from
  9 23 a student's account in the education voucher fund shall not
  9 24 refund, rebate, or share any portion of such payment with the
  9 25 parent, guardian, or student.
  9 26    Moneys remaining in a student's account upon conclusion
  9 27 of the fiscal year shall remain in the student's account
  9 28 in the education voucher fund for the payment of qualified
  9 29 educational expenses in future fiscal years. However, for
  9 30 each student with a positive balance in the student's account
  9 31 in the education voucher fund upon graduation from high
  9 32 school or upon termination of the student's enrollment in the
  9 33 nonpublic school, those moneys in the student's account shall
  9 34 be transferred for deposit in the general fund of the state.
  9 35    The bill provides that a person who makes a false claim for
 10  1 the purpose of obtaining an education voucher or who knowingly
 10  2 receives the voucher or makes a payment from an account within
 10  3 the education voucher fund without being legally entitled to

 10  5 criminal penalty. The bill allows the department of management
 10  6 to initiate legal proceedings to recover vouchers and amounts
 10  7 improperly awarded or paid from accounts under the bill.
 10  8    The bill provides that a nonpublic school that accepts
 10  9 payment from a parent or guardian using funds from a student's
 10 10 account in the education voucher fund is not an agent of this
 10 11 state or other political subdivision of this state.
 10 12    The bill provides that moneys from an education voucher
 10 13 under the bill are not taxable income under Code chapter 422.
 10 14    Code chapter 256F establishes a process by which the
 10 15 principal, teachers, or parents and guardians of students at an
 10 16 existing public school may apply to the school board to convert
 10 17 an existing attendance center to a charter school. Current
 10 18 law requires the application to demonstrate the support of at
 10 19 least 50 percent of the teachers employed at the school on the
 10 20 date of the submission of the application and 50 percent of the
 10 21 parents or guardians voting whose children are enrolled at the
 10 22 school, provided that a majority of the parents or guardians
 10 23 eligible to vote participate in the ballot process, according
 10 24 to procedures established by rules of the state board.
 10 25    The bill modifies the application requirements for
 10 26 converting an existing attendance center to a charter school
 10 27 if the attendance center is a persistently lowest=achieving
 10 28 school. Under those circumstances, the application does not
 10 29 need to demonstrate teacher support and shall only be required

  7  9 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  7 10 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  7 11    This bill relates to persistently lowest=achieving schools
  7 12 by authorizing parents or guardians to petition for the closure
  7 13 of an attendance center, for implementation of an education
  7 14 voucher program, or for establishment of a charter school.
  7 15    Under the bill, if an attendance center is identified by
  7 16 the department of education as a persistently lowest=achieving
  7 17 school, the parents or guardians of students enrolled at
  7 18 the attendance center may submit a petition to the school
  7 19 board to either close the attendance center or authorize
  7 20 education vouchers for students of the attendance center. A
  7 21 valid petition must state whether the petition is requesting
  7 22 the closure of an attendance center or the authorization of
  7 23 education vouchers, and must contain the signatures at least 50
  7 24 percent of the parents or guardians whose children are enrolled
  7 25 at the attendance center. A valid petition must be received by
  7 26 the school board not later than December 1 of the school year
  7 27 preceding the school year during which the requested action
  7 28 will be implemented. A petition received after that deadline
  7 29 will be considered a petition for the next applicable school
  7 30 year.
  7 31    If a valid petition for closure of an attendance center
  7 32 is received, the school board shall formulate and implement
  7 33 a plan for the closure of the attendance center and a plan
  7 34 for the reallocation of students currently enrolled at the
  7 35 attendance center and those students who would, but for the
  8  1 closure, be enrolled at the attendance center during the next
  8  2 school year. The bill requires the plan for the reallocation
  8  3 of students to other attendance centers in the school district
  8  4 to include objective criteria and standards and criteria for
  8  5 prioritizing requests that do not have an adverse impact on the
  8  6 plan. If other attendance centers in the school district have
  8  7 insufficient classroom space to accommodate the students from
  8  8 the closing attendance center, the school board shall instead
  8  9 implement the education voucher program established in the
  8 10 bill.
  8 11    Under the bill, the following students shall be eligible
  8 12 to receive an education voucher: (1) students eligible to
  8 13 enroll in kindergarten through grade 12 who are enrolled at an
  8 14 attendance center at the time a petition authorizing education
  8 15 vouchers is filed with the school board and (2) students
  8 16 eligible to enroll in kindergarten through grade 12 who are
  8 17 enrolled at an attendance center that is to be closed under
  8 18 the bill and for whom there is insufficient classroom space at
  8 19 other attendance centers in the school district.
  8 20    By January 31 preceding the school year for which the
  8 21 education voucher is requested, the parent or guardian of
  8 22 the student requesting to receive an education voucher shall
  8 23 submit an application to the department of education, on
  8 24 application forms developed by the department, indicating
  8 25 that the parent or guardian intends to enroll the student in
  8 26 a nonpublic school. In addition to such information deemed
  8 27 appropriate by the department of education, the application
  8 28 shall require certification from the nonpublic school of the
  8 29 student's enrollment for the following school year. By March
  8 30 1 preceding the school year for which the education voucher
  8 31 is requested, the department of education shall notify the
  8 32 department of management of the number of students in each
  8 33 school district designated for the following school year to
  8 34 receive an education voucher. The department of education
  8 35 shall also notify the parent or guardian of such students who
  9  1 are approved to receive an education voucher.
  9  2    The bill authorizes education vouchers to be approved for
  9  3 one school year per application, and additional applications
  9  4 must be submitted for education vouchers in subsequent school

  9 20 fiscal year.
  9 21    The bill specifies that a nonpublic school or other entity
  9 22 that accepts payment from a parent or guardian using funds from
  9 23 a student's account in the education voucher fund shall not

  9 25 parent, guardian, or student.

  9 27 of the fiscal year shall remain in the student's account
  9 28 in the education voucher fund for the payment of qualified

  7  9 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  7 10 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  7 11    This bill relates to persistently lowest=achieving schools
  7 12 by authorizing parents or guardians to petition for the closure
  7 13 of an attendance center, for implementation of an education
  7 14 voucher program, or for establishment of a charter school.
  7 15    Under the bill, if an attendance center is identified by
  7 16 the department of education as a persistently lowest=achieving
  7 17 school, the parents or guardians of students enrolled at
  7 18 the attendance center may submit a petition to the school
  7 19 board to either close the attendance center or authorize
  7 20 education vouchers for students of the attendance center. A
  7 21 valid petition must state whether the petition is requesting
  7 22 the closure of an attendance center or the authorization of
  7 23 education vouchers, and must contain the signatures at least 50
  7 24 percent of the parents or guardians whose children are enrolled
  7 25 at the attendance center. A valid petition must be received by
  7 26 the school board not later than December 1 of the school year
  7 27 preceding the school year during which the requested action
  7 28 will be implemented. A petition received after that deadline
  7 29 will be considered a petition for the next applicable school
  7 30 year.
  7 31    If a valid petition for closure of an attendance center
  7 32 is received, the school board shall formulate and implement
  7 33 a plan for the closure of the attendance center and a plan
  7 34 for the reallocation of students currently enrolled at the
  7 35 attendance center and those students who would, but for the
  8  1 closure, be enrolled at the attendance center during the next
  8  2 school year. The bill requires the plan for the reallocation
  8  3 of students to other attendance centers in the school district
  8  4 to include objective criteria and standards and criteria for
  8  5 prioritizing requests that do not have an adverse impact on the
  8  6 plan. If other attendance centers in the school district have
  8  7 insufficient classroom space to accommodate the students from
  8  8 the closing attendance center, the school board shall instead
  8  9 implement the education voucher program established in the
  8 10 bill.
  8 11    Under the bill, the following students shall be eligible
  8 12 to receive an education voucher: (1) students eligible to
  8 13 enroll in kindergarten through grade 12 who are enrolled at an
  8 14 attendance center at the time a petition authorizing education
  8 15 vouchers is filed with the school board and (2) students
  8 16 eligible to enroll in kindergarten through grade 12 who are
  8 17 enrolled at an attendance center that is to be closed under
  8 18 the bill and for whom there is insufficient classroom space at
  8 19 other attendance centers in the school district.
  8 20    By January 31 preceding the school year for which the
  8 21 education voucher is requested, the parent or guardian of
  8 22 the student requesting to receive an education voucher shall
  8 23 submit an application to the department of education, on
  8 24 application forms developed by the department, indicating
  8 25 that the parent or guardian intends to enroll the student in
  8 26 a nonpublic school. In addition to such information deemed
  8 27 appropriate by the department of education, the application
  8 28 shall require certification from the nonpublic school of the
  8 29 student's enrollment for the following school year. By March
  8 30 1 preceding the school year for which the education voucher
  8 31 is requested, the department of education shall notify the
  8 32 department of management of the number of students in each
  8 33 school district designated for the following school year to
  8 34 receive an education voucher. The department of education
  8 35 shall also notify the parent or guardian of such students who
  9  1 are approved to receive an education voucher.
  9  2    The bill authorizes education vouchers to be approved for
  9  3 one school year per application, and additional applications
  9  4 must be submitted for education vouchers in subsequent school
  9  5 years. The education voucher is in an amount equal to 75
  9  6 percent of the district of residence's regular program district
  9  7 cost per pupil in the same school year.
  9  8    For the fiscal year commencing July 1, 2017, and each
  9  9 succeeding fiscal year, the bill appropriates from the general
  9 10 fund of the state to the department of management to be
  9 11 credited to the education voucher fund an amount necessary to
  9 12 pay all education vouchers approved for that fiscal year. For
  9 13 each student approved for an education voucher, the department
  9 14 is required to establish an account for that student in the
  9 15 education voucher fund. The amount of the student's education
  9 16 voucher shall be deposited into the student's account on July 1
  9 17 and such amount shall be immediately available for the payment
  9 18 of qualified educational expenses, as defined in the bill,
  9 19 incurred by the parent or guardian for the student during that
  9 20 fiscal year.
  9 21    The bill specifies that a nonpublic school or other entity
  9 22 that accepts payment from a parent or guardian using funds from
  9 23 a student's account in the education voucher fund shall not
  9 24 refund, rebate, or share any portion of such payment with the
  9 25 parent, guardian, or student.
  9 26    Moneys remaining in a student's account upon conclusion
  9 27 of the fiscal year shall remain in the student's account
  9 28 in the education voucher fund for the payment of qualified
  9 29 educational expenses in future fiscal years. However, for
  9 30 each student with a positive balance in the student's account
  9 31 in the education voucher fund upon graduation from high
  9 32 school or upon termination of the student's enrollment in the
  9 33 nonpublic school, those moneys in the student's account shall
  9 34 be transferred for deposit in the general fund of the state.
  9 35    The bill provides that a person who makes a false claim for

 10 10 account in the education voucher fund is not an agent of this
 10 11 state or other political subdivision of this state.

  7 12 by authorizing parents or guardians to petition for the closure
  7 13 of an attendance center, for implementation of an education
  7 14 voucher program, or for establishment of a charter school.
  7 15    Under the bill, if an attendance center is identified by
  7 16 the department of education as a persistently lowest=achieving
  7 17 school, the parents or guardians of students enrolled at
  7 18 the attendance center may submit a petition to the school
  7 19 board to either close the attendance center or authorize
  7 20 education vouchers for students of the attendance center. A
  7 21 valid petition must state whether the petition is requesting
  7 22 the closure of an attendance center or the authorization of
  7 23 education vouchers, and must contain the signatures at least 50
  7 24 percent of the parents or guardians whose children are enrolled
  7 25 at the attendance center. A valid petition must be received by
  7 26 the school board not later than December 1 of the school year
  7 27 preceding the school year during which the requested action
  7 28 will be implemented. A petition received after that deadline
  7 29 will be considered a petition for the next applicable school
  7 30 year.
  7 31    If a valid petition for closure of an attendance center
  7 32 is received, the school board shall formulate and implement
  7 33 a plan for the closure of the attendance center and a plan
  7 34 for the reallocation of students currently enrolled at the
  7 35 attendance center and those students who would, but for the
  8  1 closure, be enrolled at the attendance center during the next
  8  2 school year. The bill requires the plan for the reallocation
  8  3 of students to other attendance centers in the school district
  8  4 to include objective criteria and standards and criteria for
  8  5 prioritizing requests that do not have an adverse impact on the
  8  6 plan. If other attendance centers in the school district have
  8  7 insufficient classroom space to accommodate the students from
  8  8 the closing attendance center, the school board shall instead
  8  9 implement the education voucher program established in the
  8 10 bill.
  8 11    Under the bill, the following students shall be eligible
  8 12 to receive an education voucher: (1) students eligible to
  8 13 enroll in kindergarten through grade 12 who are enrolled at an
  8 14 attendance center at the time a petition authorizing education
  8 15 vouchers is filed with the school board and (2) students
  8 16 eligible to enroll in kindergarten through grade 12 who are
  8 17 enrolled at an attendance center that is to be closed under
  8 18 the bill and for whom there is insufficient classroom space at
  8 19 other attendance centers in the school district.
  8 20    By January 31 preceding the school year for which the
  8 21 education voucher is requested, the parent or guardian of
  8 22 the student requesting to receive an education voucher shall
  8 23 submit an application to the department of education, on
  8 24 application forms developed by the department, indicating
  8 25 that the parent or guardian intends to enroll the student in
  8 26 a nonpublic school. In addition to such information deemed
  8 27 appropriate by the department of education, the application
  8 28 shall require certification from the nonpublic school of the
  8 29 student's enrollment for the following school year. By March
  8 30 1 preceding the school year for which the education voucher
  8 31 is requested, the department of education shall notify the
  8 32 department of management of the number of students in each
  8 33 school district designated for the following school year to
  8 34 receive an education voucher. The department of education
  8 35 shall also notify the parent or guardian of such students who
  9  1 are approved to receive an education voucher.
  9  2    The bill authorizes education vouchers to be approved for
  9  3 one school year per application, and additional applications
  9  4 must be submitted for education vouchers in subsequent school
  9  5 years. The education voucher is in an amount equal to 75
  9  6 percent of the district of residence's regular program district
  9  7 cost per pupil in the same school year.
  9  8    For the fiscal year commencing July 1, 2017, and each
  9  9 succeeding fiscal year, the bill appropriates from the general
  9 10 fund of the state to the department of management to be
  9 11 credited to the education voucher fund an amount necessary to
  9 12 pay all education vouchers approved for that fiscal year. For
  9 13 each student approved for an education voucher, the department
  9 14 is required to establish an account for that student in the
  9 15 education voucher fund. The amount of the student's education
  9 16 voucher shall be deposited into the student's account on July 1
  9 17 and such amount shall be immediately available for the payment
  9 18 of qualified educational expenses, as defined in the bill,
  9 19 incurred by the parent or guardian for the student during that
  9 20 fiscal year.
  9 21    The bill specifies that a nonpublic school or other entity
  9 22 that accepts payment from a parent or guardian using funds from
  9 23 a student's account in the education voucher fund shall not
  9 24 refund, rebate, or share any portion of such payment with the
  9 25 parent, guardian, or student.
  9 26    Moneys remaining in a student's account upon conclusion
  9 27 of the fiscal year shall remain in the student's account
  9 28 in the education voucher fund for the payment of qualified
  9 29 educational expenses in future fiscal years. However, for
  9 30 each student with a positive balance in the student's account
  9 31 in the education voucher fund upon graduation from high
  9 32 school or upon termination of the student's enrollment in the
  9 33 nonpublic school, those moneys in the student's account shall
  9 34 be transferred for deposit in the general fund of the state.
  9 35    The bill provides that a person who makes a false claim for
 10  1 the purpose of obtaining an education voucher or who knowingly
 10  2 receives the voucher or makes a payment from an account within
 10  3 the education voucher fund without being legally entitled to
 10  4 it is guilty of a fraudulent practice and is subject to a
 10  5 criminal penalty. The bill allows the department of management
 10  6 to initiate legal proceedings to recover vouchers and amounts
 10  7 improperly awarded or paid from accounts under the bill.
 10  8    The bill provides that a nonpublic school that accepts
 10  9 payment from a parent or guardian using funds from a student's
 10 10 account in the education voucher fund is not an agent of this
 10 11 state or other political subdivision of this state.
 10 12    The bill provides that moneys from an education voucher
 10 13 under the bill are not taxable income under Code chapter 422.
 10 14    Code chapter 256F establishes a process by which the
 10 15 principal, teachers, or parents and guardians of students at an
 10 16 existing public school may apply to the school board to convert
 10 17 an existing attendance center to a charter school. Current
 10 18 law requires the application to demonstrate the support of at
 10 19 least 50 percent of the teachers employed at the school on the
 10 20 date of the submission of the application and 50 percent of the
 10 21 parents or guardians voting whose children are enrolled at the
 10 22 school, provided that a majority of the parents or guardians
 10 23 eligible to vote participate in the ballot process, according
 10 24 to procedures established by rules of the state board.
 10 25    The bill modifies the application requirements for
 10 26 converting an existing attendance center to a charter school
 10 27 if the attendance center is a persistently lowest=achieving
 10 28 school. Under those circumstances, the application does not
 10 29 need to demonstrate teacher support and shall only be required
 10 30 to demonstrate the support of at least 50 percent of the
 10 31 parents or guardians voting whose children are enrolled at the
 10 32 school, provided that a majority of the parents or guardians

  8 27 appropriate by the department of education, the application
  8 28 shall require certification from the nonpublic school of the
  8 29 student's enrollment for the following school year. By March
  8 30 1 preceding the school year for which the education voucher
  8 31 is requested, the department of education shall notify the
  8 32 department of management of the number of students in each
  8 33 school district designated for the following school year to
  8 34 receive an education voucher. The department of education
  8 35 shall also notify the parent or guardian of such students who
  9  1 are approved to receive an education voucher.
  9  2    The bill authorizes education vouchers to be approved for
  9  3 one school year per application, and additional applications
  9  4 must be submitted for education vouchers in subsequent school

  9 10 fund of the state to the department of management to be
  9 11 credited to the education voucher fund an amount necessary to
  9 12 pay all education vouchers approved for that fiscal year. For
  9 13 each student approved for an education voucher, the department
  9 14 is required to establish an account for that student in the
  9 15 education voucher fund. The amount of the student's education
  9 16 voucher shall be deposited into the student's account on July 1
  9 17 and such amount shall be immediately available for the payment
  9 18 of qualified educational expenses, as defined in the bill,
  9 19 incurred by the parent or guardian for the student during that
  9 20 fiscal year.
  9 21    The bill specifies that a nonpublic school or other entity
  9 22 that accepts payment from a parent or guardian using funds from
  9 23 a student's account in the education voucher fund shall not
  9 24 refund, rebate, or share any portion of such payment with the
  9 25 parent, guardian, or student.
  9 26    Moneys remaining in a student's account upon conclusion
  9 27 of the fiscal year shall remain in the student's account
  9 28 in the education voucher fund for the payment of qualified
  9 29 educational expenses in future fiscal years. However, for
  9 30 each student with a positive balance in the student's account
  9 31 in the education voucher fund upon graduation from high
  9 32 school or upon termination of the student's enrollment in the
  9 33 nonpublic school, those moneys in the student's account shall
  9 34 be transferred for deposit in the general fund of the state.
  9 35    The bill provides that a person who makes a false claim for
 10  1 the purpose of obtaining an education voucher or who knowingly
 10  2 receives the voucher or makes a payment from an account within
 10  3 the education voucher fund without being legally entitled to

 10  5 criminal penalty. The bill allows the department of management
 10  6 to initiate legal proceedings to recover vouchers and amounts
 10  7 improperly awarded or paid from accounts under the bill.
 10  8    The bill provides that a nonpublic school that accepts
 10  9 payment from a parent or guardian using funds from a student's
 10 10 account in the education voucher fund is not an agent of this
 10 11 state or other political subdivision of this state.
 10 12    The bill provides that moneys from an education voucher
 10 13 under the bill are not taxable income under Code chapter 422.
 10 14    Code chapter 256F establishes a process by which the
 10 15 principal, teachers, or parents and guardians of students at an
 10 16 existing public school may apply to the school board to convert
 10 17 an existing attendance center to a charter school. Current
 10 18 law requires the application to demonstrate the support of at
 10 19 least 50 percent of the teachers employed at the school on the
 10 20 date of the submission of the application and 50 percent of the
 10 21 parents or guardians voting whose children are enrolled at the
 10 22 school, provided that a majority of the parents or guardians
 10 23 eligible to vote participate in the ballot process, according
 10 24 to procedures established by rules of the state board.
 10 25    The bill modifies the application requirements for
 10 26 converting an existing attendance center to a charter school
 10 27 if the attendance center is a persistently lowest=achieving
 10 28 school. Under those circumstances, the application does not
 10 29 need to demonstrate teacher support and shall only be required
 10 30 to demonstrate the support of at least 50 percent of the
 10 31 parents or guardians voting whose children are enrolled at the
 10 32 school, provided that a majority of the parents or guardians

 10 16 existing public school may apply to the school board to convert
 10 17 an existing attendance center to a charter school. Current
 10 18 law requires the application to demonstrate the support of at
 10 19 least 50 percent of the teachers employed at the school on the
 10 20 date of the submission of the application and 50 percent of the
 10 21 parents or guardians voting whose children are enrolled at the
 10 22 school, provided that a majority of the parents or guardians
 10 23 eligible to vote participate in the ballot process, according
 10 24 to procedures established by rules of the state board.
 10 25    The bill modifies the application requirements for
 10 26 converting an existing attendance center to a charter school
 10 27 if the attendance center is a persistently lowest=achieving
 10 28 school. Under those circumstances, the application does not
 10 29 need to demonstrate teacher support and shall only be required
 10 30 to demonstrate the support of at least 50 percent of the
 10 31 parents or guardians voting whose children are enrolled at the
 10 32 school, provided that a majority of the parents or guardians

  7 27 preceding the school year during which the requested action
  7 28 will be implemented. A petition received after that deadline
  7 29 will be considered a petition for the next applicable school
  7 30 year.
  7 31    If a valid petition for closure of an attendance center
  7 32 is received, the school board shall formulate and implement
  7 33 a plan for the closure of the attendance center and a plan
  7 34 for the reallocation of students currently enrolled at the
  7 35 attendance center and those students who would, but for the
  8  1 closure, be enrolled at the attendance center during the next

  8  3 of students to other attendance centers in the school district
  8  4 to include objective criteria and standards and criteria for
  8  5 prioritizing requests that do not have an adverse impact on the
  8  6 plan. If other attendance centers in the school district have
  8  7 insufficient classroom space to accommodate the students from
  8  8 the closing attendance center, the school board shall instead
  8  9 implement the education voucher program established in the
  8 10 bill.
  8 11    Under the bill, the following students shall be eligible
  8 12 to receive an education voucher: (1) students eligible to
  8 13 enroll in kindergarten through grade 12 who are enrolled at an
  8 14 attendance center at the time a petition authorizing education
  8 15 vouchers is filed with the school board and (2) students
  8 16 eligible to enroll in kindergarten through grade 12 who are
  8 17 enrolled at an attendance center that is to be closed under
  8 18 the bill and for whom there is insufficient classroom space at
  8 19 other attendance centers in the school district.
  8 20    By January 31 preceding the school year for which the
  8 21 education voucher is requested, the parent or guardian of
  8 22 the student requesting to receive an education voucher shall
  8 23 submit an application to the department of education, on
  8 24 application forms developed by the department, indicating
  8 25 that the parent or guardian intends to enroll the student in
  8 26 a nonpublic school. In addition to such information deemed
  8 27 appropriate by the department of education, the application
  8 28 shall require certification from the nonpublic school of the
  8 29 student's enrollment for the following school year. By March
  8 30 1 preceding the school year for which the education voucher
  8 31 is requested, the department of education shall notify the
  8 32 department of management of the number of students in each
  8 33 school district designated for the following school year to
  8 34 receive an education voucher. The department of education
  8 35 shall also notify the parent or guardian of such students who

  9  5 years. The education voucher is in an amount equal to 75
  9  6 percent of the district of residence's regular program district
  9  7 cost per pupil in the same school year.
  9  8    For the fiscal year commencing July 1, 2017, and each
  9  9 succeeding fiscal year, the bill appropriates from the general
  9 10 fund of the state to the department of management to be
  9 11 credited to the education voucher fund an amount necessary to
  9 12 pay all education vouchers approved for that fiscal year. For
  9 13 each student approved for an education voucher, the department
  9 14 is required to establish an account for that student in the
  9 15 education voucher fund. The amount of the student's education
  9 16 voucher shall be deposited into the student's account on July 1
  9 17 and such amount shall be immediately available for the payment
  9 18 of qualified educational expenses, as defined in the bill,
  9 19 incurred by the parent or guardian for the student during that
  9 20 fiscal year.
  9 21    The bill specifies that a nonpublic school or other entity
  9 22 that accepts payment from a parent or guardian using funds from
  9 23 a student's account in the education voucher fund shall not
  9 24 refund, rebate, or share any portion of such payment with the
  9 25 parent, guardian, or student.
  9 26    Moneys remaining in a student's account upon conclusion
  9 27 of the fiscal year shall remain in the student's account
  9 28 in the education voucher fund for the payment of qualified
  9 29 educational expenses in future fiscal years. However, for
  9 30 each student with a positive balance in the student's account
  9 31 in the education voucher fund upon graduation from high
  9 32 school or upon termination of the student's enrollment in the
  9 33 nonpublic school, those moneys in the student's account shall
  9 34 be transferred for deposit in the general fund of the state.
  9 35    The bill provides that a person who makes a false claim for
 10  1 the purpose of obtaining an education voucher or who knowingly
 10  2 receives the voucher or makes a payment from an account within
 10  3 the education voucher fund without being legally entitled to

 10  5 criminal penalty. The bill allows the department of management
 10  6 to initiate legal proceedings to recover vouchers and amounts
 10  7 improperly awarded or paid from accounts under the bill.
 10  8    The bill provides that a nonpublic school that accepts
 10  9 payment from a parent or guardian using funds from a student's
 10 10 account in the education voucher fund is not an agent of this
 10 11 state or other political subdivision of this state.

 10 18 law requires the application to demonstrate the support of at
 10 19 least 50 percent of the teachers employed at the school on the
 10 20 date of the submission of the application and 50 percent of the
 10 21 parents or guardians voting whose children are enrolled at the

  8  3 of students to other attendance centers in the school district
  8  4 to include objective criteria and standards and criteria for
  8  5 prioritizing requests that do not have an adverse impact on the
  8  6 plan. If other attendance centers in the school district have
  8  7 insufficient classroom space to accommodate the students from
  8  8 the closing attendance center, the school board shall instead
  8  9 implement the education voucher program established in the
  8 10 bill.
  8 11    Under the bill, the following students shall be eligible
  8 12 to receive an education voucher: (1) students eligible to
  8 13 enroll in kindergarten through grade 12 who are enrolled at an
  8 14 attendance center at the time a petition authorizing education
  8 15 vouchers is filed with the school board and (2) students
  8 16 eligible to enroll in kindergarten through grade 12 who are
  8 17 enrolled at an attendance center that is to be closed under
  8 18 the bill and for whom there is insufficient classroom space at
  8 19 other attendance centers in the school district.
  8 20    By January 31 preceding the school year for which the
  8 21 education voucher is requested, the parent or guardian of
  8 22 the student requesting to receive an education voucher shall
  8 23 submit an application to the department of education, on
  8 24 application forms developed by the department, indicating
  8 25 that the parent or guardian intends to enroll the student in
  8 26 a nonpublic school. In addition to such information deemed
  8 27 appropriate by the department of education, the application
  8 28 shall require certification from the nonpublic school of the
  8 29 student's enrollment for the following school year. By March
  8 30 1 preceding the school year for which the education voucher
  8 31 is requested, the department of education shall notify the
  8 32 department of management of the number of students in each
  8 33 school district designated for the following school year to
  8 34 receive an education voucher. The department of education
  8 35 shall also notify the parent or guardian of such students who
  9  1 are approved to receive an education voucher.
  9  2    The bill authorizes education vouchers to be approved for
  9  3 one school year per application, and additional applications
  9  4 must be submitted for education vouchers in subsequent school
  9  5 years. The education voucher is in an amount equal to 75
  9  6 percent of the district of residence's regular program district
  9  7 cost per pupil in the same school year.
  9  8    For the fiscal year commencing July 1, 2017, and each
  9  9 succeeding fiscal year, the bill appropriates from the general
  9 10 fund of the state to the department of management to be
  9 11 credited to the education voucher fund an amount necessary to
  9 12 pay all education vouchers approved for that fiscal year. For
  9 13 each student approved for an education voucher, the department
  9 14 is required to establish an account for that student in the
  9 15 education voucher fund. The amount of the student's education
  9 16 voucher shall be deposited into the student's account on July 1
  9 17 and such amount shall be immediately available for the payment
  9 18 of qualified educational expenses, as defined in the bill,
  9 19 incurred by the parent or guardian for the student during that
  9 20 fiscal year.
  9 21    The bill specifies that a nonpublic school or other entity
  9 22 that accepts payment from a parent or guardian using funds from
  9 23 a student's account in the education voucher fund shall not
  9 24 refund, rebate, or share any portion of such payment with the
  9 25 parent, guardian, or student.
  9 26    Moneys remaining in a student's account upon conclusion
  9 27 of the fiscal year shall remain in the student's account
  9 28 in the education voucher fund for the payment of qualified
  9 29 educational expenses in future fiscal years. However, for
  9 30 each student with a positive balance in the student's account
  9 31 in the education voucher fund upon graduation from high
  9 32 school or upon termination of the student's enrollment in the
  9 33 nonpublic school, those moneys in the student's account shall
  9 34 be transferred for deposit in the general fund of the state.
  9 35    The bill provides that a person who makes a false claim for
 10  1 the purpose of obtaining an education voucher or who knowingly
 10  2 receives the voucher or makes a payment from an account within
 10  3 the education voucher fund without being legally entitled to

 10  5 criminal penalty. The bill allows the department of management
 10  6 to initiate legal proceedings to recover vouchers and amounts
 10  7 improperly awarded or paid from accounts under the bill.
 10  8    The bill provides that a nonpublic school that accepts
 10  9 payment from a parent or guardian using funds from a student's
 10 10 account in the education voucher fund is not an agent of this
 10 11 state or other political subdivision of this state.
 10 12    The bill provides that moneys from an education voucher
 10 13 under the bill are not taxable income under Code chapter 422.
 10 14    Code chapter 256F establishes a process by which the
 10 15 principal, teachers, or parents and guardians of students at an
 10 16 existing public school may apply to the school board to convert
 10 17 an existing attendance center to a charter school. Current
 10 18 law requires the application to demonstrate the support of at
 10 19 least 50 percent of the teachers employed at the school on the
 10 20 date of the submission of the application and 50 percent of the
 10 21 parents or guardians voting whose children are enrolled at the
 10 22 school, provided that a majority of the parents or guardians
 10 23 eligible to vote participate in the ballot process, according
 10 24 to procedures established by rules of the state board.
 10 25    The bill modifies the application requirements for
 10 26 converting an existing attendance center to a charter school
 10 27 if the attendance center is a persistently lowest=achieving
 10 28 school. Under those circumstances, the application does not
 10 29 need to demonstrate teacher support and shall only be required
 10 30 to demonstrate the support of at least 50 percent of the
 10 31 parents or guardians voting whose children are enrolled at the
 10 32 school, provided that a majority of the parents or guardians

  8  7 insufficient classroom space to accommodate the students from
  8  8 the closing attendance center, the school board shall instead
  8  9 implement the education voucher program established in the

  8 27 appropriate by the department of education, the application
  8 28 shall require certification from the nonpublic school of the

  9 14 is required to establish an account for that student in the
  9 15 education voucher fund. The amount of the student's education
  9 16 voucher shall be deposited into the student's account on July 1
  9 17 and such amount shall be immediately available for the payment
  9 18 of qualified educational expenses, as defined in the bill,
  9 19 incurred by the parent or guardian for the student during that
  9 20 fiscal year.
  9 21    The bill specifies that a nonpublic school or other entity
  9 22 that accepts payment from a parent or guardian using funds from
  9 23 a student's account in the education voucher fund shall not

  9 27 of the fiscal year shall remain in the student's account
  9 28 in the education voucher fund for the payment of qualified

 10  8    The bill provides that a nonpublic school that accepts
