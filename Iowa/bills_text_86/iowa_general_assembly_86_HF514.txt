 10  4 providing proof of financial liability coverage or proof that
 10  5 the owner is exempt from the requirement to maintain financial
 10  6 liability coverage.  If the owner fails to respond, a second
 10  7 notice will be sent.  If the owner does not respond to the
 10  8 second notice, the owner's motor vehicle registration will be
 10  9 revoked by the department and the owner will be required to
 10 10 surrender the registration plates and registration receipt for
 10 11 the vehicle to the county treasurer.  In order to obtain a
 10 12 new registration for the vehicle, the owner must comply with
 10 13 financial responsibility requirements and pay an administrative
 10 14 fee of $100. The fees are to be used by the department

 10 21 policy, that fact shall be noted in the database.
 10 22    The bill prohibits a person from providing false or
 10 23 fraudulent information to the department or the department's
 10 24 designated agent in relation to the motor vehicle insurance
 10 25 verification program.  A violation is a simple misdemeanor.

 10 27 includes motor vehicle liability coverage, uninsured motorist
 10 28 coverage, underinsured motorist coverage, or personal injury
 10 29 coverage to the owner of a motor vehicle to provide, before the
 10 30 7th and the 21st of each month, to the department's designated

 10 34 subject to apportioned registration are not included in this
 10 35 requirement.  Insurers that fail to comply with the reporting
 11  1 requirement may be assessed a civil penalty of $250 per day.

 11  3 that the failure was inadvertent, accidental, or the result
 11  4 of excusable neglect. An insurer that discloses records to

 11  6 effort to comply with the bill is not subject to the penalty.
 11  7    Information contained in the database is confidential,

  9 22    The designated agent is required to establish and maintain a

  9 28 department.
  9 29    At least twice a month, the designated agent shall update the
  9 30 database and compare current motor vehicle registrations with
  9 31 updated insurance information.  The files in the database shall
  9 32 be archived semiannually and audited by the department at least

  9 34 administration of the database.
  9 35    If database records show that a registered motor vehicle
 10  1 is not covered under an owner's policy of liability insurance
 10  2 for three months, the designated agent shall send a notice to
 10  3 the owner requiring the owner to respond within 15 days by

  9 14                           EXPLANATION
  9 15 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  9 16 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  9 17    This bill establishes a motor vehicle insurance verification
  9 18 program within the department of transportation.  The
  9 19 department is required to contract with a third party to act
  9 20 as the department's designated agent for administration of the
  9 21 program.
  9 22    The designated agent is required to establish and maintain a
  9 23 database containing information from insurers relating to motor
  9 24 vehicle insurance coverage for registered motor vehicles, motor
  9 25 vehicle identification information, personal identification
  9 26 information for registered owners of motor vehicles, and any
  9 27 other information provided to the designated agent by the
  9 28 department.
  9 29    At least twice a month, the designated agent shall update the
  9 30 database and compare current motor vehicle registrations with
  9 31 updated insurance information.  The files in the database shall
  9 32 be archived semiannually and audited by the department at least
  9 33 annually.  The bill requires the department to adopt rules for
  9 34 administration of the database.
  9 35    If database records show that a registered motor vehicle
 10  1 is not covered under an owner's policy of liability insurance
 10  2 for three months, the designated agent shall send a notice to
 10  3 the owner requiring the owner to respond within 15 days by
 10  4 providing proof of financial liability coverage or proof that
 10  5 the owner is exempt from the requirement to maintain financial
 10  6 liability coverage.  If the owner fails to respond, a second
 10  7 notice will be sent.  If the owner does not respond to the
 10  8 second notice, the owner's motor vehicle registration will be
 10  9 revoked by the department and the owner will be required to
 10 10 surrender the registration plates and registration receipt for
 10 11 the vehicle to the county treasurer.  In order to obtain a
 10 12 new registration for the vehicle, the owner must comply with
 10 13 financial responsibility requirements and pay an administrative
 10 14 fee of $100. The fees are to be used by the department
 10 15 exclusively to offset the costs of administering the program.
 10 16 Any fees in excess of the amount needed for administration of
 10 17 the program are to be transferred to the road use tax fund
 10 18 annually on June 30.
 10 19    The bill provides that if a motor vehicle is covered by a
 10 20 form of financial liability coverage other than an insurance
 10 21 policy, that fact shall be noted in the database.
 10 22    The bill prohibits a person from providing false or
 10 23 fraudulent information to the department or the department's
 10 24 designated agent in relation to the motor vehicle insurance
 10 25 verification program.  A violation is a simple misdemeanor.
 10 26    The bill requires each insurer that issues a policy that
 10 27 includes motor vehicle liability coverage, uninsured motorist
 10 28 coverage, underinsured motorist coverage, or personal injury
 10 29 coverage to the owner of a motor vehicle to provide, before the
 10 30 7th and the 21st of each month, to the department's designated
 10 31 agent a record of each motor vehicle insurance policy issued by
 10 32 the insurer and in effect for vehicles registered or garaged in
 10 33 this state as of the date of the previous submission. Vehicles
 10 34 subject to apportioned registration are not included in this
 10 35 requirement.  Insurers that fail to comply with the reporting
 11  1 requirement may be assessed a civil penalty of $250 per day.
 11  2 However, the department may waive the penalty upon a showing
 11  3 that the failure was inadvertent, accidental, or the result
 11  4 of excusable neglect. An insurer that discloses records to
 11  5 the department's designated agent in a reasonable, good=faith
 11  6 effort to comply with the bill is not subject to the penalty.
 11  7    Information contained in the database is confidential,
 11  8 but the bill provides exceptions for disclosures to state or
 11  9 local government agencies and courts for specified purposes;
 11 10 to individuals and certain other authorized persons; for
 11 11 purposes of an accident investigation; to law enforcement
 11 12 agencies and peace officers for certain official purposes;
 11 13 to the state auditor; and to financial institutions with a
 11 14 security interest in a motor vehicle.  The designated agent
 11 15 may be authorized to provide certified copies or electronic
 11 16 records, as appropriate, and to charge a fee for the provision
 11 17 of records and authentication of documents.
 11 18    A person who knowingly releases or discloses information
 11 19 from the database for a purpose other than those authorized in
 11 20 the bill or to a person who is not entitled to such information
 11 21 is guilty of a class "D" felony.
 11 22    The bill provides that the state and the department's
 11 23 designated agent are not liable to any person for gathering,
 11 24 managing, or using the information in the database in
 11 25 compliance with the bill.
 11 26    The bill provides for an effective date of July 1, 2016.

  9 14                           EXPLANATION
  9 15 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  9 16 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  9 17    This bill establishes a motor vehicle insurance verification
  9 18 program within the department of transportation.  The
  9 19 department is required to contract with a third party to act
  9 20 as the department's designated agent for administration of the
  9 21 program.
  9 22    The designated agent is required to establish and maintain a
  9 23 database containing information from insurers relating to motor
  9 24 vehicle insurance coverage for registered motor vehicles, motor
  9 25 vehicle identification information, personal identification
  9 26 information for registered owners of motor vehicles, and any
  9 27 other information provided to the designated agent by the
  9 28 department.
  9 29    At least twice a month, the designated agent shall update the
  9 30 database and compare current motor vehicle registrations with
  9 31 updated insurance information.  The files in the database shall
  9 32 be archived semiannually and audited by the department at least
  9 33 annually.  The bill requires the department to adopt rules for
  9 34 administration of the database.
  9 35    If database records show that a registered motor vehicle
 10  1 is not covered under an owner's policy of liability insurance
 10  2 for three months, the designated agent shall send a notice to
 10  3 the owner requiring the owner to respond within 15 days by
 10  4 providing proof of financial liability coverage or proof that
 10  5 the owner is exempt from the requirement to maintain financial
 10  6 liability coverage.  If the owner fails to respond, a second
 10  7 notice will be sent.  If the owner does not respond to the
 10  8 second notice, the owner's motor vehicle registration will be
 10  9 revoked by the department and the owner will be required to
 10 10 surrender the registration plates and registration receipt for
 10 11 the vehicle to the county treasurer.  In order to obtain a
 10 12 new registration for the vehicle, the owner must comply with
 10 13 financial responsibility requirements and pay an administrative
 10 14 fee of $100. The fees are to be used by the department
 10 15 exclusively to offset the costs of administering the program.
 10 16 Any fees in excess of the amount needed for administration of
 10 17 the program are to be transferred to the road use tax fund
 10 18 annually on June 30.
 10 19    The bill provides that if a motor vehicle is covered by a
 10 20 form of financial liability coverage other than an insurance
 10 21 policy, that fact shall be noted in the database.
 10 22    The bill prohibits a person from providing false or
 10 23 fraudulent information to the department or the department's
 10 24 designated agent in relation to the motor vehicle insurance
 10 25 verification program.  A violation is a simple misdemeanor.
 10 26    The bill requires each insurer that issues a policy that
 10 27 includes motor vehicle liability coverage, uninsured motorist
 10 28 coverage, underinsured motorist coverage, or personal injury
 10 29 coverage to the owner of a motor vehicle to provide, before the
 10 30 7th and the 21st of each month, to the department's designated
 10 31 agent a record of each motor vehicle insurance policy issued by
 10 32 the insurer and in effect for vehicles registered or garaged in
 10 33 this state as of the date of the previous submission. Vehicles
 10 34 subject to apportioned registration are not included in this
 10 35 requirement.  Insurers that fail to comply with the reporting
 11  1 requirement may be assessed a civil penalty of $250 per day.
 11  2 However, the department may waive the penalty upon a showing
 11  3 that the failure was inadvertent, accidental, or the result
 11  4 of excusable neglect. An insurer that discloses records to
 11  5 the department's designated agent in a reasonable, good=faith
 11  6 effort to comply with the bill is not subject to the penalty.
 11  7    Information contained in the database is confidential,
 11  8 but the bill provides exceptions for disclosures to state or
 11  9 local government agencies and courts for specified purposes;
 11 10 to individuals and certain other authorized persons; for
 11 11 purposes of an accident investigation; to law enforcement
 11 12 agencies and peace officers for certain official purposes;
 11 13 to the state auditor; and to financial institutions with a
 11 14 security interest in a motor vehicle.  The designated agent
 11 15 may be authorized to provide certified copies or electronic
 11 16 records, as appropriate, and to charge a fee for the provision
 11 17 of records and authentication of documents.
 11 18    A person who knowingly releases or discloses information
 11 19 from the database for a purpose other than those authorized in
 11 20 the bill or to a person who is not entitled to such information
 11 21 is guilty of a class "D" felony.
 11 22    The bill provides that the state and the department's
 11 23 designated agent are not liable to any person for gathering,
 11 24 managing, or using the information in the database in
 11 25 compliance with the bill.

  9 15 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  9 16 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  9 17    This bill establishes a motor vehicle insurance verification
  9 18 program within the department of transportation.  The
  9 19 department is required to contract with a third party to act
  9 20 as the department's designated agent for administration of the
  9 21 program.
  9 22    The designated agent is required to establish and maintain a
  9 23 database containing information from insurers relating to motor
  9 24 vehicle insurance coverage for registered motor vehicles, motor
  9 25 vehicle identification information, personal identification
  9 26 information for registered owners of motor vehicles, and any
  9 27 other information provided to the designated agent by the
  9 28 department.
  9 29    At least twice a month, the designated agent shall update the
  9 30 database and compare current motor vehicle registrations with
  9 31 updated insurance information.  The files in the database shall
  9 32 be archived semiannually and audited by the department at least
  9 33 annually.  The bill requires the department to adopt rules for
  9 34 administration of the database.
  9 35    If database records show that a registered motor vehicle
 10  1 is not covered under an owner's policy of liability insurance
 10  2 for three months, the designated agent shall send a notice to
 10  3 the owner requiring the owner to respond within 15 days by
 10  4 providing proof of financial liability coverage or proof that
 10  5 the owner is exempt from the requirement to maintain financial
 10  6 liability coverage.  If the owner fails to respond, a second
 10  7 notice will be sent.  If the owner does not respond to the
 10  8 second notice, the owner's motor vehicle registration will be
 10  9 revoked by the department and the owner will be required to
 10 10 surrender the registration plates and registration receipt for
 10 11 the vehicle to the county treasurer.  In order to obtain a
 10 12 new registration for the vehicle, the owner must comply with
 10 13 financial responsibility requirements and pay an administrative
 10 14 fee of $100. The fees are to be used by the department
 10 15 exclusively to offset the costs of administering the program.
 10 16 Any fees in excess of the amount needed for administration of
 10 17 the program are to be transferred to the road use tax fund
 10 18 annually on June 30.
 10 19    The bill provides that if a motor vehicle is covered by a

 10 21 policy, that fact shall be noted in the database.

 10 34 subject to apportioned registration are not included in this

 11  3 that the failure was inadvertent, accidental, or the result
 11  4 of excusable neglect. An insurer that discloses records to
 11  5 the department's designated agent in a reasonable, good=faith
 11  6 effort to comply with the bill is not subject to the penalty.
 11  7    Information contained in the database is confidential,
 11  8 but the bill provides exceptions for disclosures to state or
 11  9 local government agencies and courts for specified purposes;

 11 21 is guilty of a class "D" felony.

  9 19 department is required to contract with a third party to act
  9 20 as the department's designated agent for administration of the
  9 21 program.
  9 22    The designated agent is required to establish and maintain a
  9 23 database containing information from insurers relating to motor
  9 24 vehicle insurance coverage for registered motor vehicles, motor
  9 25 vehicle identification information, personal identification
  9 26 information for registered owners of motor vehicles, and any
  9 27 other information provided to the designated agent by the
  9 28 department.
  9 29    At least twice a month, the designated agent shall update the
  9 30 database and compare current motor vehicle registrations with
  9 31 updated insurance information.  The files in the database shall
  9 32 be archived semiannually and audited by the department at least
  9 33 annually.  The bill requires the department to adopt rules for
  9 34 administration of the database.
  9 35    If database records show that a registered motor vehicle
 10  1 is not covered under an owner's policy of liability insurance
 10  2 for three months, the designated agent shall send a notice to
 10  3 the owner requiring the owner to respond within 15 days by
 10  4 providing proof of financial liability coverage or proof that
 10  5 the owner is exempt from the requirement to maintain financial
 10  6 liability coverage.  If the owner fails to respond, a second
 10  7 notice will be sent.  If the owner does not respond to the
 10  8 second notice, the owner's motor vehicle registration will be
 10  9 revoked by the department and the owner will be required to
 10 10 surrender the registration plates and registration receipt for
 10 11 the vehicle to the county treasurer.  In order to obtain a
 10 12 new registration for the vehicle, the owner must comply with
 10 13 financial responsibility requirements and pay an administrative
 10 14 fee of $100. The fees are to be used by the department
 10 15 exclusively to offset the costs of administering the program.
 10 16 Any fees in excess of the amount needed for administration of
 10 17 the program are to be transferred to the road use tax fund
 10 18 annually on June 30.
 10 19    The bill provides that if a motor vehicle is covered by a
 10 20 form of financial liability coverage other than an insurance
 10 21 policy, that fact shall be noted in the database.
 10 22    The bill prohibits a person from providing false or
 10 23 fraudulent information to the department or the department's
 10 24 designated agent in relation to the motor vehicle insurance
 10 25 verification program.  A violation is a simple misdemeanor.
 10 26    The bill requires each insurer that issues a policy that
 10 27 includes motor vehicle liability coverage, uninsured motorist
 10 28 coverage, underinsured motorist coverage, or personal injury
 10 29 coverage to the owner of a motor vehicle to provide, before the
 10 30 7th and the 21st of each month, to the department's designated
 10 31 agent a record of each motor vehicle insurance policy issued by
 10 32 the insurer and in effect for vehicles registered or garaged in
 10 33 this state as of the date of the previous submission. Vehicles
 10 34 subject to apportioned registration are not included in this
 10 35 requirement.  Insurers that fail to comply with the reporting
 11  1 requirement may be assessed a civil penalty of $250 per day.
 11  2 However, the department may waive the penalty upon a showing
 11  3 that the failure was inadvertent, accidental, or the result
 11  4 of excusable neglect. An insurer that discloses records to
 11  5 the department's designated agent in a reasonable, good=faith
 11  6 effort to comply with the bill is not subject to the penalty.
 11  7    Information contained in the database is confidential,
 11  8 but the bill provides exceptions for disclosures to state or
 11  9 local government agencies and courts for specified purposes;
 11 10 to individuals and certain other authorized persons; for
 11 11 purposes of an accident investigation; to law enforcement
 11 12 agencies and peace officers for certain official purposes;
 11 13 to the state auditor; and to financial institutions with a
 11 14 security interest in a motor vehicle.  The designated agent
 11 15 may be authorized to provide certified copies or electronic
 11 16 records, as appropriate, and to charge a fee for the provision
 11 17 of records and authentication of documents.
 11 18    A person who knowingly releases or discloses information
 11 19 from the database for a purpose other than those authorized in
 11 20 the bill or to a person who is not entitled to such information
 11 21 is guilty of a class "D" felony.
 11 22    The bill provides that the state and the department's
 11 23 designated agent are not liable to any person for gathering,
 11 24 managing, or using the information in the database in
 11 25 compliance with the bill.
 11 26    The bill provides for an effective date of July 1, 2016.

  9 14                           EXPLANATION
  9 15 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  9 16 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  9 17    This bill establishes a motor vehicle insurance verification
  9 18 program within the department of transportation.  The
  9 19 department is required to contract with a third party to act
  9 20 as the department's designated agent for administration of the
  9 21 program.
  9 22    The designated agent is required to establish and maintain a
  9 23 database containing information from insurers relating to motor
  9 24 vehicle insurance coverage for registered motor vehicles, motor
  9 25 vehicle identification information, personal identification
  9 26 information for registered owners of motor vehicles, and any
  9 27 other information provided to the designated agent by the
  9 28 department.
  9 29    At least twice a month, the designated agent shall update the
  9 30 database and compare current motor vehicle registrations with
  9 31 updated insurance information.  The files in the database shall
  9 32 be archived semiannually and audited by the department at least
  9 33 annually.  The bill requires the department to adopt rules for
  9 34 administration of the database.
  9 35    If database records show that a registered motor vehicle
 10  1 is not covered under an owner's policy of liability insurance
 10  2 for three months, the designated agent shall send a notice to
 10  3 the owner requiring the owner to respond within 15 days by
 10  4 providing proof of financial liability coverage or proof that
 10  5 the owner is exempt from the requirement to maintain financial
 10  6 liability coverage.  If the owner fails to respond, a second
 10  7 notice will be sent.  If the owner does not respond to the
 10  8 second notice, the owner's motor vehicle registration will be
 10  9 revoked by the department and the owner will be required to
 10 10 surrender the registration plates and registration receipt for
 10 11 the vehicle to the county treasurer.  In order to obtain a
 10 12 new registration for the vehicle, the owner must comply with
 10 13 financial responsibility requirements and pay an administrative
 10 14 fee of $100. The fees are to be used by the department
 10 15 exclusively to offset the costs of administering the program.
 10 16 Any fees in excess of the amount needed for administration of
 10 17 the program are to be transferred to the road use tax fund
 10 18 annually on June 30.
 10 19    The bill provides that if a motor vehicle is covered by a
 10 20 form of financial liability coverage other than an insurance
 10 21 policy, that fact shall be noted in the database.
 10 22    The bill prohibits a person from providing false or
 10 23 fraudulent information to the department or the department's
 10 24 designated agent in relation to the motor vehicle insurance
 10 25 verification program.  A violation is a simple misdemeanor.
 10 26    The bill requires each insurer that issues a policy that
 10 27 includes motor vehicle liability coverage, uninsured motorist
 10 28 coverage, underinsured motorist coverage, or personal injury
 10 29 coverage to the owner of a motor vehicle to provide, before the
 10 30 7th and the 21st of each month, to the department's designated
 10 31 agent a record of each motor vehicle insurance policy issued by
 10 32 the insurer and in effect for vehicles registered or garaged in
 10 33 this state as of the date of the previous submission. Vehicles
 10 34 subject to apportioned registration are not included in this
 10 35 requirement.  Insurers that fail to comply with the reporting
 11  1 requirement may be assessed a civil penalty of $250 per day.
 11  2 However, the department may waive the penalty upon a showing
 11  3 that the failure was inadvertent, accidental, or the result
 11  4 of excusable neglect. An insurer that discloses records to
 11  5 the department's designated agent in a reasonable, good=faith
 11  6 effort to comply with the bill is not subject to the penalty.
 11  7    Information contained in the database is confidential,
 11  8 but the bill provides exceptions for disclosures to state or
 11  9 local government agencies and courts for specified purposes;
 11 10 to individuals and certain other authorized persons; for
 11 11 purposes of an accident investigation; to law enforcement
 11 12 agencies and peace officers for certain official purposes;
 11 13 to the state auditor; and to financial institutions with a
 11 14 security interest in a motor vehicle.  The designated agent
 11 15 may be authorized to provide certified copies or electronic
 11 16 records, as appropriate, and to charge a fee for the provision
 11 17 of records and authentication of documents.
 11 18    A person who knowingly releases or discloses information
 11 19 from the database for a purpose other than those authorized in
 11 20 the bill or to a person who is not entitled to such information
 11 21 is guilty of a class "D" felony.
 11 22    The bill provides that the state and the department's
 11 23 designated agent are not liable to any person for gathering,
 11 24 managing, or using the information in the database in
 11 25 compliance with the bill.
 11 26    The bill provides for an effective date of July 1, 2016.

  9 14                           EXPLANATION
  9 15 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  9 16 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  9 17    This bill establishes a motor vehicle insurance verification
  9 18 program within the department of transportation.  The
  9 19 department is required to contract with a third party to act
  9 20 as the department's designated agent for administration of the
  9 21 program.
  9 22    The designated agent is required to establish and maintain a
  9 23 database containing information from insurers relating to motor
  9 24 vehicle insurance coverage for registered motor vehicles, motor
  9 25 vehicle identification information, personal identification
  9 26 information for registered owners of motor vehicles, and any
  9 27 other information provided to the designated agent by the
  9 28 department.
  9 29    At least twice a month, the designated agent shall update the
  9 30 database and compare current motor vehicle registrations with
  9 31 updated insurance information.  The files in the database shall
  9 32 be archived semiannually and audited by the department at least
  9 33 annually.  The bill requires the department to adopt rules for
  9 34 administration of the database.
  9 35    If database records show that a registered motor vehicle
 10  1 is not covered under an owner's policy of liability insurance
 10  2 for three months, the designated agent shall send a notice to
 10  3 the owner requiring the owner to respond within 15 days by
 10  4 providing proof of financial liability coverage or proof that
 10  5 the owner is exempt from the requirement to maintain financial
 10  6 liability coverage.  If the owner fails to respond, a second
 10  7 notice will be sent.  If the owner does not respond to the
 10  8 second notice, the owner's motor vehicle registration will be
 10  9 revoked by the department and the owner will be required to
 10 10 surrender the registration plates and registration receipt for
 10 11 the vehicle to the county treasurer.  In order to obtain a
 10 12 new registration for the vehicle, the owner must comply with
 10 13 financial responsibility requirements and pay an administrative
 10 14 fee of $100. The fees are to be used by the department
 10 15 exclusively to offset the costs of administering the program.
 10 16 Any fees in excess of the amount needed for administration of
 10 17 the program are to be transferred to the road use tax fund
 10 18 annually on June 30.
 10 19    The bill provides that if a motor vehicle is covered by a
 10 20 form of financial liability coverage other than an insurance
 10 21 policy, that fact shall be noted in the database.
 10 22    The bill prohibits a person from providing false or
 10 23 fraudulent information to the department or the department's
 10 24 designated agent in relation to the motor vehicle insurance
 10 25 verification program.  A violation is a simple misdemeanor.
 10 26    The bill requires each insurer that issues a policy that
 10 27 includes motor vehicle liability coverage, uninsured motorist
 10 28 coverage, underinsured motorist coverage, or personal injury
 10 29 coverage to the owner of a motor vehicle to provide, before the
 10 30 7th and the 21st of each month, to the department's designated
 10 31 agent a record of each motor vehicle insurance policy issued by
 10 32 the insurer and in effect for vehicles registered or garaged in
 10 33 this state as of the date of the previous submission. Vehicles
 10 34 subject to apportioned registration are not included in this
 10 35 requirement.  Insurers that fail to comply with the reporting
 11  1 requirement may be assessed a civil penalty of $250 per day.
 11  2 However, the department may waive the penalty upon a showing
 11  3 that the failure was inadvertent, accidental, or the result
 11  4 of excusable neglect. An insurer that discloses records to
 11  5 the department's designated agent in a reasonable, good=faith
 11  6 effort to comply with the bill is not subject to the penalty.
 11  7    Information contained in the database is confidential,
 11  8 but the bill provides exceptions for disclosures to state or
 11  9 local government agencies and courts for specified purposes;
 11 10 to individuals and certain other authorized persons; for
 11 11 purposes of an accident investigation; to law enforcement
 11 12 agencies and peace officers for certain official purposes;
 11 13 to the state auditor; and to financial institutions with a
 11 14 security interest in a motor vehicle.  The designated agent
 11 15 may be authorized to provide certified copies or electronic
 11 16 records, as appropriate, and to charge a fee for the provision
 11 17 of records and authentication of documents.
 11 18    A person who knowingly releases or discloses information
 11 19 from the database for a purpose other than those authorized in
 11 20 the bill or to a person who is not entitled to such information
 11 21 is guilty of a class "D" felony.
 11 22    The bill provides that the state and the department's
 11 23 designated agent are not liable to any person for gathering,
 11 24 managing, or using the information in the database in
 11 25 compliance with the bill.
 11 26    The bill provides for an effective date of July 1, 2016.

  9 14                           EXPLANATION
  9 15 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  9 16 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  9 17    This bill establishes a motor vehicle insurance verification
  9 18 program within the department of transportation.  The
  9 19 department is required to contract with a third party to act
  9 20 as the department's designated agent for administration of the
  9 21 program.
  9 22    The designated agent is required to establish and maintain a
  9 23 database containing information from insurers relating to motor
  9 24 vehicle insurance coverage for registered motor vehicles, motor
  9 25 vehicle identification information, personal identification
  9 26 information for registered owners of motor vehicles, and any
  9 27 other information provided to the designated agent by the
  9 28 department.
  9 29    At least twice a month, the designated agent shall update the
  9 30 database and compare current motor vehicle registrations with
  9 31 updated insurance information.  The files in the database shall
  9 32 be archived semiannually and audited by the department at least
  9 33 annually.  The bill requires the department to adopt rules for
  9 34 administration of the database.
  9 35    If database records show that a registered motor vehicle
 10  1 is not covered under an owner's policy of liability insurance
 10  2 for three months, the designated agent shall send a notice to
 10  3 the owner requiring the owner to respond within 15 days by
 10  4 providing proof of financial liability coverage or proof that
 10  5 the owner is exempt from the requirement to maintain financial
 10  6 liability coverage.  If the owner fails to respond, a second
 10  7 notice will be sent.  If the owner does not respond to the
 10  8 second notice, the owner's motor vehicle registration will be
 10  9 revoked by the department and the owner will be required to
 10 10 surrender the registration plates and registration receipt for
 10 11 the vehicle to the county treasurer.  In order to obtain a
 10 12 new registration for the vehicle, the owner must comply with
 10 13 financial responsibility requirements and pay an administrative
 10 14 fee of $100. The fees are to be used by the department
 10 15 exclusively to offset the costs of administering the program.
 10 16 Any fees in excess of the amount needed for administration of
 10 17 the program are to be transferred to the road use tax fund
 10 18 annually on June 30.
 10 19    The bill provides that if a motor vehicle is covered by a
 10 20 form of financial liability coverage other than an insurance
 10 21 policy, that fact shall be noted in the database.
 10 22    The bill prohibits a person from providing false or
 10 23 fraudulent information to the department or the department's
 10 24 designated agent in relation to the motor vehicle insurance
 10 25 verification program.  A violation is a simple misdemeanor.
 10 26    The bill requires each insurer that issues a policy that
 10 27 includes motor vehicle liability coverage, uninsured motorist
 10 28 coverage, underinsured motorist coverage, or personal injury
 10 29 coverage to the owner of a motor vehicle to provide, before the
 10 30 7th and the 21st of each month, to the department's designated
 10 31 agent a record of each motor vehicle insurance policy issued by
 10 32 the insurer and in effect for vehicles registered or garaged in
 10 33 this state as of the date of the previous submission. Vehicles
 10 34 subject to apportioned registration are not included in this
 10 35 requirement.  Insurers that fail to comply with the reporting
 11  1 requirement may be assessed a civil penalty of $250 per day.
 11  2 However, the department may waive the penalty upon a showing
 11  3 that the failure was inadvertent, accidental, or the result
 11  4 of excusable neglect. An insurer that discloses records to
 11  5 the department's designated agent in a reasonable, good=faith
 11  6 effort to comply with the bill is not subject to the penalty.
 11  7    Information contained in the database is confidential,
 11  8 but the bill provides exceptions for disclosures to state or
 11  9 local government agencies and courts for specified purposes;
 11 10 to individuals and certain other authorized persons; for
 11 11 purposes of an accident investigation; to law enforcement
 11 12 agencies and peace officers for certain official purposes;
 11 13 to the state auditor; and to financial institutions with a
 11 14 security interest in a motor vehicle.  The designated agent
 11 15 may be authorized to provide certified copies or electronic
 11 16 records, as appropriate, and to charge a fee for the provision
 11 17 of records and authentication of documents.
 11 18    A person who knowingly releases or discloses information
 11 19 from the database for a purpose other than those authorized in
 11 20 the bill or to a person who is not entitled to such information
 11 21 is guilty of a class "D" felony.
 11 22    The bill provides that the state and the department's
 11 23 designated agent are not liable to any person for gathering,
 11 24 managing, or using the information in the database in
 11 25 compliance with the bill.
 11 26    The bill provides for an effective date of July 1, 2016.

  9 14                           EXPLANATION
  9 15 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  9 16 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  9 17    This bill establishes a motor vehicle insurance verification
  9 18 program within the department of transportation.  The
  9 19 department is required to contract with a third party to act
  9 20 as the department's designated agent for administration of the
  9 21 program.
  9 22    The designated agent is required to establish and maintain a
  9 23 database containing information from insurers relating to motor
  9 24 vehicle insurance coverage for registered motor vehicles, motor
  9 25 vehicle identification information, personal identification
  9 26 information for registered owners of motor vehicles, and any
  9 27 other information provided to the designated agent by the
  9 28 department.
  9 29    At least twice a month, the designated agent shall update the
  9 30 database and compare current motor vehicle registrations with
  9 31 updated insurance information.  The files in the database shall
  9 32 be archived semiannually and audited by the department at least
  9 33 annually.  The bill requires the department to adopt rules for
  9 34 administration of the database.
  9 35    If database records show that a registered motor vehicle
 10  1 is not covered under an owner's policy of liability insurance
 10  2 for three months, the designated agent shall send a notice to
 10  3 the owner requiring the owner to respond within 15 days by
 10  4 providing proof of financial liability coverage or proof that
 10  5 the owner is exempt from the requirement to maintain financial
 10  6 liability coverage.  If the owner fails to respond, a second
 10  7 notice will be sent.  If the owner does not respond to the
 10  8 second notice, the owner's motor vehicle registration will be
 10  9 revoked by the department and the owner will be required to
 10 10 surrender the registration plates and registration receipt for
 10 11 the vehicle to the county treasurer.  In order to obtain a
 10 12 new registration for the vehicle, the owner must comply with
 10 13 financial responsibility requirements and pay an administrative
 10 14 fee of $100. The fees are to be used by the department
 10 15 exclusively to offset the costs of administering the program.
 10 16 Any fees in excess of the amount needed for administration of
 10 17 the program are to be transferred to the road use tax fund
 10 18 annually on June 30.
 10 19    The bill provides that if a motor vehicle is covered by a
 10 20 form of financial liability coverage other than an insurance
 10 21 policy, that fact shall be noted in the database.
 10 22    The bill prohibits a person from providing false or
 10 23 fraudulent information to the department or the department's
 10 24 designated agent in relation to the motor vehicle insurance
 10 25 verification program.  A violation is a simple misdemeanor.
 10 26    The bill requires each insurer that issues a policy that
 10 27 includes motor vehicle liability coverage, uninsured motorist
 10 28 coverage, underinsured motorist coverage, or personal injury
 10 29 coverage to the owner of a motor vehicle to provide, before the
 10 30 7th and the 21st of each month, to the department's designated
 10 31 agent a record of each motor vehicle insurance policy issued by
 10 32 the insurer and in effect for vehicles registered or garaged in
 10 33 this state as of the date of the previous submission. Vehicles
 10 34 subject to apportioned registration are not included in this
 10 35 requirement.  Insurers that fail to comply with the reporting
 11  1 requirement may be assessed a civil penalty of $250 per day.
 11  2 However, the department may waive the penalty upon a showing
 11  3 that the failure was inadvertent, accidental, or the result
 11  4 of excusable neglect. An insurer that discloses records to
 11  5 the department's designated agent in a reasonable, good=faith
 11  6 effort to comply with the bill is not subject to the penalty.
 11  7    Information contained in the database is confidential,
 11  8 but the bill provides exceptions for disclosures to state or
 11  9 local government agencies and courts for specified purposes;
 11 10 to individuals and certain other authorized persons; for
 11 11 purposes of an accident investigation; to law enforcement
 11 12 agencies and peace officers for certain official purposes;
 11 13 to the state auditor; and to financial institutions with a
 11 14 security interest in a motor vehicle.  The designated agent
 11 15 may be authorized to provide certified copies or electronic
 11 16 records, as appropriate, and to charge a fee for the provision
 11 17 of records and authentication of documents.
 11 18    A person who knowingly releases or discloses information
 11 19 from the database for a purpose other than those authorized in
 11 20 the bill or to a person who is not entitled to such information
 11 21 is guilty of a class "D" felony.
 11 22    The bill provides that the state and the department's
 11 23 designated agent are not liable to any person for gathering,
 11 24 managing, or using the information in the database in
 11 25 compliance with the bill.
 11 26    The bill provides for an effective date of July 1, 2016.

  9 14                           EXPLANATION
  9 15 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  9 16 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  9 17    This bill establishes a motor vehicle insurance verification
  9 18 program within the department of transportation.  The
  9 19 department is required to contract with a third party to act
  9 20 as the department's designated agent for administration of the
  9 21 program.
  9 22    The designated agent is required to establish and maintain a
  9 23 database containing information from insurers relating to motor
  9 24 vehicle insurance coverage for registered motor vehicles, motor
  9 25 vehicle identification information, personal identification
  9 26 information for registered owners of motor vehicles, and any
  9 27 other information provided to the designated agent by the
  9 28 department.
  9 29    At least twice a month, the designated agent shall update the
  9 30 database and compare current motor vehicle registrations with
  9 31 updated insurance information.  The files in the database shall
  9 32 be archived semiannually and audited by the department at least
  9 33 annually.  The bill requires the department to adopt rules for
  9 34 administration of the database.
  9 35    If database records show that a registered motor vehicle
 10  1 is not covered under an owner's policy of liability insurance
 10  2 for three months, the designated agent shall send a notice to
 10  3 the owner requiring the owner to respond within 15 days by
 10  4 providing proof of financial liability coverage or proof that
 10  5 the owner is exempt from the requirement to maintain financial
 10  6 liability coverage.  If the owner fails to respond, a second
 10  7 notice will be sent.  If the owner does not respond to the
 10  8 second notice, the owner's motor vehicle registration will be
 10  9 revoked by the department and the owner will be required to
 10 10 surrender the registration plates and registration receipt for
 10 11 the vehicle to the county treasurer.  In order to obtain a
 10 12 new registration for the vehicle, the owner must comply with
 10 13 financial responsibility requirements and pay an administrative
 10 14 fee of $100. The fees are to be used by the department
 10 15 exclusively to offset the costs of administering the program.
 10 16 Any fees in excess of the amount needed for administration of
 10 17 the program are to be transferred to the road use tax fund
 10 18 annually on June 30.
 10 19    The bill provides that if a motor vehicle is covered by a
 10 20 form of financial liability coverage other than an insurance
 10 21 policy, that fact shall be noted in the database.
 10 22    The bill prohibits a person from providing false or
 10 23 fraudulent information to the department or the department's
 10 24 designated agent in relation to the motor vehicle insurance
 10 25 verification program.  A violation is a simple misdemeanor.
 10 26    The bill requires each insurer that issues a policy that
 10 27 includes motor vehicle liability coverage, uninsured motorist
 10 28 coverage, underinsured motorist coverage, or personal injury
 10 29 coverage to the owner of a motor vehicle to provide, before the
 10 30 7th and the 21st of each month, to the department's designated
 10 31 agent a record of each motor vehicle insurance policy issued by
 10 32 the insurer and in effect for vehicles registered or garaged in
 10 33 this state as of the date of the previous submission. Vehicles
 10 34 subject to apportioned registration are not included in this
 10 35 requirement.  Insurers that fail to comply with the reporting
 11  1 requirement may be assessed a civil penalty of $250 per day.
 11  2 However, the department may waive the penalty upon a showing
 11  3 that the failure was inadvertent, accidental, or the result
 11  4 of excusable neglect. An insurer that discloses records to
 11  5 the department's designated agent in a reasonable, good=faith
 11  6 effort to comply with the bill is not subject to the penalty.
 11  7    Information contained in the database is confidential,
 11  8 but the bill provides exceptions for disclosures to state or
 11  9 local government agencies and courts for specified purposes;
 11 10 to individuals and certain other authorized persons; for
 11 11 purposes of an accident investigation; to law enforcement
 11 12 agencies and peace officers for certain official purposes;
 11 13 to the state auditor; and to financial institutions with a
 11 14 security interest in a motor vehicle.  The designated agent
 11 15 may be authorized to provide certified copies or electronic
 11 16 records, as appropriate, and to charge a fee for the provision
 11 17 of records and authentication of documents.
 11 18    A person who knowingly releases or discloses information
 11 19 from the database for a purpose other than those authorized in
 11 20 the bill or to a person who is not entitled to such information
 11 21 is guilty of a class "D" felony.
 11 22    The bill provides that the state and the department's
 11 23 designated agent are not liable to any person for gathering,
 11 24 managing, or using the information in the database in
 11 25 compliance with the bill.
 11 26    The bill provides for an effective date of July 1, 2016.

  9 14                           EXPLANATION
  9 15 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  9 16 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  9 17    This bill establishes a motor vehicle insurance verification
  9 18 program within the department of transportation.  The
  9 19 department is required to contract with a third party to act
  9 20 as the department's designated agent for administration of the
  9 21 program.
  9 22    The designated agent is required to establish and maintain a
  9 23 database containing information from insurers relating to motor
  9 24 vehicle insurance coverage for registered motor vehicles, motor
  9 25 vehicle identification information, personal identification
  9 26 information for registered owners of motor vehicles, and any
  9 27 other information provided to the designated agent by the
  9 28 department.
  9 29    At least twice a month, the designated agent shall update the
  9 30 database and compare current motor vehicle registrations with
  9 31 updated insurance information.  The files in the database shall
  9 32 be archived semiannually and audited by the department at least
  9 33 annually.  The bill requires the department to adopt rules for
  9 34 administration of the database.
  9 35    If database records show that a registered motor vehicle
 10  1 is not covered under an owner's policy of liability insurance
 10  2 for three months, the designated agent shall send a notice to
 10  3 the owner requiring the owner to respond within 15 days by
 10  4 providing proof of financial liability coverage or proof that
 10  5 the owner is exempt from the requirement to maintain financial
 10  6 liability coverage.  If the owner fails to respond, a second
 10  7 notice will be sent.  If the owner does not respond to the
 10  8 second notice, the owner's motor vehicle registration will be
 10  9 revoked by the department and the owner will be required to
 10 10 surrender the registration plates and registration receipt for
 10 11 the vehicle to the county treasurer.  In order to obtain a
 10 12 new registration for the vehicle, the owner must comply with
 10 13 financial responsibility requirements and pay an administrative
 10 14 fee of $100. The fees are to be used by the department
 10 15 exclusively to offset the costs of administering the program.
 10 16 Any fees in excess of the amount needed for administration of
 10 17 the program are to be transferred to the road use tax fund
 10 18 annually on June 30.
 10 19    The bill provides that if a motor vehicle is covered by a
 10 20 form of financial liability coverage other than an insurance
 10 21 policy, that fact shall be noted in the database.
 10 22    The bill prohibits a person from providing false or
 10 23 fraudulent information to the department or the department's
 10 24 designated agent in relation to the motor vehicle insurance
 10 25 verification program.  A violation is a simple misdemeanor.
 10 26    The bill requires each insurer that issues a policy that
 10 27 includes motor vehicle liability coverage, uninsured motorist
 10 28 coverage, underinsured motorist coverage, or personal injury
 10 29 coverage to the owner of a motor vehicle to provide, before the
 10 30 7th and the 21st of each month, to the department's designated
 10 31 agent a record of each motor vehicle insurance policy issued by
 10 32 the insurer and in effect for vehicles registered or garaged in
 10 33 this state as of the date of the previous submission. Vehicles
 10 34 subject to apportioned registration are not included in this
 10 35 requirement.  Insurers that fail to comply with the reporting
 11  1 requirement may be assessed a civil penalty of $250 per day.
 11  2 However, the department may waive the penalty upon a showing
 11  3 that the failure was inadvertent, accidental, or the result
 11  4 of excusable neglect. An insurer that discloses records to
 11  5 the department's designated agent in a reasonable, good=faith
 11  6 effort to comply with the bill is not subject to the penalty.
 11  7    Information contained in the database is confidential,
 11  8 but the bill provides exceptions for disclosures to state or
 11  9 local government agencies and courts for specified purposes;
 11 10 to individuals and certain other authorized persons; for
 11 11 purposes of an accident investigation; to law enforcement
 11 12 agencies and peace officers for certain official purposes;
 11 13 to the state auditor; and to financial institutions with a
 11 14 security interest in a motor vehicle.  The designated agent
 11 15 may be authorized to provide certified copies or electronic
 11 16 records, as appropriate, and to charge a fee for the provision
 11 17 of records and authentication of documents.
 11 18    A person who knowingly releases or discloses information
 11 19 from the database for a purpose other than those authorized in
 11 20 the bill or to a person who is not entitled to such information
 11 21 is guilty of a class "D" felony.
 11 22    The bill provides that the state and the department's
 11 23 designated agent are not liable to any person for gathering,
 11 24 managing, or using the information in the database in
 11 25 compliance with the bill.
 11 26    The bill provides for an effective date of July 1, 2016.

 10  6 liability coverage.  If the owner fails to respond, a second
 10  7 notice will be sent.  If the owner does not respond to the
 10  8 second notice, the owner's motor vehicle registration will be
 10  9 revoked by the department and the owner will be required to
 10 10 surrender the registration plates and registration receipt for
 10 11 the vehicle to the county treasurer.  In order to obtain a
 10 12 new registration for the vehicle, the owner must comply with
 10 13 financial responsibility requirements and pay an administrative
 10 14 fee of $100. The fees are to be used by the department
 10 15 exclusively to offset the costs of administering the program.
 10 16 Any fees in excess of the amount needed for administration of
 10 17 the program are to be transferred to the road use tax fund
 10 18 annually on June 30.
 10 19    The bill provides that if a motor vehicle is covered by a
 10 20 form of financial liability coverage other than an insurance
 10 21 policy, that fact shall be noted in the database.
 10 22    The bill prohibits a person from providing false or
 10 23 fraudulent information to the department or the department's
 10 24 designated agent in relation to the motor vehicle insurance
 10 25 verification program.  A violation is a simple misdemeanor.
 10 26    The bill requires each insurer that issues a policy that
 10 27 includes motor vehicle liability coverage, uninsured motorist
 10 28 coverage, underinsured motorist coverage, or personal injury
 10 29 coverage to the owner of a motor vehicle to provide, before the
 10 30 7th and the 21st of each month, to the department's designated
 10 31 agent a record of each motor vehicle insurance policy issued by
 10 32 the insurer and in effect for vehicles registered or garaged in
 10 33 this state as of the date of the previous submission. Vehicles
 10 34 subject to apportioned registration are not included in this
 10 35 requirement.  Insurers that fail to comply with the reporting
 11  1 requirement may be assessed a civil penalty of $250 per day.
 11  2 However, the department may waive the penalty upon a showing
 11  3 that the failure was inadvertent, accidental, or the result
 11  4 of excusable neglect. An insurer that discloses records to
 11  5 the department's designated agent in a reasonable, good=faith
 11  6 effort to comply with the bill is not subject to the penalty.
 11  7    Information contained in the database is confidential,
 11  8 but the bill provides exceptions for disclosures to state or
 11  9 local government agencies and courts for specified purposes;
 11 10 to individuals and certain other authorized persons; for
 11 11 purposes of an accident investigation; to law enforcement
 11 12 agencies and peace officers for certain official purposes;
 11 13 to the state auditor; and to financial institutions with a
 11 14 security interest in a motor vehicle.  The designated agent
 11 15 may be authorized to provide certified copies or electronic
 11 16 records, as appropriate, and to charge a fee for the provision
 11 17 of records and authentication of documents.
 11 18    A person who knowingly releases or discloses information
 11 19 from the database for a purpose other than those authorized in
 11 20 the bill or to a person who is not entitled to such information
 11 21 is guilty of a class "D" felony.
 11 22    The bill provides that the state and the department's
 11 23 designated agent are not liable to any person for gathering,
 11 24 managing, or using the information in the database in
 11 25 compliance with the bill.
 11 26    The bill provides for an effective date of July 1, 2016.

  9 15 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  9 16 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  9 17    This bill establishes a motor vehicle insurance verification
  9 18 program within the department of transportation.  The
  9 19 department is required to contract with a third party to act
  9 20 as the department's designated agent for administration of the
  9 21 program.
  9 22    The designated agent is required to establish and maintain a
  9 23 database containing information from insurers relating to motor
  9 24 vehicle insurance coverage for registered motor vehicles, motor
  9 25 vehicle identification information, personal identification
  9 26 information for registered owners of motor vehicles, and any
  9 27 other information provided to the designated agent by the
  9 28 department.
  9 29    At least twice a month, the designated agent shall update the
  9 30 database and compare current motor vehicle registrations with
  9 31 updated insurance information.  The files in the database shall
  9 32 be archived semiannually and audited by the department at least
  9 33 annually.  The bill requires the department to adopt rules for
  9 34 administration of the database.
  9 35    If database records show that a registered motor vehicle
 10  1 is not covered under an owner's policy of liability insurance
 10  2 for three months, the designated agent shall send a notice to
 10  3 the owner requiring the owner to respond within 15 days by
 10  4 providing proof of financial liability coverage or proof that
 10  5 the owner is exempt from the requirement to maintain financial
 10  6 liability coverage.  If the owner fails to respond, a second
 10  7 notice will be sent.  If the owner does not respond to the
 10  8 second notice, the owner's motor vehicle registration will be
 10  9 revoked by the department and the owner will be required to
 10 10 surrender the registration plates and registration receipt for
 10 11 the vehicle to the county treasurer.  In order to obtain a
 10 12 new registration for the vehicle, the owner must comply with
 10 13 financial responsibility requirements and pay an administrative
 10 14 fee of $100. The fees are to be used by the department
 10 15 exclusively to offset the costs of administering the program.
 10 16 Any fees in excess of the amount needed for administration of
 10 17 the program are to be transferred to the road use tax fund
 10 18 annually on June 30.
 10 19    The bill provides that if a motor vehicle is covered by a
 10 20 form of financial liability coverage other than an insurance
 10 21 policy, that fact shall be noted in the database.
 10 22    The bill prohibits a person from providing false or
 10 23 fraudulent information to the department or the department's
 10 24 designated agent in relation to the motor vehicle insurance
 10 25 verification program.  A violation is a simple misdemeanor.
 10 26    The bill requires each insurer that issues a policy that
 10 27 includes motor vehicle liability coverage, uninsured motorist
 10 28 coverage, underinsured motorist coverage, or personal injury
 10 29 coverage to the owner of a motor vehicle to provide, before the
 10 30 7th and the 21st of each month, to the department's designated

 10 34 subject to apportioned registration are not included in this
 10 35 requirement.  Insurers that fail to comply with the reporting
 11  1 requirement may be assessed a civil penalty of $250 per day.
 11  2 However, the department may waive the penalty upon a showing
 11  3 that the failure was inadvertent, accidental, or the result
 11  4 of excusable neglect. An insurer that discloses records to
 11  5 the department's designated agent in a reasonable, good=faith
 11  6 effort to comply with the bill is not subject to the penalty.
 11  7    Information contained in the database is confidential,

  9 14                           EXPLANATION
  9 15 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  9 16 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  9 17    This bill establishes a motor vehicle insurance verification
  9 18 program within the department of transportation.  The
  9 19 department is required to contract with a third party to act
  9 20 as the department's designated agent for administration of the
  9 21 program.
  9 22    The designated agent is required to establish and maintain a
  9 23 database containing information from insurers relating to motor
  9 24 vehicle insurance coverage for registered motor vehicles, motor
  9 25 vehicle identification information, personal identification
  9 26 information for registered owners of motor vehicles, and any
  9 27 other information provided to the designated agent by the
  9 28 department.
  9 29    At least twice a month, the designated agent shall update the
  9 30 database and compare current motor vehicle registrations with
  9 31 updated insurance information.  The files in the database shall
  9 32 be archived semiannually and audited by the department at least
  9 33 annually.  The bill requires the department to adopt rules for
  9 34 administration of the database.
  9 35    If database records show that a registered motor vehicle
 10  1 is not covered under an owner's policy of liability insurance
 10  2 for three months, the designated agent shall send a notice to
 10  3 the owner requiring the owner to respond within 15 days by
 10  4 providing proof of financial liability coverage or proof that
 10  5 the owner is exempt from the requirement to maintain financial
 10  6 liability coverage.  If the owner fails to respond, a second
 10  7 notice will be sent.  If the owner does not respond to the
 10  8 second notice, the owner's motor vehicle registration will be
 10  9 revoked by the department and the owner will be required to
 10 10 surrender the registration plates and registration receipt for
 10 11 the vehicle to the county treasurer.  In order to obtain a
 10 12 new registration for the vehicle, the owner must comply with
 10 13 financial responsibility requirements and pay an administrative
 10 14 fee of $100. The fees are to be used by the department
 10 15 exclusively to offset the costs of administering the program.
 10 16 Any fees in excess of the amount needed for administration of
 10 17 the program are to be transferred to the road use tax fund
 10 18 annually on June 30.
 10 19    The bill provides that if a motor vehicle is covered by a
 10 20 form of financial liability coverage other than an insurance
 10 21 policy, that fact shall be noted in the database.
 10 22    The bill prohibits a person from providing false or
 10 23 fraudulent information to the department or the department's
 10 24 designated agent in relation to the motor vehicle insurance
 10 25 verification program.  A violation is a simple misdemeanor.
 10 26    The bill requires each insurer that issues a policy that
 10 27 includes motor vehicle liability coverage, uninsured motorist
 10 28 coverage, underinsured motorist coverage, or personal injury
 10 29 coverage to the owner of a motor vehicle to provide, before the
 10 30 7th and the 21st of each month, to the department's designated
 10 31 agent a record of each motor vehicle insurance policy issued by
 10 32 the insurer and in effect for vehicles registered or garaged in
 10 33 this state as of the date of the previous submission. Vehicles
 10 34 subject to apportioned registration are not included in this
 10 35 requirement.  Insurers that fail to comply with the reporting
 11  1 requirement may be assessed a civil penalty of $250 per day.
 11  2 However, the department may waive the penalty upon a showing
 11  3 that the failure was inadvertent, accidental, or the result
 11  4 of excusable neglect. An insurer that discloses records to
 11  5 the department's designated agent in a reasonable, good=faith
 11  6 effort to comply with the bill is not subject to the penalty.
 11  7    Information contained in the database is confidential,
 11  8 but the bill provides exceptions for disclosures to state or
 11  9 local government agencies and courts for specified purposes;
 11 10 to individuals and certain other authorized persons; for
 11 11 purposes of an accident investigation; to law enforcement
 11 12 agencies and peace officers for certain official purposes;
 11 13 to the state auditor; and to financial institutions with a
 11 14 security interest in a motor vehicle.  The designated agent
 11 15 may be authorized to provide certified copies or electronic
 11 16 records, as appropriate, and to charge a fee for the provision
 11 17 of records and authentication of documents.
 11 18    A person who knowingly releases or discloses information
 11 19 from the database for a purpose other than those authorized in
 11 20 the bill or to a person who is not entitled to such information
 11 21 is guilty of a class "D" felony.
 11 22    The bill provides that the state and the department's
 11 23 designated agent are not liable to any person for gathering,
 11 24 managing, or using the information in the database in
 11 25 compliance with the bill.
 11 26    The bill provides for an effective date of July 1, 2016.

  9 15 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  9 16 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  9 17    This bill establishes a motor vehicle insurance verification
  9 18 program within the department of transportation.  The
  9 19 department is required to contract with a third party to act
  9 20 as the department's designated agent for administration of the
  9 21 program.
  9 22    The designated agent is required to establish and maintain a
  9 23 database containing information from insurers relating to motor
  9 24 vehicle insurance coverage for registered motor vehicles, motor
  9 25 vehicle identification information, personal identification
  9 26 information for registered owners of motor vehicles, and any
  9 27 other information provided to the designated agent by the
  9 28 department.
  9 29    At least twice a month, the designated agent shall update the
  9 30 database and compare current motor vehicle registrations with
  9 31 updated insurance information.  The files in the database shall
  9 32 be archived semiannually and audited by the department at least
  9 33 annually.  The bill requires the department to adopt rules for
  9 34 administration of the database.
  9 35    If database records show that a registered motor vehicle
 10  1 is not covered under an owner's policy of liability insurance
 10  2 for three months, the designated agent shall send a notice to
 10  3 the owner requiring the owner to respond within 15 days by
 10  4 providing proof of financial liability coverage or proof that
 10  5 the owner is exempt from the requirement to maintain financial
 10  6 liability coverage.  If the owner fails to respond, a second
 10  7 notice will be sent.  If the owner does not respond to the
 10  8 second notice, the owner's motor vehicle registration will be
 10  9 revoked by the department and the owner will be required to
 10 10 surrender the registration plates and registration receipt for
 10 11 the vehicle to the county treasurer.  In order to obtain a
 10 12 new registration for the vehicle, the owner must comply with
 10 13 financial responsibility requirements and pay an administrative
 10 14 fee of $100. The fees are to be used by the department
 10 15 exclusively to offset the costs of administering the program.
 10 16 Any fees in excess of the amount needed for administration of
 10 17 the program are to be transferred to the road use tax fund
 10 18 annually on June 30.
 10 19    The bill provides that if a motor vehicle is covered by a
 10 20 form of financial liability coverage other than an insurance
 10 21 policy, that fact shall be noted in the database.
 10 22    The bill prohibits a person from providing false or
 10 23 fraudulent information to the department or the department's
 10 24 designated agent in relation to the motor vehicle insurance
 10 25 verification program.  A violation is a simple misdemeanor.
 10 26    The bill requires each insurer that issues a policy that
 10 27 includes motor vehicle liability coverage, uninsured motorist
 10 28 coverage, underinsured motorist coverage, or personal injury
 10 29 coverage to the owner of a motor vehicle to provide, before the
 10 30 7th and the 21st of each month, to the department's designated
 10 31 agent a record of each motor vehicle insurance policy issued by
 10 32 the insurer and in effect for vehicles registered or garaged in
 10 33 this state as of the date of the previous submission. Vehicles
 10 34 subject to apportioned registration are not included in this
 10 35 requirement.  Insurers that fail to comply with the reporting
 11  1 requirement may be assessed a civil penalty of $250 per day.
 11  2 However, the department may waive the penalty upon a showing
 11  3 that the failure was inadvertent, accidental, or the result
 11  4 of excusable neglect. An insurer that discloses records to
 11  5 the department's designated agent in a reasonable, good=faith
 11  6 effort to comply with the bill is not subject to the penalty.
 11  7    Information contained in the database is confidential,
 11  8 but the bill provides exceptions for disclosures to state or
 11  9 local government agencies and courts for specified purposes;
 11 10 to individuals and certain other authorized persons; for
 11 11 purposes of an accident investigation; to law enforcement
 11 12 agencies and peace officers for certain official purposes;
 11 13 to the state auditor; and to financial institutions with a
 11 14 security interest in a motor vehicle.  The designated agent
 11 15 may be authorized to provide certified copies or electronic
 11 16 records, as appropriate, and to charge a fee for the provision
 11 17 of records and authentication of documents.
 11 18    A person who knowingly releases or discloses information
 11 19 from the database for a purpose other than those authorized in
 11 20 the bill or to a person who is not entitled to such information
 11 21 is guilty of a class "D" felony.
 11 22    The bill provides that the state and the department's
 11 23 designated agent are not liable to any person for gathering,
 11 24 managing, or using the information in the database in
 11 25 compliance with the bill.

  9 13    Sec. 8.  EFFECTIVE DATE.  This Act takes effect July 1, 2016.
  9 14                           EXPLANATION
  9 15 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  9 16 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  9 17    This bill establishes a motor vehicle insurance verification
  9 18 program within the department of transportation.  The
  9 19 department is required to contract with a third party to act
  9 20 as the department's designated agent for administration of the
  9 21 program.
  9 22    The designated agent is required to establish and maintain a
  9 23 database containing information from insurers relating to motor
  9 24 vehicle insurance coverage for registered motor vehicles, motor
  9 25 vehicle identification information, personal identification
  9 26 information for registered owners of motor vehicles, and any
  9 27 other information provided to the designated agent by the
  9 28 department.
  9 29    At least twice a month, the designated agent shall update the
  9 30 database and compare current motor vehicle registrations with
  9 31 updated insurance information.  The files in the database shall
  9 32 be archived semiannually and audited by the department at least
  9 33 annually.  The bill requires the department to adopt rules for
  9 34 administration of the database.
  9 35    If database records show that a registered motor vehicle
 10  1 is not covered under an owner's policy of liability insurance
 10  2 for three months, the designated agent shall send a notice to
 10  3 the owner requiring the owner to respond within 15 days by
 10  4 providing proof of financial liability coverage or proof that
 10  5 the owner is exempt from the requirement to maintain financial
 10  6 liability coverage.  If the owner fails to respond, a second
 10  7 notice will be sent.  If the owner does not respond to the
 10  8 second notice, the owner's motor vehicle registration will be
 10  9 revoked by the department and the owner will be required to
 10 10 surrender the registration plates and registration receipt for
 10 11 the vehicle to the county treasurer.  In order to obtain a
 10 12 new registration for the vehicle, the owner must comply with
 10 13 financial responsibility requirements and pay an administrative
 10 14 fee of $100. The fees are to be used by the department
 10 15 exclusively to offset the costs of administering the program.
 10 16 Any fees in excess of the amount needed for administration of
 10 17 the program are to be transferred to the road use tax fund
 10 18 annually on June 30.
 10 19    The bill provides that if a motor vehicle is covered by a
 10 20 form of financial liability coverage other than an insurance
 10 21 policy, that fact shall be noted in the database.
 10 22    The bill prohibits a person from providing false or
 10 23 fraudulent information to the department or the department's
 10 24 designated agent in relation to the motor vehicle insurance
 10 25 verification program.  A violation is a simple misdemeanor.
 10 26    The bill requires each insurer that issues a policy that
 10 27 includes motor vehicle liability coverage, uninsured motorist
 10 28 coverage, underinsured motorist coverage, or personal injury
 10 29 coverage to the owner of a motor vehicle to provide, before the
 10 30 7th and the 21st of each month, to the department's designated
 10 31 agent a record of each motor vehicle insurance policy issued by
 10 32 the insurer and in effect for vehicles registered or garaged in
 10 33 this state as of the date of the previous submission. Vehicles
 10 34 subject to apportioned registration are not included in this
 10 35 requirement.  Insurers that fail to comply with the reporting
 11  1 requirement may be assessed a civil penalty of $250 per day.
 11  2 However, the department may waive the penalty upon a showing
 11  3 that the failure was inadvertent, accidental, or the result
 11  4 of excusable neglect. An insurer that discloses records to
 11  5 the department's designated agent in a reasonable, good=faith
 11  6 effort to comply with the bill is not subject to the penalty.
 11  7    Information contained in the database is confidential,
 11  8 but the bill provides exceptions for disclosures to state or
 11  9 local government agencies and courts for specified purposes;
 11 10 to individuals and certain other authorized persons; for
 11 11 purposes of an accident investigation; to law enforcement
 11 12 agencies and peace officers for certain official purposes;
 11 13 to the state auditor; and to financial institutions with a
 11 14 security interest in a motor vehicle.  The designated agent
 11 15 may be authorized to provide certified copies or electronic
 11 16 records, as appropriate, and to charge a fee for the provision
 11 17 of records and authentication of documents.
 11 18    A person who knowingly releases or discloses information
 11 19 from the database for a purpose other than those authorized in
 11 20 the bill or to a person who is not entitled to such information
 11 21 is guilty of a class "D" felony.
 11 22    The bill provides that the state and the department's
 11 23 designated agent are not liable to any person for gathering,
 11 24 managing, or using the information in the database in
 11 25 compliance with the bill.
 11 26    The bill provides for an effective date of July 1, 2016.

  9 14                           EXPLANATION
  9 15 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  9 16 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  9 17    This bill establishes a motor vehicle insurance verification
  9 18 program within the department of transportation.  The
  9 19 department is required to contract with a third party to act
  9 20 as the department's designated agent for administration of the
  9 21 program.
  9 22    The designated agent is required to establish and maintain a
  9 23 database containing information from insurers relating to motor
  9 24 vehicle insurance coverage for registered motor vehicles, motor
  9 25 vehicle identification information, personal identification
  9 26 information for registered owners of motor vehicles, and any
  9 27 other information provided to the designated agent by the
  9 28 department.
  9 29    At least twice a month, the designated agent shall update the
  9 30 database and compare current motor vehicle registrations with
  9 31 updated insurance information.  The files in the database shall
  9 32 be archived semiannually and audited by the department at least
  9 33 annually.  The bill requires the department to adopt rules for
  9 34 administration of the database.
  9 35    If database records show that a registered motor vehicle
 10  1 is not covered under an owner's policy of liability insurance
 10  2 for three months, the designated agent shall send a notice to
 10  3 the owner requiring the owner to respond within 15 days by
 10  4 providing proof of financial liability coverage or proof that
 10  5 the owner is exempt from the requirement to maintain financial
 10  6 liability coverage.  If the owner fails to respond, a second
 10  7 notice will be sent.  If the owner does not respond to the
 10  8 second notice, the owner's motor vehicle registration will be
 10  9 revoked by the department and the owner will be required to
 10 10 surrender the registration plates and registration receipt for
 10 11 the vehicle to the county treasurer.  In order to obtain a
 10 12 new registration for the vehicle, the owner must comply with
 10 13 financial responsibility requirements and pay an administrative
 10 14 fee of $100. The fees are to be used by the department
 10 15 exclusively to offset the costs of administering the program.
 10 16 Any fees in excess of the amount needed for administration of
 10 17 the program are to be transferred to the road use tax fund
 10 18 annually on June 30.
 10 19    The bill provides that if a motor vehicle is covered by a
 10 20 form of financial liability coverage other than an insurance
 10 21 policy, that fact shall be noted in the database.
 10 22    The bill prohibits a person from providing false or
 10 23 fraudulent information to the department or the department's
 10 24 designated agent in relation to the motor vehicle insurance
 10 25 verification program.  A violation is a simple misdemeanor.
 10 26    The bill requires each insurer that issues a policy that
 10 27 includes motor vehicle liability coverage, uninsured motorist
 10 28 coverage, underinsured motorist coverage, or personal injury
 10 29 coverage to the owner of a motor vehicle to provide, before the
 10 30 7th and the 21st of each month, to the department's designated
 10 31 agent a record of each motor vehicle insurance policy issued by
 10 32 the insurer and in effect for vehicles registered or garaged in
 10 33 this state as of the date of the previous submission. Vehicles
 10 34 subject to apportioned registration are not included in this
 10 35 requirement.  Insurers that fail to comply with the reporting
 11  1 requirement may be assessed a civil penalty of $250 per day.
 11  2 However, the department may waive the penalty upon a showing
 11  3 that the failure was inadvertent, accidental, or the result
 11  4 of excusable neglect. An insurer that discloses records to
 11  5 the department's designated agent in a reasonable, good=faith
 11  6 effort to comply with the bill is not subject to the penalty.
 11  7    Information contained in the database is confidential,
 11  8 but the bill provides exceptions for disclosures to state or
 11  9 local government agencies and courts for specified purposes;
 11 10 to individuals and certain other authorized persons; for
 11 11 purposes of an accident investigation; to law enforcement
 11 12 agencies and peace officers for certain official purposes;
 11 13 to the state auditor; and to financial institutions with a
 11 14 security interest in a motor vehicle.  The designated agent
 11 15 may be authorized to provide certified copies or electronic
 11 16 records, as appropriate, and to charge a fee for the provision
 11 17 of records and authentication of documents.
 11 18    A person who knowingly releases or discloses information
 11 19 from the database for a purpose other than those authorized in
 11 20 the bill or to a person who is not entitled to such information
 11 21 is guilty of a class "D" felony.
 11 22    The bill provides that the state and the department's
 11 23 designated agent are not liable to any person for gathering,
 11 24 managing, or using the information in the database in
 11 25 compliance with the bill.

  9 15 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  9 16 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  9 17    This bill establishes a motor vehicle insurance verification
  9 18 program within the department of transportation.  The
  9 19 department is required to contract with a third party to act
  9 20 as the department's designated agent for administration of the
  9 21 program.
  9 22    The designated agent is required to establish and maintain a
  9 23 database containing information from insurers relating to motor
  9 24 vehicle insurance coverage for registered motor vehicles, motor
  9 25 vehicle identification information, personal identification
  9 26 information for registered owners of motor vehicles, and any
  9 27 other information provided to the designated agent by the
  9 28 department.
  9 29    At least twice a month, the designated agent shall update the
  9 30 database and compare current motor vehicle registrations with
  9 31 updated insurance information.  The files in the database shall
  9 32 be archived semiannually and audited by the department at least
  9 33 annually.  The bill requires the department to adopt rules for
  9 34 administration of the database.
  9 35    If database records show that a registered motor vehicle
 10  1 is not covered under an owner's policy of liability insurance
 10  2 for three months, the designated agent shall send a notice to
 10  3 the owner requiring the owner to respond within 15 days by
 10  4 providing proof of financial liability coverage or proof that
 10  5 the owner is exempt from the requirement to maintain financial
 10  6 liability coverage.  If the owner fails to respond, a second
 10  7 notice will be sent.  If the owner does not respond to the
 10  8 second notice, the owner's motor vehicle registration will be
 10  9 revoked by the department and the owner will be required to
 10 10 surrender the registration plates and registration receipt for
 10 11 the vehicle to the county treasurer.  In order to obtain a
 10 12 new registration for the vehicle, the owner must comply with
 10 13 financial responsibility requirements and pay an administrative
 10 14 fee of $100. The fees are to be used by the department
 10 15 exclusively to offset the costs of administering the program.
 10 16 Any fees in excess of the amount needed for administration of
 10 17 the program are to be transferred to the road use tax fund
 10 18 annually on June 30.
 10 19    The bill provides that if a motor vehicle is covered by a
 10 20 form of financial liability coverage other than an insurance
 10 21 policy, that fact shall be noted in the database.
 10 22    The bill prohibits a person from providing false or
 10 23 fraudulent information to the department or the department's
 10 24 designated agent in relation to the motor vehicle insurance
 10 25 verification program.  A violation is a simple misdemeanor.
 10 26    The bill requires each insurer that issues a policy that
 10 27 includes motor vehicle liability coverage, uninsured motorist
 10 28 coverage, underinsured motorist coverage, or personal injury
 10 29 coverage to the owner of a motor vehicle to provide, before the
 10 30 7th and the 21st of each month, to the department's designated
 10 31 agent a record of each motor vehicle insurance policy issued by
 10 32 the insurer and in effect for vehicles registered or garaged in
 10 33 this state as of the date of the previous submission. Vehicles

  9 14                           EXPLANATION
  9 15 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  9 16 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  9 17    This bill establishes a motor vehicle insurance verification
  9 18 program within the department of transportation.  The
  9 19 department is required to contract with a third party to act
  9 20 as the department's designated agent for administration of the
  9 21 program.
  9 22    The designated agent is required to establish and maintain a
  9 23 database containing information from insurers relating to motor
  9 24 vehicle insurance coverage for registered motor vehicles, motor
  9 25 vehicle identification information, personal identification
  9 26 information for registered owners of motor vehicles, and any
  9 27 other information provided to the designated agent by the
  9 28 department.
  9 29    At least twice a month, the designated agent shall update the
  9 30 database and compare current motor vehicle registrations with
  9 31 updated insurance information.  The files in the database shall
  9 32 be archived semiannually and audited by the department at least
  9 33 annually.  The bill requires the department to adopt rules for
  9 34 administration of the database.
  9 35    If database records show that a registered motor vehicle
 10  1 is not covered under an owner's policy of liability insurance
 10  2 for three months, the designated agent shall send a notice to
 10  3 the owner requiring the owner to respond within 15 days by
 10  4 providing proof of financial liability coverage or proof that
 10  5 the owner is exempt from the requirement to maintain financial
 10  6 liability coverage.  If the owner fails to respond, a second
 10  7 notice will be sent.  If the owner does not respond to the
 10  8 second notice, the owner's motor vehicle registration will be
 10  9 revoked by the department and the owner will be required to
 10 10 surrender the registration plates and registration receipt for
 10 11 the vehicle to the county treasurer.  In order to obtain a
 10 12 new registration for the vehicle, the owner must comply with
 10 13 financial responsibility requirements and pay an administrative
 10 14 fee of $100. The fees are to be used by the department
 10 15 exclusively to offset the costs of administering the program.
 10 16 Any fees in excess of the amount needed for administration of
 10 17 the program are to be transferred to the road use tax fund
 10 18 annually on June 30.
 10 19    The bill provides that if a motor vehicle is covered by a
 10 20 form of financial liability coverage other than an insurance
 10 21 policy, that fact shall be noted in the database.
 10 22    The bill prohibits a person from providing false or
 10 23 fraudulent information to the department or the department's
 10 24 designated agent in relation to the motor vehicle insurance
 10 25 verification program.  A violation is a simple misdemeanor.
 10 26    The bill requires each insurer that issues a policy that
 10 27 includes motor vehicle liability coverage, uninsured motorist
 10 28 coverage, underinsured motorist coverage, or personal injury
 10 29 coverage to the owner of a motor vehicle to provide, before the
 10 30 7th and the 21st of each month, to the department's designated
 10 31 agent a record of each motor vehicle insurance policy issued by
 10 32 the insurer and in effect for vehicles registered or garaged in
 10 33 this state as of the date of the previous submission. Vehicles
 10 34 subject to apportioned registration are not included in this
 10 35 requirement.  Insurers that fail to comply with the reporting
 11  1 requirement may be assessed a civil penalty of $250 per day.
 11  2 However, the department may waive the penalty upon a showing
 11  3 that the failure was inadvertent, accidental, or the result
 11  4 of excusable neglect. An insurer that discloses records to
 11  5 the department's designated agent in a reasonable, good=faith
 11  6 effort to comply with the bill is not subject to the penalty.
 11  7    Information contained in the database is confidential,
 11  8 but the bill provides exceptions for disclosures to state or
 11  9 local government agencies and courts for specified purposes;
 11 10 to individuals and certain other authorized persons; for
 11 11 purposes of an accident investigation; to law enforcement
 11 12 agencies and peace officers for certain official purposes;
 11 13 to the state auditor; and to financial institutions with a
 11 14 security interest in a motor vehicle.  The designated agent
 11 15 may be authorized to provide certified copies or electronic
 11 16 records, as appropriate, and to charge a fee for the provision
 11 17 of records and authentication of documents.
 11 18    A person who knowingly releases or discloses information
 11 19 from the database for a purpose other than those authorized in
 11 20 the bill or to a person who is not entitled to such information
 11 21 is guilty of a class "D" felony.
 11 22    The bill provides that the state and the department's
 11 23 designated agent are not liable to any person for gathering,
 11 24 managing, or using the information in the database in
 11 25 compliance with the bill.

  9 17    This bill establishes a motor vehicle insurance verification
  9 18 program within the department of transportation.  The
  9 19 department is required to contract with a third party to act
  9 20 as the department's designated agent for administration of the
  9 21 program.
  9 22    The designated agent is required to establish and maintain a
  9 23 database containing information from insurers relating to motor
  9 24 vehicle insurance coverage for registered motor vehicles, motor
  9 25 vehicle identification information, personal identification
  9 26 information for registered owners of motor vehicles, and any
  9 27 other information provided to the designated agent by the

  9 29    At least twice a month, the designated agent shall update the
  9 30 database and compare current motor vehicle registrations with

  9 35    If database records show that a registered motor vehicle
 10  1 is not covered under an owner's policy of liability insurance
 10  2 for three months, the designated agent shall send a notice to
 10  3 the owner requiring the owner to respond within 15 days by
 10  4 providing proof of financial liability coverage or proof that
 10  5 the owner is exempt from the requirement to maintain financial
 10  6 liability coverage.  If the owner fails to respond, a second
 10  7 notice will be sent.  If the owner does not respond to the
 10  8 second notice, the owner's motor vehicle registration will be
 10  9 revoked by the department and the owner will be required to
 10 10 surrender the registration plates and registration receipt for
 10 11 the vehicle to the county treasurer.  In order to obtain a
 10 12 new registration for the vehicle, the owner must comply with
 10 13 financial responsibility requirements and pay an administrative

 10 19    The bill provides that if a motor vehicle is covered by a

  9 28 department.
  9 29    At least twice a month, the designated agent shall update the
  9 30 database and compare current motor vehicle registrations with
  9 31 updated insurance information.  The files in the database shall
  9 32 be archived semiannually and audited by the department at least

  9 34 administration of the database.
  9 35    If database records show that a registered motor vehicle
 10  1 is not covered under an owner's policy of liability insurance
 10  2 for three months, the designated agent shall send a notice to
 10  3 the owner requiring the owner to respond within 15 days by
 10  4 providing proof of financial liability coverage or proof that
 10  5 the owner is exempt from the requirement to maintain financial

 10  8 second notice, the owner's motor vehicle registration will be
 10  9 revoked by the department and the owner will be required to
 10 10 surrender the registration plates and registration receipt for
 10 11 the vehicle to the county treasurer.  In order to obtain a
 10 12 new registration for the vehicle, the owner must comply with
 10 13 financial responsibility requirements and pay an administrative
 10 14 fee of $100. The fees are to be used by the department
 10 15 exclusively to offset the costs of administering the program.
 10 16 Any fees in excess of the amount needed for administration of
 10 17 the program are to be transferred to the road use tax fund
 10 18 annually on June 30.
 10 19    The bill provides that if a motor vehicle is covered by a
 10 20 form of financial liability coverage other than an insurance
 10 21 policy, that fact shall be noted in the database.
 10 22    The bill prohibits a person from providing false or
 10 23 fraudulent information to the department or the department's
 10 24 designated agent in relation to the motor vehicle insurance
 10 25 verification program.  A violation is a simple misdemeanor.
 10 26    The bill requires each insurer that issues a policy that
 10 27 includes motor vehicle liability coverage, uninsured motorist
 10 28 coverage, underinsured motorist coverage, or personal injury
 10 29 coverage to the owner of a motor vehicle to provide, before the
 10 30 7th and the 21st of each month, to the department's designated
 10 31 agent a record of each motor vehicle insurance policy issued by
 10 32 the insurer and in effect for vehicles registered or garaged in
 10 33 this state as of the date of the previous submission. Vehicles
 10 34 subject to apportioned registration are not included in this
 10 35 requirement.  Insurers that fail to comply with the reporting
 11  1 requirement may be assessed a civil penalty of $250 per day.
 11  2 However, the department may waive the penalty upon a showing
 11  3 that the failure was inadvertent, accidental, or the result
 11  4 of excusable neglect. An insurer that discloses records to
 11  5 the department's designated agent in a reasonable, good=faith
 11  6 effort to comply with the bill is not subject to the penalty.
 11  7    Information contained in the database is confidential,
 11  8 but the bill provides exceptions for disclosures to state or
 11  9 local government agencies and courts for specified purposes;
 11 10 to individuals and certain other authorized persons; for
 11 11 purposes of an accident investigation; to law enforcement
 11 12 agencies and peace officers for certain official purposes;
 11 13 to the state auditor; and to financial institutions with a

 11 15 may be authorized to provide certified copies or electronic

  9 14                           EXPLANATION
  9 15 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  9 16 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  9 17    This bill establishes a motor vehicle insurance verification
  9 18 program within the department of transportation.  The
  9 19 department is required to contract with a third party to act
  9 20 as the department's designated agent for administration of the
  9 21 program.
  9 22    The designated agent is required to establish and maintain a
  9 23 database containing information from insurers relating to motor
  9 24 vehicle insurance coverage for registered motor vehicles, motor
  9 25 vehicle identification information, personal identification
  9 26 information for registered owners of motor vehicles, and any
  9 27 other information provided to the designated agent by the
  9 28 department.
  9 29    At least twice a month, the designated agent shall update the
  9 30 database and compare current motor vehicle registrations with
  9 31 updated insurance information.  The files in the database shall
  9 32 be archived semiannually and audited by the department at least
  9 33 annually.  The bill requires the department to adopt rules for
  9 34 administration of the database.
  9 35    If database records show that a registered motor vehicle
 10  1 is not covered under an owner's policy of liability insurance
 10  2 for three months, the designated agent shall send a notice to
 10  3 the owner requiring the owner to respond within 15 days by
 10  4 providing proof of financial liability coverage or proof that
 10  5 the owner is exempt from the requirement to maintain financial
 10  6 liability coverage.  If the owner fails to respond, a second
 10  7 notice will be sent.  If the owner does not respond to the
 10  8 second notice, the owner's motor vehicle registration will be
 10  9 revoked by the department and the owner will be required to
 10 10 surrender the registration plates and registration receipt for
 10 11 the vehicle to the county treasurer.  In order to obtain a
 10 12 new registration for the vehicle, the owner must comply with
 10 13 financial responsibility requirements and pay an administrative
 10 14 fee of $100. The fees are to be used by the department
 10 15 exclusively to offset the costs of administering the program.
 10 16 Any fees in excess of the amount needed for administration of
 10 17 the program are to be transferred to the road use tax fund
 10 18 annually on June 30.
 10 19    The bill provides that if a motor vehicle is covered by a
 10 20 form of financial liability coverage other than an insurance
 10 21 policy, that fact shall be noted in the database.
 10 22    The bill prohibits a person from providing false or
 10 23 fraudulent information to the department or the department's
 10 24 designated agent in relation to the motor vehicle insurance
 10 25 verification program.  A violation is a simple misdemeanor.
 10 26    The bill requires each insurer that issues a policy that
 10 27 includes motor vehicle liability coverage, uninsured motorist
 10 28 coverage, underinsured motorist coverage, or personal injury
 10 29 coverage to the owner of a motor vehicle to provide, before the
 10 30 7th and the 21st of each month, to the department's designated
 10 31 agent a record of each motor vehicle insurance policy issued by
 10 32 the insurer and in effect for vehicles registered or garaged in
 10 33 this state as of the date of the previous submission. Vehicles
 10 34 subject to apportioned registration are not included in this
 10 35 requirement.  Insurers that fail to comply with the reporting
 11  1 requirement may be assessed a civil penalty of $250 per day.
 11  2 However, the department may waive the penalty upon a showing
 11  3 that the failure was inadvertent, accidental, or the result
 11  4 of excusable neglect. An insurer that discloses records to
 11  5 the department's designated agent in a reasonable, good=faith
 11  6 effort to comply with the bill is not subject to the penalty.
 11  7    Information contained in the database is confidential,
 11  8 but the bill provides exceptions for disclosures to state or
 11  9 local government agencies and courts for specified purposes;
 11 10 to individuals and certain other authorized persons; for
 11 11 purposes of an accident investigation; to law enforcement
 11 12 agencies and peace officers for certain official purposes;
 11 13 to the state auditor; and to financial institutions with a
 11 14 security interest in a motor vehicle.  The designated agent
 11 15 may be authorized to provide certified copies or electronic
 11 16 records, as appropriate, and to charge a fee for the provision
 11 17 of records and authentication of documents.
 11 18    A person who knowingly releases or discloses information
 11 19 from the database for a purpose other than those authorized in
 11 20 the bill or to a person who is not entitled to such information
 11 21 is guilty of a class "D" felony.
 11 22    The bill provides that the state and the department's
 11 23 designated agent are not liable to any person for gathering,
 11 24 managing, or using the information in the database in
 11 25 compliance with the bill.
 11 26    The bill provides for an effective date of July 1, 2016.

  9 15 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  9 16 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  9 17    This bill establishes a motor vehicle insurance verification
  9 18 program within the department of transportation.  The
  9 19 department is required to contract with a third party to act
  9 20 as the department's designated agent for administration of the
  9 21 program.
  9 22    The designated agent is required to establish and maintain a
  9 23 database containing information from insurers relating to motor
  9 24 vehicle insurance coverage for registered motor vehicles, motor
  9 25 vehicle identification information, personal identification
  9 26 information for registered owners of motor vehicles, and any
  9 27 other information provided to the designated agent by the
  9 28 department.
  9 29    At least twice a month, the designated agent shall update the
  9 30 database and compare current motor vehicle registrations with
  9 31 updated insurance information.  The files in the database shall
  9 32 be archived semiannually and audited by the department at least
  9 33 annually.  The bill requires the department to adopt rules for
  9 34 administration of the database.
  9 35    If database records show that a registered motor vehicle
 10  1 is not covered under an owner's policy of liability insurance
 10  2 for three months, the designated agent shall send a notice to
 10  3 the owner requiring the owner to respond within 15 days by
 10  4 providing proof of financial liability coverage or proof that
 10  5 the owner is exempt from the requirement to maintain financial
 10  6 liability coverage.  If the owner fails to respond, a second
 10  7 notice will be sent.  If the owner does not respond to the
 10  8 second notice, the owner's motor vehicle registration will be
 10  9 revoked by the department and the owner will be required to
 10 10 surrender the registration plates and registration receipt for
 10 11 the vehicle to the county treasurer.  In order to obtain a
 10 12 new registration for the vehicle, the owner must comply with
 10 13 financial responsibility requirements and pay an administrative
 10 14 fee of $100. The fees are to be used by the department
 10 15 exclusively to offset the costs of administering the program.
 10 16 Any fees in excess of the amount needed for administration of
 10 17 the program are to be transferred to the road use tax fund
 10 18 annually on June 30.
 10 19    The bill provides that if a motor vehicle is covered by a
 10 20 form of financial liability coverage other than an insurance
 10 21 policy, that fact shall be noted in the database.
 10 22    The bill prohibits a person from providing false or
 10 23 fraudulent information to the department or the department's
 10 24 designated agent in relation to the motor vehicle insurance
 10 25 verification program.  A violation is a simple misdemeanor.
 10 26    The bill requires each insurer that issues a policy that
 10 27 includes motor vehicle liability coverage, uninsured motorist
 10 28 coverage, underinsured motorist coverage, or personal injury
 10 29 coverage to the owner of a motor vehicle to provide, before the
 10 30 7th and the 21st of each month, to the department's designated
 10 31 agent a record of each motor vehicle insurance policy issued by
 10 32 the insurer and in effect for vehicles registered or garaged in
 10 33 this state as of the date of the previous submission. Vehicles
 10 34 subject to apportioned registration are not included in this
 10 35 requirement.  Insurers that fail to comply with the reporting
 11  1 requirement may be assessed a civil penalty of $250 per day.
 11  2 However, the department may waive the penalty upon a showing
 11  3 that the failure was inadvertent, accidental, or the result
 11  4 of excusable neglect. An insurer that discloses records to
 11  5 the department's designated agent in a reasonable, good=faith
 11  6 effort to comply with the bill is not subject to the penalty.
 11  7    Information contained in the database is confidential,
 11  8 but the bill provides exceptions for disclosures to state or
 11  9 local government agencies and courts for specified purposes;
 11 10 to individuals and certain other authorized persons; for
 11 11 purposes of an accident investigation; to law enforcement
 11 12 agencies and peace officers for certain official purposes;

 11 15 may be authorized to provide certified copies or electronic
 11 16 records, as appropriate, and to charge a fee for the provision
 11 17 of records and authentication of documents.
 11 18    A person who knowingly releases or discloses information
 11 19 from the database for a purpose other than those authorized in
 11 20 the bill or to a person who is not entitled to such information
 11 21 is guilty of a class "D" felony.

  9 15 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  9 16 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  9 17    This bill establishes a motor vehicle insurance verification
  9 18 program within the department of transportation.  The
  9 19 department is required to contract with a third party to act
  9 20 as the department's designated agent for administration of the
  9 21 program.
  9 22    The designated agent is required to establish and maintain a
  9 23 database containing information from insurers relating to motor
  9 24 vehicle insurance coverage for registered motor vehicles, motor
  9 25 vehicle identification information, personal identification
  9 26 information for registered owners of motor vehicles, and any
  9 27 other information provided to the designated agent by the
  9 28 department.
  9 29    At least twice a month, the designated agent shall update the
  9 30 database and compare current motor vehicle registrations with
  9 31 updated insurance information.  The files in the database shall
  9 32 be archived semiannually and audited by the department at least
  9 33 annually.  The bill requires the department to adopt rules for
  9 34 administration of the database.
  9 35    If database records show that a registered motor vehicle
 10  1 is not covered under an owner's policy of liability insurance
 10  2 for three months, the designated agent shall send a notice to
 10  3 the owner requiring the owner to respond within 15 days by
 10  4 providing proof of financial liability coverage or proof that
 10  5 the owner is exempt from the requirement to maintain financial
 10  6 liability coverage.  If the owner fails to respond, a second
 10  7 notice will be sent.  If the owner does not respond to the
 10  8 second notice, the owner's motor vehicle registration will be
 10  9 revoked by the department and the owner will be required to
 10 10 surrender the registration plates and registration receipt for
 10 11 the vehicle to the county treasurer.  In order to obtain a
 10 12 new registration for the vehicle, the owner must comply with
 10 13 financial responsibility requirements and pay an administrative
 10 14 fee of $100. The fees are to be used by the department
 10 15 exclusively to offset the costs of administering the program.
 10 16 Any fees in excess of the amount needed for administration of
 10 17 the program are to be transferred to the road use tax fund
 10 18 annually on June 30.
 10 19    The bill provides that if a motor vehicle is covered by a
 10 20 form of financial liability coverage other than an insurance
 10 21 policy, that fact shall be noted in the database.
 10 22    The bill prohibits a person from providing false or
 10 23 fraudulent information to the department or the department's
 10 24 designated agent in relation to the motor vehicle insurance
 10 25 verification program.  A violation is a simple misdemeanor.
 10 26    The bill requires each insurer that issues a policy that
 10 27 includes motor vehicle liability coverage, uninsured motorist
 10 28 coverage, underinsured motorist coverage, or personal injury
 10 29 coverage to the owner of a motor vehicle to provide, before the
 10 30 7th and the 21st of each month, to the department's designated
 10 31 agent a record of each motor vehicle insurance policy issued by
 10 32 the insurer and in effect for vehicles registered or garaged in
 10 33 this state as of the date of the previous submission. Vehicles
 10 34 subject to apportioned registration are not included in this
 10 35 requirement.  Insurers that fail to comply with the reporting
 11  1 requirement may be assessed a civil penalty of $250 per day.
 11  2 However, the department may waive the penalty upon a showing
 11  3 that the failure was inadvertent, accidental, or the result
 11  4 of excusable neglect. An insurer that discloses records to
 11  5 the department's designated agent in a reasonable, good=faith
 11  6 effort to comply with the bill is not subject to the penalty.
 11  7    Information contained in the database is confidential,
 11  8 but the bill provides exceptions for disclosures to state or
 11  9 local government agencies and courts for specified purposes;
 11 10 to individuals and certain other authorized persons; for
 11 11 purposes of an accident investigation; to law enforcement
 11 12 agencies and peace officers for certain official purposes;
 11 13 to the state auditor; and to financial institutions with a
 11 14 security interest in a motor vehicle.  The designated agent
 11 15 may be authorized to provide certified copies or electronic
 11 16 records, as appropriate, and to charge a fee for the provision
 11 17 of records and authentication of documents.
 11 18    A person who knowingly releases or discloses information

  9 14                           EXPLANATION
  9 15 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  9 16 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  9 17    This bill establishes a motor vehicle insurance verification
  9 18 program within the department of transportation.  The
  9 19 department is required to contract with a third party to act
  9 20 as the department's designated agent for administration of the
  9 21 program.
  9 22    The designated agent is required to establish and maintain a
  9 23 database containing information from insurers relating to motor
  9 24 vehicle insurance coverage for registered motor vehicles, motor
  9 25 vehicle identification information, personal identification
  9 26 information for registered owners of motor vehicles, and any
  9 27 other information provided to the designated agent by the
  9 28 department.
  9 29    At least twice a month, the designated agent shall update the
  9 30 database and compare current motor vehicle registrations with
  9 31 updated insurance information.  The files in the database shall
  9 32 be archived semiannually and audited by the department at least
  9 33 annually.  The bill requires the department to adopt rules for
  9 34 administration of the database.
  9 35    If database records show that a registered motor vehicle
 10  1 is not covered under an owner's policy of liability insurance
 10  2 for three months, the designated agent shall send a notice to
 10  3 the owner requiring the owner to respond within 15 days by
 10  4 providing proof of financial liability coverage or proof that
 10  5 the owner is exempt from the requirement to maintain financial
 10  6 liability coverage.  If the owner fails to respond, a second
 10  7 notice will be sent.  If the owner does not respond to the
 10  8 second notice, the owner's motor vehicle registration will be
 10  9 revoked by the department and the owner will be required to
 10 10 surrender the registration plates and registration receipt for
 10 11 the vehicle to the county treasurer.  In order to obtain a
 10 12 new registration for the vehicle, the owner must comply with
 10 13 financial responsibility requirements and pay an administrative
 10 14 fee of $100. The fees are to be used by the department
 10 15 exclusively to offset the costs of administering the program.
 10 16 Any fees in excess of the amount needed for administration of
 10 17 the program are to be transferred to the road use tax fund
 10 18 annually on June 30.
 10 19    The bill provides that if a motor vehicle is covered by a
 10 20 form of financial liability coverage other than an insurance
 10 21 policy, that fact shall be noted in the database.
 10 22    The bill prohibits a person from providing false or
 10 23 fraudulent information to the department or the department's
 10 24 designated agent in relation to the motor vehicle insurance
 10 25 verification program.  A violation is a simple misdemeanor.
 10 26    The bill requires each insurer that issues a policy that
 10 27 includes motor vehicle liability coverage, uninsured motorist
 10 28 coverage, underinsured motorist coverage, or personal injury
 10 29 coverage to the owner of a motor vehicle to provide, before the
 10 30 7th and the 21st of each month, to the department's designated
 10 31 agent a record of each motor vehicle insurance policy issued by
 10 32 the insurer and in effect for vehicles registered or garaged in
 10 33 this state as of the date of the previous submission. Vehicles
 10 34 subject to apportioned registration are not included in this
 10 35 requirement.  Insurers that fail to comply with the reporting
 11  1 requirement may be assessed a civil penalty of $250 per day.
 11  2 However, the department may waive the penalty upon a showing
 11  3 that the failure was inadvertent, accidental, or the result
 11  4 of excusable neglect. An insurer that discloses records to
 11  5 the department's designated agent in a reasonable, good=faith
 11  6 effort to comply with the bill is not subject to the penalty.
 11  7    Information contained in the database is confidential,
 11  8 but the bill provides exceptions for disclosures to state or
 11  9 local government agencies and courts for specified purposes;
 11 10 to individuals and certain other authorized persons; for
 11 11 purposes of an accident investigation; to law enforcement
 11 12 agencies and peace officers for certain official purposes;
 11 13 to the state auditor; and to financial institutions with a
 11 14 security interest in a motor vehicle.  The designated agent
 11 15 may be authorized to provide certified copies or electronic
 11 16 records, as appropriate, and to charge a fee for the provision
 11 17 of records and authentication of documents.
 11 18    A person who knowingly releases or discloses information
 11 19 from the database for a purpose other than those authorized in
 11 20 the bill or to a person who is not entitled to such information
 11 21 is guilty of a class "D" felony.
 11 22    The bill provides that the state and the department's
 11 23 designated agent are not liable to any person for gathering,
 11 24 managing, or using the information in the database in
 11 25 compliance with the bill.

 10 27 includes motor vehicle liability coverage, uninsured motorist
 10 28 coverage, underinsured motorist coverage, or personal injury
 10 29 coverage to the owner of a motor vehicle to provide, before the
 10 30 7th and the 21st of each month, to the department's designated
 10 31 agent a record of each motor vehicle insurance policy issued by
 10 32 the insurer and in effect for vehicles registered or garaged in
 10 33 this state as of the date of the previous submission. Vehicles
 10 34 subject to apportioned registration are not included in this
 10 35 requirement.  Insurers that fail to comply with the reporting
 11  1 requirement may be assessed a civil penalty of $250 per day.
 11  2 However, the department may waive the penalty upon a showing
 11  3 that the failure was inadvertent, accidental, or the result
 11  4 of excusable neglect. An insurer that discloses records to
 11  5 the department's designated agent in a reasonable, good=faith
 11  6 effort to comply with the bill is not subject to the penalty.
 11  7    Information contained in the database is confidential,
 11  8 but the bill provides exceptions for disclosures to state or
 11  9 local government agencies and courts for specified purposes;
 11 10 to individuals and certain other authorized persons; for

  9 14                           EXPLANATION
  9 15 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  9 16 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  9 17    This bill establishes a motor vehicle insurance verification
  9 18 program within the department of transportation.  The
  9 19 department is required to contract with a third party to act
  9 20 as the department's designated agent for administration of the
  9 21 program.
  9 22    The designated agent is required to establish and maintain a
  9 23 database containing information from insurers relating to motor
  9 24 vehicle insurance coverage for registered motor vehicles, motor
  9 25 vehicle identification information, personal identification
  9 26 information for registered owners of motor vehicles, and any
  9 27 other information provided to the designated agent by the
  9 28 department.
  9 29    At least twice a month, the designated agent shall update the
  9 30 database and compare current motor vehicle registrations with
  9 31 updated insurance information.  The files in the database shall
  9 32 be archived semiannually and audited by the department at least
  9 33 annually.  The bill requires the department to adopt rules for
  9 34 administration of the database.
  9 35    If database records show that a registered motor vehicle
 10  1 is not covered under an owner's policy of liability insurance
 10  2 for three months, the designated agent shall send a notice to
 10  3 the owner requiring the owner to respond within 15 days by
 10  4 providing proof of financial liability coverage or proof that
 10  5 the owner is exempt from the requirement to maintain financial
 10  6 liability coverage.  If the owner fails to respond, a second
 10  7 notice will be sent.  If the owner does not respond to the
 10  8 second notice, the owner's motor vehicle registration will be
 10  9 revoked by the department and the owner will be required to
 10 10 surrender the registration plates and registration receipt for
 10 11 the vehicle to the county treasurer.  In order to obtain a
 10 12 new registration for the vehicle, the owner must comply with
 10 13 financial responsibility requirements and pay an administrative
 10 14 fee of $100. The fees are to be used by the department
 10 15 exclusively to offset the costs of administering the program.
 10 16 Any fees in excess of the amount needed for administration of
 10 17 the program are to be transferred to the road use tax fund
 10 18 annually on June 30.
 10 19    The bill provides that if a motor vehicle is covered by a
 10 20 form of financial liability coverage other than an insurance
 10 21 policy, that fact shall be noted in the database.
 10 22    The bill prohibits a person from providing false or
 10 23 fraudulent information to the department or the department's
 10 24 designated agent in relation to the motor vehicle insurance
 10 25 verification program.  A violation is a simple misdemeanor.
 10 26    The bill requires each insurer that issues a policy that
 10 27 includes motor vehicle liability coverage, uninsured motorist
 10 28 coverage, underinsured motorist coverage, or personal injury
 10 29 coverage to the owner of a motor vehicle to provide, before the
 10 30 7th and the 21st of each month, to the department's designated
 10 31 agent a record of each motor vehicle insurance policy issued by
 10 32 the insurer and in effect for vehicles registered or garaged in
 10 33 this state as of the date of the previous submission. Vehicles
 10 34 subject to apportioned registration are not included in this
 10 35 requirement.  Insurers that fail to comply with the reporting
 11  1 requirement may be assessed a civil penalty of $250 per day.
 11  2 However, the department may waive the penalty upon a showing
 11  3 that the failure was inadvertent, accidental, or the result
 11  4 of excusable neglect. An insurer that discloses records to
 11  5 the department's designated agent in a reasonable, good=faith
 11  6 effort to comply with the bill is not subject to the penalty.
 11  7    Information contained in the database is confidential,
 11  8 but the bill provides exceptions for disclosures to state or
 11  9 local government agencies and courts for specified purposes;
 11 10 to individuals and certain other authorized persons; for
 11 11 purposes of an accident investigation; to law enforcement
 11 12 agencies and peace officers for certain official purposes;
 11 13 to the state auditor; and to financial institutions with a
 11 14 security interest in a motor vehicle.  The designated agent
 11 15 may be authorized to provide certified copies or electronic
 11 16 records, as appropriate, and to charge a fee for the provision
 11 17 of records and authentication of documents.
 11 18    A person who knowingly releases or discloses information
 11 19 from the database for a purpose other than those authorized in
 11 20 the bill or to a person who is not entitled to such information
 11 21 is guilty of a class "D" felony.
 11 22    The bill provides that the state and the department's
 11 23 designated agent are not liable to any person for gathering,
 11 24 managing, or using the information in the database in
 11 25 compliance with the bill.

  9 14                           EXPLANATION
  9 15 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  9 16 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  9 17    This bill establishes a motor vehicle insurance verification
  9 18 program within the department of transportation.  The
  9 19 department is required to contract with a third party to act
  9 20 as the department's designated agent for administration of the
  9 21 program.
  9 22    The designated agent is required to establish and maintain a
  9 23 database containing information from insurers relating to motor
  9 24 vehicle insurance coverage for registered motor vehicles, motor
  9 25 vehicle identification information, personal identification
  9 26 information for registered owners of motor vehicles, and any
  9 27 other information provided to the designated agent by the
  9 28 department.
  9 29    At least twice a month, the designated agent shall update the
  9 30 database and compare current motor vehicle registrations with
  9 31 updated insurance information.  The files in the database shall
  9 32 be archived semiannually and audited by the department at least
  9 33 annually.  The bill requires the department to adopt rules for
  9 34 administration of the database.
  9 35    If database records show that a registered motor vehicle
 10  1 is not covered under an owner's policy of liability insurance
 10  2 for three months, the designated agent shall send a notice to
 10  3 the owner requiring the owner to respond within 15 days by
 10  4 providing proof of financial liability coverage or proof that
 10  5 the owner is exempt from the requirement to maintain financial
 10  6 liability coverage.  If the owner fails to respond, a second
 10  7 notice will be sent.  If the owner does not respond to the
 10  8 second notice, the owner's motor vehicle registration will be
 10  9 revoked by the department and the owner will be required to
 10 10 surrender the registration plates and registration receipt for
 10 11 the vehicle to the county treasurer.  In order to obtain a
 10 12 new registration for the vehicle, the owner must comply with
 10 13 financial responsibility requirements and pay an administrative
 10 14 fee of $100. The fees are to be used by the department
 10 15 exclusively to offset the costs of administering the program.
 10 16 Any fees in excess of the amount needed for administration of
 10 17 the program are to be transferred to the road use tax fund
 10 18 annually on June 30.
 10 19    The bill provides that if a motor vehicle is covered by a
 10 20 form of financial liability coverage other than an insurance
 10 21 policy, that fact shall be noted in the database.
 10 22    The bill prohibits a person from providing false or
 10 23 fraudulent information to the department or the department's
 10 24 designated agent in relation to the motor vehicle insurance
 10 25 verification program.  A violation is a simple misdemeanor.
 10 26    The bill requires each insurer that issues a policy that
 10 27 includes motor vehicle liability coverage, uninsured motorist
 10 28 coverage, underinsured motorist coverage, or personal injury
 10 29 coverage to the owner of a motor vehicle to provide, before the
 10 30 7th and the 21st of each month, to the department's designated
 10 31 agent a record of each motor vehicle insurance policy issued by
 10 32 the insurer and in effect for vehicles registered or garaged in
 10 33 this state as of the date of the previous submission. Vehicles
 10 34 subject to apportioned registration are not included in this
 10 35 requirement.  Insurers that fail to comply with the reporting
 11  1 requirement may be assessed a civil penalty of $250 per day.
 11  2 However, the department may waive the penalty upon a showing
 11  3 that the failure was inadvertent, accidental, or the result
 11  4 of excusable neglect. An insurer that discloses records to
 11  5 the department's designated agent in a reasonable, good=faith
 11  6 effort to comply with the bill is not subject to the penalty.
 11  7    Information contained in the database is confidential,
 11  8 but the bill provides exceptions for disclosures to state or
 11  9 local government agencies and courts for specified purposes;
 11 10 to individuals and certain other authorized persons; for
 11 11 purposes of an accident investigation; to law enforcement
 11 12 agencies and peace officers for certain official purposes;
 11 13 to the state auditor; and to financial institutions with a
 11 14 security interest in a motor vehicle.  The designated agent
 11 15 may be authorized to provide certified copies or electronic
 11 16 records, as appropriate, and to charge a fee for the provision
 11 17 of records and authentication of documents.
 11 18    A person who knowingly releases or discloses information
 11 19 from the database for a purpose other than those authorized in
 11 20 the bill or to a person who is not entitled to such information
 11 21 is guilty of a class "D" felony.
 11 22    The bill provides that the state and the department's
 11 23 designated agent are not liable to any person for gathering,
 11 24 managing, or using the information in the database in
 11 25 compliance with the bill.
