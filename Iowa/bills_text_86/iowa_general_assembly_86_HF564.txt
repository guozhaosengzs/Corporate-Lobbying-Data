  2 34                           EXPLANATION
  2 35 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  3  1 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  3  2    This bill provides for the issuance of a bridge order to
  3  3 transfer jurisdiction related to a child in need of assistance
  3  4 (CINA) case from the juvenile court to the district court.
  3  5 Under the bill, the juvenile court may close a CINA case by
  3  6 transferring jurisdiction over the child's custody, physical
  3  7 care, and visitation to the district court through a bridge
  3  8 order, if:  the child has been adjudicated a CINA in an active
  3  9 juvenile court case, and a dispositional order in that case is
  3 10 in place;  paternity of the child has been legally established,
  3 11 including by operation of law, by order of a court of competent
  3 12 jurisdiction, or by administrative  order when authorized by
  3 13 state law; the child is safely placed by the juvenile court
  3 14 with a parent; there is not a current district court order for
  3 15 custody in place; the juvenile court has determined that the
  3 16 CINA case can safely close once orders for custody, physical
  3 17 care, and visitation are entered by the district court;  and a
  3 18 parent qualified for a court=appointed attorney in the juvenile
  3 19 court case.
  3 20    If all of the criteria specified  are met, any party to a
  3 21 CINA proceeding in juvenile court may file a motion with the
  3 22 juvenile court for a bridge order. Such motion is required to
  3 23 be set for hearing no less than 30 days and not more than 90
  3 24 days from the date of filing the motion. The juvenile court,
  3 25 on its own motion, may set a hearing on the bridge order if the
  3 26 hearing is set no less than 30 days from the date of notice to
  3 27 the parties.
  3 28    The bill directs the juvenile court to designate the
  3 29 petitioner and respondent for the bridge order, which is
  3 30 limited to addressing only matters of custody, physical care,
  3 31 and visitation.  All other matters, including child support,
  3 32 are to be filed by separate petition or by action of the child
  3 33 support recovery unit (CSRU) and are subject to existing
  3 34 applicable statutory provisions.
  3 35    Upon transferring jurisdiction, the clerk of court is
  4  1 directed to docket the case. Filing fees and other court
  4  2 costs are not to be assessed against the parties. The bill
  4  3 provides that the district court shall take judicial notice
  4  4 of the juvenile file in any hearing related to the case and
  4  5 provides for confidentiality of the records contained in the
  4  6 district court case file that were copied or transferred from
  4  7 the juvenile court file and for disclosure of the records to
  4  8 the CSRU, upon request, without a court order.
  4  9    The bill provides for modification of the bridge order for
  4 10 issues relating only to custody, physical care, or visitation.
  4 11 If the petition for modification is filed within one year of
  4 12 the filing date of the bridge order, the party requesting
  4 13 modification is not required to demonstrate a substantial
  4 14 change of circumstances,  but instead must demonstrate that
  4 15 such modification is in the best interest of the child.
  4 16 Additionally, if a petition for modification is filed within
  4 17 one year of the filing date of the bridge order, filing fees
  4 18 and other court costs are not to be assessed against the
  4 19 parties. Nothing in the bill is to be construed to require
  4 20 appointment of counsel for the parties in the district court
  4 21 action.

  3 10 in place;  paternity of the child has been legally established,
  3 11 including by operation of law, by order of a court of competent
  3 12 jurisdiction, or by administrative  order when authorized by

  4  1 directed to docket the case. Filing fees and other court
  4  2 costs are not to be assessed against the parties. The bill

  4  7 the juvenile court file and for disclosure of the records to
  4  8 the CSRU, upon request, without a court order.
  4  9    The bill provides for modification of the bridge order for
  4 10 issues relating only to custody, physical care, or visitation.
  4 11 If the petition for modification is filed within one year of
  4 12 the filing date of the bridge order, the party requesting
  4 13 modification is not required to demonstrate a substantial
  4 14 change of circumstances,  but instead must demonstrate that

  4 18 and other court costs are not to be assessed against the
  4 19 parties. Nothing in the bill is to be construed to require

  2 35 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  3  1 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  3  2    This bill provides for the issuance of a bridge order to
  3  3 transfer jurisdiction related to a child in need of assistance
  3  4 (CINA) case from the juvenile court to the district court.
  3  5 Under the bill, the juvenile court may close a CINA case by
  3  6 transferring jurisdiction over the child's custody, physical
  3  7 care, and visitation to the district court through a bridge
  3  8 order, if:  the child has been adjudicated a CINA in an active
  3  9 juvenile court case, and a dispositional order in that case is
  3 10 in place;  paternity of the child has been legally established,
  3 11 including by operation of law, by order of a court of competent
  3 12 jurisdiction, or by administrative  order when authorized by
  3 13 state law; the child is safely placed by the juvenile court
  3 14 with a parent; there is not a current district court order for
  3 15 custody in place; the juvenile court has determined that the
  3 16 CINA case can safely close once orders for custody, physical
  3 17 care, and visitation are entered by the district court;  and a
  3 18 parent qualified for a court=appointed attorney in the juvenile
  3 19 court case.
  3 20    If all of the criteria specified  are met, any party to a
  3 21 CINA proceeding in juvenile court may file a motion with the
  3 22 juvenile court for a bridge order. Such motion is required to
  3 23 be set for hearing no less than 30 days and not more than 90
  3 24 days from the date of filing the motion. The juvenile court,
  3 25 on its own motion, may set a hearing on the bridge order if the
  3 26 hearing is set no less than 30 days from the date of notice to
  3 27 the parties.
  3 28    The bill directs the juvenile court to designate the
  3 29 petitioner and respondent for the bridge order, which is
  3 30 limited to addressing only matters of custody, physical care,
  3 31 and visitation.  All other matters, including child support,
  3 32 are to be filed by separate petition or by action of the child
  3 33 support recovery unit (CSRU) and are subject to existing
  3 34 applicable statutory provisions.
  3 35    Upon transferring jurisdiction, the clerk of court is
  4  1 directed to docket the case. Filing fees and other court
  4  2 costs are not to be assessed against the parties. The bill
  4  3 provides that the district court shall take judicial notice
  4  4 of the juvenile file in any hearing related to the case and
  4  5 provides for confidentiality of the records contained in the
  4  6 district court case file that were copied or transferred from
  4  7 the juvenile court file and for disclosure of the records to
  4  8 the CSRU, upon request, without a court order.
  4  9    The bill provides for modification of the bridge order for
  4 10 issues relating only to custody, physical care, or visitation.
  4 11 If the petition for modification is filed within one year of
  4 12 the filing date of the bridge order, the party requesting
  4 13 modification is not required to demonstrate a substantial
  4 14 change of circumstances,  but instead must demonstrate that
  4 15 such modification is in the best interest of the child.
  4 16 Additionally, if a petition for modification is filed within
  4 17 one year of the filing date of the bridge order, filing fees
  4 18 and other court costs are not to be assessed against the
  4 19 parties. Nothing in the bill is to be construed to require
  4 20 appointment of counsel for the parties in the district court
  4 21 action.

  3  5 Under the bill, the juvenile court may close a CINA case by
  3  6 transferring jurisdiction over the child's custody, physical
  3  7 care, and visitation to the district court through a bridge
  3  8 order, if:  the child has been adjudicated a CINA in an active
  3  9 juvenile court case, and a dispositional order in that case is
  3 10 in place;  paternity of the child has been legally established,
  3 11 including by operation of law, by order of a court of competent
  3 12 jurisdiction, or by administrative  order when authorized by
  3 13 state law; the child is safely placed by the juvenile court
  3 14 with a parent; there is not a current district court order for

  4 13 modification is not required to demonstrate a substantial
  4 14 change of circumstances,  but instead must demonstrate that

  3  2    This bill provides for the issuance of a bridge order to
  3  3 transfer jurisdiction related to a child in need of assistance

  3  5 Under the bill, the juvenile court may close a CINA case by
  3  6 transferring jurisdiction over the child's custody, physical
  3  7 care, and visitation to the district court through a bridge
  3  8 order, if:  the child has been adjudicated a CINA in an active
  3  9 juvenile court case, and a dispositional order in that case is
  3 10 in place;  paternity of the child has been legally established,
  3 11 including by operation of law, by order of a court of competent
  3 12 jurisdiction, or by administrative  order when authorized by
  3 13 state law; the child is safely placed by the juvenile court
  3 14 with a parent; there is not a current district court order for
  3 15 custody in place; the juvenile court has determined that the
  3 16 CINA case can safely close once orders for custody, physical
  3 17 care, and visitation are entered by the district court;  and a
  3 18 parent qualified for a court=appointed attorney in the juvenile
  3 19 court case.
  3 20    If all of the criteria specified  are met, any party to a
  3 21 CINA proceeding in juvenile court may file a motion with the
  3 22 juvenile court for a bridge order. Such motion is required to
  3 23 be set for hearing no less than 30 days and not more than 90
  3 24 days from the date of filing the motion. The juvenile court,
  3 25 on its own motion, may set a hearing on the bridge order if the
  3 26 hearing is set no less than 30 days from the date of notice to
  3 27 the parties.
  3 28    The bill directs the juvenile court to designate the
  3 29 petitioner and respondent for the bridge order, which is

  3 31 and visitation.  All other matters, including child support,
  3 32 are to be filed by separate petition or by action of the child
  3 33 support recovery unit (CSRU) and are subject to existing
  3 34 applicable statutory provisions.
  3 35    Upon transferring jurisdiction, the clerk of court is
  4  1 directed to docket the case. Filing fees and other court
  4  2 costs are not to be assessed against the parties. The bill
  4  3 provides that the district court shall take judicial notice
  4  4 of the juvenile file in any hearing related to the case and
  4  5 provides for confidentiality of the records contained in the
  4  6 district court case file that were copied or transferred from
  4  7 the juvenile court file and for disclosure of the records to
  4  8 the CSRU, upon request, without a court order.
  4  9    The bill provides for modification of the bridge order for
  4 10 issues relating only to custody, physical care, or visitation.
  4 11 If the petition for modification is filed within one year of
  4 12 the filing date of the bridge order, the party requesting
  4 13 modification is not required to demonstrate a substantial
  4 14 change of circumstances,  but instead must demonstrate that
  4 15 such modification is in the best interest of the child.
  4 16 Additionally, if a petition for modification is filed within
  4 17 one year of the filing date of the bridge order, filing fees
  4 18 and other court costs are not to be assessed against the
  4 19 parties. Nothing in the bill is to be construed to require
  4 20 appointment of counsel for the parties in the district court

  2 35 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  3  1 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  3  2    This bill provides for the issuance of a bridge order to
  3  3 transfer jurisdiction related to a child in need of assistance
  3  4 (CINA) case from the juvenile court to the district court.
  3  5 Under the bill, the juvenile court may close a CINA case by
  3  6 transferring jurisdiction over the child's custody, physical
  3  7 care, and visitation to the district court through a bridge
  3  8 order, if:  the child has been adjudicated a CINA in an active
  3  9 juvenile court case, and a dispositional order in that case is
  3 10 in place;  paternity of the child has been legally established,
  3 11 including by operation of law, by order of a court of competent
  3 12 jurisdiction, or by administrative  order when authorized by
  3 13 state law; the child is safely placed by the juvenile court
  3 14 with a parent; there is not a current district court order for
  3 15 custody in place; the juvenile court has determined that the
  3 16 CINA case can safely close once orders for custody, physical
  3 17 care, and visitation are entered by the district court;  and a
  3 18 parent qualified for a court=appointed attorney in the juvenile
  3 19 court case.
  3 20    If all of the criteria specified  are met, any party to a
  3 21 CINA proceeding in juvenile court may file a motion with the
  3 22 juvenile court for a bridge order. Such motion is required to
  3 23 be set for hearing no less than 30 days and not more than 90
  3 24 days from the date of filing the motion. The juvenile court,
  3 25 on its own motion, may set a hearing on the bridge order if the
  3 26 hearing is set no less than 30 days from the date of notice to
  3 27 the parties.
  3 28    The bill directs the juvenile court to designate the
  3 29 petitioner and respondent for the bridge order, which is
  3 30 limited to addressing only matters of custody, physical care,
  3 31 and visitation.  All other matters, including child support,
  3 32 are to be filed by separate petition or by action of the child
  3 33 support recovery unit (CSRU) and are subject to existing
  3 34 applicable statutory provisions.
  3 35    Upon transferring jurisdiction, the clerk of court is
  4  1 directed to docket the case. Filing fees and other court
  4  2 costs are not to be assessed against the parties. The bill
  4  3 provides that the district court shall take judicial notice
  4  4 of the juvenile file in any hearing related to the case and
  4  5 provides for confidentiality of the records contained in the
  4  6 district court case file that were copied or transferred from
  4  7 the juvenile court file and for disclosure of the records to
  4  8 the CSRU, upon request, without a court order.
  4  9    The bill provides for modification of the bridge order for
  4 10 issues relating only to custody, physical care, or visitation.
  4 11 If the petition for modification is filed within one year of
  4 12 the filing date of the bridge order, the party requesting
  4 13 modification is not required to demonstrate a substantial
  4 14 change of circumstances,  but instead must demonstrate that
  4 15 such modification is in the best interest of the child.
  4 16 Additionally, if a petition for modification is filed within
  4 17 one year of the filing date of the bridge order, filing fees
  4 18 and other court costs are not to be assessed against the
  4 19 parties. Nothing in the bill is to be construed to require

  2 35 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  3  1 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  3  2    This bill provides for the issuance of a bridge order to
  3  3 transfer jurisdiction related to a child in need of assistance
  3  4 (CINA) case from the juvenile court to the district court.
  3  5 Under the bill, the juvenile court may close a CINA case by
  3  6 transferring jurisdiction over the child's custody, physical
  3  7 care, and visitation to the district court through a bridge
  3  8 order, if:  the child has been adjudicated a CINA in an active
  3  9 juvenile court case, and a dispositional order in that case is
  3 10 in place;  paternity of the child has been legally established,
  3 11 including by operation of law, by order of a court of competent
  3 12 jurisdiction, or by administrative  order when authorized by
  3 13 state law; the child is safely placed by the juvenile court
  3 14 with a parent; there is not a current district court order for
  3 15 custody in place; the juvenile court has determined that the
  3 16 CINA case can safely close once orders for custody, physical
  3 17 care, and visitation are entered by the district court;  and a
  3 18 parent qualified for a court=appointed attorney in the juvenile
  3 19 court case.
  3 20    If all of the criteria specified  are met, any party to a
  3 21 CINA proceeding in juvenile court may file a motion with the
  3 22 juvenile court for a bridge order. Such motion is required to
  3 23 be set for hearing no less than 30 days and not more than 90
  3 24 days from the date of filing the motion. The juvenile court,
  3 25 on its own motion, may set a hearing on the bridge order if the
  3 26 hearing is set no less than 30 days from the date of notice to
  3 27 the parties.
  3 28    The bill directs the juvenile court to designate the
  3 29 petitioner and respondent for the bridge order, which is
  3 30 limited to addressing only matters of custody, physical care,
  3 31 and visitation.  All other matters, including child support,
  3 32 are to be filed by separate petition or by action of the child
  3 33 support recovery unit (CSRU) and are subject to existing
  3 34 applicable statutory provisions.
  3 35    Upon transferring jurisdiction, the clerk of court is
  4  1 directed to docket the case. Filing fees and other court
  4  2 costs are not to be assessed against the parties. The bill
  4  3 provides that the district court shall take judicial notice
  4  4 of the juvenile file in any hearing related to the case and
  4  5 provides for confidentiality of the records contained in the
  4  6 district court case file that were copied or transferred from
  4  7 the juvenile court file and for disclosure of the records to
  4  8 the CSRU, upon request, without a court order.
  4  9    The bill provides for modification of the bridge order for
  4 10 issues relating only to custody, physical care, or visitation.
  4 11 If the petition for modification is filed within one year of
  4 12 the filing date of the bridge order, the party requesting
  4 13 modification is not required to demonstrate a substantial
  4 14 change of circumstances,  but instead must demonstrate that
  4 15 such modification is in the best interest of the child.
  4 16 Additionally, if a petition for modification is filed within
  4 17 one year of the filing date of the bridge order, filing fees
  4 18 and other court costs are not to be assessed against the
  4 19 parties. Nothing in the bill is to be construed to require
  4 20 appointment of counsel for the parties in the district court

  3  5 Under the bill, the juvenile court may close a CINA case by
  3  6 transferring jurisdiction over the child's custody, physical
  3  7 care, and visitation to the district court through a bridge
  3  8 order, if:  the child has been adjudicated a CINA in an active
  3  9 juvenile court case, and a dispositional order in that case is
  3 10 in place;  paternity of the child has been legally established,
  3 11 including by operation of law, by order of a court of competent
  3 12 jurisdiction, or by administrative  order when authorized by
  3 13 state law; the child is safely placed by the juvenile court
  3 14 with a parent; there is not a current district court order for

  3 25 on its own motion, may set a hearing on the bridge order if the
  3 26 hearing is set no less than 30 days from the date of notice to
  3 27 the parties.
  3 28    The bill directs the juvenile court to designate the
  3 29 petitioner and respondent for the bridge order, which is

  3 31 and visitation.  All other matters, including child support,
  3 32 are to be filed by separate petition or by action of the child
  3 33 support recovery unit (CSRU) and are subject to existing

  4  1 directed to docket the case. Filing fees and other court
  4  2 costs are not to be assessed against the parties. The bill
  4  3 provides that the district court shall take judicial notice

  4  7 the juvenile court file and for disclosure of the records to
  4  8 the CSRU, upon request, without a court order.

  4 13 modification is not required to demonstrate a substantial
  4 14 change of circumstances,  but instead must demonstrate that

  2 35 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  3  1 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  3  2    This bill provides for the issuance of a bridge order to
  3  3 transfer jurisdiction related to a child in need of assistance
  3  4 (CINA) case from the juvenile court to the district court.
  3  5 Under the bill, the juvenile court may close a CINA case by
  3  6 transferring jurisdiction over the child's custody, physical
  3  7 care, and visitation to the district court through a bridge
  3  8 order, if:  the child has been adjudicated a CINA in an active
  3  9 juvenile court case, and a dispositional order in that case is
  3 10 in place;  paternity of the child has been legally established,
  3 11 including by operation of law, by order of a court of competent
  3 12 jurisdiction, or by administrative  order when authorized by
  3 13 state law; the child is safely placed by the juvenile court
  3 14 with a parent; there is not a current district court order for
  3 15 custody in place; the juvenile court has determined that the
  3 16 CINA case can safely close once orders for custody, physical
  3 17 care, and visitation are entered by the district court;  and a
  3 18 parent qualified for a court=appointed attorney in the juvenile
  3 19 court case.
  3 20    If all of the criteria specified  are met, any party to a
  3 21 CINA proceeding in juvenile court may file a motion with the
  3 22 juvenile court for a bridge order. Such motion is required to
  3 23 be set for hearing no less than 30 days and not more than 90
  3 24 days from the date of filing the motion. The juvenile court,
  3 25 on its own motion, may set a hearing on the bridge order if the
  3 26 hearing is set no less than 30 days from the date of notice to
  3 27 the parties.
  3 28    The bill directs the juvenile court to designate the
  3 29 petitioner and respondent for the bridge order, which is
  3 30 limited to addressing only matters of custody, physical care,
  3 31 and visitation.  All other matters, including child support,
  3 32 are to be filed by separate petition or by action of the child
  3 33 support recovery unit (CSRU) and are subject to existing
  3 34 applicable statutory provisions.
  3 35    Upon transferring jurisdiction, the clerk of court is
  4  1 directed to docket the case. Filing fees and other court
  4  2 costs are not to be assessed against the parties. The bill
  4  3 provides that the district court shall take judicial notice
  4  4 of the juvenile file in any hearing related to the case and
  4  5 provides for confidentiality of the records contained in the
  4  6 district court case file that were copied or transferred from
  4  7 the juvenile court file and for disclosure of the records to
  4  8 the CSRU, upon request, without a court order.
  4  9    The bill provides for modification of the bridge order for
  4 10 issues relating only to custody, physical care, or visitation.
  4 11 If the petition for modification is filed within one year of
  4 12 the filing date of the bridge order, the party requesting
  4 13 modification is not required to demonstrate a substantial
  4 14 change of circumstances,  but instead must demonstrate that
  4 15 such modification is in the best interest of the child.
  4 16 Additionally, if a petition for modification is filed within
  4 17 one year of the filing date of the bridge order, filing fees
  4 18 and other court costs are not to be assessed against the
  4 19 parties. Nothing in the bill is to be construed to require

  3  2    This bill provides for the issuance of a bridge order to
  3  3 transfer jurisdiction related to a child in need of assistance
  3  4 (CINA) case from the juvenile court to the district court.
  3  5 Under the bill, the juvenile court may close a CINA case by
  3  6 transferring jurisdiction over the child's custody, physical
  3  7 care, and visitation to the district court through a bridge
  3  8 order, if:  the child has been adjudicated a CINA in an active
  3  9 juvenile court case, and a dispositional order in that case is
  3 10 in place;  paternity of the child has been legally established,
  3 11 including by operation of law, by order of a court of competent
  3 12 jurisdiction, or by administrative  order when authorized by
  3 13 state law; the child is safely placed by the juvenile court
  3 14 with a parent; there is not a current district court order for
  3 15 custody in place; the juvenile court has determined that the
  3 16 CINA case can safely close once orders for custody, physical
  3 17 care, and visitation are entered by the district court;  and a
  3 18 parent qualified for a court=appointed attorney in the juvenile
  3 19 court case.
  3 20    If all of the criteria specified  are met, any party to a
  3 21 CINA proceeding in juvenile court may file a motion with the
  3 22 juvenile court for a bridge order. Such motion is required to
  3 23 be set for hearing no less than 30 days and not more than 90
  3 24 days from the date of filing the motion. The juvenile court,
  3 25 on its own motion, may set a hearing on the bridge order if the
  3 26 hearing is set no less than 30 days from the date of notice to
  3 27 the parties.
  3 28    The bill directs the juvenile court to designate the
  3 29 petitioner and respondent for the bridge order, which is
  3 30 limited to addressing only matters of custody, physical care,
  3 31 and visitation.  All other matters, including child support,
  3 32 are to be filed by separate petition or by action of the child
  3 33 support recovery unit (CSRU) and are subject to existing
  3 34 applicable statutory provisions.
  3 35    Upon transferring jurisdiction, the clerk of court is
  4  1 directed to docket the case. Filing fees and other court
  4  2 costs are not to be assessed against the parties. The bill
  4  3 provides that the district court shall take judicial notice
  4  4 of the juvenile file in any hearing related to the case and
  4  5 provides for confidentiality of the records contained in the
  4  6 district court case file that were copied or transferred from
  4  7 the juvenile court file and for disclosure of the records to
  4  8 the CSRU, upon request, without a court order.
  4  9    The bill provides for modification of the bridge order for
  4 10 issues relating only to custody, physical care, or visitation.
  4 11 If the petition for modification is filed within one year of
  4 12 the filing date of the bridge order, the party requesting
  4 13 modification is not required to demonstrate a substantial
  4 14 change of circumstances,  but instead must demonstrate that
