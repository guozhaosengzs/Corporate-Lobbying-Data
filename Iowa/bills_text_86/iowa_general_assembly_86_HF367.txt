  1 27 the section and inserting in lieu thereof the following:
  1 28    633.78  Fiduciary written request and third=party protection.
  1 29    1.  A fiduciary under this chapter may present a written
  1 30 request to any person for the purpose of obtaining property
  1 31 owned by a decedent or by a ward of a conservatorship for
  1 32 which the fiduciary has been appointed, or property to which
  1 33 a decedent or ward is entitled, or for information about such
  1 34 property needed to perform the fiduciary's duties. The request
  1 35 must contain statements confirming all of the following:
  2  1    a.  The fiduciary's authority has not been revoked, modified,
  2  2 or amended in any manner which would cause the representations
  2  3 in the request to be incorrect.
  2  4    b.  The request has been signed by all fiduciaries acting on
  2  5 behalf of the decedent or ward.
  2  6    c.  The request has been sworn and subscribed to under
  2  7 penalty of perjury before a notary public as provided in
  2  8 chapter 9B.
  2  9    d.  A photocopy of the fiduciary's letters of appointment is
  2 10 being provided with the request.

  2 12 section may require that the fiduciary presenting the request
  2 13 provide proof of the fiduciary's identity.
  2 14    3.  A person who in good faith provides the property or
  2 15 information a fiduciary requests under this section, after
  2 16 taking reasonable steps to verify the identity of the fiduciary
  2 17 and who has no knowledge that the representations contained in
  2 18 the request are incorrect, shall not be liable to any person
  2 19 for so acting and may assume without inquiry the existence of
  2 20 the facts contained in the request. The period of time to
  2 21 verify the fiduciary's authority shall not exceed ten business
  2 22 days from the date the person received the request. Any right
  2 23 or title acquired from the fiduciary in consideration of the
  2 24 provision of property or information under this section is not
  2 25 invalid in consequence of a misapplication by the fiduciary. A
  2 26 transaction, and a lien created by a transaction, entered into
  2 27 by the fiduciary and a person acting in reliance upon a request
  2 28 under this section is enforceable against the assets for which
  2 29 the fiduciary has responsibility.
  2 30    4.  If a person refuses to provide the requested property
  2 31 or information within ten business days after receiving a
  2 32 request under this section, the fiduciary may bring an action
  2 33 to recover the property or information or compel its delivery
  2 34 against the person to whom the fiduciary presented the written
  2 35 request. An action brought under this section must be brought
  3  1 within one year after the date of the act or failure to act.
  3  2 If the court finds that the person acted unreasonably in
  3  3 failing to deliver the property or information as requested
  3  4 in the written request, the court may award any or all of the
  3  5 following to the fiduciary:
  3  6    a.  Damages sustained by the decedent's or ward's estate.
  3  7    b.  Costs of the action.
  3  8    c.  A penalty in an amount determined by the court, but
  3  9 not less than five hundred dollars or more than ten thousand
  3 10 dollars.
  3 11    d.  Reasonable attorney fees, as determined by the court,
  3 12 based on the value of the time reasonably expended by the
  3 13 attorney and not by the amount of the recovery on behalf of the
  3 14 fiduciary.
  3 15    5.  This section does not limit or change the right of
  3 16 beneficiaries, heirs, or creditors to estate property to which
  3 17 they are otherwise entitled.
