is
amended
to

that
a
cemetery
may
adopt
a
resolution
to
authorize
the
1


withdrawal
and
expenditure
of
the
principal
of
a
cemetery
2


care
fund
to
repair
boundaries;
to
purchase
equipment
for

tree,

lawn
care;

to
5


purchase
equipment
used
to
construct
a
columbarium,
mausoleum,

or
similar
structure
to
create
additional
interment
spaces.
7


The
bill
eliminates
a
requirement
that
the
repayment
schedule
8


provide
for
interest
on
the
amount
withdrawn
from
the
care
9


fund
but
if
the
deposit
of
care
fund
income
over
five
years
is
10


unlikely
to
fund
replenishment
of
the
principal
of
the
care
11


fund,
the
resolution
must
be
accompanied
by
a
bond
or
proof
of
12


insurance.
13


Code
section
523I.811(1)
is
amended
to
provide
that
14


distributions
from
the
care
fund
can
be
used
for
the
new
15


purposes
described
in
Code
section
523I.810(9).
16


New
Code
section
523I.811A
provides
that
a
perpetual
care
17


cemetery
may
make
application
to
the
commissioner
to
withdraw
18


funds
from
the
cemetery’s
care
fund
for
a
financial
emergency.
19


The
commissioner
may
allow
such
a
withdrawal
upon
finding
that
20


the
cemetery
has
an
urgent
financial
need
and
it
is
reasonable
21


and
prudent
to
fund
a
necessary
expense
of
the
cemetery.
The
22


commissioner
shall
establish
conditions
for
the
specific
use
23


of
the
funds
and
may
require
repayment
of
all
or
part
of
the
24


amount
withdrawn.
