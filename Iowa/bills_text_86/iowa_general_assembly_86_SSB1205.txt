including

The

reclassifies

as
a
schedule
II

substance
10


instead
of

adopt
12


rules
for
the
use
of
marijuana
or
tetrahydrocannabinols
for
13


medicinal
purposes.
14


A
schedule
I
controlled
substance
is
a
highly
addictive
15


substance
that
has
no
accepted
medical
use
in
the
United
States
16


and
a
schedule
II
controlled
substance
is
a
highly
addictive
17


substance
that
has
an
accepted
medical
use
in
the
United
18


States.
The
reclassification
of
marijuana
from
a
schedule
I
19


controlled
substance
to
a
schedule
II
controlled
substance
20


would
allow
a

issue
a
prescription
for
marijuana
21


under
state
law.
However,
federal
regulations
may
prohibit
22


such
prescriptions.
