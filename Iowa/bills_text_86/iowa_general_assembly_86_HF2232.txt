  4  3                           EXPLANATION
  4  4 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  4  5 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  4  6    This bill relates to the confidentiality of juvenile court
  4  7 records in delinquency proceedings.
  4  8    Under current law, juvenile court records in cases alleging
  4  9 delinquency are public records unless a judge grants a request
  4 10 to make the records confidential or seals the records.
  4 11    The bill amends current law and provides that juvenile
  4 12 court records in cases alleging delinquency are confidential
  4 13 unless a judge grants a request to make the juvenile court
  4 14 records public if the court finds, after a hearing held prior
  4 15 to disposition, that making the records public is in the
  4 16 best interests of the juvenile and the public. A rebuttable
  4 17 presumption exists that the juvenile court delinquency records
  4 18 shall remain confidential. Even if a child's juvenile court
  4 19 delinquency records are confidential, a court may, after a
  4 20 hearing, order such records to be made public records if the
  4 21 child is subsequently convicted of a felony or an aggravated
  4 22 or serious misdemeanor or adjudicated a delinquent child for
  4 23 an act which if committed by an adult would be a felony or
  4 24 an aggravated or serious misdemeanor, or if the child was
  4 25 placed on youthful offender status, transferred back to the
  4 26 district court after the youthful offender's 18th birthday,
  4 27 and sentenced for the offense which precipitated the youthful
  4 28 offender placement. If a judge orders such records to be
  4 29 public, the records may still be sealed at a later date
  4 30 pursuant to Code section 232.150.
  4 31    The bill provides that juvenile court records in cases
  4 32 alleging delinquency may be, without a court order, inspected
  4 33 by and disclosed to the judge and professional court staff, the
  4 34 child and the child's counsel, the child's parent, guardian, or
  4 35 custodian, court=appointed special advocate, and guardian ad
  5  1 litem, and the members of the child advocacy board created in
  5  2 Code section 237.16 or a local citizen foster care review board
  5  3 created in accordance with Code section 237.19, the county
  5  4 attorney and the county attorney's assistants, an agency,
  5  5 association, facility, or institution which has custody of the
  5  6 child, or is legally responsible for the care, treatment, or
  5  7 supervision of the child, a court, court professional staff,
  5  8 and adult probation officers in connection with the preparation
  5  9 of a presentence report concerning a person who prior thereto
  5 10 had been the subject of a juvenile court proceeding, the
  5 11 child's foster parent or an individual providing preadoptive
  5 12 care to the child, a law enforcement agency, and the state
  5 13 public defender.
  5 14    Under current law, records and files of a criminal or
  5 15 juvenile justice agency concerning a child involved in
  5 16 a delinquent act are public records, subject to certain
  5 17 exemptions. The bill provides that such records and files are
  5 18 confidential.
  5 19    Under current law, a complaint which alleges that a child
  5 20 who is at least 10 years of age has committed a delinquent
  5 21 act, which if committed by an adult would be a public offense,
  5 22 is a public record and is not confidential under Code section
  5 23 232.147. The bill repeals Code section 915.25 and provides
  5 24 that such a complaint is subject to Code section 232.147, and
  5 25 therefore is confidential.
  5 26    The bill retains certain existing exemptions to
  5 27 confidentiality of juvenile court records. Pursuant to Code
  5 28 section 692A.121(8), records concerning sex offense convictions
  5 29 which  are committed by minors may be released in the same
  5 30 manner as records of convictions of adults. Pursuant to Code
  5 31 section 915.10A, information concerning a juvenile charged
  5 32 with a felony offense may be released pursuant to an automated
  5 33 victim notification system.  Under the bill, these exemptions
  5 34 to confidentiality are not amended and therefore still apply to
  5 35 juvenile court records.
  6  1 The bill applies to juvenile delinquency proceedings which
  6  2 are pending or arise on or after July 1, 2016.

  3 34    Sec. 7.  APPLICABILITY.  The sections of this Act amending
  3 35 or repealing sections 232.19, 232.147, 232.149, 232.149A, and
  4  1 915.25 apply to juvenile delinquency proceedings which are
  4  2 pending or arise on or after July 1, 2016.
  4  3                           EXPLANATION
  4  4 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  4  5 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  4  6    This bill relates to the confidentiality of juvenile court
  4  7 records in delinquency proceedings.
  4  8    Under current law, juvenile court records in cases alleging
  4  9 delinquency are public records unless a judge grants a request
  4 10 to make the records confidential or seals the records.
  4 11    The bill amends current law and provides that juvenile
  4 12 court records in cases alleging delinquency are confidential
  4 13 unless a judge grants a request to make the juvenile court
  4 14 records public if the court finds, after a hearing held prior
  4 15 to disposition, that making the records public is in the
  4 16 best interests of the juvenile and the public. A rebuttable
  4 17 presumption exists that the juvenile court delinquency records
  4 18 shall remain confidential. Even if a child's juvenile court
  4 19 delinquency records are confidential, a court may, after a
  4 20 hearing, order such records to be made public records if the
  4 21 child is subsequently convicted of a felony or an aggravated
  4 22 or serious misdemeanor or adjudicated a delinquent child for

  4  6    This bill relates to the confidentiality of juvenile court
  4  7 records in delinquency proceedings.
  4  8    Under current law, juvenile court records in cases alleging
  4  9 delinquency are public records unless a judge grants a request
  4 10 to make the records confidential or seals the records.
  4 11    The bill amends current law and provides that juvenile
  4 12 court records in cases alleging delinquency are confidential
  4 13 unless a judge grants a request to make the juvenile court
  4 14 records public if the court finds, after a hearing held prior
  4 15 to disposition, that making the records public is in the
  4 16 best interests of the juvenile and the public. A rebuttable
  4 17 presumption exists that the juvenile court delinquency records
  4 18 shall remain confidential. Even if a child's juvenile court
  4 19 delinquency records are confidential, a court may, after a
  4 20 hearing, order such records to be made public records if the
  4 21 child is subsequently convicted of a felony or an aggravated
  4 22 or serious misdemeanor or adjudicated a delinquent child for
  4 23 an act which if committed by an adult would be a felony or
  4 24 an aggravated or serious misdemeanor, or if the child was
  4 25 placed on youthful offender status, transferred back to the
  4 26 district court after the youthful offender's 18th birthday,
  4 27 and sentenced for the offense which precipitated the youthful
  4 28 offender placement. If a judge orders such records to be
  4 29 public, the records may still be sealed at a later date
  4 30 pursuant to Code section 232.150.
  4 31    The bill provides that juvenile court records in cases
  4 32 alleging delinquency may be, without a court order, inspected
  4 33 by and disclosed to the judge and professional court staff, the
  4 34 child and the child's counsel, the child's parent, guardian, or
  4 35 custodian, court=appointed special advocate, and guardian ad
  5  1 litem, and the members of the child advocacy board created in
  5  2 Code section 237.16 or a local citizen foster care review board
  5  3 created in accordance with Code section 237.19, the county
  5  4 attorney and the county attorney's assistants, an agency,
  5  5 association, facility, or institution which has custody of the
  5  6 child, or is legally responsible for the care, treatment, or
  5  7 supervision of the child, a court, court professional staff,
  5  8 and adult probation officers in connection with the preparation
  5  9 of a presentence report concerning a person who prior thereto
  5 10 had been the subject of a juvenile court proceeding, the
  5 11 child's foster parent or an individual providing preadoptive
  5 12 care to the child, a law enforcement agency, and the state
  5 13 public defender.
  5 14    Under current law, records and files of a criminal or
  5 15 juvenile justice agency concerning a child involved in
  5 16 a delinquent act are public records, subject to certain
  5 17 exemptions. The bill provides that such records and files are
  5 18 confidential.
  5 19    Under current law, a complaint which alleges that a child
  5 20 who is at least 10 years of age has committed a delinquent
  5 21 act, which if committed by an adult would be a public offense,
  5 22 is a public record and is not confidential under Code section
  5 23 232.147. The bill repeals Code section 915.25 and provides
  5 24 that such a complaint is subject to Code section 232.147, and
  5 25 therefore is confidential.
  5 26    The bill retains certain existing exemptions to
  5 27 confidentiality of juvenile court records. Pursuant to Code
  5 28 section 692A.121(8), records concerning sex offense convictions
  5 29 which  are committed by minors may be released in the same
  5 30 manner as records of convictions of adults. Pursuant to Code
  5 31 section 915.10A, information concerning a juvenile charged
  5 32 with a felony offense may be released pursuant to an automated

  5 34 to confidentiality are not amended and therefore still apply to
