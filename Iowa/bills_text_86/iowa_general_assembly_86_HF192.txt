  7 10 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  7 11 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  7 12    This bill relates to property assessment for purposes of
  7 13 property taxation by modifying provisions relating to property
  7 14 assessment notices and equalization order notices and by
  7 15 modifying provisions relating to property assessment protests
  7 16 and assessor informal reviews.
  7 17    Current Code section 441.30 allows a property owner or
  7 18 taxpayer to contact the assessor to inquire about the specifics
  7 19 and accuracy of the assessment and to request an informal
  7 20 review of the assessment on or after April 1 to and including
  7 21 May 4 of the assessment year.  The bill modifies that period
  7 22 of time to be on or after April 2 to and including April 25.
  7 23 The bill also authorizes a change to the assessment on or
  7 24 before April 25 if the owner or taxpayer enters into a written
  7 25 agreement with the assessor. This authority is in addition
  7 26 to the assessor's current authority to recommend that the
  7 27 taxpayer file a protest with the local board of review and file
  7 28 a recommendation in regards to such a protest.
  7 29    The bill also modifies the period of time for filing an
  7 30 assessment protest with the local board of review from the
  7 31 current April 7 to May 5, to a period of time beginning April 2
  7 32 to and including April 30.
  7 33    Current Code section 441.26 requires notices of equalization
  7 34 orders to be published in the newspaper on or before
  7 35 October 15.  The bill modifies the publication deadline for
  8  1 equalization order notices to October 8 and requires that
  8  2 individual notices be mailed by October 8 to each owner or
  8  3 taxpayer whose valuation has been increased by the equalization
  8  4 order. The bill provides that the notice shall contain the
  8  5 statement currently required in published notices and amends
  8  6 Code section 441.49 to also require that the notice contain a
  8  7 statement of the owner's or taxpayer's ability to file with the
  8  8 local board of review a protest against an assessment adjusted
  8  9 by the equalization order.
  8 10    The bill also amends Code section 441.49 to modify the
  8 11 period of time for taxpayer protests of an equalization order
  8 12 and the dates of the local board of review's session to hear
  8 13 such protests. Current law allows such protests to be filed
  8 14 on or after October 15, to and including October 25. The bill
  8 15 makes the period of time for filing a protest from October 9 to
  8 16 October 31.  The bill changes the dates during which the local
  8 17 board is in session to hear assessment protests resulting from
  8 18 equalization orders to be October 15 to November 30 (previously
  8 19 October 15 to November 15). The bill also provides that the
  8 20 deadline for completing the appeal procedures for equalizations
  8 21 implemented by the assessing jurisdiction using an alternative
  8 22 method of applying the equalization order is December 15
  8 23 instead of November 30.
  8 24    Code section 441.35 provides that if the assessment of any
  8 25 property is raised during the local board of review's meeting
  8 26 in the even=numbered year, the clerk shall give notice by
  8 27 mail in the manner provided in Code section 441.36.  The bill
  8 28 requires the mail notice for all property where the value has
  8 29 changed.
  8 30    Code section 441.35, subsection 2, also authorizes the local
  8 31 board of review to provide notice to taxpayers by publication
  8 32 in one of the official newspapers located in the taxing
  8 33 district if the local board of review raises the assessment
  8 34 of all property in a taxing district during the local board
  8 35 of review's session in an even=numbered assessment year.
  9  1 The bill modifies this provision to require, in addition to
  9  2 individual owner or taxpayer notices, notice by publication if
  9  3 all property in the taxing district is revalued and reassessed.
  9  4    The bill amends Code section 441.37 to require individual
  9  5 assessment notices and published notices resulting from an
  9  6 equalization order to include information on the availability
  9  7 of electronic filing of protests if electronic filing is
  9  8 authorized by the local board of review.
  9  9    The bill may include a state mandate as defined in Code
  9 10 section 25B.3. The bill makes inapplicable Code section 25B.2,
  9 11 subsection 3, which would relieve a political subdivision from
  9 12 complying with a state mandate if funding for the cost of
  9 13 the state mandate is not provided or specified. Therefore,
  9 14 political subdivisions are required to comply with any state
  9 15 mandate included in the bill.
  9 16    The bill applies to assessment years beginning on or after
  9 17 January 1, 2016.

  7 10 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  7 11 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  7 12    This bill relates to property assessment for purposes of
  7 13 property taxation by modifying provisions relating to property
  7 14 assessment notices and equalization order notices and by
  7 15 modifying provisions relating to property assessment protests
  7 16 and assessor informal reviews.
  7 17    Current Code section 441.30 allows a property owner or
  7 18 taxpayer to contact the assessor to inquire about the specifics
  7 19 and accuracy of the assessment and to request an informal
  7 20 review of the assessment on or after April 1 to and including
  7 21 May 4 of the assessment year.  The bill modifies that period
  7 22 of time to be on or after April 2 to and including April 25.
  7 23 The bill also authorizes a change to the assessment on or
  7 24 before April 25 if the owner or taxpayer enters into a written
  7 25 agreement with the assessor. This authority is in addition
  7 26 to the assessor's current authority to recommend that the
  7 27 taxpayer file a protest with the local board of review and file
  7 28 a recommendation in regards to such a protest.
  7 29    The bill also modifies the period of time for filing an
  7 30 assessment protest with the local board of review from the
  7 31 current April 7 to May 5, to a period of time beginning April 2
  7 32 to and including April 30.
  7 33    Current Code section 441.26 requires notices of equalization
  7 34 orders to be published in the newspaper on or before
  7 35 October 15.  The bill modifies the publication deadline for
  8  1 equalization order notices to October 8 and requires that
  8  2 individual notices be mailed by October 8 to each owner or
  8  3 taxpayer whose valuation has been increased by the equalization
  8  4 order. The bill provides that the notice shall contain the
  8  5 statement currently required in published notices and amends
  8  6 Code section 441.49 to also require that the notice contain a
  8  7 statement of the owner's or taxpayer's ability to file with the
  8  8 local board of review a protest against an assessment adjusted
  8  9 by the equalization order.
  8 10    The bill also amends Code section 441.49 to modify the
  8 11 period of time for taxpayer protests of an equalization order
  8 12 and the dates of the local board of review's session to hear
  8 13 such protests. Current law allows such protests to be filed
  8 14 on or after October 15, to and including October 25. The bill
  8 15 makes the period of time for filing a protest from October 9 to
  8 16 October 31.  The bill changes the dates during which the local
  8 17 board is in session to hear assessment protests resulting from
  8 18 equalization orders to be October 15 to November 30 (previously
  8 19 October 15 to November 15). The bill also provides that the
  8 20 deadline for completing the appeal procedures for equalizations
  8 21 implemented by the assessing jurisdiction using an alternative
  8 22 method of applying the equalization order is December 15
  8 23 instead of November 30.
  8 24    Code section 441.35 provides that if the assessment of any
  8 25 property is raised during the local board of review's meeting
  8 26 in the even=numbered year, the clerk shall give notice by
  8 27 mail in the manner provided in Code section 441.36.  The bill
  8 28 requires the mail notice for all property where the value has
  8 29 changed.
  8 30    Code section 441.35, subsection 2, also authorizes the local
  8 31 board of review to provide notice to taxpayers by publication
  8 32 in one of the official newspapers located in the taxing
  8 33 district if the local board of review raises the assessment
  8 34 of all property in a taxing district during the local board
  8 35 of review's session in an even=numbered assessment year.
  9  1 The bill modifies this provision to require, in addition to
  9  2 individual owner or taxpayer notices, notice by publication if
  9  3 all property in the taxing district is revalued and reassessed.
  9  4    The bill amends Code section 441.37 to require individual
  9  5 assessment notices and published notices resulting from an
  9  6 equalization order to include information on the availability
  9  7 of electronic filing of protests if electronic filing is
  9  8 authorized by the local board of review.
  9  9    The bill may include a state mandate as defined in Code
  9 10 section 25B.3. The bill makes inapplicable Code section 25B.2,
  9 11 subsection 3, which would relieve a political subdivision from
  9 12 complying with a state mandate if funding for the cost of
  9 13 the state mandate is not provided or specified. Therefore,
  9 14 political subdivisions are required to comply with any state
  9 15 mandate included in the bill.
  9 16    The bill applies to assessment years beginning on or after
  9 17 January 1, 2016.

  7 13 property taxation by modifying provisions relating to property
  7 14 assessment notices and equalization order notices and by
  7 15 modifying provisions relating to property assessment protests
  7 16 and assessor informal reviews.
  7 17    Current Code section 441.30 allows a property owner or
  7 18 taxpayer to contact the assessor to inquire about the specifics
  7 19 and accuracy of the assessment and to request an informal
  7 20 review of the assessment on or after April 1 to and including
  7 21 May 4 of the assessment year.  The bill modifies that period
  7 22 of time to be on or after April 2 to and including April 25.
  7 23 The bill also authorizes a change to the assessment on or
  7 24 before April 25 if the owner or taxpayer enters into a written
  7 25 agreement with the assessor. This authority is in addition
  7 26 to the assessor's current authority to recommend that the
  7 27 taxpayer file a protest with the local board of review and file
  7 28 a recommendation in regards to such a protest.
  7 29    The bill also modifies the period of time for filing an
  7 30 assessment protest with the local board of review from the
  7 31 current April 7 to May 5, to a period of time beginning April 2

  7 33    Current Code section 441.26 requires notices of equalization
  7 34 orders to be published in the newspaper on or before
  7 35 October 15.  The bill modifies the publication deadline for
  8  1 equalization order notices to October 8 and requires that
  8  2 individual notices be mailed by October 8 to each owner or
  8  3 taxpayer whose valuation has been increased by the equalization
  8  4 order. The bill provides that the notice shall contain the
  8  5 statement currently required in published notices and amends
  8  6 Code section 441.49 to also require that the notice contain a
  8  7 statement of the owner's or taxpayer's ability to file with the
  8  8 local board of review a protest against an assessment adjusted
  8  9 by the equalization order.
  8 10    The bill also amends Code section 441.49 to modify the
  8 11 period of time for taxpayer protests of an equalization order
  8 12 and the dates of the local board of review's session to hear
  8 13 such protests. Current law allows such protests to be filed
  8 14 on or after October 15, to and including October 25. The bill
  8 15 makes the period of time for filing a protest from October 9 to
  8 16 October 31.  The bill changes the dates during which the local
  8 17 board is in session to hear assessment protests resulting from
  8 18 equalization orders to be October 15 to November 30 (previously
  8 19 October 15 to November 15). The bill also provides that the
  8 20 deadline for completing the appeal procedures for equalizations
  8 21 implemented by the assessing jurisdiction using an alternative
  8 22 method of applying the equalization order is December 15
  8 23 instead of November 30.
  8 24    Code section 441.35 provides that if the assessment of any
  8 25 property is raised during the local board of review's meeting
  8 26 in the even=numbered year, the clerk shall give notice by
  8 27 mail in the manner provided in Code section 441.36.  The bill
  8 28 requires the mail notice for all property where the value has
  8 29 changed.
  8 30    Code section 441.35, subsection 2, also authorizes the local
  8 31 board of review to provide notice to taxpayers by publication
  8 32 in one of the official newspapers located in the taxing
  8 33 district if the local board of review raises the assessment
  8 34 of all property in a taxing district during the local board
  8 35 of review's session in an even=numbered assessment year.
  9  1 The bill modifies this provision to require, in addition to
  9  2 individual owner or taxpayer notices, notice by publication if
  9  3 all property in the taxing district is revalued and reassessed.
  9  4    The bill amends Code section 441.37 to require individual
  9  5 assessment notices and published notices resulting from an
  9  6 equalization order to include information on the availability
  9  7 of electronic filing of protests if electronic filing is
  9  8 authorized by the local board of review.
  9  9    The bill may include a state mandate as defined in Code
  9 10 section 25B.3. The bill makes inapplicable Code section 25B.2,
  9 11 subsection 3, which would relieve a political subdivision from
  9 12 complying with a state mandate if funding for the cost of
  9 13 the state mandate is not provided or specified. Therefore,
  9 14 political subdivisions are required to comply with any state
  9 15 mandate included in the bill.

  9 17 January 1, 2016.

  8  3 taxpayer whose valuation has been increased by the equalization
  8  4 order. The bill provides that the notice shall contain the

  8  6 Code section 441.49 to also require that the notice contain a
  8  7 statement of the owner's or taxpayer's ability to file with the
  8  8 local board of review a protest against an assessment adjusted
  8  9 by the equalization order.
  8 10    The bill also amends Code section 441.49 to modify the
  8 11 period of time for taxpayer protests of an equalization order
  8 12 and the dates of the local board of review's session to hear
  8 13 such protests. Current law allows such protests to be filed
  8 14 on or after October 15, to and including October 25. The bill
  8 15 makes the period of time for filing a protest from October 9 to
  8 16 October 31.  The bill changes the dates during which the local
  8 17 board is in session to hear assessment protests resulting from
  8 18 equalization orders to be October 15 to November 30 (previously
  8 19 October 15 to November 15). The bill also provides that the
  8 20 deadline for completing the appeal procedures for equalizations
  8 21 implemented by the assessing jurisdiction using an alternative
  8 22 method of applying the equalization order is December 15
  8 23 instead of November 30.
  8 24    Code section 441.35 provides that if the assessment of any
  8 25 property is raised during the local board of review's meeting
  8 26 in the even=numbered year, the clerk shall give notice by

  8 30    Code section 441.35, subsection 2, also authorizes the local
  8 31 board of review to provide notice to taxpayers by publication
  8 32 in one of the official newspapers located in the taxing
  8 33 district if the local board of review raises the assessment
  8 34 of all property in a taxing district during the local board
  8 35 of review's session in an even=numbered assessment year.
  9  1 The bill modifies this provision to require, in addition to

  9  4    The bill amends Code section 441.37 to require individual
  9  5 assessment notices and published notices resulting from an
  9  6 equalization order to include information on the availability

  9 11 subsection 3, which would relieve a political subdivision from
  9 12 complying with a state mandate if funding for the cost of

  7 10 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  7 11 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  7 12    This bill relates to property assessment for purposes of
  7 13 property taxation by modifying provisions relating to property
  7 14 assessment notices and equalization order notices and by
  7 15 modifying provisions relating to property assessment protests
  7 16 and assessor informal reviews.
  7 17    Current Code section 441.30 allows a property owner or
  7 18 taxpayer to contact the assessor to inquire about the specifics
  7 19 and accuracy of the assessment and to request an informal
  7 20 review of the assessment on or after April 1 to and including
  7 21 May 4 of the assessment year.  The bill modifies that period
  7 22 of time to be on or after April 2 to and including April 25.
  7 23 The bill also authorizes a change to the assessment on or
  7 24 before April 25 if the owner or taxpayer enters into a written
  7 25 agreement with the assessor. This authority is in addition
  7 26 to the assessor's current authority to recommend that the
  7 27 taxpayer file a protest with the local board of review and file
  7 28 a recommendation in regards to such a protest.
  7 29    The bill also modifies the period of time for filing an

  7 33    Current Code section 441.26 requires notices of equalization
  7 34 orders to be published in the newspaper on or before

  8  1 equalization order notices to October 8 and requires that
  8  2 individual notices be mailed by October 8 to each owner or
  8  3 taxpayer whose valuation has been increased by the equalization
  8  4 order. The bill provides that the notice shall contain the
  8  5 statement currently required in published notices and amends
  8  6 Code section 441.49 to also require that the notice contain a
  8  7 statement of the owner's or taxpayer's ability to file with the
  8  8 local board of review a protest against an assessment adjusted
  8  9 by the equalization order.
  8 10    The bill also amends Code section 441.49 to modify the
  8 11 period of time for taxpayer protests of an equalization order
  8 12 and the dates of the local board of review's session to hear
  8 13 such protests. Current law allows such protests to be filed
  8 14 on or after October 15, to and including October 25. The bill
  8 15 makes the period of time for filing a protest from October 9 to
  8 16 October 31.  The bill changes the dates during which the local
  8 17 board is in session to hear assessment protests resulting from
  8 18 equalization orders to be October 15 to November 30 (previously
  8 19 October 15 to November 15). The bill also provides that the
  8 20 deadline for completing the appeal procedures for equalizations
  8 21 implemented by the assessing jurisdiction using an alternative
  8 22 method of applying the equalization order is December 15
  8 23 instead of November 30.
  8 24    Code section 441.35 provides that if the assessment of any
  8 25 property is raised during the local board of review's meeting
  8 26 in the even=numbered year, the clerk shall give notice by
  8 27 mail in the manner provided in Code section 441.36.  The bill
  8 28 requires the mail notice for all property where the value has
  8 29 changed.
  8 30    Code section 441.35, subsection 2, also authorizes the local
  8 31 board of review to provide notice to taxpayers by publication
  8 32 in one of the official newspapers located in the taxing
  8 33 district if the local board of review raises the assessment
  8 34 of all property in a taxing district during the local board
  8 35 of review's session in an even=numbered assessment year.
  9  1 The bill modifies this provision to require, in addition to

  9  3 all property in the taxing district is revalued and reassessed.
  9  4    The bill amends Code section 441.37 to require individual
  9  5 assessment notices and published notices resulting from an
  9  6 equalization order to include information on the availability

  8 15 makes the period of time for filing a protest from October 9 to
  8 16 October 31.  The bill changes the dates during which the local
  8 17 board is in session to hear assessment protests resulting from
  8 18 equalization orders to be October 15 to November 30 (previously
  8 19 October 15 to November 15). The bill also provides that the
  8 20 deadline for completing the appeal procedures for equalizations
  8 21 implemented by the assessing jurisdiction using an alternative
  8 22 method of applying the equalization order is December 15
  8 23 instead of November 30.
  8 24    Code section 441.35 provides that if the assessment of any
  8 25 property is raised during the local board of review's meeting
  8 26 in the even=numbered year, the clerk shall give notice by
  8 27 mail in the manner provided in Code section 441.36.  The bill

  8 33 district if the local board of review raises the assessment
  8 34 of all property in a taxing district during the local board
  8 35 of review's session in an even=numbered assessment year.
  9  1 The bill modifies this provision to require, in addition to
  9  2 individual owner or taxpayer notices, notice by publication if
  9  3 all property in the taxing district is revalued and reassessed.
  9  4    The bill amends Code section 441.37 to require individual
  9  5 assessment notices and published notices resulting from an

  8  1 equalization order notices to October 8 and requires that
  8  2 individual notices be mailed by October 8 to each owner or
  8  3 taxpayer whose valuation has been increased by the equalization

  8  5 statement currently required in published notices and amends
  8  6 Code section 441.49 to also require that the notice contain a
  8  7 statement of the owner's or taxpayer's ability to file with the
  8  8 local board of review a protest against an assessment adjusted
  8  9 by the equalization order.
  8 10    The bill also amends Code section 441.49 to modify the
  8 11 period of time for taxpayer protests of an equalization order
  8 12 and the dates of the local board of review's session to hear
  8 13 such protests. Current law allows such protests to be filed
  8 14 on or after October 15, to and including October 25. The bill
  8 15 makes the period of time for filing a protest from October 9 to

  8 28 requires the mail notice for all property where the value has
  8 29 changed.
  8 30    Code section 441.35, subsection 2, also authorizes the local
  8 31 board of review to provide notice to taxpayers by publication
  8 32 in one of the official newspapers located in the taxing
  8 33 district if the local board of review raises the assessment
  8 34 of all property in a taxing district during the local board
  8 35 of review's session in an even=numbered assessment year.
  9  1 The bill modifies this provision to require, in addition to

  9  4    The bill amends Code section 441.37 to require individual
  9  5 assessment notices and published notices resulting from an

  9 11 subsection 3, which would relieve a political subdivision from

  8 12 and the dates of the local board of review's session to hear
