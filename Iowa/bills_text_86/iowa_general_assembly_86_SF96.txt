  6 10                           EXPLANATION
  6 11 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  6 12 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  6 13    This bill provides for the legal sale and use of consumer
  6 14 fireworks within the state.
  6 15    The bill provides for the licensure of consumer fireworks
  6 16 operators by the division of the state fire marshal of the
  6 17 department of public safety.  The bill provides that a person
  6 18 may not purchase, operate, or explode fireworks within the
  6 19 state without being licensed under the bill.  The bill provides
  6 20 that a person must be at least 18 years of age, have completed
  6 21 a fireworks safety education program, and paid a fee of $41
  6 22 in order to receive a license pursuant to the bill.  The bill
  6 23 provides that a license will not be for longer than one year.
  6 24 The bill provides that the state fire marshal shall adopt
  6 25 rules for the revocation or suspension of a fireworks operator
  6 26 license and for the administration of the bill.
  6 27    The bill provides for the creation of a fireworks safety
  6 28 education program.  The bill provides that successful
  6 29 completion of the program is required in order to be issued a
  6 30 fireworks operator license.  The bill provides that a person
  6 31 may enroll in the program upon reaching the age of 17.  The
  6 32 bill states that any certificate of completion issued to a
  6 33 person under the age of 18 will not become valid until the
  6 34 person reaches the age of 18.  A certificate of completion
  6 35 will not be issued to a person who has not satisfactorily
  7  1 completed the requirements of the program, as adopted by the
  7  2 state fire marshal.  The state fire marshal shall establish the
  7  3 curriculum for the program.  The program instructor shall issue
  7  4 a certificate of completion based upon passage of the test and
  7  5 upon demonstrated safe handling of fireworks.
  7  6    The bill provides that the division shall administer
  7  7 individual oral or written tests, and that the division shall
  7  8 require passage of the test in order to issue a certificate of
  7  9 completion.  The state fire marshal shall establish criteria
  7 10 for passing.
  7 11    The department of public safety shall provide a manual for
  7 12 fireworks safety to be used by all instructors and persons
  7 13 receiving fireworks safety training.  The department may
  7 14 produce this manual in either print or electronic form.
  7 15    The division of the state fire marshal shall provide for the
  7 16 certification of instructors.  The bill allows for an officer
  7 17 of the department or an instructor to issue a certificate of
  7 18 completion to any person who has not completed the program but
  7 19 who meets other criteria established by the state fire marshal.
  7 20    The bill provides that a person who obtained a license by
  7 21 providing false information or a fraudulent certificate shall
  7 22 have the license revoked and the person shall not be issued a
  7 23 license for at least two years from the date of revocation.
  7 24 The bill also provides for the revocation of licenses where a
  7 25 licensee has not met the requirements of the bill.  The bill
  7 26 provides that the initial certificate shall be issued at no
  7 27 cost, but that duplicate certificates shall cost $3.  The bill
  7 28 provides that enrollment within the program shall be free for a
  7 29 person's initial enrollment, but that any subsequent enrollment
  7 30 shall result in a $100 fee.
  7 31    The bill allows the state fire marshal to designate license
  7 32 agents.  The bill provides for the distribution of the
  7 33 fireworks operator license fees.  From each $41 license fee,
  7 34 $1 will be directed to the division of the fire marshal, $10
  7 35 will be directed to fire departments throughout the state as
  8  1 designated by the fire marshal, $10 will be directed to public
  8  2 school districts throughout the state as designated by the fire
  8  3 marshal, and $20 will be directed to the general fund of the
  8  4 state.
  8  5    The bill provides that a person who does not possess a valid
  8  6 fireworks operator license shall not be allowed to operate
  8  7 fireworks.  The bill provides that fireworks may only be
  8  8 operated during certain months and certain holiday weekends.
  8  9 The bill provides that the state fire marshal may, when
  8 10 warranted, declare the operation of fireworks to be a threat
  8 11 to public safety.  Operation of fireworks during the time of
  8 12 such a declaration is not permitted.  The bill provides that
  8 13 a person shall not operate, ignite, or store fireworks in an
  8 14 unsafe manner as described in the fireworks safety manual.  The
  8 15 bill requires that any person violating these provisions have
  8 16 their license suspended and be required to successfully retake
  8 17 the fireworks safety education course before the person could
  8 18 be issued another license.  The bill also provides that any
  8 19 person violating the provisions is subject to a civil penalty
  8 20 not to exceed $300 per offense.
  8 21    The bill also provides for the permitting of fireworks
  8 22 sales.  The division shall issue such permits and shall not
  8 23 provide such permits to persons under the age of 18. The
  8 24 bill requires that these permits be displayed by the vendor
  8 25 conspicuously.  The bill requires that the fire marshal adopt
  8 26 rules to regulate fireworks vendors and the sale of fireworks.
  8 27    The bill amends criminal provisions related to fireworks to
