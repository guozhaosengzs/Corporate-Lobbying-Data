  4  1 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  4  2 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  4  3    This bill relates to county recorder duties and fees.
  4  4    The bill requires county recorders to carry out duties

  4  7 of the county land record information system, and including but
  4  8 not limited to the current statutory policies, procedures, and
  4  9 duties relating to land records.
  4 10    The bill provides that participation in the county land
  4 11 record information system shall be established pursuant to
  4 12 an agreement entered into by all counties in this state and
  4 13 makes changes to what constitutes allowable expenditures
  4 14 from the local government electronic transaction fund. The
  4 15 bill requires that the county recorder collect a $2 fee for
  4 16 each recorded transaction to be used for purposes currently
  4 17 specified in statute. Under current law, the fee is set at $1.
  4 18 The bill also specifies an additional allowable use of such
  4 19 fees, for establishing and implementing standards for local
  4 20 land records management systems.
  4 21    Under current law, a county recorder or the governing board
  4 22 of the county land record information system is authorized to
  4 23 collect any actual third=party fees associated with accepting
  4 24 and processing payment of fees the recorder or system is
  4 25 authorized to collect. The bill, however, strikes that
  4 26 provision and instead provides that a recorder or the governing
  4 27 board of the county land record information system may collect
  4 28 a fee for costs related to the use of credit cards and debit
  4 29 cards. The bill further requires that the legislature review

  4 22 of the county land record information system is authorized to
