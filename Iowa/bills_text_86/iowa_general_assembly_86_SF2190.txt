  1  3    Section 1.  COUNTY CHEMICAL SUBSTANCE ABUSE MONITORING PILOT
  1  4 PROGRAMS.
  1  5    1.  The department of public safety, in collaboration with
  1  6 the governor's traffic safety bureau, may, in an effort to
  1  7 reduce the number of crimes that have a nexus with chemical
  1  8 substance abuse, adopt rules providing for the creation and
  1  9 approval of an application from a county for the implementation
  1 10 of a countywide chemical substance abuse monitoring pilot
  1 11 program that is available twenty=four hours per day, seven days
  1 12 per week.
  1 13    2.  A chemical substance abuse monitoring pilot program
  1 14 shall do all of the following:
  1 15    a.  Make the program available to a person who has been
  1 16 charged with, pled guilty to, or been convicted of a crime
  1 17 that has a nexus with chemical substance abuse. The program
  1 18 shall require a participating person to abstain from all
  1 19 chemical substances for a period of time. A person wishing
  1 20 to participate in the program shall apply to the court on
  1 21 a form designed by the county, and the court may order the
  1 22 person's participation in the program as a component or
  1 23 condition of pretrial release or probation. The application
  1 24 form shall include an itemization of all costs associated with
  1 25 participation in the program. This paragraph shall not apply
  1 26 to a person who has been charged with, pled guilty to, or been
  1 27 convicted of a first offense of operating while intoxicated
  1 28 in violation of section 321J.2 where the person's alcohol
  1 29 concentration was lower than .15 and no accident resulting
  1 30 in personal injury or property damage occurred, unless upon
  1 31 application and a hearing the court permits participation in
  1 32 the program by such a person.
  1 33    b.  Require the person to be subject to testing to determine
  1 34 whether a chemical substance is present in the person's body.
  1 35 The commissioner of public safety shall approve the use of
  2  1 appropriate devices and technology for this purpose, and may,
  2  2 in the case of alcohol concentration testing, designate certain
  2  3 portable breath test devices for this purpose. Testing shall
  2  4 occur in the following manner:
  2  5    (1)  At least twice per day at a central location.
  2  6    (2)  Where testing under subparagraph (1) is impractical, by
  2  7 continuous transdermal or electronic monitoring.
  2  8    c.  Provide that allegations of a test failure, a refusal to
  2  9 submit to a test, or a failure to appear for testing shall be
  2 10 communicated ex parte to a magistrate as soon as practicable.
  2 11 A magistrate who receives such a communication may order
  2 12 immediate incarceration pending a hearing on the allegation but
  2 13 lasting no longer than twenty=four hours after the issuance of
  2 14 the order or, if the person failed to appear for testing as
  2 15 scheduled, the magistrate may issue a warrant for the arrest of
  2 16 the person for a violation of the terms of pretrial release or
  2 17 probation, as applicable.
  2 18    d.  Require a person participating in the program to pay
  2 19 program costs, including costs of installation, monitoring, and
  2 20 deactivation of any testing devices.
  2 21    3.  An approved pilot program shall begin on October 1, 2016,
  2 22 or upon the effective date of department rules, whichever is
  2 23 earlier, and shall be conducted for a minimum of one year.
  2 24    4.  The department of public safety shall adopt rules
  2 25 pursuant to chapter 17A to implement this section including
  2 26 but not limited to provisions relating to applications for,
  2 27 approval of, costs of, and oversight of the pilot programs and
  2 28 reporting requirements for participating counties.
  2 29    5.  The department of public safety shall submit a report on
  2 30 the results of the pilot programs and make recommendations to
  2 31 the general assembly by December 15, 2017.
  2 32    6.  For the purposes of this section, "chemical substance"
  2 33 means any alcoholic beverage as defined in section 321J.1 and
  2 34 any controlled substance as defined in section 124.101.
