  2 34    This bill enacts new Code section 729.7 to prohibit a
  2 35 government entity from burdening a person's exercise of
  3  1 religion, even if the burden results from a law of general
  3  2 applicability, unless the government entity can demonstrate
  3  3 that the action constituting or resulting in the burden
  3  4 furthers a compelling governmental interest and is the least
  3  5 restrictive means of furthering that interest.

  3  4 furthers a compelling governmental interest and is the least

  3 11 state government, or any official or other person acting under
  3 12 color of state law, or any political subdivision of the state.
  3 13    The provisions of the bill do not authorize any government
  3 14 entity to burden any religious belief and do not affect any
  3 15 portions of Article I, section 3 of the Constitution of the

  3 23 or monetary damages. A person who prevails in any proceeding
  3 24 to enforce the provisions of new Code section 729.7 against a

  3 26 reasonable attorney fees, except that attorney fees may not be
  3 27 recovered in cases of criminal prosecution.
  3 28    The bill provides that a person found to have abused new

  3 30 may be assessed the government entity's court costs and
  3 31 may be enjoined from filing further claims without leave of
  3 32 court. The bill defines "fraudulent claim" as a claim that is
  3 33 dishonest in fact or that is made principally for a patently
  3 34 improper purpose, such as to harass the opposing party. The
  3 35 bill defines "frivolous claim" as a claim that completely lacks
  4  1 merit under existing law and cannot be supported by a good
  4  2 faith argument for the extension, modification, or reversal of
  4  3 existing law or the establishment of new law.

  2 31                           EXPLANATION
  2 32 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  2 33 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  2 34    This bill enacts new Code section 729.7 to prohibit a
  2 35 government entity from burdening a person's exercise of
  3  1 religion, even if the burden results from a law of general
  3  2 applicability, unless the government entity can demonstrate
  3  3 that the action constituting or resulting in the burden
  3  4 furthers a compelling governmental interest and is the least
  3  5 restrictive means of furthering that interest.
  3  6    The bill defines "exercise of religion" as the practice
  3  7 or observance of religion under Article I, section 3 of the
  3  8 Constitution of the State of Iowa or the First Amendment to
  3  9 the United States Constitution. The bill defines "government
  3 10 entity" as any branch, department, agency, instrumentality of
  3 11 state government, or any official or other person acting under
  3 12 color of state law, or any political subdivision of the state.
  3 13    The provisions of the bill do not authorize any government
  3 14 entity to burden any religious belief and do not affect any
  3 15 portions of Article I, section 3 of the Constitution of the
  3 16 State of Iowa or the First Amendment to the United States
  3 17 Constitution that prohibit laws respecting the establishment
  3 18 of religion.
  3 19    The bill provides that a person whose exercise of religion
  3 20 has been burdened by a government entity may assert a violation
  3 21 of new Code section 729.7 as a claim or defense in any judicial
  3 22 or administrative proceeding and may obtain declaratory relief
  3 23 or monetary damages. A person who prevails in any proceeding
  3 24 to enforce the provisions of new Code section 729.7 against a
  3 25 government entity may recover all costs of the action including
  3 26 reasonable attorney fees, except that attorney fees may not be
  3 27 recovered in cases of criminal prosecution.
  3 28    The bill provides that a person found to have abused new
  3 29 Code section 729.7 by filing a frivolous or fraudulent claim
  3 30 may be assessed the government entity's court costs and
  3 31 may be enjoined from filing further claims without leave of
  3 32 court. The bill defines "fraudulent claim" as a claim that is
  3 33 dishonest in fact or that is made principally for a patently
  3 34 improper purpose, such as to harass the opposing party. The
  3 35 bill defines "frivolous claim" as a claim that completely lacks
  4  1 merit under existing law and cannot be supported by a good
  4  2 faith argument for the extension, modification, or reversal of
  4  3 existing law or the establishment of new law.

  2 32 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  2 33 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  2 34    This bill enacts new Code section 729.7 to prohibit a
  2 35 government entity from burdening a person's exercise of
  3  1 religion, even if the burden results from a law of general
  3  2 applicability, unless the government entity can demonstrate
  3  3 that the action constituting or resulting in the burden
  3  4 furthers a compelling governmental interest and is the least
  3  5 restrictive means of furthering that interest.
  3  6    The bill defines "exercise of religion" as the practice
  3  7 or observance of religion under Article I, section 3 of the
  3  8 Constitution of the State of Iowa or the First Amendment to
  3  9 the United States Constitution. The bill defines "government
  3 10 entity" as any branch, department, agency, instrumentality of
  3 11 state government, or any official or other person acting under
  3 12 color of state law, or any political subdivision of the state.
  3 13    The provisions of the bill do not authorize any government
  3 14 entity to burden any religious belief and do not affect any
  3 15 portions of Article I, section 3 of the Constitution of the

  3 17 Constitution that prohibit laws respecting the establishment

  3 22 or administrative proceeding and may obtain declaratory relief
  3 23 or monetary damages. A person who prevails in any proceeding
  3 24 to enforce the provisions of new Code section 729.7 against a
  3 25 government entity may recover all costs of the action including
  3 26 reasonable attorney fees, except that attorney fees may not be
  3 27 recovered in cases of criminal prosecution.
  3 28    The bill provides that a person found to have abused new
  3 29 Code section 729.7 by filing a frivolous or fraudulent claim
  3 30 may be assessed the government entity's court costs and
  3 31 may be enjoined from filing further claims without leave of
  3 32 court. The bill defines "fraudulent claim" as a claim that is
  3 33 dishonest in fact or that is made principally for a patently
  3 34 improper purpose, such as to harass the opposing party. The
  3 35 bill defines "frivolous claim" as a claim that completely lacks
  4  1 merit under existing law and cannot be supported by a good
  4  2 faith argument for the extension, modification, or reversal of
  4  3 existing law or the establishment of new law.

  2 32 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  2 33 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  2 34    This bill enacts new Code section 729.7 to prohibit a
  2 35 government entity from burdening a person's exercise of
  3  1 religion, even if the burden results from a law of general
  3  2 applicability, unless the government entity can demonstrate
  3  3 that the action constituting or resulting in the burden
  3  4 furthers a compelling governmental interest and is the least
  3  5 restrictive means of furthering that interest.
  3  6    The bill defines "exercise of religion" as the practice
  3  7 or observance of religion under Article I, section 3 of the
  3  8 Constitution of the State of Iowa or the First Amendment to
  3  9 the United States Constitution. The bill defines "government
  3 10 entity" as any branch, department, agency, instrumentality of
  3 11 state government, or any official or other person acting under
  3 12 color of state law, or any political subdivision of the state.
  3 13    The provisions of the bill do not authorize any government
  3 14 entity to burden any religious belief and do not affect any
  3 15 portions of Article I, section 3 of the Constitution of the
  3 16 State of Iowa or the First Amendment to the United States
  3 17 Constitution that prohibit laws respecting the establishment
  3 18 of religion.
  3 19    The bill provides that a person whose exercise of religion
  3 20 has been burdened by a government entity may assert a violation
  3 21 of new Code section 729.7 as a claim or defense in any judicial
  3 22 or administrative proceeding and may obtain declaratory relief
  3 23 or monetary damages. A person who prevails in any proceeding
  3 24 to enforce the provisions of new Code section 729.7 against a
  3 25 government entity may recover all costs of the action including
  3 26 reasonable attorney fees, except that attorney fees may not be
  3 27 recovered in cases of criminal prosecution.
  3 28    The bill provides that a person found to have abused new
  3 29 Code section 729.7 by filing a frivolous or fraudulent claim
  3 30 may be assessed the government entity's court costs and
  3 31 may be enjoined from filing further claims without leave of
  3 32 court. The bill defines "fraudulent claim" as a claim that is
  3 33 dishonest in fact or that is made principally for a patently
  3 34 improper purpose, such as to harass the opposing party. The
  3 35 bill defines "frivolous claim" as a claim that completely lacks
  4  1 merit under existing law and cannot be supported by a good
  4  2 faith argument for the extension, modification, or reversal of
  4  3 existing law or the establishment of new law.
