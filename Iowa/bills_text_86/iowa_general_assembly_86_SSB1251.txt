not
constitute
agreement
with
20


the
explanation’s
substance
by
the
members
of
the
general

This

relates

the
manufacture,

FIREARM
SUPPRESSORS.
Current
Iowa
law
provides
that
a
24


mechanical
device
specifically
constructed
and
designed
so
that
25


when
attached
to
a
firearm
it
silences,
muffles,
or
suppresses
26


the
sound
when
fired
is
an
offensive
weapon.
Under
Code
27


section
724.3,
any
person
who
knowingly
possesses
an
offensive
28


weapon
commits
a
class
“D”
felony,
punishable
by
confinement
29


for
no
more
than
five
years
and
a
fine
of
at
least
$750
but
not
30


more
than
$7,500.
31


The

strikes
a
provision
in
Code
section
724.1(1)(h)
32


that
classifies
a
firearm
suppressor
as
an

33


By

a
firearm

34


to

The
bill
also
creates
in

Code
section

a
process

whereby
a
person
may
apply
to
the
chief
law
enforcement
officer
3


of
the
jurisdiction
where
the
person
resides
or
maintains
an
4


address
of
record
for
a
certification
to
make
or
transfer
a
5


firearm
suppressor.
The
bill
defines
“firearm
suppressor”
to
6


mean
a
mechanical
device
specifically
constructed
and
designed
7


so
that
when
attached
to
a
firearm
silences,
muffles,
or
8


suppresses
the
sound
when
fired
that
is
considered
a
“firearm
9


silencer”
or
“firearm
muffler”
as
defined
in
18
U.S.C.
§921.
10


The
bill
specifies
that
a
chief
law
enforcement
officer
11


shall
not
refuse
to
provide
certification,
based
on
a
12


generalized
objection,
to
an
applicant
making
or
transferring
13


a
firearm
suppressor.
If
a
person
applies
for
certification
14


to
make
or
transfer
a
firearm
suppressor
with
the
chief
15


law
enforcement
officer,
the
bill
requires
the
chief
law
16


enforcement
officer
to
issue
the
certification
within
30
17


days
of
receiving
such
an
application
unless
the
applicant
18


is
prohibited
by
law
from
making
or
transferring
a
firearm
19


suppressor
or
the
applicant
is
the
subject
of
a
proceeding
that
20


could
result
in
the
applicant
being
prohibited
by
law
from
21


making
or
transferring
a
firearm
suppressor.
If
the
chief
22


law
enforcement
officer
does
not
issue
a
certification
under
23


the
bill,
the
chief
law
enforcement
officer
shall
provide
the
24


applicant
a
written
notification
of
the
denial
and
the
reason
25


for
the
