  4 17                           EXPLANATION
  4 18 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  4 19 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  4 20    This bill concerns government accountability and government
  4 21 employment practices.
  4 22    PERSONNEL RECORDS AND SETTLEMENT AGREEMENTS.  This division
  4 23 of the bill relates to personal information in confidential
  4 24 personnel records of government bodies and personnel settlement
  4 25 agreements.
  4 26    Code section 22.7(11), governing personal information
  4 27 in confidential personnel records of government bodies,
  4 28 is amended.  Previous legislation, effective May 12, 2011,
  4 29 provides that certain information in confidential personnel
  4 30 records is considered a public record.  The bill provides
  4 31 that this information in a confidential personnel record as
  4 32 of or after January 1, 2004, is a public record.  The bill
  4 33 further amends this subsection to provide that information
  4 34 in an official's, officer's, or employee's personnel records
  4 35 concerning the fact that such an individual resigned in
  5  1 lieu of termination or was demoted as the result of a final
  5  2 disciplinary action by a government body and the documented
  5  3 reasons and rationale for any resignation in lieu of
  5  4 termination, discharge, or demotion against an individual
  5  5 are public records and not confidential.  Under current law,
  5  6 only the fact in a personnel record that the individual was
  5  7 discharged is considered a public record and not confidential.
  5  8 The amendments to this subsection take effect upon enactment
  5  9 and apply retroactively to information contained as of or after
  5 10 January 1, 2004, in personnel records.
  5 11    New Code section 22.13A provides that personnel settlement
  5 12 agreements between the state and an employee of the state shall
  5 13 not contain any confidentiality or nondisclosure provisions
  5 14 that attempt to prevent the disclosure of the personnel
  5 15 settlement agreement and shall be made available to the public
  5 16 on an internet site.  In addition, the bill provides that any
  5 17 confidentiality or nondisclosure provision in a personnel
  5 18 settlement agreement is not enforceable. New Code section
  5 19 22.13A is applicable to employees of the executive branch of
  5 20 government and defines a personnel settlement agreement as a
  5 21 binding legal agreement between a state employee and the state
  5 22 employee's employer, subject to Code section 22.13 relating to
  5 23 settlement agreements as public records, to resolve a personnel
  5 24 dispute including but not limited to certain grievances.  The
  5 25 bill provides that the internet site be maintained by the
  5 26 department of administrative services or board of regents,
  5 27 as applicable, based on the employee covered.  The bill also
  5 28 provides that the requirements of this new provision shall not
  5 29 be superseded by any collective bargaining agreement.  These
  5 30 provisions of this division of this bill take effect upon
  5 31 enactment.
  5 32    The division further provides that this division of the bill
  5 33 shall not be construed to limit the ability of law enforcement
  5 34 personnel to investigate any activity that may violate state
  5 35 law.

  4 20    This bill concerns government accountability and government
  4 21 employment practices.
  4 22    PERSONNEL RECORDS AND SETTLEMENT AGREEMENTS.  This division

  4 25 agreements.
  4 26    Code section 22.7(11), governing personal information
  4 27 in confidential personnel records of government bodies,
  4 28 is amended.  Previous legislation, effective May 12, 2011,
  4 29 provides that certain information in confidential personnel
  4 30 records is considered a public record.  The bill provides
  4 31 that this information in a confidential personnel record as
  4 32 of or after January 1, 2004, is a public record.  The bill
  4 33 further amends this subsection to provide that information
  4 34 in an official's, officer's, or employee's personnel records
  4 35 concerning the fact that such an individual resigned in
  5  1 lieu of termination or was demoted as the result of a final
  5  2 disciplinary action by a government body and the documented
  5  3 reasons and rationale for any resignation in lieu of
  5  4 termination, discharge, or demotion against an individual
  5  5 are public records and not confidential.  Under current law,
  5  6 only the fact in a personnel record that the individual was
  5  7 discharged is considered a public record and not confidential.
  5  8 The amendments to this subsection take effect upon enactment
  5  9 and apply retroactively to information contained as of or after
  5 10 January 1, 2004, in personnel records.
  5 11    New Code section 22.13A provides that personnel settlement
  5 12 agreements between the state and an employee of the state shall
  5 13 not contain any confidentiality or nondisclosure provisions
  5 14 that attempt to prevent the disclosure of the personnel
  5 15 settlement agreement and shall be made available to the public
  5 16 on an internet site.  In addition, the bill provides that any
  5 17 confidentiality or nondisclosure provision in a personnel
  5 18 settlement agreement is not enforceable. New Code section
  5 19 22.13A is applicable to employees of the executive branch of
  5 20 government and defines a personnel settlement agreement as a
  5 21 binding legal agreement between a state employee and the state
  5 22 employee's employer, subject to Code section 22.13 relating to
  5 23 settlement agreements as public records, to resolve a personnel
  5 24 dispute including but not limited to certain grievances.  The
  5 25 bill provides that the internet site be maintained by the
  5 26 department of administrative services or board of regents,
  5 27 as applicable, based on the employee covered.  The bill also
  5 28 provides that the requirements of this new provision shall not
  5 29 be superseded by any collective bargaining agreement.  These
  5 30 provisions of this division of this bill take effect upon
  5 31 enactment.
  5 32    The division further provides that this division of the bill
  5 33 shall not be construed to limit the ability of law enforcement
  5 34 personnel to investigate any activity that may violate state
  5 35 law.

  4 17                           EXPLANATION
  4 18 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  4 19 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  4 20    This bill concerns government accountability and government
  4 21 employment practices.
  4 22    PERSONNEL RECORDS AND SETTLEMENT AGREEMENTS.  This division
  4 23 of the bill relates to personal information in confidential
  4 24 personnel records of government bodies and personnel settlement
  4 25 agreements.
  4 26    Code section 22.7(11), governing personal information
  4 27 in confidential personnel records of government bodies,
  4 28 is amended.  Previous legislation, effective May 12, 2011,
  4 29 provides that certain information in confidential personnel
  4 30 records is considered a public record.  The bill provides
  4 31 that this information in a confidential personnel record as
  4 32 of or after January 1, 2004, is a public record.  The bill
  4 33 further amends this subsection to provide that information
  4 34 in an official's, officer's, or employee's personnel records
  4 35 concerning the fact that such an individual resigned in
  5  1 lieu of termination or was demoted as the result of a final
  5  2 disciplinary action by a government body and the documented
  5  3 reasons and rationale for any resignation in lieu of
  5  4 termination, discharge, or demotion against an individual
  5  5 are public records and not confidential.  Under current law,
  5  6 only the fact in a personnel record that the individual was
  5  7 discharged is considered a public record and not confidential.
  5  8 The amendments to this subsection take effect upon enactment
  5  9 and apply retroactively to information contained as of or after
  5 10 January 1, 2004, in personnel records.
  5 11    New Code section 22.13A provides that personnel settlement
  5 12 agreements between the state and an employee of the state shall
  5 13 not contain any confidentiality or nondisclosure provisions
  5 14 that attempt to prevent the disclosure of the personnel
  5 15 settlement agreement and shall be made available to the public
  5 16 on an internet site.  In addition, the bill provides that any
  5 17 confidentiality or nondisclosure provision in a personnel
  5 18 settlement agreement is not enforceable. New Code section
  5 19 22.13A is applicable to employees of the executive branch of
  5 20 government and defines a personnel settlement agreement as a
  5 21 binding legal agreement between a state employee and the state
  5 22 employee's employer, subject to Code section 22.13 relating to
  5 23 settlement agreements as public records, to resolve a personnel
  5 24 dispute including but not limited to certain grievances.  The
  5 25 bill provides that the internet site be maintained by the
  5 26 department of administrative services or board of regents,
  5 27 as applicable, based on the employee covered.  The bill also
  5 28 provides that the requirements of this new provision shall not
  5 29 be superseded by any collective bargaining agreement.  These
  5 30 provisions of this division of this bill take effect upon
  5 31 enactment.
  5 32    The division further provides that this division of the bill
  5 33 shall not be construed to limit the ability of law enforcement
  5 34 personnel to investigate any activity that may violate state
  5 35 law.

  5 11    New Code section 22.13A provides that personnel settlement
  5 12 agreements between the state and an employee of the state shall
  5 13 not contain any confidentiality or nondisclosure provisions
  5 14 that attempt to prevent the disclosure of the personnel

  5 22 employee's employer, subject to Code section 22.13 relating to

  4 30 records is considered a public record.  The bill provides
  4 31 that this information in a confidential personnel record as

  5  2 disciplinary action by a government body and the documented
  5  3 reasons and rationale for any resignation in lieu of
  5  4 termination, discharge, or demotion against an individual
  5  5 are public records and not confidential.  Under current law,
  5  6 only the fact in a personnel record that the individual was

  5 16 on an internet site.  In addition, the bill provides that any

  5 19 22.13A is applicable to employees of the executive branch of
  5 20 government and defines a personnel settlement agreement as a
  5 21 binding legal agreement between a state employee and the state
  5 22 employee's employer, subject to Code section 22.13 relating to

  4 20    This bill concerns government accountability and government
  4 21 employment practices.
  4 22    PERSONNEL RECORDS AND SETTLEMENT AGREEMENTS.  This division

  4 25 agreements.
  4 26    Code section 22.7(11), governing personal information

  4 28 is amended.  Previous legislation, effective May 12, 2011,
  4 29 provides that certain information in confidential personnel
  4 30 records is considered a public record.  The bill provides
  4 31 that this information in a confidential personnel record as

  4 33 further amends this subsection to provide that information
  4 34 in an official's, officer's, or employee's personnel records
  4 35 concerning the fact that such an individual resigned in
  5  1 lieu of termination or was demoted as the result of a final
  5  2 disciplinary action by a government body and the documented
  5  3 reasons and rationale for any resignation in lieu of
  5  4 termination, discharge, or demotion against an individual
  5  5 are public records and not confidential.  Under current law,
  5  6 only the fact in a personnel record that the individual was
  5  7 discharged is considered a public record and not confidential.

  5 15 settlement agreement and shall be made available to the public
  5 16 on an internet site.  In addition, the bill provides that any
  5 17 confidentiality or nondisclosure provision in a personnel
  5 18 settlement agreement is not enforceable. New Code section
  5 19 22.13A is applicable to employees of the executive branch of
  5 20 government and defines a personnel settlement agreement as a
  5 21 binding legal agreement between a state employee and the state
  5 22 employee's employer, subject to Code section 22.13 relating to
  5 23 settlement agreements as public records, to resolve a personnel
  5 24 dispute including but not limited to certain grievances.  The
  5 25 bill provides that the internet site be maintained by the
  5 26 department of administrative services or board of regents,
  5 27 as applicable, based on the employee covered.  The bill also
  5 28 provides that the requirements of this new provision shall not

  5 33 shall not be construed to limit the ability of law enforcement
