  5  2 investigation is not eligible to receive such care and
  5  3 treatment. The bill defines "bordering state" to mean
  5  4 Illinois, Minnesota, Missouri, Nebraska, South Dakota, or
  5  5 Wisconsin, and "region" to mean a mental health and disability
  5  6 services region formed in accordance with Code section 331.389

  5 23 receiving state is  considered to be in the legal custody of
  5 24 the authority responsible for the person under the involuntary

  5 28 subject to all laws and regulations applicable to persons
  5 29 detained, committed, or placed pursuant to the corresponding
  5 30 involuntary civil commitment laws of the receiving state.
  5 31    If a person receiving care and treatment pursuant to an
  5 32 involuntary commitment contract under the bill escapes from
  5 33 the receiving agency and the person at the time of the escape
  5 34 is subject to involuntary confinement under the laws of the
  5 35 sending state, the receiving agency shall use all reasonable
  6  1 means to recapture the escapee. The receiving agency shall
  6  2 immediately report the escape to the sending agency. The

  6  4 authority to direct, the pursuit, retaking, and prosecution of
  6  5 escaped persons within its borders and is liable for the cost
  6  6 of such action to the extent that it would be liable for costs
  6  7 if its own resident escaped.
  6  8    MISCELLANEOUS.  The bill specifies minimum requirements
  6  9 for contracts entered into under the bill. The bill applies
  6 10 to detoxification services unrelated to substance abuse or
  6 11 mental health care and treatment regardless of whether provided
  6 12 on a voluntary or involuntary basis and to substance abuse
  6 13 and mental health care and treatment contracts that include
  6 14 emergency care and treatment.

  4 23    This bill relates to interstate contracts for substance
  4 24 abuse and mental health care and treatment.
  4 25    CONTRACTS FOR INVOLUNTARY COMMITMENTS.  The bill provides

  5 18 Court orders valid under the law of the sending state are
  5 19 granted recognition and reciprocity in the receiving state for
  5 20 a person covered by an involuntary commitment contract under
  5 21 the bill. A person who is detained, committed, or placed
  5 22 under the laws of a sending state and who is transferred to a
  5 23 receiving state is  considered to be in the legal custody of
  5 24 the authority responsible for the person under the involuntary
  5 25 civil commitment laws of the sending state.
  5 26    While in the receiving state pursuant to an involuntary
  5 27 commitment contract executed under the bill, a person is

  5 31    If a person receiving care and treatment pursuant to an
  5 32 involuntary commitment contract under the bill escapes from
  5 33 the receiving agency and the person at the time of the escape
  5 34 is subject to involuntary confinement under the laws of the
  5 35 sending state, the receiving agency shall use all reasonable

  6  6 of such action to the extent that it would be liable for costs
  6  7 if its own resident escaped.

  5 18 Court orders valid under the law of the sending state are
  5 19 granted recognition and reciprocity in the receiving state for

  6  6 of such action to the extent that it would be liable for costs
  6  7 if its own resident escaped.

  4 21 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  4 22 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  4 23    This bill relates to interstate contracts for substance
  4 24 abuse and mental health care and treatment.
  4 25    CONTRACTS FOR INVOLUNTARY COMMITMENTS.  The bill provides
  4 26 that a region as defined in the bill may contract with a public
  4 27 or private agency in a bordering state to secure substance
  4 28 abuse or mental health care and treatment for persons who may
  4 29 receive substance abuse or mental health care and treatment

  4 32 private agency in a bordering state to provide such care and
  4 33 treatment for residents of the bordering state in approved
  4 34 substance abuse or mental health treatment facilities in

  5  1 probation or parole, or who is the subject of a presentence
  5  2 investigation is not eligible to receive such care and
  5  3 treatment. The bill defines "bordering state" to mean
  5  4 Illinois, Minnesota, Missouri, Nebraska, South Dakota, or
  5  5 Wisconsin, and "region" to mean a mental health and disability
  5  6 services region formed in accordance with Code section 331.389

  5 13 contract executed under the bill and a person who is detained,
  5 14 committed, or placed on an involuntary basis under the civil
  5 15 commitment laws of a bordering state substantially similar to
  5 16 Code section 125.75 or 229.6 may be confined and treated in
  5 17 this state pursuant to a contract executed under the bill.
  5 18 Court orders valid under the law of the sending state are
  5 19 granted recognition and reciprocity in the receiving state for
  5 20 a person covered by an involuntary commitment contract under
  5 21 the bill. A person who is detained, committed, or placed
  5 22 under the laws of a sending state and who is transferred to a
  5 23 receiving state is  considered to be in the legal custody of
  5 24 the authority responsible for the person under the involuntary
  5 25 civil commitment laws of the sending state.
  5 26    While in the receiving state pursuant to an involuntary
  5 27 commitment contract executed under the bill, a person is
  5 28 subject to all laws and regulations applicable to persons
  5 29 detained, committed, or placed pursuant to the corresponding
  5 30 involuntary civil commitment laws of the receiving state.
  5 31    If a person receiving care and treatment pursuant to an
  5 32 involuntary commitment contract under the bill escapes from
  5 33 the receiving agency and the person at the time of the escape
  5 34 is subject to involuntary confinement under the laws of the
  5 35 sending state, the receiving agency shall use all reasonable
  6  1 means to recapture the escapee. The receiving agency shall
  6  2 immediately report the escape to the sending agency. The
  6  3 receiving state has the primary responsibility for, and the
  6  4 authority to direct, the pursuit, retaking, and prosecution of
  6  5 escaped persons within its borders and is liable for the cost
  6  6 of such action to the extent that it would be liable for costs
  6  7 if its own resident escaped.

  6  6 of such action to the extent that it would be liable for costs
  6  7 if its own resident escaped.

  5 18 Court orders valid under the law of the sending state are
  5 19 granted recognition and reciprocity in the receiving state for

  6  6 of such action to the extent that it would be liable for costs
  6  7 if its own resident escaped.

  5 18 Court orders valid under the law of the sending state are
  5 19 granted recognition and reciprocity in the receiving state for
