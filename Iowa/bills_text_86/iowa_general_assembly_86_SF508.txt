 10 16                           EXPLANATION
 10 17 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
 10 18 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
 10 19    This bill provides for the legal sale and use of novelties
 10 20 and consumer fireworks within the state.
 10 21    The bill provides that the state fire marshal has the duty to
 10 22 enforce all laws, and rules of the department of public safety
 10 23 concerned with the storage, transportation, handling, and use
 10 24 of fireworks.
 10 25    Current law provides that a person, firm, partnership, or
 10 26 corporation who offers for sale, exposes for sale, sells at
 10 27 retail, or uses or explodes any fireworks, commits a simple
 10 28 misdemeanor.  Current law, however, also provides that a county
 10 29 board of supervisors or the department of natural resources may
 10 30 grant a permit for the display of fireworks if the fireworks
 10 31 display will be handled by a competent operator.  Current
 10 32 law further provides that the term "fireworks" includes any
 10 33 explosive composition, or combination of explosive substances,
 10 34 or article prepared for the purpose of producing a visible
 10 35 or audible effect by combustion, explosion, deflagration,
 11  1 or detonation, including blank cartridges, firecrackers,
 11  2 torpedoes, skyrockets, roman candles, or other fireworks of
 11  3 like construction and fireworks containing any explosive or
 11  4 flammable compound, or other device containing any explosive
 11  5 substance with limited exceptions.
 11  6    The bill maintains these restrictions for display fireworks
 11  7 and provides that the term "display fireworks" shall not
 11  8 include novelties or consumer fireworks. The bill provides
 11  9 definitions for the terms "novelties" and "consumer fireworks".
 11 10    The bill requires that the state fire marshal establish
 11 11 a consumer fireworks seller license, and requires possession
 11 12 of such a license to legally sell consumer fireworks in this
 11 13 state. The state fire marshal is required to establish a fee
 11 14 schedule for consumer fireworks seller licenses. The bill
 11 15 establishes two classes of consumer fireworks and requires
 11 16 an $800 annual licensing fee for a retailer who devotes 50
 11 17 percent or more of the retailer's retail floor space to the
 11 18 sale or display of first=class consumer fireworks. Retailers
 11 19 who devote less than 50 percent of the retailer's retail
 11 20 floor space to the sale or display of first=class consumer
 11 21 fireworks are required to pay an annual licensing fee of $400.
 11 22 A community group that sells first=class consumer fireworks
 11 23 is required to pay an annual licensing fee of $400. The
 11 24 bill requires an annual licensing fee of $100 for retailers
 11 25 or community groups that sell only second=class consumer
 11 26 fireworks.
 11 27    The bill requires that the state fire marshal adopt rules
 11 28 to require that licensed retailers and community groups only
 11 29 offer consumer fireworks for sale in accordance with specified
 11 30 industry standards. The bill also requires that retailers and
 11 31 community groups provide proof of and maintain public liability
 11 32 and public liability insurance. Under the bill, the state fire
 11 33 marshal is required to adopt rules to permit licensed retailers
 11 34 and community groups to sell consumer fireworks at conforming
 11 35 permanent buildings on a year=round basis and at conforming
 12  1 temporary structures from June 13 to July 11 each year.
 12  2    The bill also provides for the revocation of a consumer
 12  3 fireworks seller license for the intentional violation of
 12  4 licensing requirements. The bill establishes procedures
 12  5 for the revocation of such licenses and procedures for
 12  6 review for such revocations. The bill also establishes a
 12  7 consumer fireworks seller license fee fund under the control
 12  8 of the state fire marshal. The fund shall consist of the
 12  9 fees collected for the licensing of retailers and community
 12 10 groups. The fund is required to be used for administration
 12 11 and enforcement of the state fire marshal's consumer fireworks
 12 12 related duties and to provide grants to local fire protection
 12 13 and emergency medical service providers.
 12 14    The bill requires that the state fire marshal adopt rules to
 12 15 require that wholesalers of consumer fireworks register with
 12 16 the state fire marshal and allows the state fire marshal to
 12 17 adopt rules related to wholesaler insurance and the storage
 12 18 and transfer of consumer fireworks by wholesalers. The state
 12 19 fire marshal is also required to establish a $1,000 wholesaler
 12 20 registration fee.
 12 21    Under the bill, a violation of a licensing or registration
 12 22 provision established in Code or by rule is considered a simple
 12 23 misdemeanor. A simple misdemeanor is punishable by confinement
 12 24 for no more than 30 days or a fine of at least $65 but not more
 12 25 than $625, or by both.
 12 26    The bill provides that a person or a firm, partnership, or
 12 27 corporation may possess consumer fireworks as provided in the
 12 28 bill.  The bill provides that a person, firm, partnership, or
 12 29 corporation who sells any consumer firework to a person who
 12 30 is less than 18 years of age commits a simple misdemeanor.
 12 31 A person who is less than 18 years of age who purchases any
 12 32 consumer fireworks commits a simple misdemeanor.  A simple
 12 33 misdemeanor is generally punishable by confinement for no more
 12 34 than 30 days or a fine of at least $65 but not more than $625 or
 12 35 by both, but the bill provides for a fine of at least $250.
 13  1 The bill provides that the state fire marshal may order the
 13  2 suspension of the use of consumer fireworks, display fireworks,
 13  3 or novelties if the fire marshal determines that the use of
 13  4 such devices would constitute a threat to public safety.  The
 13  5 bill also provides that a county board of supervisors may adopt
 13  6 a resolution to suspend the use of display fireworks. The bill
 13  7 provides that a person who violates such an order by the state
 13  8 fire marshal or resolution of a county board of supervisors
 13  9 commits a simple misdemeanor, punishable by a fine of at least
 13 10 $250.
 13 11    The bill also provides certain restrictions on the use
 13 12 or explosion of consumer fireworks. The bill prohibits the
 13 13 use or explosion of consumer fireworks at a time other than
 13 14 between the hours of 9:00 a.m. and 10:00 p.m., except on
 13 15 Memorial Day, the 4th of July, Labor Day, and New Year's Eve,
 13 16 and weekend days near such holidays. On specified days, the
 13 17 use or explosion of consumer fireworks is prohibited except
 13 18 between the hours of 9:00 a.m. and 12:30 a.m. on the following
 13 19 day. The bill further prohibits the use of fireworks by a
 13 20 person on the real property of another person unless the owner
 13 21 of the real property has consented to such use. Under the
 13 22 bill, a violation of these restrictions is considered a simple
 13 23 misdemeanor punishable by a fine of not less than $50 and not
 13 24 more than $500.
 13 25    The bill takes effect June 1, 2015.
