  5 15 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  5 16 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  5 17    This bill abolishes dower and curtesy, modifies the elective
  5 18 share of a surviving spouse, and eliminates the surviving
  5 19 spouse's statutory share of the homestead.
  5 20    Dower and curtesy are common law rights relating to a
  5 21 surviving spouse's property rights in the property of the
  5 22 deceased spouse. The bill explicitly abolishes dower and
  5 23 curtesy in this state.
  5 24    Current law provides that even if a married person's spouse
  5 25 is not a titleholder of the homestead, the married person
  5 26 cannot convey or encumber the homestead unless the married
  5 27 person's spouse executes an instrument conveying or encumbering
  5 28 the same interest in the homestead. The bill provides that
  5 29 if a married person's spouse is not a titleholder of the
  5 30 homestead, the married person may convey or encumber the
  5 31 homestead without the married person's nontitleholder spouse
  5 32 executing an instrument conveying or encumbering the same
  5 33 interest in the homestead.
  5 34    Code section 561.15 provides that neither spouse can remove
  5 35 the other nor the children from the homestead without the
  6  1 consent of the other. The bill repeals Code section 561.15.
  6  2    Current law allows a surviving spouse to elect, in lieu
  6  3 of any property the spouse would otherwise receive under the
  6  4 last will and testament of the deceased spouse, one=third in
  6  5 value of all the legal or equitable estates in real property
  6  6 possessed by the decedent at any time during the marriage which
  6  7 have not been sold on execution or other judicial sale, as well
  6  8 as personal property exempt from execution, one=third of all
  6  9 personal property not necessary for the payment of debts and
  6 10 charges, and one=third in value of the property held in trust
  6 11 not necessary for the payment of debts and charges. The bill
  6 12 provides that real estate possessed by the deceased spouse
  6 13 during the marriage is not subject to the elective share.
  6 14 The bill further provides that the one=third in value of the
  6 15 property held in trust only applies to personal property, not
  6 16 real property.
  6 17    Current Code sections 561.12 and 633.240 provide that a
  6 18 surviving spouse may, in lieu of electing a share of the real
  6 19 property possessed by the decedent at any time of the marriage,
