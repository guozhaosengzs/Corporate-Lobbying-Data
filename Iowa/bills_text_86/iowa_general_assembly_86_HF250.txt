  2  8 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  2  9 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  2 10    Current Code section 257.31(17) authorizes the school budget
  2 11 review committee to grant transportation assistance aid to
  2 12 a school district if the district's average transportation
  2 13 costs per pupil exceed the state average transportation costs
  2 14 per pupil by 150 percent and if the district meets certain
  2 15 data reporting requirements.  Currently, the funding for such
  2 16 transportation assistance aid comes from a transfer of fees
  2 17 collected from the issuance of certain education license plates
  2 18 under Code section 321.32(34) and is considered miscellaneous
  2 19 income and is not included in district cost.
  2 20    Under this bill, if a school district's average

  2 24 is required to grant transportation assistance aid to the
  2 25 district. For fiscal years beginning on or after July 1,
  2 26 2015, the amount of transportation assistance aid for each
  2 27 district eligible under the bill is equal to the district's
  2 28 actual enrollment used to calculate the district's average
  2 29 transportation costs, multiplied by the remainder of the
  2 30 district's average transportation costs per pupil minus the
  2 31 state average transportation costs per pupil.
  2 32    For each fiscal year beginning on or after July 1, 2015,

  3  1 of education license plate fees, to provide transportation
  3  2 assistance aid in the amount determined under the bill.  The

  3  5 committee for the purposes of transportation assistance aid.
