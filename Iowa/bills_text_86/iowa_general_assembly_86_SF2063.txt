  3 23 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  3 24 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  3 25    This bill creates the criminal offense of sexual
  3 26 exploitation by an attorney and includes provisions relating
  3 27 to civil actions for sexual abuse or sexual exploitation by an
  3 28 attorney.
  3 29    The bill amends Code section 614.1 by allowing a civil action
  3 30 for damages to be brought by a client for injuries suffered as
  3 31 a result of sexual abuse or sexual exploitation of that client
  3 32 or a representative of the client by an attorney. The bill
  3 33 provides that the action must be brought within five years of
  3 34 the termination of legal services provided to the client.
  3 35    The bill defines "attorney" to mean a person licensed
  4  1 to practice law in this state or another state and defines
  4  2 "client" to mean a person or a representative of the person who
  4  3 is receiving legal services from the attorney.
  4  4    The bill creates the new criminal offense of sexual
  4  5 exploitation by an attorney in new Code section 709.15A.  Under
  4  6 the bill, sexual exploitation by an attorney occurs when an
  4  7 attorney engages in or participates in a pattern or practice or
  4  8 scheme of conduct to engage in any sexual conduct with a client
  4  9 for the purpose of arousing or satisfying the sexual desires
  4 10 of the attorney or client, while the client is obtaining
  4 11 legal services from the attorney, including but not limited
  4 12 to kissing, touching of the clothed or unclothed inner thigh,
  4 13 breast, groin, buttock, anus, pubes, or genitals, or a sex act
  4 14 as defined in Code section 702.17.
  4 15    Sexual exploitation by an attorney does not occur under the
  4 16 bill if the client is the spouse of the attorney or the sexual
  4 17 relationship between the attorney and client predates the
  4 18 providing of legal services by the attorney.
  4 19    Code section 803.1 governs the type of violations of the bill
  4 20 that may be prosecuted in this state. Iowa court rule 32.1.8
  4 21 governs attorney conflicts of interest with current clients and
  4 22 may be the basis for attorney discipline.
  4 23    An attorney who violates the bill commits a class "D"
  4 24 felony. A class "D" felony is punishable by confinement for no
  4 25 more than five years and a fine of at least $750 but not more
  4 26 than $7,500. A person convicted of sexual exploitation by an
  4 27 attorney is also subject to a 10=year special sentence under
  4 28 Code section 903B.2.
  4 29    An attorney who commits sexual exploitation by an attorney
  4 30 must register as a sex offender. If the victim is under 13
  4 31 years of age, the attorney shall be considered a tier III sex
  4 32 offender, and if the victim is 13 years of age or older, the
  4 33 attorney shall be considered a tier II offender. A tier III
  4 34 offender must verify information to the county sheriff on a
  4 35 more frequent basis than a tier II offender.
  5  1 If the release of a defendant from incarceration is
  5  2 imminent, the bill amends Code section 709.19 by requiring
  5  3 the court to enter a temporary no=contact order requiring
  5  4 the defendant to have no contact with a victim of sexual
  5  5 exploitation by an attorney, if the victim files an affidavit
  5  6 stating the defendant poses a threat to the safety of the
  5  7 victim. Code section 709.19(2) governs the length of the
  5  8 temporary no=contact order.
  5  9    The bill amends Code section 802.2A by allowing an
  5 10 information or indictment for sexual exploitation by an
  5 11 attorney committed on or with a person under 18 years of age to
  5 12 be found within 10 years after the person upon whom the offense
  5 13 is committed attains 18 years of age. The amendment to Code
  5 14 section 802.2A also provides that for other sexual exploitation
  5 15 by attorney offenses, an information or indictment shall be
  5 16 found within 10 years of the date legal services provided in
