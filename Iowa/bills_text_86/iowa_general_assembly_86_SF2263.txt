  7 14 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  7 15 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  7 16    This bill relates to clerks of court, permits the collection
  7 17 of court debt by the clerk of the court of appeals and the clerk
  7 18 of the supreme court, reduces the number of medical reports
  7 19 required to be filed with a clerk of court after an involuntary
  7 20 commitment in connection with a substance=related disorder or
  7 21 a serious mental impairment, and transfers the responsibility
  7 22 to file a notice of lis pendens from the clerk of court to the
  7 23 claimant.
  7 24    DIVISION I == COLLECTION OF COURT DEBT.  Under current law,
  7 25 court debt is payable to the clerk of the district court.

  7 35 substance abuse evaluation or psychiatric evaluation with the
  8  1 clerk of court. This division provides that only one copy of
  8  2 the substance abuse evaluation or psychiatric evaluation needs

  8  4 upon enactment.
  8  5    DIVISION III == RECORDING OF LIS PENDENS.  Lis pendens
  8  6 is a public notice of a lawsuit affecting real estate. The
  8  7 effect of lis pendens is that if a person purchases real
  8  8 estate subject to a pending lawsuit after the filing of lis
  8  9 pendens, the purchaser takes the real estate subject to all
  8 10 the plaintiff's claims in the property that are established
  8 11 in the lawsuit. This division provides that a lawsuit is

  8 17 citation affecting real estate is filed, the clerk of the
  8 18 district court indexes the petition or municipal infraction
  8 19 citation in an index book under the tract number which
  8 20 describes the property.
  8 21    The division provides that the clerk of district court is
  8 22 not required to index the petition or municipal infraction

  9  2 pendens with a county recorder to also electronically file a
  9  3 copy of the notice with the clerk of the district court where
  9  4 the action is filed. The $50 filing fee currently collected
  9  5 by the clerk of the district court is abolished. The party who
  9  6 files the notice of lis pendens is required to pay the county
  9  7 recorder filing fees specified in Code section 331.604.
  9  8    The division provides that if the action is dismissed,
  9  9 the notice of lis pendens is canceled as of the date of the
  9 10 dismissal.

  9  3 copy of the notice with the clerk of the district court where
  9  4 the action is filed. The $50 filing fee currently collected
  9  5 by the clerk of the district court is abolished. The party who
  9  6 files the notice of lis pendens is required to pay the county
  9  7 recorder filing fees specified in Code section 331.604.

  8  5    DIVISION III == RECORDING OF LIS PENDENS.  Lis pendens

  8  8 estate subject to a pending lawsuit after the filing of lis
  8  9 pendens, the purchaser takes the real estate subject to all
  8 10 the plaintiff's claims in the property that are established
  8 11 in the lawsuit. This division provides that a lawsuit is
  8 12 pending until the court enters a final order, including appeal
  8 13 and remand, or the court enters disposition, if any, of the
  8 14 property described in the notice of lis pendens, whichever is
  8 15 later.
  8 16    Under current law, when a petition or municipal infraction
  8 17 citation affecting real estate is filed, the clerk of the
  8 18 district court indexes the petition or municipal infraction
  8 19 citation in an index book under the tract number which
  8 20 describes the property.
  8 21    The division provides that the clerk of district court is
  8 22 not required to index the petition or municipal infraction
  8 23 citation.  Instead, when a petition or municipal infraction
  8 24 citation affecting real estate is filed, any party to the
  8 25 pending action may file a notice of lis pendens with the county
  8 26 recorder of each county in which any part of the real estate
  8 27 lies. The notice of lis pendens must contain the names of
  8 28 the parties, the object of the action, a description of the
  8 29 property involved or to be affected, the county where the
  8 30 action is filed, and the associated case number. The division
  8 31 requires that county recorder to endorse on each notice of lis
  8 32 pendens the day, hour, and minute when filed for recording and
  8 33 the document reference number. The recorder must also index
  8 34 the notice and record the lis pendens in the manner provided
  8 35 for recording real estate mortgages.
  9  1 The division requires the party who files a notice of lis
  9  2 pendens with a county recorder to also electronically file a
  9  3 copy of the notice with the clerk of the district court where
  9  4 the action is filed. The $50 filing fee currently collected
  9  5 by the clerk of the district court is abolished. The party who
  9  6 files the notice of lis pendens is required to pay the county
  9  7 recorder filing fees specified in Code section 331.604.
  9  8    The division provides that if the action is dismissed,
  9  9 the notice of lis pendens is canceled as of the date of the
  9 10 dismissal.
  9 11    The division applies to petitions or municipal infraction
  9 12 citations affecting real estate filed on or after January 1,
  9 13 2017.
  9 14    The division makes conforming changes.
  9 15    DIVISION IV == OUT=OF=STATE=WITNESS FEES.  Under current
  9 16 law, a judge can order a person from another state to appear
  9 17 as a witness in this state, and such person is entitled to
  9 18 reimbursement of 10 cents per mile for each mile traveled
  9 19 to and from the proceedings the person is required to
  9 20 attend. This division amends current law to provide that an
  9 21 out=of=state witness shall be reimbursed in the same manner as
  9 22 mileage expenses are reimbursed under Code section 602.1509,
  9 23 which directs a person to be paid actual and necessary
  9 24 expenses, not to exceed a maximum amount established by the
