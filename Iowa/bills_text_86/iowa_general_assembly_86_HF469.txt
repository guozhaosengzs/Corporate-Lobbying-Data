  3 15 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  3 16 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  3 17    This bill creates a licensed social worker loan repayment
  3 18 program administered by the college student aid commission.
  3 19 Applicants for the program must enter into an agreement with
  3 20 the commission, agreeing to work for a specific period of time
  3 21 in a "critical human service area", defined as a geographic
  3 22 area in Iowa with a shortage of social workers in health,
  3 23 mental health, substance abuse, aging, HIV/AIDS, victim, or
  3 24 child welfare concerns, or communities with multilingual needs.
  3 25    The program provides a specific annual benefit, up to
  3 26 $6,500, for licensed social workers who have worked in a
  3 27 critical human service area in the previous year. No recipient
  3 28 shall receive loan repayment that exceeds the total remaining
  3 29 balance of the student loan debt and no recipient shall receive
  3 30 cumulative awards in excess of $25,000.
  3 31    The program is funded by a special revolving fund in
  3 32 the state treasury, controlled by the college student aid
  3 33 commission. The fund consists of moneys appropriated for
  3 34 purposes of the program, repayments by participants who fail
  3 35 to meet the service area requirements, and any other available
  4  1 moneys. Moneys deposited in the fund do not revert to any
  4  2 other fund at the end of any fiscal year but shall remain in the
  4  3 fund and be continuously available for the program. Interest
  4  4 or earnings on moneys deposited in the fund shall also be
