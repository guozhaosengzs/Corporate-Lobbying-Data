  4 18    a.  Technology used to support health care=related functions
  4 19 is known as health information technology. Health information
  4 20 technology provides a mechanism to transform the delivery of
  4 21 health and medical care in Iowa and across the nation.
  4 22    b.  Health information technology is rapidly evolving to
  4 23 contribute to the goals of improving the experience of care,
  4 24 improving the health of populations, and reducing per capita
  4 25 costs of health care.
  4 26    c.  A health information network involves the secure
  4 27 electronic sharing of health information across the boundaries
  4 28 of individual practice and institutional health settings and
  4 29 with consumers. The broad use of health information technology
  4 30 and a health information network should improve health care
  4 31 quality and the overall health of the population, increase
  4 32 efficiencies in administrative health care, reduce unnecessary
  4 33 health care costs, and help prevent medical errors.
  4 34    d.  All health information technology efforts shall endeavor
  4 35 to represent the interests and meet the needs of consumers and
  5  1 the health care sector, protect the privacy of individuals
  5  2 and the confidentiality of individuals' information, promote
  5  3 best practices, and make information easily accessible to
  5  4 the members of the patient=centered care coordination team,
  5  5 including but not limited to patients, providers, and payors.
  5  6    2.  It is the intent of the general assembly that the Iowa

  5  8 benefit network or a health insurance network.

 15  3    This bill provides for the administration and governance of

 15 20 legal and policy requirements. These provisions take effect
 15 21 only upon the assumption of the administration and governance

 15 29 to use the record locator service for treatments, payment,

 15  1 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
 15  2 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
 15  3    This bill provides for the administration and governance of
 15  4 an Iowa health information network by a nonprofit designated
 15  5 entity.  The bill creates a new Code chapter, 135D, the Iowa
 15  6 health information network. The new Code chapter includes
 15  7 many of the same provisions existing under Code chapter
 15  8 135, division XXI, which provides for the administration and
 15  9 governance of the Iowa health information network by the
 15 10 department of public health, an electronic health information
 15 11 advisory council, and an executive committee. The bill instead
 15 12 places these functions under a designated entity, which is a
 15 13 nonprofit corporation designated by the department through a
 15 14 competitive process as the entity responsible for administering
 15 15 and governing the network. The bill includes definitions,
 15 16 findings and intent, principles and technical infrastructure
 15 17 requirements, requirements for administration and governance
 15 18 by the designated entity, requirements for the composition and
 15 19 duties of the board of directors of the designated entity, and
 15 20 legal and policy requirements. These provisions take effect
 15 21 only upon the assumption of the administration and governance
 15 22 of the network by the designated entity.
 15 23    The bill makes changes to current Code relating to the
 15 24 definitions of "care coordination", "public health activities",
 15 25 and "record locator service"; the sharing of patient health
 15 26 information available through the record locator service;
 15 27 and the privacy and security requirements applicable to the
 15 28 sharing of patient information by participants authorized
 15 29 to use the record locator service for treatments, payment,
 15 30 health care operations, public health activities, and care
 15 31 coordination. The provisions are effective upon enactment and
 15 32 would continue in effect through the transition period. The
 15 33 bill also provides for the transition of the administration
 15 34 and governance of the Iowa health information network to the
 15 35 designated entity and provides for the repeal of the current
 16  1 provisions related to the Iowa health information network upon
 16  2 the assumption of the designated entity of the administration

 15  1 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
 15  2 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
 15  3    This bill provides for the administration and governance of
 15  4 an Iowa health information network by a nonprofit designated
 15  5 entity.  The bill creates a new Code chapter, 135D, the Iowa
 15  6 health information network. The new Code chapter includes
 15  7 many of the same provisions existing under Code chapter
 15  8 135, division XXI, which provides for the administration and
 15  9 governance of the Iowa health information network by the
 15 10 department of public health, an electronic health information
 15 11 advisory council, and an executive committee. The bill instead
 15 12 places these functions under a designated entity, which is a
 15 13 nonprofit corporation designated by the department through a
 15 14 competitive process as the entity responsible for administering
 15 15 and governing the network. The bill includes definitions,

 15 18 by the designated entity, requirements for the composition and
 15 19 duties of the board of directors of the designated entity, and
 15 20 legal and policy requirements. These provisions take effect
 15 21 only upon the assumption of the administration and governance
 15 22 of the network by the designated entity.
 15 23    The bill makes changes to current Code relating to the
 15 24 definitions of "care coordination", "public health activities",
 15 25 and "record locator service"; the sharing of patient health
 15 26 information available through the record locator service;
 15 27 and the privacy and security requirements applicable to the
 15 28 sharing of patient information by participants authorized
 15 29 to use the record locator service for treatments, payment,
