  2 12 aid per pupil for the budget year.
  2 13    4.  School district enrollment supplement payments shall be
  2 14 paid by the department of education in a single payment at the

  3  5 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  3  6 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  3  7    This bill establishes a school district enrollment
  3  8 supplement program to provide additional funding for school
  3  9 districts in which the district's actual enrollment for the
  3 10 budget year exceeds the budget enrollment for the budget
  3 11 year. For the school budget year beginning July 1, 2017, and
  3 12 succeeding budget years, if a district's actual enrollment
  3 13 for the budget year is greater than its budget enrollment for
  3 14 the budget year, the district may submit a request to the
  3 15 school budget review committee for a school district enrollment
  3 16 supplement. The school budget review committee is required
  3 17 to approve the request for the enrollment supplement if the
  3 18 district meets the requirements of the bill.
  3 19    The amount of each eligible school district's enrollment
  3 20 supplement is the difference between the school district's
  3 21 actual enrollment for the budget year minus the school
  3 22 district's budget enrollment for the budget year multiplied by
  3 23 the school district's regular program foundation aid per pupil
  3 24 for the budget year.
  3 25    The bill establishes a $10 million annual appropriation for
  3 26 each fiscal year beginning on or after July 1, 2017, for the
  3 27 payment of school district enrollment supplement amounts. If
  3 28 the appropriation is insufficient to make all such payments,
  3 29 the department of education is directed to prorate those
  3 30 payment amounts. The bill specifies that school district
  3 31 enrollment supplement payments are miscellaneous income and
  3 32 must be deposited in the school district's general fund.
  3 33 However, the enrollment supplement amount is not to be included
  3 34 in district cost.
  3 35    Code section 257.13 provides that if a school district's
  4  1 actual enrollment for the budget year is greater than its
  4  2 budget enrollment for the budget year, the district shall be
  4  3 eligible to receive an on=time funding budget adjustment. The
  4  4 bill provides that a budget adjustment under Code section
  4  5 257.13 shall be reduced by the amount received by the district
  4  6 under the school district enrollment supplement program.  The
  4  7 bill further specifies that an enrollment supplement does not
  4  8 affect the receipt or amount of a budget adjustment received
  4  9 under Code section 257.14, and, except for an adjustment to
  4 10 the amount, does not affect a school district's eligibility to
  4 11 receive an amount from the school budget review committee under
  4 12 Code section 257.31 based on an increase in enrollment.

  4  9 under Code section 257.14, and, except for an adjustment to
