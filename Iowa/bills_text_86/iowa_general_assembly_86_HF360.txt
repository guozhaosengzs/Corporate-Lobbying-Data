  2 34 upon consent of the proper holder. A certificate issued
  2 35 pursuant to this section cannot pledge the credit of the state

  3  6 following five years or until depleted, whichever is earlier.

  3 25 designated on the original tax credit certificate. A tax

  2 33 tax credit, except as otherwise provided in this section or
  2 34 upon consent of the proper holder. A certificate issued
  2 35 pursuant to this section cannot pledge the credit of the state

  3  5 for the tax year may be credited to the tax liability for the
  3  6 following five years or until depleted, whichever is earlier.

  3 14 along with a statement containing the transferee's name, tax
  3 15 identification number, and address, the denomination that each
  3 16 replacement tax credit certificate is to carry, and any other
  3 17 information required by the department of revenue.
  3 18    i.  Within thirty days of receiving the transferred tax
  3 19 credit certificate and the transferee's statement, the
  3 20 department of revenue shall issue one or more replacement
  3 21 tax credit certificates to the transferee. Each replacement
  3 22 tax credit certificate must contain the information required
  3 23 for the original tax credit certificate. A replacement tax
  3 24 credit certificate may designate a different tax than the tax
  3 25 designated on the original tax credit certificate. A tax
  3 26 credit shall not be claimed by a transferee under this section
  3 27 until a replacement tax credit certificate identifying the
  3 28 transferee as the proper holder has been issued.
  3 29    j.  The transferee may use the amount of the tax credit
  3 30 transferred against the taxes imposed in chapter 422, divisions
  3 31 II, III, and V, and in chapter 432, and against the moneys and
  3 32 credits tax imposed in section 533.329, for any tax year the
  3 33 original transferor could have claimed the tax credit. Any
  3 34 consideration received for the transfer of the tax credit shall
  3 35 not be included as income under chapter 422, divisions II,
  4  1 III, and V.  Any consideration paid for the transfer of the tax
  4  2 credit shall not be deducted from income under chapter 422,
  4  3 divisions II, III, and V.

  2 33 tax credit, except as otherwise provided in this section or
  2 34 upon consent of the proper holder. A certificate issued
  2 35 pursuant to this section cannot pledge the credit of the state
  3  1 and any such certificate so pledged to secure the debt of the
  3  2 original holder or a transferee shall not constitute a contract
  3  3 binding the state.
  3  4    g.  Any tax credit in excess of the taxpayer's liability
  3  5 for the tax year may be credited to the tax liability for the
  3  6 following five years or until depleted, whichever is earlier.

  3  8 the tax year in which the taxpayer claims the tax credit.
  3  9    h.  Tax credit certificates issued pursuant to this section

  3 19 credit certificate and the transferee's statement, the
  3 20 department of revenue shall issue one or more replacement
  3 21 tax credit certificates to the transferee. Each replacement

  3 25 designated on the original tax credit certificate. A tax
  3 26 credit shall not be claimed by a transferee under this section
  3 27 until a replacement tax credit certificate identifying the
  3 28 transferee as the proper holder has been issued.
  3 29    j.  The transferee may use the amount of the tax credit
  3 30 transferred against the taxes imposed in chapter 422, divisions
  3 31 II, III, and V, and in chapter 432, and against the moneys and

  2 32 certificate or that curtails, limits, or withdraws the related
  2 33 tax credit, except as otherwise provided in this section or
  2 34 upon consent of the proper holder. A certificate issued
  2 35 pursuant to this section cannot pledge the credit of the state
  3  1 and any such certificate so pledged to secure the debt of the
  3  2 original holder or a transferee shall not constitute a contract
  3  3 binding the state.
  3  4    g.  Any tax credit in excess of the taxpayer's liability
  3  5 for the tax year may be credited to the tax liability for the
  3  6 following five years or until depleted, whichever is earlier.

  3  8 the tax year in which the taxpayer claims the tax credit.
  3  9    h.  Tax credit certificates issued pursuant to this section
  3 10 may be transferred, in whole or in part, to any person. A tax

  3 13 transferred tax credit certificate to the department of revenue
  3 14 along with a statement containing the transferee's name, tax
  3 15 identification number, and address, the denomination that each
  3 16 replacement tax credit certificate is to carry, and any other
  3 17 information required by the department of revenue.
  3 18    i.  Within thirty days of receiving the transferred tax
  3 19 credit certificate and the transferee's statement, the
  3 20 department of revenue shall issue one or more replacement
  3 21 tax credit certificates to the transferee. Each replacement
  3 22 tax credit certificate must contain the information required
  3 23 for the original tax credit certificate. A replacement tax
  3 24 credit certificate may designate a different tax than the tax
  3 25 designated on the original tax credit certificate. A tax
  3 26 credit shall not be claimed by a transferee under this section
  3 27 until a replacement tax credit certificate identifying the
  3 28 transferee as the proper holder has been issued.
  3 29    j.  The transferee may use the amount of the tax credit
  3 30 transferred against the taxes imposed in chapter 422, divisions
  3 31 II, III, and V, and in chapter 432, and against the moneys and
  3 32 credits tax imposed in section 533.329, for any tax year the
  3 33 original transferor could have claimed the tax credit. Any
  3 34 consideration received for the transfer of the tax credit shall
  3 35 not be included as income under chapter 422, divisions II,
  4  1 III, and V.  Any consideration paid for the transfer of the tax

  2  6 allocating tax credits pursuant to this section, the commission
  2  7 shall allocate one million dollars in the aggregate for
  2  8 purposes of this section, unless the commission determines that
  2  9 the tax credits awarded will be less than that amount.
  2 10    (2)  If in a fiscal year the aggregate amount of tax credits
  2 11 applied for exceeds the amount allocated for that fiscal year
  2 12 under this paragraph "d", the commission shall establish a
  2 13 wait list for certificates. Applications that were approved
  2 14 but for which certificates were not issued shall be placed

  2 17 certificates in succeeding fiscal years.

  2 22 include the contingencies that must be met for a certificate
  2 23 to be redeemable in order to receive a tax credit. The
  2 24 procedures established by the commission, in cooperation with

  2 32 certificate or that curtails, limits, or withdraws the related
  2 33 tax credit, except as otherwise provided in this section or
  2 34 upon consent of the proper holder. A certificate issued
  2 35 pursuant to this section cannot pledge the credit of the state
  3  1 and any such certificate so pledged to secure the debt of the
  3  2 original holder or a transferee shall not constitute a contract
  3  3 binding the state.
  3  4    g.  Any tax credit in excess of the taxpayer's liability
  3  5 for the tax year may be credited to the tax liability for the
  3  6 following five years or until depleted, whichever is earlier.

  3  8 the tax year in which the taxpayer claims the tax credit.
  3  9    h.  Tax credit certificates issued pursuant to this section
  3 10 may be transferred, in whole or in part, to any person. A tax
  3 11 credit certificate shall only be transferred once. Within
  3 12 ninety days of transfer, the transferee shall submit the
  3 13 transferred tax credit certificate to the department of revenue
  3 14 along with a statement containing the transferee's name, tax
  3 15 identification number, and address, the denomination that each
  3 16 replacement tax credit certificate is to carry, and any other
  3 17 information required by the department of revenue.
  3 18    i.  Within thirty days of receiving the transferred tax
  3 19 credit certificate and the transferee's statement, the
  3 20 department of revenue shall issue one or more replacement
  3 21 tax credit certificates to the transferee. Each replacement
  3 22 tax credit certificate must contain the information required
  3 23 for the original tax credit certificate. A replacement tax
  3 24 credit certificate may designate a different tax than the tax
  3 25 designated on the original tax credit certificate. A tax
  3 26 credit shall not be claimed by a transferee under this section
  3 27 until a replacement tax credit certificate identifying the
  3 28 transferee as the proper holder has been issued.
  3 29    j.  The transferee may use the amount of the tax credit
  3 30 transferred against the taxes imposed in chapter 422, divisions
  3 31 II, III, and V, and in chapter 432, and against the moneys and
  3 32 credits tax imposed in section 533.329, for any tax year the
  3 33 original transferor could have claimed the tax credit. Any
  3 34 consideration received for the transfer of the tax credit shall
  3 35 not be included as income under chapter 422, divisions II,
  4  1 III, and V.  Any consideration paid for the transfer of the tax
  4  2 credit shall not be deducted from income under chapter 422,
  4  3 divisions II, III, and V.

  2 33 tax credit, except as otherwise provided in this section or
  2 34 upon consent of the proper holder. A certificate issued
  2 35 pursuant to this section cannot pledge the credit of the state
  3  1 and any such certificate so pledged to secure the debt of the
  3  2 original holder or a transferee shall not constitute a contract
  3  3 binding the state.

  3 17 information required by the department of revenue.
  3 18    i.  Within thirty days of receiving the transferred tax
  3 19 credit certificate and the transferee's statement, the
  3 20 department of revenue shall issue one or more replacement
  3 21 tax credit certificates to the transferee. Each replacement
  3 22 tax credit certificate must contain the information required
  3 23 for the original tax credit certificate. A replacement tax

  3 25 designated on the original tax credit certificate. A tax
  3 26 credit shall not be claimed by a transferee under this section
  3 27 until a replacement tax credit certificate identifying the
  3 28 transferee as the proper holder has been issued.
  3 29    j.  The transferee may use the amount of the tax credit
  3 30 transferred against the taxes imposed in chapter 422, divisions
  3 31 II, III, and V, and in chapter 432, and against the moneys and
  3 32 credits tax imposed in section 533.329, for any tax year the
  3 33 original transferor could have claimed the tax credit. Any
  3 34 consideration received for the transfer of the tax credit shall
  3 35 not be included as income under chapter 422, divisions II,
  4  1 III, and V.  Any consideration paid for the transfer of the tax
  4  2 credit shall not be deducted from income under chapter 422,
  4  3 divisions II, III, and V.

  2  6 allocating tax credits pursuant to this section, the commission
  2  7 shall allocate one million dollars in the aggregate for
  2  8 purposes of this section, unless the commission determines that
  2  9 the tax credits awarded will be less than that amount.

  2 32 certificate or that curtails, limits, or withdraws the related
  2 33 tax credit, except as otherwise provided in this section or
  2 34 upon consent of the proper holder. A certificate issued
  2 35 pursuant to this section cannot pledge the credit of the state
  3  1 and any such certificate so pledged to secure the debt of the
  3  2 original holder or a transferee shall not constitute a contract
  3  3 binding the state.
  3  4    g.  Any tax credit in excess of the taxpayer's liability
  3  5 for the tax year may be credited to the tax liability for the
  3  6 following five years or until depleted, whichever is earlier.

  3  8 the tax year in which the taxpayer claims the tax credit.
  3  9    h.  Tax credit certificates issued pursuant to this section
  3 10 may be transferred, in whole or in part, to any person. A tax
  3 11 credit certificate shall only be transferred once. Within
  3 12 ninety days of transfer, the transferee shall submit the
  3 13 transferred tax credit certificate to the department of revenue
  3 14 along with a statement containing the transferee's name, tax
  3 15 identification number, and address, the denomination that each
  3 16 replacement tax credit certificate is to carry, and any other
  3 17 information required by the department of revenue.
  3 18    i.  Within thirty days of receiving the transferred tax
  3 19 credit certificate and the transferee's statement, the
  3 20 department of revenue shall issue one or more replacement
  3 21 tax credit certificates to the transferee. Each replacement
  3 22 tax credit certificate must contain the information required
  3 23 for the original tax credit certificate. A replacement tax
  3 24 credit certificate may designate a different tax than the tax
  3 25 designated on the original tax credit certificate. A tax
  3 26 credit shall not be claimed by a transferee under this section
  3 27 until a replacement tax credit certificate identifying the
  3 28 transferee as the proper holder has been issued.
  3 29    j.  The transferee may use the amount of the tax credit
  3 30 transferred against the taxes imposed in chapter 422, divisions
  3 31 II, III, and V, and in chapter 432, and against the moneys and
  3 32 credits tax imposed in section 533.329, for any tax year the
  3 33 original transferor could have claimed the tax credit. Any
  3 34 consideration received for the transfer of the tax credit shall
  3 35 not be included as income under chapter 422, divisions II,
  4  1 III, and V.  Any consideration paid for the transfer of the tax
  4  2 credit shall not be deducted from income under chapter 422,
  4  3 divisions II, III, and V.

  2  5 basis, which certificates may be redeemed for tax credits.  In
  2  6 allocating tax credits pursuant to this section, the commission
  2  7 shall allocate one million dollars in the aggregate for
  2  8 purposes of this section, unless the commission determines that
  2  9 the tax credits awarded will be less than that amount.
  2 10    (2)  If in a fiscal year the aggregate amount of tax credits
  2 11 applied for exceeds the amount allocated for that fiscal year
  2 12 under this paragraph "d", the commission shall establish a
  2 13 wait list for certificates. Applications that were approved
  2 14 but for which certificates were not issued shall be placed
  2 15 on the wait list in the order the applications were received
  2 16 by the commission and shall be given priority for receiving
  2 17 certificates in succeeding fiscal years.
  2 18    e.  The commission shall, in cooperation with the
  2 19 department of revenue, establish criteria and procedures
  2 20 for the allocation and issuance of tax credits by means of
  2 21 certificates issued by the commission. The criteria shall
  2 22 include the contingencies that must be met for a certificate
  2 23 to be redeemable in order to receive a tax credit. The
  2 24 procedures established by the commission, in cooperation with
  2 25 the department of revenue, shall relate to the procedures for
  2 26 the issuance and transfer of the certificates and for the
  2 27 redemption of a certificate and related tax credit.
  2 28    f.  A certificate and related tax credit issued pursuant to

  2 32 certificate or that curtails, limits, or withdraws the related
  2 33 tax credit, except as otherwise provided in this section or
  2 34 upon consent of the proper holder. A certificate issued
  2 35 pursuant to this section cannot pledge the credit of the state
  3  1 and any such certificate so pledged to secure the debt of the
  3  2 original holder or a transferee shall not constitute a contract
  3  3 binding the state.
  3  4    g.  Any tax credit in excess of the taxpayer's liability
  3  5 for the tax year may be credited to the tax liability for the
  3  6 following five years or until depleted, whichever is earlier.
  3  7 A tax credit shall not be carried back to a tax year prior to
  3  8 the tax year in which the taxpayer claims the tax credit.
  3  9    h.  Tax credit certificates issued pursuant to this section
  3 10 may be transferred, in whole or in part, to any person. A tax
  3 11 credit certificate shall only be transferred once. Within
  3 12 ninety days of transfer, the transferee shall submit the
  3 13 transferred tax credit certificate to the department of revenue
  3 14 along with a statement containing the transferee's name, tax
  3 15 identification number, and address, the denomination that each
  3 16 replacement tax credit certificate is to carry, and any other
  3 17 information required by the department of revenue.
  3 18    i.  Within thirty days of receiving the transferred tax
  3 19 credit certificate and the transferee's statement, the
  3 20 department of revenue shall issue one or more replacement
  3 21 tax credit certificates to the transferee. Each replacement
  3 22 tax credit certificate must contain the information required
  3 23 for the original tax credit certificate. A replacement tax
  3 24 credit certificate may designate a different tax than the tax
  3 25 designated on the original tax credit certificate. A tax
  3 26 credit shall not be claimed by a transferee under this section
  3 27 until a replacement tax credit certificate identifying the
  3 28 transferee as the proper holder has been issued.
  3 29    j.  The transferee may use the amount of the tax credit
  3 30 transferred against the taxes imposed in chapter 422, divisions
  3 31 II, III, and V, and in chapter 432, and against the moneys and
  3 32 credits tax imposed in section 533.329, for any tax year the
  3 33 original transferor could have claimed the tax credit. Any
  3 34 consideration received for the transfer of the tax credit shall
  3 35 not be included as income under chapter 422, divisions II,
  4  1 III, and V.  Any consideration paid for the transfer of the tax
  4  2 credit shall not be deducted from income under chapter 422,
  4  3 divisions II, III, and V.
  4  4    3.  Promise agreement.  A promise agreement shall be entered

  2 34 upon consent of the proper holder. A certificate issued
  2 35 pursuant to this section cannot pledge the credit of the state

  3 19 credit certificate and the transferee's statement, the
  3 20 department of revenue shall issue one or more replacement
  3 21 tax credit certificates to the transferee. Each replacement
  3 22 tax credit certificate must contain the information required

  3 25 designated on the original tax credit certificate. A tax
  3 26 credit shall not be claimed by a transferee under this section
  3 27 until a replacement tax credit certificate identifying the
  3 28 transferee as the proper holder has been issued.

  3  8 the tax year in which the taxpayer claims the tax credit.

  3  5 for the tax year may be credited to the tax liability for the
  3  6 following five years or until depleted, whichever is earlier.

  7 25                           EXPLANATION
  7 26 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  7 27 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  7 28    This bill establishes a medical student promise tax credit
  7 29 and a medical student promise fund under the control of the
  7 30 college student aid commission for the purpose of providing
  7 31 a means for reducing the interest rate charged to a medical
  7 32 student for an educational loan to an amount of interest that
  7 33 is not more than one=half of the interest rate currently
  7 34 charged for federal educational loans.
  7 35    TAX CREDIT.  The tax credit is allowed against the personal
  8  1 and corporate income tax, franchise tax, insurance premium tax,
  8  2 and the moneys and credits tax.
  8  3    To receive a certificate which may be redeemed for a tax
  8  4 credit, the taxpayer must submit an application to the college
  8  5 student aid commission. The commission must issue certificates
  8  6 on a first=come, first=served basis. In allocating tax
  8  7 credits, the commission shall allocate $1 million in the
  8  8 aggregate for certificates for tax credits, unless the
  8  9 commission determines that the tax credits awarded will be
  8 10 less than that amount.  If the amount of applications exceeds
  8 11 the available tax credits in a fiscal year, the commission is
  8 12 required to establish a wait list and give priority in later
  8 13 years to applications on the wait list.
  8 14    The taxpayer may transfer a tax credit once, and the bill
  8 15 establishes procedures for transferring the credit to another
  8 16 person.  Within 90 days of transfer, the transferee must submit
  8 17 the transferred tax credit certificate to the department of
  8 18 revenue along with a statement containing information specified
  8 19 in the bill. Within 30 days of receiving the transferred
  8 20 tax credit certificate and the transferee's statement, the
  8 21 department of revenue must issue one or more replacement tax
  8 22 credit certificates to the transferee. A replacement tax
  8 23 credit certificate may designate a different tax than the
  8 24 tax designated on the original tax credit certificate. Any
  8 25 consideration received for the transfer of the tax credit shall
  8 26 not be included as income.  Any consideration paid for the
  8 27 transfer of the tax credit shall not be deducted from income.
  8 28    The commission must, in cooperation with the department of
  8 29 revenue, establish criteria and procedures for the allocation
  8 30 and issuance of tax credits by means of certificates issued by
  8 31 the commission. The criteria shall include the contingencies
  8 32 that must be met for a certificate to be redeemable in order to
  8 33 receive a tax credit.
  8 34    Any tax credit in excess of the taxpayer's liability for the
  8 35 tax year may be credited to the tax liability for the following
  9  1 five years or until depleted, whichever is earlier. A tax
  9  2 credit shall not be carried back to a tax year prior to the tax
  9  3 year in which the taxpayer claims the tax credit.
  9  4    PROMISE AGREEMENT.  To be eligible for the reduction in
  9  5 the interest rate charged for an educational loan, a medical
  9  6 student must enter into a promise agreement with the commission
  9  7 and be enrolled full=time in an eligible university in a
  9  8 curriculum leading to an eligible degree.  "Eligible degree"
  9  9 means a master of physician assistant studies or a doctor of
  9 10 medicine, pharmacy, dental surgery, or osteopathy degree;
  9 11 and "eligible university" means the state university of Iowa
  9 12 college of medicine or Des Moines university == osteopathic
  9 13 medical center.
  9 14    Under the promise agreement, a medical student shall agree
  9 15 to and shall fulfill certain requirements, including completing
  9 16 a residency if applicable, applying for and obtaining a license
  9 17 to practice, residing in Iowa, and engaging in full=time
  9 18 practice in the state as a physician assistant, a dentist, or
  9 19 a doctor of medicine and surgery or osteopathic medicine and
  9 20 surgery, or pharmacist for a period of 60 consecutive months.
  9 21    The bill provides for the postponement and satisfaction
  9 22 of the obligation to practice full time in Iowa.  Practice
  9 23 may be postponed for certain purposes, such as active duty
  9 24 status in the armed forces, the armed forces military reserve,
  9 25 or the national guard; service in volunteers in service to
  9 26 America; service in the federal peace corps; a period of
  9 27 service commitment to the United States public health service
  9 28 commissioned corps; a period of religious missionary work; or
  9 29 any period of temporary medical incapacity during which the
  9 30 person obligated is unable to engage in full=time practice.
  9 31 However, except for medical incapacity, an obligation to engage
  9 32 in practice shall not be postponed for more than two years from
  9 33 the time the full=time practice was to have commenced under the
  9 34 promise agreement.
  9 35    The practice obligation shall be considered satisfied when
 10  1 the terms of the agreement are completed or the person dies or
 10  2 is unable to practice due to a permanent disability.
 10  3    If an individual's obligation is not postponed or satisfied,
 10  4 and the person fails to fulfill the obligation to practice,
 10  5 the individual is subject to repayment to the commission of
 10  6 the amount paid by the commission to reduce the individual's
 10  7 educational loan interest rate plus interest as specified by
 10  8 rule.
 10  9    MEDICAL STUDENT PROMISE FUND CREATED.  A medical student
 10 10 promise fund is created as a revolving fund in the state
 10 11 treasury under the control of the commission and administered
 10 12 by the commission.  Moneys in the fund shall be used by the
 10 13 commission to reduce the interest rate charged to a medical
 10 14 student for an educational loan to a rate that is not more
 10 15 than half of the interest rate currently charged for federal
 10 16 educational loans.  Any loss to the fund shall be charged
 10 17 against the fund and the commission shall not be personally
 10 18 liable for such loss.  Moneys in the fund do not revert to the
 10 19 general fund of the state and interest or earnings on moneys in
 10 20 the fund are to be credited to the fund.
 10 21    INFORMATION/REPORTS/REVIEW.  On or before January 15 of each
 10 22 year, the commission, in cooperation with the department of
 10 23 revenue, must submit to the general assembly and the governor
 10 24 a report describing the commission's activities relating to
 10 25 the medical student promise fund during the preceding fiscal
 10 26 year, including information regarding the applications placed
 10 27 on the wait list, contributions made, certificates issued, and
 10 28 tax credits claimed.  An eligible university shall collect
 10 29 and provide to the commission any information required by the
 10 30 commission for administration of the fund.

  7 25                           EXPLANATION
  7 26 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  7 27 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  7 28    This bill establishes a medical student promise tax credit
  7 29 and a medical student promise fund under the control of the
  7 30 college student aid commission for the purpose of providing
  7 31 a means for reducing the interest rate charged to a medical
  7 32 student for an educational loan to an amount of interest that
  7 33 is not more than one=half of the interest rate currently
  7 34 charged for federal educational loans.
  7 35    TAX CREDIT.  The tax credit is allowed against the personal
  8  1 and corporate income tax, franchise tax, insurance premium tax,
  8  2 and the moneys and credits tax.
  8  3    To receive a certificate which may be redeemed for a tax
  8  4 credit, the taxpayer must submit an application to the college
  8  5 student aid commission. The commission must issue certificates
  8  6 on a first=come, first=served basis. In allocating tax
  8  7 credits, the commission shall allocate $1 million in the
  8  8 aggregate for certificates for tax credits, unless the
  8  9 commission determines that the tax credits awarded will be
  8 10 less than that amount.  If the amount of applications exceeds
  8 11 the available tax credits in a fiscal year, the commission is
  8 12 required to establish a wait list and give priority in later
  8 13 years to applications on the wait list.
  8 14    The taxpayer may transfer a tax credit once, and the bill
  8 15 establishes procedures for transferring the credit to another
  8 16 person.  Within 90 days of transfer, the transferee must submit
  8 17 the transferred tax credit certificate to the department of
  8 18 revenue along with a statement containing information specified
  8 19 in the bill. Within 30 days of receiving the transferred
  8 20 tax credit certificate and the transferee's statement, the
  8 21 department of revenue must issue one or more replacement tax
  8 22 credit certificates to the transferee. A replacement tax
  8 23 credit certificate may designate a different tax than the
  8 24 tax designated on the original tax credit certificate. Any
  8 25 consideration received for the transfer of the tax credit shall
  8 26 not be included as income.  Any consideration paid for the
  8 27 transfer of the tax credit shall not be deducted from income.
  8 28    The commission must, in cooperation with the department of
  8 29 revenue, establish criteria and procedures for the allocation
  8 30 and issuance of tax credits by means of certificates issued by
  8 31 the commission. The criteria shall include the contingencies
  8 32 that must be met for a certificate to be redeemable in order to
  8 33 receive a tax credit.
  8 34    Any tax credit in excess of the taxpayer's liability for the
  8 35 tax year may be credited to the tax liability for the following
  9  1 five years or until depleted, whichever is earlier. A tax
  9  2 credit shall not be carried back to a tax year prior to the tax
  9  3 year in which the taxpayer claims the tax credit.
  9  4    PROMISE AGREEMENT.  To be eligible for the reduction in
  9  5 the interest rate charged for an educational loan, a medical
  9  6 student must enter into a promise agreement with the commission
  9  7 and be enrolled full=time in an eligible university in a
  9  8 curriculum leading to an eligible degree.  "Eligible degree"
  9  9 means a master of physician assistant studies or a doctor of
  9 10 medicine, pharmacy, dental surgery, or osteopathy degree;
  9 11 and "eligible university" means the state university of Iowa
  9 12 college of medicine or Des Moines university == osteopathic
  9 13 medical center.
  9 14    Under the promise agreement, a medical student shall agree
  9 15 to and shall fulfill certain requirements, including completing
  9 16 a residency if applicable, applying for and obtaining a license
  9 17 to practice, residing in Iowa, and engaging in full=time
  9 18 practice in the state as a physician assistant, a dentist, or
  9 19 a doctor of medicine and surgery or osteopathic medicine and
  9 20 surgery, or pharmacist for a period of 60 consecutive months.
  9 21    The bill provides for the postponement and satisfaction
  9 22 of the obligation to practice full time in Iowa.  Practice
  9 23 may be postponed for certain purposes, such as active duty
  9 24 status in the armed forces, the armed forces military reserve,
  9 25 or the national guard; service in volunteers in service to
  9 26 America; service in the federal peace corps; a period of
  9 27 service commitment to the United States public health service
  9 28 commissioned corps; a period of religious missionary work; or
  9 29 any period of temporary medical incapacity during which the
  9 30 person obligated is unable to engage in full=time practice.
  9 31 However, except for medical incapacity, an obligation to engage
  9 32 in practice shall not be postponed for more than two years from
  9 33 the time the full=time practice was to have commenced under the
  9 34 promise agreement.
  9 35    The practice obligation shall be considered satisfied when
 10  1 the terms of the agreement are completed or the person dies or
 10  2 is unable to practice due to a permanent disability.
 10  3    If an individual's obligation is not postponed or satisfied,
 10  4 and the person fails to fulfill the obligation to practice,
 10  5 the individual is subject to repayment to the commission of
 10  6 the amount paid by the commission to reduce the individual's
 10  7 educational loan interest rate plus interest as specified by
 10  8 rule.
 10  9    MEDICAL STUDENT PROMISE FUND CREATED.  A medical student
 10 10 promise fund is created as a revolving fund in the state
 10 11 treasury under the control of the commission and administered
 10 12 by the commission.  Moneys in the fund shall be used by the
 10 13 commission to reduce the interest rate charged to a medical
 10 14 student for an educational loan to a rate that is not more
 10 15 than half of the interest rate currently charged for federal
 10 16 educational loans.  Any loss to the fund shall be charged
 10 17 against the fund and the commission shall not be personally
 10 18 liable for such loss.  Moneys in the fund do not revert to the

  7 25                           EXPLANATION
  7 26 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  7 27 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  7 28    This bill establishes a medical student promise tax credit
  7 29 and a medical student promise fund under the control of the
  7 30 college student aid commission for the purpose of providing
  7 31 a means for reducing the interest rate charged to a medical
  7 32 student for an educational loan to an amount of interest that
  7 33 is not more than one=half of the interest rate currently
  7 34 charged for federal educational loans.
  7 35    TAX CREDIT.  The tax credit is allowed against the personal
  8  1 and corporate income tax, franchise tax, insurance premium tax,
  8  2 and the moneys and credits tax.
  8  3    To receive a certificate which may be redeemed for a tax
  8  4 credit, the taxpayer must submit an application to the college
  8  5 student aid commission. The commission must issue certificates
  8  6 on a first=come, first=served basis. In allocating tax
  8  7 credits, the commission shall allocate $1 million in the
  8  8 aggregate for certificates for tax credits, unless the
  8  9 commission determines that the tax credits awarded will be
  8 10 less than that amount.  If the amount of applications exceeds
  8 11 the available tax credits in a fiscal year, the commission is
  8 12 required to establish a wait list and give priority in later
  8 13 years to applications on the wait list.
  8 14    The taxpayer may transfer a tax credit once, and the bill
  8 15 establishes procedures for transferring the credit to another
  8 16 person.  Within 90 days of transfer, the transferee must submit
  8 17 the transferred tax credit certificate to the department of
  8 18 revenue along with a statement containing information specified
  8 19 in the bill. Within 30 days of receiving the transferred
  8 20 tax credit certificate and the transferee's statement, the
  8 21 department of revenue must issue one or more replacement tax
  8 22 credit certificates to the transferee. A replacement tax
  8 23 credit certificate may designate a different tax than the
  8 24 tax designated on the original tax credit certificate. Any
  8 25 consideration received for the transfer of the tax credit shall
  8 26 not be included as income.  Any consideration paid for the
  8 27 transfer of the tax credit shall not be deducted from income.
  8 28    The commission must, in cooperation with the department of
  8 29 revenue, establish criteria and procedures for the allocation
  8 30 and issuance of tax credits by means of certificates issued by
  8 31 the commission. The criteria shall include the contingencies
  8 32 that must be met for a certificate to be redeemable in order to
  8 33 receive a tax credit.
  8 34    Any tax credit in excess of the taxpayer's liability for the
  8 35 tax year may be credited to the tax liability for the following
  9  1 five years or until depleted, whichever is earlier. A tax
  9  2 credit shall not be carried back to a tax year prior to the tax
  9  3 year in which the taxpayer claims the tax credit.
  9  4    PROMISE AGREEMENT.  To be eligible for the reduction in
  9  5 the interest rate charged for an educational loan, a medical
  9  6 student must enter into a promise agreement with the commission
  9  7 and be enrolled full=time in an eligible university in a
  9  8 curriculum leading to an eligible degree.  "Eligible degree"
  9  9 means a master of physician assistant studies or a doctor of
  9 10 medicine, pharmacy, dental surgery, or osteopathy degree;
  9 11 and "eligible university" means the state university of Iowa
  9 12 college of medicine or Des Moines university == osteopathic
  9 13 medical center.
  9 14    Under the promise agreement, a medical student shall agree
  9 15 to and shall fulfill certain requirements, including completing
  9 16 a residency if applicable, applying for and obtaining a license
  9 17 to practice, residing in Iowa, and engaging in full=time
  9 18 practice in the state as a physician assistant, a dentist, or
  9 19 a doctor of medicine and surgery or osteopathic medicine and
  9 20 surgery, or pharmacist for a period of 60 consecutive months.
  9 21    The bill provides for the postponement and satisfaction
  9 22 of the obligation to practice full time in Iowa.  Practice
  9 23 may be postponed for certain purposes, such as active duty
  9 24 status in the armed forces, the armed forces military reserve,
  9 25 or the national guard; service in volunteers in service to
  9 26 America; service in the federal peace corps; a period of
  9 27 service commitment to the United States public health service
  9 28 commissioned corps; a period of religious missionary work; or
  9 29 any period of temporary medical incapacity during which the
  9 30 person obligated is unable to engage in full=time practice.
  9 31 However, except for medical incapacity, an obligation to engage
  9 32 in practice shall not be postponed for more than two years from
  9 33 the time the full=time practice was to have commenced under the
  9 34 promise agreement.
  9 35    The practice obligation shall be considered satisfied when
 10  1 the terms of the agreement are completed or the person dies or
 10  2 is unable to practice due to a permanent disability.
 10  3    If an individual's obligation is not postponed or satisfied,
 10  4 and the person fails to fulfill the obligation to practice,
 10  5 the individual is subject to repayment to the commission of
 10  6 the amount paid by the commission to reduce the individual's
 10  7 educational loan interest rate plus interest as specified by
 10  8 rule.
 10  9    MEDICAL STUDENT PROMISE FUND CREATED.  A medical student
 10 10 promise fund is created as a revolving fund in the state
 10 11 treasury under the control of the commission and administered
 10 12 by the commission.  Moneys in the fund shall be used by the
 10 13 commission to reduce the interest rate charged to a medical
 10 14 student for an educational loan to a rate that is not more
 10 15 than half of the interest rate currently charged for federal
 10 16 educational loans.  Any loss to the fund shall be charged
 10 17 against the fund and the commission shall not be personally
 10 18 liable for such loss.  Moneys in the fund do not revert to the
 10 19 general fund of the state and interest or earnings on moneys in
 10 20 the fund are to be credited to the fund.
 10 21    INFORMATION/REPORTS/REVIEW.  On or before January 15 of each
 10 22 year, the commission, in cooperation with the department of
 10 23 revenue, must submit to the general assembly and the governor
 10 24 a report describing the commission's activities relating to
 10 25 the medical student promise fund during the preceding fiscal
 10 26 year, including information regarding the applications placed
 10 27 on the wait list, contributions made, certificates issued, and
 10 28 tax credits claimed.  An eligible university shall collect
 10 29 and provide to the commission any information required by the
 10 30 commission for administration of the fund.
 10 31    EFFECTIVE DATE AND RETROACTIVE APPLICABILITY PROVISIONS.
 10 32  The bill takes effect upon enactment and applies retroactively
 10 33 to January 1, 2015, for tax years beginning, and contributions
