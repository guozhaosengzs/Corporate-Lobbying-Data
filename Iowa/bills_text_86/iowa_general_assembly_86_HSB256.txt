by

This
bill
makes
changes
relating
to
state
taxes
and
revenue

by
creating
an
alternative
base
income
tax
and
modifying
the
7


state
sales
and

tax
rates
and
the
distribution
of
revenues

from
the
natural

fund.

DIVISION
I
——
SALES
AND
USE
TAXES.
Division
I
relates
to
10


state
sales
and
use
taxes
and
to
an
amendment
to
the
Iowa
11


Constitution
ratified
on
November
2,
2010,
which
created
a
12


natural
resources
and
outdoor
recreation
trust
fund
(fund)
13


and
dedicated
a
portion
of
state
revenues
to
the
fund
for
14


the
purposes
of
protecting
and
enhancing
water
quality
and
15


natural
areas
in
the
state
including
parks,
trails,
and
fish
16


and
wildlife
habitat,
and
conserving
agricultural
soils
in
17


the
state
(Article
VII,
section
10).
The
fund
is
codified
in
18


Code
section
461.31.
Pursuant
to
the
amendment,
the
amount
19


credited
to
the
fund
will
be
equal
to
the
amount
generated
20


by
an
increase
in
the
state
sales
tax
rate
occurring
after
21


the
effective
date
of
the
constitutional
amendment,
but
shall
22


not
exceed
the
amount
that
a
state
sales
tax
rate
of
0.375
23


percent
would
generate.
The
state
sales
tax
rate
has
not
24


been
increased
since
the
effective
date
of
the
constitutional
25


amendment,
so
no
amounts
have
been
credited
to
the
fund.
The
26


division
increases
the
sales
tax
rate
and
the
use
tax
rate
27


from
6
percent
to
6.125
percent
on
July
1,
2016,
from
6.125
28


percent
to
6.25
percent
on
July
1,
2017,
and
from
6.25
percent
29


to
6.375
percent
on
July
1,
2018.
The
division
also
amends
the
30


transfer
of
use
tax
revenues
to
the
secure
an
advanced
vision
31


for
education

SAVE
receives
approximately
the
same
proportion
of
the
total
33


use
tax
revenue
as
it
did
prior
to
the
use
tax
rate
increases

provided
