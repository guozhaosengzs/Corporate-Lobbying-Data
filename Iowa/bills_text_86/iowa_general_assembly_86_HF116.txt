  3  5 adoption. The bill defines "child" as a person under six years
  3  6 of age.
  3  7    The bill provides that an employment policy or practice
  3  8 which excludes from employment applicants or employees because
  3  9 of the employee's adoption is a prima facie violation of Code

  3 11    The bill provides that an employee's absence due to an
  3 12 adoption shall, for all job=related purposes, be treated in

  3 16 policies and practices involving certain matters such as the
  3 17 commencement and duration of leave, the accrual of seniority,

  3 19 or sick leave plan shall be applied to an employee's absence
  3 20 due to an adoption on the same terms and conditions as they are
  3 21 applied to temporary disabilities.
  3 22    The bill prohibits an employer from terminating the
  3 23 employment of a person absent due to an adoption because of the
  3 24 employee's absence.

  3 33 adoption, or for eight weeks, whichever is less.  The employee
  3 34 must provide timely notice of the period of leave requested.
  3 35 The employer may first require that the employee's adoption
  4  1 of a child be verified by documentation and that the employee
  4  2 certify that the employee will not able to reasonably perform
  4  3 the duties of employment because the employee will be preparing
