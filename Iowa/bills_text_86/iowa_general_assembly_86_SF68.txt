  1 10 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  1 11    Current law prohibits a person from attaching a frame
  1 12 around or over the person's motor vehicle registration plate
  1 13 if the frame covers any numerals or letters printed on the
  1 14 registration plate. This bill narrows this prohibition to
  1 15 include only frames that cover the validation sticker or the
  1 16 registration plate number. The scheduled fine for a violation
  1 17 of this provision remains $20.
