  5  6 or other governmental entity shall not authorize imposition

  5  8 because the resident, owner, tenant, or landlord sought law
  5  9 enforcement assistance for a victim of abuse, a victim of
  5 10 crime, or an individual in an emergency if either the resident,
  5 11 owner, tenant, or landlord seeking assistance had a reasonable
  5 12 belief that the assistance was necessary or if the emergency
  5 13 assistance was actually needed. The bill does not prohibit a
  5 14 city, county, or other governmental entity from enforcing any
  5 15 ordinance, rule, or regulation premised upon grounds other than
  5 16 a request for law enforcement assistance or other emergency
  5 17 assistance for a victim of abuse, a victim of a crime, or an
