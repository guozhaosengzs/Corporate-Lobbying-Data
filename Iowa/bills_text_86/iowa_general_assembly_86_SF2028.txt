  2 35    The bill defines "energy efficiency improvement" to mean an
  3  1 installed measure that is intended to reduce energy consumption
  3  2 or costs, or both, or to allow the use of alternative
  3  3 and renewable energy, including repairing, replacing, or
  3  4 installing a roof or lighting system, window, door, or heating,
