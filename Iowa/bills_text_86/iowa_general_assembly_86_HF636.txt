  5  9 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  5 10 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  5 11    This bill concerns wagering taxes on gambling game receipts
  5 12 as provided in Code chapter 99F.
  5 13    Code section 99F.1 is amended by adding two new definitions.
  5 14 "Promotional play receipts" is defined as the total sums
  5 15 wagered on gambling games with tokens, chips, electronic
  5 16 credits, or other forms of cashless wagering provided by
  5 17 a licensee without an exchange of money.  "Taxable gross
  5 18 receipts" is defined as adjusted gross receipts less
  5 19 promotional play receipts.
  5 20    Code section 99F.11, providing for the wagering tax, is
  5 21 amended to provide that the wagering tax is calculated on the
  5 22 taxable gross receipts of a gambling game licensee instead of
  5 23 the adjusted gross receipts.
  5 24    New Code section 99F.11A provides for a wagering tax on
  5 25 promotional play receipts.  The Code section provides for the
  5 26 tax rate on promotional play receipts and provides for the
  5 27 distribution of taxes received from promotional play receipts.
  5 28 The bill specifies the tax rate as the rate applied to taxable
  5 29 gross receipts over $3 million and specifies that the tax
  5 30 receipts from promotional play are to be distributed to cities
  5 31 and counties where the gambling structures are located, the
  5 32 county endowment fund, the community development division of
  5 33 the economic development authority, and to the rebuild Iowa
  5 34 infrastructure fund created in Code section 8.57, in a manner
  5 35 based on the distribution of wagering taxes in Code section
  6  1 99F.11.  The bill then provides that the total taxes paid by
  6  2 all gambling game licensees on promotional play receipts shall
  6  3 not exceed a certain dollar amount for designated fiscal years.
  6  4 For the fiscal year beginning July 1, 2015, total taxes paid
  6  5 shall not exceed $27 million.  For each successive fiscal year,
  6  6 the maximum of total taxes paid by all licensees is reduced
  6  7 by $5 million until the total taxes paid for the fiscal year
  6  8 beginning July 1, 2020, shall not exceed $2 million.  The new
  6  9 Code section is repealed July 1, 2021.

  5 26 tax rate on promotional play receipts and provides for the
  5 27 distribution of taxes received from promotional play receipts.
  5 28 The bill specifies the tax rate as the rate applied to taxable

  5 34 infrastructure fund created in Code section 8.57, in a manner
  5 35 based on the distribution of wagering taxes in Code section
  6  1 99F.11.  The bill then provides that the total taxes paid by

  5 15 wagered on gambling games with tokens, chips, electronic
  5 16 credits, or other forms of cashless wagering provided by
  5 17 a licensee without an exchange of money.  "Taxable gross
  5 18 receipts" is defined as adjusted gross receipts less
  5 19 promotional play receipts.
  5 20    Code section 99F.11, providing for the wagering tax, is
  5 21 amended to provide that the wagering tax is calculated on the
  5 22 taxable gross receipts of a gambling game licensee instead of
  5 23 the adjusted gross receipts.
  5 24    New Code section 99F.11A provides for a wagering tax on
  5 25 promotional play receipts.  The Code section provides for the
  5 26 tax rate on promotional play receipts and provides for the
  5 27 distribution of taxes received from promotional play receipts.
  5 28 The bill specifies the tax rate as the rate applied to taxable
  5 29 gross receipts over $3 million and specifies that the tax
  5 30 receipts from promotional play are to be distributed to cities
  5 31 and counties where the gambling structures are located, the

  5 34 infrastructure fund created in Code section 8.57, in a manner
  5 35 based on the distribution of wagering taxes in Code section
  6  1 99F.11.  The bill then provides that the total taxes paid by
  6  2 all gambling game licensees on promotional play receipts shall
  6  3 not exceed a certain dollar amount for designated fiscal years.
  6  4 For the fiscal year beginning July 1, 2015, total taxes paid
  6  5 shall not exceed $27 million.  For each successive fiscal year,
  6  6 the maximum of total taxes paid by all licensees is reduced
  6  7 by $5 million until the total taxes paid for the fiscal year
  6  8 beginning July 1, 2020, shall not exceed $2 million.  The new
  6  9 Code section is repealed July 1, 2021.

  5  9 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  5 10 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  5 11    This bill concerns wagering taxes on gambling game receipts
  5 12 as provided in Code chapter 99F.
  5 13    Code section 99F.1 is amended by adding two new definitions.
  5 14 "Promotional play receipts" is defined as the total sums
  5 15 wagered on gambling games with tokens, chips, electronic
  5 16 credits, or other forms of cashless wagering provided by
  5 17 a licensee without an exchange of money.  "Taxable gross
  5 18 receipts" is defined as adjusted gross receipts less
  5 19 promotional play receipts.
  5 20    Code section 99F.11, providing for the wagering tax, is
  5 21 amended to provide that the wagering tax is calculated on the
  5 22 taxable gross receipts of a gambling game licensee instead of
  5 23 the adjusted gross receipts.
  5 24    New Code section 99F.11A provides for a wagering tax on
  5 25 promotional play receipts.  The Code section provides for the
  5 26 tax rate on promotional play receipts and provides for the
  5 27 distribution of taxes received from promotional play receipts.
  5 28 The bill specifies the tax rate as the rate applied to taxable
  5 29 gross receipts over $3 million and specifies that the tax
  5 30 receipts from promotional play are to be distributed to cities
  5 31 and counties where the gambling structures are located, the
  5 32 county endowment fund, the community development division of
  5 33 the economic development authority, and to the rebuild Iowa
  5 34 infrastructure fund created in Code section 8.57, in a manner
  5 35 based on the distribution of wagering taxes in Code section
  6  1 99F.11.  The bill then provides that the total taxes paid by
  6  2 all gambling game licensees on promotional play receipts shall
  6  3 not exceed a certain dollar amount for designated fiscal years.
  6  4 For the fiscal year beginning July 1, 2015, total taxes paid
  6  5 shall not exceed $27 million.  For each successive fiscal year,
  6  6 the maximum of total taxes paid by all licensees is reduced
  6  7 by $5 million until the total taxes paid for the fiscal year
  6  8 beginning July 1, 2020, shall not exceed $2 million.  The new
  6  9 Code section is repealed July 1, 2021.

  5  9 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  5 10 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  5 11    This bill concerns wagering taxes on gambling game receipts
  5 12 as provided in Code chapter 99F.
  5 13    Code section 99F.1 is amended by adding two new definitions.
  5 14 "Promotional play receipts" is defined as the total sums
  5 15 wagered on gambling games with tokens, chips, electronic
  5 16 credits, or other forms of cashless wagering provided by
  5 17 a licensee without an exchange of money.  "Taxable gross
  5 18 receipts" is defined as adjusted gross receipts less
  5 19 promotional play receipts.
  5 20    Code section 99F.11, providing for the wagering tax, is
  5 21 amended to provide that the wagering tax is calculated on the
  5 22 taxable gross receipts of a gambling game licensee instead of
  5 23 the adjusted gross receipts.
  5 24    New Code section 99F.11A provides for a wagering tax on
  5 25 promotional play receipts.  The Code section provides for the
  5 26 tax rate on promotional play receipts and provides for the
  5 27 distribution of taxes received from promotional play receipts.
  5 28 The bill specifies the tax rate as the rate applied to taxable
  5 29 gross receipts over $3 million and specifies that the tax
  5 30 receipts from promotional play are to be distributed to cities
  5 31 and counties where the gambling structures are located, the
  5 32 county endowment fund, the community development division of
  5 33 the economic development authority, and to the rebuild Iowa
  5 34 infrastructure fund created in Code section 8.57, in a manner
  5 35 based on the distribution of wagering taxes in Code section
  6  1 99F.11.  The bill then provides that the total taxes paid by
  6  2 all gambling game licensees on promotional play receipts shall
  6  3 not exceed a certain dollar amount for designated fiscal years.
  6  4 For the fiscal year beginning July 1, 2015, total taxes paid
  6  5 shall not exceed $27 million.  For each successive fiscal year,
  6  6 the maximum of total taxes paid by all licensees is reduced

  5 16 credits, or other forms of cashless wagering provided by
  5 17 a licensee without an exchange of money.  "Taxable gross
  5 18 receipts" is defined as adjusted gross receipts less
  5 19 promotional play receipts.
  5 20    Code section 99F.11, providing for the wagering tax, is
  5 21 amended to provide that the wagering tax is calculated on the
  5 22 taxable gross receipts of a gambling game licensee instead of
  5 23 the adjusted gross receipts.
  5 24    New Code section 99F.11A provides for a wagering tax on
  5 25 promotional play receipts.  The Code section provides for the
  5 26 tax rate on promotional play receipts and provides for the
  5 27 distribution of taxes received from promotional play receipts.
  5 28 The bill specifies the tax rate as the rate applied to taxable
  5 29 gross receipts over $3 million and specifies that the tax
  5 30 receipts from promotional play are to be distributed to cities
  5 31 and counties where the gambling structures are located, the

  5 34 infrastructure fund created in Code section 8.57, in a manner
  5 35 based on the distribution of wagering taxes in Code section
  6  1 99F.11.  The bill then provides that the total taxes paid by
  6  2 all gambling game licensees on promotional play receipts shall
  6  3 not exceed a certain dollar amount for designated fiscal years.
  6  4 For the fiscal year beginning July 1, 2015, total taxes paid
  6  5 shall not exceed $27 million.  For each successive fiscal year,
  6  6 the maximum of total taxes paid by all licensees is reduced
  6  7 by $5 million until the total taxes paid for the fiscal year
  6  8 beginning July 1, 2020, shall not exceed $2 million.  The new
