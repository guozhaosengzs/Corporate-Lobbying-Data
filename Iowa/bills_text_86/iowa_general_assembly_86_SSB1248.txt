29


the
county
where
the
mortgage
is
recorded.
30


The
bill
also
provides
that
after
payment
of
the
mortgage
in
31

the
owner
of
the
property
may
serve
the

of
the
mortgage

recording
of
a
proper
33


instrument
of
satisfaction.

five-year
period,
the
minimum
damage
award

increase,
the
minimum
damage
17


award
amount
will
remain
the
