  1 14 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with

  1 16    Generally, a motor vehicle is required to display two
  1 17 registration plates, with one on the front of the vehicle
  1 18 and one on the rear of the vehicle. Current law allows
  1 19 motor vehicles which are model year 1948 or older, or are
  1 20 reconstructed or specially constructed to resemble a model year
  1 21 1948 vehicle or older, to display only one registration plate
  1 22 on the rear of the vehicle if the other registration plate
  1 23 issued to the vehicle is carried in the vehicle at all times
  1 24 when the vehicle is operated on a public highway.
  1 25    This bill broadens that exception to include any motor
  1 26 vehicle originally manufactured with a front bumper that sits
