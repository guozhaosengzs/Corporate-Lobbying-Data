  3 25 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  3 26    This bill creates a disaster case management grant fund and
  3 27 program.
  3 28    The bill replaces provisions relating to disaster case
  3 29 management with a disaster case management fund.  Moneys in
  3 30 the fund must be expended if individual assistance grants
  3 31 are awarded following the governor's proclamation of a
  3 32 state of disaster emergency or the declaration of a major
  3 33 disaster by the president of the United States.  The bill
  3 34 allows the executive council to make financial grants to meet
  3 35 disaster=related case management needs of disaster=affected
  4  1 individuals.  The aggregate total of grants awarded shall not
  4  2 be more than $1 million during a fiscal year; however, within
  4  3 the same fiscal year, additional funds may be specifically
  4  4 authorized by the executive council to meet additional needs.
  4  5 Of the $1 million aggregate total, $50,000 may be expended for
  4  6 contract entity staff support, and $50,000 may be expended for
  4  7 case management training and continuing training.
  4  8    The bill requires the department of human services to
  4  9 work with the department of homeland security and emergency
  4 10 management and, as selected by the department of human
  4 11 services, a representative of nonprofit, voluntary, and
  4 12 faith=based organizations active in disaster recovery
  4 13 and response to establish a statewide system of disaster
  4 14 case management to be activated following the governor's
  4 15 proclamation of a disaster emergency or the declaration of
  4 16 a major disaster by the president of the United States for
  4 17 individual assistance purposes.
  4 18    The bill requires the department of human services to
  4 19 administer the disaster case management grants.  The bill
  4 20 requires the department of human services, in conjunction with
  4 21 the department of homeland security and emergency management,
  4 22 to establish an Iowa disaster case management program and adopt
  4 23 rules pursuant to Code chapter 17A necessary to administer
  4 24 the program.  The executive council shall use grant moneys to
  4 25 reimburse the department of human services for actual expenses
  4 26 associated with the administration of the grants.  Under the
  4 27 program, the bill requires the department of human services
  4 28 to coordinate case management services locally through one or
  4 29 more contracted entities.  The department of human services is
  4 30 required to implement an ongoing contract with a provider of a
  4 31 statewide program with local offices throughout the state to
  4 32 serve as the local administrative entity for the grant program
  4 33 to allow implementation of the program with minimal delay if
  4 34 individual assistance grants are awarded following a governor's
  4 35 proclamation of a state of disaster emergency or a declaration
  5  1 of a major disaster by the president of the United States.
  5  2    The bill requires the department of human services, in
  5  3 conjunction with the department of homeland security and
  5  4 emergency management and a representative of the Iowa voluntary
  5  5 organizations active in disaster, to adopt rules pursuant
  5  6 to Code chapter 17A to create coordination mechanisms and
  5  7 standards for the establishment and implementation of a
  5  8 statewide system of disaster case management.
  5  9    The bill includes an annual reporting requirement.

  3 33 disaster by the president of the United States.  The bill
  3 34 allows the executive council to make financial grants to meet
  3 35 disaster=related case management needs of disaster=affected
  4  1 individuals.  The aggregate total of grants awarded shall not
  4  2 be more than $1 million during a fiscal year; however, within

  4 13 and response to establish a statewide system of disaster
  4 14 case management to be activated following the governor's
  4 15 proclamation of a disaster emergency or the declaration of
  4 16 a major disaster by the president of the United States for
  4 17 individual assistance purposes.
  4 18    The bill requires the department of human services to
  4 19 administer the disaster case management grants.  The bill
  4 20 requires the department of human services, in conjunction with
  4 21 the department of homeland security and emergency management,
  4 22 to establish an Iowa disaster case management program and adopt
  4 23 rules pursuant to Code chapter 17A necessary to administer
  4 24 the program.  The executive council shall use grant moneys to
  4 25 reimburse the department of human services for actual expenses
  4 26 associated with the administration of the grants.  Under the
  4 27 program, the bill requires the department of human services
  4 28 to coordinate case management services locally through one or
  4 29 more contracted entities.  The department of human services is
  4 30 required to implement an ongoing contract with a provider of a
  4 31 statewide program with local offices throughout the state to
  4 32 serve as the local administrative entity for the grant program
  4 33 to allow implementation of the program with minimal delay if
  4 34 individual assistance grants are awarded following a governor's
  4 35 proclamation of a state of disaster emergency or a declaration
  5  1 of a major disaster by the president of the United States.
  5  2    The bill requires the department of human services, in

  5  4 emergency management and a representative of the Iowa voluntary
  5  5 organizations active in disaster, to adopt rules pursuant

  4  1 individuals.  The aggregate total of grants awarded shall not
  4  2 be more than $1 million during a fiscal year; however, within
  4  3 the same fiscal year, additional funds may be specifically
  4  4 authorized by the executive council to meet additional needs.

  4 13 and response to establish a statewide system of disaster
  4 14 case management to be activated following the governor's
  4 15 proclamation of a disaster emergency or the declaration of
  4 16 a major disaster by the president of the United States for
  4 17 individual assistance purposes.
  4 18    The bill requires the department of human services to
  4 19 administer the disaster case management grants.  The bill
  4 20 requires the department of human services, in conjunction with
  4 21 the department of homeland security and emergency management,
  4 22 to establish an Iowa disaster case management program and adopt

  4 24 the program.  The executive council shall use grant moneys to
  4 25 reimburse the department of human services for actual expenses
  4 26 associated with the administration of the grants.  Under the
  4 27 program, the bill requires the department of human services
  4 28 to coordinate case management services locally through one or
  4 29 more contracted entities.  The department of human services is
  4 30 required to implement an ongoing contract with a provider of a
  4 31 statewide program with local offices throughout the state to
  4 32 serve as the local administrative entity for the grant program
  4 33 to allow implementation of the program with minimal delay if

  4 35 proclamation of a state of disaster emergency or a declaration
  5  1 of a major disaster by the president of the United States.

  3 34 allows the executive council to make financial grants to meet
  3 35 disaster=related case management needs of disaster=affected
  4  1 individuals.  The aggregate total of grants awarded shall not
  4  2 be more than $1 million during a fiscal year; however, within
  4  3 the same fiscal year, additional funds may be specifically
  4  4 authorized by the executive council to meet additional needs.

  4  6 contract entity staff support, and $50,000 may be expended for
  4  7 case management training and continuing training.
  4  8    The bill requires the department of human services to
  4  9 work with the department of homeland security and emergency
  4 10 management and, as selected by the department of human
  4 11 services, a representative of nonprofit, voluntary, and

  4 13 and response to establish a statewide system of disaster
  4 14 case management to be activated following the governor's
  4 15 proclamation of a disaster emergency or the declaration of
  4 16 a major disaster by the president of the United States for
  4 17 individual assistance purposes.

  4 24 the program.  The executive council shall use grant moneys to
  4 25 reimburse the department of human services for actual expenses
  4 26 associated with the administration of the grants.  Under the
  4 27 program, the bill requires the department of human services
  4 28 to coordinate case management services locally through one or
  4 29 more contracted entities.  The department of human services is
  4 30 required to implement an ongoing contract with a provider of a
  4 31 statewide program with local offices throughout the state to
  4 32 serve as the local administrative entity for the grant program
  4 33 to allow implementation of the program with minimal delay if
  4 34 individual assistance grants are awarded following a governor's
  4 35 proclamation of a state of disaster emergency or a declaration
  5  1 of a major disaster by the president of the United States.
  5  2    The bill requires the department of human services, in
