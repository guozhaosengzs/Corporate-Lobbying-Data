  1  6 a urine, oral fluid, or blood test in which the level of
  1  7 controlled substances or their metabolites in the sample
  1  8 analyzed meets or exceeds nationally accepted standards for
  1  9 determining detectable levels of controlled substances as
  1 10 adopted by the federal substance abuse and mental health
  1 11 services administration.  If nationally accepted standards for
  1 12 oral fluid tests have not been adopted by the federal substance
  1 13 abuse and mental health services administration, the standards
  1 14 for determining detectable levels of controlled substances for
  1 15 purposes of determining a confirmed positive test result shall
  1 16 be the same standard that has been established by the federal
  1 17 food and drug administration for the measuring instrument used
  1 18 to perform the oral fluid test.
  1 19    b.  "Licensed substance abuse treatment program" means an
  1 20 inpatient or outpatient substance abuse treatment program
  1 21 licensed by the department of public health under chapter 125.
  1 22    c.  "Sample" means a sample from the human body capable
  1 23 of revealing the presence of controlled substances, or their
  1 24 metabolites, which shall include only urine, saliva, or blood.
  1 25    2.  a.  The drug testing requirements of this section apply
  1 26 to the following applicants for and recipients of assistance
  1 27 under this chapter:
  1 28    (1)  Each adult parent, guardian, or specified relative who
  1 29 is included in the applicant family, including both parents of
  1 30 a two=parent family, or an individual who may be exempt from
  1 31 work activity requirements due to the age of the youngest child
  1 32 or who may be exempt from work activity requirements under the
  1 33 PROMISE JOBS program.
  1 34    (2)  A minor parent who is not required to live with a

  2  2    (3)  A recipient of assistance who provided a written
  2  3 acknowledgment of the drug testing requirements of this
  2  4 section at the time of application for assistance and for whom
  2  5 there is information indicating a significant likelihood the
  2  6 recipient is using a controlled substance, as determined by the
  2  7 department, shall be subject to random drug testing.
  2  8    b.  Dependent children under the age of eighteen years are
  2  9 exempt from the drug testing requirements of this section.
  2 10    c.  The department shall require a drug test that is similar
  2 11 to a drug test as a condition of employment under section 730.5
  2 12 to screen the persons subject to this section for the presence
  2 13 of controlled substances.  The person is responsible for the
  2 14 cost of the person's drug test.
  2 15    3.  a.  A person who is subject to this section is ineligible
  2 16 to receive assistance under this chapter if the person does not
  2 17 participate in the required drug testing.
  2 18    b.  A person who is subject to this section is ineligible
  2 19 to receive assistance under this chapter if the person has a
  2 20 confirmed positive test result for the presence of either of
  2 21 the following:
  2 22    (1)  A substance listed in schedule I under section 124.204.
  2 23    (2)  A substance listed in schedule II, III, or IV under
  2 24 chapter 124 that was not prescribed for the person.
  2 25    c.  The period of ineligibility for an applicant or recipient

  2 29 implementing this section:
  2 30    a.  (1)  Provide notice of drug testing to each person who is
  2 31 subject to this section at the time of application. The notice
  2 32 must advise the person that drug testing will be conducted as a
  2 33 condition for receiving assistance under this chapter and that
  2 34 the person must bear the cost of testing. The applicant shall
  2 35 be advised that the required drug testing may be avoided if the
  3  1 applicant does not complete or withdraws the application for
  3  2 assistance.
  3  3    (2)  Advise each person to be tested, before the test
  3  4 is conducted, that the person may, but is not required to,
  3  5 inform the agent administering the test of any prescription or
  3  6 over=the=counter medication the person is taking.
  3  7    (3)  Require each person to be tested to sign a written
  3  8 acknowledgment that the person has received and understood the
  3  9 notice and advice provided under this paragraph "a".
  3 10    b.  Assure each person being tested a reasonable degree
  3 11 of dignity while producing and submitting a sample for drug
  3 12 testing, consistent with the department's need to ensure the
  3 13 reliability of the sample.
  3 14    c.  Specify circumstances under which a person with a
  3 15 confirmed positive test result has the right to take one or
  3 16 more additional tests.
  3 17    d.  Inform a person who has a confirmed positive test result
  3 18 and is deemed ineligible for assistance that the person may
  3 19 not reapply for assistance until one year after the date of
  3 20 the confirmed positive test result unless the person meets the
  3 21 requirements of paragraph "f". If the person has a subsequent
  3 22 confirmed positive test result, the person shall be ineligible
  3 23 to receive assistance for three years after the date of the
  3 24 subsequent result unless the person meets the requirements of
  3 25 paragraph "f".
  3 26    e.  Provide any person with a confirmed positive test result
  3 27 with a list of licensed substance abuse treatment programs
  3 28 available in the area in which the person resides. Neither the
  3 29 department nor the state is responsible for providing or paying
  3 30 for substance abuse treatment as part of the drug testing
  3 31 conducted under this section.
  3 32    f.  A person with a confirmed positive test result who is
  3 33 denied assistance under this chapter may reapply for assistance
  3 34 after six months if the person can document the successful
  3 35 completion of a licensed substance abuse treatment program.
  4  1 A person who has met the requirements of this paragraph and
  4  2 reapplies for assistance must also pass the initial drug test
  4  3 required under subsection 2. Any drug test conducted while the
  4  4 person is undergoing substance abuse treatment must meet the
  4  5 requirements for a drug test under subsection 2. The cost of
  4  6 any drug testing or substance abuse treatment provided under
  4  7 this subsection shall be the responsibility of the person being
  4  8 tested or receiving treatment. A person with a confirmed
  4  9 positive test result from the drug test required under
  4 10 subsection 2 may reapply for assistance under this paragraph
  4 11 only once.
  4 12    5.  If an applicant or recipient parent is deemed ineligible
  4 13 for assistance as a result of having a confirmed positive test
  4 14 result from a drug test conducted under this section, all of
  4 15 the following apply:
  4 16    a.  The eligibility of the applicant's or recipient's
  4 17 dependent child for assistance is not affected.
  4 18    b.  An appropriate protective payee shall be designated
  4 19 to receive assistance on behalf of the dependent child.
  4 20 The parent may choose to designate an individual as the
  4 21 protective payee. The individual designated by the parent as
  4 22 the protective payee must be a specified relative or other
  4 23 immediate family member unless such family member is not
  4 24 available or the family member declines the designation. In
  4 25 which case another individual, approved by the department,
  4 26 shall be designated as the protective payee. The individual
  4 27 must also undergo drug testing before being approved to be
  4 28 the protective payee. If the designated individual has a
  4 29 confirmed positive test result, the designated individual shall
  4 30 be ineligible to be the protective payee.
  4 31    6.  The department shall adopt rules to implement this
  4 32 section.
  4 33                           EXPLANATION
  4 34 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  4 35 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  5  1 This bill requires drug testing of applicants for and
  5  2 certain recipients of assistance under the family investment
  5  3 program (FIP) in new Code section 239B.2D.  The program
  5  4 provides cash assistance and employment=related services to
  5  5 low=income families with children under the federal temporary
  5  6 assistance for needy families (TANF) block grant.  The
  5  7 department of human services administers the program and block
  5  8 grant for this state.
  5  9    The bill utilizes the following terms that are defined in
  5 10 Code section 239B.1:
  5 11    "Applicant" means a person who files an application for
  5 12 participation in FIP under Code chapter 239B.
  5 13    "Assistance" means a FIP payment.
  5 14    "Family" means a family unit that includes at least one
  5 15 child and at least one parent or other specified relative of
  5 16 the child.
  5 17    "Minor parent" means an applicant or participant parent who
  5 18 is less than 18 years of age and has never been married.
  5 19    "PROMISE JOBS program" or "JOBS program" means the promoting
  5 20 independence and self=sufficiency through employment job
  5 21 opportunities and basic skills program, a part of FIP.
  5 22    "Specified relative" means a person who is, or was at any
  5 23 time, a relative of an applicant or participant child, by means
  5 24 of blood relationship, marriage, or adoption, or is a spouse of
  5 25 a relative listed in the definition.
  5 26    The bill defines "confirmed positive test result", "licensed
  5 27 substance abuse treatment program", and "sample".
  5 28    The drug testing requirement applies to each applicant for
  5 29 FIP assistance who is an adult parent, guardian, or specified
  5 30 relative who is included in the applicant family, including
  5 31 both parents of a two=parent family, or an individual who may
  5 32 be exempt from work activity requirements due to the age of the
  5 33 youngest child or who may be exempt from work activity under
  5 34 the PROMISE JOBS program.  The requirement also applies to
  5 35 each minor parent applicant who is not required to live with
  6  1 a parent, guardian, or other adult caretaker.  In addition,
  6  2 a recipient of assistance who accepted the drug testing
  6  3 requirements at the time of application and for whom there is
  6  4 information indicating a significant likelihood the recipient
  6  5 is using a controlled substance is subject to random drug
  6  6 testing. Dependent children under the age of 18 years are
  6  7 exempt from the drug testing requirements. The department is
  6  8 directed to require a drug test of each person who is subject
  6  9 to the requirements to screen for the presence of controlled
  6 10 substances.  The person is responsible for the cost of the drug
  6 11 test.
  6 12    A person subject to the requirement who does not participate
  6 13 in the required drug testing is ineligible for cash assistance
  6 14 through FIP.  A person who has a confirmed positive test result
  6 15 is ineligible for one year unless the test result was for a
  6 16 controlled substance for which the person has a prescription.
  6 17    The department is required to do all of the following
  6 18 in administering the drug testing requirement:  implement
  6 19 notification provisions; allow for additional testing following
  6 20 a confirmed positive test result; apply a three=year period
  6 21 of ineligibility if a person reapplies but has a subsequent
  6 22 confirmed positive test result; provide a listing of licensed
  6 23 substance abuse treatment programs available in the area of a
  6 24 person's residence if the person has a confirmed positive test
  6 25 result; and allow for a person who has a confirmed positive
  6 26 test result to reapply one time after six months if the person
  6 27 provides documentation of completing a licensed substance abuse
  6 28 treatment program within six months of the confirmed positive
  6 29 test result and passes another drug test.
  6 30    If a parent is deemed ineligible for assistance as a result
  6 31 of having a confirmed positive test result, the dependent child
  6 32 remains eligible for assistance and a protective payee may be
  6 33 designated by the parent to receive the assistance on behalf of
  6 34 the child.  If a specified relative or other immediate family
  6 35 member declines to be designated, the department must designate
  7  1 the protective payee.  The protective payee is then subject
  7  2 to drug testing before being approved to receive assistance
  7  3 on behalf of the child.  A protective payee with a confirmed
  7  4 positive test result is ineligible to receive assistance on
  7  5 behalf of the child.
  7  6    The department is required to adopt rules to implement the
  7  7 new requirements.

  4 33                           EXPLANATION
  4 34 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  4 35 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  5  1 This bill requires drug testing of applicants for and
  5  2 certain recipients of assistance under the family investment
  5  3 program (FIP) in new Code section 239B.2D.  The program
  5  4 provides cash assistance and employment=related services to
  5  5 low=income families with children under the federal temporary
  5  6 assistance for needy families (TANF) block grant.  The
  5  7 department of human services administers the program and block
  5  8 grant for this state.
  5  9    The bill utilizes the following terms that are defined in
  5 10 Code section 239B.1:
  5 11    "Applicant" means a person who files an application for
  5 12 participation in FIP under Code chapter 239B.
  5 13    "Assistance" means a FIP payment.
  5 14    "Family" means a family unit that includes at least one

  5 21 opportunities and basic skills program, a part of FIP.
  5 22    "Specified relative" means a person who is, or was at any
  5 23 time, a relative of an applicant or participant child, by means
  5 24 of blood relationship, marriage, or adoption, or is a spouse of
  5 25 a relative listed in the definition.
  5 26    The bill defines "confirmed positive test result", "licensed
  5 27 substance abuse treatment program", and "sample".
  5 28    The drug testing requirement applies to each applicant for
  5 29 FIP assistance who is an adult parent, guardian, or specified
  5 30 relative who is included in the applicant family, including
  5 31 both parents of a two=parent family, or an individual who may
  5 32 be exempt from work activity requirements due to the age of the
  5 33 youngest child or who may be exempt from work activity under
  5 34 the PROMISE JOBS program.  The requirement also applies to
  5 35 each minor parent applicant who is not required to live with
  6  1 a parent, guardian, or other adult caretaker.  In addition,
  6  2 a recipient of assistance who accepted the drug testing
  6  3 requirements at the time of application and for whom there is
  6  4 information indicating a significant likelihood the recipient
  6  5 is using a controlled substance is subject to random drug
  6  6 testing. Dependent children under the age of 18 years are
  6  7 exempt from the drug testing requirements. The department is
  6  8 directed to require a drug test of each person who is subject
  6  9 to the requirements to screen for the presence of controlled
  6 10 substances.  The person is responsible for the cost of the drug
  6 11 test.
  6 12    A person subject to the requirement who does not participate
  6 13 in the required drug testing is ineligible for cash assistance
  6 14 through FIP.  A person who has a confirmed positive test result
  6 15 is ineligible for one year unless the test result was for a
  6 16 controlled substance for which the person has a prescription.
  6 17    The department is required to do all of the following
  6 18 in administering the drug testing requirement:  implement
  6 19 notification provisions; allow for additional testing following
  6 20 a confirmed positive test result; apply a three=year period
  6 21 of ineligibility if a person reapplies but has a subsequent
  6 22 confirmed positive test result; provide a listing of licensed
  6 23 substance abuse treatment programs available in the area of a
  6 24 person's residence if the person has a confirmed positive test
  6 25 result; and allow for a person who has a confirmed positive
  6 26 test result to reapply one time after six months if the person
  6 27 provides documentation of completing a licensed substance abuse
  6 28 treatment program within six months of the confirmed positive
  6 29 test result and passes another drug test.
  6 30    If a parent is deemed ineligible for assistance as a result
  6 31 of having a confirmed positive test result, the dependent child
  6 32 remains eligible for assistance and a protective payee may be
  6 33 designated by the parent to receive the assistance on behalf of
  6 34 the child.  If a specified relative or other immediate family
  6 35 member declines to be designated, the department must designate
  7  1 the protective payee.  The protective payee is then subject
  7  2 to drug testing before being approved to receive assistance
  7  3 on behalf of the child.  A protective payee with a confirmed
  7  4 positive test result is ineligible to receive assistance on
  7  5 behalf of the child.
  7  6    The department is required to adopt rules to implement the
  7  7 new requirements.

  4 34 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  4 35 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  5  1 This bill requires drug testing of applicants for and
  5  2 certain recipients of assistance under the family investment
  5  3 program (FIP) in new Code section 239B.2D.  The program
  5  4 provides cash assistance and employment=related services to
  5  5 low=income families with children under the federal temporary
  5  6 assistance for needy families (TANF) block grant.  The
  5  7 department of human services administers the program and block
  5  8 grant for this state.
  5  9    The bill utilizes the following terms that are defined in
  5 10 Code section 239B.1:
  5 11    "Applicant" means a person who files an application for
  5 12 participation in FIP under Code chapter 239B.
  5 13    "Assistance" means a FIP payment.

  5 21 opportunities and basic skills program, a part of FIP.
  5 22    "Specified relative" means a person who is, or was at any
  5 23 time, a relative of an applicant or participant child, by means
  5 24 of blood relationship, marriage, or adoption, or is a spouse of
  5 25 a relative listed in the definition.
  5 26    The bill defines "confirmed positive test result", "licensed
  5 27 substance abuse treatment program", and "sample".
  5 28    The drug testing requirement applies to each applicant for
  5 29 FIP assistance who is an adult parent, guardian, or specified
  5 30 relative who is included in the applicant family, including
  5 31 both parents of a two=parent family, or an individual who may
  5 32 be exempt from work activity requirements due to the age of the
  5 33 youngest child or who may be exempt from work activity under
  5 34 the PROMISE JOBS program.  The requirement also applies to
  5 35 each minor parent applicant who is not required to live with
  6  1 a parent, guardian, or other adult caretaker.  In addition,
  6  2 a recipient of assistance who accepted the drug testing
  6  3 requirements at the time of application and for whom there is
  6  4 information indicating a significant likelihood the recipient
  6  5 is using a controlled substance is subject to random drug
  6  6 testing. Dependent children under the age of 18 years are
  6  7 exempt from the drug testing requirements. The department is
  6  8 directed to require a drug test of each person who is subject
  6  9 to the requirements to screen for the presence of controlled
  6 10 substances.  The person is responsible for the cost of the drug
  6 11 test.
  6 12    A person subject to the requirement who does not participate
  6 13 in the required drug testing is ineligible for cash assistance
  6 14 through FIP.  A person who has a confirmed positive test result
  6 15 is ineligible for one year unless the test result was for a
  6 16 controlled substance for which the person has a prescription.
  6 17    The department is required to do all of the following
  6 18 in administering the drug testing requirement:  implement
  6 19 notification provisions; allow for additional testing following
  6 20 a confirmed positive test result; apply a three=year period
  6 21 of ineligibility if a person reapplies but has a subsequent
  6 22 confirmed positive test result; provide a listing of licensed
  6 23 substance abuse treatment programs available in the area of a
  6 24 person's residence if the person has a confirmed positive test
  6 25 result; and allow for a person who has a confirmed positive
  6 26 test result to reapply one time after six months if the person
  6 27 provides documentation of completing a licensed substance abuse
  6 28 treatment program within six months of the confirmed positive
  6 29 test result and passes another drug test.
  6 30    If a parent is deemed ineligible for assistance as a result
  6 31 of having a confirmed positive test result, the dependent child
  6 32 remains eligible for assistance and a protective payee may be
  6 33 designated by the parent to receive the assistance on behalf of
  6 34 the child.  If a specified relative or other immediate family
  6 35 member declines to be designated, the department must designate
  7  1 the protective payee.  The protective payee is then subject
  7  2 to drug testing before being approved to receive assistance
  7  3 on behalf of the child.  A protective payee with a confirmed
  7  4 positive test result is ineligible to receive assistance on
  7  5 behalf of the child.
  7  6    The department is required to adopt rules to implement the
  7  7 new requirements.

  4 34 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  4 35 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  5  1 This bill requires drug testing of applicants for and
  5  2 certain recipients of assistance under the family investment
  5  3 program (FIP) in new Code section 239B.2D.  The program
  5  4 provides cash assistance and employment=related services to
  5  5 low=income families with children under the federal temporary
  5  6 assistance for needy families (TANF) block grant.  The
  5  7 department of human services administers the program and block
  5  8 grant for this state.
  5  9    The bill utilizes the following terms that are defined in
  5 10 Code section 239B.1:
  5 11    "Applicant" means a person who files an application for
  5 12 participation in FIP under Code chapter 239B.
  5 13    "Assistance" means a FIP payment.

  5 19    "PROMISE JOBS program" or "JOBS program" means the promoting
  5 20 independence and self=sufficiency through employment job
  5 21 opportunities and basic skills program, a part of FIP.
  5 22    "Specified relative" means a person who is, or was at any
  5 23 time, a relative of an applicant or participant child, by means
  5 24 of blood relationship, marriage, or adoption, or is a spouse of
  5 25 a relative listed in the definition.
  5 26    The bill defines "confirmed positive test result", "licensed
  5 27 substance abuse treatment program", and "sample".
  5 28    The drug testing requirement applies to each applicant for
  5 29 FIP assistance who is an adult parent, guardian, or specified
  5 30 relative who is included in the applicant family, including
  5 31 both parents of a two=parent family, or an individual who may
  5 32 be exempt from work activity requirements due to the age of the
  5 33 youngest child or who may be exempt from work activity under
  5 34 the PROMISE JOBS program.  The requirement also applies to
  5 35 each minor parent applicant who is not required to live with
  6  1 a parent, guardian, or other adult caretaker.  In addition,
  6  2 a recipient of assistance who accepted the drug testing
  6  3 requirements at the time of application and for whom there is
  6  4 information indicating a significant likelihood the recipient
  6  5 is using a controlled substance is subject to random drug
  6  6 testing. Dependent children under the age of 18 years are
  6  7 exempt from the drug testing requirements. The department is
  6  8 directed to require a drug test of each person who is subject
  6  9 to the requirements to screen for the presence of controlled
  6 10 substances.  The person is responsible for the cost of the drug
  6 11 test.
  6 12    A person subject to the requirement who does not participate
  6 13 in the required drug testing is ineligible for cash assistance
  6 14 through FIP.  A person who has a confirmed positive test result
  6 15 is ineligible for one year unless the test result was for a
  6 16 controlled substance for which the person has a prescription.
  6 17    The department is required to do all of the following
  6 18 in administering the drug testing requirement:  implement
  6 19 notification provisions; allow for additional testing following
  6 20 a confirmed positive test result; apply a three=year period
  6 21 of ineligibility if a person reapplies but has a subsequent
  6 22 confirmed positive test result; provide a listing of licensed
  6 23 substance abuse treatment programs available in the area of a
  6 24 person's residence if the person has a confirmed positive test
  6 25 result; and allow for a person who has a confirmed positive
  6 26 test result to reapply one time after six months if the person
  6 27 provides documentation of completing a licensed substance abuse
  6 28 treatment program within six months of the confirmed positive
  6 29 test result and passes another drug test.
  6 30    If a parent is deemed ineligible for assistance as a result
  6 31 of having a confirmed positive test result, the dependent child
  6 32 remains eligible for assistance and a protective payee may be
  6 33 designated by the parent to receive the assistance on behalf of
  6 34 the child.  If a specified relative or other immediate family
  6 35 member declines to be designated, the department must designate
  7  1 the protective payee.  The protective payee is then subject
  7  2 to drug testing before being approved to receive assistance
  7  3 on behalf of the child.  A protective payee with a confirmed
  7  4 positive test result is ineligible to receive assistance on
  7  5 behalf of the child.
  7  6    The department is required to adopt rules to implement the
  7  7 new requirements.

  4 33                           EXPLANATION
  4 34 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  4 35 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  5  1 This bill requires drug testing of applicants for and
  5  2 certain recipients of assistance under the family investment
  5  3 program (FIP) in new Code section 239B.2D.  The program
  5  4 provides cash assistance and employment=related services to
  5  5 low=income families with children under the federal temporary
  5  6 assistance for needy families (TANF) block grant.  The
  5  7 department of human services administers the program and block
  5  8 grant for this state.
  5  9    The bill utilizes the following terms that are defined in
  5 10 Code section 239B.1:
  5 11    "Applicant" means a person who files an application for
  5 12 participation in FIP under Code chapter 239B.
  5 13    "Assistance" means a FIP payment.
  5 14    "Family" means a family unit that includes at least one

  5 19    "PROMISE JOBS program" or "JOBS program" means the promoting
  5 20 independence and self=sufficiency through employment job
  5 21 opportunities and basic skills program, a part of FIP.
  5 22    "Specified relative" means a person who is, or was at any
  5 23 time, a relative of an applicant or participant child, by means
  5 24 of blood relationship, marriage, or adoption, or is a spouse of
  5 25 a relative listed in the definition.
  5 26    The bill defines "confirmed positive test result", "licensed
  5 27 substance abuse treatment program", and "sample".
  5 28    The drug testing requirement applies to each applicant for
  5 29 FIP assistance who is an adult parent, guardian, or specified
  5 30 relative who is included in the applicant family, including
  5 31 both parents of a two=parent family, or an individual who may
  5 32 be exempt from work activity requirements due to the age of the
  5 33 youngest child or who may be exempt from work activity under
  5 34 the PROMISE JOBS program.  The requirement also applies to
  5 35 each minor parent applicant who is not required to live with
  6  1 a parent, guardian, or other adult caretaker.  In addition,
  6  2 a recipient of assistance who accepted the drug testing
  6  3 requirements at the time of application and for whom there is
  6  4 information indicating a significant likelihood the recipient
  6  5 is using a controlled substance is subject to random drug
  6  6 testing. Dependent children under the age of 18 years are
  6  7 exempt from the drug testing requirements. The department is
  6  8 directed to require a drug test of each person who is subject
  6  9 to the requirements to screen for the presence of controlled
  6 10 substances.  The person is responsible for the cost of the drug
  6 11 test.
  6 12    A person subject to the requirement who does not participate
  6 13 in the required drug testing is ineligible for cash assistance
  6 14 through FIP.  A person who has a confirmed positive test result
  6 15 is ineligible for one year unless the test result was for a
  6 16 controlled substance for which the person has a prescription.
  6 17    The department is required to do all of the following
  6 18 in administering the drug testing requirement:  implement
  6 19 notification provisions; allow for additional testing following
  6 20 a confirmed positive test result; apply a three=year period
  6 21 of ineligibility if a person reapplies but has a subsequent
  6 22 confirmed positive test result; provide a listing of licensed
  6 23 substance abuse treatment programs available in the area of a
  6 24 person's residence if the person has a confirmed positive test
  6 25 result; and allow for a person who has a confirmed positive
  6 26 test result to reapply one time after six months if the person
  6 27 provides documentation of completing a licensed substance abuse
  6 28 treatment program within six months of the confirmed positive
  6 29 test result and passes another drug test.
  6 30    If a parent is deemed ineligible for assistance as a result
  6 31 of having a confirmed positive test result, the dependent child
  6 32 remains eligible for assistance and a protective payee may be
  6 33 designated by the parent to receive the assistance on behalf of
  6 34 the child.  If a specified relative or other immediate family
  6 35 member declines to be designated, the department must designate
  7  1 the protective payee.  The protective payee is then subject
  7  2 to drug testing before being approved to receive assistance
  7  3 on behalf of the child.  A protective payee with a confirmed
  7  4 positive test result is ineligible to receive assistance on
  7  5 behalf of the child.
  7  6    The department is required to adopt rules to implement the
  7  7 new requirements.

  4 34 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  4 35 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  5  1 This bill requires drug testing of applicants for and
  5  2 certain recipients of assistance under the family investment
  5  3 program (FIP) in new Code section 239B.2D.  The program
  5  4 provides cash assistance and employment=related services to
  5  5 low=income families with children under the federal temporary
  5  6 assistance for needy families (TANF) block grant.  The
  5  7 department of human services administers the program and block
  5  8 grant for this state.
  5  9    The bill utilizes the following terms that are defined in
  5 10 Code section 239B.1:
  5 11    "Applicant" means a person who files an application for
  5 12 participation in FIP under Code chapter 239B.
  5 13    "Assistance" means a FIP payment.
  5 14    "Family" means a family unit that includes at least one
  5 15 child and at least one parent or other specified relative of
  5 16 the child.

  5 19    "PROMISE JOBS program" or "JOBS program" means the promoting
  5 20 independence and self=sufficiency through employment job
  5 21 opportunities and basic skills program, a part of FIP.
  5 22    "Specified relative" means a person who is, or was at any
  5 23 time, a relative of an applicant or participant child, by means
  5 24 of blood relationship, marriage, or adoption, or is a spouse of
  5 25 a relative listed in the definition.
  5 26    The bill defines "confirmed positive test result", "licensed
  5 27 substance abuse treatment program", and "sample".
  5 28    The drug testing requirement applies to each applicant for
  5 29 FIP assistance who is an adult parent, guardian, or specified
  5 30 relative who is included in the applicant family, including
  5 31 both parents of a two=parent family, or an individual who may
  5 32 be exempt from work activity requirements due to the age of the
  5 33 youngest child or who may be exempt from work activity under
  5 34 the PROMISE JOBS program.  The requirement also applies to
  5 35 each minor parent applicant who is not required to live with
  6  1 a parent, guardian, or other adult caretaker.  In addition,
  6  2 a recipient of assistance who accepted the drug testing
  6  3 requirements at the time of application and for whom there is
  6  4 information indicating a significant likelihood the recipient
  6  5 is using a controlled substance is subject to random drug
  6  6 testing. Dependent children under the age of 18 years are
  6  7 exempt from the drug testing requirements. The department is
  6  8 directed to require a drug test of each person who is subject
  6  9 to the requirements to screen for the presence of controlled
  6 10 substances.  The person is responsible for the cost of the drug
  6 11 test.
  6 12    A person subject to the requirement who does not participate
  6 13 in the required drug testing is ineligible for cash assistance
  6 14 through FIP.  A person who has a confirmed positive test result
  6 15 is ineligible for one year unless the test result was for a
  6 16 controlled substance for which the person has a prescription.
  6 17    The department is required to do all of the following
  6 18 in administering the drug testing requirement:  implement
  6 19 notification provisions; allow for additional testing following
  6 20 a confirmed positive test result; apply a three=year period
  6 21 of ineligibility if a person reapplies but has a subsequent
  6 22 confirmed positive test result; provide a listing of licensed
  6 23 substance abuse treatment programs available in the area of a
  6 24 person's residence if the person has a confirmed positive test
  6 25 result; and allow for a person who has a confirmed positive
  6 26 test result to reapply one time after six months if the person
  6 27 provides documentation of completing a licensed substance abuse
  6 28 treatment program within six months of the confirmed positive
  6 29 test result and passes another drug test.
  6 30    If a parent is deemed ineligible for assistance as a result
  6 31 of having a confirmed positive test result, the dependent child
  6 32 remains eligible for assistance and a protective payee may be
  6 33 designated by the parent to receive the assistance on behalf of
  6 34 the child.  If a specified relative or other immediate family
  6 35 member declines to be designated, the department must designate
  7  1 the protective payee.  The protective payee is then subject
  7  2 to drug testing before being approved to receive assistance
  7  3 on behalf of the child.  A protective payee with a confirmed
  7  4 positive test result is ineligible to receive assistance on
  7  5 behalf of the child.
  7  6    The department is required to adopt rules to implement the
  7  7 new requirements.

  5  1 This bill requires drug testing of applicants for and
  5  2 certain recipients of assistance under the family investment

  5 12 participation in FIP under Code chapter 239B.
  5 13    "Assistance" means a FIP payment.

  5 23 time, a relative of an applicant or participant child, by means
  5 24 of blood relationship, marriage, or adoption, or is a spouse of
  5 25 a relative listed in the definition.
  5 26    The bill defines "confirmed positive test result", "licensed
  5 27 substance abuse treatment program", and "sample".
  5 28    The drug testing requirement applies to each applicant for
  5 29 FIP assistance who is an adult parent, guardian, or specified
  5 30 relative who is included in the applicant family, including
  5 31 both parents of a two=parent family, or an individual who may
  5 32 be exempt from work activity requirements due to the age of the
  5 33 youngest child or who may be exempt from work activity under
  5 34 the PROMISE JOBS program.  The requirement also applies to
  5 35 each minor parent applicant who is not required to live with
  6  1 a parent, guardian, or other adult caretaker.  In addition,
  6  2 a recipient of assistance who accepted the drug testing
  6  3 requirements at the time of application and for whom there is
  6  4 information indicating a significant likelihood the recipient
  6  5 is using a controlled substance is subject to random drug
  6  6 testing. Dependent children under the age of 18 years are
  6  7 exempt from the drug testing requirements. The department is
  6  8 directed to require a drug test of each person who is subject
  6  9 to the requirements to screen for the presence of controlled
  6 10 substances.  The person is responsible for the cost of the drug
  6 11 test.
  6 12    A person subject to the requirement who does not participate
  6 13 in the required drug testing is ineligible for cash assistance
  6 14 through FIP.  A person who has a confirmed positive test result
  6 15 is ineligible for one year unless the test result was for a
  6 16 controlled substance for which the person has a prescription.
  6 17    The department is required to do all of the following
  6 18 in administering the drug testing requirement:  implement
  6 19 notification provisions; allow for additional testing following
  6 20 a confirmed positive test result; apply a three=year period
  6 21 of ineligibility if a person reapplies but has a subsequent
  6 22 confirmed positive test result; provide a listing of licensed
  6 23 substance abuse treatment programs available in the area of a
  6 24 person's residence if the person has a confirmed positive test
  6 25 result; and allow for a person who has a confirmed positive
  6 26 test result to reapply one time after six months if the person
  6 27 provides documentation of completing a licensed substance abuse
  6 28 treatment program within six months of the confirmed positive
  6 29 test result and passes another drug test.
  6 30    If a parent is deemed ineligible for assistance as a result
  6 31 of having a confirmed positive test result, the dependent child
  6 32 remains eligible for assistance and a protective payee may be
  6 33 designated by the parent to receive the assistance on behalf of
  6 34 the child.  If a specified relative or other immediate family
  6 35 member declines to be designated, the department must designate
  7  1 the protective payee.  The protective payee is then subject
  7  2 to drug testing before being approved to receive assistance
  7  3 on behalf of the child.  A protective payee with a confirmed
  7  4 positive test result is ineligible to receive assistance on
  7  5 behalf of the child.
  7  6    The department is required to adopt rules to implement the
  7  7 new requirements.

  4 34 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  4 35 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  5  1 This bill requires drug testing of applicants for and
  5  2 certain recipients of assistance under the family investment
  5  3 program (FIP) in new Code section 239B.2D.  The program
  5  4 provides cash assistance and employment=related services to
  5  5 low=income families with children under the federal temporary
  5  6 assistance for needy families (TANF) block grant.  The
  5  7 department of human services administers the program and block
  5  8 grant for this state.
  5  9    The bill utilizes the following terms that are defined in
  5 10 Code section 239B.1:
  5 11    "Applicant" means a person who files an application for
  5 12 participation in FIP under Code chapter 239B.
  5 13    "Assistance" means a FIP payment.
  5 14    "Family" means a family unit that includes at least one

  5 21 opportunities and basic skills program, a part of FIP.
  5 22    "Specified relative" means a person who is, or was at any
  5 23 time, a relative of an applicant or participant child, by means
  5 24 of blood relationship, marriage, or adoption, or is a spouse of
  5 25 a relative listed in the definition.
  5 26    The bill defines "confirmed positive test result", "licensed
  5 27 substance abuse treatment program", and "sample".
  5 28    The drug testing requirement applies to each applicant for
  5 29 FIP assistance who is an adult parent, guardian, or specified
  5 30 relative who is included in the applicant family, including
  5 31 both parents of a two=parent family, or an individual who may
  5 32 be exempt from work activity requirements due to the age of the
  5 33 youngest child or who may be exempt from work activity under
  5 34 the PROMISE JOBS program.  The requirement also applies to
  5 35 each minor parent applicant who is not required to live with
  6  1 a parent, guardian, or other adult caretaker.  In addition,
  6  2 a recipient of assistance who accepted the drug testing
  6  3 requirements at the time of application and for whom there is
  6  4 information indicating a significant likelihood the recipient
  6  5 is using a controlled substance is subject to random drug
  6  6 testing. Dependent children under the age of 18 years are
  6  7 exempt from the drug testing requirements. The department is
  6  8 directed to require a drug test of each person who is subject
  6  9 to the requirements to screen for the presence of controlled
  6 10 substances.  The person is responsible for the cost of the drug
  6 11 test.
  6 12    A person subject to the requirement who does not participate
  6 13 in the required drug testing is ineligible for cash assistance
  6 14 through FIP.  A person who has a confirmed positive test result
  6 15 is ineligible for one year unless the test result was for a
  6 16 controlled substance for which the person has a prescription.
  6 17    The department is required to do all of the following
  6 18 in administering the drug testing requirement:  implement
  6 19 notification provisions; allow for additional testing following
  6 20 a confirmed positive test result; apply a three=year period
  6 21 of ineligibility if a person reapplies but has a subsequent
  6 22 confirmed positive test result; provide a listing of licensed
  6 23 substance abuse treatment programs available in the area of a
  6 24 person's residence if the person has a confirmed positive test
  6 25 result; and allow for a person who has a confirmed positive
  6 26 test result to reapply one time after six months if the person
  6 27 provides documentation of completing a licensed substance abuse
  6 28 treatment program within six months of the confirmed positive
  6 29 test result and passes another drug test.
  6 30    If a parent is deemed ineligible for assistance as a result
  6 31 of having a confirmed positive test result, the dependent child
  6 32 remains eligible for assistance and a protective payee may be
  6 33 designated by the parent to receive the assistance on behalf of
  6 34 the child.  If a specified relative or other immediate family
  6 35 member declines to be designated, the department must designate
  7  1 the protective payee.  The protective payee is then subject
  7  2 to drug testing before being approved to receive assistance
  7  3 on behalf of the child.  A protective payee with a confirmed
  7  4 positive test result is ineligible to receive assistance on
  7  5 behalf of the child.
  7  6    The department is required to adopt rules to implement the
  7  7 new requirements.

  5 28    The drug testing requirement applies to each applicant for
  5 29 FIP assistance who is an adult parent, guardian, or specified
  5 30 relative who is included in the applicant family, including
  5 31 both parents of a two=parent family, or an individual who may
  5 32 be exempt from work activity requirements due to the age of the

  6 14 through FIP.  A person who has a confirmed positive test result
  6 15 is ineligible for one year unless the test result was for a

  6 19 notification provisions; allow for additional testing following
  6 20 a confirmed positive test result; apply a three=year period

  6 22 confirmed positive test result; provide a listing of licensed
  6 23 substance abuse treatment programs available in the area of a
  6 24 person's residence if the person has a confirmed positive test
  6 25 result; and allow for a person who has a confirmed positive
  6 26 test result to reapply one time after six months if the person
  6 27 provides documentation of completing a licensed substance abuse
  6 28 treatment program within six months of the confirmed positive
  6 29 test result and passes another drug test.
  6 30    If a parent is deemed ineligible for assistance as a result
  6 31 of having a confirmed positive test result, the dependent child
  6 32 remains eligible for assistance and a protective payee may be
  6 33 designated by the parent to receive the assistance on behalf of
  6 34 the child.  If a specified relative or other immediate family
  6 35 member declines to be designated, the department must designate
  7  1 the protective payee.  The protective payee is then subject
  7  2 to drug testing before being approved to receive assistance
  7  3 on behalf of the child.  A protective payee with a confirmed
  7  4 positive test result is ineligible to receive assistance on
  7  5 behalf of the child.
  7  6    The department is required to adopt rules to implement the

  5 23 time, a relative of an applicant or participant child, by means
  5 24 of blood relationship, marriage, or adoption, or is a spouse of
  5 25 a relative listed in the definition.
  5 26    The bill defines "confirmed positive test result", "licensed
  5 27 substance abuse treatment program", and "sample".
  5 28    The drug testing requirement applies to each applicant for
  5 29 FIP assistance who is an adult parent, guardian, or specified
  5 30 relative who is included in the applicant family, including
  5 31 both parents of a two=parent family, or an individual who may
  5 32 be exempt from work activity requirements due to the age of the
  5 33 youngest child or who may be exempt from work activity under
  5 34 the PROMISE JOBS program.  The requirement also applies to
  5 35 each minor parent applicant who is not required to live with
  6  1 a parent, guardian, or other adult caretaker.  In addition,
  6  2 a recipient of assistance who accepted the drug testing
  6  3 requirements at the time of application and for whom there is
  6  4 information indicating a significant likelihood the recipient
  6  5 is using a controlled substance is subject to random drug
  6  6 testing. Dependent children under the age of 18 years are
  6  7 exempt from the drug testing requirements. The department is
  6  8 directed to require a drug test of each person who is subject
  6  9 to the requirements to screen for the presence of controlled
  6 10 substances.  The person is responsible for the cost of the drug
  6 11 test.
  6 12    A person subject to the requirement who does not participate
  6 13 in the required drug testing is ineligible for cash assistance
  6 14 through FIP.  A person who has a confirmed positive test result
  6 15 is ineligible for one year unless the test result was for a
  6 16 controlled substance for which the person has a prescription.
  6 17    The department is required to do all of the following
  6 18 in administering the drug testing requirement:  implement
  6 19 notification provisions; allow for additional testing following
  6 20 a confirmed positive test result; apply a three=year period
  6 21 of ineligibility if a person reapplies but has a subsequent
  6 22 confirmed positive test result; provide a listing of licensed
  6 23 substance abuse treatment programs available in the area of a
  6 24 person's residence if the person has a confirmed positive test
  6 25 result; and allow for a person who has a confirmed positive
  6 26 test result to reapply one time after six months if the person
  6 27 provides documentation of completing a licensed substance abuse
  6 28 treatment program within six months of the confirmed positive
  6 29 test result and passes another drug test.
  6 30    If a parent is deemed ineligible for assistance as a result
  6 31 of having a confirmed positive test result, the dependent child
  6 32 remains eligible for assistance and a protective payee may be
  6 33 designated by the parent to receive the assistance on behalf of
  6 34 the child.  If a specified relative or other immediate family
  6 35 member declines to be designated, the department must designate
  7  1 the protective payee.  The protective payee is then subject
  7  2 to drug testing before being approved to receive assistance
  7  3 on behalf of the child.  A protective payee with a confirmed
  7  4 positive test result is ineligible to receive assistance on
  7  5 behalf of the child.
  7  6    The department is required to adopt rules to implement the
  7  7 new requirements.

  6 14 through FIP.  A person who has a confirmed positive test result
  6 15 is ineligible for one year unless the test result was for a
  6 16 controlled substance for which the person has a prescription.
  6 17    The department is required to do all of the following
  6 18 in administering the drug testing requirement:  implement
  6 19 notification provisions; allow for additional testing following
  6 20 a confirmed positive test result; apply a three=year period
  6 21 of ineligibility if a person reapplies but has a subsequent
  6 22 confirmed positive test result; provide a listing of licensed
  6 23 substance abuse treatment programs available in the area of a
  6 24 person's residence if the person has a confirmed positive test
  6 25 result; and allow for a person who has a confirmed positive
  6 26 test result to reapply one time after six months if the person
  6 27 provides documentation of completing a licensed substance abuse
  6 28 treatment program within six months of the confirmed positive
  6 29 test result and passes another drug test.
  6 30    If a parent is deemed ineligible for assistance as a result
  6 31 of having a confirmed positive test result, the dependent child
  6 32 remains eligible for assistance and a protective payee may be
  6 33 designated by the parent to receive the assistance on behalf of
  6 34 the child.  If a specified relative or other immediate family
  6 35 member declines to be designated, the department must designate
  7  1 the protective payee.  The protective payee is then subject
  7  2 to drug testing before being approved to receive assistance
  7  3 on behalf of the child.  A protective payee with a confirmed
  7  4 positive test result is ineligible to receive assistance on
  7  5 behalf of the child.
  7  6    The department is required to adopt rules to implement the
  7  7 new requirements.

  5 28    The drug testing requirement applies to each applicant for
  5 29 FIP assistance who is an adult parent, guardian, or specified
  5 30 relative who is included in the applicant family, including
  5 31 both parents of a two=parent family, or an individual who may
  5 32 be exempt from work activity requirements due to the age of the
  5 33 youngest child or who may be exempt from work activity under
  5 34 the PROMISE JOBS program.  The requirement also applies to
  5 35 each minor parent applicant who is not required to live with
  6  1 a parent, guardian, or other adult caretaker.  In addition,

  6 11 test.
  6 12    A person subject to the requirement who does not participate

  6 14 through FIP.  A person who has a confirmed positive test result
  6 15 is ineligible for one year unless the test result was for a
  6 16 controlled substance for which the person has a prescription.

  6 19 notification provisions; allow for additional testing following
  6 20 a confirmed positive test result; apply a three=year period

  6 25 result; and allow for a person who has a confirmed positive
  6 26 test result to reapply one time after six months if the person
  6 27 provides documentation of completing a licensed substance abuse
  6 28 treatment program within six months of the confirmed positive
  6 29 test result and passes another drug test.
  6 30    If a parent is deemed ineligible for assistance as a result
  6 31 of having a confirmed positive test result, the dependent child
  6 32 remains eligible for assistance and a protective payee may be
  6 33 designated by the parent to receive the assistance on behalf of
  6 34 the child.  If a specified relative or other immediate family
  6 35 member declines to be designated, the department must designate
  7  1 the protective payee.  The protective payee is then subject
  7  2 to drug testing before being approved to receive assistance
  7  3 on behalf of the child.  A protective payee with a confirmed
  7  4 positive test result is ineligible to receive assistance on
  7  5 behalf of the child.
  7  6    The department is required to adopt rules to implement the
  7  7 new requirements.

  4 24 available or the family member declines the designation. In
  4 25 which case another individual, approved by the department,
  4 26 shall be designated as the protective payee. The individual
  4 27 must also undergo drug testing before being approved to be
  4 28 the protective payee. If the designated individual has a
  4 29 confirmed positive test result, the designated individual shall
  4 30 be ineligible to be the protective payee.

  4 32 section.
  4 33                           EXPLANATION
  4 34 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  4 35 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  5  1 This bill requires drug testing of applicants for and
  5  2 certain recipients of assistance under the family investment
  5  3 program (FIP) in new Code section 239B.2D.  The program
  5  4 provides cash assistance and employment=related services to
  5  5 low=income families with children under the federal temporary
  5  6 assistance for needy families (TANF) block grant.  The
  5  7 department of human services administers the program and block
  5  8 grant for this state.
  5  9    The bill utilizes the following terms that are defined in
  5 10 Code section 239B.1:
  5 11    "Applicant" means a person who files an application for
  5 12 participation in FIP under Code chapter 239B.
  5 13    "Assistance" means a FIP payment.
  5 14    "Family" means a family unit that includes at least one
  5 15 child and at least one parent or other specified relative of
  5 16 the child.
  5 17    "Minor parent" means an applicant or participant parent who
  5 18 is less than 18 years of age and has never been married.
  5 19    "PROMISE JOBS program" or "JOBS program" means the promoting
  5 20 independence and self=sufficiency through employment job
  5 21 opportunities and basic skills program, a part of FIP.
  5 22    "Specified relative" means a person who is, or was at any
  5 23 time, a relative of an applicant or participant child, by means
  5 24 of blood relationship, marriage, or adoption, or is a spouse of
  5 25 a relative listed in the definition.
  5 26    The bill defines "confirmed positive test result", "licensed
  5 27 substance abuse treatment program", and "sample".
  5 28    The drug testing requirement applies to each applicant for
  5 29 FIP assistance who is an adult parent, guardian, or specified
  5 30 relative who is included in the applicant family, including
  5 31 both parents of a two=parent family, or an individual who may
  5 32 be exempt from work activity requirements due to the age of the
  5 33 youngest child or who may be exempt from work activity under
  5 34 the PROMISE JOBS program.  The requirement also applies to
  5 35 each minor parent applicant who is not required to live with
  6  1 a parent, guardian, or other adult caretaker.  In addition,
  6  2 a recipient of assistance who accepted the drug testing
  6  3 requirements at the time of application and for whom there is
  6  4 information indicating a significant likelihood the recipient
  6  5 is using a controlled substance is subject to random drug
  6  6 testing. Dependent children under the age of 18 years are
  6  7 exempt from the drug testing requirements. The department is
  6  8 directed to require a drug test of each person who is subject
  6  9 to the requirements to screen for the presence of controlled
  6 10 substances.  The person is responsible for the cost of the drug
  6 11 test.
  6 12    A person subject to the requirement who does not participate
  6 13 in the required drug testing is ineligible for cash assistance
  6 14 through FIP.  A person who has a confirmed positive test result
  6 15 is ineligible for one year unless the test result was for a
  6 16 controlled substance for which the person has a prescription.
  6 17    The department is required to do all of the following
  6 18 in administering the drug testing requirement:  implement
  6 19 notification provisions; allow for additional testing following
  6 20 a confirmed positive test result; apply a three=year period
  6 21 of ineligibility if a person reapplies but has a subsequent
  6 22 confirmed positive test result; provide a listing of licensed
  6 23 substance abuse treatment programs available in the area of a
  6 24 person's residence if the person has a confirmed positive test
  6 25 result; and allow for a person who has a confirmed positive
  6 26 test result to reapply one time after six months if the person
  6 27 provides documentation of completing a licensed substance abuse
  6 28 treatment program within six months of the confirmed positive
  6 29 test result and passes another drug test.
  6 30    If a parent is deemed ineligible for assistance as a result
  6 31 of having a confirmed positive test result, the dependent child
  6 32 remains eligible for assistance and a protective payee may be
  6 33 designated by the parent to receive the assistance on behalf of
  6 34 the child.  If a specified relative or other immediate family
  6 35 member declines to be designated, the department must designate
  7  1 the protective payee.  The protective payee is then subject
  7  2 to drug testing before being approved to receive assistance
  7  3 on behalf of the child.  A protective payee with a confirmed
  7  4 positive test result is ineligible to receive assistance on
  7  5 behalf of the child.
  7  6    The department is required to adopt rules to implement the
  7  7 new requirements.

  4 34 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  4 35 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  5  1 This bill requires drug testing of applicants for and
  5  2 certain recipients of assistance under the family investment
  5  3 program (FIP) in new Code section 239B.2D.  The program
  5  4 provides cash assistance and employment=related services to
  5  5 low=income families with children under the federal temporary
  5  6 assistance for needy families (TANF) block grant.  The
  5  7 department of human services administers the program and block
  5  8 grant for this state.
  5  9    The bill utilizes the following terms that are defined in
  5 10 Code section 239B.1:
  5 11    "Applicant" means a person who files an application for
  5 12 participation in FIP under Code chapter 239B.
  5 13    "Assistance" means a FIP payment.
  5 14    "Family" means a family unit that includes at least one
  5 15 child and at least one parent or other specified relative of
  5 16 the child.
  5 17    "Minor parent" means an applicant or participant parent who
  5 18 is less than 18 years of age and has never been married.
  5 19    "PROMISE JOBS program" or "JOBS program" means the promoting
  5 20 independence and self=sufficiency through employment job
  5 21 opportunities and basic skills program, a part of FIP.
  5 22    "Specified relative" means a person who is, or was at any
  5 23 time, a relative of an applicant or participant child, by means
  5 24 of blood relationship, marriage, or adoption, or is a spouse of
  5 25 a relative listed in the definition.
  5 26    The bill defines "confirmed positive test result", "licensed
  5 27 substance abuse treatment program", and "sample".
  5 28    The drug testing requirement applies to each applicant for
  5 29 FIP assistance who is an adult parent, guardian, or specified
  5 30 relative who is included in the applicant family, including
  5 31 both parents of a two=parent family, or an individual who may
  5 32 be exempt from work activity requirements due to the age of the
  5 33 youngest child or who may be exempt from work activity under
  5 34 the PROMISE JOBS program.  The requirement also applies to
  5 35 each minor parent applicant who is not required to live with
  6  1 a parent, guardian, or other adult caretaker.  In addition,
  6  2 a recipient of assistance who accepted the drug testing
  6  3 requirements at the time of application and for whom there is
  6  4 information indicating a significant likelihood the recipient
  6  5 is using a controlled substance is subject to random drug
  6  6 testing. Dependent children under the age of 18 years are
  6  7 exempt from the drug testing requirements. The department is
  6  8 directed to require a drug test of each person who is subject
  6  9 to the requirements to screen for the presence of controlled
  6 10 substances.  The person is responsible for the cost of the drug
  6 11 test.
  6 12    A person subject to the requirement who does not participate
  6 13 in the required drug testing is ineligible for cash assistance
  6 14 through FIP.  A person who has a confirmed positive test result
  6 15 is ineligible for one year unless the test result was for a
  6 16 controlled substance for which the person has a prescription.
  6 17    The department is required to do all of the following
  6 18 in administering the drug testing requirement:  implement
  6 19 notification provisions; allow for additional testing following
  6 20 a confirmed positive test result; apply a three=year period
  6 21 of ineligibility if a person reapplies but has a subsequent
  6 22 confirmed positive test result; provide a listing of licensed
  6 23 substance abuse treatment programs available in the area of a
  6 24 person's residence if the person has a confirmed positive test
  6 25 result; and allow for a person who has a confirmed positive
  6 26 test result to reapply one time after six months if the person
  6 27 provides documentation of completing a licensed substance abuse
  6 28 treatment program within six months of the confirmed positive
  6 29 test result and passes another drug test.
  6 30    If a parent is deemed ineligible for assistance as a result
  6 31 of having a confirmed positive test result, the dependent child
  6 32 remains eligible for assistance and a protective payee may be
  6 33 designated by the parent to receive the assistance on behalf of
  6 34 the child.  If a specified relative or other immediate family
  6 35 member declines to be designated, the department must designate
  7  1 the protective payee.  The protective payee is then subject
  7  2 to drug testing before being approved to receive assistance
  7  3 on behalf of the child.  A protective payee with a confirmed
  7  4 positive test result is ineligible to receive assistance on
  7  5 behalf of the child.
  7  6    The department is required to adopt rules to implement the
  7  7 new requirements.

  4 34 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  4 35 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  5  1 This bill requires drug testing of applicants for and
  5  2 certain recipients of assistance under the family investment
  5  3 program (FIP) in new Code section 239B.2D.  The program
  5  4 provides cash assistance and employment=related services to
  5  5 low=income families with children under the federal temporary
  5  6 assistance for needy families (TANF) block grant.  The
  5  7 department of human services administers the program and block
  5  8 grant for this state.
  5  9    The bill utilizes the following terms that are defined in
  5 10 Code section 239B.1:
  5 11    "Applicant" means a person who files an application for
  5 12 participation in FIP under Code chapter 239B.
  5 13    "Assistance" means a FIP payment.
  5 14    "Family" means a family unit that includes at least one
  5 15 child and at least one parent or other specified relative of
  5 16 the child.

  5 21 opportunities and basic skills program, a part of FIP.
  5 22    "Specified relative" means a person who is, or was at any
  5 23 time, a relative of an applicant or participant child, by means
  5 24 of blood relationship, marriage, or adoption, or is a spouse of
  5 25 a relative listed in the definition.
  5 26    The bill defines "confirmed positive test result", "licensed
  5 27 substance abuse treatment program", and "sample".
  5 28    The drug testing requirement applies to each applicant for
  5 29 FIP assistance who is an adult parent, guardian, or specified
  5 30 relative who is included in the applicant family, including
  5 31 both parents of a two=parent family, or an individual who may
  5 32 be exempt from work activity requirements due to the age of the
  5 33 youngest child or who may be exempt from work activity under
  5 34 the PROMISE JOBS program.  The requirement also applies to
  5 35 each minor parent applicant who is not required to live with
  6  1 a parent, guardian, or other adult caretaker.  In addition,

  6 11 test.
  6 12    A person subject to the requirement who does not participate
  6 13 in the required drug testing is ineligible for cash assistance
  6 14 through FIP.  A person who has a confirmed positive test result
  6 15 is ineligible for one year unless the test result was for a
  6 16 controlled substance for which the person has a prescription.
  6 17    The department is required to do all of the following
  6 18 in administering the drug testing requirement:  implement
  6 19 notification provisions; allow for additional testing following
  6 20 a confirmed positive test result; apply a three=year period
  6 21 of ineligibility if a person reapplies but has a subsequent
  6 22 confirmed positive test result; provide a listing of licensed
  6 23 substance abuse treatment programs available in the area of a
  6 24 person's residence if the person has a confirmed positive test
  6 25 result; and allow for a person who has a confirmed positive
  6 26 test result to reapply one time after six months if the person
  6 27 provides documentation of completing a licensed substance abuse
  6 28 treatment program within six months of the confirmed positive
  6 29 test result and passes another drug test.
  6 30    If a parent is deemed ineligible for assistance as a result
  6 31 of having a confirmed positive test result, the dependent child
  6 32 remains eligible for assistance and a protective payee may be
  6 33 designated by the parent to receive the assistance on behalf of
  6 34 the child.  If a specified relative or other immediate family
  6 35 member declines to be designated, the department must designate
  7  1 the protective payee.  The protective payee is then subject
  7  2 to drug testing before being approved to receive assistance
  7  3 on behalf of the child.  A protective payee with a confirmed
  7  4 positive test result is ineligible to receive assistance on
  7  5 behalf of the child.

  3 21 requirements of paragraph "f". If the person has a subsequent
  3 22 confirmed positive test result, the person shall be ineligible

  3 25 paragraph "f".
  3 26    e.  Provide any person with a confirmed positive test result

  4 24 available or the family member declines the designation. In
  4 25 which case another individual, approved by the department,
  4 26 shall be designated as the protective payee. The individual
  4 27 must also undergo drug testing before being approved to be
  4 28 the protective payee. If the designated individual has a
  4 29 confirmed positive test result, the designated individual shall
  4 30 be ineligible to be the protective payee.
  4 31    6.  The department shall adopt rules to implement this
  4 32 section.
  4 33                           EXPLANATION
  4 34 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  4 35 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  5  1 This bill requires drug testing of applicants for and
  5  2 certain recipients of assistance under the family investment
  5  3 program (FIP) in new Code section 239B.2D.  The program
  5  4 provides cash assistance and employment=related services to
  5  5 low=income families with children under the federal temporary
  5  6 assistance for needy families (TANF) block grant.  The
  5  7 department of human services administers the program and block
  5  8 grant for this state.
  5  9    The bill utilizes the following terms that are defined in
  5 10 Code section 239B.1:
  5 11    "Applicant" means a person who files an application for
  5 12 participation in FIP under Code chapter 239B.
  5 13    "Assistance" means a FIP payment.
  5 14    "Family" means a family unit that includes at least one
  5 15 child and at least one parent or other specified relative of
  5 16 the child.
  5 17    "Minor parent" means an applicant or participant parent who
  5 18 is less than 18 years of age and has never been married.
  5 19    "PROMISE JOBS program" or "JOBS program" means the promoting
  5 20 independence and self=sufficiency through employment job
  5 21 opportunities and basic skills program, a part of FIP.
  5 22    "Specified relative" means a person who is, or was at any
  5 23 time, a relative of an applicant or participant child, by means
  5 24 of blood relationship, marriage, or adoption, or is a spouse of
  5 25 a relative listed in the definition.
  5 26    The bill defines "confirmed positive test result", "licensed
  5 27 substance abuse treatment program", and "sample".
  5 28    The drug testing requirement applies to each applicant for
  5 29 FIP assistance who is an adult parent, guardian, or specified
  5 30 relative who is included in the applicant family, including
  5 31 both parents of a two=parent family, or an individual who may
  5 32 be exempt from work activity requirements due to the age of the
  5 33 youngest child or who may be exempt from work activity under
  5 34 the PROMISE JOBS program.  The requirement also applies to
  5 35 each minor parent applicant who is not required to live with
  6  1 a parent, guardian, or other adult caretaker.  In addition,
  6  2 a recipient of assistance who accepted the drug testing
  6  3 requirements at the time of application and for whom there is
  6  4 information indicating a significant likelihood the recipient
  6  5 is using a controlled substance is subject to random drug
  6  6 testing. Dependent children under the age of 18 years are
  6  7 exempt from the drug testing requirements. The department is
  6  8 directed to require a drug test of each person who is subject
  6  9 to the requirements to screen for the presence of controlled
  6 10 substances.  The person is responsible for the cost of the drug
  6 11 test.
  6 12    A person subject to the requirement who does not participate
  6 13 in the required drug testing is ineligible for cash assistance
  6 14 through FIP.  A person who has a confirmed positive test result
  6 15 is ineligible for one year unless the test result was for a
  6 16 controlled substance for which the person has a prescription.
  6 17    The department is required to do all of the following
  6 18 in administering the drug testing requirement:  implement
  6 19 notification provisions; allow for additional testing following
  6 20 a confirmed positive test result; apply a three=year period
  6 21 of ineligibility if a person reapplies but has a subsequent
  6 22 confirmed positive test result; provide a listing of licensed
  6 23 substance abuse treatment programs available in the area of a
  6 24 person's residence if the person has a confirmed positive test
  6 25 result; and allow for a person who has a confirmed positive
  6 26 test result to reapply one time after six months if the person
  6 27 provides documentation of completing a licensed substance abuse
  6 28 treatment program within six months of the confirmed positive
  6 29 test result and passes another drug test.
  6 30    If a parent is deemed ineligible for assistance as a result
  6 31 of having a confirmed positive test result, the dependent child
  6 32 remains eligible for assistance and a protective payee may be
  6 33 designated by the parent to receive the assistance on behalf of
  6 34 the child.  If a specified relative or other immediate family
  6 35 member declines to be designated, the department must designate
  7  1 the protective payee.  The protective payee is then subject
  7  2 to drug testing before being approved to receive assistance
  7  3 on behalf of the child.  A protective payee with a confirmed
  7  4 positive test result is ineligible to receive assistance on
  7  5 behalf of the child.
  7  6    The department is required to adopt rules to implement the
  7  7 new requirements.

  5  1 This bill requires drug testing of applicants for and
  5  2 certain recipients of assistance under the family investment

  5 30 relative who is included in the applicant family, including
  5 31 both parents of a two=parent family, or an individual who may
  5 32 be exempt from work activity requirements due to the age of the

  6 34 the child.  If a specified relative or other immediate family
  6 35 member declines to be designated, the department must designate
  7  1 the protective payee.  The protective payee is then subject
  7  2 to drug testing before being approved to receive assistance

  4 34 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  4 35 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  5  1 This bill requires drug testing of applicants for and
  5  2 certain recipients of assistance under the family investment
  5  3 program (FIP) in new Code section 239B.2D.  The program
  5  4 provides cash assistance and employment=related services to
  5  5 low=income families with children under the federal temporary
  5  6 assistance for needy families (TANF) block grant.  The
  5  7 department of human services administers the program and block
  5  8 grant for this state.
  5  9    The bill utilizes the following terms that are defined in
  5 10 Code section 239B.1:
  5 11    "Applicant" means a person who files an application for
  5 12 participation in FIP under Code chapter 239B.
  5 13    "Assistance" means a FIP payment.
  5 14    "Family" means a family unit that includes at least one
  5 15 child and at least one parent or other specified relative of
  5 16 the child.
  5 17    "Minor parent" means an applicant or participant parent who
  5 18 is less than 18 years of age and has never been married.
  5 19    "PROMISE JOBS program" or "JOBS program" means the promoting
  5 20 independence and self=sufficiency through employment job
  5 21 opportunities and basic skills program, a part of FIP.
  5 22    "Specified relative" means a person who is, or was at any
  5 23 time, a relative of an applicant or participant child, by means
  5 24 of blood relationship, marriage, or adoption, or is a spouse of
  5 25 a relative listed in the definition.
  5 26    The bill defines "confirmed positive test result", "licensed
  5 27 substance abuse treatment program", and "sample".
  5 28    The drug testing requirement applies to each applicant for
  5 29 FIP assistance who is an adult parent, guardian, or specified
  5 30 relative who is included in the applicant family, including
  5 31 both parents of a two=parent family, or an individual who may
  5 32 be exempt from work activity requirements due to the age of the
  5 33 youngest child or who may be exempt from work activity under
  5 34 the PROMISE JOBS program.  The requirement also applies to
  5 35 each minor parent applicant who is not required to live with
  6  1 a parent, guardian, or other adult caretaker.  In addition,
  6  2 a recipient of assistance who accepted the drug testing
  6  3 requirements at the time of application and for whom there is
  6  4 information indicating a significant likelihood the recipient
  6  5 is using a controlled substance is subject to random drug
  6  6 testing. Dependent children under the age of 18 years are
  6  7 exempt from the drug testing requirements. The department is
  6  8 directed to require a drug test of each person who is subject
  6  9 to the requirements to screen for the presence of controlled
  6 10 substances.  The person is responsible for the cost of the drug
  6 11 test.
  6 12    A person subject to the requirement who does not participate
  6 13 in the required drug testing is ineligible for cash assistance
  6 14 through FIP.  A person who has a confirmed positive test result
  6 15 is ineligible for one year unless the test result was for a
  6 16 controlled substance for which the person has a prescription.
  6 17    The department is required to do all of the following
  6 18 in administering the drug testing requirement:  implement
  6 19 notification provisions; allow for additional testing following
  6 20 a confirmed positive test result; apply a three=year period
  6 21 of ineligibility if a person reapplies but has a subsequent
  6 22 confirmed positive test result; provide a listing of licensed
  6 23 substance abuse treatment programs available in the area of a
  6 24 person's residence if the person has a confirmed positive test
  6 25 result; and allow for a person who has a confirmed positive
  6 26 test result to reapply one time after six months if the person
  6 27 provides documentation of completing a licensed substance abuse
  6 28 treatment program within six months of the confirmed positive
  6 29 test result and passes another drug test.
  6 30    If a parent is deemed ineligible for assistance as a result
  6 31 of having a confirmed positive test result, the dependent child
  6 32 remains eligible for assistance and a protective payee may be
  6 33 designated by the parent to receive the assistance on behalf of
  6 34 the child.  If a specified relative or other immediate family
  6 35 member declines to be designated, the department must designate
  7  1 the protective payee.  The protective payee is then subject
  7  2 to drug testing before being approved to receive assistance
  7  3 on behalf of the child.  A protective payee with a confirmed
  7  4 positive test result is ineligible to receive assistance on
  7  5 behalf of the child.
  7  6    The department is required to adopt rules to implement the
  7  7 new requirements.

  5  1 This bill requires drug testing of applicants for and
  5  2 certain recipients of assistance under the family investment
  5  3 program (FIP) in new Code section 239B.2D.  The program
  5  4 provides cash assistance and employment=related services to
  5  5 low=income families with children under the federal temporary
  5  6 assistance for needy families (TANF) block grant.  The
  5  7 department of human services administers the program and block
  5  8 grant for this state.

  5 10 Code section 239B.1:
  5 11    "Applicant" means a person who files an application for
  5 12 participation in FIP under Code chapter 239B.

  5 28    The drug testing requirement applies to each applicant for
  5 29 FIP assistance who is an adult parent, guardian, or specified
  5 30 relative who is included in the applicant family, including
  5 31 both parents of a two=parent family, or an individual who may
  5 32 be exempt from work activity requirements due to the age of the
  5 33 youngest child or who may be exempt from work activity under
  5 34 the PROMISE JOBS program.  The requirement also applies to

  6 11 test.
  6 12    A person subject to the requirement who does not participate
  6 13 in the required drug testing is ineligible for cash assistance
  6 14 through FIP.  A person who has a confirmed positive test result
  6 15 is ineligible for one year unless the test result was for a
  6 16 controlled substance for which the person has a prescription.
  6 17    The department is required to do all of the following
  6 18 in administering the drug testing requirement:  implement
  6 19 notification provisions; allow for additional testing following
  6 20 a confirmed positive test result; apply a three=year period
  6 21 of ineligibility if a person reapplies but has a subsequent
  6 22 confirmed positive test result; provide a listing of licensed

  6 24 person's residence if the person has a confirmed positive test
  6 25 result; and allow for a person who has a confirmed positive
  6 26 test result to reapply one time after six months if the person
  6 27 provides documentation of completing a licensed substance abuse
  6 28 treatment program within six months of the confirmed positive
  6 29 test result and passes another drug test.
  6 30    If a parent is deemed ineligible for assistance as a result
  6 31 of having a confirmed positive test result, the dependent child
  6 32 remains eligible for assistance and a protective payee may be
  6 33 designated by the parent to receive the assistance on behalf of
  6 34 the child.  If a specified relative or other immediate family
  6 35 member declines to be designated, the department must designate
  7  1 the protective payee.  The protective payee is then subject
  7  2 to drug testing before being approved to receive assistance
  7  3 on behalf of the child.  A protective payee with a confirmed
  7  4 positive test result is ineligible to receive assistance on
  7  5 behalf of the child.
  7  6    The department is required to adopt rules to implement the
  7  7 new requirements.

  4 33                           EXPLANATION
  4 34 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  4 35 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  5  1 This bill requires drug testing of applicants for and
  5  2 certain recipients of assistance under the family investment
  5  3 program (FIP) in new Code section 239B.2D.  The program
  5  4 provides cash assistance and employment=related services to
  5  5 low=income families with children under the federal temporary
  5  6 assistance for needy families (TANF) block grant.  The
  5  7 department of human services administers the program and block
  5  8 grant for this state.
  5  9    The bill utilizes the following terms that are defined in
  5 10 Code section 239B.1:
  5 11    "Applicant" means a person who files an application for
  5 12 participation in FIP under Code chapter 239B.
  5 13    "Assistance" means a FIP payment.
  5 14    "Family" means a family unit that includes at least one
  5 15 child and at least one parent or other specified relative of
  5 16 the child.
  5 17    "Minor parent" means an applicant or participant parent who
  5 18 is less than 18 years of age and has never been married.
  5 19    "PROMISE JOBS program" or "JOBS program" means the promoting
  5 20 independence and self=sufficiency through employment job
  5 21 opportunities and basic skills program, a part of FIP.
  5 22    "Specified relative" means a person who is, or was at any
  5 23 time, a relative of an applicant or participant child, by means
  5 24 of blood relationship, marriage, or adoption, or is a spouse of
  5 25 a relative listed in the definition.
  5 26    The bill defines "confirmed positive test result", "licensed
  5 27 substance abuse treatment program", and "sample".
  5 28    The drug testing requirement applies to each applicant for
  5 29 FIP assistance who is an adult parent, guardian, or specified
  5 30 relative who is included in the applicant family, including
  5 31 both parents of a two=parent family, or an individual who may
  5 32 be exempt from work activity requirements due to the age of the
  5 33 youngest child or who may be exempt from work activity under
  5 34 the PROMISE JOBS program.  The requirement also applies to
  5 35 each minor parent applicant who is not required to live with
  6  1 a parent, guardian, or other adult caretaker.  In addition,
  6  2 a recipient of assistance who accepted the drug testing
  6  3 requirements at the time of application and for whom there is
  6  4 information indicating a significant likelihood the recipient
  6  5 is using a controlled substance is subject to random drug
  6  6 testing. Dependent children under the age of 18 years are
  6  7 exempt from the drug testing requirements. The department is
  6  8 directed to require a drug test of each person who is subject
  6  9 to the requirements to screen for the presence of controlled
  6 10 substances.  The person is responsible for the cost of the drug
  6 11 test.
  6 12    A person subject to the requirement who does not participate
  6 13 in the required drug testing is ineligible for cash assistance
  6 14 through FIP.  A person who has a confirmed positive test result
  6 15 is ineligible for one year unless the test result was for a
  6 16 controlled substance for which the person has a prescription.
  6 17    The department is required to do all of the following
  6 18 in administering the drug testing requirement:  implement
  6 19 notification provisions; allow for additional testing following
  6 20 a confirmed positive test result; apply a three=year period
  6 21 of ineligibility if a person reapplies but has a subsequent
  6 22 confirmed positive test result; provide a listing of licensed
  6 23 substance abuse treatment programs available in the area of a
  6 24 person's residence if the person has a confirmed positive test
  6 25 result; and allow for a person who has a confirmed positive
  6 26 test result to reapply one time after six months if the person
  6 27 provides documentation of completing a licensed substance abuse
  6 28 treatment program within six months of the confirmed positive
  6 29 test result and passes another drug test.
  6 30    If a parent is deemed ineligible for assistance as a result
  6 31 of having a confirmed positive test result, the dependent child
  6 32 remains eligible for assistance and a protective payee may be
  6 33 designated by the parent to receive the assistance on behalf of
  6 34 the child.  If a specified relative or other immediate family
  6 35 member declines to be designated, the department must designate
  7  1 the protective payee.  The protective payee is then subject
  7  2 to drug testing before being approved to receive assistance
  7  3 on behalf of the child.  A protective payee with a confirmed
  7  4 positive test result is ineligible to receive assistance on
  7  5 behalf of the child.
  7  6    The department is required to adopt rules to implement the
  7  7 new requirements.

  6 13 in the required drug testing is ineligible for cash assistance
  6 14 through FIP.  A person who has a confirmed positive test result
  6 15 is ineligible for one year unless the test result was for a
  6 16 controlled substance for which the person has a prescription.

  6 21 of ineligibility if a person reapplies but has a subsequent
  6 22 confirmed positive test result; provide a listing of licensed
  6 23 substance abuse treatment programs available in the area of a
  6 24 person's residence if the person has a confirmed positive test
  6 25 result; and allow for a person who has a confirmed positive
  6 26 test result to reapply one time after six months if the person
  6 27 provides documentation of completing a licensed substance abuse

  6 29 test result and passes another drug test.
  6 30    If a parent is deemed ineligible for assistance as a result
  6 31 of having a confirmed positive test result, the dependent child
  6 32 remains eligible for assistance and a protective payee may be
  6 33 designated by the parent to receive the assistance on behalf of
  6 34 the child.  If a specified relative or other immediate family
  6 35 member declines to be designated, the department must designate
  7  1 the protective payee.  The protective payee is then subject
  7  2 to drug testing before being approved to receive assistance
  7  3 on behalf of the child.  A protective payee with a confirmed
  7  4 positive test result is ineligible to receive assistance on
  7  5 behalf of the child.

  5 30 relative who is included in the applicant family, including
  5 31 both parents of a two=parent family, or an individual who may

  3 25 paragraph "f".
  3 26    e.  Provide any person with a confirmed positive test result
  3 27 with a list of licensed substance abuse treatment programs
  3 28 available in the area in which the person resides. Neither the

  3 31 conducted under this section.
  3 32    f.  A person with a confirmed positive test result who is

  4 23 immediate family member unless such family member is not
  4 24 available or the family member declines the designation. In
  4 25 which case another individual, approved by the department,
  4 26 shall be designated as the protective payee. The individual
  4 27 must also undergo drug testing before being approved to be
  4 28 the protective payee. If the designated individual has a

  4 33                           EXPLANATION
  4 34 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  4 35 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  5  1 This bill requires drug testing of applicants for and
  5  2 certain recipients of assistance under the family investment
  5  3 program (FIP) in new Code section 239B.2D.  The program
  5  4 provides cash assistance and employment=related services to
  5  5 low=income families with children under the federal temporary
  5  6 assistance for needy families (TANF) block grant.  The
  5  7 department of human services administers the program and block
  5  8 grant for this state.
  5  9    The bill utilizes the following terms that are defined in
  5 10 Code section 239B.1:
  5 11    "Applicant" means a person who files an application for
  5 12 participation in FIP under Code chapter 239B.
  5 13    "Assistance" means a FIP payment.
  5 14    "Family" means a family unit that includes at least one
  5 15 child and at least one parent or other specified relative of
  5 16 the child.
  5 17    "Minor parent" means an applicant or participant parent who
  5 18 is less than 18 years of age and has never been married.
  5 19    "PROMISE JOBS program" or "JOBS program" means the promoting
  5 20 independence and self=sufficiency through employment job
  5 21 opportunities and basic skills program, a part of FIP.
  5 22    "Specified relative" means a person who is, or was at any
  5 23 time, a relative of an applicant or participant child, by means
  5 24 of blood relationship, marriage, or adoption, or is a spouse of
  5 25 a relative listed in the definition.
  5 26    The bill defines "confirmed positive test result", "licensed
  5 27 substance abuse treatment program", and "sample".
  5 28    The drug testing requirement applies to each applicant for
  5 29 FIP assistance who is an adult parent, guardian, or specified
  5 30 relative who is included in the applicant family, including
  5 31 both parents of a two=parent family, or an individual who may
  5 32 be exempt from work activity requirements due to the age of the
  5 33 youngest child or who may be exempt from work activity under
  5 34 the PROMISE JOBS program.  The requirement also applies to
  5 35 each minor parent applicant who is not required to live with
  6  1 a parent, guardian, or other adult caretaker.  In addition,
  6  2 a recipient of assistance who accepted the drug testing
  6  3 requirements at the time of application and for whom there is
  6  4 information indicating a significant likelihood the recipient
  6  5 is using a controlled substance is subject to random drug
  6  6 testing. Dependent children under the age of 18 years are
  6  7 exempt from the drug testing requirements. The department is
  6  8 directed to require a drug test of each person who is subject
  6  9 to the requirements to screen for the presence of controlled
  6 10 substances.  The person is responsible for the cost of the drug
  6 11 test.
  6 12    A person subject to the requirement who does not participate
  6 13 in the required drug testing is ineligible for cash assistance
  6 14 through FIP.  A person who has a confirmed positive test result
  6 15 is ineligible for one year unless the test result was for a
  6 16 controlled substance for which the person has a prescription.
  6 17    The department is required to do all of the following
  6 18 in administering the drug testing requirement:  implement
  6 19 notification provisions; allow for additional testing following
  6 20 a confirmed positive test result; apply a three=year period
  6 21 of ineligibility if a person reapplies but has a subsequent
  6 22 confirmed positive test result; provide a listing of licensed
  6 23 substance abuse treatment programs available in the area of a
  6 24 person's residence if the person has a confirmed positive test
  6 25 result; and allow for a person who has a confirmed positive
  6 26 test result to reapply one time after six months if the person
  6 27 provides documentation of completing a licensed substance abuse
  6 28 treatment program within six months of the confirmed positive
  6 29 test result and passes another drug test.
  6 30    If a parent is deemed ineligible for assistance as a result
  6 31 of having a confirmed positive test result, the dependent child
  6 32 remains eligible for assistance and a protective payee may be
  6 33 designated by the parent to receive the assistance on behalf of
  6 34 the child.  If a specified relative or other immediate family
  6 35 member declines to be designated, the department must designate
  7  1 the protective payee.  The protective payee is then subject
  7  2 to drug testing before being approved to receive assistance
  7  3 on behalf of the child.  A protective payee with a confirmed
  7  4 positive test result is ineligible to receive assistance on
  7  5 behalf of the child.
  7  6    The department is required to adopt rules to implement the
  7  7 new requirements.

  5 30 relative who is included in the applicant family, including
  5 31 both parents of a two=parent family, or an individual who may
  5 32 be exempt from work activity requirements due to the age of the

  5 34 the PROMISE JOBS program.  The requirement also applies to
  5 35 each minor parent applicant who is not required to live with

  6 13 in the required drug testing is ineligible for cash assistance
  6 14 through FIP.  A person who has a confirmed positive test result
  6 15 is ineligible for one year unless the test result was for a
  6 16 controlled substance for which the person has a prescription.

  6 19 notification provisions; allow for additional testing following
  6 20 a confirmed positive test result; apply a three=year period
  6 21 of ineligibility if a person reapplies but has a subsequent
  6 22 confirmed positive test result; provide a listing of licensed

  6 27 provides documentation of completing a licensed substance abuse
  6 28 treatment program within six months of the confirmed positive
  6 29 test result and passes another drug test.
  6 30    If a parent is deemed ineligible for assistance as a result
  6 31 of having a confirmed positive test result, the dependent child
  6 32 remains eligible for assistance and a protective payee may be
  6 33 designated by the parent to receive the assistance on behalf of
  6 34 the child.  If a specified relative or other immediate family
  6 35 member declines to be designated, the department must designate
  7  1 the protective payee.  The protective payee is then subject
  7  2 to drug testing before being approved to receive assistance
  7  3 on behalf of the child.  A protective payee with a confirmed
  7  4 positive test result is ineligible to receive assistance on
  7  5 behalf of the child.

  5  6 assistance for needy families (TANF) block grant.  The
  5  7 department of human services administers the program and block
  5  8 grant for this state.

  5 26    The bill defines "confirmed positive test result", "licensed
  5 27 substance abuse treatment program", and "sample".
  5 28    The drug testing requirement applies to each applicant for
  5 29 FIP assistance who is an adult parent, guardian, or specified
  5 30 relative who is included in the applicant family, including
  5 31 both parents of a two=parent family, or an individual who may
  5 32 be exempt from work activity requirements due to the age of the
  5 33 youngest child or who may be exempt from work activity under
  5 34 the PROMISE JOBS program.  The requirement also applies to
  5 35 each minor parent applicant who is not required to live with
  6  1 a parent, guardian, or other adult caretaker.  In addition,
  6  2 a recipient of assistance who accepted the drug testing
  6  3 requirements at the time of application and for whom there is

  6  9 to the requirements to screen for the presence of controlled
  6 10 substances.  The person is responsible for the cost of the drug
  6 11 test.
  6 12    A person subject to the requirement who does not participate
  6 13 in the required drug testing is ineligible for cash assistance
  6 14 through FIP.  A person who has a confirmed positive test result
  6 15 is ineligible for one year unless the test result was for a
  6 16 controlled substance for which the person has a prescription.
  6 17    The department is required to do all of the following
  6 18 in administering the drug testing requirement:  implement
  6 19 notification provisions; allow for additional testing following
  6 20 a confirmed positive test result; apply a three=year period

  6 24 person's residence if the person has a confirmed positive test
  6 25 result; and allow for a person who has a confirmed positive
  6 26 test result to reapply one time after six months if the person
  6 27 provides documentation of completing a licensed substance abuse
  6 28 treatment program within six months of the confirmed positive
  6 29 test result and passes another drug test.
  6 30    If a parent is deemed ineligible for assistance as a result
  6 31 of having a confirmed positive test result, the dependent child
  6 32 remains eligible for assistance and a protective payee may be
  6 33 designated by the parent to receive the assistance on behalf of
  6 34 the child.  If a specified relative or other immediate family
  6 35 member declines to be designated, the department must designate
  7  1 the protective payee.  The protective payee is then subject
  7  2 to drug testing before being approved to receive assistance
  7  3 on behalf of the child.  A protective payee with a confirmed
  7  4 positive test result is ineligible to receive assistance on
  7  5 behalf of the child.

  5  5 low=income families with children under the federal temporary
  5  6 assistance for needy families (TANF) block grant.  The
  5  7 department of human services administers the program and block
  5  8 grant for this state.

  5 26    The bill defines "confirmed positive test result", "licensed
  5 27 substance abuse treatment program", and "sample".
  5 28    The drug testing requirement applies to each applicant for
  5 29 FIP assistance who is an adult parent, guardian, or specified
  5 30 relative who is included in the applicant family, including
  5 31 both parents of a two=parent family, or an individual who may
  5 32 be exempt from work activity requirements due to the age of the
  5 33 youngest child or who may be exempt from work activity under
  5 34 the PROMISE JOBS program.  The requirement also applies to

  6 27 provides documentation of completing a licensed substance abuse
  6 28 treatment program within six months of the confirmed positive
  6 29 test result and passes another drug test.
  6 30    If a parent is deemed ineligible for assistance as a result
  6 31 of having a confirmed positive test result, the dependent child
  6 32 remains eligible for assistance and a protective payee may be

  6 34 the child.  If a specified relative or other immediate family
  6 35 member declines to be designated, the department must designate
  7  1 the protective payee.  The protective payee is then subject
  7  2 to drug testing before being approved to receive assistance

  7  4 positive test result is ineligible to receive assistance on
  7  5 behalf of the child.

  5  6 assistance for needy families (TANF) block grant.  The
  5  7 department of human services administers the program and block
  5  8 grant for this state.

  5 26    The bill defines "confirmed positive test result", "licensed
  5 27 substance abuse treatment program", and "sample".
  5 28    The drug testing requirement applies to each applicant for
  5 29 FIP assistance who is an adult parent, guardian, or specified
  5 30 relative who is included in the applicant family, including
  5 31 both parents of a two=parent family, or an individual who may
  5 32 be exempt from work activity requirements due to the age of the
  5 33 youngest child or who may be exempt from work activity under
  5 34 the PROMISE JOBS program.  The requirement also applies to

  6 29 test result and passes another drug test.
  6 30    If a parent is deemed ineligible for assistance as a result
  6 31 of having a confirmed positive test result, the dependent child
  6 32 remains eligible for assistance and a protective payee may be
  6 33 designated by the parent to receive the assistance on behalf of
  6 34 the child.  If a specified relative or other immediate family
  6 35 member declines to be designated, the department must designate
  7  1 the protective payee.  The protective payee is then subject
  7  2 to drug testing before being approved to receive assistance
  7  3 on behalf of the child.  A protective payee with a confirmed
  7  4 positive test result is ineligible to receive assistance on
  7  5 behalf of the child.

  5 28    The drug testing requirement applies to each applicant for
  5 29 FIP assistance who is an adult parent, guardian, or specified
  5 30 relative who is included in the applicant family, including
  5 31 both parents of a two=parent family, or an individual who may
  5 32 be exempt from work activity requirements due to the age of the
  5 33 youngest child or who may be exempt from work activity under
  5 34 the PROMISE JOBS program.  The requirement also applies to

  6 27 provides documentation of completing a licensed substance abuse
  6 28 treatment program within six months of the confirmed positive
  6 29 test result and passes another drug test.
  6 30    If a parent is deemed ineligible for assistance as a result
  6 31 of having a confirmed positive test result, the dependent child
  6 32 remains eligible for assistance and a protective payee may be
  6 33 designated by the parent to receive the assistance on behalf of
  6 34 the child.  If a specified relative or other immediate family
  6 35 member declines to be designated, the department must designate
  7  1 the protective payee.  The protective payee is then subject
  7  2 to drug testing before being approved to receive assistance

  7  4 positive test result is ineligible to receive assistance on
  7  5 behalf of the child.

  5 29 FIP assistance who is an adult parent, guardian, or specified
  5 30 relative who is included in the applicant family, including
  5 31 both parents of a two=parent family, or an individual who may
  5 32 be exempt from work activity requirements due to the age of the

  6 34 the child.  If a specified relative or other immediate family
  6 35 member declines to be designated, the department must designate

  7  4 positive test result is ineligible to receive assistance on
  7  5 behalf of the child.

  5  6 assistance for needy families (TANF) block grant.  The
  5  7 department of human services administers the program and block
  5  8 grant for this state.

  5 25 a relative listed in the definition.
  5 26    The bill defines "confirmed positive test result", "licensed
  5 27 substance abuse treatment program", and "sample".
  5 28    The drug testing requirement applies to each applicant for
  5 29 FIP assistance who is an adult parent, guardian, or specified
  5 30 relative who is included in the applicant family, including
  5 31 both parents of a two=parent family, or an individual who may
  5 32 be exempt from work activity requirements due to the age of the
  5 33 youngest child or who may be exempt from work activity under
  5 34 the PROMISE JOBS program.  The requirement also applies to
  5 35 each minor parent applicant who is not required to live with
  6  1 a parent, guardian, or other adult caretaker.  In addition,

  6 11 test.
  6 12    A person subject to the requirement who does not participate
  6 13 in the required drug testing is ineligible for cash assistance
  6 14 through FIP.  A person who has a confirmed positive test result
  6 15 is ineligible for one year unless the test result was for a
  6 16 controlled substance for which the person has a prescription.

  6 25 result; and allow for a person who has a confirmed positive
  6 26 test result to reapply one time after six months if the person
  6 27 provides documentation of completing a licensed substance abuse
  6 28 treatment program within six months of the confirmed positive
  6 29 test result and passes another drug test.
  6 30    If a parent is deemed ineligible for assistance as a result
  6 31 of having a confirmed positive test result, the dependent child
  6 32 remains eligible for assistance and a protective payee may be
  6 33 designated by the parent to receive the assistance on behalf of
  6 34 the child.  If a specified relative or other immediate family
  6 35 member declines to be designated, the department must designate
  7  1 the protective payee.  The protective payee is then subject
  7  2 to drug testing before being approved to receive assistance
  7  3 on behalf of the child.  A protective payee with a confirmed
  7  4 positive test result is ineligible to receive assistance on
  7  5 behalf of the child.

  6 25 result; and allow for a person who has a confirmed positive
  6 26 test result to reapply one time after six months if the person
  6 27 provides documentation of completing a licensed substance abuse
  6 28 treatment program within six months of the confirmed positive
  6 29 test result and passes another drug test.
  6 30    If a parent is deemed ineligible for assistance as a result
  6 31 of having a confirmed positive test result, the dependent child
  6 32 remains eligible for assistance and a protective payee may be
  6 33 designated by the parent to receive the assistance on behalf of
  6 34 the child.  If a specified relative or other immediate family
  6 35 member declines to be designated, the department must designate
  7  1 the protective payee.  The protective payee is then subject
  7  2 to drug testing before being approved to receive assistance
  7  3 on behalf of the child.  A protective payee with a confirmed
  7  4 positive test result is ineligible to receive assistance on
  7  5 behalf of the child.

  5  1 This bill requires drug testing of applicants for and
  5  2 certain recipients of assistance under the family investment
  5  3 program (FIP) in new Code section 239B.2D.  The program
  5  4 provides cash assistance and employment=related services to
  5  5 low=income families with children under the federal temporary
  5  6 assistance for needy families (TANF) block grant.  The
  5  7 department of human services administers the program and block
  5  8 grant for this state.

  5 12 participation in FIP under Code chapter 239B.
  5 13    "Assistance" means a FIP payment.

  5 23 time, a relative of an applicant or participant child, by means
  5 24 of blood relationship, marriage, or adoption, or is a spouse of
  5 25 a relative listed in the definition.
  5 26    The bill defines "confirmed positive test result", "licensed
  5 27 substance abuse treatment program", and "sample".
  5 28    The drug testing requirement applies to each applicant for
  5 29 FIP assistance who is an adult parent, guardian, or specified
  5 30 relative who is included in the applicant family, including
  5 31 both parents of a two=parent family, or an individual who may
  5 32 be exempt from work activity requirements due to the age of the
  5 33 youngest child or who may be exempt from work activity under
  5 34 the PROMISE JOBS program.  The requirement also applies to
  5 35 each minor parent applicant who is not required to live with
  6  1 a parent, guardian, or other adult caretaker.  In addition,

  6 11 test.
  6 12    A person subject to the requirement who does not participate
  6 13 in the required drug testing is ineligible for cash assistance
  6 14 through FIP.  A person who has a confirmed positive test result
  6 15 is ineligible for one year unless the test result was for a
  6 16 controlled substance for which the person has a prescription.

  6 24 person's residence if the person has a confirmed positive test
  6 25 result; and allow for a person who has a confirmed positive
  6 26 test result to reapply one time after six months if the person
  6 27 provides documentation of completing a licensed substance abuse
  6 28 treatment program within six months of the confirmed positive
  6 29 test result and passes another drug test.
  6 30    If a parent is deemed ineligible for assistance as a result
  6 31 of having a confirmed positive test result, the dependent child
  6 32 remains eligible for assistance and a protective payee may be
  6 33 designated by the parent to receive the assistance on behalf of
  6 34 the child.  If a specified relative or other immediate family
  6 35 member declines to be designated, the department must designate
  7  1 the protective payee.  The protective payee is then subject
  7  2 to drug testing before being approved to receive assistance
  7  3 on behalf of the child.  A protective payee with a confirmed
  7  4 positive test result is ineligible to receive assistance on
  7  5 behalf of the child.
  7  6    The department is required to adopt rules to implement the
  7  7 new requirements.
