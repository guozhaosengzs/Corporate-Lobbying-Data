 33 11    This bill relates to state taxes by repealing the individual
 33 12 income tax and increasing the state sales and use tax rates.
 33 13    Division I repeals the individual income tax and makes
 33 14 numerous conforming changes to the Code to remove references

 33 26 required to fully implement the division and requires the
 33 27 director of the department of revenue to prepare draft

 34 10 revenue as it did prior to the sales tax rate increase provided
