to
an
overall
plan
of
transmitting

in
the
public
1


interest.
The
bill
provides
that
a
finding
of
public
use
and
2


public
interest
shall
not
be
made
in
the
event
a
petition
for
3


a

an

of
franchise
sets
forth
that
the
4


exercise
of
eminent
domain
will

and
the
petition
is
5


filed
by
or
involves
a
merchant
transmission
line
or
company
6


that
sells
less
than
50

the
electricity
transmitted
7


through
this
state
by
the
line
or
company
to
a

The
bill
defines
a
“merchant

line
or
company”
to
mean
an
entity
that
generates
and
10


transmits,
or
solely
transmits,
electricity
through

The

subsection

paragraph

13


as

facilities

provides
that
for
the

that
Code
section,
the
term
“public”
shall
not
be
20


interpreted
to
be
limited
to
consumers
located

Iowa.
The
21


bill
modifies
this
provision
to
instead
specify
that
the
term
22


“public”

chapter
478
in

to
public
23


use,

application
to

is
held
invalid
or
28


otherwise
rendered
ineffective
by
any
entity,
the
invalidity
29


or
ineffectiveness
shall
not
affect
other
provisions
or
30


applications
of
the
Code
chapter
that
can
be

or
