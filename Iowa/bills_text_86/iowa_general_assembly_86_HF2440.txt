  3  4 or emergency=related work during a disaster response period
  3  5 shall not be considered to have established a level of presence
  3  6 that would subject the out=of=state business to any of the
  3  7 following:
  3  8    (1)  The requirement to complete or obtain any state or local

  3 25 responsibility to pay such tax.
  3 26    (3)  The imposition of income taxes under chapter 422,

  4 20 the disaster response period.
  4 21    b.  Notwithstanding any other provision of law to the
  4 22 contrary, the performance of disaster or emergency=related
  4 23 work during a disaster response period by an out=of=state
  4 24 employee shall not be used as the basis to determine that the
  4 25 out=of=state employee has established residency or a level of

  5 11 during a disaster response period if such tangible personal
  5 12 property or equipment does not remain in the state after the
  5 13 conclusion of the disaster response period.
  5 14    c.  During a disaster response period, an out=of=state
  5 15 business or an out=of=state employee shall be subject to all

  3 33 business or out=of=state employee shall not require an
  3 34 out=of=state business to be included in a consolidated return
  3 35 under section 422.37, and shall not increase the amount of net
  4  1 income of the out=of=state business allocated and apportioned

  4 27 of the following:
  4 28    (1)  The requirement to complete or obtain any state or local

  5 15 business or an out=of=state employee shall be subject to all
  5 16 taxes and fees not included in paragraphs "a" and "b", and this
  5 17 subsection shall not be construed to provide protection or

  3 12 limited to the requirement to register with the secretary of

  3 35 under section 422.37, and shall not increase the amount of net
  4  1 income of the out=of=state business allocated and apportioned
  4  2 to the state under sections 422.8 or 422.33, as applicable.
  4  3    (4)  The employment security requirements under chapter

  4 24 employee shall not be used as the basis to determine that the

  4 26 presence that would subject the out=of=state employee to any
  4 27 of the following:
  4 28    (1)  The requirement to complete or obtain any state or local
  4 29 registration, license, or similar authorization as a condition

  5 15 business or an out=of=state employee shall be subject to all
  5 16 taxes and fees not included in paragraphs "a" and "b", and this
  5 17 subsection shall not be construed to provide protection or
  5 18 exemption during a disaster response period or any other period
