  1 22 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  1 23 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  1 24    This bill relates to the sales tax exemption in Code section
  1 25 423.3(47) for the purchase or rental of computers, machinery,
  1 26 equipment, supplies, replacement parts, and materials used
  1 27 to construct those items (collectively "specified items")
  1 28 that are used in certain activities.  The bill provides
  1 29 that the specified items will be exempt from the sales
  1 30 tax if they are directly and primarily used to produce
  1 31 electricity to be offered for sale, provided the electricity
  1 32 is produced at a facility that has a generating capacity
  1 33 greater than 500 megawatts, that was originally placed in
  1 34 service prior to January 1, 2016, and that, on December 31,
  1 35 2015, was majority=owned by a person that is not a public
  2  1 utility as defined in Code section 476.1(3).  Code section
  2  2 476.1(3) generally defines a public utility as a person
  2  3 that is furnishing gas or water by pipe distribution system,
  2  4 electricity, or communication services to the public for
  2  5 compensation.
  2  6    Under current law, the sales tax exemption in Code section
  2  7 423.3(47) does not apply to industrial machinery, equipment,
  2  8 computers, and pollution=control equipment listed in Code
  2  9 section 427A.1(1)(h) and (i) (property assessed as real
  2 10 property).  The bill makes a conforming amendment to provide
  2 11 that this exclusion from the sales tax exemption does not
  2 12 apply to the specified items used to produce electricity to be
  2 13 offered for sale.
  2 14    By operation of Code section 423.6, an item exempt from the
  2 15 imposition of the sales tax is also exempt from the use tax
  2 16 imposed in Code section 423.5.
