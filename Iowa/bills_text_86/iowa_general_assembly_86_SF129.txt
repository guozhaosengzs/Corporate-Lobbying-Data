  3  6    This bill requires the submission of proof of financial
  3  7 assurance prior to issuance of a permit to construct, maintain,
  3  8 and operate a hazardous liquid pipeline by the Iowa utilities
  3  9 board.
  3 10    Current provisions contained in Code section 479B.13
  3 11 require an applicant to satisfy the board that the applicant
  3 12 has property within Iowa other than pipelines or underground
  3 13 storage facilities subject to execution of a value in excess
  3 14 of $250,000, or requires the applicant to file and maintain a
  3 15 surety bond in that amount.  These provisions relate to damages
  3 16 attributable to the construction, maintenance, or operation of
  3 17 the pipeline or underground storage facility.
  3 18    The bill creates a new Code section 479B.13A which
  3 19 requires that before a permit is granted for a pipeline to be
  3 20 constructed on or after January 1, 2015, and in addition to

  3 22 provide to the board a financial assurance instrument verifying
  3 23 that the applicant has the financial capability to provide
  3 24 reasonable and necessary remedial response and to respond in
  3 25 damages for claims arising from the accidental discharge of
  3 26 hazardous liquid.  The bill states that the financial assurance
  3 27 instrument shall meet all requirements adopted by rule by the
  3 28 board, and shall not be issued, canceled, revoked, disbursed,
  3 29 released, or allowed to terminate without board approval.
  3 30 The bill defines a "financial assurance instrument" to mean
  3 31 one or a combination of establishing a secured trust fund,
  3 32 using a cash or surety bond,  obtaining insurance, satisfying
  3 33 a corporate or local government financial test, obtaining

  4  3 required for accidental hazardous liquid discharge liability
  4  4 for the first calendar year during which hazardous liquid is
  4  5 shipped, and shall be $250,000 per mile of pipeline.  For
