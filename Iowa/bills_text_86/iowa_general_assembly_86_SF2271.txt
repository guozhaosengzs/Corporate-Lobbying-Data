  1 29 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  1 30 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  1 31    This bill relates to the criminal offense of identity theft.
  1 32    Current law provides that a person commits identity theft
  1 33 when a person fraudulently uses or attempts to fraudulently use
  1 34 identification information of another person, with the intent
  1 35 to obtain credit, property, services, or other benefit.
  2  1 The bill adds the term "other benefit" to the penalty
  2  2 language in Code section 715A.8(3) to align the language with
  2  3 the elements of the crime of identity theft in Code section
  2  4 715A.8(2).
  2  5    The bill also aligns the language in Code section 715A.9
  2  6 relating to the calculation of the value of the identity theft
  2  7 with the language in Code section 715A.8.
  2  8    The bill also enhances the penalty for identity theft if
  2  9 the value of the credit, property, services, or other benefit
  2 10 obtained through identity theft exceeds $10,000.  Under the
  2 11 bill, a person commits a class "C" felony if the value exceeds
  2 12 $10,000. The bill does not change the criminal penalty for
  2 13 identity theft where the value of the benefit obtained is
  2 14 $10,000 or less.  If the value exceeds $1,000 but does not
  2 15 exceed $10,000, the penalty remains a class "D" felony and
  2 16 if the value does not exceed $1,000, the penalty remains an
  2 17 aggravated misdemeanor.
  2 18    A class "C" felony is punishable by confinement for no more
  2 19 than 10 years and a fine of at least $1,000 but not more than
  2 20 $10,000.  A class "D" felony is punishable by confinement for
  2 21 no more than five years and a fine of at least $750 but not
  2 22 more than $7,500.  An aggravated misdemeanor is punishable by
  2 23 confinement for no more than two years and a fine of at least
  2 24 $625 but not more than $6,250.
