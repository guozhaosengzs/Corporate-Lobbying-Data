  2 11 pipeline or underground storage facility to demonstrate that
  2 12 the applicant has property within Iowa other than pipelines
  2 13 or underground storage facilities, subject to execution of a
  2 14 value in excess of $250,000, or that the applicant has filed

  2 29 annual verification to the board that the insurance has been
  2 30 obtained and remains in force, and provides that the insurance
  2 31 shall not be canceled, revoked, or allowed to terminate
  2 32 without board approval. Pursuant to Code section 479B.14,

  2  6    This bill requires insurance to be obtained by an applicant
  2  7 prior to the granting of a permit to construct, maintain, or
  2  8 operate a hazardous liquid pipeline.
  2  9    Currently, Code section 479B.13 requires an applicant for a
  2 10 permit to construct, maintain, or operate a hazardous liquid
  2 11 pipeline or underground storage facility to demonstrate that
  2 12 the applicant has property within Iowa other than pipelines
  2 13 or underground storage facilities, subject to execution of a
  2 14 value in excess of $250,000, or that the applicant has filed
  2 15 and will maintain with the board a surety bond in the penal sum
  2 16 of $250,000 with surety approved by the board, conditioned that
  2 17 the applicant will pay any and all damages legally recovered
  2 18 against it growing out of the construction, maintenance, or
  2 19 operation of its pipeline or underground storage facilities.
  2 20    The bill adds the additional requirement, applicable to
  2 21 hazardous liquid pipelines constructed on or after January 1,
  2 22 2015, that the applicant obtain insurance sufficient to provide
  2 23 reasonable and necessary remedial response and to respond

  2 26 insurance shall be determined by the Iowa utilities board upon
  2 27 review of the petition the applicant submitted pursuant to Code
  2 28 section 479B.5.  The bill requires the applicant to submit
  2 29 annual verification to the board that the insurance has been
  2 30 obtained and remains in force, and provides that the insurance
  2 31 shall not be canceled, revoked, or allowed to terminate
