 11 35 jobseekers, and to develop and improve the one=stop delivery
 12  1 system in local areas to support the effective delivery of
 12  2 services to employers, workers, and jobseekers.
 12  3    New Code section 84A.2 establishes the duties of the renamed
 12  4 board relating to human capital enrichment and establishes a
 12  5 human capital enrichment operations team.  Such duties require
