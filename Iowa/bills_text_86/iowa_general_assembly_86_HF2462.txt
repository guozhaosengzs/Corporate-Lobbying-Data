  5 23                           EXPLANATION
  5 24 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  5 25 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  5 26    BIOFUELS TAX CREDIT AND REFUND EXTENSIONS.  This bill
  5 27 extends the expiration date of four biofuel tax programs from
  5 28 January 1, 2018, to January 1, 2025, including three income tax
  5 29 credits and one sales and use tax refund.
  5 30    BIODIESEL FUEL TAX CREDIT ==== INCREASED TAX CREDIT RATE FOR
  5 31 B=11 OR HIGHER.  Beginning January 1, 2018, the bill decreases
  5 32 the designated tax credit rate for the sale of biodiesel
  5 33 blended fuel classified as B=5 or higher but not as high as
  5 34 B=11 from 4.5 to 3.5 cents per gallon and correspondingly the
  5 35 designated tax credit rate for the sale of biodiesel blended
  6  1 fuel classified as B=11 or higher is increased from 4.5 cents
  6  2 to 5.5 cents per gallon. The bill also provides that the
  6  3 department of revenue is required to adopt rules to account for
  6  4 errors in the blending of diesel fuel and biodiesel.
  6  5    BACKGROUND.  A biofuel is a substance blended with motor fuel
  6  6 (gasoline or diesel fuel) and includes either ethanol (ethyl
  6  7 alcohol) or biodiesel (a substance derived from vegetable
  6  8 oils or animal fats) meeting state standards (Code section
  6  9 214A.2).  A motor fuel blended with a biofuel is referred to
  6 10 as a renewable fuel.  The amount of the tax credit or refund
  6 11 is claimed by a taxpayer on a tax or calendar year basis after
  6 12 multiplying the total gallonage of a qualifying renewable fuel
  6 13 or biofuel times a designated monetary rate.
  6 14    CURRENT INCOME TAX CREDITS.  The income tax credits may
  6 15 be claimed by a retail dealer operating a retail motor fuel
  6 16 site and the amount of each tax credit is based on the total
  6 17 number of gallons of a renewable fuel sold.  The E=15 plus
  6 18 gasoline promotion tax credit requires an ethanol content of
  6 19 between 15 and 69 percent per gallon and the designated rate
  6 20 equals 3 cents except between June 1 and September 15 when
  6 21 the designated rate increases to 10 cents.  The E=85 gasoline
  6 22 promotion tax credit requires an ethanol content of between
  6 23 70 and 85 percent per gallon and the designated rate equals
  6 24 16 cents.  The biodiesel blended fuel tax credit requires a
  6 25 biodiesel content of at least 5 percent per gallon (B=5) and
  6 26 the designated rate equals 4.5 cents.
  6 27    SALES AND USE TAX REFUND.  The sales and use tax refund may
  6 28 be claimed by a biodiesel producer who manufactures biodiesel
  6 29 for use in biodiesel blended fuel.  The amount of the refund
  6 30 equals the total number of gallons of biodiesel produced during
  6 31 each calendar year quarter multiplied by a designated rate
  6 32 of 2 cents. However, a producer cannot claim the refund on
  6 33 more than 25 million gallons produced at any one manufacturing
  6 34 facility.
  6 35    FUTURE REPEAL OF REFERENCES TO THE ETHANOL PROMOTION TAX
  7  1 CREDIT.  The bill amends Code sections creating the E=85
  7  2 gasoline promotion tax credit and the E=15 plus gasoline
  7  3 promotion tax credit by repealing references to another tax
  7  4 credit referred to as the ethanol promotion tax credit claimed
  7  5 by a retail dealer who attains a certain threshold number of
  7  6 all biofuels sold during a determination period and which is
  7  7 based on the number of gallons of pure ethanol sold during that
  7  8 period.  The amendments become effective on January 1, 2021,
  7  9 which is the date that the ethanol promotion tax credit is due
  7 10 to expire.

  5 24 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  5 25 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  5 26    BIOFUELS TAX CREDIT AND REFUND EXTENSIONS.  This bill
  5 27 extends the expiration date of four biofuel tax programs from
  5 28 January 1, 2018, to January 1, 2025, including three income tax
  5 29 credits and one sales and use tax refund.
  5 30    BIODIESEL FUEL TAX CREDIT ==== INCREASED TAX CREDIT RATE FOR
  5 31 B=11 OR HIGHER.  Beginning January 1, 2018, the bill decreases
  5 32 the designated tax credit rate for the sale of biodiesel
  5 33 blended fuel classified as B=5 or higher but not as high as
  5 34 B=11 from 4.5 to 3.5 cents per gallon and correspondingly the
  5 35 designated tax credit rate for the sale of biodiesel blended
  6  1 fuel classified as B=11 or higher is increased from 4.5 cents
  6  2 to 5.5 cents per gallon. The bill also provides that the
  6  3 department of revenue is required to adopt rules to account for
  6  4 errors in the blending of diesel fuel and biodiesel.
  6  5    BACKGROUND.  A biofuel is a substance blended with motor fuel
  6  6 (gasoline or diesel fuel) and includes either ethanol (ethyl
  6  7 alcohol) or biodiesel (a substance derived from vegetable
  6  8 oils or animal fats) meeting state standards (Code section
  6  9 214A.2).  A motor fuel blended with a biofuel is referred to
  6 10 as a renewable fuel.  The amount of the tax credit or refund
  6 11 is claimed by a taxpayer on a tax or calendar year basis after
  6 12 multiplying the total gallonage of a qualifying renewable fuel
  6 13 or biofuel times a designated monetary rate.
  6 14    CURRENT INCOME TAX CREDITS.  The income tax credits may
  6 15 be claimed by a retail dealer operating a retail motor fuel
  6 16 site and the amount of each tax credit is based on the total
  6 17 number of gallons of a renewable fuel sold.  The E=15 plus
  6 18 gasoline promotion tax credit requires an ethanol content of
  6 19 between 15 and 69 percent per gallon and the designated rate
  6 20 equals 3 cents except between June 1 and September 15 when
  6 21 the designated rate increases to 10 cents.  The E=85 gasoline
  6 22 promotion tax credit requires an ethanol content of between
  6 23 70 and 85 percent per gallon and the designated rate equals
  6 24 16 cents.  The biodiesel blended fuel tax credit requires a
  6 25 biodiesel content of at least 5 percent per gallon (B=5) and
  6 26 the designated rate equals 4.5 cents.
  6 27    SALES AND USE TAX REFUND.  The sales and use tax refund may
  6 28 be claimed by a biodiesel producer who manufactures biodiesel
  6 29 for use in biodiesel blended fuel.  The amount of the refund
  6 30 equals the total number of gallons of biodiesel produced during
  6 31 each calendar year quarter multiplied by a designated rate
  6 32 of 2 cents. However, a producer cannot claim the refund on
  6 33 more than 25 million gallons produced at any one manufacturing
  6 34 facility.
  6 35    FUTURE REPEAL OF REFERENCES TO THE ETHANOL PROMOTION TAX
  7  1 CREDIT.  The bill amends Code sections creating the E=85
  7  2 gasoline promotion tax credit and the E=15 plus gasoline
  7  3 promotion tax credit by repealing references to another tax
  7  4 credit referred to as the ethanol promotion tax credit claimed
  7  5 by a retail dealer who attains a certain threshold number of
  7  6 all biofuels sold during a determination period and which is
  7  7 based on the number of gallons of pure ethanol sold during that
  7  8 period.  The amendments become effective on January 1, 2021,

  7 10 to expire.

  5 33 blended fuel classified as B=5 or higher but not as high as
  5 34 B=11 from 4.5 to 3.5 cents per gallon and correspondingly the
  5 35 designated tax credit rate for the sale of biodiesel blended

  6  2 to 5.5 cents per gallon. The bill also provides that the
  6  3 department of revenue is required to adopt rules to account for
  6  4 errors in the blending of diesel fuel and biodiesel.
  6  5    BACKGROUND.  A biofuel is a substance blended with motor fuel
  6  6 (gasoline or diesel fuel) and includes either ethanol (ethyl
  6  7 alcohol) or biodiesel (a substance derived from vegetable
  6  8 oils or animal fats) meeting state standards (Code section
  6  9 214A.2).  A motor fuel blended with a biofuel is referred to
  6 10 as a renewable fuel.  The amount of the tax credit or refund
  6 11 is claimed by a taxpayer on a tax or calendar year basis after
  6 12 multiplying the total gallonage of a qualifying renewable fuel
  6 13 or biofuel times a designated monetary rate.
  6 14    CURRENT INCOME TAX CREDITS.  The income tax credits may
  6 15 be claimed by a retail dealer operating a retail motor fuel
  6 16 site and the amount of each tax credit is based on the total
  6 17 number of gallons of a renewable fuel sold.  The E=15 plus
  6 18 gasoline promotion tax credit requires an ethanol content of
  6 19 between 15 and 69 percent per gallon and the designated rate
  6 20 equals 3 cents except between June 1 and September 15 when
  6 21 the designated rate increases to 10 cents.  The E=85 gasoline
  6 22 promotion tax credit requires an ethanol content of between
  6 23 70 and 85 percent per gallon and the designated rate equals
  6 24 16 cents.  The biodiesel blended fuel tax credit requires a
  6 25 biodiesel content of at least 5 percent per gallon (B=5) and
  6 26 the designated rate equals 4.5 cents.
  6 27    SALES AND USE TAX REFUND.  The sales and use tax refund may
  6 28 be claimed by a biodiesel producer who manufactures biodiesel
  6 29 for use in biodiesel blended fuel.  The amount of the refund
  6 30 equals the total number of gallons of biodiesel produced during
  6 31 each calendar year quarter multiplied by a designated rate
  6 32 of 2 cents. However, a producer cannot claim the refund on
  6 33 more than 25 million gallons produced at any one manufacturing
  6 34 facility.

  6  5    BACKGROUND.  A biofuel is a substance blended with motor fuel
  6  6 (gasoline or diesel fuel) and includes either ethanol (ethyl
  6  7 alcohol) or biodiesel (a substance derived from vegetable
  6  8 oils or animal fats) meeting state standards (Code section
  6  9 214A.2).  A motor fuel blended with a biofuel is referred to
  6 10 as a renewable fuel.  The amount of the tax credit or refund
  6 11 is claimed by a taxpayer on a tax or calendar year basis after
  6 12 multiplying the total gallonage of a qualifying renewable fuel
  6 13 or biofuel times a designated monetary rate.
  6 14    CURRENT INCOME TAX CREDITS.  The income tax credits may
  6 15 be claimed by a retail dealer operating a retail motor fuel
  6 16 site and the amount of each tax credit is based on the total
  6 17 number of gallons of a renewable fuel sold.  The E=15 plus
  6 18 gasoline promotion tax credit requires an ethanol content of
  6 19 between 15 and 69 percent per gallon and the designated rate
  6 20 equals 3 cents except between June 1 and September 15 when
  6 21 the designated rate increases to 10 cents.  The E=85 gasoline
  6 22 promotion tax credit requires an ethanol content of between
  6 23 70 and 85 percent per gallon and the designated rate equals
  6 24 16 cents.  The biodiesel blended fuel tax credit requires a
  6 25 biodiesel content of at least 5 percent per gallon (B=5) and
  6 26 the designated rate equals 4.5 cents.
  6 27    SALES AND USE TAX REFUND.  The sales and use tax refund may
  6 28 be claimed by a biodiesel producer who manufactures biodiesel
  6 29 for use in biodiesel blended fuel.  The amount of the refund
  6 30 equals the total number of gallons of biodiesel produced during
  6 31 each calendar year quarter multiplied by a designated rate
  6 32 of 2 cents. However, a producer cannot claim the refund on
