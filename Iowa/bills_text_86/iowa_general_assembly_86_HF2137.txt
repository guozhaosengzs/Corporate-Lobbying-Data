  2 25 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  2 26 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  2 27    This bill makes implementation of a Code provision which
  2 28 requires school districts to retain in grade three a student
  2 29 who is deficient in reading subject to an appropriation of
  2 30 funds by the general assembly for purposes of funding the
  2 31 intensive summer reading programs which school districts are
  2 32 required to offer beginning in the summer of 2017.
  2 33    Code section 279.68 lists a number of strategies that
  2 34 school districts are required to provide for students who are
  2 35 deficient in reading if funds are appropriated by the general
  3  1 assembly for purposes of implementing the provision.  The list
  3  2 of strategies includes summer reading programs. The bill makes
  3  3 the summer reading programs strategy requirement subject to an
  3  4 appropriation specifically made for that purpose.
  3  5    The bill establishes that provisions of Code section 279.68
  3  6 which require school districts to retain students in grade
  3  7 three who are deficient in reading, and which require school
  3  8 districts to provide a summer reading program as one of the
  3  9 strategies to remediate reading deficiencies, and which require
  3 10 school districts to offer intensive summer literacy programs
  3 11 by the summer of 2017, are all subject to an appropriation
  3 12 of sufficient funds by the general assembly for the specific
  3 13 purpose of implementing the summer reading programs. For
  3 14 consistency, the bill modifies the requirement to replace the
  3 15 word "literacy" with the word "reading".
  3 16    Currently, a school district may receive a waiver from the
  3 17 department of education from the requirement that the school
  3 18 district offer an intensive summer reading program in the
  3 19 summer of 2017.  The bill strikes the waiver language from the
  3 20 Code provision, but includes in session law a provision that
  3 21 notwithstands Code section 279.68 to allow a school district
  3 22 that is unable to meet the requirements of Code section 279.68
  3 23 relating to the implementation of an intensive summer reading
  3 24 program in the summer of 2017 to request a waiver from the

  3 26 of Code section 279.68 relating to the implementation of summer
  3 27 reading programs and to the retention of a student in grade
  3 28 three.
