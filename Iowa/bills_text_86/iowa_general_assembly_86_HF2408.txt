  5 32                           EXPLANATION
  5 33 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  5 34 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  5 35    This bill relates to the distribution and permissible
  6  1 expenditures of the E911 emergency communications service
  6  2 surcharge.
  6  3    Under current Code section 34A.7A, a monthly surcharge
  6  4 is imposed on all communications service providers in Iowa.
  6  5 Moneys collected pursuant to the surcharge are deposited in
  6  6 a fund and are distributed by the E911 program manager in a
  6  7 priority order as listed in Code section 34A.7A(2), paragraphs
  6  8 "a" through "f".
  6  9    The bill establishes a higher priority of funding for
  6 10 the contents of Code section 34A.7A(2), paragraph "e", which
  6 11 relates to funding to be provided to joint E911 service boards
  6 12 and to the department of public safety (DPS), and increases the
  6 13 amount of moneys allocated for funding under this paragraph
  6 14 from 46 percent to 60 percent of the total amount of surcharge
  6 15 generated. The bill also specifies that the funds allocated to
  6 16 such joint E911 boards and to DPS shall be used for "emergency"
  6 17 communication equipment to receive and dispose of 911 calls.
  6 18    The bill amends Code section 34A.7A(2), paragraph "f",
  6 19 which relates to the distribution of any moneys remaining
  6 20 after fully paying all prioritized obligations under the
  6 21 previous paragraphs, by establishing a new priority order for
  6 22 the expenditure and distribution of such remaining moneys.
  6 23 First in this priority order is an amount allocated to the
  6 24 E911 communications council to provide grants to public
  6 25 safety answering points agreeing to consolidate, not to exceed
  6 26 one=half of the cost of consolidation, or $200,000, whichever
  6 27 is less. Such grants may be provided until June 30, 2022.
  6 28 Second in this priority order is an amount, not to exceed
  6 29 $100,000 per year, to be allocated only for the development
  6 30 of public awareness and educational programs relating to the
  6 31 use and maintenance of E911 systems and not for the expenses
  6 32 of members of the E911 communications travel for meetings and
  6 33 training. Third in this priority order is for any remaining
  6 34 moneys to be allocated equally to the following: public safety
  6 35 answering points to fund future network improvements; costs
  7  1 related to access the Iowa interoperable communications system;
  7  2 costs related to the receipt and disposition of 911 calls; and
  7  3 wireless carriers' transport costs for wireless E911 services,
  7  4 if applicable.
  7  5    The bill provides the E911 communications council with the
  7  6 authority to provide grants to consolidating public safety
  7  7 answering points under Code section 34A.15.
  7  8    The bill requires the department of homeland security and
  7  9 emergency management to conduct a study to determine the most
  7 10 efficient method to consolidate public safety answering points.
  7 11 The department must submit a report containing the results of
  7 12 the study no later than January 15, 2017.
