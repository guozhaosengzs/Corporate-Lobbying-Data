Section
1.
Section
321J.6,
subsection
2,
Code
2015,
is
1


amended
to
read
as
follows:

2.
The
peace
officer
shall
determine
which
of
the
three
3


substances,
breath,
blood,
or
urine,
shall
be
tested.
Refusal
4


to
submit
to
a
chemical
test
of
urine
or
breath


under
this
5


section


is
deemed
a
refusal
to
submit,
and
section
321J.9
6


applies.
A
refusal
to
submit
to
a
chemical
test
of
blood
is
not


7


deemed
a
refusal
to
submit,
but
in
that
case,
the
peace
officer
8


shall
then
determine
which
one
of
the
other
two
substances
9


shall
be
tested
and
shall
offer
the
test.
If
the
peace
officer
10


fails
to
offer
a
test
within
two
hours
after
the
preliminary
11


screening
test
is
administered
or
refused
or
the
arrest
is
12


made,
whichever
occurs
first,
a
test
is
not
required,
and
there
13


shall
be
no
revocation
under
section
321J.9
.

EXPLANATION
15


The
inclusion
of
this
explanation
does
not
constitute
agreement
with
16


the
explanation’s
substance
by
the
members
of
the
general
assembly.
17


This
bill
relates
to
the
refusal
to
submit
to
a
chemical
test
18


of
blood
in
operating-while-intoxicated
(OWI)
cases.
19


Current
law
provides
that
a
person’s
refusal
to
submit
to
20


a
chemical
test
of
breath
or
urine
in
an
OWI
case
constitutes
21


grounds
for
the
department
of
transportation
(DOT)
to
22


administratively
revoke
the
person’s
driver’s
license
under
23


Code
section
321J.9.
The
bill
expands
the
grounds
sufficient
24


for
the
DOT
to
revoke
the
person’s
driver’s
license
under
Code
25


section
321J.9
to
include
a
person’s
refusal
to
submit
to
a
26


chemical
test
of
blood.
