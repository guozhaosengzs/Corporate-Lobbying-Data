precinct
caucus
for
2


up

beginning

of
the

The
bill
provides
that
the
employee
shall
4


make
a
written
application
with
their
employer
for
such

5


and
the
employee
is
not
liable

deduction
be
made
from
the
person’s
regular
salary
or
wages
7


except
for
the
period
of
time
of
the
absence.
8


The
bill
provides
that
the
requirement
to
allow
time
off
9


does
not
apply
if
the
person
is
employed
in
a
position
that
10


affects
the
protection
of
public
health
or
safety
or
by
an
11


entity
that
would
experience
severe
economic
disruption
due
12


to
the
person’s
absence.
Such
employer
must
file
a
written
13


notice
with

county
commissioner
of
elections
specifying
the
14


exigent
circumstances
justifying
the
denial
of
such
leave
and

number
of
persons
needed,
by
position,
to
protect
16


public
health
and
safety
or
maintain
minimum
operational
17


capacity,
and
that
the
number
of
persons
not
applying

is

19


The
denial
of
leave
for
those
number
of
persons
needed
to
20


reach
the
minimum
staffing
number
specified
must
be
done
in
a
21


nondiscriminatory
manner.
22


The
bill
also
permits
an
employer,
in
lieu
of
providing
23


unpaid
leave,
to
provide
paid
leave
for
the
absence
or
to
allow
24


affected
employees
the
option
to
work
the
hours
of
the
absence
25


at
such
other
time
so
long
as
either
option
is
made
available
26


to
all
affected
employees.
27


The
bill
provides
that
an
employer
who
denies
an
employee
28


the
privilege
conferred
by
this
bill
to
attend
a
presidential
29


precinct
caucus
commits
election
misconduct
in
the
fourth
30


degree,
a
simple
misdemeanor.
A
simple
misdemeanor
is
31


punishable
by
confinement
for

of

but
