 10 29                           EXPLANATION
 10 30 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
 10 31 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
 10 32    This bill relates to the confidentiality of juvenile court
 10 33 records.
 10 34    CONFIDENTIALITY OF JUVENILE RECORDS.  Under current law,
 10 35 juvenile court records in cases alleging delinquency are public
 11  1 records unless a judge either grants a request to make the
 11  2 records confidential or seals the records. The bill in Code
 11  3 section 232.147(3) provides that juvenile court records are
 11  4 confidential and therefore are not public records except in
 11  5 cases alleging the commission of a delinquent act that would be
 11  6 a forcible felony if committed by an adult. Under Code section
 11  7 702.11, a forcible felony is any felonious child endangerment,
 11  8 assault, murder, sexual abuse, kidnapping, robbery, human
 11  9 trafficking, arson in the first degree, or burglary in the
 11 10 first degree. If juvenile records are not confidential, the
 11 11 bill provides that a juvenile court officer may release such
 11 12 records.
 11 13    CONFIDENTIALITY ORDERS.  The bill in Code section 232.149A
 11 14 provides that a court shall order juvenile court records
 11 15 alleging the commission of a delinquent act that would be a
 11 16 forcible felony if committed by an adult to be confidential
 11 17 if the court finds that the case has been dismissed and the
 11 18 person is no longer subject to the jurisdiction of the juvenile
 11 19 court and that the child's interest in making the records
 11 20 confidential outweighs the public's interest in the records
 11 21 remaining public records.
 11 22    ACCESS TO CONFIDENTIAL JUVENILE RECORDS.  The bill and
 11 23 Code section 232.147(3) provide that unless an order sealing
 11 24 confidential juvenile records has been entered, confidential
 11 25 juvenile records may still be inspected, without a court
 11 26 order, by the judge and professional court staff, including
 11 27 juvenile court officers; the child and the child's counsel;
 11 28 the child's parent, guardian or custodian, court appointed
 11 29 special advocate, and guardian ad litem, and the members of
 11 30 the child advocacy board created in Code section 237.16 or a
 11 31 local citizen foster care review board created in accordance
 11 32 with Code section 237.19 who are assigning or reviewing the
 11 33 child's case; the county attorney and the county attorney's
 11 34 assistants; an agency, association, facility, or institution
 11 35 which has custody of the child, or is legally responsible for
 12  1 the care, treatment, or supervision of the child, including
 12  2 the department of human services; a court, court professional
 12  3 staff, and adult probation officers in connection with the
 12  4 preparation of a presentence report concerning a person
 12  5 who prior thereto had been the subject of a juvenile court
 12  6 delinquency proceeding; the child's foster parent or an
 12  7 individual providing preadoptive care to the child; the state
 12  8 public defender; the department of corrections; a judicial
 12  9 district department of correctional services; the board of
 12 10 parole; the superintendent or the superintendent's designee of
 12 11 the school district for the school attended by the child or
 12 12 the authorities in charge of an accredited nonpublic school
 12 13 attended by the child; a member of the armed forces of the
 12 14 United States who is conducting a background investigation of
 12 15 an individual pursuant to federal law; the statistical analysis
 12 16 center for the purposes stated in Code section 216A.136; a
 12 17 state or local law enforcement agency; and the alleged victim
 12 18 of any delinquent act in the proceeding.
 12 19    The bill in newly designated Code section 232.147(3A)
 12 20 provides that juvenile court records containing a petition or
 12 21 complaint alleging the commission of a delinquent act that
 12 22 would be a forcible felony if committed by an adult shall be
 12 23 public records unless subject to a confidentiality order under
 12 24 Code section 232.149A or a sealing order under Code section
 12 25 232.150.  However, the bill provides that such official records
 12 26 shall not be available to the public or any governmental
 12 27 agency through the internet or in an electronic customized
 12 28 data report unless the child has been adjudicated delinquent
 12 29 in the matter.  Nevertheless, the bill provides that official
 12 30 juvenile court records may be disclosed without a court order
 12 31 through the internet or in an electronic customized data
 12 32 report prior to the child being adjudicated delinquent to the
 12 33 judge and professional court staff, including juvenile court
 12 34 officers; the child's counsel or guardian ad litem; the county
 12 35 attorney and the county attorney's assistants; a court, court
 13  1 professional staff, and adult probation officers in connection
 13  2 with the preparation of a presentence report concerning a
 13  3 person who prior thereto had been the subject of a juvenile
 13  4 court proceeding; a state or local law enforcement agency; the
 13  5 state public defender; the statistical analysis center for
 13  6 the purposes stated in Code section 216A.136; the department
 13  7 of human services; the department of corrections; a judicial
 13  8 district department of correctional services; and the board of
 13  9 parole.
 13 10    CONFIDENTIALITY OF TRANSCRIPTS.  The bill in newly
 13 11 designated Code section 232.147(3B) provides that if the court
 13 12 has excluded the public from a hearing pursuant to Code section
 13 13 232.39 or 232.92, the transcript of the proceedings shall not
 13 14 be deemed a public record and inspection and disclosure of
 13 15 the contents of the transcript shall not be permitted except
 13 16 pursuant to a court order or unless otherwise provided in Code
 13 17 chapter 232.
 13 18    USE OF ADJUDICATION OF DELINQUENCY FOR PENALTY ENHANCEMENTS
 13 19 OR EVIDENCE.  The bill in newly designated Code section
 13 20 232.147(13) provides that the confidentiality of a final
 13 21 adjudication of delinquency under Code section 232.147 or
 13 22 pursuant to Code section 232.149A shall not prohibit the state
 13 23 from pleading or proving the adjudication at a subsequent
 13 24 criminal or delinquency proceeding for the purpose of penalty
 13 25 enhancement when a provision of the Code specifically deems the
 13 26 delinquency adjudication to constitute a final conviction.
 13 27    The bill in newly designated Code section 232.147(14)
 13 28 provides that the provisions of the bill shall not be construed
 13 29 to limit or restrict the production, use, or introduction
 13 30 of official juvenile court records in any juvenile or adult
 13 31 criminal proceeding, where such records are relevant and deemed
 13 32 admissible under any other provision of the law.
 13 33    CONFIDENTIALITY OF RECORDS AND FILES OF CRIMINAL OR
 13 34 JUVENILE JUSTICE AGENCIES.  Under current law, records and
 13 35 files of a criminal or juvenile justice agency concerning
 14  1 a child involved in a delinquent act are public records,
 14  2 subject to certain exceptions. The bill in Code section
 14  3 232.149 provides that the records and files of a criminal or
 14  4 juvenile justice agency, an intake officer, or a juvenile court
 14  5 officer concerning a child involved in a delinquent act are
 14  6 confidential. The bill further provides that the records of an
 14  7 intake officer or juvenile court officer containing a dismissal
 14  8 of a complaint or an informal adjustment of a complaint when
 14  9 no petition is filed relating to the complaint, shall not be
 14 10 available to the public, but may be disclosed to the judge and
 14 11 professional court staff, including juvenile court officers;
 14 12 the child's counsel or guardian ad litem; the county attorney
 14 13 and county attorney's assistants;  the superintendent or the
 14 14 superintendent's designee of the school district for the
 14 15 school attended by the child or the authorities in charge of
 14 16 an accredited nonpublic school attended by the child; a member
 14 17 of the armed forces of the United States who is conducting a
 14 18 background investigation of an individual pursuant to federal
 14 19 law; the statistical analysis center for the purposes stated
 14 20 in Code section 216A.136; the state public defender;  the
 14 21 department of human services; and the alleged victim of the
 14 22 delinquent act.
 14 23    PUBLIC RECORDS HEARINGS.  The bill enacts new Code section
 14 24 232.149B, which provides that a person may apply for a court
 14 25 order to make confidential juvenile court records public.
 14 26 The bill provides that a rebuttable presumption exists that
 14 27 official juvenile court records shall remain confidential. The
 14 28 bill provides that the court shall order the official juvenile
 14 29 court records in such a delinquency proceeding to be public
 14 30 records if either the public's interest in making the records
 14 31 public outweighs the juvenile's interest in maintaining the
 14 32 confidentiality of the records or the juvenile has been placed
 14 33 on youthful offender status pursuant to Code section 232.45(7)
 14 34 and Code section 907.3A(1), and will be transferred back to
 14 35 the district court for sentencing prior to the child's 18th
 15  1 birthday. The court may order the official juvenile court
 15  2 records in such a delinquency proceeding to be public records
 15  3 if the juvenile has been subsequently adjudicated delinquent
 15  4 for a public offense that would be a serious misdemeanor,
 15  5 aggravated misdemeanor, or felony offense if committed by an
 15  6 adult, or another delinquency proceeding is pending seeking
 15  7 such an adjudication. The bill provides that records subject
 15  8 to a public records order may be sealed at a later date
 15  9 pursuant to Code section 232.150.
 15 10    RIGHT TO REVIEW AND RELEASE A CONFIDENTIAL COMPLAINT.  The
 15 11 bill provides that delinquency complaints shall be released
 15 12 in accordance with Code section 915.25. Under current Code
 15 13 section 915.25, a complaint which alleges that a child who is
 15 14 at least 10 years of age committed a delinquent act, which if
 15 15 committed by an adult would be a public offense, is a public
 15 16 record. Current Code section 915.25 authorizes the court,
 15 17 its designee, or law enforcement officials to release such
 15 18 a complaint, including the identity of the child. The bill
 15 19 amends Code section 915.25 to provide that such a complaint
 15 20 is confidential unless the complaint alleges that the child
 15 21 committed a delinquent act that if committed by an adult would
 15 22 be a forcible felony. However, the bill authorizes state and
 15 23 local enforcement officials to release a confidential complaint
 15 24 against a child if the child is at large and doing so is deemed
 15 25 necessary for the protection of the public or the safety of
 15 26 the child. If the complaint is not confidential because the
 15 27 alleged delinquent act is an act that would be a forcible
 15 28 felony if committed by an adult, the court, its designee,
 15 29 or law enforcement officials may release such a complaint,
 15 30 including the identity of the child.
 15 31    The bill provides that an intake or juvenile court officer
 15 32 shall disclose to the alleged victim of a delinquent act, upon
 15 33 request, the complaint, the name and address of the child who
 15 34 allegedly committed the delinquent act, and the disposition
 15 35 of the complaint. If the alleged delinquent act would be
 16  1 a forcible felony if committed by an adult, the intake or
 16  2 juvenile court officer shall provide notification to the victim
 16  3 as required by Code section 915.24.
 16  4    SEALING OF JUVENILE COURT RECORDS UNAVAILABLE FOR
 16  5 OPERATING=WHILE=INTOXICATED VIOLATIONS.  Under current Code
 16  6 section 232.150, a court shall order juvenile court records
 16  7 to be sealed if the person who is the subject of the juvenile
 16  8 court records is 18 years of age or older and 2 years have
 16  9 elapsed since the last official action in the person's case,
 16 10 the person has not been subsequently convicted of a felony
 16 11 or an aggravated or serious misdemeanor or adjudicated a
 16 12 delinquent child for an act which if committed by an adult
 16 13 would be a felony, an aggravated misdemeanor, or a serious
 16 14 misdemeanor and no proceeding is pending seeking such
 16 15 conviction or adjudication, and the person was not placed on
 16 16 youthful offender status, transferred back to district court
 16 17 after the youthful offender's 18th birthday, and sentenced for
 16 18 the offense which precipitated the youthful offender placement.
 16 19 The bill in newly designated Code section 232.150(4) provides
 16 20 that the court shall not seal a person's juvenile court records
 16 21 if the person was adjudicated delinquent for violating Code
 16 22 section 321J.2, which prohibits the operation of a motor
 16 23 vehicle while under the influence of alcohol or a drug.
 16 24    RELEASE OF CONFIDENTIAL RECORDS.  The bill provides that a
 16 25 public record which is confidential under the provisions of
 16 26 Code chapter 232 shall only be subject to release upon order of
 16 27 a court in a proceeding under Code chapter 232.
 16 28    EXISTING CONFIDENTIALITY EXEMPTIONS.  The bill retains
 16 29 certain existing exemptions to confidentiality of juvenile
 16 30 court records. Pursuant to Code section 692A.121(8), records
 16 31 concerning sex offense convictions which are committed by
 16 32 minors may be released in the same manner as records of
 16 33 convictions of adults. Pursuant to Code section 915.10A,
 16 34 information concerning a juvenile charged with a felony offense
 16 35 may be released pursuant to an automated victim notification
 17  1 system. Under the bill, these exemptions to confidentiality
 17  2 are not amended and therefore still apply to juvenile court
 17  3 records.
 17  4    RIGHT TO COUNSEL.  The bill in Code section 232.11 provides
 17  5 that a child has the right to be represented by counsel at a
 17  6 hearing on a confidentiality order under Code section 232.149A
 17  7 or a public records order under Code section 232.149B.
 17  8    APPLICABILITY.  The bill applies to juvenile delinquency
 17  9 proceedings which are pending or arise on or after July 1,
 17 10 2016.
       LSB 5193HV (4) 86

 10 27 delinquency proceedings which are pending or arise on or after
 10 28 July 1, 2016.
 10 29                           EXPLANATION
 10 30 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
 10 31 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
 10 32    This bill relates to the confidentiality of juvenile court
 10 33 records.
 10 34    CONFIDENTIALITY OF JUVENILE RECORDS.  Under current law,
 10 35 juvenile court records in cases alleging delinquency are public
 11  1 records unless a judge either grants a request to make the
 11  2 records confidential or seals the records. The bill in Code
 11  3 section 232.147(3) provides that juvenile court records are
 11  4 confidential and therefore are not public records except in
 11  5 cases alleging the commission of a delinquent act that would be
 11  6 a forcible felony if committed by an adult. Under Code section
 11  7 702.11, a forcible felony is any felonious child endangerment,
 11  8 assault, murder, sexual abuse, kidnapping, robbery, human
 11  9 trafficking, arson in the first degree, or burglary in the
 11 10 first degree. If juvenile records are not confidential, the
 11 11 bill provides that a juvenile court officer may release such
 11 12 records.
 11 13    CONFIDENTIALITY ORDERS.  The bill in Code section 232.149A
 11 14 provides that a court shall order juvenile court records
 11 15 alleging the commission of a delinquent act that would be a
 11 16 forcible felony if committed by an adult to be confidential
 11 17 if the court finds that the case has been dismissed and the
 11 18 person is no longer subject to the jurisdiction of the juvenile
 11 19 court and that the child's interest in making the records
 11 20 confidential outweighs the public's interest in the records
 11 21 remaining public records.
 11 22    ACCESS TO CONFIDENTIAL JUVENILE RECORDS.  The bill and
 11 23 Code section 232.147(3) provide that unless an order sealing
 11 24 confidential juvenile records has been entered, confidential
 11 25 juvenile records may still be inspected, without a court
 11 26 order, by the judge and professional court staff, including
 11 27 juvenile court officers; the child and the child's counsel;
 11 28 the child's parent, guardian or custodian, court appointed
 11 29 special advocate, and guardian ad litem, and the members of
 11 30 the child advocacy board created in Code section 237.16 or a
 11 31 local citizen foster care review board created in accordance
 11 32 with Code section 237.19 who are assigning or reviewing the
 11 33 child's case; the county attorney and the county attorney's
 11 34 assistants; an agency, association, facility, or institution
 11 35 which has custody of the child, or is legally responsible for
 12  1 the care, treatment, or supervision of the child, including
 12  2 the department of human services; a court, court professional
 12  3 staff, and adult probation officers in connection with the
 12  4 preparation of a presentence report concerning a person
 12  5 who prior thereto had been the subject of a juvenile court
 12  6 delinquency proceeding; the child's foster parent or an
 12  7 individual providing preadoptive care to the child; the state
 12  8 public defender; the department of corrections; a judicial
 12  9 district department of correctional services; the board of
 12 10 parole; the superintendent or the superintendent's designee of
 12 11 the school district for the school attended by the child or
 12 12 the authorities in charge of an accredited nonpublic school
 12 13 attended by the child; a member of the armed forces of the
 12 14 United States who is conducting a background investigation of
 12 15 an individual pursuant to federal law; the statistical analysis
 12 16 center for the purposes stated in Code section 216A.136; a
 12 17 state or local law enforcement agency; and the alleged victim
 12 18 of any delinquent act in the proceeding.
 12 19    The bill in newly designated Code section 232.147(3A)
 12 20 provides that juvenile court records containing a petition or
 12 21 complaint alleging the commission of a delinquent act that
 12 22 would be a forcible felony if committed by an adult shall be
 12 23 public records unless subject to a confidentiality order under
 12 24 Code section 232.149A or a sealing order under Code section
 12 25 232.150.  However, the bill provides that such official records
 12 26 shall not be available to the public or any governmental
 12 27 agency through the internet or in an electronic customized
 12 28 data report unless the child has been adjudicated delinquent
 12 29 in the matter.  Nevertheless, the bill provides that official
 12 30 juvenile court records may be disclosed without a court order
 12 31 through the internet or in an electronic customized data
 12 32 report prior to the child being adjudicated delinquent to the
 12 33 judge and professional court staff, including juvenile court
 12 34 officers; the child's counsel or guardian ad litem; the county
 12 35 attorney and the county attorney's assistants; a court, court
 13  1 professional staff, and adult probation officers in connection
 13  2 with the preparation of a presentence report concerning a
 13  3 person who prior thereto had been the subject of a juvenile
 13  4 court proceeding; a state or local law enforcement agency; the
 13  5 state public defender; the statistical analysis center for
 13  6 the purposes stated in Code section 216A.136; the department
 13  7 of human services; the department of corrections; a judicial
 13  8 district department of correctional services; and the board of
 13  9 parole.
 13 10    CONFIDENTIALITY OF TRANSCRIPTS.  The bill in newly
 13 11 designated Code section 232.147(3B) provides that if the court
 13 12 has excluded the public from a hearing pursuant to Code section
 13 13 232.39 or 232.92, the transcript of the proceedings shall not
 13 14 be deemed a public record and inspection and disclosure of
 13 15 the contents of the transcript shall not be permitted except
 13 16 pursuant to a court order or unless otherwise provided in Code
 13 17 chapter 232.
 13 18    USE OF ADJUDICATION OF DELINQUENCY FOR PENALTY ENHANCEMENTS
 13 19 OR EVIDENCE.  The bill in newly designated Code section
 13 20 232.147(13) provides that the confidentiality of a final
 13 21 adjudication of delinquency under Code section 232.147 or
 13 22 pursuant to Code section 232.149A shall not prohibit the state
 13 23 from pleading or proving the adjudication at a subsequent
 13 24 criminal or delinquency proceeding for the purpose of penalty
 13 25 enhancement when a provision of the Code specifically deems the
 13 26 delinquency adjudication to constitute a final conviction.
 13 27    The bill in newly designated Code section 232.147(14)
 13 28 provides that the provisions of the bill shall not be construed
 13 29 to limit or restrict the production, use, or introduction
 13 30 of official juvenile court records in any juvenile or adult
 13 31 criminal proceeding, where such records are relevant and deemed
 13 32 admissible under any other provision of the law.
 13 33    CONFIDENTIALITY OF RECORDS AND FILES OF CRIMINAL OR
 13 34 JUVENILE JUSTICE AGENCIES.  Under current law, records and
 13 35 files of a criminal or juvenile justice agency concerning
 14  1 a child involved in a delinquent act are public records,
 14  2 subject to certain exceptions. The bill in Code section
 14  3 232.149 provides that the records and files of a criminal or
 14  4 juvenile justice agency, an intake officer, or a juvenile court
 14  5 officer concerning a child involved in a delinquent act are
 14  6 confidential. The bill further provides that the records of an
 14  7 intake officer or juvenile court officer containing a dismissal
 14  8 of a complaint or an informal adjustment of a complaint when
 14  9 no petition is filed relating to the complaint, shall not be
 14 10 available to the public, but may be disclosed to the judge and
 14 11 professional court staff, including juvenile court officers;
 14 12 the child's counsel or guardian ad litem; the county attorney
 14 13 and county attorney's assistants;  the superintendent or the
 14 14 superintendent's designee of the school district for the
 14 15 school attended by the child or the authorities in charge of
 14 16 an accredited nonpublic school attended by the child; a member
 14 17 of the armed forces of the United States who is conducting a
 14 18 background investigation of an individual pursuant to federal
 14 19 law; the statistical analysis center for the purposes stated
 14 20 in Code section 216A.136; the state public defender;  the
 14 21 department of human services; and the alleged victim of the
 14 22 delinquent act.
 14 23    PUBLIC RECORDS HEARINGS.  The bill enacts new Code section
 14 24 232.149B, which provides that a person may apply for a court
 14 25 order to make confidential juvenile court records public.
 14 26 The bill provides that a rebuttable presumption exists that
 14 27 official juvenile court records shall remain confidential. The
 14 28 bill provides that the court shall order the official juvenile
 14 29 court records in such a delinquency proceeding to be public
 14 30 records if either the public's interest in making the records
 14 31 public outweighs the juvenile's interest in maintaining the
 14 32 confidentiality of the records or the juvenile has been placed
 14 33 on youthful offender status pursuant to Code section 232.45(7)
 14 34 and Code section 907.3A(1), and will be transferred back to
 14 35 the district court for sentencing prior to the child's 18th
 15  1 birthday. The court may order the official juvenile court
 15  2 records in such a delinquency proceeding to be public records
 15  3 if the juvenile has been subsequently adjudicated delinquent
 15  4 for a public offense that would be a serious misdemeanor,
 15  5 aggravated misdemeanor, or felony offense if committed by an
 15  6 adult, or another delinquency proceeding is pending seeking
 15  7 such an adjudication. The bill provides that records subject
 15  8 to a public records order may be sealed at a later date
 15  9 pursuant to Code section 232.150.
 15 10    RIGHT TO REVIEW AND RELEASE A CONFIDENTIAL COMPLAINT.  The
 15 11 bill provides that delinquency complaints shall be released
 15 12 in accordance with Code section 915.25. Under current Code
 15 13 section 915.25, a complaint which alleges that a child who is
 15 14 at least 10 years of age committed a delinquent act, which if
 15 15 committed by an adult would be a public offense, is a public
 15 16 record. Current Code section 915.25 authorizes the court,
 15 17 its designee, or law enforcement officials to release such
 15 18 a complaint, including the identity of the child. The bill
 15 19 amends Code section 915.25 to provide that such a complaint
 15 20 is confidential unless the complaint alleges that the child
 15 21 committed a delinquent act that if committed by an adult would
 15 22 be a forcible felony. However, the bill authorizes state and
 15 23 local enforcement officials to release a confidential complaint
 15 24 against a child if the child is at large and doing so is deemed
 15 25 necessary for the protection of the public or the safety of
 15 26 the child. If the complaint is not confidential because the
 15 27 alleged delinquent act is an act that would be a forcible
 15 28 felony if committed by an adult, the court, its designee,
 15 29 or law enforcement officials may release such a complaint,
 15 30 including the identity of the child.
 15 31    The bill provides that an intake or juvenile court officer
 15 32 shall disclose to the alleged victim of a delinquent act, upon
 15 33 request, the complaint, the name and address of the child who
 15 34 allegedly committed the delinquent act, and the disposition
 15 35 of the complaint. If the alleged delinquent act would be
 16  1 a forcible felony if committed by an adult, the intake or
 16  2 juvenile court officer shall provide notification to the victim
 16  3 as required by Code section 915.24.
 16  4    SEALING OF JUVENILE COURT RECORDS UNAVAILABLE FOR
 16  5 OPERATING=WHILE=INTOXICATED VIOLATIONS.  Under current Code
 16  6 section 232.150, a court shall order juvenile court records
 16  7 to be sealed if the person who is the subject of the juvenile
 16  8 court records is 18 years of age or older and 2 years have
 16  9 elapsed since the last official action in the person's case,
 16 10 the person has not been subsequently convicted of a felony
 16 11 or an aggravated or serious misdemeanor or adjudicated a
 16 12 delinquent child for an act which if committed by an adult
 16 13 would be a felony, an aggravated misdemeanor, or a serious
 16 14 misdemeanor and no proceeding is pending seeking such
 16 15 conviction or adjudication, and the person was not placed on
 16 16 youthful offender status, transferred back to district court
 16 17 after the youthful offender's 18th birthday, and sentenced for
 16 18 the offense which precipitated the youthful offender placement.
 16 19 The bill in newly designated Code section 232.150(4) provides
 16 20 that the court shall not seal a person's juvenile court records
 16 21 if the person was adjudicated delinquent for violating Code
 16 22 section 321J.2, which prohibits the operation of a motor
 16 23 vehicle while under the influence of alcohol or a drug.
 16 24    RELEASE OF CONFIDENTIAL RECORDS.  The bill provides that a
 16 25 public record which is confidential under the provisions of
 16 26 Code chapter 232 shall only be subject to release upon order of
 16 27 a court in a proceeding under Code chapter 232.
 16 28    EXISTING CONFIDENTIALITY EXEMPTIONS.  The bill retains
 16 29 certain existing exemptions to confidentiality of juvenile
 16 30 court records. Pursuant to Code section 692A.121(8), records
 16 31 concerning sex offense convictions which are committed by
 16 32 minors may be released in the same manner as records of
 16 33 convictions of adults. Pursuant to Code section 915.10A,
 16 34 information concerning a juvenile charged with a felony offense
 16 35 may be released pursuant to an automated victim notification
 17  1 system. Under the bill, these exemptions to confidentiality
 17  2 are not amended and therefore still apply to juvenile court
 17  3 records.
 17  4    RIGHT TO COUNSEL.  The bill in Code section 232.11 provides
 17  5 that a child has the right to be represented by counsel at a
 17  6 hearing on a confidentiality order under Code section 232.149A
 17  7 or a public records order under Code section 232.149B.
 17  8    APPLICABILITY.  The bill applies to juvenile delinquency
 17  9 proceedings which are pending or arise on or after July 1,
 17 10 2016.

 10 29                           EXPLANATION
 10 30 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
 10 31 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
 10 32    This bill relates to the confidentiality of juvenile court
 10 33 records.
 10 34    CONFIDENTIALITY OF JUVENILE RECORDS.  Under current law,
 10 35 juvenile court records in cases alleging delinquency are public
 11  1 records unless a judge either grants a request to make the
 11  2 records confidential or seals the records. The bill in Code
 11  3 section 232.147(3) provides that juvenile court records are
 11  4 confidential and therefore are not public records except in
 11  5 cases alleging the commission of a delinquent act that would be
 11  6 a forcible felony if committed by an adult. Under Code section
 11  7 702.11, a forcible felony is any felonious child endangerment,
 11  8 assault, murder, sexual abuse, kidnapping, robbery, human
 11  9 trafficking, arson in the first degree, or burglary in the
 11 10 first degree. If juvenile records are not confidential, the
 11 11 bill provides that a juvenile court officer may release such
 11 12 records.
 11 13    CONFIDENTIALITY ORDERS.  The bill in Code section 232.149A
 11 14 provides that a court shall order juvenile court records
 11 15 alleging the commission of a delinquent act that would be a
 11 16 forcible felony if committed by an adult to be confidential
 11 17 if the court finds that the case has been dismissed and the
 11 18 person is no longer subject to the jurisdiction of the juvenile
 11 19 court and that the child's interest in making the records
 11 20 confidential outweighs the public's interest in the records
 11 21 remaining public records.
 11 22    ACCESS TO CONFIDENTIAL JUVENILE RECORDS.  The bill and
 11 23 Code section 232.147(3) provide that unless an order sealing
 11 24 confidential juvenile records has been entered, confidential
 11 25 juvenile records may still be inspected, without a court
 11 26 order, by the judge and professional court staff, including
 11 27 juvenile court officers; the child and the child's counsel;
 11 28 the child's parent, guardian or custodian, court appointed
 11 29 special advocate, and guardian ad litem, and the members of
 11 30 the child advocacy board created in Code section 237.16 or a
 11 31 local citizen foster care review board created in accordance
 11 32 with Code section 237.19 who are assigning or reviewing the
 11 33 child's case; the county attorney and the county attorney's
 11 34 assistants; an agency, association, facility, or institution
 11 35 which has custody of the child, or is legally responsible for
 12  1 the care, treatment, or supervision of the child, including
 12  2 the department of human services; a court, court professional
 12  3 staff, and adult probation officers in connection with the
 12  4 preparation of a presentence report concerning a person
 12  5 who prior thereto had been the subject of a juvenile court
 12  6 delinquency proceeding; the child's foster parent or an
 12  7 individual providing preadoptive care to the child; the state
 12  8 public defender; the department of corrections; a judicial
 12  9 district department of correctional services; the board of
 12 10 parole; the superintendent or the superintendent's designee of
 12 11 the school district for the school attended by the child or
 12 12 the authorities in charge of an accredited nonpublic school
 12 13 attended by the child; a member of the armed forces of the
 12 14 United States who is conducting a background investigation of
 12 15 an individual pursuant to federal law; the statistical analysis
 12 16 center for the purposes stated in Code section 216A.136; a
 12 17 state or local law enforcement agency; and the alleged victim
 12 18 of any delinquent act in the proceeding.
 12 19    The bill in newly designated Code section 232.147(3A)
 12 20 provides that juvenile court records containing a petition or
 12 21 complaint alleging the commission of a delinquent act that
 12 22 would be a forcible felony if committed by an adult shall be
 12 23 public records unless subject to a confidentiality order under
 12 24 Code section 232.149A or a sealing order under Code section
 12 25 232.150.  However, the bill provides that such official records
 12 26 shall not be available to the public or any governmental
 12 27 agency through the internet or in an electronic customized
 12 28 data report unless the child has been adjudicated delinquent
 12 29 in the matter.  Nevertheless, the bill provides that official
 12 30 juvenile court records may be disclosed without a court order
 12 31 through the internet or in an electronic customized data
 12 32 report prior to the child being adjudicated delinquent to the
 12 33 judge and professional court staff, including juvenile court
 12 34 officers; the child's counsel or guardian ad litem; the county
 12 35 attorney and the county attorney's assistants; a court, court
 13  1 professional staff, and adult probation officers in connection
 13  2 with the preparation of a presentence report concerning a
 13  3 person who prior thereto had been the subject of a juvenile
 13  4 court proceeding; a state or local law enforcement agency; the
 13  5 state public defender; the statistical analysis center for
 13  6 the purposes stated in Code section 216A.136; the department
 13  7 of human services; the department of corrections; a judicial
 13  8 district department of correctional services; and the board of
 13  9 parole.
 13 10    CONFIDENTIALITY OF TRANSCRIPTS.  The bill in newly
 13 11 designated Code section 232.147(3B) provides that if the court
 13 12 has excluded the public from a hearing pursuant to Code section
 13 13 232.39 or 232.92, the transcript of the proceedings shall not
 13 14 be deemed a public record and inspection and disclosure of
 13 15 the contents of the transcript shall not be permitted except
 13 16 pursuant to a court order or unless otherwise provided in Code
 13 17 chapter 232.
 13 18    USE OF ADJUDICATION OF DELINQUENCY FOR PENALTY ENHANCEMENTS
 13 19 OR EVIDENCE.  The bill in newly designated Code section
 13 20 232.147(13) provides that the confidentiality of a final
 13 21 adjudication of delinquency under Code section 232.147 or
 13 22 pursuant to Code section 232.149A shall not prohibit the state
 13 23 from pleading or proving the adjudication at a subsequent
 13 24 criminal or delinquency proceeding for the purpose of penalty
 13 25 enhancement when a provision of the Code specifically deems the
 13 26 delinquency adjudication to constitute a final conviction.
 13 27    The bill in newly designated Code section 232.147(14)
 13 28 provides that the provisions of the bill shall not be construed
 13 29 to limit or restrict the production, use, or introduction
 13 30 of official juvenile court records in any juvenile or adult
 13 31 criminal proceeding, where such records are relevant and deemed
 13 32 admissible under any other provision of the law.
 13 33    CONFIDENTIALITY OF RECORDS AND FILES OF CRIMINAL OR
 13 34 JUVENILE JUSTICE AGENCIES.  Under current law, records and
 13 35 files of a criminal or juvenile justice agency concerning
 14  1 a child involved in a delinquent act are public records,
 14  2 subject to certain exceptions. The bill in Code section
 14  3 232.149 provides that the records and files of a criminal or
 14  4 juvenile justice agency, an intake officer, or a juvenile court
 14  5 officer concerning a child involved in a delinquent act are
 14  6 confidential. The bill further provides that the records of an
 14  7 intake officer or juvenile court officer containing a dismissal
 14  8 of a complaint or an informal adjustment of a complaint when
 14  9 no petition is filed relating to the complaint, shall not be
 14 10 available to the public, but may be disclosed to the judge and
 14 11 professional court staff, including juvenile court officers;
 14 12 the child's counsel or guardian ad litem; the county attorney
 14 13 and county attorney's assistants;  the superintendent or the
 14 14 superintendent's designee of the school district for the
 14 15 school attended by the child or the authorities in charge of
 14 16 an accredited nonpublic school attended by the child; a member
 14 17 of the armed forces of the United States who is conducting a
 14 18 background investigation of an individual pursuant to federal
 14 19 law; the statistical analysis center for the purposes stated
 14 20 in Code section 216A.136; the state public defender;  the
 14 21 department of human services; and the alleged victim of the
 14 22 delinquent act.
 14 23    PUBLIC RECORDS HEARINGS.  The bill enacts new Code section
 14 24 232.149B, which provides that a person may apply for a court
 14 25 order to make confidential juvenile court records public.
 14 26 The bill provides that a rebuttable presumption exists that
 14 27 official juvenile court records shall remain confidential. The
 14 28 bill provides that the court shall order the official juvenile
 14 29 court records in such a delinquency proceeding to be public
 14 30 records if either the public's interest in making the records
 14 31 public outweighs the juvenile's interest in maintaining the
 14 32 confidentiality of the records or the juvenile has been placed
 14 33 on youthful offender status pursuant to Code section 232.45(7)
 14 34 and Code section 907.3A(1), and will be transferred back to
 14 35 the district court for sentencing prior to the child's 18th
 15  1 birthday. The court may order the official juvenile court
 15  2 records in such a delinquency proceeding to be public records
 15  3 if the juvenile has been subsequently adjudicated delinquent
 15  4 for a public offense that would be a serious misdemeanor,
 15  5 aggravated misdemeanor, or felony offense if committed by an
 15  6 adult, or another delinquency proceeding is pending seeking
 15  7 such an adjudication. The bill provides that records subject
 15  8 to a public records order may be sealed at a later date
 15  9 pursuant to Code section 232.150.
 15 10    RIGHT TO REVIEW AND RELEASE A CONFIDENTIAL COMPLAINT.  The
 15 11 bill provides that delinquency complaints shall be released
 15 12 in accordance with Code section 915.25. Under current Code
 15 13 section 915.25, a complaint which alleges that a child who is
 15 14 at least 10 years of age committed a delinquent act, which if
 15 15 committed by an adult would be a public offense, is a public
 15 16 record. Current Code section 915.25 authorizes the court,
 15 17 its designee, or law enforcement officials to release such
 15 18 a complaint, including the identity of the child. The bill
 15 19 amends Code section 915.25 to provide that such a complaint
 15 20 is confidential unless the complaint alleges that the child
 15 21 committed a delinquent act that if committed by an adult would
 15 22 be a forcible felony. However, the bill authorizes state and
 15 23 local enforcement officials to release a confidential complaint
 15 24 against a child if the child is at large and doing so is deemed
 15 25 necessary for the protection of the public or the safety of
 15 26 the child. If the complaint is not confidential because the
 15 27 alleged delinquent act is an act that would be a forcible
 15 28 felony if committed by an adult, the court, its designee,
 15 29 or law enforcement officials may release such a complaint,
 15 30 including the identity of the child.
 15 31    The bill provides that an intake or juvenile court officer
 15 32 shall disclose to the alleged victim of a delinquent act, upon
 15 33 request, the complaint, the name and address of the child who
 15 34 allegedly committed the delinquent act, and the disposition
 15 35 of the complaint. If the alleged delinquent act would be
 16  1 a forcible felony if committed by an adult, the intake or
 16  2 juvenile court officer shall provide notification to the victim
 16  3 as required by Code section 915.24.
 16  4    SEALING OF JUVENILE COURT RECORDS UNAVAILABLE FOR
 16  5 OPERATING=WHILE=INTOXICATED VIOLATIONS.  Under current Code
 16  6 section 232.150, a court shall order juvenile court records
 16  7 to be sealed if the person who is the subject of the juvenile
 16  8 court records is 18 years of age or older and 2 years have
 16  9 elapsed since the last official action in the person's case,
 16 10 the person has not been subsequently convicted of a felony
 16 11 or an aggravated or serious misdemeanor or adjudicated a
 16 12 delinquent child for an act which if committed by an adult
 16 13 would be a felony, an aggravated misdemeanor, or a serious
 16 14 misdemeanor and no proceeding is pending seeking such
 16 15 conviction or adjudication, and the person was not placed on
 16 16 youthful offender status, transferred back to district court
 16 17 after the youthful offender's 18th birthday, and sentenced for
 16 18 the offense which precipitated the youthful offender placement.
 16 19 The bill in newly designated Code section 232.150(4) provides
 16 20 that the court shall not seal a person's juvenile court records
 16 21 if the person was adjudicated delinquent for violating Code
 16 22 section 321J.2, which prohibits the operation of a motor
 16 23 vehicle while under the influence of alcohol or a drug.
 16 24    RELEASE OF CONFIDENTIAL RECORDS.  The bill provides that a
 16 25 public record which is confidential under the provisions of
 16 26 Code chapter 232 shall only be subject to release upon order of
 16 27 a court in a proceeding under Code chapter 232.
 16 28    EXISTING CONFIDENTIALITY EXEMPTIONS.  The bill retains
 16 29 certain existing exemptions to confidentiality of juvenile
 16 30 court records. Pursuant to Code section 692A.121(8), records
 16 31 concerning sex offense convictions which are committed by
 16 32 minors may be released in the same manner as records of
 16 33 convictions of adults. Pursuant to Code section 915.10A,
 16 34 information concerning a juvenile charged with a felony offense
 16 35 may be released pursuant to an automated victim notification
 17  1 system. Under the bill, these exemptions to confidentiality
 17  2 are not amended and therefore still apply to juvenile court
 17  3 records.
 17  4    RIGHT TO COUNSEL.  The bill in Code section 232.11 provides
 17  5 that a child has the right to be represented by counsel at a
 17  6 hearing on a confidentiality order under Code section 232.149A
 17  7 or a public records order under Code section 232.149B.
 17  8    APPLICABILITY.  The bill applies to juvenile delinquency
 17  9 proceedings which are pending or arise on or after July 1,
 17 10 2016.

 10 31 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
 10 32    This bill relates to the confidentiality of juvenile court
 10 33 records.
 10 34    CONFIDENTIALITY OF JUVENILE RECORDS.  Under current law,
 10 35 juvenile court records in cases alleging delinquency are public
 11  1 records unless a judge either grants a request to make the
 11  2 records confidential or seals the records. The bill in Code
 11  3 section 232.147(3) provides that juvenile court records are
 11  4 confidential and therefore are not public records except in
 11  5 cases alleging the commission of a delinquent act that would be
 11  6 a forcible felony if committed by an adult. Under Code section
 11  7 702.11, a forcible felony is any felonious child endangerment,
 11  8 assault, murder, sexual abuse, kidnapping, robbery, human
 11  9 trafficking, arson in the first degree, or burglary in the
 11 10 first degree. If juvenile records are not confidential, the
 11 11 bill provides that a juvenile court officer may release such
 11 12 records.
 11 13    CONFIDENTIALITY ORDERS.  The bill in Code section 232.149A
 11 14 provides that a court shall order juvenile court records
 11 15 alleging the commission of a delinquent act that would be a
 11 16 forcible felony if committed by an adult to be confidential
 11 17 if the court finds that the case has been dismissed and the
 11 18 person is no longer subject to the jurisdiction of the juvenile
 11 19 court and that the child's interest in making the records
 11 20 confidential outweighs the public's interest in the records
 11 21 remaining public records.
 11 22    ACCESS TO CONFIDENTIAL JUVENILE RECORDS.  The bill and
 11 23 Code section 232.147(3) provide that unless an order sealing
 11 24 confidential juvenile records has been entered, confidential
 11 25 juvenile records may still be inspected, without a court
 11 26 order, by the judge and professional court staff, including
 11 27 juvenile court officers; the child and the child's counsel;
 11 28 the child's parent, guardian or custodian, court appointed
 11 29 special advocate, and guardian ad litem, and the members of
 11 30 the child advocacy board created in Code section 237.16 or a
 11 31 local citizen foster care review board created in accordance
 11 32 with Code section 237.19 who are assigning or reviewing the
 11 33 child's case; the county attorney and the county attorney's
 11 34 assistants; an agency, association, facility, or institution
 11 35 which has custody of the child, or is legally responsible for
 12  1 the care, treatment, or supervision of the child, including
 12  2 the department of human services; a court, court professional
 12  3 staff, and adult probation officers in connection with the
 12  4 preparation of a presentence report concerning a person
 12  5 who prior thereto had been the subject of a juvenile court
 12  6 delinquency proceeding; the child's foster parent or an
 12  7 individual providing preadoptive care to the child; the state
 12  8 public defender; the department of corrections; a judicial
 12  9 district department of correctional services; the board of
 12 10 parole; the superintendent or the superintendent's designee of
 12 11 the school district for the school attended by the child or
 12 12 the authorities in charge of an accredited nonpublic school
 12 13 attended by the child; a member of the armed forces of the
 12 14 United States who is conducting a background investigation of
 12 15 an individual pursuant to federal law; the statistical analysis
 12 16 center for the purposes stated in Code section 216A.136; a
 12 17 state or local law enforcement agency; and the alleged victim
 12 18 of any delinquent act in the proceeding.
 12 19    The bill in newly designated Code section 232.147(3A)
 12 20 provides that juvenile court records containing a petition or
 12 21 complaint alleging the commission of a delinquent act that
 12 22 would be a forcible felony if committed by an adult shall be
 12 23 public records unless subject to a confidentiality order under
 12 24 Code section 232.149A or a sealing order under Code section
 12 25 232.150.  However, the bill provides that such official records
 12 26 shall not be available to the public or any governmental
 12 27 agency through the internet or in an electronic customized
 12 28 data report unless the child has been adjudicated delinquent
 12 29 in the matter.  Nevertheless, the bill provides that official
 12 30 juvenile court records may be disclosed without a court order
 12 31 through the internet or in an electronic customized data
 12 32 report prior to the child being adjudicated delinquent to the
 12 33 judge and professional court staff, including juvenile court
 12 34 officers; the child's counsel or guardian ad litem; the county
 12 35 attorney and the county attorney's assistants; a court, court
 13  1 professional staff, and adult probation officers in connection
 13  2 with the preparation of a presentence report concerning a
 13  3 person who prior thereto had been the subject of a juvenile
 13  4 court proceeding; a state or local law enforcement agency; the
 13  5 state public defender; the statistical analysis center for
 13  6 the purposes stated in Code section 216A.136; the department
 13  7 of human services; the department of corrections; a judicial
 13  8 district department of correctional services; and the board of
 13  9 parole.
 13 10    CONFIDENTIALITY OF TRANSCRIPTS.  The bill in newly
 13 11 designated Code section 232.147(3B) provides that if the court
 13 12 has excluded the public from a hearing pursuant to Code section
 13 13 232.39 or 232.92, the transcript of the proceedings shall not
 13 14 be deemed a public record and inspection and disclosure of
 13 15 the contents of the transcript shall not be permitted except
 13 16 pursuant to a court order or unless otherwise provided in Code
 13 17 chapter 232.
 13 18    USE OF ADJUDICATION OF DELINQUENCY FOR PENALTY ENHANCEMENTS
 13 19 OR EVIDENCE.  The bill in newly designated Code section
 13 20 232.147(13) provides that the confidentiality of a final
 13 21 adjudication of delinquency under Code section 232.147 or
 13 22 pursuant to Code section 232.149A shall not prohibit the state
 13 23 from pleading or proving the adjudication at a subsequent
 13 24 criminal or delinquency proceeding for the purpose of penalty
 13 25 enhancement when a provision of the Code specifically deems the
 13 26 delinquency adjudication to constitute a final conviction.
 13 27    The bill in newly designated Code section 232.147(14)
 13 28 provides that the provisions of the bill shall not be construed
 13 29 to limit or restrict the production, use, or introduction
 13 30 of official juvenile court records in any juvenile or adult
 13 31 criminal proceeding, where such records are relevant and deemed
 13 32 admissible under any other provision of the law.
 13 33    CONFIDENTIALITY OF RECORDS AND FILES OF CRIMINAL OR
 13 34 JUVENILE JUSTICE AGENCIES.  Under current law, records and
 13 35 files of a criminal or juvenile justice agency concerning
 14  1 a child involved in a delinquent act are public records,
 14  2 subject to certain exceptions. The bill in Code section
 14  3 232.149 provides that the records and files of a criminal or
 14  4 juvenile justice agency, an intake officer, or a juvenile court
 14  5 officer concerning a child involved in a delinquent act are
 14  6 confidential. The bill further provides that the records of an
 14  7 intake officer or juvenile court officer containing a dismissal
 14  8 of a complaint or an informal adjustment of a complaint when
 14  9 no petition is filed relating to the complaint, shall not be
 14 10 available to the public, but may be disclosed to the judge and
 14 11 professional court staff, including juvenile court officers;
 14 12 the child's counsel or guardian ad litem; the county attorney
 14 13 and county attorney's assistants;  the superintendent or the
 14 14 superintendent's designee of the school district for the
 14 15 school attended by the child or the authorities in charge of
 14 16 an accredited nonpublic school attended by the child; a member
 14 17 of the armed forces of the United States who is conducting a
 14 18 background investigation of an individual pursuant to federal
 14 19 law; the statistical analysis center for the purposes stated
 14 20 in Code section 216A.136; the state public defender;  the
 14 21 department of human services; and the alleged victim of the
 14 22 delinquent act.
 14 23    PUBLIC RECORDS HEARINGS.  The bill enacts new Code section
 14 24 232.149B, which provides that a person may apply for a court
 14 25 order to make confidential juvenile court records public.
 14 26 The bill provides that a rebuttable presumption exists that
 14 27 official juvenile court records shall remain confidential. The
 14 28 bill provides that the court shall order the official juvenile
 14 29 court records in such a delinquency proceeding to be public
 14 30 records if either the public's interest in making the records
 14 31 public outweighs the juvenile's interest in maintaining the
 14 32 confidentiality of the records or the juvenile has been placed
 14 33 on youthful offender status pursuant to Code section 232.45(7)
 14 34 and Code section 907.3A(1), and will be transferred back to
 14 35 the district court for sentencing prior to the child's 18th
 15  1 birthday. The court may order the official juvenile court
 15  2 records in such a delinquency proceeding to be public records
 15  3 if the juvenile has been subsequently adjudicated delinquent
 15  4 for a public offense that would be a serious misdemeanor,
 15  5 aggravated misdemeanor, or felony offense if committed by an
 15  6 adult, or another delinquency proceeding is pending seeking
 15  7 such an adjudication. The bill provides that records subject
 15  8 to a public records order may be sealed at a later date
 15  9 pursuant to Code section 232.150.
 15 10    RIGHT TO REVIEW AND RELEASE A CONFIDENTIAL COMPLAINT.  The
 15 11 bill provides that delinquency complaints shall be released
 15 12 in accordance with Code section 915.25. Under current Code
 15 13 section 915.25, a complaint which alleges that a child who is
 15 14 at least 10 years of age committed a delinquent act, which if
 15 15 committed by an adult would be a public offense, is a public
 15 16 record. Current Code section 915.25 authorizes the court,
 15 17 its designee, or law enforcement officials to release such
 15 18 a complaint, including the identity of the child. The bill
 15 19 amends Code section 915.25 to provide that such a complaint
 15 20 is confidential unless the complaint alleges that the child
 15 21 committed a delinquent act that if committed by an adult would
 15 22 be a forcible felony. However, the bill authorizes state and
 15 23 local enforcement officials to release a confidential complaint
 15 24 against a child if the child is at large and doing so is deemed
 15 25 necessary for the protection of the public or the safety of
 15 26 the child. If the complaint is not confidential because the
 15 27 alleged delinquent act is an act that would be a forcible
 15 28 felony if committed by an adult, the court, its designee,
 15 29 or law enforcement officials may release such a complaint,
 15 30 including the identity of the child.
 15 31    The bill provides that an intake or juvenile court officer
 15 32 shall disclose to the alleged victim of a delinquent act, upon
 15 33 request, the complaint, the name and address of the child who
 15 34 allegedly committed the delinquent act, and the disposition
 15 35 of the complaint. If the alleged delinquent act would be
 16  1 a forcible felony if committed by an adult, the intake or
 16  2 juvenile court officer shall provide notification to the victim
 16  3 as required by Code section 915.24.
 16  4    SEALING OF JUVENILE COURT RECORDS UNAVAILABLE FOR
 16  5 OPERATING=WHILE=INTOXICATED VIOLATIONS.  Under current Code
 16  6 section 232.150, a court shall order juvenile court records
 16  7 to be sealed if the person who is the subject of the juvenile
 16  8 court records is 18 years of age or older and 2 years have
 16  9 elapsed since the last official action in the person's case,
 16 10 the person has not been subsequently convicted of a felony
 16 11 or an aggravated or serious misdemeanor or adjudicated a
 16 12 delinquent child for an act which if committed by an adult
 16 13 would be a felony, an aggravated misdemeanor, or a serious
 16 14 misdemeanor and no proceeding is pending seeking such
 16 15 conviction or adjudication, and the person was not placed on
 16 16 youthful offender status, transferred back to district court
 16 17 after the youthful offender's 18th birthday, and sentenced for
 16 18 the offense which precipitated the youthful offender placement.
 16 19 The bill in newly designated Code section 232.150(4) provides
 16 20 that the court shall not seal a person's juvenile court records
 16 21 if the person was adjudicated delinquent for violating Code
 16 22 section 321J.2, which prohibits the operation of a motor
 16 23 vehicle while under the influence of alcohol or a drug.
 16 24    RELEASE OF CONFIDENTIAL RECORDS.  The bill provides that a
 16 25 public record which is confidential under the provisions of
 16 26 Code chapter 232 shall only be subject to release upon order of
 16 27 a court in a proceeding under Code chapter 232.
 16 28    EXISTING CONFIDENTIALITY EXEMPTIONS.  The bill retains
 16 29 certain existing exemptions to confidentiality of juvenile
 16 30 court records. Pursuant to Code section 692A.121(8), records
 16 31 concerning sex offense convictions which are committed by
 16 32 minors may be released in the same manner as records of
 16 33 convictions of adults. Pursuant to Code section 915.10A,
 16 34 information concerning a juvenile charged with a felony offense
 16 35 may be released pursuant to an automated victim notification
 17  1 system. Under the bill, these exemptions to confidentiality
 17  2 are not amended and therefore still apply to juvenile court
 17  3 records.
 17  4    RIGHT TO COUNSEL.  The bill in Code section 232.11 provides
 17  5 that a child has the right to be represented by counsel at a
 17  6 hearing on a confidentiality order under Code section 232.149A
 17  7 or a public records order under Code section 232.149B.
 17  8    APPLICABILITY.  The bill applies to juvenile delinquency
 17  9 proceedings which are pending or arise on or after July 1,
 17 10 2016.

 10 30 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
 10 31 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
 10 32    This bill relates to the confidentiality of juvenile court
 10 33 records.
 10 34    CONFIDENTIALITY OF JUVENILE RECORDS.  Under current law,
 10 35 juvenile court records in cases alleging delinquency are public
 11  1 records unless a judge either grants a request to make the
 11  2 records confidential or seals the records. The bill in Code
 11  3 section 232.147(3) provides that juvenile court records are
 11  4 confidential and therefore are not public records except in
 11  5 cases alleging the commission of a delinquent act that would be
 11  6 a forcible felony if committed by an adult. Under Code section
 11  7 702.11, a forcible felony is any felonious child endangerment,
 11  8 assault, murder, sexual abuse, kidnapping, robbery, human
 11  9 trafficking, arson in the first degree, or burglary in the
 11 10 first degree. If juvenile records are not confidential, the
 11 11 bill provides that a juvenile court officer may release such
 11 12 records.
 11 13    CONFIDENTIALITY ORDERS.  The bill in Code section 232.149A
 11 14 provides that a court shall order juvenile court records
 11 15 alleging the commission of a delinquent act that would be a
 11 16 forcible felony if committed by an adult to be confidential
 11 17 if the court finds that the case has been dismissed and the
 11 18 person is no longer subject to the jurisdiction of the juvenile
 11 19 court and that the child's interest in making the records
 11 20 confidential outweighs the public's interest in the records
 11 21 remaining public records.
 11 22    ACCESS TO CONFIDENTIAL JUVENILE RECORDS.  The bill and
 11 23 Code section 232.147(3) provide that unless an order sealing
 11 24 confidential juvenile records has been entered, confidential
 11 25 juvenile records may still be inspected, without a court
 11 26 order, by the judge and professional court staff, including
 11 27 juvenile court officers; the child and the child's counsel;
 11 28 the child's parent, guardian or custodian, court appointed
 11 29 special advocate, and guardian ad litem, and the members of
 11 30 the child advocacy board created in Code section 237.16 or a
 11 31 local citizen foster care review board created in accordance
 11 32 with Code section 237.19 who are assigning or reviewing the
 11 33 child's case; the county attorney and the county attorney's
 11 34 assistants; an agency, association, facility, or institution
 11 35 which has custody of the child, or is legally responsible for
 12  1 the care, treatment, or supervision of the child, including
 12  2 the department of human services; a court, court professional
 12  3 staff, and adult probation officers in connection with the
 12  4 preparation of a presentence report concerning a person
 12  5 who prior thereto had been the subject of a juvenile court
 12  6 delinquency proceeding; the child's foster parent or an
 12  7 individual providing preadoptive care to the child; the state
 12  8 public defender; the department of corrections; a judicial
 12  9 district department of correctional services; the board of
 12 10 parole; the superintendent or the superintendent's designee of
 12 11 the school district for the school attended by the child or
 12 12 the authorities in charge of an accredited nonpublic school
 12 13 attended by the child; a member of the armed forces of the
 12 14 United States who is conducting a background investigation of
 12 15 an individual pursuant to federal law; the statistical analysis
 12 16 center for the purposes stated in Code section 216A.136; a
 12 17 state or local law enforcement agency; and the alleged victim
 12 18 of any delinquent act in the proceeding.
 12 19    The bill in newly designated Code section 232.147(3A)
 12 20 provides that juvenile court records containing a petition or
 12 21 complaint alleging the commission of a delinquent act that
 12 22 would be a forcible felony if committed by an adult shall be
 12 23 public records unless subject to a confidentiality order under
 12 24 Code section 232.149A or a sealing order under Code section
 12 25 232.150.  However, the bill provides that such official records
 12 26 shall not be available to the public or any governmental
 12 27 agency through the internet or in an electronic customized
 12 28 data report unless the child has been adjudicated delinquent
 12 29 in the matter.  Nevertheless, the bill provides that official
 12 30 juvenile court records may be disclosed without a court order
 12 31 through the internet or in an electronic customized data
 12 32 report prior to the child being adjudicated delinquent to the
 12 33 judge and professional court staff, including juvenile court
 12 34 officers; the child's counsel or guardian ad litem; the county
 12 35 attorney and the county attorney's assistants; a court, court
 13  1 professional staff, and adult probation officers in connection
 13  2 with the preparation of a presentence report concerning a
 13  3 person who prior thereto had been the subject of a juvenile
 13  4 court proceeding; a state or local law enforcement agency; the
 13  5 state public defender; the statistical analysis center for
 13  6 the purposes stated in Code section 216A.136; the department
 13  7 of human services; the department of corrections; a judicial
 13  8 district department of correctional services; and the board of
 13  9 parole.
 13 10    CONFIDENTIALITY OF TRANSCRIPTS.  The bill in newly
 13 11 designated Code section 232.147(3B) provides that if the court
 13 12 has excluded the public from a hearing pursuant to Code section
 13 13 232.39 or 232.92, the transcript of the proceedings shall not
 13 14 be deemed a public record and inspection and disclosure of
 13 15 the contents of the transcript shall not be permitted except
 13 16 pursuant to a court order or unless otherwise provided in Code
 13 17 chapter 232.
 13 18    USE OF ADJUDICATION OF DELINQUENCY FOR PENALTY ENHANCEMENTS
 13 19 OR EVIDENCE.  The bill in newly designated Code section
 13 20 232.147(13) provides that the confidentiality of a final
 13 21 adjudication of delinquency under Code section 232.147 or
 13 22 pursuant to Code section 232.149A shall not prohibit the state
 13 23 from pleading or proving the adjudication at a subsequent
 13 24 criminal or delinquency proceeding for the purpose of penalty
 13 25 enhancement when a provision of the Code specifically deems the
 13 26 delinquency adjudication to constitute a final conviction.
 13 27    The bill in newly designated Code section 232.147(14)
 13 28 provides that the provisions of the bill shall not be construed
 13 29 to limit or restrict the production, use, or introduction
 13 30 of official juvenile court records in any juvenile or adult
 13 31 criminal proceeding, where such records are relevant and deemed
 13 32 admissible under any other provision of the law.
 13 33    CONFIDENTIALITY OF RECORDS AND FILES OF CRIMINAL OR
 13 34 JUVENILE JUSTICE AGENCIES.  Under current law, records and
 13 35 files of a criminal or juvenile justice agency concerning
 14  1 a child involved in a delinquent act are public records,
 14  2 subject to certain exceptions. The bill in Code section
 14  3 232.149 provides that the records and files of a criminal or
 14  4 juvenile justice agency, an intake officer, or a juvenile court
 14  5 officer concerning a child involved in a delinquent act are
 14  6 confidential. The bill further provides that the records of an
 14  7 intake officer or juvenile court officer containing a dismissal
 14  8 of a complaint or an informal adjustment of a complaint when
 14  9 no petition is filed relating to the complaint, shall not be
 14 10 available to the public, but may be disclosed to the judge and
 14 11 professional court staff, including juvenile court officers;
 14 12 the child's counsel or guardian ad litem; the county attorney
 14 13 and county attorney's assistants;  the superintendent or the
 14 14 superintendent's designee of the school district for the
 14 15 school attended by the child or the authorities in charge of
 14 16 an accredited nonpublic school attended by the child; a member
 14 17 of the armed forces of the United States who is conducting a
 14 18 background investigation of an individual pursuant to federal
 14 19 law; the statistical analysis center for the purposes stated
 14 20 in Code section 216A.136; the state public defender;  the
 14 21 department of human services; and the alleged victim of the
 14 22 delinquent act.
 14 23    PUBLIC RECORDS HEARINGS.  The bill enacts new Code section
 14 24 232.149B, which provides that a person may apply for a court
 14 25 order to make confidential juvenile court records public.
 14 26 The bill provides that a rebuttable presumption exists that
 14 27 official juvenile court records shall remain confidential. The
 14 28 bill provides that the court shall order the official juvenile
 14 29 court records in such a delinquency proceeding to be public
 14 30 records if either the public's interest in making the records
 14 31 public outweighs the juvenile's interest in maintaining the
 14 32 confidentiality of the records or the juvenile has been placed
 14 33 on youthful offender status pursuant to Code section 232.45(7)
 14 34 and Code section 907.3A(1), and will be transferred back to
 14 35 the district court for sentencing prior to the child's 18th
 15  1 birthday. The court may order the official juvenile court
 15  2 records in such a delinquency proceeding to be public records
 15  3 if the juvenile has been subsequently adjudicated delinquent
 15  4 for a public offense that would be a serious misdemeanor,
 15  5 aggravated misdemeanor, or felony offense if committed by an
 15  6 adult, or another delinquency proceeding is pending seeking
 15  7 such an adjudication. The bill provides that records subject
 15  8 to a public records order may be sealed at a later date
 15  9 pursuant to Code section 232.150.
 15 10    RIGHT TO REVIEW AND RELEASE A CONFIDENTIAL COMPLAINT.  The
 15 11 bill provides that delinquency complaints shall be released
 15 12 in accordance with Code section 915.25. Under current Code
 15 13 section 915.25, a complaint which alleges that a child who is
 15 14 at least 10 years of age committed a delinquent act, which if
 15 15 committed by an adult would be a public offense, is a public
 15 16 record. Current Code section 915.25 authorizes the court,
 15 17 its designee, or law enforcement officials to release such
 15 18 a complaint, including the identity of the child. The bill
 15 19 amends Code section 915.25 to provide that such a complaint
 15 20 is confidential unless the complaint alleges that the child
 15 21 committed a delinquent act that if committed by an adult would
 15 22 be a forcible felony. However, the bill authorizes state and
 15 23 local enforcement officials to release a confidential complaint
 15 24 against a child if the child is at large and doing so is deemed
 15 25 necessary for the protection of the public or the safety of
 15 26 the child. If the complaint is not confidential because the
 15 27 alleged delinquent act is an act that would be a forcible
 15 28 felony if committed by an adult, the court, its designee,
 15 29 or law enforcement officials may release such a complaint,
 15 30 including the identity of the child.
 15 31    The bill provides that an intake or juvenile court officer
 15 32 shall disclose to the alleged victim of a delinquent act, upon
 15 33 request, the complaint, the name and address of the child who
 15 34 allegedly committed the delinquent act, and the disposition
 15 35 of the complaint. If the alleged delinquent act would be
 16  1 a forcible felony if committed by an adult, the intake or
 16  2 juvenile court officer shall provide notification to the victim
 16  3 as required by Code section 915.24.
 16  4    SEALING OF JUVENILE COURT RECORDS UNAVAILABLE FOR
 16  5 OPERATING=WHILE=INTOXICATED VIOLATIONS.  Under current Code
 16  6 section 232.150, a court shall order juvenile court records
 16  7 to be sealed if the person who is the subject of the juvenile
 16  8 court records is 18 years of age or older and 2 years have
 16  9 elapsed since the last official action in the person's case,
 16 10 the person has not been subsequently convicted of a felony
 16 11 or an aggravated or serious misdemeanor or adjudicated a
 16 12 delinquent child for an act which if committed by an adult
 16 13 would be a felony, an aggravated misdemeanor, or a serious
 16 14 misdemeanor and no proceeding is pending seeking such
 16 15 conviction or adjudication, and the person was not placed on
 16 16 youthful offender status, transferred back to district court
 16 17 after the youthful offender's 18th birthday, and sentenced for
 16 18 the offense which precipitated the youthful offender placement.
 16 19 The bill in newly designated Code section 232.150(4) provides
 16 20 that the court shall not seal a person's juvenile court records
 16 21 if the person was adjudicated delinquent for violating Code
 16 22 section 321J.2, which prohibits the operation of a motor
 16 23 vehicle while under the influence of alcohol or a drug.
 16 24    RELEASE OF CONFIDENTIAL RECORDS.  The bill provides that a
 16 25 public record which is confidential under the provisions of
 16 26 Code chapter 232 shall only be subject to release upon order of
 16 27 a court in a proceeding under Code chapter 232.
 16 28    EXISTING CONFIDENTIALITY EXEMPTIONS.  The bill retains
 16 29 certain existing exemptions to confidentiality of juvenile
 16 30 court records. Pursuant to Code section 692A.121(8), records
 16 31 concerning sex offense convictions which are committed by
 16 32 minors may be released in the same manner as records of
 16 33 convictions of adults. Pursuant to Code section 915.10A,
 16 34 information concerning a juvenile charged with a felony offense
 16 35 may be released pursuant to an automated victim notification
 17  1 system. Under the bill, these exemptions to confidentiality
 17  2 are not amended and therefore still apply to juvenile court
 17  3 records.
 17  4    RIGHT TO COUNSEL.  The bill in Code section 232.11 provides
 17  5 that a child has the right to be represented by counsel at a
 17  6 hearing on a confidentiality order under Code section 232.149A
 17  7 or a public records order under Code section 232.149B.
 17  8    APPLICABILITY.  The bill applies to juvenile delinquency
 17  9 proceedings which are pending or arise on or after July 1,
 17 10 2016.

 10 31 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
 10 32    This bill relates to the confidentiality of juvenile court
 10 33 records.
 10 34    CONFIDENTIALITY OF JUVENILE RECORDS.  Under current law,
 10 35 juvenile court records in cases alleging delinquency are public
 11  1 records unless a judge either grants a request to make the
 11  2 records confidential or seals the records. The bill in Code
 11  3 section 232.147(3) provides that juvenile court records are
 11  4 confidential and therefore are not public records except in
 11  5 cases alleging the commission of a delinquent act that would be
 11  6 a forcible felony if committed by an adult. Under Code section
 11  7 702.11, a forcible felony is any felonious child endangerment,
 11  8 assault, murder, sexual abuse, kidnapping, robbery, human
 11  9 trafficking, arson in the first degree, or burglary in the
 11 10 first degree. If juvenile records are not confidential, the
 11 11 bill provides that a juvenile court officer may release such
 11 12 records.
 11 13    CONFIDENTIALITY ORDERS.  The bill in Code section 232.149A
 11 14 provides that a court shall order juvenile court records
 11 15 alleging the commission of a delinquent act that would be a
 11 16 forcible felony if committed by an adult to be confidential
 11 17 if the court finds that the case has been dismissed and the
 11 18 person is no longer subject to the jurisdiction of the juvenile
 11 19 court and that the child's interest in making the records
 11 20 confidential outweighs the public's interest in the records
 11 21 remaining public records.
 11 22    ACCESS TO CONFIDENTIAL JUVENILE RECORDS.  The bill and
 11 23 Code section 232.147(3) provide that unless an order sealing
 11 24 confidential juvenile records has been entered, confidential
 11 25 juvenile records may still be inspected, without a court
 11 26 order, by the judge and professional court staff, including
 11 27 juvenile court officers; the child and the child's counsel;
 11 28 the child's parent, guardian or custodian, court appointed
 11 29 special advocate, and guardian ad litem, and the members of
 11 30 the child advocacy board created in Code section 237.16 or a
 11 31 local citizen foster care review board created in accordance
 11 32 with Code section 237.19 who are assigning or reviewing the
 11 33 child's case; the county attorney and the county attorney's
 11 34 assistants; an agency, association, facility, or institution
 11 35 which has custody of the child, or is legally responsible for
 12  1 the care, treatment, or supervision of the child, including
 12  2 the department of human services; a court, court professional
 12  3 staff, and adult probation officers in connection with the
 12  4 preparation of a presentence report concerning a person
 12  5 who prior thereto had been the subject of a juvenile court
 12  6 delinquency proceeding; the child's foster parent or an
 12  7 individual providing preadoptive care to the child; the state
 12  8 public defender; the department of corrections; a judicial
 12  9 district department of correctional services; the board of
 12 10 parole; the superintendent or the superintendent's designee of
 12 11 the school district for the school attended by the child or
 12 12 the authorities in charge of an accredited nonpublic school
 12 13 attended by the child; a member of the armed forces of the
 12 14 United States who is conducting a background investigation of
 12 15 an individual pursuant to federal law; the statistical analysis
 12 16 center for the purposes stated in Code section 216A.136; a
 12 17 state or local law enforcement agency; and the alleged victim
 12 18 of any delinquent act in the proceeding.
 12 19    The bill in newly designated Code section 232.147(3A)
 12 20 provides that juvenile court records containing a petition or
 12 21 complaint alleging the commission of a delinquent act that
 12 22 would be a forcible felony if committed by an adult shall be
 12 23 public records unless subject to a confidentiality order under
 12 24 Code section 232.149A or a sealing order under Code section
 12 25 232.150.  However, the bill provides that such official records
 12 26 shall not be available to the public or any governmental
 12 27 agency through the internet or in an electronic customized
 12 28 data report unless the child has been adjudicated delinquent
 12 29 in the matter.  Nevertheless, the bill provides that official
 12 30 juvenile court records may be disclosed without a court order
 12 31 through the internet or in an electronic customized data
 12 32 report prior to the child being adjudicated delinquent to the
 12 33 judge and professional court staff, including juvenile court
 12 34 officers; the child's counsel or guardian ad litem; the county
 12 35 attorney and the county attorney's assistants; a court, court
 13  1 professional staff, and adult probation officers in connection
 13  2 with the preparation of a presentence report concerning a
 13  3 person who prior thereto had been the subject of a juvenile
 13  4 court proceeding; a state or local law enforcement agency; the
 13  5 state public defender; the statistical analysis center for
 13  6 the purposes stated in Code section 216A.136; the department
 13  7 of human services; the department of corrections; a judicial
 13  8 district department of correctional services; and the board of
 13  9 parole.
 13 10    CONFIDENTIALITY OF TRANSCRIPTS.  The bill in newly
 13 11 designated Code section 232.147(3B) provides that if the court
 13 12 has excluded the public from a hearing pursuant to Code section
 13 13 232.39 or 232.92, the transcript of the proceedings shall not
 13 14 be deemed a public record and inspection and disclosure of
 13 15 the contents of the transcript shall not be permitted except
 13 16 pursuant to a court order or unless otherwise provided in Code
 13 17 chapter 232.
 13 18    USE OF ADJUDICATION OF DELINQUENCY FOR PENALTY ENHANCEMENTS
 13 19 OR EVIDENCE.  The bill in newly designated Code section
 13 20 232.147(13) provides that the confidentiality of a final
 13 21 adjudication of delinquency under Code section 232.147 or
 13 22 pursuant to Code section 232.149A shall not prohibit the state
 13 23 from pleading or proving the adjudication at a subsequent
 13 24 criminal or delinquency proceeding for the purpose of penalty
 13 25 enhancement when a provision of the Code specifically deems the
 13 26 delinquency adjudication to constitute a final conviction.
 13 27    The bill in newly designated Code section 232.147(14)
 13 28 provides that the provisions of the bill shall not be construed
 13 29 to limit or restrict the production, use, or introduction
 13 30 of official juvenile court records in any juvenile or adult
 13 31 criminal proceeding, where such records are relevant and deemed
 13 32 admissible under any other provision of the law.
 13 33    CONFIDENTIALITY OF RECORDS AND FILES OF CRIMINAL OR
 13 34 JUVENILE JUSTICE AGENCIES.  Under current law, records and
 13 35 files of a criminal or juvenile justice agency concerning
 14  1 a child involved in a delinquent act are public records,
 14  2 subject to certain exceptions. The bill in Code section
 14  3 232.149 provides that the records and files of a criminal or
 14  4 juvenile justice agency, an intake officer, or a juvenile court
 14  5 officer concerning a child involved in a delinquent act are
 14  6 confidential. The bill further provides that the records of an
 14  7 intake officer or juvenile court officer containing a dismissal
 14  8 of a complaint or an informal adjustment of a complaint when
 14  9 no petition is filed relating to the complaint, shall not be
 14 10 available to the public, but may be disclosed to the judge and
 14 11 professional court staff, including juvenile court officers;
 14 12 the child's counsel or guardian ad litem; the county attorney
 14 13 and county attorney's assistants;  the superintendent or the
 14 14 superintendent's designee of the school district for the
 14 15 school attended by the child or the authorities in charge of
 14 16 an accredited nonpublic school attended by the child; a member
 14 17 of the armed forces of the United States who is conducting a
 14 18 background investigation of an individual pursuant to federal
 14 19 law; the statistical analysis center for the purposes stated
 14 20 in Code section 216A.136; the state public defender;  the
 14 21 department of human services; and the alleged victim of the
 14 22 delinquent act.
 14 23    PUBLIC RECORDS HEARINGS.  The bill enacts new Code section
 14 24 232.149B, which provides that a person may apply for a court
 14 25 order to make confidential juvenile court records public.
 14 26 The bill provides that a rebuttable presumption exists that
 14 27 official juvenile court records shall remain confidential. The
 14 28 bill provides that the court shall order the official juvenile
 14 29 court records in such a delinquency proceeding to be public
 14 30 records if either the public's interest in making the records
 14 31 public outweighs the juvenile's interest in maintaining the
 14 32 confidentiality of the records or the juvenile has been placed
 14 33 on youthful offender status pursuant to Code section 232.45(7)
 14 34 and Code section 907.3A(1), and will be transferred back to
 14 35 the district court for sentencing prior to the child's 18th
 15  1 birthday. The court may order the official juvenile court
 15  2 records in such a delinquency proceeding to be public records
 15  3 if the juvenile has been subsequently adjudicated delinquent
 15  4 for a public offense that would be a serious misdemeanor,
 15  5 aggravated misdemeanor, or felony offense if committed by an
 15  6 adult, or another delinquency proceeding is pending seeking
 15  7 such an adjudication. The bill provides that records subject
 15  8 to a public records order may be sealed at a later date
 15  9 pursuant to Code section 232.150.
 15 10    RIGHT TO REVIEW AND RELEASE A CONFIDENTIAL COMPLAINT.  The
 15 11 bill provides that delinquency complaints shall be released
 15 12 in accordance with Code section 915.25. Under current Code
 15 13 section 915.25, a complaint which alleges that a child who is
 15 14 at least 10 years of age committed a delinquent act, which if
 15 15 committed by an adult would be a public offense, is a public
 15 16 record. Current Code section 915.25 authorizes the court,
 15 17 its designee, or law enforcement officials to release such
 15 18 a complaint, including the identity of the child. The bill
 15 19 amends Code section 915.25 to provide that such a complaint
 15 20 is confidential unless the complaint alleges that the child
 15 21 committed a delinquent act that if committed by an adult would
 15 22 be a forcible felony. However, the bill authorizes state and
 15 23 local enforcement officials to release a confidential complaint
 15 24 against a child if the child is at large and doing so is deemed
 15 25 necessary for the protection of the public or the safety of
 15 26 the child. If the complaint is not confidential because the
 15 27 alleged delinquent act is an act that would be a forcible
 15 28 felony if committed by an adult, the court, its designee,
 15 29 or law enforcement officials may release such a complaint,
 15 30 including the identity of the child.
 15 31    The bill provides that an intake or juvenile court officer
 15 32 shall disclose to the alleged victim of a delinquent act, upon
 15 33 request, the complaint, the name and address of the child who
 15 34 allegedly committed the delinquent act, and the disposition
 15 35 of the complaint. If the alleged delinquent act would be
 16  1 a forcible felony if committed by an adult, the intake or
 16  2 juvenile court officer shall provide notification to the victim
 16  3 as required by Code section 915.24.
 16  4    SEALING OF JUVENILE COURT RECORDS UNAVAILABLE FOR
 16  5 OPERATING=WHILE=INTOXICATED VIOLATIONS.  Under current Code
 16  6 section 232.150, a court shall order juvenile court records
 16  7 to be sealed if the person who is the subject of the juvenile
 16  8 court records is 18 years of age or older and 2 years have
 16  9 elapsed since the last official action in the person's case,
 16 10 the person has not been subsequently convicted of a felony
 16 11 or an aggravated or serious misdemeanor or adjudicated a
 16 12 delinquent child for an act which if committed by an adult
 16 13 would be a felony, an aggravated misdemeanor, or a serious
 16 14 misdemeanor and no proceeding is pending seeking such
 16 15 conviction or adjudication, and the person was not placed on
 16 16 youthful offender status, transferred back to district court
 16 17 after the youthful offender's 18th birthday, and sentenced for
 16 18 the offense which precipitated the youthful offender placement.
 16 19 The bill in newly designated Code section 232.150(4) provides
 16 20 that the court shall not seal a person's juvenile court records
 16 21 if the person was adjudicated delinquent for violating Code
 16 22 section 321J.2, which prohibits the operation of a motor
 16 23 vehicle while under the influence of alcohol or a drug.
 16 24    RELEASE OF CONFIDENTIAL RECORDS.  The bill provides that a
 16 25 public record which is confidential under the provisions of
 16 26 Code chapter 232 shall only be subject to release upon order of
 16 27 a court in a proceeding under Code chapter 232.
 16 28    EXISTING CONFIDENTIALITY EXEMPTIONS.  The bill retains
 16 29 certain existing exemptions to confidentiality of juvenile
 16 30 court records. Pursuant to Code section 692A.121(8), records
 16 31 concerning sex offense convictions which are committed by
 16 32 minors may be released in the same manner as records of
 16 33 convictions of adults. Pursuant to Code section 915.10A,
 16 34 information concerning a juvenile charged with a felony offense
 16 35 may be released pursuant to an automated victim notification
 17  1 system. Under the bill, these exemptions to confidentiality
 17  2 are not amended and therefore still apply to juvenile court
 17  3 records.
 17  4    RIGHT TO COUNSEL.  The bill in Code section 232.11 provides
 17  5 that a child has the right to be represented by counsel at a
 17  6 hearing on a confidentiality order under Code section 232.149A
 17  7 or a public records order under Code section 232.149B.
 17  8    APPLICABILITY.  The bill applies to juvenile delinquency
 17  9 proceedings which are pending or arise on or after July 1,
 17 10 2016.

 10 32    This bill relates to the confidentiality of juvenile court
 10 33 records.
 10 34    CONFIDENTIALITY OF JUVENILE RECORDS.  Under current law,
 10 35 juvenile court records in cases alleging delinquency are public
 11  1 records unless a judge either grants a request to make the
 11  2 records confidential or seals the records. The bill in Code
 11  3 section 232.147(3) provides that juvenile court records are
 11  4 confidential and therefore are not public records except in
 11  5 cases alleging the commission of a delinquent act that would be
 11  6 a forcible felony if committed by an adult. Under Code section
 11  7 702.11, a forcible felony is any felonious child endangerment,
 11  8 assault, murder, sexual abuse, kidnapping, robbery, human
 11  9 trafficking, arson in the first degree, or burglary in the
 11 10 first degree. If juvenile records are not confidential, the
 11 11 bill provides that a juvenile court officer may release such
 11 12 records.
 11 13    CONFIDENTIALITY ORDERS.  The bill in Code section 232.149A
 11 14 provides that a court shall order juvenile court records
 11 15 alleging the commission of a delinquent act that would be a
 11 16 forcible felony if committed by an adult to be confidential
 11 17 if the court finds that the case has been dismissed and the
 11 18 person is no longer subject to the jurisdiction of the juvenile
 11 19 court and that the child's interest in making the records
 11 20 confidential outweighs the public's interest in the records
 11 21 remaining public records.
 11 22    ACCESS TO CONFIDENTIAL JUVENILE RECORDS.  The bill and
 11 23 Code section 232.147(3) provide that unless an order sealing
 11 24 confidential juvenile records has been entered, confidential
 11 25 juvenile records may still be inspected, without a court
 11 26 order, by the judge and professional court staff, including
 11 27 juvenile court officers; the child and the child's counsel;
 11 28 the child's parent, guardian or custodian, court appointed
 11 29 special advocate, and guardian ad litem, and the members of
 11 30 the child advocacy board created in Code section 237.16 or a
 11 31 local citizen foster care review board created in accordance
 11 32 with Code section 237.19 who are assigning or reviewing the
 11 33 child's case; the county attorney and the county attorney's
 11 34 assistants; an agency, association, facility, or institution
 11 35 which has custody of the child, or is legally responsible for
 12  1 the care, treatment, or supervision of the child, including
 12  2 the department of human services; a court, court professional
 12  3 staff, and adult probation officers in connection with the
 12  4 preparation of a presentence report concerning a person
 12  5 who prior thereto had been the subject of a juvenile court
 12  6 delinquency proceeding; the child's foster parent or an
 12  7 individual providing preadoptive care to the child; the state
 12  8 public defender; the department of corrections; a judicial
 12  9 district department of correctional services; the board of
 12 10 parole; the superintendent or the superintendent's designee of
 12 11 the school district for the school attended by the child or
 12 12 the authorities in charge of an accredited nonpublic school
 12 13 attended by the child; a member of the armed forces of the
 12 14 United States who is conducting a background investigation of
 12 15 an individual pursuant to federal law; the statistical analysis
 12 16 center for the purposes stated in Code section 216A.136; a
 12 17 state or local law enforcement agency; and the alleged victim
 12 18 of any delinquent act in the proceeding.
 12 19    The bill in newly designated Code section 232.147(3A)
 12 20 provides that juvenile court records containing a petition or
 12 21 complaint alleging the commission of a delinquent act that
 12 22 would be a forcible felony if committed by an adult shall be
 12 23 public records unless subject to a confidentiality order under
 12 24 Code section 232.149A or a sealing order under Code section
 12 25 232.150.  However, the bill provides that such official records
 12 26 shall not be available to the public or any governmental
 12 27 agency through the internet or in an electronic customized
 12 28 data report unless the child has been adjudicated delinquent
 12 29 in the matter.  Nevertheless, the bill provides that official
 12 30 juvenile court records may be disclosed without a court order
 12 31 through the internet or in an electronic customized data
 12 32 report prior to the child being adjudicated delinquent to the
 12 33 judge and professional court staff, including juvenile court
 12 34 officers; the child's counsel or guardian ad litem; the county
 12 35 attorney and the county attorney's assistants; a court, court
 13  1 professional staff, and adult probation officers in connection
 13  2 with the preparation of a presentence report concerning a
 13  3 person who prior thereto had been the subject of a juvenile
 13  4 court proceeding; a state or local law enforcement agency; the

 13  6 the purposes stated in Code section 216A.136; the department
 13  7 of human services; the department of corrections; a judicial
 13  8 district department of correctional services; and the board of
 13  9 parole.
 13 10    CONFIDENTIALITY OF TRANSCRIPTS.  The bill in newly
 13 11 designated Code section 232.147(3B) provides that if the court
 13 12 has excluded the public from a hearing pursuant to Code section
 13 13 232.39 or 232.92, the transcript of the proceedings shall not
 13 14 be deemed a public record and inspection and disclosure of
 13 15 the contents of the transcript shall not be permitted except
 13 16 pursuant to a court order or unless otherwise provided in Code
 13 17 chapter 232.
 13 18    USE OF ADJUDICATION OF DELINQUENCY FOR PENALTY ENHANCEMENTS
 13 19 OR EVIDENCE.  The bill in newly designated Code section
 13 20 232.147(13) provides that the confidentiality of a final
 13 21 adjudication of delinquency under Code section 232.147 or
 13 22 pursuant to Code section 232.149A shall not prohibit the state
 13 23 from pleading or proving the adjudication at a subsequent
 13 24 criminal or delinquency proceeding for the purpose of penalty
 13 25 enhancement when a provision of the Code specifically deems the
 13 26 delinquency adjudication to constitute a final conviction.
 13 27    The bill in newly designated Code section 232.147(14)
 13 28 provides that the provisions of the bill shall not be construed
 13 29 to limit or restrict the production, use, or introduction
 13 30 of official juvenile court records in any juvenile or adult
 13 31 criminal proceeding, where such records are relevant and deemed
 13 32 admissible under any other provision of the law.
 13 33    CONFIDENTIALITY OF RECORDS AND FILES OF CRIMINAL OR
 13 34 JUVENILE JUSTICE AGENCIES.  Under current law, records and
 13 35 files of a criminal or juvenile justice agency concerning
 14  1 a child involved in a delinquent act are public records,
 14  2 subject to certain exceptions. The bill in Code section
 14  3 232.149 provides that the records and files of a criminal or
 14  4 juvenile justice agency, an intake officer, or a juvenile court
 14  5 officer concerning a child involved in a delinquent act are
 14  6 confidential. The bill further provides that the records of an
 14  7 intake officer or juvenile court officer containing a dismissal
 14  8 of a complaint or an informal adjustment of a complaint when
 14  9 no petition is filed relating to the complaint, shall not be
 14 10 available to the public, but may be disclosed to the judge and
 14 11 professional court staff, including juvenile court officers;
 14 12 the child's counsel or guardian ad litem; the county attorney
 14 13 and county attorney's assistants;  the superintendent or the

 14 20 in Code section 216A.136; the state public defender;  the
 14 21 department of human services; and the alleged victim of the
 14 22 delinquent act.
 14 23    PUBLIC RECORDS HEARINGS.  The bill enacts new Code section
 14 24 232.149B, which provides that a person may apply for a court
 14 25 order to make confidential juvenile court records public.
 14 26 The bill provides that a rebuttable presumption exists that
 14 27 official juvenile court records shall remain confidential. The
 14 28 bill provides that the court shall order the official juvenile
 14 29 court records in such a delinquency proceeding to be public
 14 30 records if either the public's interest in making the records
 14 31 public outweighs the juvenile's interest in maintaining the
 14 32 confidentiality of the records or the juvenile has been placed
 14 33 on youthful offender status pursuant to Code section 232.45(7)
 14 34 and Code section 907.3A(1), and will be transferred back to
 14 35 the district court for sentencing prior to the child's 18th
 15  1 birthday. The court may order the official juvenile court
 15  2 records in such a delinquency proceeding to be public records
 15  3 if the juvenile has been subsequently adjudicated delinquent
 15  4 for a public offense that would be a serious misdemeanor,
 15  5 aggravated misdemeanor, or felony offense if committed by an
 15  6 adult, or another delinquency proceeding is pending seeking
 15  7 such an adjudication. The bill provides that records subject
 15  8 to a public records order may be sealed at a later date
 15  9 pursuant to Code section 232.150.
 15 10    RIGHT TO REVIEW AND RELEASE A CONFIDENTIAL COMPLAINT.  The
 15 11 bill provides that delinquency complaints shall be released
 15 12 in accordance with Code section 915.25. Under current Code
 15 13 section 915.25, a complaint which alleges that a child who is
 15 14 at least 10 years of age committed a delinquent act, which if
 15 15 committed by an adult would be a public offense, is a public
 15 16 record. Current Code section 915.25 authorizes the court,
 15 17 its designee, or law enforcement officials to release such
 15 18 a complaint, including the identity of the child. The bill
 15 19 amends Code section 915.25 to provide that such a complaint
 15 20 is confidential unless the complaint alleges that the child
 15 21 committed a delinquent act that if committed by an adult would
 15 22 be a forcible felony. However, the bill authorizes state and
 15 23 local enforcement officials to release a confidential complaint
 15 24 against a child if the child is at large and doing so is deemed
 15 25 necessary for the protection of the public or the safety of
 15 26 the child. If the complaint is not confidential because the
 15 27 alleged delinquent act is an act that would be a forcible
 15 28 felony if committed by an adult, the court, its designee,
 15 29 or law enforcement officials may release such a complaint,
 15 30 including the identity of the child.
 15 31    The bill provides that an intake or juvenile court officer
 15 32 shall disclose to the alleged victim of a delinquent act, upon
 15 33 request, the complaint, the name and address of the child who
 15 34 allegedly committed the delinquent act, and the disposition
 15 35 of the complaint. If the alleged delinquent act would be
 16  1 a forcible felony if committed by an adult, the intake or
 16  2 juvenile court officer shall provide notification to the victim
 16  3 as required by Code section 915.24.
 16  4    SEALING OF JUVENILE COURT RECORDS UNAVAILABLE FOR
 16  5 OPERATING=WHILE=INTOXICATED VIOLATIONS.  Under current Code
 16  6 section 232.150, a court shall order juvenile court records
 16  7 to be sealed if the person who is the subject of the juvenile
 16  8 court records is 18 years of age or older and 2 years have
 16  9 elapsed since the last official action in the person's case,
 16 10 the person has not been subsequently convicted of a felony
 16 11 or an aggravated or serious misdemeanor or adjudicated a
 16 12 delinquent child for an act which if committed by an adult
 16 13 would be a felony, an aggravated misdemeanor, or a serious
 16 14 misdemeanor and no proceeding is pending seeking such
 16 15 conviction or adjudication, and the person was not placed on
 16 16 youthful offender status, transferred back to district court
 16 17 after the youthful offender's 18th birthday, and sentenced for
 16 18 the offense which precipitated the youthful offender placement.
 16 19 The bill in newly designated Code section 232.150(4) provides
 16 20 that the court shall not seal a person's juvenile court records
 16 21 if the person was adjudicated delinquent for violating Code
 16 22 section 321J.2, which prohibits the operation of a motor
 16 23 vehicle while under the influence of alcohol or a drug.
 16 24    RELEASE OF CONFIDENTIAL RECORDS.  The bill provides that a
 16 25 public record which is confidential under the provisions of
 16 26 Code chapter 232 shall only be subject to release upon order of
 16 27 a court in a proceeding under Code chapter 232.
 16 28    EXISTING CONFIDENTIALITY EXEMPTIONS.  The bill retains
 16 29 certain existing exemptions to confidentiality of juvenile
 16 30 court records. Pursuant to Code section 692A.121(8), records
 16 31 concerning sex offense convictions which are committed by
 16 32 minors may be released in the same manner as records of
 16 33 convictions of adults. Pursuant to Code section 915.10A,
 16 34 information concerning a juvenile charged with a felony offense
 16 35 may be released pursuant to an automated victim notification
 17  1 system. Under the bill, these exemptions to confidentiality
 17  2 are not amended and therefore still apply to juvenile court
 17  3 records.
 17  4    RIGHT TO COUNSEL.  The bill in Code section 232.11 provides
 17  5 that a child has the right to be represented by counsel at a
 17  6 hearing on a confidentiality order under Code section 232.149A
 17  7 or a public records order under Code section 232.149B.
 17  8    APPLICABILITY.  The bill applies to juvenile delinquency
 17  9 proceedings which are pending or arise on or after July 1,
 17 10 2016.

 10 33 records.
 10 34    CONFIDENTIALITY OF JUVENILE RECORDS.  Under current law,
 10 35 juvenile court records in cases alleging delinquency are public
 11  1 records unless a judge either grants a request to make the
 11  2 records confidential or seals the records. The bill in Code
 11  3 section 232.147(3) provides that juvenile court records are
 11  4 confidential and therefore are not public records except in
 11  5 cases alleging the commission of a delinquent act that would be
 11  6 a forcible felony if committed by an adult. Under Code section
 11  7 702.11, a forcible felony is any felonious child endangerment,
 11  8 assault, murder, sexual abuse, kidnapping, robbery, human
 11  9 trafficking, arson in the first degree, or burglary in the
 11 10 first degree. If juvenile records are not confidential, the
 11 11 bill provides that a juvenile court officer may release such
 11 12 records.
 11 13    CONFIDENTIALITY ORDERS.  The bill in Code section 232.149A
 11 14 provides that a court shall order juvenile court records
 11 15 alleging the commission of a delinquent act that would be a
 11 16 forcible felony if committed by an adult to be confidential
 11 17 if the court finds that the case has been dismissed and the
 11 18 person is no longer subject to the jurisdiction of the juvenile
 11 19 court and that the child's interest in making the records
 11 20 confidential outweighs the public's interest in the records
 11 21 remaining public records.
 11 22    ACCESS TO CONFIDENTIAL JUVENILE RECORDS.  The bill and
 11 23 Code section 232.147(3) provide that unless an order sealing
 11 24 confidential juvenile records has been entered, confidential
 11 25 juvenile records may still be inspected, without a court
 11 26 order, by the judge and professional court staff, including
 11 27 juvenile court officers; the child and the child's counsel;
 11 28 the child's parent, guardian or custodian, court appointed
 11 29 special advocate, and guardian ad litem, and the members of
 11 30 the child advocacy board created in Code section 237.16 or a
 11 31 local citizen foster care review board created in accordance
 11 32 with Code section 237.19 who are assigning or reviewing the
 11 33 child's case; the county attorney and the county attorney's
 11 34 assistants; an agency, association, facility, or institution
 11 35 which has custody of the child, or is legally responsible for
 12  1 the care, treatment, or supervision of the child, including
 12  2 the department of human services; a court, court professional
 12  3 staff, and adult probation officers in connection with the
 12  4 preparation of a presentence report concerning a person
 12  5 who prior thereto had been the subject of a juvenile court
 12  6 delinquency proceeding; the child's foster parent or an
 12  7 individual providing preadoptive care to the child; the state
 12  8 public defender; the department of corrections; a judicial
 12  9 district department of correctional services; the board of
 12 10 parole; the superintendent or the superintendent's designee of
 12 11 the school district for the school attended by the child or
 12 12 the authorities in charge of an accredited nonpublic school
 12 13 attended by the child; a member of the armed forces of the
 12 14 United States who is conducting a background investigation of
 12 15 an individual pursuant to federal law; the statistical analysis
 12 16 center for the purposes stated in Code section 216A.136; a
 12 17 state or local law enforcement agency; and the alleged victim
 12 18 of any delinquent act in the proceeding.
 12 19    The bill in newly designated Code section 232.147(3A)
 12 20 provides that juvenile court records containing a petition or
 12 21 complaint alleging the commission of a delinquent act that
 12 22 would be a forcible felony if committed by an adult shall be
 12 23 public records unless subject to a confidentiality order under
 12 24 Code section 232.149A or a sealing order under Code section
 12 25 232.150.  However, the bill provides that such official records
 12 26 shall not be available to the public or any governmental
 12 27 agency through the internet or in an electronic customized
 12 28 data report unless the child has been adjudicated delinquent
 12 29 in the matter.  Nevertheless, the bill provides that official
 12 30 juvenile court records may be disclosed without a court order
 12 31 through the internet or in an electronic customized data
 12 32 report prior to the child being adjudicated delinquent to the
 12 33 judge and professional court staff, including juvenile court
 12 34 officers; the child's counsel or guardian ad litem; the county
 12 35 attorney and the county attorney's assistants; a court, court
 13  1 professional staff, and adult probation officers in connection
 13  2 with the preparation of a presentence report concerning a
 13  3 person who prior thereto had been the subject of a juvenile
 13  4 court proceeding; a state or local law enforcement agency; the
 13  5 state public defender; the statistical analysis center for
 13  6 the purposes stated in Code section 216A.136; the department
 13  7 of human services; the department of corrections; a judicial
 13  8 district department of correctional services; and the board of
 13  9 parole.
 13 10    CONFIDENTIALITY OF TRANSCRIPTS.  The bill in newly
 13 11 designated Code section 232.147(3B) provides that if the court
 13 12 has excluded the public from a hearing pursuant to Code section
 13 13 232.39 or 232.92, the transcript of the proceedings shall not
 13 14 be deemed a public record and inspection and disclosure of
 13 15 the contents of the transcript shall not be permitted except
 13 16 pursuant to a court order or unless otherwise provided in Code
 13 17 chapter 232.
 13 18    USE OF ADJUDICATION OF DELINQUENCY FOR PENALTY ENHANCEMENTS
 13 19 OR EVIDENCE.  The bill in newly designated Code section
 13 20 232.147(13) provides that the confidentiality of a final
 13 21 adjudication of delinquency under Code section 232.147 or
 13 22 pursuant to Code section 232.149A shall not prohibit the state
 13 23 from pleading or proving the adjudication at a subsequent
 13 24 criminal or delinquency proceeding for the purpose of penalty
 13 25 enhancement when a provision of the Code specifically deems the
 13 26 delinquency adjudication to constitute a final conviction.
 13 27    The bill in newly designated Code section 232.147(14)
 13 28 provides that the provisions of the bill shall not be construed
 13 29 to limit or restrict the production, use, or introduction
 13 30 of official juvenile court records in any juvenile or adult
 13 31 criminal proceeding, where such records are relevant and deemed
 13 32 admissible under any other provision of the law.
 13 33    CONFIDENTIALITY OF RECORDS AND FILES OF CRIMINAL OR
 13 34 JUVENILE JUSTICE AGENCIES.  Under current law, records and
 13 35 files of a criminal or juvenile justice agency concerning
 14  1 a child involved in a delinquent act are public records,
 14  2 subject to certain exceptions. The bill in Code section
 14  3 232.149 provides that the records and files of a criminal or
 14  4 juvenile justice agency, an intake officer, or a juvenile court
 14  5 officer concerning a child involved in a delinquent act are
 14  6 confidential. The bill further provides that the records of an
 14  7 intake officer or juvenile court officer containing a dismissal
 14  8 of a complaint or an informal adjustment of a complaint when
 14  9 no petition is filed relating to the complaint, shall not be
 14 10 available to the public, but may be disclosed to the judge and
 14 11 professional court staff, including juvenile court officers;
 14 12 the child's counsel or guardian ad litem; the county attorney
 14 13 and county attorney's assistants;  the superintendent or the
 14 14 superintendent's designee of the school district for the
 14 15 school attended by the child or the authorities in charge of
 14 16 an accredited nonpublic school attended by the child; a member
 14 17 of the armed forces of the United States who is conducting a
 14 18 background investigation of an individual pursuant to federal
 14 19 law; the statistical analysis center for the purposes stated
 14 20 in Code section 216A.136; the state public defender;  the
 14 21 department of human services; and the alleged victim of the
 14 22 delinquent act.
 14 23    PUBLIC RECORDS HEARINGS.  The bill enacts new Code section
 14 24 232.149B, which provides that a person may apply for a court
 14 25 order to make confidential juvenile court records public.
 14 26 The bill provides that a rebuttable presumption exists that
 14 27 official juvenile court records shall remain confidential. The
 14 28 bill provides that the court shall order the official juvenile
 14 29 court records in such a delinquency proceeding to be public
 14 30 records if either the public's interest in making the records
 14 31 public outweighs the juvenile's interest in maintaining the
 14 32 confidentiality of the records or the juvenile has been placed
 14 33 on youthful offender status pursuant to Code section 232.45(7)
 14 34 and Code section 907.3A(1), and will be transferred back to
 14 35 the district court for sentencing prior to the child's 18th
 15  1 birthday. The court may order the official juvenile court
 15  2 records in such a delinquency proceeding to be public records
 15  3 if the juvenile has been subsequently adjudicated delinquent
 15  4 for a public offense that would be a serious misdemeanor,
 15  5 aggravated misdemeanor, or felony offense if committed by an
 15  6 adult, or another delinquency proceeding is pending seeking
 15  7 such an adjudication. The bill provides that records subject
 15  8 to a public records order may be sealed at a later date
 15  9 pursuant to Code section 232.150.
 15 10    RIGHT TO REVIEW AND RELEASE A CONFIDENTIAL COMPLAINT.  The
 15 11 bill provides that delinquency complaints shall be released
 15 12 in accordance with Code section 915.25. Under current Code
 15 13 section 915.25, a complaint which alleges that a child who is
 15 14 at least 10 years of age committed a delinquent act, which if
 15 15 committed by an adult would be a public offense, is a public
 15 16 record. Current Code section 915.25 authorizes the court,
 15 17 its designee, or law enforcement officials to release such
 15 18 a complaint, including the identity of the child. The bill
 15 19 amends Code section 915.25 to provide that such a complaint
 15 20 is confidential unless the complaint alleges that the child
 15 21 committed a delinquent act that if committed by an adult would
 15 22 be a forcible felony. However, the bill authorizes state and
 15 23 local enforcement officials to release a confidential complaint
 15 24 against a child if the child is at large and doing so is deemed
 15 25 necessary for the protection of the public or the safety of
 15 26 the child. If the complaint is not confidential because the
 15 27 alleged delinquent act is an act that would be a forcible
 15 28 felony if committed by an adult, the court, its designee,
 15 29 or law enforcement officials may release such a complaint,
 15 30 including the identity of the child.
 15 31    The bill provides that an intake or juvenile court officer
 15 32 shall disclose to the alleged victim of a delinquent act, upon
 15 33 request, the complaint, the name and address of the child who
 15 34 allegedly committed the delinquent act, and the disposition
 15 35 of the complaint. If the alleged delinquent act would be
 16  1 a forcible felony if committed by an adult, the intake or
 16  2 juvenile court officer shall provide notification to the victim
 16  3 as required by Code section 915.24.
 16  4    SEALING OF JUVENILE COURT RECORDS UNAVAILABLE FOR
 16  5 OPERATING=WHILE=INTOXICATED VIOLATIONS.  Under current Code
 16  6 section 232.150, a court shall order juvenile court records
 16  7 to be sealed if the person who is the subject of the juvenile
 16  8 court records is 18 years of age or older and 2 years have
 16  9 elapsed since the last official action in the person's case,
 16 10 the person has not been subsequently convicted of a felony
 16 11 or an aggravated or serious misdemeanor or adjudicated a
 16 12 delinquent child for an act which if committed by an adult
 16 13 would be a felony, an aggravated misdemeanor, or a serious
 16 14 misdemeanor and no proceeding is pending seeking such
 16 15 conviction or adjudication, and the person was not placed on
 16 16 youthful offender status, transferred back to district court
 16 17 after the youthful offender's 18th birthday, and sentenced for
 16 18 the offense which precipitated the youthful offender placement.
 16 19 The bill in newly designated Code section 232.150(4) provides
 16 20 that the court shall not seal a person's juvenile court records
 16 21 if the person was adjudicated delinquent for violating Code
 16 22 section 321J.2, which prohibits the operation of a motor
 16 23 vehicle while under the influence of alcohol or a drug.
 16 24    RELEASE OF CONFIDENTIAL RECORDS.  The bill provides that a
 16 25 public record which is confidential under the provisions of
 16 26 Code chapter 232 shall only be subject to release upon order of
 16 27 a court in a proceeding under Code chapter 232.
 16 28    EXISTING CONFIDENTIALITY EXEMPTIONS.  The bill retains
 16 29 certain existing exemptions to confidentiality of juvenile
 16 30 court records. Pursuant to Code section 692A.121(8), records
 16 31 concerning sex offense convictions which are committed by
 16 32 minors may be released in the same manner as records of
 16 33 convictions of adults. Pursuant to Code section 915.10A,
 16 34 information concerning a juvenile charged with a felony offense
 16 35 may be released pursuant to an automated victim notification
 17  1 system. Under the bill, these exemptions to confidentiality
 17  2 are not amended and therefore still apply to juvenile court
 17  3 records.
 17  4    RIGHT TO COUNSEL.  The bill in Code section 232.11 provides
 17  5 that a child has the right to be represented by counsel at a
 17  6 hearing on a confidentiality order under Code section 232.149A
 17  7 or a public records order under Code section 232.149B.

 10 34    CONFIDENTIALITY OF JUVENILE RECORDS.  Under current law,
 10 35 juvenile court records in cases alleging delinquency are public
 11  1 records unless a judge either grants a request to make the
 11  2 records confidential or seals the records. The bill in Code
 11  3 section 232.147(3) provides that juvenile court records are
 11  4 confidential and therefore are not public records except in
 11  5 cases alleging the commission of a delinquent act that would be
 11  6 a forcible felony if committed by an adult. Under Code section
 11  7 702.11, a forcible felony is any felonious child endangerment,
 11  8 assault, murder, sexual abuse, kidnapping, robbery, human
 11  9 trafficking, arson in the first degree, or burglary in the
 11 10 first degree. If juvenile records are not confidential, the
 11 11 bill provides that a juvenile court officer may release such
 11 12 records.
 11 13    CONFIDENTIALITY ORDERS.  The bill in Code section 232.149A
 11 14 provides that a court shall order juvenile court records
 11 15 alleging the commission of a delinquent act that would be a
 11 16 forcible felony if committed by an adult to be confidential
 11 17 if the court finds that the case has been dismissed and the
 11 18 person is no longer subject to the jurisdiction of the juvenile
 11 19 court and that the child's interest in making the records
 11 20 confidential outweighs the public's interest in the records
 11 21 remaining public records.
 11 22    ACCESS TO CONFIDENTIAL JUVENILE RECORDS.  The bill and
 11 23 Code section 232.147(3) provide that unless an order sealing
 11 24 confidential juvenile records has been entered, confidential
 11 25 juvenile records may still be inspected, without a court
 11 26 order, by the judge and professional court staff, including
 11 27 juvenile court officers; the child and the child's counsel;
 11 28 the child's parent, guardian or custodian, court appointed
 11 29 special advocate, and guardian ad litem, and the members of
 11 30 the child advocacy board created in Code section 237.16 or a
 11 31 local citizen foster care review board created in accordance
 11 32 with Code section 237.19 who are assigning or reviewing the
 11 33 child's case; the county attorney and the county attorney's
 11 34 assistants; an agency, association, facility, or institution
 11 35 which has custody of the child, or is legally responsible for
 12  1 the care, treatment, or supervision of the child, including
 12  2 the department of human services; a court, court professional

 12  6 delinquency proceeding; the child's foster parent or an
 12  7 individual providing preadoptive care to the child; the state
 12  8 public defender; the department of corrections; a judicial

 12 13 attended by the child; a member of the armed forces of the
 12 14 United States who is conducting a background investigation of
 12 15 an individual pursuant to federal law; the statistical analysis
 12 16 center for the purposes stated in Code section 216A.136; a
 12 17 state or local law enforcement agency; and the alleged victim
 12 18 of any delinquent act in the proceeding.
 12 19    The bill in newly designated Code section 232.147(3A)
 12 20 provides that juvenile court records containing a petition or
 12 21 complaint alleging the commission of a delinquent act that
 12 22 would be a forcible felony if committed by an adult shall be
 12 23 public records unless subject to a confidentiality order under
 12 24 Code section 232.149A or a sealing order under Code section
 12 25 232.150.  However, the bill provides that such official records
 12 26 shall not be available to the public or any governmental
 12 27 agency through the internet or in an electronic customized
 12 28 data report unless the child has been adjudicated delinquent
 12 29 in the matter.  Nevertheless, the bill provides that official
 12 30 juvenile court records may be disclosed without a court order
 12 31 through the internet or in an electronic customized data
 12 32 report prior to the child being adjudicated delinquent to the
 12 33 judge and professional court staff, including juvenile court
 12 34 officers; the child's counsel or guardian ad litem; the county
 12 35 attorney and the county attorney's assistants; a court, court
 13  1 professional staff, and adult probation officers in connection

 13  7 of human services; the department of corrections; a judicial
 13  8 district department of correctional services; and the board of
 13  9 parole.
 13 10    CONFIDENTIALITY OF TRANSCRIPTS.  The bill in newly
 13 11 designated Code section 232.147(3B) provides that if the court
 13 12 has excluded the public from a hearing pursuant to Code section
 13 13 232.39 or 232.92, the transcript of the proceedings shall not
 13 14 be deemed a public record and inspection and disclosure of
 13 15 the contents of the transcript shall not be permitted except
 13 16 pursuant to a court order or unless otherwise provided in Code
 13 17 chapter 232.
 13 18    USE OF ADJUDICATION OF DELINQUENCY FOR PENALTY ENHANCEMENTS
 13 19 OR EVIDENCE.  The bill in newly designated Code section
 13 20 232.147(13) provides that the confidentiality of a final
 13 21 adjudication of delinquency under Code section 232.147 or
 13 22 pursuant to Code section 232.149A shall not prohibit the state
 13 23 from pleading or proving the adjudication at a subsequent
 13 24 criminal or delinquency proceeding for the purpose of penalty
 13 25 enhancement when a provision of the Code specifically deems the
 13 26 delinquency adjudication to constitute a final conviction.
 13 27    The bill in newly designated Code section 232.147(14)
 13 28 provides that the provisions of the bill shall not be construed
 13 29 to limit or restrict the production, use, or introduction
 13 30 of official juvenile court records in any juvenile or adult
 13 31 criminal proceeding, where such records are relevant and deemed
 13 32 admissible under any other provision of the law.
 13 33    CONFIDENTIALITY OF RECORDS AND FILES OF CRIMINAL OR
 13 34 JUVENILE JUSTICE AGENCIES.  Under current law, records and
 13 35 files of a criminal or juvenile justice agency concerning
 14  1 a child involved in a delinquent act are public records,
 14  2 subject to certain exceptions. The bill in Code section
 14  3 232.149 provides that the records and files of a criminal or
 14  4 juvenile justice agency, an intake officer, or a juvenile court
 14  5 officer concerning a child involved in a delinquent act are
 14  6 confidential. The bill further provides that the records of an
 14  7 intake officer or juvenile court officer containing a dismissal
 14  8 of a complaint or an informal adjustment of a complaint when
 14  9 no petition is filed relating to the complaint, shall not be
 14 10 available to the public, but may be disclosed to the judge and
 14 11 professional court staff, including juvenile court officers;
 14 12 the child's counsel or guardian ad litem; the county attorney
 14 13 and county attorney's assistants;  the superintendent or the
 14 14 superintendent's designee of the school district for the
 14 15 school attended by the child or the authorities in charge of
 14 16 an accredited nonpublic school attended by the child; a member
 14 17 of the armed forces of the United States who is conducting a
 14 18 background investigation of an individual pursuant to federal
 14 19 law; the statistical analysis center for the purposes stated
 14 20 in Code section 216A.136; the state public defender;  the
 14 21 department of human services; and the alleged victim of the
 14 22 delinquent act.
 14 23    PUBLIC RECORDS HEARINGS.  The bill enacts new Code section
 14 24 232.149B, which provides that a person may apply for a court
 14 25 order to make confidential juvenile court records public.
 14 26 The bill provides that a rebuttable presumption exists that
 14 27 official juvenile court records shall remain confidential. The
 14 28 bill provides that the court shall order the official juvenile
 14 29 court records in such a delinquency proceeding to be public
 14 30 records if either the public's interest in making the records
 14 31 public outweighs the juvenile's interest in maintaining the
 14 32 confidentiality of the records or the juvenile has been placed
 14 33 on youthful offender status pursuant to Code section 232.45(7)
 14 34 and Code section 907.3A(1), and will be transferred back to
 14 35 the district court for sentencing prior to the child's 18th
 15  1 birthday. The court may order the official juvenile court
 15  2 records in such a delinquency proceeding to be public records
 15  3 if the juvenile has been subsequently adjudicated delinquent
 15  4 for a public offense that would be a serious misdemeanor,
 15  5 aggravated misdemeanor, or felony offense if committed by an
 15  6 adult, or another delinquency proceeding is pending seeking
 15  7 such an adjudication. The bill provides that records subject
 15  8 to a public records order may be sealed at a later date
 15  9 pursuant to Code section 232.150.
 15 10    RIGHT TO REVIEW AND RELEASE A CONFIDENTIAL COMPLAINT.  The
 15 11 bill provides that delinquency complaints shall be released
 15 12 in accordance with Code section 915.25. Under current Code
 15 13 section 915.25, a complaint which alleges that a child who is
 15 14 at least 10 years of age committed a delinquent act, which if
 15 15 committed by an adult would be a public offense, is a public
 15 16 record. Current Code section 915.25 authorizes the court,
 15 17 its designee, or law enforcement officials to release such
 15 18 a complaint, including the identity of the child. The bill
 15 19 amends Code section 915.25 to provide that such a complaint
 15 20 is confidential unless the complaint alleges that the child
 15 21 committed a delinquent act that if committed by an adult would
 15 22 be a forcible felony. However, the bill authorizes state and
 15 23 local enforcement officials to release a confidential complaint
 15 24 against a child if the child is at large and doing so is deemed
 15 25 necessary for the protection of the public or the safety of
 15 26 the child. If the complaint is not confidential because the
 15 27 alleged delinquent act is an act that would be a forcible
 15 28 felony if committed by an adult, the court, its designee,
 15 29 or law enforcement officials may release such a complaint,
 15 30 including the identity of the child.
 15 31    The bill provides that an intake or juvenile court officer
 15 32 shall disclose to the alleged victim of a delinquent act, upon
 15 33 request, the complaint, the name and address of the child who
 15 34 allegedly committed the delinquent act, and the disposition
 15 35 of the complaint. If the alleged delinquent act would be
 16  1 a forcible felony if committed by an adult, the intake or
 16  2 juvenile court officer shall provide notification to the victim
 16  3 as required by Code section 915.24.
 16  4    SEALING OF JUVENILE COURT RECORDS UNAVAILABLE FOR
 16  5 OPERATING=WHILE=INTOXICATED VIOLATIONS.  Under current Code
 16  6 section 232.150, a court shall order juvenile court records
 16  7 to be sealed if the person who is the subject of the juvenile
 16  8 court records is 18 years of age or older and 2 years have
 16  9 elapsed since the last official action in the person's case,
 16 10 the person has not been subsequently convicted of a felony
 16 11 or an aggravated or serious misdemeanor or adjudicated a
 16 12 delinquent child for an act which if committed by an adult
 16 13 would be a felony, an aggravated misdemeanor, or a serious
 16 14 misdemeanor and no proceeding is pending seeking such
 16 15 conviction or adjudication, and the person was not placed on
 16 16 youthful offender status, transferred back to district court
 16 17 after the youthful offender's 18th birthday, and sentenced for
 16 18 the offense which precipitated the youthful offender placement.
 16 19 The bill in newly designated Code section 232.150(4) provides
 16 20 that the court shall not seal a person's juvenile court records
 16 21 if the person was adjudicated delinquent for violating Code
 16 22 section 321J.2, which prohibits the operation of a motor
 16 23 vehicle while under the influence of alcohol or a drug.
 16 24    RELEASE OF CONFIDENTIAL RECORDS.  The bill provides that a
 16 25 public record which is confidential under the provisions of
 16 26 Code chapter 232 shall only be subject to release upon order of
 16 27 a court in a proceeding under Code chapter 232.
 16 28    EXISTING CONFIDENTIALITY EXEMPTIONS.  The bill retains
 16 29 certain existing exemptions to confidentiality of juvenile
 16 30 court records. Pursuant to Code section 692A.121(8), records
 16 31 concerning sex offense convictions which are committed by
 16 32 minors may be released in the same manner as records of
 16 33 convictions of adults. Pursuant to Code section 915.10A,
 16 34 information concerning a juvenile charged with a felony offense
 16 35 may be released pursuant to an automated victim notification
 17  1 system. Under the bill, these exemptions to confidentiality
 17  2 are not amended and therefore still apply to juvenile court
 17  3 records.
 17  4    RIGHT TO COUNSEL.  The bill in Code section 232.11 provides
 17  5 that a child has the right to be represented by counsel at a
 17  6 hearing on a confidentiality order under Code section 232.149A
 17  7 or a public records order under Code section 232.149B.
 17  8    APPLICABILITY.  The bill applies to juvenile delinquency
 17  9 proceedings which are pending or arise on or after July 1,
 17 10 2016.

 10 35 juvenile court records in cases alleging delinquency are public
 11  1 records unless a judge either grants a request to make the
 11  2 records confidential or seals the records. The bill in Code
 11  3 section 232.147(3) provides that juvenile court records are
 11  4 confidential and therefore are not public records except in
 11  5 cases alleging the commission of a delinquent act that would be
 11  6 a forcible felony if committed by an adult. Under Code section
 11  7 702.11, a forcible felony is any felonious child endangerment,
 11  8 assault, murder, sexual abuse, kidnapping, robbery, human
 11  9 trafficking, arson in the first degree, or burglary in the
 11 10 first degree. If juvenile records are not confidential, the
 11 11 bill provides that a juvenile court officer may release such
 11 12 records.
 11 13    CONFIDENTIALITY ORDERS.  The bill in Code section 232.149A
 11 14 provides that a court shall order juvenile court records
 11 15 alleging the commission of a delinquent act that would be a
 11 16 forcible felony if committed by an adult to be confidential
 11 17 if the court finds that the case has been dismissed and the
 11 18 person is no longer subject to the jurisdiction of the juvenile
 11 19 court and that the child's interest in making the records
 11 20 confidential outweighs the public's interest in the records
 11 21 remaining public records.
 11 22    ACCESS TO CONFIDENTIAL JUVENILE RECORDS.  The bill and
 11 23 Code section 232.147(3) provide that unless an order sealing
 11 24 confidential juvenile records has been entered, confidential
 11 25 juvenile records may still be inspected, without a court
 11 26 order, by the judge and professional court staff, including
 11 27 juvenile court officers; the child and the child's counsel;
 11 28 the child's parent, guardian or custodian, court appointed
 11 29 special advocate, and guardian ad litem, and the members of
 11 30 the child advocacy board created in Code section 237.16 or a
 11 31 local citizen foster care review board created in accordance
 11 32 with Code section 237.19 who are assigning or reviewing the
 11 33 child's case; the county attorney and the county attorney's
 11 34 assistants; an agency, association, facility, or institution
 11 35 which has custody of the child, or is legally responsible for
 12  1 the care, treatment, or supervision of the child, including
 12  2 the department of human services; a court, court professional
 12  3 staff, and adult probation officers in connection with the
 12  4 preparation of a presentence report concerning a person
 12  5 who prior thereto had been the subject of a juvenile court
 12  6 delinquency proceeding; the child's foster parent or an
 12  7 individual providing preadoptive care to the child; the state
 12  8 public defender; the department of corrections; a judicial
 12  9 district department of correctional services; the board of
 12 10 parole; the superintendent or the superintendent's designee of
 12 11 the school district for the school attended by the child or
 12 12 the authorities in charge of an accredited nonpublic school
 12 13 attended by the child; a member of the armed forces of the
 12 14 United States who is conducting a background investigation of
 12 15 an individual pursuant to federal law; the statistical analysis
 12 16 center for the purposes stated in Code section 216A.136; a
 12 17 state or local law enforcement agency; and the alleged victim
 12 18 of any delinquent act in the proceeding.
 12 19    The bill in newly designated Code section 232.147(3A)
 12 20 provides that juvenile court records containing a petition or
 12 21 complaint alleging the commission of a delinquent act that
 12 22 would be a forcible felony if committed by an adult shall be
 12 23 public records unless subject to a confidentiality order under
 12 24 Code section 232.149A or a sealing order under Code section
 12 25 232.150.  However, the bill provides that such official records
 12 26 shall not be available to the public or any governmental
 12 27 agency through the internet or in an electronic customized
 12 28 data report unless the child has been adjudicated delinquent
 12 29 in the matter.  Nevertheless, the bill provides that official
 12 30 juvenile court records may be disclosed without a court order
 12 31 through the internet or in an electronic customized data
 12 32 report prior to the child being adjudicated delinquent to the
 12 33 judge and professional court staff, including juvenile court
 12 34 officers; the child's counsel or guardian ad litem; the county
 12 35 attorney and the county attorney's assistants; a court, court
 13  1 professional staff, and adult probation officers in connection
 13  2 with the preparation of a presentence report concerning a
 13  3 person who prior thereto had been the subject of a juvenile
 13  4 court proceeding; a state or local law enforcement agency; the
 13  5 state public defender; the statistical analysis center for
 13  6 the purposes stated in Code section 216A.136; the department
 13  7 of human services; the department of corrections; a judicial
 13  8 district department of correctional services; and the board of
 13  9 parole.
 13 10    CONFIDENTIALITY OF TRANSCRIPTS.  The bill in newly
 13 11 designated Code section 232.147(3B) provides that if the court
 13 12 has excluded the public from a hearing pursuant to Code section
 13 13 232.39 or 232.92, the transcript of the proceedings shall not
 13 14 be deemed a public record and inspection and disclosure of
 13 15 the contents of the transcript shall not be permitted except
 13 16 pursuant to a court order or unless otherwise provided in Code
 13 17 chapter 232.
 13 18    USE OF ADJUDICATION OF DELINQUENCY FOR PENALTY ENHANCEMENTS
 13 19 OR EVIDENCE.  The bill in newly designated Code section
 13 20 232.147(13) provides that the confidentiality of a final
 13 21 adjudication of delinquency under Code section 232.147 or
 13 22 pursuant to Code section 232.149A shall not prohibit the state
 13 23 from pleading or proving the adjudication at a subsequent
 13 24 criminal or delinquency proceeding for the purpose of penalty
 13 25 enhancement when a provision of the Code specifically deems the
 13 26 delinquency adjudication to constitute a final conviction.
 13 27    The bill in newly designated Code section 232.147(14)
 13 28 provides that the provisions of the bill shall not be construed
 13 29 to limit or restrict the production, use, or introduction
 13 30 of official juvenile court records in any juvenile or adult
 13 31 criminal proceeding, where such records are relevant and deemed
 13 32 admissible under any other provision of the law.
 13 33    CONFIDENTIALITY OF RECORDS AND FILES OF CRIMINAL OR
 13 34 JUVENILE JUSTICE AGENCIES.  Under current law, records and
 13 35 files of a criminal or juvenile justice agency concerning
 14  1 a child involved in a delinquent act are public records,
 14  2 subject to certain exceptions. The bill in Code section
 14  3 232.149 provides that the records and files of a criminal or
 14  4 juvenile justice agency, an intake officer, or a juvenile court
 14  5 officer concerning a child involved in a delinquent act are
 14  6 confidential. The bill further provides that the records of an
 14  7 intake officer or juvenile court officer containing a dismissal
 14  8 of a complaint or an informal adjustment of a complaint when
 14  9 no petition is filed relating to the complaint, shall not be
 14 10 available to the public, but may be disclosed to the judge and
 14 11 professional court staff, including juvenile court officers;
 14 12 the child's counsel or guardian ad litem; the county attorney
 14 13 and county attorney's assistants;  the superintendent or the
 14 14 superintendent's designee of the school district for the
 14 15 school attended by the child or the authorities in charge of

 14 17 of the armed forces of the United States who is conducting a
 14 18 background investigation of an individual pursuant to federal
 14 19 law; the statistical analysis center for the purposes stated
 14 20 in Code section 216A.136; the state public defender;  the
 14 21 department of human services; and the alleged victim of the
 14 22 delinquent act.
 14 23    PUBLIC RECORDS HEARINGS.  The bill enacts new Code section
 14 24 232.149B, which provides that a person may apply for a court
 14 25 order to make confidential juvenile court records public.
 14 26 The bill provides that a rebuttable presumption exists that
 14 27 official juvenile court records shall remain confidential. The
 14 28 bill provides that the court shall order the official juvenile
 14 29 court records in such a delinquency proceeding to be public
 14 30 records if either the public's interest in making the records
 14 31 public outweighs the juvenile's interest in maintaining the
 14 32 confidentiality of the records or the juvenile has been placed
 14 33 on youthful offender status pursuant to Code section 232.45(7)
 14 34 and Code section 907.3A(1), and will be transferred back to
 14 35 the district court for sentencing prior to the child's 18th
 15  1 birthday. The court may order the official juvenile court
 15  2 records in such a delinquency proceeding to be public records
 15  3 if the juvenile has been subsequently adjudicated delinquent
 15  4 for a public offense that would be a serious misdemeanor,
 15  5 aggravated misdemeanor, or felony offense if committed by an
 15  6 adult, or another delinquency proceeding is pending seeking
 15  7 such an adjudication. The bill provides that records subject
 15  8 to a public records order may be sealed at a later date
 15  9 pursuant to Code section 232.150.
 15 10    RIGHT TO REVIEW AND RELEASE A CONFIDENTIAL COMPLAINT.  The
 15 11 bill provides that delinquency complaints shall be released
 15 12 in accordance with Code section 915.25. Under current Code
 15 13 section 915.25, a complaint which alleges that a child who is
 15 14 at least 10 years of age committed a delinquent act, which if
 15 15 committed by an adult would be a public offense, is a public
 15 16 record. Current Code section 915.25 authorizes the court,
 15 17 its designee, or law enforcement officials to release such
 15 18 a complaint, including the identity of the child. The bill
 15 19 amends Code section 915.25 to provide that such a complaint
 15 20 is confidential unless the complaint alleges that the child
 15 21 committed a delinquent act that if committed by an adult would
 15 22 be a forcible felony. However, the bill authorizes state and
 15 23 local enforcement officials to release a confidential complaint
 15 24 against a child if the child is at large and doing so is deemed
 15 25 necessary for the protection of the public or the safety of
 15 26 the child. If the complaint is not confidential because the
 15 27 alleged delinquent act is an act that would be a forcible
 15 28 felony if committed by an adult, the court, its designee,
 15 29 or law enforcement officials may release such a complaint,
 15 30 including the identity of the child.
 15 31    The bill provides that an intake or juvenile court officer
 15 32 shall disclose to the alleged victim of a delinquent act, upon
 15 33 request, the complaint, the name and address of the child who
 15 34 allegedly committed the delinquent act, and the disposition
 15 35 of the complaint. If the alleged delinquent act would be
 16  1 a forcible felony if committed by an adult, the intake or
 16  2 juvenile court officer shall provide notification to the victim
 16  3 as required by Code section 915.24.
 16  4    SEALING OF JUVENILE COURT RECORDS UNAVAILABLE FOR
 16  5 OPERATING=WHILE=INTOXICATED VIOLATIONS.  Under current Code
 16  6 section 232.150, a court shall order juvenile court records
 16  7 to be sealed if the person who is the subject of the juvenile
 16  8 court records is 18 years of age or older and 2 years have
 16  9 elapsed since the last official action in the person's case,
 16 10 the person has not been subsequently convicted of a felony
 16 11 or an aggravated or serious misdemeanor or adjudicated a
 16 12 delinquent child for an act which if committed by an adult
 16 13 would be a felony, an aggravated misdemeanor, or a serious
 16 14 misdemeanor and no proceeding is pending seeking such
 16 15 conviction or adjudication, and the person was not placed on
 16 16 youthful offender status, transferred back to district court
 16 17 after the youthful offender's 18th birthday, and sentenced for
 16 18 the offense which precipitated the youthful offender placement.
 16 19 The bill in newly designated Code section 232.150(4) provides
 16 20 that the court shall not seal a person's juvenile court records
 16 21 if the person was adjudicated delinquent for violating Code
 16 22 section 321J.2, which prohibits the operation of a motor
 16 23 vehicle while under the influence of alcohol or a drug.
 16 24    RELEASE OF CONFIDENTIAL RECORDS.  The bill provides that a
 16 25 public record which is confidential under the provisions of
 16 26 Code chapter 232 shall only be subject to release upon order of
 16 27 a court in a proceeding under Code chapter 232.
 16 28    EXISTING CONFIDENTIALITY EXEMPTIONS.  The bill retains
 16 29 certain existing exemptions to confidentiality of juvenile
 16 30 court records. Pursuant to Code section 692A.121(8), records
 16 31 concerning sex offense convictions which are committed by
 16 32 minors may be released in the same manner as records of
 16 33 convictions of adults. Pursuant to Code section 915.10A,
 16 34 information concerning a juvenile charged with a felony offense
 16 35 may be released pursuant to an automated victim notification
 17  1 system. Under the bill, these exemptions to confidentiality
 17  2 are not amended and therefore still apply to juvenile court
 17  3 records.
 17  4    RIGHT TO COUNSEL.  The bill in Code section 232.11 provides
 17  5 that a child has the right to be represented by counsel at a

 17  7 or a public records order under Code section 232.149B.

 11  1 records unless a judge either grants a request to make the
 11  2 records confidential or seals the records. The bill in Code
 11  3 section 232.147(3) provides that juvenile court records are
 11  4 confidential and therefore are not public records except in
 11  5 cases alleging the commission of a delinquent act that would be
 11  6 a forcible felony if committed by an adult. Under Code section
 11  7 702.11, a forcible felony is any felonious child endangerment,
 11  8 assault, murder, sexual abuse, kidnapping, robbery, human
 11  9 trafficking, arson in the first degree, or burglary in the
 11 10 first degree. If juvenile records are not confidential, the
 11 11 bill provides that a juvenile court officer may release such
 11 12 records.
 11 13    CONFIDENTIALITY ORDERS.  The bill in Code section 232.149A
 11 14 provides that a court shall order juvenile court records
 11 15 alleging the commission of a delinquent act that would be a
 11 16 forcible felony if committed by an adult to be confidential
 11 17 if the court finds that the case has been dismissed and the

 11 20 confidential outweighs the public's interest in the records
 11 21 remaining public records.
 11 22    ACCESS TO CONFIDENTIAL JUVENILE RECORDS.  The bill and
 11 23 Code section 232.147(3) provide that unless an order sealing
 11 24 confidential juvenile records has been entered, confidential
 11 25 juvenile records may still be inspected, without a court
 11 26 order, by the judge and professional court staff, including
 11 27 juvenile court officers; the child and the child's counsel;

 12 20 provides that juvenile court records containing a petition or
 12 21 complaint alleging the commission of a delinquent act that
 12 22 would be a forcible felony if committed by an adult shall be
 12 23 public records unless subject to a confidentiality order under
 12 24 Code section 232.149A or a sealing order under Code section
 12 25 232.150.  However, the bill provides that such official records
 12 26 shall not be available to the public or any governmental
 12 27 agency through the internet or in an electronic customized
 12 28 data report unless the child has been adjudicated delinquent
 12 29 in the matter.  Nevertheless, the bill provides that official
 12 30 juvenile court records may be disclosed without a court order
 12 31 through the internet or in an electronic customized data
 12 32 report prior to the child being adjudicated delinquent to the
 12 33 judge and professional court staff, including juvenile court
 12 34 officers; the child's counsel or guardian ad litem; the county
 12 35 attorney and the county attorney's assistants; a court, court
 13  1 professional staff, and adult probation officers in connection
 13  2 with the preparation of a presentence report concerning a
 13  3 person who prior thereto had been the subject of a juvenile
 13  4 court proceeding; a state or local law enforcement agency; the
 13  5 state public defender; the statistical analysis center for
 13  6 the purposes stated in Code section 216A.136; the department
 13  7 of human services; the department of corrections; a judicial
 13  8 district department of correctional services; and the board of
 13  9 parole.
 13 10    CONFIDENTIALITY OF TRANSCRIPTS.  The bill in newly
 13 11 designated Code section 232.147(3B) provides that if the court
 13 12 has excluded the public from a hearing pursuant to Code section
 13 13 232.39 or 232.92, the transcript of the proceedings shall not
 13 14 be deemed a public record and inspection and disclosure of
 13 15 the contents of the transcript shall not be permitted except
 13 16 pursuant to a court order or unless otherwise provided in Code
 13 17 chapter 232.
 13 18    USE OF ADJUDICATION OF DELINQUENCY FOR PENALTY ENHANCEMENTS
 13 19 OR EVIDENCE.  The bill in newly designated Code section
 13 20 232.147(13) provides that the confidentiality of a final
 13 21 adjudication of delinquency under Code section 232.147 or
 13 22 pursuant to Code section 232.149A shall not prohibit the state
 13 23 from pleading or proving the adjudication at a subsequent
 13 24 criminal or delinquency proceeding for the purpose of penalty
 13 25 enhancement when a provision of the Code specifically deems the
 13 26 delinquency adjudication to constitute a final conviction.
 13 27    The bill in newly designated Code section 232.147(14)
 13 28 provides that the provisions of the bill shall not be construed
 13 29 to limit or restrict the production, use, or introduction
 13 30 of official juvenile court records in any juvenile or adult
 13 31 criminal proceeding, where such records are relevant and deemed
 13 32 admissible under any other provision of the law.
 13 33    CONFIDENTIALITY OF RECORDS AND FILES OF CRIMINAL OR
 13 34 JUVENILE JUSTICE AGENCIES.  Under current law, records and
 13 35 files of a criminal or juvenile justice agency concerning
 14  1 a child involved in a delinquent act are public records,
 14  2 subject to certain exceptions. The bill in Code section
 14  3 232.149 provides that the records and files of a criminal or
 14  4 juvenile justice agency, an intake officer, or a juvenile court
 14  5 officer concerning a child involved in a delinquent act are
 14  6 confidential. The bill further provides that the records of an
 14  7 intake officer or juvenile court officer containing a dismissal
 14  8 of a complaint or an informal adjustment of a complaint when
 14  9 no petition is filed relating to the complaint, shall not be
 14 10 available to the public, but may be disclosed to the judge and
 14 11 professional court staff, including juvenile court officers;
 14 12 the child's counsel or guardian ad litem; the county attorney
 14 13 and county attorney's assistants;  the superintendent or the
 14 14 superintendent's designee of the school district for the
 14 15 school attended by the child or the authorities in charge of
 14 16 an accredited nonpublic school attended by the child; a member
 14 17 of the armed forces of the United States who is conducting a
 14 18 background investigation of an individual pursuant to federal
 14 19 law; the statistical analysis center for the purposes stated
 14 20 in Code section 216A.136; the state public defender;  the
 14 21 department of human services; and the alleged victim of the
 14 22 delinquent act.
 14 23    PUBLIC RECORDS HEARINGS.  The bill enacts new Code section
 14 24 232.149B, which provides that a person may apply for a court
 14 25 order to make confidential juvenile court records public.
 14 26 The bill provides that a rebuttable presumption exists that
 14 27 official juvenile court records shall remain confidential. The
 14 28 bill provides that the court shall order the official juvenile
 14 29 court records in such a delinquency proceeding to be public
 14 30 records if either the public's interest in making the records
 14 31 public outweighs the juvenile's interest in maintaining the
 14 32 confidentiality of the records or the juvenile has been placed
 14 33 on youthful offender status pursuant to Code section 232.45(7)
 14 34 and Code section 907.3A(1), and will be transferred back to
 14 35 the district court for sentencing prior to the child's 18th
 15  1 birthday. The court may order the official juvenile court
 15  2 records in such a delinquency proceeding to be public records
 15  3 if the juvenile has been subsequently adjudicated delinquent
 15  4 for a public offense that would be a serious misdemeanor,
 15  5 aggravated misdemeanor, or felony offense if committed by an
 15  6 adult, or another delinquency proceeding is pending seeking
 15  7 such an adjudication. The bill provides that records subject
 15  8 to a public records order may be sealed at a later date
 15  9 pursuant to Code section 232.150.
 15 10    RIGHT TO REVIEW AND RELEASE A CONFIDENTIAL COMPLAINT.  The
 15 11 bill provides that delinquency complaints shall be released
 15 12 in accordance with Code section 915.25. Under current Code
 15 13 section 915.25, a complaint which alleges that a child who is
 15 14 at least 10 years of age committed a delinquent act, which if
 15 15 committed by an adult would be a public offense, is a public
 15 16 record. Current Code section 915.25 authorizes the court,
 15 17 its designee, or law enforcement officials to release such
 15 18 a complaint, including the identity of the child. The bill
 15 19 amends Code section 915.25 to provide that such a complaint
 15 20 is confidential unless the complaint alleges that the child
 15 21 committed a delinquent act that if committed by an adult would
 15 22 be a forcible felony. However, the bill authorizes state and
 15 23 local enforcement officials to release a confidential complaint
 15 24 against a child if the child is at large and doing so is deemed
 15 25 necessary for the protection of the public or the safety of
 15 26 the child. If the complaint is not confidential because the
 15 27 alleged delinquent act is an act that would be a forcible
 15 28 felony if committed by an adult, the court, its designee,
 15 29 or law enforcement officials may release such a complaint,
 15 30 including the identity of the child.
 15 31    The bill provides that an intake or juvenile court officer
 15 32 shall disclose to the alleged victim of a delinquent act, upon
 15 33 request, the complaint, the name and address of the child who
 15 34 allegedly committed the delinquent act, and the disposition
 15 35 of the complaint. If the alleged delinquent act would be
 16  1 a forcible felony if committed by an adult, the intake or
 16  2 juvenile court officer shall provide notification to the victim
 16  3 as required by Code section 915.24.
 16  4    SEALING OF JUVENILE COURT RECORDS UNAVAILABLE FOR
 16  5 OPERATING=WHILE=INTOXICATED VIOLATIONS.  Under current Code
 16  6 section 232.150, a court shall order juvenile court records
 16  7 to be sealed if the person who is the subject of the juvenile
 16  8 court records is 18 years of age or older and 2 years have
 16  9 elapsed since the last official action in the person's case,
 16 10 the person has not been subsequently convicted of a felony
 16 11 or an aggravated or serious misdemeanor or adjudicated a
 16 12 delinquent child for an act which if committed by an adult
 16 13 would be a felony, an aggravated misdemeanor, or a serious
 16 14 misdemeanor and no proceeding is pending seeking such
 16 15 conviction or adjudication, and the person was not placed on
 16 16 youthful offender status, transferred back to district court
 16 17 after the youthful offender's 18th birthday, and sentenced for
 16 18 the offense which precipitated the youthful offender placement.
 16 19 The bill in newly designated Code section 232.150(4) provides
 16 20 that the court shall not seal a person's juvenile court records
 16 21 if the person was adjudicated delinquent for violating Code
 16 22 section 321J.2, which prohibits the operation of a motor
 16 23 vehicle while under the influence of alcohol or a drug.
 16 24    RELEASE OF CONFIDENTIAL RECORDS.  The bill provides that a
 16 25 public record which is confidential under the provisions of
 16 26 Code chapter 232 shall only be subject to release upon order of
 16 27 a court in a proceeding under Code chapter 232.
 16 28    EXISTING CONFIDENTIALITY EXEMPTIONS.  The bill retains
 16 29 certain existing exemptions to confidentiality of juvenile
 16 30 court records. Pursuant to Code section 692A.121(8), records
 16 31 concerning sex offense convictions which are committed by
 16 32 minors may be released in the same manner as records of
 16 33 convictions of adults. Pursuant to Code section 915.10A,
 16 34 information concerning a juvenile charged with a felony offense
 16 35 may be released pursuant to an automated victim notification
 17  1 system. Under the bill, these exemptions to confidentiality
 17  2 are not amended and therefore still apply to juvenile court
 17  3 records.
 17  4    RIGHT TO COUNSEL.  The bill in Code section 232.11 provides
 17  5 that a child has the right to be represented by counsel at a
 17  6 hearing on a confidentiality order under Code section 232.149A
 17  7 or a public records order under Code section 232.149B.
 17  8    APPLICABILITY.  The bill applies to juvenile delinquency
 17  9 proceedings which are pending or arise on or after July 1,
 17 10 2016.
       LSB 5193HV (4) 86

 11  2 records confidential or seals the records. The bill in Code
 11  3 section 232.147(3) provides that juvenile court records are
 11  4 confidential and therefore are not public records except in
 11  5 cases alleging the commission of a delinquent act that would be
 11  6 a forcible felony if committed by an adult. Under Code section
 11  7 702.11, a forcible felony is any felonious child endangerment,
 11  8 assault, murder, sexual abuse, kidnapping, robbery, human
 11  9 trafficking, arson in the first degree, or burglary in the
 11 10 first degree. If juvenile records are not confidential, the
 11 11 bill provides that a juvenile court officer may release such
 11 12 records.
 11 13    CONFIDENTIALITY ORDERS.  The bill in Code section 232.149A
 11 14 provides that a court shall order juvenile court records
 11 15 alleging the commission of a delinquent act that would be a
 11 16 forcible felony if committed by an adult to be confidential
 11 17 if the court finds that the case has been dismissed and the
 11 18 person is no longer subject to the jurisdiction of the juvenile
 11 19 court and that the child's interest in making the records
 11 20 confidential outweighs the public's interest in the records
 11 21 remaining public records.
 11 22    ACCESS TO CONFIDENTIAL JUVENILE RECORDS.  The bill and
 11 23 Code section 232.147(3) provide that unless an order sealing
 11 24 confidential juvenile records has been entered, confidential
 11 25 juvenile records may still be inspected, without a court
 11 26 order, by the judge and professional court staff, including
 11 27 juvenile court officers; the child and the child's counsel;
 11 28 the child's parent, guardian or custodian, court appointed
 11 29 special advocate, and guardian ad litem, and the members of
 11 30 the child advocacy board created in Code section 237.16 or a
 11 31 local citizen foster care review board created in accordance
 11 32 with Code section 237.19 who are assigning or reviewing the
 11 33 child's case; the county attorney and the county attorney's
 11 34 assistants; an agency, association, facility, or institution
 11 35 which has custody of the child, or is legally responsible for
 12  1 the care, treatment, or supervision of the child, including
 12  2 the department of human services; a court, court professional
 12  3 staff, and adult probation officers in connection with the
 12  4 preparation of a presentence report concerning a person
 12  5 who prior thereto had been the subject of a juvenile court
 12  6 delinquency proceeding; the child's foster parent or an
 12  7 individual providing preadoptive care to the child; the state
 12  8 public defender; the department of corrections; a judicial
 12  9 district department of correctional services; the board of
 12 10 parole; the superintendent or the superintendent's designee of
 12 11 the school district for the school attended by the child or
 12 12 the authorities in charge of an accredited nonpublic school
 12 13 attended by the child; a member of the armed forces of the
 12 14 United States who is conducting a background investigation of
 12 15 an individual pursuant to federal law; the statistical analysis
 12 16 center for the purposes stated in Code section 216A.136; a
 12 17 state or local law enforcement agency; and the alleged victim
 12 18 of any delinquent act in the proceeding.
 12 19    The bill in newly designated Code section 232.147(3A)
 12 20 provides that juvenile court records containing a petition or
 12 21 complaint alleging the commission of a delinquent act that
 12 22 would be a forcible felony if committed by an adult shall be
 12 23 public records unless subject to a confidentiality order under
 12 24 Code section 232.149A or a sealing order under Code section
 12 25 232.150.  However, the bill provides that such official records
 12 26 shall not be available to the public or any governmental
 12 27 agency through the internet or in an electronic customized
 12 28 data report unless the child has been adjudicated delinquent
 12 29 in the matter.  Nevertheless, the bill provides that official
 12 30 juvenile court records may be disclosed without a court order
 12 31 through the internet or in an electronic customized data
 12 32 report prior to the child being adjudicated delinquent to the
 12 33 judge and professional court staff, including juvenile court
 12 34 officers; the child's counsel or guardian ad litem; the county
 12 35 attorney and the county attorney's assistants; a court, court
 13  1 professional staff, and adult probation officers in connection
 13  2 with the preparation of a presentence report concerning a
 13  3 person who prior thereto had been the subject of a juvenile
 13  4 court proceeding; a state or local law enforcement agency; the
 13  5 state public defender; the statistical analysis center for
 13  6 the purposes stated in Code section 216A.136; the department
 13  7 of human services; the department of corrections; a judicial
 13  8 district department of correctional services; and the board of
 13  9 parole.
 13 10    CONFIDENTIALITY OF TRANSCRIPTS.  The bill in newly
 13 11 designated Code section 232.147(3B) provides that if the court
 13 12 has excluded the public from a hearing pursuant to Code section
 13 13 232.39 or 232.92, the transcript of the proceedings shall not
 13 14 be deemed a public record and inspection and disclosure of
 13 15 the contents of the transcript shall not be permitted except
 13 16 pursuant to a court order or unless otherwise provided in Code
 13 17 chapter 232.
 13 18    USE OF ADJUDICATION OF DELINQUENCY FOR PENALTY ENHANCEMENTS
 13 19 OR EVIDENCE.  The bill in newly designated Code section
 13 20 232.147(13) provides that the confidentiality of a final
 13 21 adjudication of delinquency under Code section 232.147 or
 13 22 pursuant to Code section 232.149A shall not prohibit the state
 13 23 from pleading or proving the adjudication at a subsequent
 13 24 criminal or delinquency proceeding for the purpose of penalty
 13 25 enhancement when a provision of the Code specifically deems the
 13 26 delinquency adjudication to constitute a final conviction.
 13 27    The bill in newly designated Code section 232.147(14)
 13 28 provides that the provisions of the bill shall not be construed
 13 29 to limit or restrict the production, use, or introduction
 13 30 of official juvenile court records in any juvenile or adult
 13 31 criminal proceeding, where such records are relevant and deemed
 13 32 admissible under any other provision of the law.
 13 33    CONFIDENTIALITY OF RECORDS AND FILES OF CRIMINAL OR
 13 34 JUVENILE JUSTICE AGENCIES.  Under current law, records and
 13 35 files of a criminal or juvenile justice agency concerning
 14  1 a child involved in a delinquent act are public records,
 14  2 subject to certain exceptions. The bill in Code section
 14  3 232.149 provides that the records and files of a criminal or
 14  4 juvenile justice agency, an intake officer, or a juvenile court
 14  5 officer concerning a child involved in a delinquent act are
 14  6 confidential. The bill further provides that the records of an
 14  7 intake officer or juvenile court officer containing a dismissal
 14  8 of a complaint or an informal adjustment of a complaint when
 14  9 no petition is filed relating to the complaint, shall not be
 14 10 available to the public, but may be disclosed to the judge and
 14 11 professional court staff, including juvenile court officers;
 14 12 the child's counsel or guardian ad litem; the county attorney
 14 13 and county attorney's assistants;  the superintendent or the
 14 14 superintendent's designee of the school district for the
 14 15 school attended by the child or the authorities in charge of
 14 16 an accredited nonpublic school attended by the child; a member
 14 17 of the armed forces of the United States who is conducting a
 14 18 background investigation of an individual pursuant to federal
 14 19 law; the statistical analysis center for the purposes stated
 14 20 in Code section 216A.136; the state public defender;  the
 14 21 department of human services; and the alleged victim of the
 14 22 delinquent act.
 14 23    PUBLIC RECORDS HEARINGS.  The bill enacts new Code section
 14 24 232.149B, which provides that a person may apply for a court
 14 25 order to make confidential juvenile court records public.
 14 26 The bill provides that a rebuttable presumption exists that
 14 27 official juvenile court records shall remain confidential. The
 14 28 bill provides that the court shall order the official juvenile
 14 29 court records in such a delinquency proceeding to be public
 14 30 records if either the public's interest in making the records
 14 31 public outweighs the juvenile's interest in maintaining the
 14 32 confidentiality of the records or the juvenile has been placed
 14 33 on youthful offender status pursuant to Code section 232.45(7)
 14 34 and Code section 907.3A(1), and will be transferred back to
 14 35 the district court for sentencing prior to the child's 18th
 15  1 birthday. The court may order the official juvenile court
 15  2 records in such a delinquency proceeding to be public records
 15  3 if the juvenile has been subsequently adjudicated delinquent
 15  4 for a public offense that would be a serious misdemeanor,
 15  5 aggravated misdemeanor, or felony offense if committed by an
 15  6 adult, or another delinquency proceeding is pending seeking
 15  7 such an adjudication. The bill provides that records subject
 15  8 to a public records order may be sealed at a later date
 15  9 pursuant to Code section 232.150.
 15 10    RIGHT TO REVIEW AND RELEASE A CONFIDENTIAL COMPLAINT.  The
 15 11 bill provides that delinquency complaints shall be released
 15 12 in accordance with Code section 915.25. Under current Code
 15 13 section 915.25, a complaint which alleges that a child who is
 15 14 at least 10 years of age committed a delinquent act, which if
 15 15 committed by an adult would be a public offense, is a public
 15 16 record. Current Code section 915.25 authorizes the court,
 15 17 its designee, or law enforcement officials to release such
 15 18 a complaint, including the identity of the child. The bill
 15 19 amends Code section 915.25 to provide that such a complaint
 15 20 is confidential unless the complaint alleges that the child
 15 21 committed a delinquent act that if committed by an adult would
 15 22 be a forcible felony. However, the bill authorizes state and
 15 23 local enforcement officials to release a confidential complaint
 15 24 against a child if the child is at large and doing so is deemed
 15 25 necessary for the protection of the public or the safety of
 15 26 the child. If the complaint is not confidential because the
 15 27 alleged delinquent act is an act that would be a forcible
 15 28 felony if committed by an adult, the court, its designee,
 15 29 or law enforcement officials may release such a complaint,
 15 30 including the identity of the child.
 15 31    The bill provides that an intake or juvenile court officer
 15 32 shall disclose to the alleged victim of a delinquent act, upon
 15 33 request, the complaint, the name and address of the child who
 15 34 allegedly committed the delinquent act, and the disposition
 15 35 of the complaint. If the alleged delinquent act would be
 16  1 a forcible felony if committed by an adult, the intake or
 16  2 juvenile court officer shall provide notification to the victim
 16  3 as required by Code section 915.24.
 16  4    SEALING OF JUVENILE COURT RECORDS UNAVAILABLE FOR
 16  5 OPERATING=WHILE=INTOXICATED VIOLATIONS.  Under current Code
 16  6 section 232.150, a court shall order juvenile court records
 16  7 to be sealed if the person who is the subject of the juvenile
 16  8 court records is 18 years of age or older and 2 years have
 16  9 elapsed since the last official action in the person's case,
 16 10 the person has not been subsequently convicted of a felony
 16 11 or an aggravated or serious misdemeanor or adjudicated a
 16 12 delinquent child for an act which if committed by an adult
 16 13 would be a felony, an aggravated misdemeanor, or a serious
 16 14 misdemeanor and no proceeding is pending seeking such
 16 15 conviction or adjudication, and the person was not placed on
 16 16 youthful offender status, transferred back to district court
 16 17 after the youthful offender's 18th birthday, and sentenced for
 16 18 the offense which precipitated the youthful offender placement.
 16 19 The bill in newly designated Code section 232.150(4) provides
 16 20 that the court shall not seal a person's juvenile court records
 16 21 if the person was adjudicated delinquent for violating Code
 16 22 section 321J.2, which prohibits the operation of a motor
 16 23 vehicle while under the influence of alcohol or a drug.
 16 24    RELEASE OF CONFIDENTIAL RECORDS.  The bill provides that a
 16 25 public record which is confidential under the provisions of
 16 26 Code chapter 232 shall only be subject to release upon order of
 16 27 a court in a proceeding under Code chapter 232.
 16 28    EXISTING CONFIDENTIALITY EXEMPTIONS.  The bill retains
 16 29 certain existing exemptions to confidentiality of juvenile
 16 30 court records. Pursuant to Code section 692A.121(8), records
 16 31 concerning sex offense convictions which are committed by
 16 32 minors may be released in the same manner as records of
 16 33 convictions of adults. Pursuant to Code section 915.10A,
 16 34 information concerning a juvenile charged with a felony offense
 16 35 may be released pursuant to an automated victim notification
 17  1 system. Under the bill, these exemptions to confidentiality
 17  2 are not amended and therefore still apply to juvenile court
 17  3 records.
 17  4    RIGHT TO COUNSEL.  The bill in Code section 232.11 provides
 17  5 that a child has the right to be represented by counsel at a
 17  6 hearing on a confidentiality order under Code section 232.149A
 17  7 or a public records order under Code section 232.149B.
 17  8    APPLICABILITY.  The bill applies to juvenile delinquency
 17  9 proceedings which are pending or arise on or after July 1,

 11  3 section 232.147(3) provides that juvenile court records are
 11  4 confidential and therefore are not public records except in
 11  5 cases alleging the commission of a delinquent act that would be
 11  6 a forcible felony if committed by an adult. Under Code section
 11  7 702.11, a forcible felony is any felonious child endangerment,
 11  8 assault, murder, sexual abuse, kidnapping, robbery, human
 11  9 trafficking, arson in the first degree, or burglary in the
 11 10 first degree. If juvenile records are not confidential, the
 11 11 bill provides that a juvenile court officer may release such
 11 12 records.
 11 13    CONFIDENTIALITY ORDERS.  The bill in Code section 232.149A
 11 14 provides that a court shall order juvenile court records
 11 15 alleging the commission of a delinquent act that would be a
 11 16 forcible felony if committed by an adult to be confidential
 11 17 if the court finds that the case has been dismissed and the
 11 18 person is no longer subject to the jurisdiction of the juvenile
 11 19 court and that the child's interest in making the records
 11 20 confidential outweighs the public's interest in the records
 11 21 remaining public records.
 11 22    ACCESS TO CONFIDENTIAL JUVENILE RECORDS.  The bill and
 11 23 Code section 232.147(3) provide that unless an order sealing
 11 24 confidential juvenile records has been entered, confidential
 11 25 juvenile records may still be inspected, without a court
 11 26 order, by the judge and professional court staff, including
 11 27 juvenile court officers; the child and the child's counsel;
 11 28 the child's parent, guardian or custodian, court appointed
 11 29 special advocate, and guardian ad litem, and the members of
 11 30 the child advocacy board created in Code section 237.16 or a
 11 31 local citizen foster care review board created in accordance
 11 32 with Code section 237.19 who are assigning or reviewing the
 11 33 child's case; the county attorney and the county attorney's
 11 34 assistants; an agency, association, facility, or institution
 11 35 which has custody of the child, or is legally responsible for
 12  1 the care, treatment, or supervision of the child, including
 12  2 the department of human services; a court, court professional
 12  3 staff, and adult probation officers in connection with the
 12  4 preparation of a presentence report concerning a person
 12  5 who prior thereto had been the subject of a juvenile court
 12  6 delinquency proceeding; the child's foster parent or an
 12  7 individual providing preadoptive care to the child; the state
 12  8 public defender; the department of corrections; a judicial
 12  9 district department of correctional services; the board of
 12 10 parole; the superintendent or the superintendent's designee of
 12 11 the school district for the school attended by the child or
 12 12 the authorities in charge of an accredited nonpublic school
 12 13 attended by the child; a member of the armed forces of the
 12 14 United States who is conducting a background investigation of
 12 15 an individual pursuant to federal law; the statistical analysis
 12 16 center for the purposes stated in Code section 216A.136; a
 12 17 state or local law enforcement agency; and the alleged victim
 12 18 of any delinquent act in the proceeding.
 12 19    The bill in newly designated Code section 232.147(3A)
 12 20 provides that juvenile court records containing a petition or
 12 21 complaint alleging the commission of a delinquent act that
 12 22 would be a forcible felony if committed by an adult shall be
 12 23 public records unless subject to a confidentiality order under
 12 24 Code section 232.149A or a sealing order under Code section
 12 25 232.150.  However, the bill provides that such official records
 12 26 shall not be available to the public or any governmental
 12 27 agency through the internet or in an electronic customized
 12 28 data report unless the child has been adjudicated delinquent
 12 29 in the matter.  Nevertheless, the bill provides that official
 12 30 juvenile court records may be disclosed without a court order
 12 31 through the internet or in an electronic customized data
 12 32 report prior to the child being adjudicated delinquent to the
 12 33 judge and professional court staff, including juvenile court
 12 34 officers; the child's counsel or guardian ad litem; the county
 12 35 attorney and the county attorney's assistants; a court, court
 13  1 professional staff, and adult probation officers in connection
 13  2 with the preparation of a presentence report concerning a
 13  3 person who prior thereto had been the subject of a juvenile
 13  4 court proceeding; a state or local law enforcement agency; the
 13  5 state public defender; the statistical analysis center for
 13  6 the purposes stated in Code section 216A.136; the department
 13  7 of human services; the department of corrections; a judicial
 13  8 district department of correctional services; and the board of
 13  9 parole.
 13 10    CONFIDENTIALITY OF TRANSCRIPTS.  The bill in newly
 13 11 designated Code section 232.147(3B) provides that if the court
 13 12 has excluded the public from a hearing pursuant to Code section
 13 13 232.39 or 232.92, the transcript of the proceedings shall not
 13 14 be deemed a public record and inspection and disclosure of
 13 15 the contents of the transcript shall not be permitted except
 13 16 pursuant to a court order or unless otherwise provided in Code
 13 17 chapter 232.
 13 18    USE OF ADJUDICATION OF DELINQUENCY FOR PENALTY ENHANCEMENTS
 13 19 OR EVIDENCE.  The bill in newly designated Code section
 13 20 232.147(13) provides that the confidentiality of a final
 13 21 adjudication of delinquency under Code section 232.147 or
 13 22 pursuant to Code section 232.149A shall not prohibit the state
 13 23 from pleading or proving the adjudication at a subsequent
 13 24 criminal or delinquency proceeding for the purpose of penalty
 13 25 enhancement when a provision of the Code specifically deems the
 13 26 delinquency adjudication to constitute a final conviction.
 13 27    The bill in newly designated Code section 232.147(14)
 13 28 provides that the provisions of the bill shall not be construed
 13 29 to limit or restrict the production, use, or introduction
 13 30 of official juvenile court records in any juvenile or adult
 13 31 criminal proceeding, where such records are relevant and deemed
 13 32 admissible under any other provision of the law.
 13 33    CONFIDENTIALITY OF RECORDS AND FILES OF CRIMINAL OR
 13 34 JUVENILE JUSTICE AGENCIES.  Under current law, records and
 13 35 files of a criminal or juvenile justice agency concerning
 14  1 a child involved in a delinquent act are public records,
 14  2 subject to certain exceptions. The bill in Code section
 14  3 232.149 provides that the records and files of a criminal or
 14  4 juvenile justice agency, an intake officer, or a juvenile court
 14  5 officer concerning a child involved in a delinquent act are
 14  6 confidential. The bill further provides that the records of an
 14  7 intake officer or juvenile court officer containing a dismissal
 14  8 of a complaint or an informal adjustment of a complaint when
 14  9 no petition is filed relating to the complaint, shall not be
 14 10 available to the public, but may be disclosed to the judge and
 14 11 professional court staff, including juvenile court officers;
 14 12 the child's counsel or guardian ad litem; the county attorney
 14 13 and county attorney's assistants;  the superintendent or the
 14 14 superintendent's designee of the school district for the
 14 15 school attended by the child or the authorities in charge of
 14 16 an accredited nonpublic school attended by the child; a member
 14 17 of the armed forces of the United States who is conducting a
 14 18 background investigation of an individual pursuant to federal
 14 19 law; the statistical analysis center for the purposes stated
 14 20 in Code section 216A.136; the state public defender;  the
 14 21 department of human services; and the alleged victim of the
 14 22 delinquent act.
 14 23    PUBLIC RECORDS HEARINGS.  The bill enacts new Code section
 14 24 232.149B, which provides that a person may apply for a court
 14 25 order to make confidential juvenile court records public.
 14 26 The bill provides that a rebuttable presumption exists that
 14 27 official juvenile court records shall remain confidential. The
 14 28 bill provides that the court shall order the official juvenile
 14 29 court records in such a delinquency proceeding to be public
 14 30 records if either the public's interest in making the records
 14 31 public outweighs the juvenile's interest in maintaining the
 14 32 confidentiality of the records or the juvenile has been placed
 14 33 on youthful offender status pursuant to Code section 232.45(7)
 14 34 and Code section 907.3A(1), and will be transferred back to
 14 35 the district court for sentencing prior to the child's 18th
 15  1 birthday. The court may order the official juvenile court
 15  2 records in such a delinquency proceeding to be public records
 15  3 if the juvenile has been subsequently adjudicated delinquent
 15  4 for a public offense that would be a serious misdemeanor,
 15  5 aggravated misdemeanor, or felony offense if committed by an
 15  6 adult, or another delinquency proceeding is pending seeking
 15  7 such an adjudication. The bill provides that records subject
 15  8 to a public records order may be sealed at a later date
 15  9 pursuant to Code section 232.150.
 15 10    RIGHT TO REVIEW AND RELEASE A CONFIDENTIAL COMPLAINT.  The
 15 11 bill provides that delinquency complaints shall be released
 15 12 in accordance with Code section 915.25. Under current Code
 15 13 section 915.25, a complaint which alleges that a child who is
 15 14 at least 10 years of age committed a delinquent act, which if
 15 15 committed by an adult would be a public offense, is a public
 15 16 record. Current Code section 915.25 authorizes the court,
 15 17 its designee, or law enforcement officials to release such
 15 18 a complaint, including the identity of the child. The bill
 15 19 amends Code section 915.25 to provide that such a complaint
 15 20 is confidential unless the complaint alleges that the child
 15 21 committed a delinquent act that if committed by an adult would
 15 22 be a forcible felony. However, the bill authorizes state and
 15 23 local enforcement officials to release a confidential complaint
 15 24 against a child if the child is at large and doing so is deemed
 15 25 necessary for the protection of the public or the safety of
 15 26 the child. If the complaint is not confidential because the
 15 27 alleged delinquent act is an act that would be a forcible
 15 28 felony if committed by an adult, the court, its designee,
 15 29 or law enforcement officials may release such a complaint,
 15 30 including the identity of the child.
 15 31    The bill provides that an intake or juvenile court officer
 15 32 shall disclose to the alleged victim of a delinquent act, upon
 15 33 request, the complaint, the name and address of the child who
 15 34 allegedly committed the delinquent act, and the disposition
 15 35 of the complaint. If the alleged delinquent act would be
 16  1 a forcible felony if committed by an adult, the intake or
 16  2 juvenile court officer shall provide notification to the victim
 16  3 as required by Code section 915.24.
 16  4    SEALING OF JUVENILE COURT RECORDS UNAVAILABLE FOR
 16  5 OPERATING=WHILE=INTOXICATED VIOLATIONS.  Under current Code
 16  6 section 232.150, a court shall order juvenile court records
 16  7 to be sealed if the person who is the subject of the juvenile
 16  8 court records is 18 years of age or older and 2 years have
 16  9 elapsed since the last official action in the person's case,
 16 10 the person has not been subsequently convicted of a felony
 16 11 or an aggravated or serious misdemeanor or adjudicated a
 16 12 delinquent child for an act which if committed by an adult
 16 13 would be a felony, an aggravated misdemeanor, or a serious
 16 14 misdemeanor and no proceeding is pending seeking such
 16 15 conviction or adjudication, and the person was not placed on
 16 16 youthful offender status, transferred back to district court
 16 17 after the youthful offender's 18th birthday, and sentenced for
 16 18 the offense which precipitated the youthful offender placement.
 16 19 The bill in newly designated Code section 232.150(4) provides
 16 20 that the court shall not seal a person's juvenile court records
 16 21 if the person was adjudicated delinquent for violating Code
 16 22 section 321J.2, which prohibits the operation of a motor
 16 23 vehicle while under the influence of alcohol or a drug.
 16 24    RELEASE OF CONFIDENTIAL RECORDS.  The bill provides that a
 16 25 public record which is confidential under the provisions of
 16 26 Code chapter 232 shall only be subject to release upon order of
 16 27 a court in a proceeding under Code chapter 232.
 16 28    EXISTING CONFIDENTIALITY EXEMPTIONS.  The bill retains
 16 29 certain existing exemptions to confidentiality of juvenile
 16 30 court records. Pursuant to Code section 692A.121(8), records
 16 31 concerning sex offense convictions which are committed by
 16 32 minors may be released in the same manner as records of
 16 33 convictions of adults. Pursuant to Code section 915.10A,
 16 34 information concerning a juvenile charged with a felony offense
 16 35 may be released pursuant to an automated victim notification
 17  1 system. Under the bill, these exemptions to confidentiality
 17  2 are not amended and therefore still apply to juvenile court
 17  3 records.
 17  4    RIGHT TO COUNSEL.  The bill in Code section 232.11 provides
 17  5 that a child has the right to be represented by counsel at a
 17  6 hearing on a confidentiality order under Code section 232.149A
 17  7 or a public records order under Code section 232.149B.
 17  8    APPLICABILITY.  The bill applies to juvenile delinquency
 17  9 proceedings which are pending or arise on or after July 1,
 17 10 2016.
       LSB 5193HV (4) 86
       jh/rj
 11  4 confidential and therefore are not public records except in
 11  5 cases alleging the commission of a delinquent act that would be
 11  6 a forcible felony if committed by an adult. Under Code section
 11  7 702.11, a forcible felony is any felonious child endangerment,
 11  8 assault, murder, sexual abuse, kidnapping, robbery, human
 11  9 trafficking, arson in the first degree, or burglary in the
 11 10 first degree. If juvenile records are not confidential, the
 11 11 bill provides that a juvenile court officer may release such
 11 12 records.
 11 13    CONFIDENTIALITY ORDERS.  The bill in Code section 232.149A
 11 14 provides that a court shall order juvenile court records
 11 15 alleging the commission of a delinquent act that would be a
 11 16 forcible felony if committed by an adult to be confidential
 11 17 if the court finds that the case has been dismissed and the
 11 18 person is no longer subject to the jurisdiction of the juvenile
 11 19 court and that the child's interest in making the records
 11 20 confidential outweighs the public's interest in the records
 11 21 remaining public records.
 11 22    ACCESS TO CONFIDENTIAL JUVENILE RECORDS.  The bill and
 11 23 Code section 232.147(3) provide that unless an order sealing
 11 24 confidential juvenile records has been entered, confidential
 11 25 juvenile records may still be inspected, without a court
 11 26 order, by the judge and professional court staff, including
 11 27 juvenile court officers; the child and the child's counsel;
 11 28 the child's parent, guardian or custodian, court appointed
 11 29 special advocate, and guardian ad litem, and the members of
 11 30 the child advocacy board created in Code section 237.16 or a
 11 31 local citizen foster care review board created in accordance
 11 32 with Code section 237.19 who are assigning or reviewing the
 11 33 child's case; the county attorney and the county attorney's
 11 34 assistants; an agency, association, facility, or institution
 11 35 which has custody of the child, or is legally responsible for
 12  1 the care, treatment, or supervision of the child, including
 12  2 the department of human services; a court, court professional
 12  3 staff, and adult probation officers in connection with the
 12  4 preparation of a presentence report concerning a person
 12  5 who prior thereto had been the subject of a juvenile court
 12  6 delinquency proceeding; the child's foster parent or an
 12  7 individual providing preadoptive care to the child; the state
 12  8 public defender; the department of corrections; a judicial
 12  9 district department of correctional services; the board of
 12 10 parole; the superintendent or the superintendent's designee of
 12 11 the school district for the school attended by the child or
 12 12 the authorities in charge of an accredited nonpublic school
 12 13 attended by the child; a member of the armed forces of the
 12 14 United States who is conducting a background investigation of
 12 15 an individual pursuant to federal law; the statistical analysis
 12 16 center for the purposes stated in Code section 216A.136; a
 12 17 state or local law enforcement agency; and the alleged victim
 12 18 of any delinquent act in the proceeding.
 12 19    The bill in newly designated Code section 232.147(3A)
 12 20 provides that juvenile court records containing a petition or
 12 21 complaint alleging the commission of a delinquent act that
 12 22 would be a forcible felony if committed by an adult shall be
 12 23 public records unless subject to a confidentiality order under
 12 24 Code section 232.149A or a sealing order under Code section
 12 25 232.150.  However, the bill provides that such official records
 12 26 shall not be available to the public or any governmental
 12 27 agency through the internet or in an electronic customized
 12 28 data report unless the child has been adjudicated delinquent
 12 29 in the matter.  Nevertheless, the bill provides that official
 12 30 juvenile court records may be disclosed without a court order
 12 31 through the internet or in an electronic customized data
 12 32 report prior to the child being adjudicated delinquent to the
 12 33 judge and professional court staff, including juvenile court
 12 34 officers; the child's counsel or guardian ad litem; the county
 12 35 attorney and the county attorney's assistants; a court, court
 13  1 professional staff, and adult probation officers in connection
 13  2 with the preparation of a presentence report concerning a

 13  4 court proceeding; a state or local law enforcement agency; the
 13  5 state public defender; the statistical analysis center for
 13  6 the purposes stated in Code section 216A.136; the department
 13  7 of human services; the department of corrections; a judicial
 13  8 district department of correctional services; and the board of
 13  9 parole.
 13 10    CONFIDENTIALITY OF TRANSCRIPTS.  The bill in newly
 13 11 designated Code section 232.147(3B) provides that if the court
 13 12 has excluded the public from a hearing pursuant to Code section
 13 13 232.39 or 232.92, the transcript of the proceedings shall not
 13 14 be deemed a public record and inspection and disclosure of
 13 15 the contents of the transcript shall not be permitted except
 13 16 pursuant to a court order or unless otherwise provided in Code
 13 17 chapter 232.
 13 18    USE OF ADJUDICATION OF DELINQUENCY FOR PENALTY ENHANCEMENTS
 13 19 OR EVIDENCE.  The bill in newly designated Code section
 13 20 232.147(13) provides that the confidentiality of a final
 13 21 adjudication of delinquency under Code section 232.147 or
 13 22 pursuant to Code section 232.149A shall not prohibit the state
 13 23 from pleading or proving the adjudication at a subsequent
 13 24 criminal or delinquency proceeding for the purpose of penalty
 13 25 enhancement when a provision of the Code specifically deems the
 13 26 delinquency adjudication to constitute a final conviction.
 13 27    The bill in newly designated Code section 232.147(14)
 13 28 provides that the provisions of the bill shall not be construed
 13 29 to limit or restrict the production, use, or introduction
 13 30 of official juvenile court records in any juvenile or adult
 13 31 criminal proceeding, where such records are relevant and deemed
 13 32 admissible under any other provision of the law.
 13 33    CONFIDENTIALITY OF RECORDS AND FILES OF CRIMINAL OR
 13 34 JUVENILE JUSTICE AGENCIES.  Under current law, records and
 13 35 files of a criminal or juvenile justice agency concerning
 14  1 a child involved in a delinquent act are public records,
 14  2 subject to certain exceptions. The bill in Code section
 14  3 232.149 provides that the records and files of a criminal or
 14  4 juvenile justice agency, an intake officer, or a juvenile court
 14  5 officer concerning a child involved in a delinquent act are
 14  6 confidential. The bill further provides that the records of an
 14  7 intake officer or juvenile court officer containing a dismissal
 14  8 of a complaint or an informal adjustment of a complaint when
 14  9 no petition is filed relating to the complaint, shall not be
 14 10 available to the public, but may be disclosed to the judge and

 14 12 the child's counsel or guardian ad litem; the county attorney
 14 13 and county attorney's assistants;  the superintendent or the

 14 20 in Code section 216A.136; the state public defender;  the
 14 21 department of human services; and the alleged victim of the
 14 22 delinquent act.
 14 23    PUBLIC RECORDS HEARINGS.  The bill enacts new Code section
 14 24 232.149B, which provides that a person may apply for a court
 14 25 order to make confidential juvenile court records public.
 14 26 The bill provides that a rebuttable presumption exists that
 14 27 official juvenile court records shall remain confidential. The
 14 28 bill provides that the court shall order the official juvenile
 14 29 court records in such a delinquency proceeding to be public
 14 30 records if either the public's interest in making the records
 14 31 public outweighs the juvenile's interest in maintaining the
 14 32 confidentiality of the records or the juvenile has been placed
 14 33 on youthful offender status pursuant to Code section 232.45(7)
 14 34 and Code section 907.3A(1), and will be transferred back to
 14 35 the district court for sentencing prior to the child's 18th
 15  1 birthday. The court may order the official juvenile court
 15  2 records in such a delinquency proceeding to be public records
 15  3 if the juvenile has been subsequently adjudicated delinquent
 15  4 for a public offense that would be a serious misdemeanor,
 15  5 aggravated misdemeanor, or felony offense if committed by an
 15  6 adult, or another delinquency proceeding is pending seeking
 15  7 such an adjudication. The bill provides that records subject
 15  8 to a public records order may be sealed at a later date
 15  9 pursuant to Code section 232.150.
 15 10    RIGHT TO REVIEW AND RELEASE A CONFIDENTIAL COMPLAINT.  The
 15 11 bill provides that delinquency complaints shall be released
 15 12 in accordance with Code section 915.25. Under current Code
 15 13 section 915.25, a complaint which alleges that a child who is
 15 14 at least 10 years of age committed a delinquent act, which if
 15 15 committed by an adult would be a public offense, is a public
 15 16 record. Current Code section 915.25 authorizes the court,
 15 17 its designee, or law enforcement officials to release such
 15 18 a complaint, including the identity of the child. The bill
 15 19 amends Code section 915.25 to provide that such a complaint
 15 20 is confidential unless the complaint alleges that the child
 15 21 committed a delinquent act that if committed by an adult would
 15 22 be a forcible felony. However, the bill authorizes state and
 15 23 local enforcement officials to release a confidential complaint
 15 24 against a child if the child is at large and doing so is deemed
 15 25 necessary for the protection of the public or the safety of
 15 26 the child. If the complaint is not confidential because the
 15 27 alleged delinquent act is an act that would be a forcible
 15 28 felony if committed by an adult, the court, its designee,
 15 29 or law enforcement officials may release such a complaint,
 15 30 including the identity of the child.
 15 31    The bill provides that an intake or juvenile court officer
 15 32 shall disclose to the alleged victim of a delinquent act, upon
 15 33 request, the complaint, the name and address of the child who
 15 34 allegedly committed the delinquent act, and the disposition
 15 35 of the complaint. If the alleged delinquent act would be
 16  1 a forcible felony if committed by an adult, the intake or
 16  2 juvenile court officer shall provide notification to the victim
 16  3 as required by Code section 915.24.
 16  4    SEALING OF JUVENILE COURT RECORDS UNAVAILABLE FOR
 16  5 OPERATING=WHILE=INTOXICATED VIOLATIONS.  Under current Code
 16  6 section 232.150, a court shall order juvenile court records
 16  7 to be sealed if the person who is the subject of the juvenile
 16  8 court records is 18 years of age or older and 2 years have
 16  9 elapsed since the last official action in the person's case,
 16 10 the person has not been subsequently convicted of a felony
 16 11 or an aggravated or serious misdemeanor or adjudicated a
 16 12 delinquent child for an act which if committed by an adult
 16 13 would be a felony, an aggravated misdemeanor, or a serious
 16 14 misdemeanor and no proceeding is pending seeking such
 16 15 conviction or adjudication, and the person was not placed on
 16 16 youthful offender status, transferred back to district court
 16 17 after the youthful offender's 18th birthday, and sentenced for
 16 18 the offense which precipitated the youthful offender placement.
 16 19 The bill in newly designated Code section 232.150(4) provides
 16 20 that the court shall not seal a person's juvenile court records
 16 21 if the person was adjudicated delinquent for violating Code
 16 22 section 321J.2, which prohibits the operation of a motor
 16 23 vehicle while under the influence of alcohol or a drug.
 16 24    RELEASE OF CONFIDENTIAL RECORDS.  The bill provides that a
 16 25 public record which is confidential under the provisions of
 16 26 Code chapter 232 shall only be subject to release upon order of
 16 27 a court in a proceeding under Code chapter 232.
 16 28    EXISTING CONFIDENTIALITY EXEMPTIONS.  The bill retains
 16 29 certain existing exemptions to confidentiality of juvenile
 16 30 court records. Pursuant to Code section 692A.121(8), records
 16 31 concerning sex offense convictions which are committed by
 16 32 minors may be released in the same manner as records of
 16 33 convictions of adults. Pursuant to Code section 915.10A,
 16 34 information concerning a juvenile charged with a felony offense
 16 35 may be released pursuant to an automated victim notification
 17  1 system. Under the bill, these exemptions to confidentiality
 17  2 are not amended and therefore still apply to juvenile court
 17  3 records.
 17  4    RIGHT TO COUNSEL.  The bill in Code section 232.11 provides
 17  5 that a child has the right to be represented by counsel at a
 17  6 hearing on a confidentiality order under Code section 232.149A
 17  7 or a public records order under Code section 232.149B.
 17  8    APPLICABILITY.  The bill applies to juvenile delinquency
 17  9 proceedings which are pending or arise on or after July 1,
 17 10 2016.

 11  5 cases alleging the commission of a delinquent act that would be
 11  6 a forcible felony if committed by an adult. Under Code section
 11  7 702.11, a forcible felony is any felonious child endangerment,
 11  8 assault, murder, sexual abuse, kidnapping, robbery, human
 11  9 trafficking, arson in the first degree, or burglary in the
 11 10 first degree. If juvenile records are not confidential, the
 11 11 bill provides that a juvenile court officer may release such
 11 12 records.
 11 13    CONFIDENTIALITY ORDERS.  The bill in Code section 232.149A
 11 14 provides that a court shall order juvenile court records
 11 15 alleging the commission of a delinquent act that would be a
 11 16 forcible felony if committed by an adult to be confidential
 11 17 if the court finds that the case has been dismissed and the
 11 18 person is no longer subject to the jurisdiction of the juvenile
 11 19 court and that the child's interest in making the records
 11 20 confidential outweighs the public's interest in the records
 11 21 remaining public records.
 11 22    ACCESS TO CONFIDENTIAL JUVENILE RECORDS.  The bill and
 11 23 Code section 232.147(3) provide that unless an order sealing
 11 24 confidential juvenile records has been entered, confidential
 11 25 juvenile records may still be inspected, without a court
 11 26 order, by the judge and professional court staff, including
 11 27 juvenile court officers; the child and the child's counsel;
 11 28 the child's parent, guardian or custodian, court appointed
 11 29 special advocate, and guardian ad litem, and the members of
 11 30 the child advocacy board created in Code section 237.16 or a
 11 31 local citizen foster care review board created in accordance
 11 32 with Code section 237.19 who are assigning or reviewing the
 11 33 child's case; the county attorney and the county attorney's
 11 34 assistants; an agency, association, facility, or institution
 11 35 which has custody of the child, or is legally responsible for
 12  1 the care, treatment, or supervision of the child, including
 12  2 the department of human services; a court, court professional
 12  3 staff, and adult probation officers in connection with the
 12  4 preparation of a presentence report concerning a person
 12  5 who prior thereto had been the subject of a juvenile court
 12  6 delinquency proceeding; the child's foster parent or an
 12  7 individual providing preadoptive care to the child; the state
 12  8 public defender; the department of corrections; a judicial
 12  9 district department of correctional services; the board of
 12 10 parole; the superintendent or the superintendent's designee of
 12 11 the school district for the school attended by the child or
 12 12 the authorities in charge of an accredited nonpublic school
 12 13 attended by the child; a member of the armed forces of the
 12 14 United States who is conducting a background investigation of
 12 15 an individual pursuant to federal law; the statistical analysis
 12 16 center for the purposes stated in Code section 216A.136; a
 12 17 state or local law enforcement agency; and the alleged victim
 12 18 of any delinquent act in the proceeding.
 12 19    The bill in newly designated Code section 232.147(3A)
 12 20 provides that juvenile court records containing a petition or
 12 21 complaint alleging the commission of a delinquent act that
 12 22 would be a forcible felony if committed by an adult shall be
 12 23 public records unless subject to a confidentiality order under
 12 24 Code section 232.149A or a sealing order under Code section
 12 25 232.150.  However, the bill provides that such official records
 12 26 shall not be available to the public or any governmental
 12 27 agency through the internet or in an electronic customized
 12 28 data report unless the child has been adjudicated delinquent
 12 29 in the matter.  Nevertheless, the bill provides that official
 12 30 juvenile court records may be disclosed without a court order
 12 31 through the internet or in an electronic customized data
 12 32 report prior to the child being adjudicated delinquent to the
 12 33 judge and professional court staff, including juvenile court
 12 34 officers; the child's counsel or guardian ad litem; the county
 12 35 attorney and the county attorney's assistants; a court, court

 13  5 state public defender; the statistical analysis center for
 13  6 the purposes stated in Code section 216A.136; the department
 13  7 of human services; the department of corrections; a judicial
 13  8 district department of correctional services; and the board of
 13  9 parole.
 13 10    CONFIDENTIALITY OF TRANSCRIPTS.  The bill in newly
 13 11 designated Code section 232.147(3B) provides that if the court
 13 12 has excluded the public from a hearing pursuant to Code section
 13 13 232.39 or 232.92, the transcript of the proceedings shall not
 13 14 be deemed a public record and inspection and disclosure of
 13 15 the contents of the transcript shall not be permitted except
 13 16 pursuant to a court order or unless otherwise provided in Code
 13 17 chapter 232.
 13 18    USE OF ADJUDICATION OF DELINQUENCY FOR PENALTY ENHANCEMENTS
 13 19 OR EVIDENCE.  The bill in newly designated Code section
 13 20 232.147(13) provides that the confidentiality of a final
 13 21 adjudication of delinquency under Code section 232.147 or
 13 22 pursuant to Code section 232.149A shall not prohibit the state
 13 23 from pleading or proving the adjudication at a subsequent
 13 24 criminal or delinquency proceeding for the purpose of penalty
 13 25 enhancement when a provision of the Code specifically deems the
 13 26 delinquency adjudication to constitute a final conviction.
 13 27    The bill in newly designated Code section 232.147(14)
 13 28 provides that the provisions of the bill shall not be construed
 13 29 to limit or restrict the production, use, or introduction
 13 30 of official juvenile court records in any juvenile or adult
 13 31 criminal proceeding, where such records are relevant and deemed
 13 32 admissible under any other provision of the law.
 13 33    CONFIDENTIALITY OF RECORDS AND FILES OF CRIMINAL OR
 13 34 JUVENILE JUSTICE AGENCIES.  Under current law, records and
 13 35 files of a criminal or juvenile justice agency concerning
 14  1 a child involved in a delinquent act are public records,
 14  2 subject to certain exceptions. The bill in Code section
 14  3 232.149 provides that the records and files of a criminal or
 14  4 juvenile justice agency, an intake officer, or a juvenile court
 14  5 officer concerning a child involved in a delinquent act are
 14  6 confidential. The bill further provides that the records of an
 14  7 intake officer or juvenile court officer containing a dismissal
 14  8 of a complaint or an informal adjustment of a complaint when
 14  9 no petition is filed relating to the complaint, shall not be
 14 10 available to the public, but may be disclosed to the judge and
 14 11 professional court staff, including juvenile court officers;
 14 12 the child's counsel or guardian ad litem; the county attorney
 14 13 and county attorney's assistants;  the superintendent or the
 14 14 superintendent's designee of the school district for the
 14 15 school attended by the child or the authorities in charge of
 14 16 an accredited nonpublic school attended by the child; a member
 14 17 of the armed forces of the United States who is conducting a
 14 18 background investigation of an individual pursuant to federal
 14 19 law; the statistical analysis center for the purposes stated
 14 20 in Code section 216A.136; the state public defender;  the
 14 21 department of human services; and the alleged victim of the
 14 22 delinquent act.
 14 23    PUBLIC RECORDS HEARINGS.  The bill enacts new Code section
 14 24 232.149B, which provides that a person may apply for a court
 14 25 order to make confidential juvenile court records public.
 14 26 The bill provides that a rebuttable presumption exists that
 14 27 official juvenile court records shall remain confidential. The
 14 28 bill provides that the court shall order the official juvenile
 14 29 court records in such a delinquency proceeding to be public
 14 30 records if either the public's interest in making the records
 14 31 public outweighs the juvenile's interest in maintaining the
 14 32 confidentiality of the records or the juvenile has been placed
 14 33 on youthful offender status pursuant to Code section 232.45(7)
 14 34 and Code section 907.3A(1), and will be transferred back to
 14 35 the district court for sentencing prior to the child's 18th
 15  1 birthday. The court may order the official juvenile court
 15  2 records in such a delinquency proceeding to be public records
 15  3 if the juvenile has been subsequently adjudicated delinquent
 15  4 for a public offense that would be a serious misdemeanor,
 15  5 aggravated misdemeanor, or felony offense if committed by an
 15  6 adult, or another delinquency proceeding is pending seeking
 15  7 such an adjudication. The bill provides that records subject
 15  8 to a public records order may be sealed at a later date
 15  9 pursuant to Code section 232.150.
 15 10    RIGHT TO REVIEW AND RELEASE A CONFIDENTIAL COMPLAINT.  The
 15 11 bill provides that delinquency complaints shall be released
 15 12 in accordance with Code section 915.25. Under current Code
 15 13 section 915.25, a complaint which alleges that a child who is
 15 14 at least 10 years of age committed a delinquent act, which if
 15 15 committed by an adult would be a public offense, is a public
 15 16 record. Current Code section 915.25 authorizes the court,
 15 17 its designee, or law enforcement officials to release such
 15 18 a complaint, including the identity of the child. The bill
 15 19 amends Code section 915.25 to provide that such a complaint
 15 20 is confidential unless the complaint alleges that the child
 15 21 committed a delinquent act that if committed by an adult would
 15 22 be a forcible felony. However, the bill authorizes state and
 15 23 local enforcement officials to release a confidential complaint
 15 24 against a child if the child is at large and doing so is deemed
 15 25 necessary for the protection of the public or the safety of
 15 26 the child. If the complaint is not confidential because the
 15 27 alleged delinquent act is an act that would be a forcible
 15 28 felony if committed by an adult, the court, its designee,
 15 29 or law enforcement officials may release such a complaint,
 15 30 including the identity of the child.
 15 31    The bill provides that an intake or juvenile court officer
 15 32 shall disclose to the alleged victim of a delinquent act, upon
 15 33 request, the complaint, the name and address of the child who
 15 34 allegedly committed the delinquent act, and the disposition
 15 35 of the complaint. If the alleged delinquent act would be
 16  1 a forcible felony if committed by an adult, the intake or
 16  2 juvenile court officer shall provide notification to the victim
 16  3 as required by Code section 915.24.
 16  4    SEALING OF JUVENILE COURT RECORDS UNAVAILABLE FOR
 16  5 OPERATING=WHILE=INTOXICATED VIOLATIONS.  Under current Code
 16  6 section 232.150, a court shall order juvenile court records
 16  7 to be sealed if the person who is the subject of the juvenile
 16  8 court records is 18 years of age or older and 2 years have
 16  9 elapsed since the last official action in the person's case,
 16 10 the person has not been subsequently convicted of a felony
 16 11 or an aggravated or serious misdemeanor or adjudicated a
 16 12 delinquent child for an act which if committed by an adult
 16 13 would be a felony, an aggravated misdemeanor, or a serious
 16 14 misdemeanor and no proceeding is pending seeking such
 16 15 conviction or adjudication, and the person was not placed on
 16 16 youthful offender status, transferred back to district court
 16 17 after the youthful offender's 18th birthday, and sentenced for
 16 18 the offense which precipitated the youthful offender placement.
 16 19 The bill in newly designated Code section 232.150(4) provides
 16 20 that the court shall not seal a person's juvenile court records
 16 21 if the person was adjudicated delinquent for violating Code
 16 22 section 321J.2, which prohibits the operation of a motor
 16 23 vehicle while under the influence of alcohol or a drug.
 16 24    RELEASE OF CONFIDENTIAL RECORDS.  The bill provides that a
 16 25 public record which is confidential under the provisions of
 16 26 Code chapter 232 shall only be subject to release upon order of
 16 27 a court in a proceeding under Code chapter 232.
 16 28    EXISTING CONFIDENTIALITY EXEMPTIONS.  The bill retains
 16 29 certain existing exemptions to confidentiality of juvenile
 16 30 court records. Pursuant to Code section 692A.121(8), records
 16 31 concerning sex offense convictions which are committed by
 16 32 minors may be released in the same manner as records of
 16 33 convictions of adults. Pursuant to Code section 915.10A,
 16 34 information concerning a juvenile charged with a felony offense
 16 35 may be released pursuant to an automated victim notification
 17  1 system. Under the bill, these exemptions to confidentiality
 17  2 are not amended and therefore still apply to juvenile court
 17  3 records.
 17  4    RIGHT TO COUNSEL.  The bill in Code section 232.11 provides
 17  5 that a child has the right to be represented by counsel at a
 17  6 hearing on a confidentiality order under Code section 232.149A
 17  7 or a public records order under Code section 232.149B.
 17  8    APPLICABILITY.  The bill applies to juvenile delinquency
 17  9 proceedings which are pending or arise on or after July 1,
 17 10 2016.

 11  6 a forcible felony if committed by an adult. Under Code section
 11  7 702.11, a forcible felony is any felonious child endangerment,
 11  8 assault, murder, sexual abuse, kidnapping, robbery, human
 11  9 trafficking, arson in the first degree, or burglary in the
 11 10 first degree. If juvenile records are not confidential, the
 11 11 bill provides that a juvenile court officer may release such
 11 12 records.
 11 13    CONFIDENTIALITY ORDERS.  The bill in Code section 232.149A
 11 14 provides that a court shall order juvenile court records
 11 15 alleging the commission of a delinquent act that would be a
 11 16 forcible felony if committed by an adult to be confidential
 11 17 if the court finds that the case has been dismissed and the
 11 18 person is no longer subject to the jurisdiction of the juvenile
 11 19 court and that the child's interest in making the records
 11 20 confidential outweighs the public's interest in the records
 11 21 remaining public records.
 11 22    ACCESS TO CONFIDENTIAL JUVENILE RECORDS.  The bill and
 11 23 Code section 232.147(3) provide that unless an order sealing
 11 24 confidential juvenile records has been entered, confidential
 11 25 juvenile records may still be inspected, without a court
 11 26 order, by the judge and professional court staff, including
 11 27 juvenile court officers; the child and the child's counsel;
 11 28 the child's parent, guardian or custodian, court appointed
 11 29 special advocate, and guardian ad litem, and the members of
 11 30 the child advocacy board created in Code section 237.16 or a
 11 31 local citizen foster care review board created in accordance
 11 32 with Code section 237.19 who are assigning or reviewing the
 11 33 child's case; the county attorney and the county attorney's
 11 34 assistants; an agency, association, facility, or institution
 11 35 which has custody of the child, or is legally responsible for
 12  1 the care, treatment, or supervision of the child, including
 12  2 the department of human services; a court, court professional
 12  3 staff, and adult probation officers in connection with the
 12  4 preparation of a presentence report concerning a person
 12  5 who prior thereto had been the subject of a juvenile court
 12  6 delinquency proceeding; the child's foster parent or an
 12  7 individual providing preadoptive care to the child; the state
 12  8 public defender; the department of corrections; a judicial
 12  9 district department of correctional services; the board of
 12 10 parole; the superintendent or the superintendent's designee of
 12 11 the school district for the school attended by the child or
 12 12 the authorities in charge of an accredited nonpublic school
 12 13 attended by the child; a member of the armed forces of the
 12 14 United States who is conducting a background investigation of
 12 15 an individual pursuant to federal law; the statistical analysis
 12 16 center for the purposes stated in Code section 216A.136; a
 12 17 state or local law enforcement agency; and the alleged victim
 12 18 of any delinquent act in the proceeding.
 12 19    The bill in newly designated Code section 232.147(3A)
 12 20 provides that juvenile court records containing a petition or
 12 21 complaint alleging the commission of a delinquent act that
 12 22 would be a forcible felony if committed by an adult shall be
 12 23 public records unless subject to a confidentiality order under
 12 24 Code section 232.149A or a sealing order under Code section
 12 25 232.150.  However, the bill provides that such official records
 12 26 shall not be available to the public or any governmental
 12 27 agency through the internet or in an electronic customized
 12 28 data report unless the child has been adjudicated delinquent
 12 29 in the matter.  Nevertheless, the bill provides that official
 12 30 juvenile court records may be disclosed without a court order
 12 31 through the internet or in an electronic customized data
 12 32 report prior to the child being adjudicated delinquent to the
 12 33 judge and professional court staff, including juvenile court
 12 34 officers; the child's counsel or guardian ad litem; the county
 12 35 attorney and the county attorney's assistants; a court, court
 13  1 professional staff, and adult probation officers in connection
 13  2 with the preparation of a presentence report concerning a
 13  3 person who prior thereto had been the subject of a juvenile
 13  4 court proceeding; a state or local law enforcement agency; the
 13  5 state public defender; the statistical analysis center for
 13  6 the purposes stated in Code section 216A.136; the department
 13  7 of human services; the department of corrections; a judicial
 13  8 district department of correctional services; and the board of
 13  9 parole.
 13 10    CONFIDENTIALITY OF TRANSCRIPTS.  The bill in newly
 13 11 designated Code section 232.147(3B) provides that if the court
 13 12 has excluded the public from a hearing pursuant to Code section
 13 13 232.39 or 232.92, the transcript of the proceedings shall not
 13 14 be deemed a public record and inspection and disclosure of
 13 15 the contents of the transcript shall not be permitted except
 13 16 pursuant to a court order or unless otherwise provided in Code
 13 17 chapter 232.
 13 18    USE OF ADJUDICATION OF DELINQUENCY FOR PENALTY ENHANCEMENTS
 13 19 OR EVIDENCE.  The bill in newly designated Code section
 13 20 232.147(13) provides that the confidentiality of a final
 13 21 adjudication of delinquency under Code section 232.147 or
 13 22 pursuant to Code section 232.149A shall not prohibit the state
 13 23 from pleading or proving the adjudication at a subsequent
 13 24 criminal or delinquency proceeding for the purpose of penalty
 13 25 enhancement when a provision of the Code specifically deems the
 13 26 delinquency adjudication to constitute a final conviction.
 13 27    The bill in newly designated Code section 232.147(14)
 13 28 provides that the provisions of the bill shall not be construed
 13 29 to limit or restrict the production, use, or introduction
 13 30 of official juvenile court records in any juvenile or adult
 13 31 criminal proceeding, where such records are relevant and deemed
 13 32 admissible under any other provision of the law.
 13 33    CONFIDENTIALITY OF RECORDS AND FILES OF CRIMINAL OR
 13 34 JUVENILE JUSTICE AGENCIES.  Under current law, records and
 13 35 files of a criminal or juvenile justice agency concerning
 14  1 a child involved in a delinquent act are public records,
 14  2 subject to certain exceptions. The bill in Code section
 14  3 232.149 provides that the records and files of a criminal or
 14  4 juvenile justice agency, an intake officer, or a juvenile court
 14  5 officer concerning a child involved in a delinquent act are
 14  6 confidential. The bill further provides that the records of an
 14  7 intake officer or juvenile court officer containing a dismissal
 14  8 of a complaint or an informal adjustment of a complaint when
 14  9 no petition is filed relating to the complaint, shall not be
 14 10 available to the public, but may be disclosed to the judge and
 14 11 professional court staff, including juvenile court officers;
 14 12 the child's counsel or guardian ad litem; the county attorney
 14 13 and county attorney's assistants;  the superintendent or the
 14 14 superintendent's designee of the school district for the
 14 15 school attended by the child or the authorities in charge of
 14 16 an accredited nonpublic school attended by the child; a member
 14 17 of the armed forces of the United States who is conducting a
 14 18 background investigation of an individual pursuant to federal
 14 19 law; the statistical analysis center for the purposes stated
 14 20 in Code section 216A.136; the state public defender;  the
 14 21 department of human services; and the alleged victim of the
 14 22 delinquent act.
 14 23    PUBLIC RECORDS HEARINGS.  The bill enacts new Code section
 14 24 232.149B, which provides that a person may apply for a court
 14 25 order to make confidential juvenile court records public.
 14 26 The bill provides that a rebuttable presumption exists that
 14 27 official juvenile court records shall remain confidential. The
 14 28 bill provides that the court shall order the official juvenile
 14 29 court records in such a delinquency proceeding to be public
 14 30 records if either the public's interest in making the records
 14 31 public outweighs the juvenile's interest in maintaining the
 14 32 confidentiality of the records or the juvenile has been placed
 14 33 on youthful offender status pursuant to Code section 232.45(7)
 14 34 and Code section 907.3A(1), and will be transferred back to
 14 35 the district court for sentencing prior to the child's 18th
 15  1 birthday. The court may order the official juvenile court
 15  2 records in such a delinquency proceeding to be public records
 15  3 if the juvenile has been subsequently adjudicated delinquent
 15  4 for a public offense that would be a serious misdemeanor,
 15  5 aggravated misdemeanor, or felony offense if committed by an
 15  6 adult, or another delinquency proceeding is pending seeking
 15  7 such an adjudication. The bill provides that records subject
 15  8 to a public records order may be sealed at a later date
 15  9 pursuant to Code section 232.150.
 15 10    RIGHT TO REVIEW AND RELEASE A CONFIDENTIAL COMPLAINT.  The
 15 11 bill provides that delinquency complaints shall be released
 15 12 in accordance with Code section 915.25. Under current Code
 15 13 section 915.25, a complaint which alleges that a child who is
 15 14 at least 10 years of age committed a delinquent act, which if
 15 15 committed by an adult would be a public offense, is a public
 15 16 record. Current Code section 915.25 authorizes the court,
 15 17 its designee, or law enforcement officials to release such
 15 18 a complaint, including the identity of the child. The bill
 15 19 amends Code section 915.25 to provide that such a complaint
 15 20 is confidential unless the complaint alleges that the child
 15 21 committed a delinquent act that if committed by an adult would
 15 22 be a forcible felony. However, the bill authorizes state and
 15 23 local enforcement officials to release a confidential complaint
 15 24 against a child if the child is at large and doing so is deemed
 15 25 necessary for the protection of the public or the safety of
 15 26 the child. If the complaint is not confidential because the
 15 27 alleged delinquent act is an act that would be a forcible
 15 28 felony if committed by an adult, the court, its designee,
 15 29 or law enforcement officials may release such a complaint,
 15 30 including the identity of the child.
 15 31    The bill provides that an intake or juvenile court officer
 15 32 shall disclose to the alleged victim of a delinquent act, upon
 15 33 request, the complaint, the name and address of the child who
 15 34 allegedly committed the delinquent act, and the disposition
 15 35 of the complaint. If the alleged delinquent act would be
 16  1 a forcible felony if committed by an adult, the intake or
 16  2 juvenile court officer shall provide notification to the victim
 16  3 as required by Code section 915.24.
 16  4    SEALING OF JUVENILE COURT RECORDS UNAVAILABLE FOR
 16  5 OPERATING=WHILE=INTOXICATED VIOLATIONS.  Under current Code
 16  6 section 232.150, a court shall order juvenile court records
 16  7 to be sealed if the person who is the subject of the juvenile
 16  8 court records is 18 years of age or older and 2 years have
 16  9 elapsed since the last official action in the person's case,
 16 10 the person has not been subsequently convicted of a felony
 16 11 or an aggravated or serious misdemeanor or adjudicated a
 16 12 delinquent child for an act which if committed by an adult
 16 13 would be a felony, an aggravated misdemeanor, or a serious
 16 14 misdemeanor and no proceeding is pending seeking such
 16 15 conviction or adjudication, and the person was not placed on
 16 16 youthful offender status, transferred back to district court
 16 17 after the youthful offender's 18th birthday, and sentenced for
 16 18 the offense which precipitated the youthful offender placement.
 16 19 The bill in newly designated Code section 232.150(4) provides
 16 20 that the court shall not seal a person's juvenile court records
 16 21 if the person was adjudicated delinquent for violating Code
 16 22 section 321J.2, which prohibits the operation of a motor
 16 23 vehicle while under the influence of alcohol or a drug.
 16 24    RELEASE OF CONFIDENTIAL RECORDS.  The bill provides that a
 16 25 public record which is confidential under the provisions of
 16 26 Code chapter 232 shall only be subject to release upon order of
 16 27 a court in a proceeding under Code chapter 232.
 16 28    EXISTING CONFIDENTIALITY EXEMPTIONS.  The bill retains
 16 29 certain existing exemptions to confidentiality of juvenile
 16 30 court records. Pursuant to Code section 692A.121(8), records
 16 31 concerning sex offense convictions which are committed by
 16 32 minors may be released in the same manner as records of
 16 33 convictions of adults. Pursuant to Code section 915.10A,
 16 34 information concerning a juvenile charged with a felony offense
 16 35 may be released pursuant to an automated victim notification
 17  1 system. Under the bill, these exemptions to confidentiality
 17  2 are not amended and therefore still apply to juvenile court
 17  3 records.
 17  4    RIGHT TO COUNSEL.  The bill in Code section 232.11 provides
 17  5 that a child has the right to be represented by counsel at a
 17  6 hearing on a confidentiality order under Code section 232.149A
 17  7 or a public records order under Code section 232.149B.
 17  8    APPLICABILITY.  The bill applies to juvenile delinquency
 17  9 proceedings which are pending or arise on or after July 1,
 17 10 2016.

 11  7 702.11, a forcible felony is any felonious child endangerment,
 11  8 assault, murder, sexual abuse, kidnapping, robbery, human
 11  9 trafficking, arson in the first degree, or burglary in the
 11 10 first degree. If juvenile records are not confidential, the
 11 11 bill provides that a juvenile court officer may release such
 11 12 records.
 11 13    CONFIDENTIALITY ORDERS.  The bill in Code section 232.149A
 11 14 provides that a court shall order juvenile court records
 11 15 alleging the commission of a delinquent act that would be a
 11 16 forcible felony if committed by an adult to be confidential
 11 17 if the court finds that the case has been dismissed and the
 11 18 person is no longer subject to the jurisdiction of the juvenile
 11 19 court and that the child's interest in making the records
 11 20 confidential outweighs the public's interest in the records
 11 21 remaining public records.
 11 22    ACCESS TO CONFIDENTIAL JUVENILE RECORDS.  The bill and
 11 23 Code section 232.147(3) provide that unless an order sealing
 11 24 confidential juvenile records has been entered, confidential
 11 25 juvenile records may still be inspected, without a court
 11 26 order, by the judge and professional court staff, including
 11 27 juvenile court officers; the child and the child's counsel;
 11 28 the child's parent, guardian or custodian, court appointed
 11 29 special advocate, and guardian ad litem, and the members of
 11 30 the child advocacy board created in Code section 237.16 or a
 11 31 local citizen foster care review board created in accordance
 11 32 with Code section 237.19 who are assigning or reviewing the
 11 33 child's case; the county attorney and the county attorney's
 11 34 assistants; an agency, association, facility, or institution
 11 35 which has custody of the child, or is legally responsible for
 12  1 the care, treatment, or supervision of the child, including
 12  2 the department of human services; a court, court professional
 12  3 staff, and adult probation officers in connection with the
 12  4 preparation of a presentence report concerning a person
 12  5 who prior thereto had been the subject of a juvenile court
 12  6 delinquency proceeding; the child's foster parent or an
 12  7 individual providing preadoptive care to the child; the state
 12  8 public defender; the department of corrections; a judicial
 12  9 district department of correctional services; the board of
 12 10 parole; the superintendent or the superintendent's designee of
 12 11 the school district for the school attended by the child or
 12 12 the authorities in charge of an accredited nonpublic school
 12 13 attended by the child; a member of the armed forces of the
 12 14 United States who is conducting a background investigation of
 12 15 an individual pursuant to federal law; the statistical analysis
 12 16 center for the purposes stated in Code section 216A.136; a
 12 17 state or local law enforcement agency; and the alleged victim
 12 18 of any delinquent act in the proceeding.
 12 19    The bill in newly designated Code section 232.147(3A)
 12 20 provides that juvenile court records containing a petition or
 12 21 complaint alleging the commission of a delinquent act that
 12 22 would be a forcible felony if committed by an adult shall be
 12 23 public records unless subject to a confidentiality order under
 12 24 Code section 232.149A or a sealing order under Code section
 12 25 232.150.  However, the bill provides that such official records
 12 26 shall not be available to the public or any governmental
 12 27 agency through the internet or in an electronic customized
 12 28 data report unless the child has been adjudicated delinquent
 12 29 in the matter.  Nevertheless, the bill provides that official
 12 30 juvenile court records may be disclosed without a court order
 12 31 through the internet or in an electronic customized data
 12 32 report prior to the child being adjudicated delinquent to the
 12 33 judge and professional court staff, including juvenile court
 12 34 officers; the child's counsel or guardian ad litem; the county
 12 35 attorney and the county attorney's assistants; a court, court
 13  1 professional staff, and adult probation officers in connection
 13  2 with the preparation of a presentence report concerning a
 13  3 person who prior thereto had been the subject of a juvenile
 13  4 court proceeding; a state or local law enforcement agency; the
 13  5 state public defender; the statistical analysis center for

 13  7 of human services; the department of corrections; a judicial
 13  8 district department of correctional services; and the board of
 13  9 parole.
 13 10    CONFIDENTIALITY OF TRANSCRIPTS.  The bill in newly
 13 11 designated Code section 232.147(3B) provides that if the court
 13 12 has excluded the public from a hearing pursuant to Code section
 13 13 232.39 or 232.92, the transcript of the proceedings shall not
 13 14 be deemed a public record and inspection and disclosure of
 13 15 the contents of the transcript shall not be permitted except
 13 16 pursuant to a court order or unless otherwise provided in Code
 13 17 chapter 232.
 13 18    USE OF ADJUDICATION OF DELINQUENCY FOR PENALTY ENHANCEMENTS
 13 19 OR EVIDENCE.  The bill in newly designated Code section
 13 20 232.147(13) provides that the confidentiality of a final
 13 21 adjudication of delinquency under Code section 232.147 or
 13 22 pursuant to Code section 232.149A shall not prohibit the state
 13 23 from pleading or proving the adjudication at a subsequent
 13 24 criminal or delinquency proceeding for the purpose of penalty
 13 25 enhancement when a provision of the Code specifically deems the
 13 26 delinquency adjudication to constitute a final conviction.
 13 27    The bill in newly designated Code section 232.147(14)
 13 28 provides that the provisions of the bill shall not be construed
 13 29 to limit or restrict the production, use, or introduction
 13 30 of official juvenile court records in any juvenile or adult
 13 31 criminal proceeding, where such records are relevant and deemed
 13 32 admissible under any other provision of the law.
 13 33    CONFIDENTIALITY OF RECORDS AND FILES OF CRIMINAL OR
 13 34 JUVENILE JUSTICE AGENCIES.  Under current law, records and
 13 35 files of a criminal or juvenile justice agency concerning
 14  1 a child involved in a delinquent act are public records,
 14  2 subject to certain exceptions. The bill in Code section
 14  3 232.149 provides that the records and files of a criminal or
 14  4 juvenile justice agency, an intake officer, or a juvenile court
 14  5 officer concerning a child involved in a delinquent act are
 14  6 confidential. The bill further provides that the records of an
 14  7 intake officer or juvenile court officer containing a dismissal
 14  8 of a complaint or an informal adjustment of a complaint when
 14  9 no petition is filed relating to the complaint, shall not be
 14 10 available to the public, but may be disclosed to the judge and
 14 11 professional court staff, including juvenile court officers;
 14 12 the child's counsel or guardian ad litem; the county attorney
 14 13 and county attorney's assistants;  the superintendent or the
 14 14 superintendent's designee of the school district for the
 14 15 school attended by the child or the authorities in charge of
 14 16 an accredited nonpublic school attended by the child; a member
 14 17 of the armed forces of the United States who is conducting a
 14 18 background investigation of an individual pursuant to federal
 14 19 law; the statistical analysis center for the purposes stated
 14 20 in Code section 216A.136; the state public defender;  the
 14 21 department of human services; and the alleged victim of the
 14 22 delinquent act.
 14 23    PUBLIC RECORDS HEARINGS.  The bill enacts new Code section
 14 24 232.149B, which provides that a person may apply for a court
 14 25 order to make confidential juvenile court records public.
 14 26 The bill provides that a rebuttable presumption exists that
 14 27 official juvenile court records shall remain confidential. The
 14 28 bill provides that the court shall order the official juvenile
 14 29 court records in such a delinquency proceeding to be public
 14 30 records if either the public's interest in making the records
 14 31 public outweighs the juvenile's interest in maintaining the
 14 32 confidentiality of the records or the juvenile has been placed
 14 33 on youthful offender status pursuant to Code section 232.45(7)
 14 34 and Code section 907.3A(1), and will be transferred back to
 14 35 the district court for sentencing prior to the child's 18th
 15  1 birthday. The court may order the official juvenile court
 15  2 records in such a delinquency proceeding to be public records
 15  3 if the juvenile has been subsequently adjudicated delinquent
 15  4 for a public offense that would be a serious misdemeanor,
 15  5 aggravated misdemeanor, or felony offense if committed by an
 15  6 adult, or another delinquency proceeding is pending seeking
 15  7 such an adjudication. The bill provides that records subject
 15  8 to a public records order may be sealed at a later date
 15  9 pursuant to Code section 232.150.
 15 10    RIGHT TO REVIEW AND RELEASE A CONFIDENTIAL COMPLAINT.  The
 15 11 bill provides that delinquency complaints shall be released
 15 12 in accordance with Code section 915.25. Under current Code
 15 13 section 915.25, a complaint which alleges that a child who is
 15 14 at least 10 years of age committed a delinquent act, which if
 15 15 committed by an adult would be a public offense, is a public
 15 16 record. Current Code section 915.25 authorizes the court,
 15 17 its designee, or law enforcement officials to release such
 15 18 a complaint, including the identity of the child. The bill
 15 19 amends Code section 915.25 to provide that such a complaint
 15 20 is confidential unless the complaint alleges that the child
 15 21 committed a delinquent act that if committed by an adult would
 15 22 be a forcible felony. However, the bill authorizes state and
 15 23 local enforcement officials to release a confidential complaint
 15 24 against a child if the child is at large and doing so is deemed
 15 25 necessary for the protection of the public or the safety of
 15 26 the child. If the complaint is not confidential because the
 15 27 alleged delinquent act is an act that would be a forcible
 15 28 felony if committed by an adult, the court, its designee,
 15 29 or law enforcement officials may release such a complaint,
 15 30 including the identity of the child.
 15 31    The bill provides that an intake or juvenile court officer
 15 32 shall disclose to the alleged victim of a delinquent act, upon
 15 33 request, the complaint, the name and address of the child who
 15 34 allegedly committed the delinquent act, and the disposition
 15 35 of the complaint. If the alleged delinquent act would be
 16  1 a forcible felony if committed by an adult, the intake or
 16  2 juvenile court officer shall provide notification to the victim
 16  3 as required by Code section 915.24.
 16  4    SEALING OF JUVENILE COURT RECORDS UNAVAILABLE FOR
 16  5 OPERATING=WHILE=INTOXICATED VIOLATIONS.  Under current Code
 16  6 section 232.150, a court shall order juvenile court records
 16  7 to be sealed if the person who is the subject of the juvenile
 16  8 court records is 18 years of age or older and 2 years have
 16  9 elapsed since the last official action in the person's case,
 16 10 the person has not been subsequently convicted of a felony
 16 11 or an aggravated or serious misdemeanor or adjudicated a
 16 12 delinquent child for an act which if committed by an adult
 16 13 would be a felony, an aggravated misdemeanor, or a serious
 16 14 misdemeanor and no proceeding is pending seeking such
 16 15 conviction or adjudication, and the person was not placed on
 16 16 youthful offender status, transferred back to district court
 16 17 after the youthful offender's 18th birthday, and sentenced for
 16 18 the offense which precipitated the youthful offender placement.
 16 19 The bill in newly designated Code section 232.150(4) provides
 16 20 that the court shall not seal a person's juvenile court records
 16 21 if the person was adjudicated delinquent for violating Code
 16 22 section 321J.2, which prohibits the operation of a motor
 16 23 vehicle while under the influence of alcohol or a drug.
 16 24    RELEASE OF CONFIDENTIAL RECORDS.  The bill provides that a
 16 25 public record which is confidential under the provisions of
 16 26 Code chapter 232 shall only be subject to release upon order of
 16 27 a court in a proceeding under Code chapter 232.
 16 28    EXISTING CONFIDENTIALITY EXEMPTIONS.  The bill retains
 16 29 certain existing exemptions to confidentiality of juvenile
 16 30 court records. Pursuant to Code section 692A.121(8), records
 16 31 concerning sex offense convictions which are committed by
 16 32 minors may be released in the same manner as records of
 16 33 convictions of adults. Pursuant to Code section 915.10A,
 16 34 information concerning a juvenile charged with a felony offense
 16 35 may be released pursuant to an automated victim notification
 17  1 system. Under the bill, these exemptions to confidentiality
 17  2 are not amended and therefore still apply to juvenile court
 17  3 records.
 17  4    RIGHT TO COUNSEL.  The bill in Code section 232.11 provides
 17  5 that a child has the right to be represented by counsel at a
 17  6 hearing on a confidentiality order under Code section 232.149A
 17  7 or a public records order under Code section 232.149B.
 17  8    APPLICABILITY.  The bill applies to juvenile delinquency

 11 11 bill provides that a juvenile court officer may release such
 11 12 records.
 11 13    CONFIDENTIALITY ORDERS.  The bill in Code section 232.149A
 11 14 provides that a court shall order juvenile court records
 11 15 alleging the commission of a delinquent act that would be a
 11 16 forcible felony if committed by an adult to be confidential
 11 17 if the court finds that the case has been dismissed and the

 11 19 court and that the child's interest in making the records
 11 20 confidential outweighs the public's interest in the records
 11 21 remaining public records.
 11 22    ACCESS TO CONFIDENTIAL JUVENILE RECORDS.  The bill and
 11 23 Code section 232.147(3) provide that unless an order sealing
 11 24 confidential juvenile records has been entered, confidential
 11 25 juvenile records may still be inspected, without a court
 11 26 order, by the judge and professional court staff, including

 11 30 the child advocacy board created in Code section 237.16 or a
 11 31 local citizen foster care review board created in accordance
 11 32 with Code section 237.19 who are assigning or reviewing the
 11 33 child's case; the county attorney and the county attorney's
 11 34 assistants; an agency, association, facility, or institution
 11 35 which has custody of the child, or is legally responsible for
 12  1 the care, treatment, or supervision of the child, including
 12  2 the department of human services; a court, court professional

 12  4 preparation of a presentence report concerning a person
 12  5 who prior thereto had been the subject of a juvenile court
 12  6 delinquency proceeding; the child's foster parent or an
 12  7 individual providing preadoptive care to the child; the state
 12  8 public defender; the department of corrections; a judicial
 12  9 district department of correctional services; the board of
 12 10 parole; the superintendent or the superintendent's designee of

 12 16 center for the purposes stated in Code section 216A.136; a
 12 17 state or local law enforcement agency; and the alleged victim
 12 18 of any delinquent act in the proceeding.
 12 19    The bill in newly designated Code section 232.147(3A)
 12 20 provides that juvenile court records containing a petition or
 12 21 complaint alleging the commission of a delinquent act that
 12 22 would be a forcible felony if committed by an adult shall be
 12 23 public records unless subject to a confidentiality order under
 12 24 Code section 232.149A or a sealing order under Code section
 12 25 232.150.  However, the bill provides that such official records
 12 26 shall not be available to the public or any governmental
 12 27 agency through the internet or in an electronic customized
 12 28 data report unless the child has been adjudicated delinquent
 12 29 in the matter.  Nevertheless, the bill provides that official
 12 30 juvenile court records may be disclosed without a court order
 12 31 through the internet or in an electronic customized data
 12 32 report prior to the child being adjudicated delinquent to the
 12 33 judge and professional court staff, including juvenile court
 12 34 officers; the child's counsel or guardian ad litem; the county
 12 35 attorney and the county attorney's assistants; a court, court
 13  1 professional staff, and adult probation officers in connection

 13 10    CONFIDENTIALITY OF TRANSCRIPTS.  The bill in newly
 13 11 designated Code section 232.147(3B) provides that if the court
 13 12 has excluded the public from a hearing pursuant to Code section
 13 13 232.39 or 232.92, the transcript of the proceedings shall not
 13 14 be deemed a public record and inspection and disclosure of
 13 15 the contents of the transcript shall not be permitted except
 13 16 pursuant to a court order or unless otherwise provided in Code
 13 17 chapter 232.
 13 18    USE OF ADJUDICATION OF DELINQUENCY FOR PENALTY ENHANCEMENTS
 13 19 OR EVIDENCE.  The bill in newly designated Code section
 13 20 232.147(13) provides that the confidentiality of a final
 13 21 adjudication of delinquency under Code section 232.147 or
 13 22 pursuant to Code section 232.149A shall not prohibit the state
 13 23 from pleading or proving the adjudication at a subsequent
 13 24 criminal or delinquency proceeding for the purpose of penalty
 13 25 enhancement when a provision of the Code specifically deems the
 13 26 delinquency adjudication to constitute a final conviction.
 13 27    The bill in newly designated Code section 232.147(14)
 13 28 provides that the provisions of the bill shall not be construed

 13 32 admissible under any other provision of the law.
 13 33    CONFIDENTIALITY OF RECORDS AND FILES OF CRIMINAL OR
 13 34 JUVENILE JUSTICE AGENCIES.  Under current law, records and
 13 35 files of a criminal or juvenile justice agency concerning
 14  1 a child involved in a delinquent act are public records,
 14  2 subject to certain exceptions. The bill in Code section
 14  3 232.149 provides that the records and files of a criminal or
 14  4 juvenile justice agency, an intake officer, or a juvenile court
 14  5 officer concerning a child involved in a delinquent act are
 14  6 confidential. The bill further provides that the records of an
 14  7 intake officer or juvenile court officer containing a dismissal
 14  8 of a complaint or an informal adjustment of a complaint when
 14  9 no petition is filed relating to the complaint, shall not be
 14 10 available to the public, but may be disclosed to the judge and

 14 21 department of human services; and the alleged victim of the
 14 22 delinquent act.
 14 23    PUBLIC RECORDS HEARINGS.  The bill enacts new Code section
 14 24 232.149B, which provides that a person may apply for a court
 14 25 order to make confidential juvenile court records public.
 14 26 The bill provides that a rebuttable presumption exists that
 14 27 official juvenile court records shall remain confidential. The
 14 28 bill provides that the court shall order the official juvenile
 14 29 court records in such a delinquency proceeding to be public
 14 30 records if either the public's interest in making the records
 14 31 public outweighs the juvenile's interest in maintaining the
 14 32 confidentiality of the records or the juvenile has been placed
 14 33 on youthful offender status pursuant to Code section 232.45(7)
 14 34 and Code section 907.3A(1), and will be transferred back to
 14 35 the district court for sentencing prior to the child's 18th

 15  3 if the juvenile has been subsequently adjudicated delinquent
 15  4 for a public offense that would be a serious misdemeanor,
 15  5 aggravated misdemeanor, or felony offense if committed by an
 15  6 adult, or another delinquency proceeding is pending seeking
 15  7 such an adjudication. The bill provides that records subject
 15  8 to a public records order may be sealed at a later date
 15  9 pursuant to Code section 232.150.
 15 10    RIGHT TO REVIEW AND RELEASE A CONFIDENTIAL COMPLAINT.  The
 15 11 bill provides that delinquency complaints shall be released
 15 12 in accordance with Code section 915.25. Under current Code
 15 13 section 915.25, a complaint which alleges that a child who is
 15 14 at least 10 years of age committed a delinquent act, which if
 15 15 committed by an adult would be a public offense, is a public
 15 16 record. Current Code section 915.25 authorizes the court,
 15 17 its designee, or law enforcement officials to release such
 15 18 a complaint, including the identity of the child. The bill
 15 19 amends Code section 915.25 to provide that such a complaint
 15 20 is confidential unless the complaint alleges that the child
 15 21 committed a delinquent act that if committed by an adult would
 15 22 be a forcible felony. However, the bill authorizes state and
 15 23 local enforcement officials to release a confidential complaint
 15 24 against a child if the child is at large and doing so is deemed
 15 25 necessary for the protection of the public or the safety of
 15 26 the child. If the complaint is not confidential because the
 15 27 alleged delinquent act is an act that would be a forcible
 15 28 felony if committed by an adult, the court, its designee,
 15 29 or law enforcement officials may release such a complaint,
 15 30 including the identity of the child.
 15 31    The bill provides that an intake or juvenile court officer
 15 32 shall disclose to the alleged victim of a delinquent act, upon
 15 33 request, the complaint, the name and address of the child who
 15 34 allegedly committed the delinquent act, and the disposition
 15 35 of the complaint. If the alleged delinquent act would be
 16  1 a forcible felony if committed by an adult, the intake or
 16  2 juvenile court officer shall provide notification to the victim
 16  3 as required by Code section 915.24.
 16  4    SEALING OF JUVENILE COURT RECORDS UNAVAILABLE FOR
 16  5 OPERATING=WHILE=INTOXICATED VIOLATIONS.  Under current Code
 16  6 section 232.150, a court shall order juvenile court records
 16  7 to be sealed if the person who is the subject of the juvenile
 16  8 court records is 18 years of age or older and 2 years have
 16  9 elapsed since the last official action in the person's case,
 16 10 the person has not been subsequently convicted of a felony
 16 11 or an aggravated or serious misdemeanor or adjudicated a
 16 12 delinquent child for an act which if committed by an adult
 16 13 would be a felony, an aggravated misdemeanor, or a serious
 16 14 misdemeanor and no proceeding is pending seeking such
 16 15 conviction or adjudication, and the person was not placed on
 16 16 youthful offender status, transferred back to district court
 16 17 after the youthful offender's 18th birthday, and sentenced for
 16 18 the offense which precipitated the youthful offender placement.
 16 19 The bill in newly designated Code section 232.150(4) provides
 16 20 that the court shall not seal a person's juvenile court records
 16 21 if the person was adjudicated delinquent for violating Code
 16 22 section 321J.2, which prohibits the operation of a motor
 16 23 vehicle while under the influence of alcohol or a drug.
 16 24    RELEASE OF CONFIDENTIAL RECORDS.  The bill provides that a
 16 25 public record which is confidential under the provisions of
 16 26 Code chapter 232 shall only be subject to release upon order of
 16 27 a court in a proceeding under Code chapter 232.
 16 28    EXISTING CONFIDENTIALITY EXEMPTIONS.  The bill retains
 16 29 certain existing exemptions to confidentiality of juvenile
 16 30 court records. Pursuant to Code section 692A.121(8), records
 16 31 concerning sex offense convictions which are committed by
 16 32 minors may be released in the same manner as records of
 16 33 convictions of adults. Pursuant to Code section 915.10A,
 16 34 information concerning a juvenile charged with a felony offense
 16 35 may be released pursuant to an automated victim notification
 17  1 system. Under the bill, these exemptions to confidentiality
 17  2 are not amended and therefore still apply to juvenile court
 17  3 records.
 17  4    RIGHT TO COUNSEL.  The bill in Code section 232.11 provides
 17  5 that a child has the right to be represented by counsel at a
 17  6 hearing on a confidentiality order under Code section 232.149A
 17  7 or a public records order under Code section 232.149B.
 17  8    APPLICABILITY.  The bill applies to juvenile delinquency
 17  9 proceedings which are pending or arise on or after July 1,
 17 10 2016.

 11  9 trafficking, arson in the first degree, or burglary in the
 11 10 first degree. If juvenile records are not confidential, the
 11 11 bill provides that a juvenile court officer may release such
 11 12 records.
 11 13    CONFIDENTIALITY ORDERS.  The bill in Code section 232.149A
 11 14 provides that a court shall order juvenile court records
 11 15 alleging the commission of a delinquent act that would be a
 11 16 forcible felony if committed by an adult to be confidential
 11 17 if the court finds that the case has been dismissed and the
 11 18 person is no longer subject to the jurisdiction of the juvenile
 11 19 court and that the child's interest in making the records
 11 20 confidential outweighs the public's interest in the records
 11 21 remaining public records.
 11 22    ACCESS TO CONFIDENTIAL JUVENILE RECORDS.  The bill and
 11 23 Code section 232.147(3) provide that unless an order sealing
 11 24 confidential juvenile records has been entered, confidential
 11 25 juvenile records may still be inspected, without a court
 11 26 order, by the judge and professional court staff, including
 11 27 juvenile court officers; the child and the child's counsel;
 11 28 the child's parent, guardian or custodian, court appointed
 11 29 special advocate, and guardian ad litem, and the members of
 11 30 the child advocacy board created in Code section 237.16 or a
 11 31 local citizen foster care review board created in accordance
 11 32 with Code section 237.19 who are assigning or reviewing the
 11 33 child's case; the county attorney and the county attorney's
 11 34 assistants; an agency, association, facility, or institution
 11 35 which has custody of the child, or is legally responsible for
 12  1 the care, treatment, or supervision of the child, including
 12  2 the department of human services; a court, court professional
 12  3 staff, and adult probation officers in connection with the
 12  4 preparation of a presentence report concerning a person
 12  5 who prior thereto had been the subject of a juvenile court
 12  6 delinquency proceeding; the child's foster parent or an
 12  7 individual providing preadoptive care to the child; the state
 12  8 public defender; the department of corrections; a judicial
 12  9 district department of correctional services; the board of
 12 10 parole; the superintendent or the superintendent's designee of
 12 11 the school district for the school attended by the child or
 12 12 the authorities in charge of an accredited nonpublic school
 12 13 attended by the child; a member of the armed forces of the
 12 14 United States who is conducting a background investigation of
 12 15 an individual pursuant to federal law; the statistical analysis
 12 16 center for the purposes stated in Code section 216A.136; a
 12 17 state or local law enforcement agency; and the alleged victim
 12 18 of any delinquent act in the proceeding.
 12 19    The bill in newly designated Code section 232.147(3A)
 12 20 provides that juvenile court records containing a petition or
 12 21 complaint alleging the commission of a delinquent act that
 12 22 would be a forcible felony if committed by an adult shall be
 12 23 public records unless subject to a confidentiality order under
 12 24 Code section 232.149A or a sealing order under Code section
 12 25 232.150.  However, the bill provides that such official records
 12 26 shall not be available to the public or any governmental
 12 27 agency through the internet or in an electronic customized
 12 28 data report unless the child has been adjudicated delinquent
 12 29 in the matter.  Nevertheless, the bill provides that official
 12 30 juvenile court records may be disclosed without a court order
 12 31 through the internet or in an electronic customized data
 12 32 report prior to the child being adjudicated delinquent to the
 12 33 judge and professional court staff, including juvenile court
 12 34 officers; the child's counsel or guardian ad litem; the county
 12 35 attorney and the county attorney's assistants; a court, court
 13  1 professional staff, and adult probation officers in connection
 13  2 with the preparation of a presentence report concerning a
 13  3 person who prior thereto had been the subject of a juvenile
 13  4 court proceeding; a state or local law enforcement agency; the
 13  5 state public defender; the statistical analysis center for
 13  6 the purposes stated in Code section 216A.136; the department
 13  7 of human services; the department of corrections; a judicial
 13  8 district department of correctional services; and the board of
 13  9 parole.
 13 10    CONFIDENTIALITY OF TRANSCRIPTS.  The bill in newly
 13 11 designated Code section 232.147(3B) provides that if the court
 13 12 has excluded the public from a hearing pursuant to Code section
 13 13 232.39 or 232.92, the transcript of the proceedings shall not
 13 14 be deemed a public record and inspection and disclosure of
 13 15 the contents of the transcript shall not be permitted except
 13 16 pursuant to a court order or unless otherwise provided in Code
 13 17 chapter 232.
 13 18    USE OF ADJUDICATION OF DELINQUENCY FOR PENALTY ENHANCEMENTS
 13 19 OR EVIDENCE.  The bill in newly designated Code section
 13 20 232.147(13) provides that the confidentiality of a final
 13 21 adjudication of delinquency under Code section 232.147 or
 13 22 pursuant to Code section 232.149A shall not prohibit the state
 13 23 from pleading or proving the adjudication at a subsequent
 13 24 criminal or delinquency proceeding for the purpose of penalty
 13 25 enhancement when a provision of the Code specifically deems the
 13 26 delinquency adjudication to constitute a final conviction.
 13 27    The bill in newly designated Code section 232.147(14)
 13 28 provides that the provisions of the bill shall not be construed
 13 29 to limit or restrict the production, use, or introduction
 13 30 of official juvenile court records in any juvenile or adult
 13 31 criminal proceeding, where such records are relevant and deemed
 13 32 admissible under any other provision of the law.
 13 33    CONFIDENTIALITY OF RECORDS AND FILES OF CRIMINAL OR
 13 34 JUVENILE JUSTICE AGENCIES.  Under current law, records and
 13 35 files of a criminal or juvenile justice agency concerning
 14  1 a child involved in a delinquent act are public records,
 14  2 subject to certain exceptions. The bill in Code section
 14  3 232.149 provides that the records and files of a criminal or
 14  4 juvenile justice agency, an intake officer, or a juvenile court
 14  5 officer concerning a child involved in a delinquent act are
 14  6 confidential. The bill further provides that the records of an
 14  7 intake officer or juvenile court officer containing a dismissal
 14  8 of a complaint or an informal adjustment of a complaint when
 14  9 no petition is filed relating to the complaint, shall not be
 14 10 available to the public, but may be disclosed to the judge and
 14 11 professional court staff, including juvenile court officers;
 14 12 the child's counsel or guardian ad litem; the county attorney
 14 13 and county attorney's assistants;  the superintendent or the
 14 14 superintendent's designee of the school district for the
 14 15 school attended by the child or the authorities in charge of
 14 16 an accredited nonpublic school attended by the child; a member
 14 17 of the armed forces of the United States who is conducting a
 14 18 background investigation of an individual pursuant to federal
 14 19 law; the statistical analysis center for the purposes stated
 14 20 in Code section 216A.136; the state public defender;  the
 14 21 department of human services; and the alleged victim of the
 14 22 delinquent act.
 14 23    PUBLIC RECORDS HEARINGS.  The bill enacts new Code section
 14 24 232.149B, which provides that a person may apply for a court
 14 25 order to make confidential juvenile court records public.
 14 26 The bill provides that a rebuttable presumption exists that
 14 27 official juvenile court records shall remain confidential. The
 14 28 bill provides that the court shall order the official juvenile
 14 29 court records in such a delinquency proceeding to be public
 14 30 records if either the public's interest in making the records
 14 31 public outweighs the juvenile's interest in maintaining the
 14 32 confidentiality of the records or the juvenile has been placed
 14 33 on youthful offender status pursuant to Code section 232.45(7)
 14 34 and Code section 907.3A(1), and will be transferred back to
 14 35 the district court for sentencing prior to the child's 18th
 15  1 birthday. The court may order the official juvenile court
 15  2 records in such a delinquency proceeding to be public records
 15  3 if the juvenile has been subsequently adjudicated delinquent
 15  4 for a public offense that would be a serious misdemeanor,
 15  5 aggravated misdemeanor, or felony offense if committed by an
 15  6 adult, or another delinquency proceeding is pending seeking
 15  7 such an adjudication. The bill provides that records subject
 15  8 to a public records order may be sealed at a later date
 15  9 pursuant to Code section 232.150.
 15 10    RIGHT TO REVIEW AND RELEASE A CONFIDENTIAL COMPLAINT.  The
 15 11 bill provides that delinquency complaints shall be released
 15 12 in accordance with Code section 915.25. Under current Code
 15 13 section 915.25, a complaint which alleges that a child who is
 15 14 at least 10 years of age committed a delinquent act, which if
 15 15 committed by an adult would be a public offense, is a public
 15 16 record. Current Code section 915.25 authorizes the court,
 15 17 its designee, or law enforcement officials to release such
 15 18 a complaint, including the identity of the child. The bill
 15 19 amends Code section 915.25 to provide that such a complaint
 15 20 is confidential unless the complaint alleges that the child
 15 21 committed a delinquent act that if committed by an adult would
 15 22 be a forcible felony. However, the bill authorizes state and
 15 23 local enforcement officials to release a confidential complaint
 15 24 against a child if the child is at large and doing so is deemed
 15 25 necessary for the protection of the public or the safety of
 15 26 the child. If the complaint is not confidential because the
 15 27 alleged delinquent act is an act that would be a forcible
 15 28 felony if committed by an adult, the court, its designee,
 15 29 or law enforcement officials may release such a complaint,
 15 30 including the identity of the child.
 15 31    The bill provides that an intake or juvenile court officer
 15 32 shall disclose to the alleged victim of a delinquent act, upon
 15 33 request, the complaint, the name and address of the child who
 15 34 allegedly committed the delinquent act, and the disposition
 15 35 of the complaint. If the alleged delinquent act would be
 16  1 a forcible felony if committed by an adult, the intake or
 16  2 juvenile court officer shall provide notification to the victim
 16  3 as required by Code section 915.24.
 16  4    SEALING OF JUVENILE COURT RECORDS UNAVAILABLE FOR
 16  5 OPERATING=WHILE=INTOXICATED VIOLATIONS.  Under current Code
 16  6 section 232.150, a court shall order juvenile court records
 16  7 to be sealed if the person who is the subject of the juvenile
 16  8 court records is 18 years of age or older and 2 years have
 16  9 elapsed since the last official action in the person's case,
 16 10 the person has not been subsequently convicted of a felony
 16 11 or an aggravated or serious misdemeanor or adjudicated a
 16 12 delinquent child for an act which if committed by an adult
 16 13 would be a felony, an aggravated misdemeanor, or a serious
 16 14 misdemeanor and no proceeding is pending seeking such
 16 15 conviction or adjudication, and the person was not placed on
 16 16 youthful offender status, transferred back to district court
 16 17 after the youthful offender's 18th birthday, and sentenced for
 16 18 the offense which precipitated the youthful offender placement.
 16 19 The bill in newly designated Code section 232.150(4) provides
 16 20 that the court shall not seal a person's juvenile court records
 16 21 if the person was adjudicated delinquent for violating Code
 16 22 section 321J.2, which prohibits the operation of a motor
 16 23 vehicle while under the influence of alcohol or a drug.
 16 24    RELEASE OF CONFIDENTIAL RECORDS.  The bill provides that a
 16 25 public record which is confidential under the provisions of
 16 26 Code chapter 232 shall only be subject to release upon order of
 16 27 a court in a proceeding under Code chapter 232.
 16 28    EXISTING CONFIDENTIALITY EXEMPTIONS.  The bill retains
 16 29 certain existing exemptions to confidentiality of juvenile
 16 30 court records. Pursuant to Code section 692A.121(8), records
 16 31 concerning sex offense convictions which are committed by
 16 32 minors may be released in the same manner as records of
 16 33 convictions of adults. Pursuant to Code section 915.10A,
 16 34 information concerning a juvenile charged with a felony offense
 16 35 may be released pursuant to an automated victim notification
 17  1 system. Under the bill, these exemptions to confidentiality
 17  2 are not amended and therefore still apply to juvenile court
 17  3 records.
 17  4    RIGHT TO COUNSEL.  The bill in Code section 232.11 provides
 17  5 that a child has the right to be represented by counsel at a
 17  6 hearing on a confidentiality order under Code section 232.149A
 17  7 or a public records order under Code section 232.149B.

 11 11 bill provides that a juvenile court officer may release such
 11 12 records.
 11 13    CONFIDENTIALITY ORDERS.  The bill in Code section 232.149A
 11 14 provides that a court shall order juvenile court records
 11 15 alleging the commission of a delinquent act that would be a
 11 16 forcible felony if committed by an adult to be confidential
 11 17 if the court finds that the case has been dismissed and the
 11 18 person is no longer subject to the jurisdiction of the juvenile
 11 19 court and that the child's interest in making the records
 11 20 confidential outweighs the public's interest in the records
 11 21 remaining public records.
 11 22    ACCESS TO CONFIDENTIAL JUVENILE RECORDS.  The bill and
 11 23 Code section 232.147(3) provide that unless an order sealing
 11 24 confidential juvenile records has been entered, confidential
 11 25 juvenile records may still be inspected, without a court
 11 26 order, by the judge and professional court staff, including
 11 27 juvenile court officers; the child and the child's counsel;

 11 31 local citizen foster care review board created in accordance
 11 32 with Code section 237.19 who are assigning or reviewing the
 11 33 child's case; the county attorney and the county attorney's
 11 34 assistants; an agency, association, facility, or institution
 11 35 which has custody of the child, or is legally responsible for
 12  1 the care, treatment, or supervision of the child, including
 12  2 the department of human services; a court, court professional
 12  3 staff, and adult probation officers in connection with the
 12  4 preparation of a presentence report concerning a person
 12  5 who prior thereto had been the subject of a juvenile court
 12  6 delinquency proceeding; the child's foster parent or an
 12  7 individual providing preadoptive care to the child; the state
 12  8 public defender; the department of corrections; a judicial
 12  9 district department of correctional services; the board of
 12 10 parole; the superintendent or the superintendent's designee of
 12 11 the school district for the school attended by the child or
 12 12 the authorities in charge of an accredited nonpublic school
 12 13 attended by the child; a member of the armed forces of the
 12 14 United States who is conducting a background investigation of
 12 15 an individual pursuant to federal law; the statistical analysis
 12 16 center for the purposes stated in Code section 216A.136; a
 12 17 state or local law enforcement agency; and the alleged victim
 12 18 of any delinquent act in the proceeding.
 12 19    The bill in newly designated Code section 232.147(3A)
 12 20 provides that juvenile court records containing a petition or
 12 21 complaint alleging the commission of a delinquent act that
 12 22 would be a forcible felony if committed by an adult shall be
 12 23 public records unless subject to a confidentiality order under
 12 24 Code section 232.149A or a sealing order under Code section
 12 25 232.150.  However, the bill provides that such official records
 12 26 shall not be available to the public or any governmental
 12 27 agency through the internet or in an electronic customized
 12 28 data report unless the child has been adjudicated delinquent
 12 29 in the matter.  Nevertheless, the bill provides that official
 12 30 juvenile court records may be disclosed without a court order
 12 31 through the internet or in an electronic customized data
 12 32 report prior to the child being adjudicated delinquent to the
 12 33 judge and professional court staff, including juvenile court
 12 34 officers; the child's counsel or guardian ad litem; the county
 12 35 attorney and the county attorney's assistants; a court, court
 13  1 professional staff, and adult probation officers in connection
 13  2 with the preparation of a presentence report concerning a

 13  9 parole.
 13 10    CONFIDENTIALITY OF TRANSCRIPTS.  The bill in newly
 13 11 designated Code section 232.147(3B) provides that if the court
 13 12 has excluded the public from a hearing pursuant to Code section
 13 13 232.39 or 232.92, the transcript of the proceedings shall not
 13 14 be deemed a public record and inspection and disclosure of
 13 15 the contents of the transcript shall not be permitted except
 13 16 pursuant to a court order or unless otherwise provided in Code
 13 17 chapter 232.
 13 18    USE OF ADJUDICATION OF DELINQUENCY FOR PENALTY ENHANCEMENTS
 13 19 OR EVIDENCE.  The bill in newly designated Code section
 13 20 232.147(13) provides that the confidentiality of a final
 13 21 adjudication of delinquency under Code section 232.147 or
 13 22 pursuant to Code section 232.149A shall not prohibit the state
 13 23 from pleading or proving the adjudication at a subsequent
 13 24 criminal or delinquency proceeding for the purpose of penalty
 13 25 enhancement when a provision of the Code specifically deems the
 13 26 delinquency adjudication to constitute a final conviction.
 13 27    The bill in newly designated Code section 232.147(14)
 13 28 provides that the provisions of the bill shall not be construed
 13 29 to limit or restrict the production, use, or introduction
 13 30 of official juvenile court records in any juvenile or adult
 13 31 criminal proceeding, where such records are relevant and deemed
 13 32 admissible under any other provision of the law.
 13 33    CONFIDENTIALITY OF RECORDS AND FILES OF CRIMINAL OR
 13 34 JUVENILE JUSTICE AGENCIES.  Under current law, records and
 13 35 files of a criminal or juvenile justice agency concerning
 14  1 a child involved in a delinquent act are public records,
 14  2 subject to certain exceptions. The bill in Code section
 14  3 232.149 provides that the records and files of a criminal or
 14  4 juvenile justice agency, an intake officer, or a juvenile court
 14  5 officer concerning a child involved in a delinquent act are
 14  6 confidential. The bill further provides that the records of an
 14  7 intake officer or juvenile court officer containing a dismissal
 14  8 of a complaint or an informal adjustment of a complaint when
 14  9 no petition is filed relating to the complaint, shall not be
 14 10 available to the public, but may be disclosed to the judge and

 14 21 department of human services; and the alleged victim of the
 14 22 delinquent act.
 14 23    PUBLIC RECORDS HEARINGS.  The bill enacts new Code section
 14 24 232.149B, which provides that a person may apply for a court
 14 25 order to make confidential juvenile court records public.
 14 26 The bill provides that a rebuttable presumption exists that
 14 27 official juvenile court records shall remain confidential. The
 14 28 bill provides that the court shall order the official juvenile
 14 29 court records in such a delinquency proceeding to be public
 14 30 records if either the public's interest in making the records
 14 31 public outweighs the juvenile's interest in maintaining the
 14 32 confidentiality of the records or the juvenile has been placed
 14 33 on youthful offender status pursuant to Code section 232.45(7)
 14 34 and Code section 907.3A(1), and will be transferred back to
 14 35 the district court for sentencing prior to the child's 18th
 15  1 birthday. The court may order the official juvenile court
 15  2 records in such a delinquency proceeding to be public records
 15  3 if the juvenile has been subsequently adjudicated delinquent
 15  4 for a public offense that would be a serious misdemeanor,
 15  5 aggravated misdemeanor, or felony offense if committed by an
 15  6 adult, or another delinquency proceeding is pending seeking
 15  7 such an adjudication. The bill provides that records subject
 15  8 to a public records order may be sealed at a later date
 15  9 pursuant to Code section 232.150.
 15 10    RIGHT TO REVIEW AND RELEASE A CONFIDENTIAL COMPLAINT.  The
 15 11 bill provides that delinquency complaints shall be released
 15 12 in accordance with Code section 915.25. Under current Code
 15 13 section 915.25, a complaint which alleges that a child who is
 15 14 at least 10 years of age committed a delinquent act, which if
 15 15 committed by an adult would be a public offense, is a public
 15 16 record. Current Code section 915.25 authorizes the court,
 15 17 its designee, or law enforcement officials to release such
 15 18 a complaint, including the identity of the child. The bill
 15 19 amends Code section 915.25 to provide that such a complaint
 15 20 is confidential unless the complaint alleges that the child
 15 21 committed a delinquent act that if committed by an adult would
 15 22 be a forcible felony. However, the bill authorizes state and
 15 23 local enforcement officials to release a confidential complaint
 15 24 against a child if the child is at large and doing so is deemed
 15 25 necessary for the protection of the public or the safety of
 15 26 the child. If the complaint is not confidential because the
 15 27 alleged delinquent act is an act that would be a forcible
 15 28 felony if committed by an adult, the court, its designee,
 15 29 or law enforcement officials may release such a complaint,
 15 30 including the identity of the child.
 15 31    The bill provides that an intake or juvenile court officer
 15 32 shall disclose to the alleged victim of a delinquent act, upon
 15 33 request, the complaint, the name and address of the child who
 15 34 allegedly committed the delinquent act, and the disposition
 15 35 of the complaint. If the alleged delinquent act would be
 16  1 a forcible felony if committed by an adult, the intake or
 16  2 juvenile court officer shall provide notification to the victim
 16  3 as required by Code section 915.24.
 16  4    SEALING OF JUVENILE COURT RECORDS UNAVAILABLE FOR
 16  5 OPERATING=WHILE=INTOXICATED VIOLATIONS.  Under current Code
 16  6 section 232.150, a court shall order juvenile court records
 16  7 to be sealed if the person who is the subject of the juvenile
 16  8 court records is 18 years of age or older and 2 years have
 16  9 elapsed since the last official action in the person's case,
 16 10 the person has not been subsequently convicted of a felony
 16 11 or an aggravated or serious misdemeanor or adjudicated a
 16 12 delinquent child for an act which if committed by an adult
 16 13 would be a felony, an aggravated misdemeanor, or a serious
 16 14 misdemeanor and no proceeding is pending seeking such
 16 15 conviction or adjudication, and the person was not placed on
 16 16 youthful offender status, transferred back to district court
 16 17 after the youthful offender's 18th birthday, and sentenced for
 16 18 the offense which precipitated the youthful offender placement.
 16 19 The bill in newly designated Code section 232.150(4) provides
 16 20 that the court shall not seal a person's juvenile court records
 16 21 if the person was adjudicated delinquent for violating Code
 16 22 section 321J.2, which prohibits the operation of a motor
 16 23 vehicle while under the influence of alcohol or a drug.
 16 24    RELEASE OF CONFIDENTIAL RECORDS.  The bill provides that a
 16 25 public record which is confidential under the provisions of
 16 26 Code chapter 232 shall only be subject to release upon order of
 16 27 a court in a proceeding under Code chapter 232.
 16 28    EXISTING CONFIDENTIALITY EXEMPTIONS.  The bill retains
 16 29 certain existing exemptions to confidentiality of juvenile
 16 30 court records. Pursuant to Code section 692A.121(8), records
 16 31 concerning sex offense convictions which are committed by
 16 32 minors may be released in the same manner as records of
 16 33 convictions of adults. Pursuant to Code section 915.10A,
 16 34 information concerning a juvenile charged with a felony offense
 16 35 may be released pursuant to an automated victim notification
 17  1 system. Under the bill, these exemptions to confidentiality
 17  2 are not amended and therefore still apply to juvenile court
 17  3 records.
 17  4    RIGHT TO COUNSEL.  The bill in Code section 232.11 provides
 17  5 that a child has the right to be represented by counsel at a
 17  6 hearing on a confidentiality order under Code section 232.149A
 17  7 or a public records order under Code section 232.149B.
 17  8    APPLICABILITY.  The bill applies to juvenile delinquency
 17  9 proceedings which are pending or arise on or after July 1,
 17 10 2016.
       LSB 5193HV (4) 86
       jh/rj
 11 11 bill provides that a juvenile court officer may release such
 11 12 records.
 11 13    CONFIDENTIALITY ORDERS.  The bill in Code section 232.149A
 11 14 provides that a court shall order juvenile court records
 11 15 alleging the commission of a delinquent act that would be a
 11 16 forcible felony if committed by an adult to be confidential
 11 17 if the court finds that the case has been dismissed and the
 11 18 person is no longer subject to the jurisdiction of the juvenile
 11 19 court and that the child's interest in making the records
 11 20 confidential outweighs the public's interest in the records
 11 21 remaining public records.
 11 22    ACCESS TO CONFIDENTIAL JUVENILE RECORDS.  The bill and
 11 23 Code section 232.147(3) provide that unless an order sealing
 11 24 confidential juvenile records has been entered, confidential
 11 25 juvenile records may still be inspected, without a court
 11 26 order, by the judge and professional court staff, including
 11 27 juvenile court officers; the child and the child's counsel;
 11 28 the child's parent, guardian or custodian, court appointed
 11 29 special advocate, and guardian ad litem, and the members of
 11 30 the child advocacy board created in Code section 237.16 or a
 11 31 local citizen foster care review board created in accordance
 11 32 with Code section 237.19 who are assigning or reviewing the
 11 33 child's case; the county attorney and the county attorney's
 11 34 assistants; an agency, association, facility, or institution
 11 35 which has custody of the child, or is legally responsible for
 12  1 the care, treatment, or supervision of the child, including
 12  2 the department of human services; a court, court professional
 12  3 staff, and adult probation officers in connection with the
 12  4 preparation of a presentence report concerning a person
 12  5 who prior thereto had been the subject of a juvenile court
 12  6 delinquency proceeding; the child's foster parent or an
 12  7 individual providing preadoptive care to the child; the state
 12  8 public defender; the department of corrections; a judicial
 12  9 district department of correctional services; the board of
 12 10 parole; the superintendent or the superintendent's designee of
 12 11 the school district for the school attended by the child or
 12 12 the authorities in charge of an accredited nonpublic school
 12 13 attended by the child; a member of the armed forces of the
 12 14 United States who is conducting a background investigation of
 12 15 an individual pursuant to federal law; the statistical analysis
 12 16 center for the purposes stated in Code section 216A.136; a
 12 17 state or local law enforcement agency; and the alleged victim
 12 18 of any delinquent act in the proceeding.
 12 19    The bill in newly designated Code section 232.147(3A)
 12 20 provides that juvenile court records containing a petition or
 12 21 complaint alleging the commission of a delinquent act that
 12 22 would be a forcible felony if committed by an adult shall be
 12 23 public records unless subject to a confidentiality order under
 12 24 Code section 232.149A or a sealing order under Code section
 12 25 232.150.  However, the bill provides that such official records
 12 26 shall not be available to the public or any governmental
 12 27 agency through the internet or in an electronic customized
 12 28 data report unless the child has been adjudicated delinquent
 12 29 in the matter.  Nevertheless, the bill provides that official
 12 30 juvenile court records may be disclosed without a court order
 12 31 through the internet or in an electronic customized data
 12 32 report prior to the child being adjudicated delinquent to the
 12 33 judge and professional court staff, including juvenile court
 12 34 officers; the child's counsel or guardian ad litem; the county
 12 35 attorney and the county attorney's assistants; a court, court
 13  1 professional staff, and adult probation officers in connection
 13  2 with the preparation of a presentence report concerning a
 13  3 person who prior thereto had been the subject of a juvenile
 13  4 court proceeding; a state or local law enforcement agency; the
 13  5 state public defender; the statistical analysis center for
 13  6 the purposes stated in Code section 216A.136; the department
 13  7 of human services; the department of corrections; a judicial
 13  8 district department of correctional services; and the board of
 13  9 parole.
 13 10    CONFIDENTIALITY OF TRANSCRIPTS.  The bill in newly
 13 11 designated Code section 232.147(3B) provides that if the court
 13 12 has excluded the public from a hearing pursuant to Code section
 13 13 232.39 or 232.92, the transcript of the proceedings shall not
 13 14 be deemed a public record and inspection and disclosure of
 13 15 the contents of the transcript shall not be permitted except
 13 16 pursuant to a court order or unless otherwise provided in Code
 13 17 chapter 232.
 13 18    USE OF ADJUDICATION OF DELINQUENCY FOR PENALTY ENHANCEMENTS
 13 19 OR EVIDENCE.  The bill in newly designated Code section
 13 20 232.147(13) provides that the confidentiality of a final
 13 21 adjudication of delinquency under Code section 232.147 or
 13 22 pursuant to Code section 232.149A shall not prohibit the state
 13 23 from pleading or proving the adjudication at a subsequent
 13 24 criminal or delinquency proceeding for the purpose of penalty
 13 25 enhancement when a provision of the Code specifically deems the
 13 26 delinquency adjudication to constitute a final conviction.
 13 27    The bill in newly designated Code section 232.147(14)
 13 28 provides that the provisions of the bill shall not be construed
 13 29 to limit or restrict the production, use, or introduction
 13 30 of official juvenile court records in any juvenile or adult
 13 31 criminal proceeding, where such records are relevant and deemed
 13 32 admissible under any other provision of the law.
 13 33    CONFIDENTIALITY OF RECORDS AND FILES OF CRIMINAL OR
 13 34 JUVENILE JUSTICE AGENCIES.  Under current law, records and
 13 35 files of a criminal or juvenile justice agency concerning
 14  1 a child involved in a delinquent act are public records,
 14  2 subject to certain exceptions. The bill in Code section
 14  3 232.149 provides that the records and files of a criminal or
 14  4 juvenile justice agency, an intake officer, or a juvenile court
 14  5 officer concerning a child involved in a delinquent act are
 14  6 confidential. The bill further provides that the records of an
 14  7 intake officer or juvenile court officer containing a dismissal
 14  8 of a complaint or an informal adjustment of a complaint when
 14  9 no petition is filed relating to the complaint, shall not be
 14 10 available to the public, but may be disclosed to the judge and
 14 11 professional court staff, including juvenile court officers;
 14 12 the child's counsel or guardian ad litem; the county attorney
 14 13 and county attorney's assistants;  the superintendent or the
 14 14 superintendent's designee of the school district for the
 14 15 school attended by the child or the authorities in charge of
 14 16 an accredited nonpublic school attended by the child; a member
 14 17 of the armed forces of the United States who is conducting a
 14 18 background investigation of an individual pursuant to federal
 14 19 law; the statistical analysis center for the purposes stated
 14 20 in Code section 216A.136; the state public defender;  the
 14 21 department of human services; and the alleged victim of the
 14 22 delinquent act.
 14 23    PUBLIC RECORDS HEARINGS.  The bill enacts new Code section
 14 24 232.149B, which provides that a person may apply for a court
 14 25 order to make confidential juvenile court records public.
 14 26 The bill provides that a rebuttable presumption exists that
 14 27 official juvenile court records shall remain confidential. The
 14 28 bill provides that the court shall order the official juvenile
 14 29 court records in such a delinquency proceeding to be public
 14 30 records if either the public's interest in making the records
 14 31 public outweighs the juvenile's interest in maintaining the
 14 32 confidentiality of the records or the juvenile has been placed
 14 33 on youthful offender status pursuant to Code section 232.45(7)
 14 34 and Code section 907.3A(1), and will be transferred back to
 14 35 the district court for sentencing prior to the child's 18th
 15  1 birthday. The court may order the official juvenile court
 15  2 records in such a delinquency proceeding to be public records
 15  3 if the juvenile has been subsequently adjudicated delinquent
 15  4 for a public offense that would be a serious misdemeanor,
 15  5 aggravated misdemeanor, or felony offense if committed by an
 15  6 adult, or another delinquency proceeding is pending seeking
 15  7 such an adjudication. The bill provides that records subject
 15  8 to a public records order may be sealed at a later date
 15  9 pursuant to Code section 232.150.
 15 10    RIGHT TO REVIEW AND RELEASE A CONFIDENTIAL COMPLAINT.  The
 15 11 bill provides that delinquency complaints shall be released
 15 12 in accordance with Code section 915.25. Under current Code
 15 13 section 915.25, a complaint which alleges that a child who is
 15 14 at least 10 years of age committed a delinquent act, which if
 15 15 committed by an adult would be a public offense, is a public
 15 16 record. Current Code section 915.25 authorizes the court,
 15 17 its designee, or law enforcement officials to release such
 15 18 a complaint, including the identity of the child. The bill
 15 19 amends Code section 915.25 to provide that such a complaint
 15 20 is confidential unless the complaint alleges that the child
 15 21 committed a delinquent act that if committed by an adult would
 15 22 be a forcible felony. However, the bill authorizes state and
 15 23 local enforcement officials to release a confidential complaint
 15 24 against a child if the child is at large and doing so is deemed
 15 25 necessary for the protection of the public or the safety of
 15 26 the child. If the complaint is not confidential because the
 15 27 alleged delinquent act is an act that would be a forcible
 15 28 felony if committed by an adult, the court, its designee,
 15 29 or law enforcement officials may release such a complaint,
 15 30 including the identity of the child.
 15 31    The bill provides that an intake or juvenile court officer
 15 32 shall disclose to the alleged victim of a delinquent act, upon
 15 33 request, the complaint, the name and address of the child who
 15 34 allegedly committed the delinquent act, and the disposition
 15 35 of the complaint. If the alleged delinquent act would be
 16  1 a forcible felony if committed by an adult, the intake or
 16  2 juvenile court officer shall provide notification to the victim
 16  3 as required by Code section 915.24.
 16  4    SEALING OF JUVENILE COURT RECORDS UNAVAILABLE FOR
 16  5 OPERATING=WHILE=INTOXICATED VIOLATIONS.  Under current Code
 16  6 section 232.150, a court shall order juvenile court records
 16  7 to be sealed if the person who is the subject of the juvenile
 16  8 court records is 18 years of age or older and 2 years have
 16  9 elapsed since the last official action in the person's case,
 16 10 the person has not been subsequently convicted of a felony
 16 11 or an aggravated or serious misdemeanor or adjudicated a
 16 12 delinquent child for an act which if committed by an adult
 16 13 would be a felony, an aggravated misdemeanor, or a serious
 16 14 misdemeanor and no proceeding is pending seeking such
 16 15 conviction or adjudication, and the person was not placed on
 16 16 youthful offender status, transferred back to district court
 16 17 after the youthful offender's 18th birthday, and sentenced for
 16 18 the offense which precipitated the youthful offender placement.
 16 19 The bill in newly designated Code section 232.150(4) provides
 16 20 that the court shall not seal a person's juvenile court records
 16 21 if the person was adjudicated delinquent for violating Code
 16 22 section 321J.2, which prohibits the operation of a motor
 16 23 vehicle while under the influence of alcohol or a drug.
 16 24    RELEASE OF CONFIDENTIAL RECORDS.  The bill provides that a
 16 25 public record which is confidential under the provisions of
 16 26 Code chapter 232 shall only be subject to release upon order of
 16 27 a court in a proceeding under Code chapter 232.
 16 28    EXISTING CONFIDENTIALITY EXEMPTIONS.  The bill retains
 16 29 certain existing exemptions to confidentiality of juvenile
 16 30 court records. Pursuant to Code section 692A.121(8), records
 16 31 concerning sex offense convictions which are committed by
 16 32 minors may be released in the same manner as records of
 16 33 convictions of adults. Pursuant to Code section 915.10A,
 16 34 information concerning a juvenile charged with a felony offense
 16 35 may be released pursuant to an automated victim notification
 17  1 system. Under the bill, these exemptions to confidentiality
 17  2 are not amended and therefore still apply to juvenile court
 17  3 records.
 17  4    RIGHT TO COUNSEL.  The bill in Code section 232.11 provides
 17  5 that a child has the right to be represented by counsel at a
 17  6 hearing on a confidentiality order under Code section 232.149A
 17  7 or a public records order under Code section 232.149B.

 12 18 of any delinquent act in the proceeding.
 12 19    The bill in newly designated Code section 232.147(3A)
 12 20 provides that juvenile court records containing a petition or
 12 21 complaint alleging the commission of a delinquent act that
 12 22 would be a forcible felony if committed by an adult shall be
 12 23 public records unless subject to a confidentiality order under

 12 29 in the matter.  Nevertheless, the bill provides that official
 12 30 juvenile court records may be disclosed without a court order

 13 18    USE OF ADJUDICATION OF DELINQUENCY FOR PENALTY ENHANCEMENTS
 13 19 OR EVIDENCE.  The bill in newly designated Code section
 13 20 232.147(13) provides that the confidentiality of a final
 13 21 adjudication of delinquency under Code section 232.147 or
 13 22 pursuant to Code section 232.149A shall not prohibit the state
 13 23 from pleading or proving the adjudication at a subsequent

 13 33    CONFIDENTIALITY OF RECORDS AND FILES OF CRIMINAL OR

 14 23    PUBLIC RECORDS HEARINGS.  The bill enacts new Code section
 14 24 232.149B, which provides that a person may apply for a court
 14 25 order to make confidential juvenile court records public.
 14 26 The bill provides that a rebuttable presumption exists that
 14 27 official juvenile court records shall remain confidential. The
 14 28 bill provides that the court shall order the official juvenile
 14 29 court records in such a delinquency proceeding to be public
 14 30 records if either the public's interest in making the records
 14 31 public outweighs the juvenile's interest in maintaining the
 14 32 confidentiality of the records or the juvenile has been placed
 14 33 on youthful offender status pursuant to Code section 232.45(7)
 14 34 and Code section 907.3A(1), and will be transferred back to
 14 35 the district court for sentencing prior to the child's 18th
 15  1 birthday. The court may order the official juvenile court
 15  2 records in such a delinquency proceeding to be public records
 15  3 if the juvenile has been subsequently adjudicated delinquent
 15  4 for a public offense that would be a serious misdemeanor,
 15  5 aggravated misdemeanor, or felony offense if committed by an
 15  6 adult, or another delinquency proceeding is pending seeking
 15  7 such an adjudication. The bill provides that records subject
 15  8 to a public records order may be sealed at a later date
 15  9 pursuant to Code section 232.150.
 15 10    RIGHT TO REVIEW AND RELEASE A CONFIDENTIAL COMPLAINT.  The
 15 11 bill provides that delinquency complaints shall be released
 15 12 in accordance with Code section 915.25. Under current Code
 15 13 section 915.25, a complaint which alleges that a child who is
 15 14 at least 10 years of age committed a delinquent act, which if
 15 15 committed by an adult would be a public offense, is a public
 15 16 record. Current Code section 915.25 authorizes the court,
 15 17 its designee, or law enforcement officials to release such
 15 18 a complaint, including the identity of the child. The bill
 15 19 amends Code section 915.25 to provide that such a complaint
 15 20 is confidential unless the complaint alleges that the child
 15 21 committed a delinquent act that if committed by an adult would
 15 22 be a forcible felony. However, the bill authorizes state and
 15 23 local enforcement officials to release a confidential complaint
 15 24 against a child if the child is at large and doing so is deemed
 15 25 necessary for the protection of the public or the safety of
 15 26 the child. If the complaint is not confidential because the
 15 27 alleged delinquent act is an act that would be a forcible
 15 28 felony if committed by an adult, the court, its designee,
 15 29 or law enforcement officials may release such a complaint,
 15 30 including the identity of the child.
 15 31    The bill provides that an intake or juvenile court officer
 15 32 shall disclose to the alleged victim of a delinquent act, upon
 15 33 request, the complaint, the name and address of the child who
 15 34 allegedly committed the delinquent act, and the disposition
 15 35 of the complaint. If the alleged delinquent act would be
 16  1 a forcible felony if committed by an adult, the intake or
 16  2 juvenile court officer shall provide notification to the victim
 16  3 as required by Code section 915.24.
 16  4    SEALING OF JUVENILE COURT RECORDS UNAVAILABLE FOR
 16  5 OPERATING=WHILE=INTOXICATED VIOLATIONS.  Under current Code
 16  6 section 232.150, a court shall order juvenile court records
 16  7 to be sealed if the person who is the subject of the juvenile
 16  8 court records is 18 years of age or older and 2 years have
 16  9 elapsed since the last official action in the person's case,
 16 10 the person has not been subsequently convicted of a felony
 16 11 or an aggravated or serious misdemeanor or adjudicated a
 16 12 delinquent child for an act which if committed by an adult
 16 13 would be a felony, an aggravated misdemeanor, or a serious
 16 14 misdemeanor and no proceeding is pending seeking such
 16 15 conviction or adjudication, and the person was not placed on
 16 16 youthful offender status, transferred back to district court
 16 17 after the youthful offender's 18th birthday, and sentenced for
 16 18 the offense which precipitated the youthful offender placement.
 16 19 The bill in newly designated Code section 232.150(4) provides
 16 20 that the court shall not seal a person's juvenile court records
 16 21 if the person was adjudicated delinquent for violating Code
 16 22 section 321J.2, which prohibits the operation of a motor
 16 23 vehicle while under the influence of alcohol or a drug.
 16 24    RELEASE OF CONFIDENTIAL RECORDS.  The bill provides that a
 16 25 public record which is confidential under the provisions of
 16 26 Code chapter 232 shall only be subject to release upon order of
 16 27 a court in a proceeding under Code chapter 232.
 16 28    EXISTING CONFIDENTIALITY EXEMPTIONS.  The bill retains
 16 29 certain existing exemptions to confidentiality of juvenile
 16 30 court records. Pursuant to Code section 692A.121(8), records
 16 31 concerning sex offense convictions which are committed by
 16 32 minors may be released in the same manner as records of
 16 33 convictions of adults. Pursuant to Code section 915.10A,
 16 34 information concerning a juvenile charged with a felony offense
 16 35 may be released pursuant to an automated victim notification
 17  1 system. Under the bill, these exemptions to confidentiality
 17  2 are not amended and therefore still apply to juvenile court
 17  3 records.
 17  4    RIGHT TO COUNSEL.  The bill in Code section 232.11 provides
 17  5 that a child has the right to be represented by counsel at a
 17  6 hearing on a confidentiality order under Code section 232.149A
 17  7 or a public records order under Code section 232.149B.
 17  8    APPLICABILITY.  The bill applies to juvenile delinquency
 17  9 proceedings which are pending or arise on or after July 1,
 17 10 2016.

 11 13    CONFIDENTIALITY ORDERS.  The bill in Code section 232.149A
 11 14 provides that a court shall order juvenile court records
 11 15 alleging the commission of a delinquent act that would be a
 11 16 forcible felony if committed by an adult to be confidential
 11 17 if the court finds that the case has been dismissed and the
 11 18 person is no longer subject to the jurisdiction of the juvenile
 11 19 court and that the child's interest in making the records
 11 20 confidential outweighs the public's interest in the records
 11 21 remaining public records.
 11 22    ACCESS TO CONFIDENTIAL JUVENILE RECORDS.  The bill and
 11 23 Code section 232.147(3) provide that unless an order sealing
 11 24 confidential juvenile records has been entered, confidential
 11 25 juvenile records may still be inspected, without a court
 11 26 order, by the judge and professional court staff, including
 11 27 juvenile court officers; the child and the child's counsel;
 11 28 the child's parent, guardian or custodian, court appointed
 11 29 special advocate, and guardian ad litem, and the members of
 11 30 the child advocacy board created in Code section 237.16 or a
 11 31 local citizen foster care review board created in accordance
 11 32 with Code section 237.19 who are assigning or reviewing the
 11 33 child's case; the county attorney and the county attorney's
 11 34 assistants; an agency, association, facility, or institution
 11 35 which has custody of the child, or is legally responsible for
 12  1 the care, treatment, or supervision of the child, including
 12  2 the department of human services; a court, court professional
 12  3 staff, and adult probation officers in connection with the
 12  4 preparation of a presentence report concerning a person
 12  5 who prior thereto had been the subject of a juvenile court
 12  6 delinquency proceeding; the child's foster parent or an
 12  7 individual providing preadoptive care to the child; the state
 12  8 public defender; the department of corrections; a judicial
 12  9 district department of correctional services; the board of
 12 10 parole; the superintendent or the superintendent's designee of
 12 11 the school district for the school attended by the child or
 12 12 the authorities in charge of an accredited nonpublic school
 12 13 attended by the child; a member of the armed forces of the
 12 14 United States who is conducting a background investigation of
 12 15 an individual pursuant to federal law; the statistical analysis
 12 16 center for the purposes stated in Code section 216A.136; a
 12 17 state or local law enforcement agency; and the alleged victim
 12 18 of any delinquent act in the proceeding.
 12 19    The bill in newly designated Code section 232.147(3A)
 12 20 provides that juvenile court records containing a petition or
 12 21 complaint alleging the commission of a delinquent act that
 12 22 would be a forcible felony if committed by an adult shall be
 12 23 public records unless subject to a confidentiality order under
 12 24 Code section 232.149A or a sealing order under Code section
 12 25 232.150.  However, the bill provides that such official records
 12 26 shall not be available to the public or any governmental
 12 27 agency through the internet or in an electronic customized
 12 28 data report unless the child has been adjudicated delinquent
 12 29 in the matter.  Nevertheless, the bill provides that official
 12 30 juvenile court records may be disclosed without a court order
 12 31 through the internet or in an electronic customized data
 12 32 report prior to the child being adjudicated delinquent to the
 12 33 judge and professional court staff, including juvenile court
 12 34 officers; the child's counsel or guardian ad litem; the county
 12 35 attorney and the county attorney's assistants; a court, court
 13  1 professional staff, and adult probation officers in connection
 13  2 with the preparation of a presentence report concerning a
 13  3 person who prior thereto had been the subject of a juvenile
 13  4 court proceeding; a state or local law enforcement agency; the
 13  5 state public defender; the statistical analysis center for
 13  6 the purposes stated in Code section 216A.136; the department
 13  7 of human services; the department of corrections; a judicial
 13  8 district department of correctional services; and the board of
 13  9 parole.
 13 10    CONFIDENTIALITY OF TRANSCRIPTS.  The bill in newly
 13 11 designated Code section 232.147(3B) provides that if the court
 13 12 has excluded the public from a hearing pursuant to Code section
 13 13 232.39 or 232.92, the transcript of the proceedings shall not
 13 14 be deemed a public record and inspection and disclosure of
 13 15 the contents of the transcript shall not be permitted except
 13 16 pursuant to a court order or unless otherwise provided in Code
 13 17 chapter 232.
 13 18    USE OF ADJUDICATION OF DELINQUENCY FOR PENALTY ENHANCEMENTS
 13 19 OR EVIDENCE.  The bill in newly designated Code section
 13 20 232.147(13) provides that the confidentiality of a final
 13 21 adjudication of delinquency under Code section 232.147 or
 13 22 pursuant to Code section 232.149A shall not prohibit the state
 13 23 from pleading or proving the adjudication at a subsequent
 13 24 criminal or delinquency proceeding for the purpose of penalty
 13 25 enhancement when a provision of the Code specifically deems the
 13 26 delinquency adjudication to constitute a final conviction.
 13 27    The bill in newly designated Code section 232.147(14)
 13 28 provides that the provisions of the bill shall not be construed
 13 29 to limit or restrict the production, use, or introduction
 13 30 of official juvenile court records in any juvenile or adult
 13 31 criminal proceeding, where such records are relevant and deemed
 13 32 admissible under any other provision of the law.
 13 33    CONFIDENTIALITY OF RECORDS AND FILES OF CRIMINAL OR
 13 34 JUVENILE JUSTICE AGENCIES.  Under current law, records and
 13 35 files of a criminal or juvenile justice agency concerning
 14  1 a child involved in a delinquent act are public records,
 14  2 subject to certain exceptions. The bill in Code section
 14  3 232.149 provides that the records and files of a criminal or
 14  4 juvenile justice agency, an intake officer, or a juvenile court
 14  5 officer concerning a child involved in a delinquent act are
 14  6 confidential. The bill further provides that the records of an
 14  7 intake officer or juvenile court officer containing a dismissal
 14  8 of a complaint or an informal adjustment of a complaint when
 14  9 no petition is filed relating to the complaint, shall not be
 14 10 available to the public, but may be disclosed to the judge and
 14 11 professional court staff, including juvenile court officers;
 14 12 the child's counsel or guardian ad litem; the county attorney
 14 13 and county attorney's assistants;  the superintendent or the

 14 19 law; the statistical analysis center for the purposes stated
 14 20 in Code section 216A.136; the state public defender;  the
 14 21 department of human services; and the alleged victim of the
 14 22 delinquent act.
 14 23    PUBLIC RECORDS HEARINGS.  The bill enacts new Code section
 14 24 232.149B, which provides that a person may apply for a court
 14 25 order to make confidential juvenile court records public.
 14 26 The bill provides that a rebuttable presumption exists that
 14 27 official juvenile court records shall remain confidential. The
 14 28 bill provides that the court shall order the official juvenile
 14 29 court records in such a delinquency proceeding to be public
 14 30 records if either the public's interest in making the records
 14 31 public outweighs the juvenile's interest in maintaining the
 14 32 confidentiality of the records or the juvenile has been placed
 14 33 on youthful offender status pursuant to Code section 232.45(7)
 14 34 and Code section 907.3A(1), and will be transferred back to
 14 35 the district court for sentencing prior to the child's 18th
 15  1 birthday. The court may order the official juvenile court
 15  2 records in such a delinquency proceeding to be public records
 15  3 if the juvenile has been subsequently adjudicated delinquent
 15  4 for a public offense that would be a serious misdemeanor,
 15  5 aggravated misdemeanor, or felony offense if committed by an
 15  6 adult, or another delinquency proceeding is pending seeking
 15  7 such an adjudication. The bill provides that records subject
 15  8 to a public records order may be sealed at a later date
 15  9 pursuant to Code section 232.150.
 15 10    RIGHT TO REVIEW AND RELEASE A CONFIDENTIAL COMPLAINT.  The
 15 11 bill provides that delinquency complaints shall be released
 15 12 in accordance with Code section 915.25. Under current Code
 15 13 section 915.25, a complaint which alleges that a child who is
 15 14 at least 10 years of age committed a delinquent act, which if
 15 15 committed by an adult would be a public offense, is a public
 15 16 record. Current Code section 915.25 authorizes the court,
 15 17 its designee, or law enforcement officials to release such
 15 18 a complaint, including the identity of the child. The bill
 15 19 amends Code section 915.25 to provide that such a complaint
 15 20 is confidential unless the complaint alleges that the child
 15 21 committed a delinquent act that if committed by an adult would
 15 22 be a forcible felony. However, the bill authorizes state and
 15 23 local enforcement officials to release a confidential complaint
 15 24 against a child if the child is at large and doing so is deemed
 15 25 necessary for the protection of the public or the safety of
 15 26 the child. If the complaint is not confidential because the
 15 27 alleged delinquent act is an act that would be a forcible
 15 28 felony if committed by an adult, the court, its designee,
 15 29 or law enforcement officials may release such a complaint,
 15 30 including the identity of the child.
 15 31    The bill provides that an intake or juvenile court officer
 15 32 shall disclose to the alleged victim of a delinquent act, upon
 15 33 request, the complaint, the name and address of the child who
 15 34 allegedly committed the delinquent act, and the disposition
 15 35 of the complaint. If the alleged delinquent act would be
 16  1 a forcible felony if committed by an adult, the intake or
 16  2 juvenile court officer shall provide notification to the victim
 16  3 as required by Code section 915.24.
 16  4    SEALING OF JUVENILE COURT RECORDS UNAVAILABLE FOR
 16  5 OPERATING=WHILE=INTOXICATED VIOLATIONS.  Under current Code
 16  6 section 232.150, a court shall order juvenile court records
 16  7 to be sealed if the person who is the subject of the juvenile
 16  8 court records is 18 years of age or older and 2 years have
 16  9 elapsed since the last official action in the person's case,
 16 10 the person has not been subsequently convicted of a felony
 16 11 or an aggravated or serious misdemeanor or adjudicated a
 16 12 delinquent child for an act which if committed by an adult
 16 13 would be a felony, an aggravated misdemeanor, or a serious

 16 20 that the court shall not seal a person's juvenile court records
 16 21 if the person was adjudicated delinquent for violating Code
 16 22 section 321J.2, which prohibits the operation of a motor
 16 23 vehicle while under the influence of alcohol or a drug.
 16 24    RELEASE OF CONFIDENTIAL RECORDS.  The bill provides that a
 16 25 public record which is confidential under the provisions of
 16 26 Code chapter 232 shall only be subject to release upon order of
 16 27 a court in a proceeding under Code chapter 232.

 14 13 and county attorney's assistants;  the superintendent or the
 14 14 superintendent's designee of the school district for the
 14 15 school attended by the child or the authorities in charge of
 14 16 an accredited nonpublic school attended by the child; a member
 14 17 of the armed forces of the United States who is conducting a
 14 18 background investigation of an individual pursuant to federal
 14 19 law; the statistical analysis center for the purposes stated
 14 20 in Code section 216A.136; the state public defender;  the
 14 21 department of human services; and the alleged victim of the
 14 22 delinquent act.
 14 23    PUBLIC RECORDS HEARINGS.  The bill enacts new Code section
 14 24 232.149B, which provides that a person may apply for a court
 14 25 order to make confidential juvenile court records public.
 14 26 The bill provides that a rebuttable presumption exists that
 14 27 official juvenile court records shall remain confidential. The
 14 28 bill provides that the court shall order the official juvenile
 14 29 court records in such a delinquency proceeding to be public
 14 30 records if either the public's interest in making the records
 14 31 public outweighs the juvenile's interest in maintaining the
 14 32 confidentiality of the records or the juvenile has been placed
 14 33 on youthful offender status pursuant to Code section 232.45(7)
 14 34 and Code section 907.3A(1), and will be transferred back to
 14 35 the district court for sentencing prior to the child's 18th
 15  1 birthday. The court may order the official juvenile court
 15  2 records in such a delinquency proceeding to be public records
 15  3 if the juvenile has been subsequently adjudicated delinquent
 15  4 for a public offense that would be a serious misdemeanor,
 15  5 aggravated misdemeanor, or felony offense if committed by an
 15  6 adult, or another delinquency proceeding is pending seeking
 15  7 such an adjudication. The bill provides that records subject
 15  8 to a public records order may be sealed at a later date
 15  9 pursuant to Code section 232.150.
 15 10    RIGHT TO REVIEW AND RELEASE A CONFIDENTIAL COMPLAINT.  The
 15 11 bill provides that delinquency complaints shall be released
 15 12 in accordance with Code section 915.25. Under current Code
 15 13 section 915.25, a complaint which alleges that a child who is
 15 14 at least 10 years of age committed a delinquent act, which if
 15 15 committed by an adult would be a public offense, is a public
 15 16 record. Current Code section 915.25 authorizes the court,
 15 17 its designee, or law enforcement officials to release such
 15 18 a complaint, including the identity of the child. The bill
 15 19 amends Code section 915.25 to provide that such a complaint
 15 20 is confidential unless the complaint alleges that the child
 15 21 committed a delinquent act that if committed by an adult would
 15 22 be a forcible felony. However, the bill authorizes state and
 15 23 local enforcement officials to release a confidential complaint
 15 24 against a child if the child is at large and doing so is deemed
 15 25 necessary for the protection of the public or the safety of
 15 26 the child. If the complaint is not confidential because the
 15 27 alleged delinquent act is an act that would be a forcible
 15 28 felony if committed by an adult, the court, its designee,
 15 29 or law enforcement officials may release such a complaint,
 15 30 including the identity of the child.
 15 31    The bill provides that an intake or juvenile court officer
 15 32 shall disclose to the alleged victim of a delinquent act, upon
 15 33 request, the complaint, the name and address of the child who
 15 34 allegedly committed the delinquent act, and the disposition
 15 35 of the complaint. If the alleged delinquent act would be
 16  1 a forcible felony if committed by an adult, the intake or
 16  2 juvenile court officer shall provide notification to the victim
 16  3 as required by Code section 915.24.
 16  4    SEALING OF JUVENILE COURT RECORDS UNAVAILABLE FOR
 16  5 OPERATING=WHILE=INTOXICATED VIOLATIONS.  Under current Code
 16  6 section 232.150, a court shall order juvenile court records
 16  7 to be sealed if the person who is the subject of the juvenile
 16  8 court records is 18 years of age or older and 2 years have
 16  9 elapsed since the last official action in the person's case,
 16 10 the person has not been subsequently convicted of a felony
 16 11 or an aggravated or serious misdemeanor or adjudicated a
 16 12 delinquent child for an act which if committed by an adult
 16 13 would be a felony, an aggravated misdemeanor, or a serious
 16 14 misdemeanor and no proceeding is pending seeking such
 16 15 conviction or adjudication, and the person was not placed on
 16 16 youthful offender status, transferred back to district court
 16 17 after the youthful offender's 18th birthday, and sentenced for
 16 18 the offense which precipitated the youthful offender placement.
 16 19 The bill in newly designated Code section 232.150(4) provides
 16 20 that the court shall not seal a person's juvenile court records
 16 21 if the person was adjudicated delinquent for violating Code
 16 22 section 321J.2, which prohibits the operation of a motor
 16 23 vehicle while under the influence of alcohol or a drug.
 16 24    RELEASE OF CONFIDENTIAL RECORDS.  The bill provides that a
 16 25 public record which is confidential under the provisions of
 16 26 Code chapter 232 shall only be subject to release upon order of
 16 27 a court in a proceeding under Code chapter 232.
 16 28    EXISTING CONFIDENTIALITY EXEMPTIONS.  The bill retains
 16 29 certain existing exemptions to confidentiality of juvenile
 16 30 court records. Pursuant to Code section 692A.121(8), records
 16 31 concerning sex offense convictions which are committed by
 16 32 minors may be released in the same manner as records of
 16 33 convictions of adults. Pursuant to Code section 915.10A,
 16 34 information concerning a juvenile charged with a felony offense
 16 35 may be released pursuant to an automated victim notification
 17  1 system. Under the bill, these exemptions to confidentiality
 17  2 are not amended and therefore still apply to juvenile court
 17  3 records.
 17  4    RIGHT TO COUNSEL.  The bill in Code section 232.11 provides
 17  5 that a child has the right to be represented by counsel at a
 17  6 hearing on a confidentiality order under Code section 232.149A
 17  7 or a public records order under Code section 232.149B.
 17  8    APPLICABILITY.  The bill applies to juvenile delinquency
 17  9 proceedings which are pending or arise on or after July 1,
 17 10 2016.

 11 15 alleging the commission of a delinquent act that would be a
 11 16 forcible felony if committed by an adult to be confidential
 11 17 if the court finds that the case has been dismissed and the
 11 18 person is no longer subject to the jurisdiction of the juvenile
 11 19 court and that the child's interest in making the records
 11 20 confidential outweighs the public's interest in the records
 11 21 remaining public records.
 11 22    ACCESS TO CONFIDENTIAL JUVENILE RECORDS.  The bill and
 11 23 Code section 232.147(3) provide that unless an order sealing
 11 24 confidential juvenile records has been entered, confidential
 11 25 juvenile records may still be inspected, without a court
 11 26 order, by the judge and professional court staff, including
 11 27 juvenile court officers; the child and the child's counsel;
 11 28 the child's parent, guardian or custodian, court appointed
 11 29 special advocate, and guardian ad litem, and the members of
 11 30 the child advocacy board created in Code section 237.16 or a
 11 31 local citizen foster care review board created in accordance
 11 32 with Code section 237.19 who are assigning or reviewing the
 11 33 child's case; the county attorney and the county attorney's
 11 34 assistants; an agency, association, facility, or institution
 11 35 which has custody of the child, or is legally responsible for
 12  1 the care, treatment, or supervision of the child, including
 12  2 the department of human services; a court, court professional
 12  3 staff, and adult probation officers in connection with the
 12  4 preparation of a presentence report concerning a person
 12  5 who prior thereto had been the subject of a juvenile court
 12  6 delinquency proceeding; the child's foster parent or an
 12  7 individual providing preadoptive care to the child; the state
 12  8 public defender; the department of corrections; a judicial
 12  9 district department of correctional services; the board of
 12 10 parole; the superintendent or the superintendent's designee of
 12 11 the school district for the school attended by the child or
 12 12 the authorities in charge of an accredited nonpublic school
 12 13 attended by the child; a member of the armed forces of the
 12 14 United States who is conducting a background investigation of
 12 15 an individual pursuant to federal law; the statistical analysis
 12 16 center for the purposes stated in Code section 216A.136; a
 12 17 state or local law enforcement agency; and the alleged victim
 12 18 of any delinquent act in the proceeding.
 12 19    The bill in newly designated Code section 232.147(3A)
 12 20 provides that juvenile court records containing a petition or
 12 21 complaint alleging the commission of a delinquent act that
 12 22 would be a forcible felony if committed by an adult shall be
 12 23 public records unless subject to a confidentiality order under
 12 24 Code section 232.149A or a sealing order under Code section
 12 25 232.150.  However, the bill provides that such official records
 12 26 shall not be available to the public or any governmental
 12 27 agency through the internet or in an electronic customized
 12 28 data report unless the child has been adjudicated delinquent
 12 29 in the matter.  Nevertheless, the bill provides that official
 12 30 juvenile court records may be disclosed without a court order
 12 31 through the internet or in an electronic customized data
 12 32 report prior to the child being adjudicated delinquent to the
 12 33 judge and professional court staff, including juvenile court
 12 34 officers; the child's counsel or guardian ad litem; the county
 12 35 attorney and the county attorney's assistants; a court, court
 13  1 professional staff, and adult probation officers in connection
 13  2 with the preparation of a presentence report concerning a
 13  3 person who prior thereto had been the subject of a juvenile
 13  4 court proceeding; a state or local law enforcement agency; the
 13  5 state public defender; the statistical analysis center for
 13  6 the purposes stated in Code section 216A.136; the department
 13  7 of human services; the department of corrections; a judicial
 13  8 district department of correctional services; and the board of
 13  9 parole.
 13 10    CONFIDENTIALITY OF TRANSCRIPTS.  The bill in newly
 13 11 designated Code section 232.147(3B) provides that if the court
 13 12 has excluded the public from a hearing pursuant to Code section
 13 13 232.39 or 232.92, the transcript of the proceedings shall not
 13 14 be deemed a public record and inspection and disclosure of
 13 15 the contents of the transcript shall not be permitted except
 13 16 pursuant to a court order or unless otherwise provided in Code
 13 17 chapter 232.
 13 18    USE OF ADJUDICATION OF DELINQUENCY FOR PENALTY ENHANCEMENTS
 13 19 OR EVIDENCE.  The bill in newly designated Code section
 13 20 232.147(13) provides that the confidentiality of a final
 13 21 adjudication of delinquency under Code section 232.147 or
 13 22 pursuant to Code section 232.149A shall not prohibit the state
 13 23 from pleading or proving the adjudication at a subsequent
 13 24 criminal or delinquency proceeding for the purpose of penalty
 13 25 enhancement when a provision of the Code specifically deems the
 13 26 delinquency adjudication to constitute a final conviction.
 13 27    The bill in newly designated Code section 232.147(14)
 13 28 provides that the provisions of the bill shall not be construed
 13 29 to limit or restrict the production, use, or introduction
 13 30 of official juvenile court records in any juvenile or adult
 13 31 criminal proceeding, where such records are relevant and deemed
 13 32 admissible under any other provision of the law.
 13 33    CONFIDENTIALITY OF RECORDS AND FILES OF CRIMINAL OR
 13 34 JUVENILE JUSTICE AGENCIES.  Under current law, records and
 13 35 files of a criminal or juvenile justice agency concerning
 14  1 a child involved in a delinquent act are public records,
 14  2 subject to certain exceptions. The bill in Code section
 14  3 232.149 provides that the records and files of a criminal or
 14  4 juvenile justice agency, an intake officer, or a juvenile court
 14  5 officer concerning a child involved in a delinquent act are
 14  6 confidential. The bill further provides that the records of an
 14  7 intake officer or juvenile court officer containing a dismissal
 14  8 of a complaint or an informal adjustment of a complaint when
 14  9 no petition is filed relating to the complaint, shall not be
 14 10 available to the public, but may be disclosed to the judge and
 14 11 professional court staff, including juvenile court officers;
 14 12 the child's counsel or guardian ad litem; the county attorney
 14 13 and county attorney's assistants;  the superintendent or the
 14 14 superintendent's designee of the school district for the
 14 15 school attended by the child or the authorities in charge of
 14 16 an accredited nonpublic school attended by the child; a member
 14 17 of the armed forces of the United States who is conducting a
 14 18 background investigation of an individual pursuant to federal
 14 19 law; the statistical analysis center for the purposes stated
 14 20 in Code section 216A.136; the state public defender;  the
 14 21 department of human services; and the alleged victim of the
 14 22 delinquent act.
 14 23    PUBLIC RECORDS HEARINGS.  The bill enacts new Code section
 14 24 232.149B, which provides that a person may apply for a court
 14 25 order to make confidential juvenile court records public.
 14 26 The bill provides that a rebuttable presumption exists that
 14 27 official juvenile court records shall remain confidential. The
 14 28 bill provides that the court shall order the official juvenile
 14 29 court records in such a delinquency proceeding to be public
 14 30 records if either the public's interest in making the records
 14 31 public outweighs the juvenile's interest in maintaining the
 14 32 confidentiality of the records or the juvenile has been placed
 14 33 on youthful offender status pursuant to Code section 232.45(7)
 14 34 and Code section 907.3A(1), and will be transferred back to
 14 35 the district court for sentencing prior to the child's 18th
 15  1 birthday. The court may order the official juvenile court
 15  2 records in such a delinquency proceeding to be public records
 15  3 if the juvenile has been subsequently adjudicated delinquent
 15  4 for a public offense that would be a serious misdemeanor,
 15  5 aggravated misdemeanor, or felony offense if committed by an
 15  6 adult, or another delinquency proceeding is pending seeking
 15  7 such an adjudication. The bill provides that records subject
 15  8 to a public records order may be sealed at a later date
 15  9 pursuant to Code section 232.150.
 15 10    RIGHT TO REVIEW AND RELEASE A CONFIDENTIAL COMPLAINT.  The
 15 11 bill provides that delinquency complaints shall be released
 15 12 in accordance with Code section 915.25. Under current Code
 15 13 section 915.25, a complaint which alleges that a child who is
 15 14 at least 10 years of age committed a delinquent act, which if
 15 15 committed by an adult would be a public offense, is a public
 15 16 record. Current Code section 915.25 authorizes the court,
 15 17 its designee, or law enforcement officials to release such
 15 18 a complaint, including the identity of the child. The bill
 15 19 amends Code section 915.25 to provide that such a complaint
 15 20 is confidential unless the complaint alleges that the child
 15 21 committed a delinquent act that if committed by an adult would
 15 22 be a forcible felony. However, the bill authorizes state and
 15 23 local enforcement officials to release a confidential complaint
 15 24 against a child if the child is at large and doing so is deemed
 15 25 necessary for the protection of the public or the safety of
 15 26 the child. If the complaint is not confidential because the
 15 27 alleged delinquent act is an act that would be a forcible
 15 28 felony if committed by an adult, the court, its designee,
 15 29 or law enforcement officials may release such a complaint,
 15 30 including the identity of the child.
 15 31    The bill provides that an intake or juvenile court officer
 15 32 shall disclose to the alleged victim of a delinquent act, upon
 15 33 request, the complaint, the name and address of the child who
 15 34 allegedly committed the delinquent act, and the disposition
 15 35 of the complaint. If the alleged delinquent act would be
 16  1 a forcible felony if committed by an adult, the intake or
 16  2 juvenile court officer shall provide notification to the victim
 16  3 as required by Code section 915.24.
 16  4    SEALING OF JUVENILE COURT RECORDS UNAVAILABLE FOR
 16  5 OPERATING=WHILE=INTOXICATED VIOLATIONS.  Under current Code
 16  6 section 232.150, a court shall order juvenile court records
 16  7 to be sealed if the person who is the subject of the juvenile
 16  8 court records is 18 years of age or older and 2 years have
 16  9 elapsed since the last official action in the person's case,
 16 10 the person has not been subsequently convicted of a felony
 16 11 or an aggravated or serious misdemeanor or adjudicated a
 16 12 delinquent child for an act which if committed by an adult
 16 13 would be a felony, an aggravated misdemeanor, or a serious
 16 14 misdemeanor and no proceeding is pending seeking such
 16 15 conviction or adjudication, and the person was not placed on
 16 16 youthful offender status, transferred back to district court
 16 17 after the youthful offender's 18th birthday, and sentenced for
 16 18 the offense which precipitated the youthful offender placement.
 16 19 The bill in newly designated Code section 232.150(4) provides
 16 20 that the court shall not seal a person's juvenile court records
 16 21 if the person was adjudicated delinquent for violating Code
 16 22 section 321J.2, which prohibits the operation of a motor
 16 23 vehicle while under the influence of alcohol or a drug.
 16 24    RELEASE OF CONFIDENTIAL RECORDS.  The bill provides that a
 16 25 public record which is confidential under the provisions of
 16 26 Code chapter 232 shall only be subject to release upon order of
 16 27 a court in a proceeding under Code chapter 232.
 16 28    EXISTING CONFIDENTIALITY EXEMPTIONS.  The bill retains
 16 29 certain existing exemptions to confidentiality of juvenile
 16 30 court records. Pursuant to Code section 692A.121(8), records
 16 31 concerning sex offense convictions which are committed by
 16 32 minors may be released in the same manner as records of
 16 33 convictions of adults. Pursuant to Code section 915.10A,
 16 34 information concerning a juvenile charged with a felony offense
 16 35 may be released pursuant to an automated victim notification
 17  1 system. Under the bill, these exemptions to confidentiality
 17  2 are not amended and therefore still apply to juvenile court
 17  3 records.
 17  4    RIGHT TO COUNSEL.  The bill in Code section 232.11 provides
 17  5 that a child has the right to be represented by counsel at a
 17  6 hearing on a confidentiality order under Code section 232.149A
 17  7 or a public records order under Code section 232.149B.

 12 16 center for the purposes stated in Code section 216A.136; a
 12 17 state or local law enforcement agency; and the alleged victim
 12 18 of any delinquent act in the proceeding.
 12 19    The bill in newly designated Code section 232.147(3A)
 12 20 provides that juvenile court records containing a petition or
 12 21 complaint alleging the commission of a delinquent act that
 12 22 would be a forcible felony if committed by an adult shall be
 12 23 public records unless subject to a confidentiality order under
 12 24 Code section 232.149A or a sealing order under Code section

 12 29 in the matter.  Nevertheless, the bill provides that official
 12 30 juvenile court records may be disclosed without a court order
 12 31 through the internet or in an electronic customized data
 12 32 report prior to the child being adjudicated delinquent to the
 12 33 judge and professional court staff, including juvenile court

 13 10    CONFIDENTIALITY OF TRANSCRIPTS.  The bill in newly

 13 18    USE OF ADJUDICATION OF DELINQUENCY FOR PENALTY ENHANCEMENTS
 13 19 OR EVIDENCE.  The bill in newly designated Code section
 13 20 232.147(13) provides that the confidentiality of a final
 13 21 adjudication of delinquency under Code section 232.147 or
 13 22 pursuant to Code section 232.149A shall not prohibit the state
 13 23 from pleading or proving the adjudication at a subsequent
 13 24 criminal or delinquency proceeding for the purpose of penalty
 13 25 enhancement when a provision of the Code specifically deems the
 13 26 delinquency adjudication to constitute a final conviction.
 13 27    The bill in newly designated Code section 232.147(14)
 13 28 provides that the provisions of the bill shall not be construed
 13 29 to limit or restrict the production, use, or introduction
 13 30 of official juvenile court records in any juvenile or adult
 13 31 criminal proceeding, where such records are relevant and deemed
 13 32 admissible under any other provision of the law.
 13 33    CONFIDENTIALITY OF RECORDS AND FILES OF CRIMINAL OR
 13 34 JUVENILE JUSTICE AGENCIES.  Under current law, records and
 13 35 files of a criminal or juvenile justice agency concerning
 14  1 a child involved in a delinquent act are public records,
 14  2 subject to certain exceptions. The bill in Code section
 14  3 232.149 provides that the records and files of a criminal or
 14  4 juvenile justice agency, an intake officer, or a juvenile court
 14  5 officer concerning a child involved in a delinquent act are
 14  6 confidential. The bill further provides that the records of an
 14  7 intake officer or juvenile court officer containing a dismissal
 14  8 of a complaint or an informal adjustment of a complaint when
 14  9 no petition is filed relating to the complaint, shall not be
 14 10 available to the public, but may be disclosed to the judge and
 14 11 professional court staff, including juvenile court officers;
 14 12 the child's counsel or guardian ad litem; the county attorney
 14 13 and county attorney's assistants;  the superintendent or the
 14 14 superintendent's designee of the school district for the
 14 15 school attended by the child or the authorities in charge of
 14 16 an accredited nonpublic school attended by the child; a member
 14 17 of the armed forces of the United States who is conducting a
 14 18 background investigation of an individual pursuant to federal
 14 19 law; the statistical analysis center for the purposes stated
 14 20 in Code section 216A.136; the state public defender;  the
 14 21 department of human services; and the alleged victim of the
 14 22 delinquent act.
 14 23    PUBLIC RECORDS HEARINGS.  The bill enacts new Code section
 14 24 232.149B, which provides that a person may apply for a court
 14 25 order to make confidential juvenile court records public.
 14 26 The bill provides that a rebuttable presumption exists that
 14 27 official juvenile court records shall remain confidential. The
 14 28 bill provides that the court shall order the official juvenile
 14 29 court records in such a delinquency proceeding to be public
 14 30 records if either the public's interest in making the records
 14 31 public outweighs the juvenile's interest in maintaining the
 14 32 confidentiality of the records or the juvenile has been placed
 14 33 on youthful offender status pursuant to Code section 232.45(7)
 14 34 and Code section 907.3A(1), and will be transferred back to
 14 35 the district court for sentencing prior to the child's 18th
 15  1 birthday. The court may order the official juvenile court
 15  2 records in such a delinquency proceeding to be public records
 15  3 if the juvenile has been subsequently adjudicated delinquent
 15  4 for a public offense that would be a serious misdemeanor,
 15  5 aggravated misdemeanor, or felony offense if committed by an
 15  6 adult, or another delinquency proceeding is pending seeking
 15  7 such an adjudication. The bill provides that records subject
 15  8 to a public records order may be sealed at a later date
 15  9 pursuant to Code section 232.150.
 15 10    RIGHT TO REVIEW AND RELEASE A CONFIDENTIAL COMPLAINT.  The
 15 11 bill provides that delinquency complaints shall be released
 15 12 in accordance with Code section 915.25. Under current Code
 15 13 section 915.25, a complaint which alleges that a child who is
 15 14 at least 10 years of age committed a delinquent act, which if
 15 15 committed by an adult would be a public offense, is a public
 15 16 record. Current Code section 915.25 authorizes the court,
 15 17 its designee, or law enforcement officials to release such
 15 18 a complaint, including the identity of the child. The bill
 15 19 amends Code section 915.25 to provide that such a complaint
 15 20 is confidential unless the complaint alleges that the child
 15 21 committed a delinquent act that if committed by an adult would
 15 22 be a forcible felony. However, the bill authorizes state and
 15 23 local enforcement officials to release a confidential complaint
 15 24 against a child if the child is at large and doing so is deemed
 15 25 necessary for the protection of the public or the safety of
 15 26 the child. If the complaint is not confidential because the
 15 27 alleged delinquent act is an act that would be a forcible
 15 28 felony if committed by an adult, the court, its designee,
 15 29 or law enforcement officials may release such a complaint,
 15 30 including the identity of the child.
 15 31    The bill provides that an intake or juvenile court officer
 15 32 shall disclose to the alleged victim of a delinquent act, upon
 15 33 request, the complaint, the name and address of the child who
 15 34 allegedly committed the delinquent act, and the disposition
 15 35 of the complaint. If the alleged delinquent act would be
 16  1 a forcible felony if committed by an adult, the intake or
 16  2 juvenile court officer shall provide notification to the victim
 16  3 as required by Code section 915.24.
 16  4    SEALING OF JUVENILE COURT RECORDS UNAVAILABLE FOR
 16  5 OPERATING=WHILE=INTOXICATED VIOLATIONS.  Under current Code
 16  6 section 232.150, a court shall order juvenile court records
 16  7 to be sealed if the person who is the subject of the juvenile
 16  8 court records is 18 years of age or older and 2 years have
 16  9 elapsed since the last official action in the person's case,
 16 10 the person has not been subsequently convicted of a felony
 16 11 or an aggravated or serious misdemeanor or adjudicated a
 16 12 delinquent child for an act which if committed by an adult
 16 13 would be a felony, an aggravated misdemeanor, or a serious
 16 14 misdemeanor and no proceeding is pending seeking such
 16 15 conviction or adjudication, and the person was not placed on
 16 16 youthful offender status, transferred back to district court
 16 17 after the youthful offender's 18th birthday, and sentenced for
 16 18 the offense which precipitated the youthful offender placement.
 16 19 The bill in newly designated Code section 232.150(4) provides
 16 20 that the court shall not seal a person's juvenile court records
 16 21 if the person was adjudicated delinquent for violating Code
 16 22 section 321J.2, which prohibits the operation of a motor
 16 23 vehicle while under the influence of alcohol or a drug.
 16 24    RELEASE OF CONFIDENTIAL RECORDS.  The bill provides that a
 16 25 public record which is confidential under the provisions of
 16 26 Code chapter 232 shall only be subject to release upon order of
 16 27 a court in a proceeding under Code chapter 232.
 16 28    EXISTING CONFIDENTIALITY EXEMPTIONS.  The bill retains
 16 29 certain existing exemptions to confidentiality of juvenile
 16 30 court records. Pursuant to Code section 692A.121(8), records
 16 31 concerning sex offense convictions which are committed by
 16 32 minors may be released in the same manner as records of
 16 33 convictions of adults. Pursuant to Code section 915.10A,
 16 34 information concerning a juvenile charged with a felony offense
 16 35 may be released pursuant to an automated victim notification
 17  1 system. Under the bill, these exemptions to confidentiality
 17  2 are not amended and therefore still apply to juvenile court
 17  3 records.
 17  4    RIGHT TO COUNSEL.  The bill in Code section 232.11 provides
 17  5 that a child has the right to be represented by counsel at a
 17  6 hearing on a confidentiality order under Code section 232.149A
 17  7 or a public records order under Code section 232.149B.
 17  8    APPLICABILITY.  The bill applies to juvenile delinquency
 17  9 proceedings which are pending or arise on or after July 1,
 17 10 2016.

 11 17 if the court finds that the case has been dismissed and the
 11 18 person is no longer subject to the jurisdiction of the juvenile
 11 19 court and that the child's interest in making the records
 11 20 confidential outweighs the public's interest in the records
 11 21 remaining public records.
 11 22    ACCESS TO CONFIDENTIAL JUVENILE RECORDS.  The bill and
 11 23 Code section 232.147(3) provide that unless an order sealing
 11 24 confidential juvenile records has been entered, confidential
 11 25 juvenile records may still be inspected, without a court
 11 26 order, by the judge and professional court staff, including
 11 27 juvenile court officers; the child and the child's counsel;
 11 28 the child's parent, guardian or custodian, court appointed
 11 29 special advocate, and guardian ad litem, and the members of
 11 30 the child advocacy board created in Code section 237.16 or a
 11 31 local citizen foster care review board created in accordance
 11 32 with Code section 237.19 who are assigning or reviewing the
 11 33 child's case; the county attorney and the county attorney's
 11 34 assistants; an agency, association, facility, or institution
 11 35 which has custody of the child, or is legally responsible for
 12  1 the care, treatment, or supervision of the child, including
 12  2 the department of human services; a court, court professional
 12  3 staff, and adult probation officers in connection with the
 12  4 preparation of a presentence report concerning a person
 12  5 who prior thereto had been the subject of a juvenile court
 12  6 delinquency proceeding; the child's foster parent or an
 12  7 individual providing preadoptive care to the child; the state
 12  8 public defender; the department of corrections; a judicial
 12  9 district department of correctional services; the board of
 12 10 parole; the superintendent or the superintendent's designee of
 12 11 the school district for the school attended by the child or
 12 12 the authorities in charge of an accredited nonpublic school
 12 13 attended by the child; a member of the armed forces of the
 12 14 United States who is conducting a background investigation of
 12 15 an individual pursuant to federal law; the statistical analysis
 12 16 center for the purposes stated in Code section 216A.136; a
 12 17 state or local law enforcement agency; and the alleged victim
 12 18 of any delinquent act in the proceeding.
 12 19    The bill in newly designated Code section 232.147(3A)
 12 20 provides that juvenile court records containing a petition or
 12 21 complaint alleging the commission of a delinquent act that
 12 22 would be a forcible felony if committed by an adult shall be
 12 23 public records unless subject to a confidentiality order under
 12 24 Code section 232.149A or a sealing order under Code section
 12 25 232.150.  However, the bill provides that such official records
 12 26 shall not be available to the public or any governmental
 12 27 agency through the internet or in an electronic customized
 12 28 data report unless the child has been adjudicated delinquent
 12 29 in the matter.  Nevertheless, the bill provides that official
 12 30 juvenile court records may be disclosed without a court order
 12 31 through the internet or in an electronic customized data
 12 32 report prior to the child being adjudicated delinquent to the
 12 33 judge and professional court staff, including juvenile court
 12 34 officers; the child's counsel or guardian ad litem; the county
 12 35 attorney and the county attorney's assistants; a court, court
 13  1 professional staff, and adult probation officers in connection
 13  2 with the preparation of a presentence report concerning a
 13  3 person who prior thereto had been the subject of a juvenile
 13  4 court proceeding; a state or local law enforcement agency; the
 13  5 state public defender; the statistical analysis center for
 13  6 the purposes stated in Code section 216A.136; the department
 13  7 of human services; the department of corrections; a judicial
 13  8 district department of correctional services; and the board of
 13  9 parole.
 13 10    CONFIDENTIALITY OF TRANSCRIPTS.  The bill in newly
 13 11 designated Code section 232.147(3B) provides that if the court
 13 12 has excluded the public from a hearing pursuant to Code section
 13 13 232.39 or 232.92, the transcript of the proceedings shall not
 13 14 be deemed a public record and inspection and disclosure of
 13 15 the contents of the transcript shall not be permitted except
 13 16 pursuant to a court order or unless otherwise provided in Code
 13 17 chapter 232.
 13 18    USE OF ADJUDICATION OF DELINQUENCY FOR PENALTY ENHANCEMENTS
 13 19 OR EVIDENCE.  The bill in newly designated Code section
 13 20 232.147(13) provides that the confidentiality of a final
 13 21 adjudication of delinquency under Code section 232.147 or
 13 22 pursuant to Code section 232.149A shall not prohibit the state
 13 23 from pleading or proving the adjudication at a subsequent
 13 24 criminal or delinquency proceeding for the purpose of penalty
 13 25 enhancement when a provision of the Code specifically deems the
 13 26 delinquency adjudication to constitute a final conviction.
 13 27    The bill in newly designated Code section 232.147(14)
 13 28 provides that the provisions of the bill shall not be construed
 13 29 to limit or restrict the production, use, or introduction
 13 30 of official juvenile court records in any juvenile or adult
 13 31 criminal proceeding, where such records are relevant and deemed
 13 32 admissible under any other provision of the law.
 13 33    CONFIDENTIALITY OF RECORDS AND FILES OF CRIMINAL OR
 13 34 JUVENILE JUSTICE AGENCIES.  Under current law, records and
 13 35 files of a criminal or juvenile justice agency concerning
 14  1 a child involved in a delinquent act are public records,
 14  2 subject to certain exceptions. The bill in Code section
 14  3 232.149 provides that the records and files of a criminal or
 14  4 juvenile justice agency, an intake officer, or a juvenile court
 14  5 officer concerning a child involved in a delinquent act are
 14  6 confidential. The bill further provides that the records of an
 14  7 intake officer or juvenile court officer containing a dismissal
 14  8 of a complaint or an informal adjustment of a complaint when
 14  9 no petition is filed relating to the complaint, shall not be
 14 10 available to the public, but may be disclosed to the judge and

 14 19 law; the statistical analysis center for the purposes stated
 14 20 in Code section 216A.136; the state public defender;  the
 14 21 department of human services; and the alleged victim of the
 14 22 delinquent act.
 14 23    PUBLIC RECORDS HEARINGS.  The bill enacts new Code section

 14 25 order to make confidential juvenile court records public.
 14 26 The bill provides that a rebuttable presumption exists that
 14 27 official juvenile court records shall remain confidential. The
 14 28 bill provides that the court shall order the official juvenile
 14 29 court records in such a delinquency proceeding to be public
 14 30 records if either the public's interest in making the records
 14 31 public outweighs the juvenile's interest in maintaining the
 14 32 confidentiality of the records or the juvenile has been placed
 14 33 on youthful offender status pursuant to Code section 232.45(7)
 14 34 and Code section 907.3A(1), and will be transferred back to
 14 35 the district court for sentencing prior to the child's 18th
 15  1 birthday. The court may order the official juvenile court
 15  2 records in such a delinquency proceeding to be public records
 15  3 if the juvenile has been subsequently adjudicated delinquent
 15  4 for a public offense that would be a serious misdemeanor,
 15  5 aggravated misdemeanor, or felony offense if committed by an
 15  6 adult, or another delinquency proceeding is pending seeking
 15  7 such an adjudication. The bill provides that records subject

 15  9 pursuant to Code section 232.150.
 15 10    RIGHT TO REVIEW AND RELEASE A CONFIDENTIAL COMPLAINT.  The
 15 11 bill provides that delinquency complaints shall be released
 15 12 in accordance with Code section 915.25. Under current Code
 15 13 section 915.25, a complaint which alleges that a child who is
 15 14 at least 10 years of age committed a delinquent act, which if
 15 15 committed by an adult would be a public offense, is a public
 15 16 record. Current Code section 915.25 authorizes the court,
 15 17 its designee, or law enforcement officials to release such
 15 18 a complaint, including the identity of the child. The bill
 15 19 amends Code section 915.25 to provide that such a complaint
 15 20 is confidential unless the complaint alleges that the child
 15 21 committed a delinquent act that if committed by an adult would
 15 22 be a forcible felony. However, the bill authorizes state and

 15 31    The bill provides that an intake or juvenile court officer

 14  3 232.149 provides that the records and files of a criminal or
 14  4 juvenile justice agency, an intake officer, or a juvenile court
 14  5 officer concerning a child involved in a delinquent act are
 14  6 confidential. The bill further provides that the records of an
 14  7 intake officer or juvenile court officer containing a dismissal
 14  8 of a complaint or an informal adjustment of a complaint when
 14  9 no petition is filed relating to the complaint, shall not be
 14 10 available to the public, but may be disclosed to the judge and
 14 11 professional court staff, including juvenile court officers;
 14 12 the child's counsel or guardian ad litem; the county attorney
 14 13 and county attorney's assistants;  the superintendent or the
 14 14 superintendent's designee of the school district for the
 14 15 school attended by the child or the authorities in charge of
 14 16 an accredited nonpublic school attended by the child; a member
 14 17 of the armed forces of the United States who is conducting a
 14 18 background investigation of an individual pursuant to federal
 14 19 law; the statistical analysis center for the purposes stated
 14 20 in Code section 216A.136; the state public defender;  the
 14 21 department of human services; and the alleged victim of the
 14 22 delinquent act.
 14 23    PUBLIC RECORDS HEARINGS.  The bill enacts new Code section
 14 24 232.149B, which provides that a person may apply for a court
 14 25 order to make confidential juvenile court records public.
 14 26 The bill provides that a rebuttable presumption exists that
 14 27 official juvenile court records shall remain confidential. The
 14 28 bill provides that the court shall order the official juvenile
 14 29 court records in such a delinquency proceeding to be public
 14 30 records if either the public's interest in making the records
 14 31 public outweighs the juvenile's interest in maintaining the
 14 32 confidentiality of the records or the juvenile has been placed
 14 33 on youthful offender status pursuant to Code section 232.45(7)
 14 34 and Code section 907.3A(1), and will be transferred back to
 14 35 the district court for sentencing prior to the child's 18th
 15  1 birthday. The court may order the official juvenile court
 15  2 records in such a delinquency proceeding to be public records
 15  3 if the juvenile has been subsequently adjudicated delinquent
 15  4 for a public offense that would be a serious misdemeanor,
 15  5 aggravated misdemeanor, or felony offense if committed by an
 15  6 adult, or another delinquency proceeding is pending seeking
 15  7 such an adjudication. The bill provides that records subject
 15  8 to a public records order may be sealed at a later date
 15  9 pursuant to Code section 232.150.
 15 10    RIGHT TO REVIEW AND RELEASE A CONFIDENTIAL COMPLAINT.  The
 15 11 bill provides that delinquency complaints shall be released
 15 12 in accordance with Code section 915.25. Under current Code
 15 13 section 915.25, a complaint which alleges that a child who is
 15 14 at least 10 years of age committed a delinquent act, which if
 15 15 committed by an adult would be a public offense, is a public
 15 16 record. Current Code section 915.25 authorizes the court,
 15 17 its designee, or law enforcement officials to release such
 15 18 a complaint, including the identity of the child. The bill
 15 19 amends Code section 915.25 to provide that such a complaint
 15 20 is confidential unless the complaint alleges that the child
 15 21 committed a delinquent act that if committed by an adult would
 15 22 be a forcible felony. However, the bill authorizes state and
 15 23 local enforcement officials to release a confidential complaint
 15 24 against a child if the child is at large and doing so is deemed
 15 25 necessary for the protection of the public or the safety of
 15 26 the child. If the complaint is not confidential because the
 15 27 alleged delinquent act is an act that would be a forcible
 15 28 felony if committed by an adult, the court, its designee,
 15 29 or law enforcement officials may release such a complaint,
 15 30 including the identity of the child.
 15 31    The bill provides that an intake or juvenile court officer
 15 32 shall disclose to the alleged victim of a delinquent act, upon
 15 33 request, the complaint, the name and address of the child who
 15 34 allegedly committed the delinquent act, and the disposition
 15 35 of the complaint. If the alleged delinquent act would be
 16  1 a forcible felony if committed by an adult, the intake or
 16  2 juvenile court officer shall provide notification to the victim
 16  3 as required by Code section 915.24.
 16  4    SEALING OF JUVENILE COURT RECORDS UNAVAILABLE FOR
 16  5 OPERATING=WHILE=INTOXICATED VIOLATIONS.  Under current Code
 16  6 section 232.150, a court shall order juvenile court records
 16  7 to be sealed if the person who is the subject of the juvenile
 16  8 court records is 18 years of age or older and 2 years have
 16  9 elapsed since the last official action in the person's case,
 16 10 the person has not been subsequently convicted of a felony
 16 11 or an aggravated or serious misdemeanor or adjudicated a
 16 12 delinquent child for an act which if committed by an adult
 16 13 would be a felony, an aggravated misdemeanor, or a serious
 16 14 misdemeanor and no proceeding is pending seeking such
 16 15 conviction or adjudication, and the person was not placed on
 16 16 youthful offender status, transferred back to district court
 16 17 after the youthful offender's 18th birthday, and sentenced for
 16 18 the offense which precipitated the youthful offender placement.
 16 19 The bill in newly designated Code section 232.150(4) provides
 16 20 that the court shall not seal a person's juvenile court records
 16 21 if the person was adjudicated delinquent for violating Code
 16 22 section 321J.2, which prohibits the operation of a motor
 16 23 vehicle while under the influence of alcohol or a drug.
 16 24    RELEASE OF CONFIDENTIAL RECORDS.  The bill provides that a
 16 25 public record which is confidential under the provisions of
 16 26 Code chapter 232 shall only be subject to release upon order of
 16 27 a court in a proceeding under Code chapter 232.
 16 28    EXISTING CONFIDENTIALITY EXEMPTIONS.  The bill retains
 16 29 certain existing exemptions to confidentiality of juvenile
 16 30 court records. Pursuant to Code section 692A.121(8), records
 16 31 concerning sex offense convictions which are committed by
 16 32 minors may be released in the same manner as records of
 16 33 convictions of adults. Pursuant to Code section 915.10A,
 16 34 information concerning a juvenile charged with a felony offense
 16 35 may be released pursuant to an automated victim notification
 17  1 system. Under the bill, these exemptions to confidentiality
 17  2 are not amended and therefore still apply to juvenile court
 17  3 records.
 17  4    RIGHT TO COUNSEL.  The bill in Code section 232.11 provides
 17  5 that a child has the right to be represented by counsel at a
 17  6 hearing on a confidentiality order under Code section 232.149A
 17  7 or a public records order under Code section 232.149B.
 17  8    APPLICABILITY.  The bill applies to juvenile delinquency
 17  9 proceedings which are pending or arise on or after July 1,
 17 10 2016.

 11 20 confidential outweighs the public's interest in the records
 11 21 remaining public records.
 11 22    ACCESS TO CONFIDENTIAL JUVENILE RECORDS.  The bill and
 11 23 Code section 232.147(3) provide that unless an order sealing
 11 24 confidential juvenile records has been entered, confidential
 11 25 juvenile records may still be inspected, without a court
 11 26 order, by the judge and professional court staff, including
 11 27 juvenile court officers; the child and the child's counsel;
 11 28 the child's parent, guardian or custodian, court appointed
 11 29 special advocate, and guardian ad litem, and the members of
 11 30 the child advocacy board created in Code section 237.16 or a
 11 31 local citizen foster care review board created in accordance
 11 32 with Code section 237.19 who are assigning or reviewing the
 11 33 child's case; the county attorney and the county attorney's
 11 34 assistants; an agency, association, facility, or institution
 11 35 which has custody of the child, or is legally responsible for
 12  1 the care, treatment, or supervision of the child, including
 12  2 the department of human services; a court, court professional
 12  3 staff, and adult probation officers in connection with the
 12  4 preparation of a presentence report concerning a person
 12  5 who prior thereto had been the subject of a juvenile court
 12  6 delinquency proceeding; the child's foster parent or an
 12  7 individual providing preadoptive care to the child; the state
 12  8 public defender; the department of corrections; a judicial
 12  9 district department of correctional services; the board of
 12 10 parole; the superintendent or the superintendent's designee of
 12 11 the school district for the school attended by the child or
 12 12 the authorities in charge of an accredited nonpublic school
 12 13 attended by the child; a member of the armed forces of the
 12 14 United States who is conducting a background investigation of
 12 15 an individual pursuant to federal law; the statistical analysis
 12 16 center for the purposes stated in Code section 216A.136; a
 12 17 state or local law enforcement agency; and the alleged victim
 12 18 of any delinquent act in the proceeding.
 12 19    The bill in newly designated Code section 232.147(3A)
 12 20 provides that juvenile court records containing a petition or
 12 21 complaint alleging the commission of a delinquent act that
 12 22 would be a forcible felony if committed by an adult shall be
 12 23 public records unless subject to a confidentiality order under
 12 24 Code section 232.149A or a sealing order under Code section
 12 25 232.150.  However, the bill provides that such official records
 12 26 shall not be available to the public or any governmental
 12 27 agency through the internet or in an electronic customized
 12 28 data report unless the child has been adjudicated delinquent
 12 29 in the matter.  Nevertheless, the bill provides that official
 12 30 juvenile court records may be disclosed without a court order
 12 31 through the internet or in an electronic customized data
 12 32 report prior to the child being adjudicated delinquent to the
 12 33 judge and professional court staff, including juvenile court
 12 34 officers; the child's counsel or guardian ad litem; the county
 12 35 attorney and the county attorney's assistants; a court, court
 13  1 professional staff, and adult probation officers in connection
 13  2 with the preparation of a presentence report concerning a
 13  3 person who prior thereto had been the subject of a juvenile
 13  4 court proceeding; a state or local law enforcement agency; the
 13  5 state public defender; the statistical analysis center for
 13  6 the purposes stated in Code section 216A.136; the department
 13  7 of human services; the department of corrections; a judicial
 13  8 district department of correctional services; and the board of
 13  9 parole.
 13 10    CONFIDENTIALITY OF TRANSCRIPTS.  The bill in newly
 13 11 designated Code section 232.147(3B) provides that if the court
 13 12 has excluded the public from a hearing pursuant to Code section
 13 13 232.39 or 232.92, the transcript of the proceedings shall not
 13 14 be deemed a public record and inspection and disclosure of
 13 15 the contents of the transcript shall not be permitted except
 13 16 pursuant to a court order or unless otherwise provided in Code
 13 17 chapter 232.
 13 18    USE OF ADJUDICATION OF DELINQUENCY FOR PENALTY ENHANCEMENTS
 13 19 OR EVIDENCE.  The bill in newly designated Code section
 13 20 232.147(13) provides that the confidentiality of a final
 13 21 adjudication of delinquency under Code section 232.147 or
 13 22 pursuant to Code section 232.149A shall not prohibit the state
 13 23 from pleading or proving the adjudication at a subsequent
 13 24 criminal or delinquency proceeding for the purpose of penalty
 13 25 enhancement when a provision of the Code specifically deems the
 13 26 delinquency adjudication to constitute a final conviction.
 13 27    The bill in newly designated Code section 232.147(14)
 13 28 provides that the provisions of the bill shall not be construed
 13 29 to limit or restrict the production, use, or introduction
 13 30 of official juvenile court records in any juvenile or adult
 13 31 criminal proceeding, where such records are relevant and deemed
 13 32 admissible under any other provision of the law.
 13 33    CONFIDENTIALITY OF RECORDS AND FILES OF CRIMINAL OR
 13 34 JUVENILE JUSTICE AGENCIES.  Under current law, records and
 13 35 files of a criminal or juvenile justice agency concerning
 14  1 a child involved in a delinquent act are public records,
 14  2 subject to certain exceptions. The bill in Code section
 14  3 232.149 provides that the records and files of a criminal or
 14  4 juvenile justice agency, an intake officer, or a juvenile court
 14  5 officer concerning a child involved in a delinquent act are
 14  6 confidential. The bill further provides that the records of an
 14  7 intake officer or juvenile court officer containing a dismissal
 14  8 of a complaint or an informal adjustment of a complaint when
 14  9 no petition is filed relating to the complaint, shall not be
 14 10 available to the public, but may be disclosed to the judge and
 14 11 professional court staff, including juvenile court officers;
 14 12 the child's counsel or guardian ad litem; the county attorney
 14 13 and county attorney's assistants;  the superintendent or the
 14 14 superintendent's designee of the school district for the

 14 19 law; the statistical analysis center for the purposes stated
 14 20 in Code section 216A.136; the state public defender;  the
 14 21 department of human services; and the alleged victim of the
 14 22 delinquent act.
 14 23    PUBLIC RECORDS HEARINGS.  The bill enacts new Code section
 14 24 232.149B, which provides that a person may apply for a court
 14 25 order to make confidential juvenile court records public.
 14 26 The bill provides that a rebuttable presumption exists that
 14 27 official juvenile court records shall remain confidential. The
 14 28 bill provides that the court shall order the official juvenile
 14 29 court records in such a delinquency proceeding to be public
 14 30 records if either the public's interest in making the records
 14 31 public outweighs the juvenile's interest in maintaining the
 14 32 confidentiality of the records or the juvenile has been placed
 14 33 on youthful offender status pursuant to Code section 232.45(7)
 14 34 and Code section 907.3A(1), and will be transferred back to
 14 35 the district court for sentencing prior to the child's 18th
 15  1 birthday. The court may order the official juvenile court
 15  2 records in such a delinquency proceeding to be public records
 15  3 if the juvenile has been subsequently adjudicated delinquent
 15  4 for a public offense that would be a serious misdemeanor,
 15  5 aggravated misdemeanor, or felony offense if committed by an
 15  6 adult, or another delinquency proceeding is pending seeking
 15  7 such an adjudication. The bill provides that records subject
 15  8 to a public records order may be sealed at a later date
 15  9 pursuant to Code section 232.150.
 15 10    RIGHT TO REVIEW AND RELEASE A CONFIDENTIAL COMPLAINT.  The
 15 11 bill provides that delinquency complaints shall be released
 15 12 in accordance with Code section 915.25. Under current Code
 15 13 section 915.25, a complaint which alleges that a child who is
 15 14 at least 10 years of age committed a delinquent act, which if
 15 15 committed by an adult would be a public offense, is a public
 15 16 record. Current Code section 915.25 authorizes the court,
 15 17 its designee, or law enforcement officials to release such
 15 18 a complaint, including the identity of the child. The bill
 15 19 amends Code section 915.25 to provide that such a complaint
 15 20 is confidential unless the complaint alleges that the child
 15 21 committed a delinquent act that if committed by an adult would
 15 22 be a forcible felony. However, the bill authorizes state and
 15 23 local enforcement officials to release a confidential complaint
 15 24 against a child if the child is at large and doing so is deemed
 15 25 necessary for the protection of the public or the safety of
 15 26 the child. If the complaint is not confidential because the
 15 27 alleged delinquent act is an act that would be a forcible
 15 28 felony if committed by an adult, the court, its designee,
 15 29 or law enforcement officials may release such a complaint,
 15 30 including the identity of the child.
 15 31    The bill provides that an intake or juvenile court officer
 15 32 shall disclose to the alleged victim of a delinquent act, upon
 15 33 request, the complaint, the name and address of the child who
 15 34 allegedly committed the delinquent act, and the disposition
 15 35 of the complaint. If the alleged delinquent act would be
 16  1 a forcible felony if committed by an adult, the intake or
 16  2 juvenile court officer shall provide notification to the victim
 16  3 as required by Code section 915.24.
 16  4    SEALING OF JUVENILE COURT RECORDS UNAVAILABLE FOR
 16  5 OPERATING=WHILE=INTOXICATED VIOLATIONS.  Under current Code
 16  6 section 232.150, a court shall order juvenile court records
 16  7 to be sealed if the person who is the subject of the juvenile
 16  8 court records is 18 years of age or older and 2 years have
 16  9 elapsed since the last official action in the person's case,
 16 10 the person has not been subsequently convicted of a felony
 16 11 or an aggravated or serious misdemeanor or adjudicated a
 16 12 delinquent child for an act which if committed by an adult
 16 13 would be a felony, an aggravated misdemeanor, or a serious
 16 14 misdemeanor and no proceeding is pending seeking such
 16 15 conviction or adjudication, and the person was not placed on
 16 16 youthful offender status, transferred back to district court
 16 17 after the youthful offender's 18th birthday, and sentenced for
 16 18 the offense which precipitated the youthful offender placement.
 16 19 The bill in newly designated Code section 232.150(4) provides
 16 20 that the court shall not seal a person's juvenile court records
 16 21 if the person was adjudicated delinquent for violating Code
 16 22 section 321J.2, which prohibits the operation of a motor
 16 23 vehicle while under the influence of alcohol or a drug.
 16 24    RELEASE OF CONFIDENTIAL RECORDS.  The bill provides that a
 16 25 public record which is confidential under the provisions of
 16 26 Code chapter 232 shall only be subject to release upon order of
 16 27 a court in a proceeding under Code chapter 232.
 16 28    EXISTING CONFIDENTIALITY EXEMPTIONS.  The bill retains
 16 29 certain existing exemptions to confidentiality of juvenile
 16 30 court records. Pursuant to Code section 692A.121(8), records
 16 31 concerning sex offense convictions which are committed by
 16 32 minors may be released in the same manner as records of

 11 25 juvenile records may still be inspected, without a court
 11 26 order, by the judge and professional court staff, including

 12 18 of any delinquent act in the proceeding.
 12 19    The bill in newly designated Code section 232.147(3A)
 12 20 provides that juvenile court records containing a petition or
 12 21 complaint alleging the commission of a delinquent act that
 12 22 would be a forcible felony if committed by an adult shall be
 12 23 public records unless subject to a confidentiality order under
 12 24 Code section 232.149A or a sealing order under Code section

 13 18    USE OF ADJUDICATION OF DELINQUENCY FOR PENALTY ENHANCEMENTS
 13 19 OR EVIDENCE.  The bill in newly designated Code section

 13 21 adjudication of delinquency under Code section 232.147 or
 13 22 pursuant to Code section 232.149A shall not prohibit the state
 13 23 from pleading or proving the adjudication at a subsequent

 13 33    CONFIDENTIALITY OF RECORDS AND FILES OF CRIMINAL OR
 13 34 JUVENILE JUSTICE AGENCIES.  Under current law, records and
 13 35 files of a criminal or juvenile justice agency concerning
 14  1 a child involved in a delinquent act are public records,
 14  2 subject to certain exceptions. The bill in Code section
 14  3 232.149 provides that the records and files of a criminal or
 14  4 juvenile justice agency, an intake officer, or a juvenile court
 14  5 officer concerning a child involved in a delinquent act are
 14  6 confidential. The bill further provides that the records of an
 14  7 intake officer or juvenile court officer containing a dismissal
 14  8 of a complaint or an informal adjustment of a complaint when
 14  9 no petition is filed relating to the complaint, shall not be
 14 10 available to the public, but may be disclosed to the judge and
 14 11 professional court staff, including juvenile court officers;
 14 12 the child's counsel or guardian ad litem; the county attorney
 14 13 and county attorney's assistants;  the superintendent or the
 14 14 superintendent's designee of the school district for the
 14 15 school attended by the child or the authorities in charge of
 14 16 an accredited nonpublic school attended by the child; a member
 14 17 of the armed forces of the United States who is conducting a
 14 18 background investigation of an individual pursuant to federal
 14 19 law; the statistical analysis center for the purposes stated
 14 20 in Code section 216A.136; the state public defender;  the
 14 21 department of human services; and the alleged victim of the
 14 22 delinquent act.
 14 23    PUBLIC RECORDS HEARINGS.  The bill enacts new Code section
 14 24 232.149B, which provides that a person may apply for a court
 14 25 order to make confidential juvenile court records public.
 14 26 The bill provides that a rebuttable presumption exists that
 14 27 official juvenile court records shall remain confidential. The
 14 28 bill provides that the court shall order the official juvenile
 14 29 court records in such a delinquency proceeding to be public
 14 30 records if either the public's interest in making the records
 14 31 public outweighs the juvenile's interest in maintaining the
 14 32 confidentiality of the records or the juvenile has been placed
 14 33 on youthful offender status pursuant to Code section 232.45(7)
 14 34 and Code section 907.3A(1), and will be transferred back to
 14 35 the district court for sentencing prior to the child's 18th
 15  1 birthday. The court may order the official juvenile court
 15  2 records in such a delinquency proceeding to be public records
 15  3 if the juvenile has been subsequently adjudicated delinquent
 15  4 for a public offense that would be a serious misdemeanor,
 15  5 aggravated misdemeanor, or felony offense if committed by an
 15  6 adult, or another delinquency proceeding is pending seeking
 15  7 such an adjudication. The bill provides that records subject
 15  8 to a public records order may be sealed at a later date
 15  9 pursuant to Code section 232.150.
 15 10    RIGHT TO REVIEW AND RELEASE A CONFIDENTIAL COMPLAINT.  The
 15 11 bill provides that delinquency complaints shall be released
 15 12 in accordance with Code section 915.25. Under current Code
 15 13 section 915.25, a complaint which alleges that a child who is
 15 14 at least 10 years of age committed a delinquent act, which if
 15 15 committed by an adult would be a public offense, is a public
 15 16 record. Current Code section 915.25 authorizes the court,
 15 17 its designee, or law enforcement officials to release such
 15 18 a complaint, including the identity of the child. The bill
 15 19 amends Code section 915.25 to provide that such a complaint
 15 20 is confidential unless the complaint alleges that the child
 15 21 committed a delinquent act that if committed by an adult would
 15 22 be a forcible felony. However, the bill authorizes state and
 15 23 local enforcement officials to release a confidential complaint
 15 24 against a child if the child is at large and doing so is deemed
 15 25 necessary for the protection of the public or the safety of
 15 26 the child. If the complaint is not confidential because the
 15 27 alleged delinquent act is an act that would be a forcible
 15 28 felony if committed by an adult, the court, its designee,
 15 29 or law enforcement officials may release such a complaint,
 15 30 including the identity of the child.
 15 31    The bill provides that an intake or juvenile court officer
 15 32 shall disclose to the alleged victim of a delinquent act, upon
 15 33 request, the complaint, the name and address of the child who
 15 34 allegedly committed the delinquent act, and the disposition
 15 35 of the complaint. If the alleged delinquent act would be
 16  1 a forcible felony if committed by an adult, the intake or
 16  2 juvenile court officer shall provide notification to the victim
 16  3 as required by Code section 915.24.
 16  4    SEALING OF JUVENILE COURT RECORDS UNAVAILABLE FOR
 16  5 OPERATING=WHILE=INTOXICATED VIOLATIONS.  Under current Code
 16  6 section 232.150, a court shall order juvenile court records
 16  7 to be sealed if the person who is the subject of the juvenile
 16  8 court records is 18 years of age or older and 2 years have
 16  9 elapsed since the last official action in the person's case,
 16 10 the person has not been subsequently convicted of a felony
 16 11 or an aggravated or serious misdemeanor or adjudicated a
 16 12 delinquent child for an act which if committed by an adult
 16 13 would be a felony, an aggravated misdemeanor, or a serious
 16 14 misdemeanor and no proceeding is pending seeking such
 16 15 conviction or adjudication, and the person was not placed on
 16 16 youthful offender status, transferred back to district court
 16 17 after the youthful offender's 18th birthday, and sentenced for
 16 18 the offense which precipitated the youthful offender placement.
 16 19 The bill in newly designated Code section 232.150(4) provides
 16 20 that the court shall not seal a person's juvenile court records
 16 21 if the person was adjudicated delinquent for violating Code
 16 22 section 321J.2, which prohibits the operation of a motor
 16 23 vehicle while under the influence of alcohol or a drug.
 16 24    RELEASE OF CONFIDENTIAL RECORDS.  The bill provides that a
 16 25 public record which is confidential under the provisions of
 16 26 Code chapter 232 shall only be subject to release upon order of
 16 27 a court in a proceeding under Code chapter 232.
 16 28    EXISTING CONFIDENTIALITY EXEMPTIONS.  The bill retains
 16 29 certain existing exemptions to confidentiality of juvenile
 16 30 court records. Pursuant to Code section 692A.121(8), records
 16 31 concerning sex offense convictions which are committed by
 16 32 minors may be released in the same manner as records of
 16 33 convictions of adults. Pursuant to Code section 915.10A,
 16 34 information concerning a juvenile charged with a felony offense
 16 35 may be released pursuant to an automated victim notification
 17  1 system. Under the bill, these exemptions to confidentiality
 17  2 are not amended and therefore still apply to juvenile court
 17  3 records.
 17  4    RIGHT TO COUNSEL.  The bill in Code section 232.11 provides
 17  5 that a child has the right to be represented by counsel at a
 17  6 hearing on a confidentiality order under Code section 232.149A
 17  7 or a public records order under Code section 232.149B.
 17  8    APPLICABILITY.  The bill applies to juvenile delinquency
 17  9 proceedings which are pending or arise on or after July 1,
 17 10 2016.

 11 21 remaining public records.
 11 22    ACCESS TO CONFIDENTIAL JUVENILE RECORDS.  The bill and
 11 23 Code section 232.147(3) provide that unless an order sealing
 11 24 confidential juvenile records has been entered, confidential
 11 25 juvenile records may still be inspected, without a court
 11 26 order, by the judge and professional court staff, including
 11 27 juvenile court officers; the child and the child's counsel;
 11 28 the child's parent, guardian or custodian, court appointed
 11 29 special advocate, and guardian ad litem, and the members of
 11 30 the child advocacy board created in Code section 237.16 or a
 11 31 local citizen foster care review board created in accordance
 11 32 with Code section 237.19 who are assigning or reviewing the
 11 33 child's case; the county attorney and the county attorney's
 11 34 assistants; an agency, association, facility, or institution
 11 35 which has custody of the child, or is legally responsible for
 12  1 the care, treatment, or supervision of the child, including
 12  2 the department of human services; a court, court professional
 12  3 staff, and adult probation officers in connection with the
 12  4 preparation of a presentence report concerning a person
 12  5 who prior thereto had been the subject of a juvenile court
 12  6 delinquency proceeding; the child's foster parent or an
 12  7 individual providing preadoptive care to the child; the state
 12  8 public defender; the department of corrections; a judicial
 12  9 district department of correctional services; the board of
 12 10 parole; the superintendent or the superintendent's designee of
 12 11 the school district for the school attended by the child or
 12 12 the authorities in charge of an accredited nonpublic school
 12 13 attended by the child; a member of the armed forces of the
 12 14 United States who is conducting a background investigation of
 12 15 an individual pursuant to federal law; the statistical analysis
 12 16 center for the purposes stated in Code section 216A.136; a
 12 17 state or local law enforcement agency; and the alleged victim
 12 18 of any delinquent act in the proceeding.
 12 19    The bill in newly designated Code section 232.147(3A)
 12 20 provides that juvenile court records containing a petition or
 12 21 complaint alleging the commission of a delinquent act that
 12 22 would be a forcible felony if committed by an adult shall be
 12 23 public records unless subject to a confidentiality order under
 12 24 Code section 232.149A or a sealing order under Code section
 12 25 232.150.  However, the bill provides that such official records
 12 26 shall not be available to the public or any governmental
 12 27 agency through the internet or in an electronic customized
 12 28 data report unless the child has been adjudicated delinquent
 12 29 in the matter.  Nevertheless, the bill provides that official
 12 30 juvenile court records may be disclosed without a court order
 12 31 through the internet or in an electronic customized data
 12 32 report prior to the child being adjudicated delinquent to the
 12 33 judge and professional court staff, including juvenile court
 12 34 officers; the child's counsel or guardian ad litem; the county
 12 35 attorney and the county attorney's assistants; a court, court
 13  1 professional staff, and adult probation officers in connection
 13  2 with the preparation of a presentence report concerning a
 13  3 person who prior thereto had been the subject of a juvenile
 13  4 court proceeding; a state or local law enforcement agency; the
 13  5 state public defender; the statistical analysis center for
 13  6 the purposes stated in Code section 216A.136; the department
 13  7 of human services; the department of corrections; a judicial
 13  8 district department of correctional services; and the board of
 13  9 parole.
 13 10    CONFIDENTIALITY OF TRANSCRIPTS.  The bill in newly
 13 11 designated Code section 232.147(3B) provides that if the court
 13 12 has excluded the public from a hearing pursuant to Code section
 13 13 232.39 or 232.92, the transcript of the proceedings shall not
 13 14 be deemed a public record and inspection and disclosure of
 13 15 the contents of the transcript shall not be permitted except
 13 16 pursuant to a court order or unless otherwise provided in Code
 13 17 chapter 232.
 13 18    USE OF ADJUDICATION OF DELINQUENCY FOR PENALTY ENHANCEMENTS
 13 19 OR EVIDENCE.  The bill in newly designated Code section
 13 20 232.147(13) provides that the confidentiality of a final
 13 21 adjudication of delinquency under Code section 232.147 or
 13 22 pursuant to Code section 232.149A shall not prohibit the state
 13 23 from pleading or proving the adjudication at a subsequent
 13 24 criminal or delinquency proceeding for the purpose of penalty
 13 25 enhancement when a provision of the Code specifically deems the
 13 26 delinquency adjudication to constitute a final conviction.
 13 27    The bill in newly designated Code section 232.147(14)
 13 28 provides that the provisions of the bill shall not be construed
 13 29 to limit or restrict the production, use, or introduction
 13 30 of official juvenile court records in any juvenile or adult
 13 31 criminal proceeding, where such records are relevant and deemed
 13 32 admissible under any other provision of the law.
 13 33    CONFIDENTIALITY OF RECORDS AND FILES OF CRIMINAL OR
 13 34 JUVENILE JUSTICE AGENCIES.  Under current law, records and
 13 35 files of a criminal or juvenile justice agency concerning
 14  1 a child involved in a delinquent act are public records,
 14  2 subject to certain exceptions. The bill in Code section
 14  3 232.149 provides that the records and files of a criminal or
 14  4 juvenile justice agency, an intake officer, or a juvenile court
 14  5 officer concerning a child involved in a delinquent act are
 14  6 confidential. The bill further provides that the records of an
 14  7 intake officer or juvenile court officer containing a dismissal
 14  8 of a complaint or an informal adjustment of a complaint when
 14  9 no petition is filed relating to the complaint, shall not be
 14 10 available to the public, but may be disclosed to the judge and
 14 11 professional court staff, including juvenile court officers;
 14 12 the child's counsel or guardian ad litem; the county attorney
 14 13 and county attorney's assistants;  the superintendent or the
 14 14 superintendent's designee of the school district for the
 14 15 school attended by the child or the authorities in charge of
 14 16 an accredited nonpublic school attended by the child; a member
 14 17 of the armed forces of the United States who is conducting a
 14 18 background investigation of an individual pursuant to federal
 14 19 law; the statistical analysis center for the purposes stated
 14 20 in Code section 216A.136; the state public defender;  the
 14 21 department of human services; and the alleged victim of the
 14 22 delinquent act.
 14 23    PUBLIC RECORDS HEARINGS.  The bill enacts new Code section
 14 24 232.149B, which provides that a person may apply for a court
 14 25 order to make confidential juvenile court records public.
 14 26 The bill provides that a rebuttable presumption exists that
 14 27 official juvenile court records shall remain confidential. The
 14 28 bill provides that the court shall order the official juvenile
 14 29 court records in such a delinquency proceeding to be public
 14 30 records if either the public's interest in making the records
 14 31 public outweighs the juvenile's interest in maintaining the
 14 32 confidentiality of the records or the juvenile has been placed
 14 33 on youthful offender status pursuant to Code section 232.45(7)
 14 34 and Code section 907.3A(1), and will be transferred back to
 14 35 the district court for sentencing prior to the child's 18th
 15  1 birthday. The court may order the official juvenile court
 15  2 records in such a delinquency proceeding to be public records
 15  3 if the juvenile has been subsequently adjudicated delinquent
 15  4 for a public offense that would be a serious misdemeanor,
 15  5 aggravated misdemeanor, or felony offense if committed by an
 15  6 adult, or another delinquency proceeding is pending seeking
 15  7 such an adjudication. The bill provides that records subject
 15  8 to a public records order may be sealed at a later date
 15  9 pursuant to Code section 232.150.
 15 10    RIGHT TO REVIEW AND RELEASE A CONFIDENTIAL COMPLAINT.  The
 15 11 bill provides that delinquency complaints shall be released
 15 12 in accordance with Code section 915.25. Under current Code
 15 13 section 915.25, a complaint which alleges that a child who is
 15 14 at least 10 years of age committed a delinquent act, which if
 15 15 committed by an adult would be a public offense, is a public
 15 16 record. Current Code section 915.25 authorizes the court,
 15 17 its designee, or law enforcement officials to release such
 15 18 a complaint, including the identity of the child. The bill
 15 19 amends Code section 915.25 to provide that such a complaint
 15 20 is confidential unless the complaint alleges that the child
 15 21 committed a delinquent act that if committed by an adult would
 15 22 be a forcible felony. However, the bill authorizes state and
 15 23 local enforcement officials to release a confidential complaint
 15 24 against a child if the child is at large and doing so is deemed
 15 25 necessary for the protection of the public or the safety of
 15 26 the child. If the complaint is not confidential because the
 15 27 alleged delinquent act is an act that would be a forcible
 15 28 felony if committed by an adult, the court, its designee,
 15 29 or law enforcement officials may release such a complaint,
 15 30 including the identity of the child.
 15 31    The bill provides that an intake or juvenile court officer
 15 32 shall disclose to the alleged victim of a delinquent act, upon
 15 33 request, the complaint, the name and address of the child who
 15 34 allegedly committed the delinquent act, and the disposition
 15 35 of the complaint. If the alleged delinquent act would be
 16  1 a forcible felony if committed by an adult, the intake or
 16  2 juvenile court officer shall provide notification to the victim
 16  3 as required by Code section 915.24.
 16  4    SEALING OF JUVENILE COURT RECORDS UNAVAILABLE FOR
 16  5 OPERATING=WHILE=INTOXICATED VIOLATIONS.  Under current Code
 16  6 section 232.150, a court shall order juvenile court records
 16  7 to be sealed if the person who is the subject of the juvenile
 16  8 court records is 18 years of age or older and 2 years have
 16  9 elapsed since the last official action in the person's case,
 16 10 the person has not been subsequently convicted of a felony
 16 11 or an aggravated or serious misdemeanor or adjudicated a
 16 12 delinquent child for an act which if committed by an adult
 16 13 would be a felony, an aggravated misdemeanor, or a serious
 16 14 misdemeanor and no proceeding is pending seeking such
 16 15 conviction or adjudication, and the person was not placed on
 16 16 youthful offender status, transferred back to district court
 16 17 after the youthful offender's 18th birthday, and sentenced for
 16 18 the offense which precipitated the youthful offender placement.
 16 19 The bill in newly designated Code section 232.150(4) provides
 16 20 that the court shall not seal a person's juvenile court records
 16 21 if the person was adjudicated delinquent for violating Code
 16 22 section 321J.2, which prohibits the operation of a motor
 16 23 vehicle while under the influence of alcohol or a drug.
 16 24    RELEASE OF CONFIDENTIAL RECORDS.  The bill provides that a
 16 25 public record which is confidential under the provisions of
 16 26 Code chapter 232 shall only be subject to release upon order of
 16 27 a court in a proceeding under Code chapter 232.
 16 28    EXISTING CONFIDENTIALITY EXEMPTIONS.  The bill retains
 16 29 certain existing exemptions to confidentiality of juvenile
 16 30 court records. Pursuant to Code section 692A.121(8), records
 16 31 concerning sex offense convictions which are committed by
 16 32 minors may be released in the same manner as records of
 16 33 convictions of adults. Pursuant to Code section 915.10A,
 16 34 information concerning a juvenile charged with a felony offense
 16 35 may be released pursuant to an automated victim notification
 17  1 system. Under the bill, these exemptions to confidentiality
 17  2 are not amended and therefore still apply to juvenile court
 17  3 records.
 17  4    RIGHT TO COUNSEL.  The bill in Code section 232.11 provides
 17  5 that a child has the right to be represented by counsel at a
 17  6 hearing on a confidentiality order under Code section 232.149A
 17  7 or a public records order under Code section 232.149B.
 17  8    APPLICABILITY.  The bill applies to juvenile delinquency
 17  9 proceedings which are pending or arise on or after July 1,
 17 10 2016.

 11 22    ACCESS TO CONFIDENTIAL JUVENILE RECORDS.  The bill and
 11 23 Code section 232.147(3) provide that unless an order sealing
 11 24 confidential juvenile records has been entered, confidential
 11 25 juvenile records may still be inspected, without a court
 11 26 order, by the judge and professional court staff, including
 11 27 juvenile court officers; the child and the child's counsel;
 11 28 the child's parent, guardian or custodian, court appointed
 11 29 special advocate, and guardian ad litem, and the members of
 11 30 the child advocacy board created in Code section 237.16 or a
 11 31 local citizen foster care review board created in accordance
 11 32 with Code section 237.19 who are assigning or reviewing the
 11 33 child's case; the county attorney and the county attorney's
 11 34 assistants; an agency, association, facility, or institution
 11 35 which has custody of the child, or is legally responsible for
 12  1 the care, treatment, or supervision of the child, including
 12  2 the department of human services; a court, court professional
 12  3 staff, and adult probation officers in connection with the
 12  4 preparation of a presentence report concerning a person
 12  5 who prior thereto had been the subject of a juvenile court
 12  6 delinquency proceeding; the child's foster parent or an
 12  7 individual providing preadoptive care to the child; the state
 12  8 public defender; the department of corrections; a judicial
 12  9 district department of correctional services; the board of
 12 10 parole; the superintendent or the superintendent's designee of

 12 12 the authorities in charge of an accredited nonpublic school
 12 13 attended by the child; a member of the armed forces of the
 12 14 United States who is conducting a background investigation of
 12 15 an individual pursuant to federal law; the statistical analysis
 12 16 center for the purposes stated in Code section 216A.136; a
 12 17 state or local law enforcement agency; and the alleged victim
 12 18 of any delinquent act in the proceeding.
 12 19    The bill in newly designated Code section 232.147(3A)
 12 20 provides that juvenile court records containing a petition or
 12 21 complaint alleging the commission of a delinquent act that
 12 22 would be a forcible felony if committed by an adult shall be
 12 23 public records unless subject to a confidentiality order under
 12 24 Code section 232.149A or a sealing order under Code section
 12 25 232.150.  However, the bill provides that such official records
 12 26 shall not be available to the public or any governmental
 12 27 agency through the internet or in an electronic customized
 12 28 data report unless the child has been adjudicated delinquent
 12 29 in the matter.  Nevertheless, the bill provides that official
 12 30 juvenile court records may be disclosed without a court order
 12 31 through the internet or in an electronic customized data
 12 32 report prior to the child being adjudicated delinquent to the
 12 33 judge and professional court staff, including juvenile court
 12 34 officers; the child's counsel or guardian ad litem; the county
 12 35 attorney and the county attorney's assistants; a court, court
 13  1 professional staff, and adult probation officers in connection
 13  2 with the preparation of a presentence report concerning a

 13  6 the purposes stated in Code section 216A.136; the department
 13  7 of human services; the department of corrections; a judicial
 13  8 district department of correctional services; and the board of
 13  9 parole.
 13 10    CONFIDENTIALITY OF TRANSCRIPTS.  The bill in newly
 13 11 designated Code section 232.147(3B) provides that if the court
 13 12 has excluded the public from a hearing pursuant to Code section
 13 13 232.39 or 232.92, the transcript of the proceedings shall not
 13 14 be deemed a public record and inspection and disclosure of
 13 15 the contents of the transcript shall not be permitted except
 13 16 pursuant to a court order or unless otherwise provided in Code
 13 17 chapter 232.
 13 18    USE OF ADJUDICATION OF DELINQUENCY FOR PENALTY ENHANCEMENTS
 13 19 OR EVIDENCE.  The bill in newly designated Code section
 13 20 232.147(13) provides that the confidentiality of a final
 13 21 adjudication of delinquency under Code section 232.147 or
 13 22 pursuant to Code section 232.149A shall not prohibit the state
 13 23 from pleading or proving the adjudication at a subsequent
 13 24 criminal or delinquency proceeding for the purpose of penalty
 13 25 enhancement when a provision of the Code specifically deems the
 13 26 delinquency adjudication to constitute a final conviction.
 13 27    The bill in newly designated Code section 232.147(14)
 13 28 provides that the provisions of the bill shall not be construed
 13 29 to limit or restrict the production, use, or introduction
 13 30 of official juvenile court records in any juvenile or adult
 13 31 criminal proceeding, where such records are relevant and deemed
 13 32 admissible under any other provision of the law.
 13 33    CONFIDENTIALITY OF RECORDS AND FILES OF CRIMINAL OR
 13 34 JUVENILE JUSTICE AGENCIES.  Under current law, records and
 13 35 files of a criminal or juvenile justice agency concerning
 14  1 a child involved in a delinquent act are public records,
 14  2 subject to certain exceptions. The bill in Code section
 14  3 232.149 provides that the records and files of a criminal or
 14  4 juvenile justice agency, an intake officer, or a juvenile court
 14  5 officer concerning a child involved in a delinquent act are
 14  6 confidential. The bill further provides that the records of an
 14  7 intake officer or juvenile court officer containing a dismissal
 14  8 of a complaint or an informal adjustment of a complaint when
 14  9 no petition is filed relating to the complaint, shall not be
 14 10 available to the public, but may be disclosed to the judge and
 14 11 professional court staff, including juvenile court officers;
 14 12 the child's counsel or guardian ad litem; the county attorney
 14 13 and county attorney's assistants;  the superintendent or the
 14 14 superintendent's designee of the school district for the
 14 15 school attended by the child or the authorities in charge of
 14 16 an accredited nonpublic school attended by the child; a member
 14 17 of the armed forces of the United States who is conducting a
 14 18 background investigation of an individual pursuant to federal
 14 19 law; the statistical analysis center for the purposes stated
 14 20 in Code section 216A.136; the state public defender;  the
 14 21 department of human services; and the alleged victim of the
 14 22 delinquent act.
 14 23    PUBLIC RECORDS HEARINGS.  The bill enacts new Code section
 14 24 232.149B, which provides that a person may apply for a court
 14 25 order to make confidential juvenile court records public.
 14 26 The bill provides that a rebuttable presumption exists that
 14 27 official juvenile court records shall remain confidential. The
 14 28 bill provides that the court shall order the official juvenile
 14 29 court records in such a delinquency proceeding to be public
 14 30 records if either the public's interest in making the records
 14 31 public outweighs the juvenile's interest in maintaining the
 14 32 confidentiality of the records or the juvenile has been placed
 14 33 on youthful offender status pursuant to Code section 232.45(7)
 14 34 and Code section 907.3A(1), and will be transferred back to
 14 35 the district court for sentencing prior to the child's 18th
 15  1 birthday. The court may order the official juvenile court
 15  2 records in such a delinquency proceeding to be public records
 15  3 if the juvenile has been subsequently adjudicated delinquent
 15  4 for a public offense that would be a serious misdemeanor,
 15  5 aggravated misdemeanor, or felony offense if committed by an
 15  6 adult, or another delinquency proceeding is pending seeking
 15  7 such an adjudication. The bill provides that records subject
 15  8 to a public records order may be sealed at a later date
 15  9 pursuant to Code section 232.150.
 15 10    RIGHT TO REVIEW AND RELEASE A CONFIDENTIAL COMPLAINT.  The
 15 11 bill provides that delinquency complaints shall be released
 15 12 in accordance with Code section 915.25. Under current Code
 15 13 section 915.25, a complaint which alleges that a child who is
 15 14 at least 10 years of age committed a delinquent act, which if
 15 15 committed by an adult would be a public offense, is a public
 15 16 record. Current Code section 915.25 authorizes the court,
 15 17 its designee, or law enforcement officials to release such
 15 18 a complaint, including the identity of the child. The bill
 15 19 amends Code section 915.25 to provide that such a complaint
 15 20 is confidential unless the complaint alleges that the child
 15 21 committed a delinquent act that if committed by an adult would
 15 22 be a forcible felony. However, the bill authorizes state and
 15 23 local enforcement officials to release a confidential complaint
 15 24 against a child if the child is at large and doing so is deemed
 15 25 necessary for the protection of the public or the safety of
 15 26 the child. If the complaint is not confidential because the
 15 27 alleged delinquent act is an act that would be a forcible
 15 28 felony if committed by an adult, the court, its designee,
 15 29 or law enforcement officials may release such a complaint,
 15 30 including the identity of the child.
 15 31    The bill provides that an intake or juvenile court officer
 15 32 shall disclose to the alleged victim of a delinquent act, upon
 15 33 request, the complaint, the name and address of the child who
 15 34 allegedly committed the delinquent act, and the disposition
 15 35 of the complaint. If the alleged delinquent act would be
 16  1 a forcible felony if committed by an adult, the intake or
 16  2 juvenile court officer shall provide notification to the victim
 16  3 as required by Code section 915.24.
 16  4    SEALING OF JUVENILE COURT RECORDS UNAVAILABLE FOR
 16  5 OPERATING=WHILE=INTOXICATED VIOLATIONS.  Under current Code
 16  6 section 232.150, a court shall order juvenile court records
 16  7 to be sealed if the person who is the subject of the juvenile
 16  8 court records is 18 years of age or older and 2 years have
 16  9 elapsed since the last official action in the person's case,
 16 10 the person has not been subsequently convicted of a felony
 16 11 or an aggravated or serious misdemeanor or adjudicated a
 16 12 delinquent child for an act which if committed by an adult
 16 13 would be a felony, an aggravated misdemeanor, or a serious
 16 14 misdemeanor and no proceeding is pending seeking such
 16 15 conviction or adjudication, and the person was not placed on
 16 16 youthful offender status, transferred back to district court
 16 17 after the youthful offender's 18th birthday, and sentenced for
 16 18 the offense which precipitated the youthful offender placement.
 16 19 The bill in newly designated Code section 232.150(4) provides
 16 20 that the court shall not seal a person's juvenile court records
 16 21 if the person was adjudicated delinquent for violating Code
 16 22 section 321J.2, which prohibits the operation of a motor
 16 23 vehicle while under the influence of alcohol or a drug.
 16 24    RELEASE OF CONFIDENTIAL RECORDS.  The bill provides that a
 16 25 public record which is confidential under the provisions of
 16 26 Code chapter 232 shall only be subject to release upon order of
 16 27 a court in a proceeding under Code chapter 232.
 16 28    EXISTING CONFIDENTIALITY EXEMPTIONS.  The bill retains
 16 29 certain existing exemptions to confidentiality of juvenile
 16 30 court records. Pursuant to Code section 692A.121(8), records
 16 31 concerning sex offense convictions which are committed by
 16 32 minors may be released in the same manner as records of
 16 33 convictions of adults. Pursuant to Code section 915.10A,
 16 34 information concerning a juvenile charged with a felony offense
 16 35 may be released pursuant to an automated victim notification
 17  1 system. Under the bill, these exemptions to confidentiality
 17  2 are not amended and therefore still apply to juvenile court
 17  3 records.
 17  4    RIGHT TO COUNSEL.  The bill in Code section 232.11 provides
 17  5 that a child has the right to be represented by counsel at a
 17  6 hearing on a confidentiality order under Code section 232.149A
 17  7 or a public records order under Code section 232.149B.
 17  8    APPLICABILITY.  The bill applies to juvenile delinquency
 17  9 proceedings which are pending or arise on or after July 1,
 17 10 2016.

 11 23 Code section 232.147(3) provide that unless an order sealing
 11 24 confidential juvenile records has been entered, confidential
 11 25 juvenile records may still be inspected, without a court
 11 26 order, by the judge and professional court staff, including
 11 27 juvenile court officers; the child and the child's counsel;
 11 28 the child's parent, guardian or custodian, court appointed
 11 29 special advocate, and guardian ad litem, and the members of
 11 30 the child advocacy board created in Code section 237.16 or a
 11 31 local citizen foster care review board created in accordance
 11 32 with Code section 237.19 who are assigning or reviewing the
 11 33 child's case; the county attorney and the county attorney's
 11 34 assistants; an agency, association, facility, or institution
 11 35 which has custody of the child, or is legally responsible for
 12  1 the care, treatment, or supervision of the child, including
 12  2 the department of human services; a court, court professional
 12  3 staff, and adult probation officers in connection with the
 12  4 preparation of a presentence report concerning a person
 12  5 who prior thereto had been the subject of a juvenile court
 12  6 delinquency proceeding; the child's foster parent or an
 12  7 individual providing preadoptive care to the child; the state
 12  8 public defender; the department of corrections; a judicial
 12  9 district department of correctional services; the board of
 12 10 parole; the superintendent or the superintendent's designee of

 12 14 United States who is conducting a background investigation of
 12 15 an individual pursuant to federal law; the statistical analysis
 12 16 center for the purposes stated in Code section 216A.136; a
 12 17 state or local law enforcement agency; and the alleged victim
 12 18 of any delinquent act in the proceeding.
 12 19    The bill in newly designated Code section 232.147(3A)
 12 20 provides that juvenile court records containing a petition or
 12 21 complaint alleging the commission of a delinquent act that
 12 22 would be a forcible felony if committed by an adult shall be
 12 23 public records unless subject to a confidentiality order under
 12 24 Code section 232.149A or a sealing order under Code section
 12 25 232.150.  However, the bill provides that such official records
 12 26 shall not be available to the public or any governmental
 12 27 agency through the internet or in an electronic customized
 12 28 data report unless the child has been adjudicated delinquent
 12 29 in the matter.  Nevertheless, the bill provides that official
 12 30 juvenile court records may be disclosed without a court order
 12 31 through the internet or in an electronic customized data
 12 32 report prior to the child being adjudicated delinquent to the
 12 33 judge and professional court staff, including juvenile court
 12 34 officers; the child's counsel or guardian ad litem; the county
 12 35 attorney and the county attorney's assistants; a court, court
 13  1 professional staff, and adult probation officers in connection
 13  2 with the preparation of a presentence report concerning a
 13  3 person who prior thereto had been the subject of a juvenile
 13  4 court proceeding; a state or local law enforcement agency; the
 13  5 state public defender; the statistical analysis center for
 13  6 the purposes stated in Code section 216A.136; the department
 13  7 of human services; the department of corrections; a judicial
 13  8 district department of correctional services; and the board of
 13  9 parole.
 13 10    CONFIDENTIALITY OF TRANSCRIPTS.  The bill in newly
 13 11 designated Code section 232.147(3B) provides that if the court
 13 12 has excluded the public from a hearing pursuant to Code section
 13 13 232.39 or 232.92, the transcript of the proceedings shall not
 13 14 be deemed a public record and inspection and disclosure of
 13 15 the contents of the transcript shall not be permitted except
 13 16 pursuant to a court order or unless otherwise provided in Code
 13 17 chapter 232.
 13 18    USE OF ADJUDICATION OF DELINQUENCY FOR PENALTY ENHANCEMENTS
 13 19 OR EVIDENCE.  The bill in newly designated Code section
 13 20 232.147(13) provides that the confidentiality of a final
 13 21 adjudication of delinquency under Code section 232.147 or
 13 22 pursuant to Code section 232.149A shall not prohibit the state
 13 23 from pleading or proving the adjudication at a subsequent
 13 24 criminal or delinquency proceeding for the purpose of penalty
 13 25 enhancement when a provision of the Code specifically deems the
 13 26 delinquency adjudication to constitute a final conviction.
 13 27    The bill in newly designated Code section 232.147(14)
 13 28 provides that the provisions of the bill shall not be construed
 13 29 to limit or restrict the production, use, or introduction
 13 30 of official juvenile court records in any juvenile or adult
 13 31 criminal proceeding, where such records are relevant and deemed
 13 32 admissible under any other provision of the law.
 13 33    CONFIDENTIALITY OF RECORDS AND FILES OF CRIMINAL OR
 13 34 JUVENILE JUSTICE AGENCIES.  Under current law, records and
 13 35 files of a criminal or juvenile justice agency concerning
 14  1 a child involved in a delinquent act are public records,
 14  2 subject to certain exceptions. The bill in Code section
 14  3 232.149 provides that the records and files of a criminal or
 14  4 juvenile justice agency, an intake officer, or a juvenile court
 14  5 officer concerning a child involved in a delinquent act are
 14  6 confidential. The bill further provides that the records of an
 14  7 intake officer or juvenile court officer containing a dismissal
 14  8 of a complaint or an informal adjustment of a complaint when
 14  9 no petition is filed relating to the complaint, shall not be
 14 10 available to the public, but may be disclosed to the judge and
 14 11 professional court staff, including juvenile court officers;
 14 12 the child's counsel or guardian ad litem; the county attorney
 14 13 and county attorney's assistants;  the superintendent or the

 14 20 in Code section 216A.136; the state public defender;  the
 14 21 department of human services; and the alleged victim of the
 14 22 delinquent act.
 14 23    PUBLIC RECORDS HEARINGS.  The bill enacts new Code section
 14 24 232.149B, which provides that a person may apply for a court
 14 25 order to make confidential juvenile court records public.
 14 26 The bill provides that a rebuttable presumption exists that
 14 27 official juvenile court records shall remain confidential. The
 14 28 bill provides that the court shall order the official juvenile
 14 29 court records in such a delinquency proceeding to be public
 14 30 records if either the public's interest in making the records
 14 31 public outweighs the juvenile's interest in maintaining the
 14 32 confidentiality of the records or the juvenile has been placed
 14 33 on youthful offender status pursuant to Code section 232.45(7)
 14 34 and Code section 907.3A(1), and will be transferred back to
 14 35 the district court for sentencing prior to the child's 18th
 15  1 birthday. The court may order the official juvenile court
 15  2 records in such a delinquency proceeding to be public records
 15  3 if the juvenile has been subsequently adjudicated delinquent
 15  4 for a public offense that would be a serious misdemeanor,
 15  5 aggravated misdemeanor, or felony offense if committed by an
 15  6 adult, or another delinquency proceeding is pending seeking
 15  7 such an adjudication. The bill provides that records subject
 15  8 to a public records order may be sealed at a later date
 15  9 pursuant to Code section 232.150.
 15 10    RIGHT TO REVIEW AND RELEASE A CONFIDENTIAL COMPLAINT.  The
 15 11 bill provides that delinquency complaints shall be released
 15 12 in accordance with Code section 915.25. Under current Code
 15 13 section 915.25, a complaint which alleges that a child who is
 15 14 at least 10 years of age committed a delinquent act, which if
 15 15 committed by an adult would be a public offense, is a public
 15 16 record. Current Code section 915.25 authorizes the court,
 15 17 its designee, or law enforcement officials to release such
 15 18 a complaint, including the identity of the child. The bill
 15 19 amends Code section 915.25 to provide that such a complaint
 15 20 is confidential unless the complaint alleges that the child
 15 21 committed a delinquent act that if committed by an adult would
 15 22 be a forcible felony. However, the bill authorizes state and
 15 23 local enforcement officials to release a confidential complaint
 15 24 against a child if the child is at large and doing so is deemed
 15 25 necessary for the protection of the public or the safety of
 15 26 the child. If the complaint is not confidential because the
 15 27 alleged delinquent act is an act that would be a forcible
 15 28 felony if committed by an adult, the court, its designee,
 15 29 or law enforcement officials may release such a complaint,
 15 30 including the identity of the child.
 15 31    The bill provides that an intake or juvenile court officer
 15 32 shall disclose to the alleged victim of a delinquent act, upon
 15 33 request, the complaint, the name and address of the child who
 15 34 allegedly committed the delinquent act, and the disposition
 15 35 of the complaint. If the alleged delinquent act would be
 16  1 a forcible felony if committed by an adult, the intake or
 16  2 juvenile court officer shall provide notification to the victim
 16  3 as required by Code section 915.24.
 16  4    SEALING OF JUVENILE COURT RECORDS UNAVAILABLE FOR
 16  5 OPERATING=WHILE=INTOXICATED VIOLATIONS.  Under current Code
 16  6 section 232.150, a court shall order juvenile court records
 16  7 to be sealed if the person who is the subject of the juvenile
 16  8 court records is 18 years of age or older and 2 years have
 16  9 elapsed since the last official action in the person's case,
 16 10 the person has not been subsequently convicted of a felony
 16 11 or an aggravated or serious misdemeanor or adjudicated a
 16 12 delinquent child for an act which if committed by an adult
 16 13 would be a felony, an aggravated misdemeanor, or a serious
 16 14 misdemeanor and no proceeding is pending seeking such
 16 15 conviction or adjudication, and the person was not placed on
 16 16 youthful offender status, transferred back to district court
 16 17 after the youthful offender's 18th birthday, and sentenced for
 16 18 the offense which precipitated the youthful offender placement.
 16 19 The bill in newly designated Code section 232.150(4) provides
 16 20 that the court shall not seal a person's juvenile court records
 16 21 if the person was adjudicated delinquent for violating Code
 16 22 section 321J.2, which prohibits the operation of a motor
 16 23 vehicle while under the influence of alcohol or a drug.
 16 24    RELEASE OF CONFIDENTIAL RECORDS.  The bill provides that a
 16 25 public record which is confidential under the provisions of
 16 26 Code chapter 232 shall only be subject to release upon order of
 16 27 a court in a proceeding under Code chapter 232.
 16 28    EXISTING CONFIDENTIALITY EXEMPTIONS.  The bill retains
 16 29 certain existing exemptions to confidentiality of juvenile
 16 30 court records. Pursuant to Code section 692A.121(8), records
 16 31 concerning sex offense convictions which are committed by
 16 32 minors may be released in the same manner as records of
 16 33 convictions of adults. Pursuant to Code section 915.10A,
 16 34 information concerning a juvenile charged with a felony offense
 16 35 may be released pursuant to an automated victim notification
 17  1 system. Under the bill, these exemptions to confidentiality
 17  2 are not amended and therefore still apply to juvenile court
 17  3 records.
 17  4    RIGHT TO COUNSEL.  The bill in Code section 232.11 provides
 17  5 that a child has the right to be represented by counsel at a
 17  6 hearing on a confidentiality order under Code section 232.149A
 17  7 or a public records order under Code section 232.149B.

 12 23 public records unless subject to a confidentiality order under
 12 24 Code section 232.149A or a sealing order under Code section

 13 33    CONFIDENTIALITY OF RECORDS AND FILES OF CRIMINAL OR
 13 34 JUVENILE JUSTICE AGENCIES.  Under current law, records and
 13 35 files of a criminal or juvenile justice agency concerning
 14  1 a child involved in a delinquent act are public records,
 14  2 subject to certain exceptions. The bill in Code section

 14  5 officer concerning a child involved in a delinquent act are

 14 17 of the armed forces of the United States who is conducting a
 14 18 background investigation of an individual pursuant to federal
 14 19 law; the statistical analysis center for the purposes stated
 14 20 in Code section 216A.136; the state public defender;  the
 14 21 department of human services; and the alleged victim of the
 14 22 delinquent act.
 14 23    PUBLIC RECORDS HEARINGS.  The bill enacts new Code section
 14 24 232.149B, which provides that a person may apply for a court
 14 25 order to make confidential juvenile court records public.
 14 26 The bill provides that a rebuttable presumption exists that
 14 27 official juvenile court records shall remain confidential. The
 14 28 bill provides that the court shall order the official juvenile
 14 29 court records in such a delinquency proceeding to be public
 14 30 records if either the public's interest in making the records
 14 31 public outweighs the juvenile's interest in maintaining the
 14 32 confidentiality of the records or the juvenile has been placed
 14 33 on youthful offender status pursuant to Code section 232.45(7)
 14 34 and Code section 907.3A(1), and will be transferred back to
 14 35 the district court for sentencing prior to the child's 18th
 15  1 birthday. The court may order the official juvenile court
 15  2 records in such a delinquency proceeding to be public records
 15  3 if the juvenile has been subsequently adjudicated delinquent
 15  4 for a public offense that would be a serious misdemeanor,
 15  5 aggravated misdemeanor, or felony offense if committed by an
 15  6 adult, or another delinquency proceeding is pending seeking
 15  7 such an adjudication. The bill provides that records subject
 15  8 to a public records order may be sealed at a later date
 15  9 pursuant to Code section 232.150.
 15 10    RIGHT TO REVIEW AND RELEASE A CONFIDENTIAL COMPLAINT.  The
 15 11 bill provides that delinquency complaints shall be released
 15 12 in accordance with Code section 915.25. Under current Code
 15 13 section 915.25, a complaint which alleges that a child who is
 15 14 at least 10 years of age committed a delinquent act, which if
 15 15 committed by an adult would be a public offense, is a public
 15 16 record. Current Code section 915.25 authorizes the court,
 15 17 its designee, or law enforcement officials to release such
 15 18 a complaint, including the identity of the child. The bill
 15 19 amends Code section 915.25 to provide that such a complaint
 15 20 is confidential unless the complaint alleges that the child
 15 21 committed a delinquent act that if committed by an adult would
 15 22 be a forcible felony. However, the bill authorizes state and
 15 23 local enforcement officials to release a confidential complaint
 15 24 against a child if the child is at large and doing so is deemed
 15 25 necessary for the protection of the public or the safety of
 15 26 the child. If the complaint is not confidential because the
 15 27 alleged delinquent act is an act that would be a forcible
 15 28 felony if committed by an adult, the court, its designee,
 15 29 or law enforcement officials may release such a complaint,
 15 30 including the identity of the child.
 15 31    The bill provides that an intake or juvenile court officer
 15 32 shall disclose to the alleged victim of a delinquent act, upon
 15 33 request, the complaint, the name and address of the child who
 15 34 allegedly committed the delinquent act, and the disposition
 15 35 of the complaint. If the alleged delinquent act would be
 16  1 a forcible felony if committed by an adult, the intake or
 16  2 juvenile court officer shall provide notification to the victim
 16  3 as required by Code section 915.24.
 16  4    SEALING OF JUVENILE COURT RECORDS UNAVAILABLE FOR
 16  5 OPERATING=WHILE=INTOXICATED VIOLATIONS.  Under current Code
 16  6 section 232.150, a court shall order juvenile court records
 16  7 to be sealed if the person who is the subject of the juvenile
 16  8 court records is 18 years of age or older and 2 years have
 16  9 elapsed since the last official action in the person's case,
 16 10 the person has not been subsequently convicted of a felony
 16 11 or an aggravated or serious misdemeanor or adjudicated a
 16 12 delinquent child for an act which if committed by an adult
 16 13 would be a felony, an aggravated misdemeanor, or a serious
 16 14 misdemeanor and no proceeding is pending seeking such
 16 15 conviction or adjudication, and the person was not placed on
 16 16 youthful offender status, transferred back to district court
 16 17 after the youthful offender's 18th birthday, and sentenced for
 16 18 the offense which precipitated the youthful offender placement.
 16 19 The bill in newly designated Code section 232.150(4) provides
 16 20 that the court shall not seal a person's juvenile court records
 16 21 if the person was adjudicated delinquent for violating Code
 16 22 section 321J.2, which prohibits the operation of a motor
 16 23 vehicle while under the influence of alcohol or a drug.
 16 24    RELEASE OF CONFIDENTIAL RECORDS.  The bill provides that a
 16 25 public record which is confidential under the provisions of
 16 26 Code chapter 232 shall only be subject to release upon order of
 16 27 a court in a proceeding under Code chapter 232.
 16 28    EXISTING CONFIDENTIALITY EXEMPTIONS.  The bill retains
 16 29 certain existing exemptions to confidentiality of juvenile
 16 30 court records. Pursuant to Code section 692A.121(8), records
 16 31 concerning sex offense convictions which are committed by
 16 32 minors may be released in the same manner as records of
 16 33 convictions of adults. Pursuant to Code section 915.10A,
 16 34 information concerning a juvenile charged with a felony offense
 16 35 may be released pursuant to an automated victim notification
 17  1 system. Under the bill, these exemptions to confidentiality
 17  2 are not amended and therefore still apply to juvenile court
 17  3 records.
 17  4    RIGHT TO COUNSEL.  The bill in Code section 232.11 provides
 17  5 that a child has the right to be represented by counsel at a
 17  6 hearing on a confidentiality order under Code section 232.149A
 17  7 or a public records order under Code section 232.149B.
 17  8    APPLICABILITY.  The bill applies to juvenile delinquency
 17  9 proceedings which are pending or arise on or after July 1,
 17 10 2016.

 11 25 juvenile records may still be inspected, without a court
 11 26 order, by the judge and professional court staff, including
 11 27 juvenile court officers; the child and the child's counsel;

 11 29 special advocate, and guardian ad litem, and the members of
 11 30 the child advocacy board created in Code section 237.16 or a

 12 14 United States who is conducting a background investigation of
 12 15 an individual pursuant to federal law; the statistical analysis
 12 16 center for the purposes stated in Code section 216A.136; a
 12 17 state or local law enforcement agency; and the alleged victim
 12 18 of any delinquent act in the proceeding.
 12 19    The bill in newly designated Code section 232.147(3A)
 12 20 provides that juvenile court records containing a petition or
 12 21 complaint alleging the commission of a delinquent act that
 12 22 would be a forcible felony if committed by an adult shall be
 12 23 public records unless subject to a confidentiality order under
 12 24 Code section 232.149A or a sealing order under Code section
 12 25 232.150.  However, the bill provides that such official records
 12 26 shall not be available to the public or any governmental
 12 27 agency through the internet or in an electronic customized
 12 28 data report unless the child has been adjudicated delinquent
 12 29 in the matter.  Nevertheless, the bill provides that official
 12 30 juvenile court records may be disclosed without a court order
 12 31 through the internet or in an electronic customized data
 12 32 report prior to the child being adjudicated delinquent to the
 12 33 judge and professional court staff, including juvenile court
 12 34 officers; the child's counsel or guardian ad litem; the county
 12 35 attorney and the county attorney's assistants; a court, court
 13  1 professional staff, and adult probation officers in connection
 13  2 with the preparation of a presentence report concerning a
 13  3 person who prior thereto had been the subject of a juvenile
 13  4 court proceeding; a state or local law enforcement agency; the
 13  5 state public defender; the statistical analysis center for
 13  6 the purposes stated in Code section 216A.136; the department
 13  7 of human services; the department of corrections; a judicial
 13  8 district department of correctional services; and the board of
 13  9 parole.
 13 10    CONFIDENTIALITY OF TRANSCRIPTS.  The bill in newly
 13 11 designated Code section 232.147(3B) provides that if the court
 13 12 has excluded the public from a hearing pursuant to Code section
 13 13 232.39 or 232.92, the transcript of the proceedings shall not
 13 14 be deemed a public record and inspection and disclosure of
 13 15 the contents of the transcript shall not be permitted except
 13 16 pursuant to a court order or unless otherwise provided in Code
 13 17 chapter 232.
 13 18    USE OF ADJUDICATION OF DELINQUENCY FOR PENALTY ENHANCEMENTS
 13 19 OR EVIDENCE.  The bill in newly designated Code section
 13 20 232.147(13) provides that the confidentiality of a final
 13 21 adjudication of delinquency under Code section 232.147 or
 13 22 pursuant to Code section 232.149A shall not prohibit the state
 13 23 from pleading or proving the adjudication at a subsequent
 13 24 criminal or delinquency proceeding for the purpose of penalty
 13 25 enhancement when a provision of the Code specifically deems the
 13 26 delinquency adjudication to constitute a final conviction.
 13 27    The bill in newly designated Code section 232.147(14)
 13 28 provides that the provisions of the bill shall not be construed
 13 29 to limit or restrict the production, use, or introduction
 13 30 of official juvenile court records in any juvenile or adult
 13 31 criminal proceeding, where such records are relevant and deemed
 13 32 admissible under any other provision of the law.
 13 33    CONFIDENTIALITY OF RECORDS AND FILES OF CRIMINAL OR
 13 34 JUVENILE JUSTICE AGENCIES.  Under current law, records and
 13 35 files of a criminal or juvenile justice agency concerning
 14  1 a child involved in a delinquent act are public records,
 14  2 subject to certain exceptions. The bill in Code section
 14  3 232.149 provides that the records and files of a criminal or
 14  4 juvenile justice agency, an intake officer, or a juvenile court
 14  5 officer concerning a child involved in a delinquent act are
 14  6 confidential. The bill further provides that the records of an
 14  7 intake officer or juvenile court officer containing a dismissal
 14  8 of a complaint or an informal adjustment of a complaint when
 14  9 no petition is filed relating to the complaint, shall not be
 14 10 available to the public, but may be disclosed to the judge and
 14 11 professional court staff, including juvenile court officers;
 14 12 the child's counsel or guardian ad litem; the county attorney
 14 13 and county attorney's assistants;  the superintendent or the
 14 14 superintendent's designee of the school district for the
 14 15 school attended by the child or the authorities in charge of

 14 19 law; the statistical analysis center for the purposes stated
 14 20 in Code section 216A.136; the state public defender;  the
 14 21 department of human services; and the alleged victim of the
 14 22 delinquent act.
 14 23    PUBLIC RECORDS HEARINGS.  The bill enacts new Code section
 14 24 232.149B, which provides that a person may apply for a court
 14 25 order to make confidential juvenile court records public.
 14 26 The bill provides that a rebuttable presumption exists that
 14 27 official juvenile court records shall remain confidential. The
 14 28 bill provides that the court shall order the official juvenile
 14 29 court records in such a delinquency proceeding to be public
 14 30 records if either the public's interest in making the records
 14 31 public outweighs the juvenile's interest in maintaining the
 14 32 confidentiality of the records or the juvenile has been placed
 14 33 on youthful offender status pursuant to Code section 232.45(7)
 14 34 and Code section 907.3A(1), and will be transferred back to
 14 35 the district court for sentencing prior to the child's 18th
 15  1 birthday. The court may order the official juvenile court
 15  2 records in such a delinquency proceeding to be public records
 15  3 if the juvenile has been subsequently adjudicated delinquent
 15  4 for a public offense that would be a serious misdemeanor,
 15  5 aggravated misdemeanor, or felony offense if committed by an
 15  6 adult, or another delinquency proceeding is pending seeking
 15  7 such an adjudication. The bill provides that records subject
 15  8 to a public records order may be sealed at a later date
 15  9 pursuant to Code section 232.150.
 15 10    RIGHT TO REVIEW AND RELEASE A CONFIDENTIAL COMPLAINT.  The
 15 11 bill provides that delinquency complaints shall be released
 15 12 in accordance with Code section 915.25. Under current Code
 15 13 section 915.25, a complaint which alleges that a child who is
 15 14 at least 10 years of age committed a delinquent act, which if
 15 15 committed by an adult would be a public offense, is a public
 15 16 record. Current Code section 915.25 authorizes the court,
 15 17 its designee, or law enforcement officials to release such
 15 18 a complaint, including the identity of the child. The bill
 15 19 amends Code section 915.25 to provide that such a complaint
 15 20 is confidential unless the complaint alleges that the child
 15 21 committed a delinquent act that if committed by an adult would
 15 22 be a forcible felony. However, the bill authorizes state and
 15 23 local enforcement officials to release a confidential complaint
 15 24 against a child if the child is at large and doing so is deemed
 15 25 necessary for the protection of the public or the safety of
 15 26 the child. If the complaint is not confidential because the
 15 27 alleged delinquent act is an act that would be a forcible
 15 28 felony if committed by an adult, the court, its designee,
 15 29 or law enforcement officials may release such a complaint,
 15 30 including the identity of the child.
 15 31    The bill provides that an intake or juvenile court officer
 15 32 shall disclose to the alleged victim of a delinquent act, upon
 15 33 request, the complaint, the name and address of the child who
 15 34 allegedly committed the delinquent act, and the disposition
 15 35 of the complaint. If the alleged delinquent act would be
 16  1 a forcible felony if committed by an adult, the intake or
 16  2 juvenile court officer shall provide notification to the victim
 16  3 as required by Code section 915.24.
 16  4    SEALING OF JUVENILE COURT RECORDS UNAVAILABLE FOR
 16  5 OPERATING=WHILE=INTOXICATED VIOLATIONS.  Under current Code
 16  6 section 232.150, a court shall order juvenile court records
 16  7 to be sealed if the person who is the subject of the juvenile
 16  8 court records is 18 years of age or older and 2 years have
 16  9 elapsed since the last official action in the person's case,
 16 10 the person has not been subsequently convicted of a felony
 16 11 or an aggravated or serious misdemeanor or adjudicated a
 16 12 delinquent child for an act which if committed by an adult
 16 13 would be a felony, an aggravated misdemeanor, or a serious
 16 14 misdemeanor and no proceeding is pending seeking such
 16 15 conviction or adjudication, and the person was not placed on
 16 16 youthful offender status, transferred back to district court
 16 17 after the youthful offender's 18th birthday, and sentenced for
 16 18 the offense which precipitated the youthful offender placement.
 16 19 The bill in newly designated Code section 232.150(4) provides
 16 20 that the court shall not seal a person's juvenile court records
 16 21 if the person was adjudicated delinquent for violating Code
 16 22 section 321J.2, which prohibits the operation of a motor
 16 23 vehicle while under the influence of alcohol or a drug.
 16 24    RELEASE OF CONFIDENTIAL RECORDS.  The bill provides that a
 16 25 public record which is confidential under the provisions of
 16 26 Code chapter 232 shall only be subject to release upon order of
 16 27 a court in a proceeding under Code chapter 232.
 16 28    EXISTING CONFIDENTIALITY EXEMPTIONS.  The bill retains
 16 29 certain existing exemptions to confidentiality of juvenile
 16 30 court records. Pursuant to Code section 692A.121(8), records
 16 31 concerning sex offense convictions which are committed by
 16 32 minors may be released in the same manner as records of

 16 35 may be released pursuant to an automated victim notification

 17  7 or a public records order under Code section 232.149B.

 12 24 Code section 232.149A or a sealing order under Code section

 12 26 shall not be available to the public or any governmental
 12 27 agency through the internet or in an electronic customized

 13 18    USE OF ADJUDICATION OF DELINQUENCY FOR PENALTY ENHANCEMENTS

 13 21 adjudication of delinquency under Code section 232.147 or

 13 33    CONFIDENTIALITY OF RECORDS AND FILES OF CRIMINAL OR
 13 34 JUVENILE JUSTICE AGENCIES.  Under current law, records and
 13 35 files of a criminal or juvenile justice agency concerning
 14  1 a child involved in a delinquent act are public records,
 14  2 subject to certain exceptions. The bill in Code section
 14  3 232.149 provides that the records and files of a criminal or
 14  4 juvenile justice agency, an intake officer, or a juvenile court
 14  5 officer concerning a child involved in a delinquent act are

 14 24 232.149B, which provides that a person may apply for a court
 14 25 order to make confidential juvenile court records public.
 14 26 The bill provides that a rebuttable presumption exists that

 14 28 bill provides that the court shall order the official juvenile
 14 29 court records in such a delinquency proceeding to be public
 14 30 records if either the public's interest in making the records
 14 31 public outweighs the juvenile's interest in maintaining the
 14 32 confidentiality of the records or the juvenile has been placed
 14 33 on youthful offender status pursuant to Code section 232.45(7)
 14 34 and Code section 907.3A(1), and will be transferred back to
 14 35 the district court for sentencing prior to the child's 18th
 15  1 birthday. The court may order the official juvenile court
 15  2 records in such a delinquency proceeding to be public records
 15  3 if the juvenile has been subsequently adjudicated delinquent
 15  4 for a public offense that would be a serious misdemeanor,
 15  5 aggravated misdemeanor, or felony offense if committed by an
 15  6 adult, or another delinquency proceeding is pending seeking
 15  7 such an adjudication. The bill provides that records subject
 15  8 to a public records order may be sealed at a later date
 15  9 pursuant to Code section 232.150.
 15 10    RIGHT TO REVIEW AND RELEASE A CONFIDENTIAL COMPLAINT.  The
 15 11 bill provides that delinquency complaints shall be released
 15 12 in accordance with Code section 915.25. Under current Code
 15 13 section 915.25, a complaint which alleges that a child who is
 15 14 at least 10 years of age committed a delinquent act, which if
 15 15 committed by an adult would be a public offense, is a public
 15 16 record. Current Code section 915.25 authorizes the court,
 15 17 its designee, or law enforcement officials to release such
 15 18 a complaint, including the identity of the child. The bill
 15 19 amends Code section 915.25 to provide that such a complaint
 15 20 is confidential unless the complaint alleges that the child
 15 21 committed a delinquent act that if committed by an adult would
 15 22 be a forcible felony. However, the bill authorizes state and
 15 23 local enforcement officials to release a confidential complaint
 15 24 against a child if the child is at large and doing so is deemed
 15 25 necessary for the protection of the public or the safety of
 15 26 the child. If the complaint is not confidential because the
 15 27 alleged delinquent act is an act that would be a forcible
 15 28 felony if committed by an adult, the court, its designee,
 15 29 or law enforcement officials may release such a complaint,
 15 30 including the identity of the child.
 15 31    The bill provides that an intake or juvenile court officer
 15 32 shall disclose to the alleged victim of a delinquent act, upon
 15 33 request, the complaint, the name and address of the child who
 15 34 allegedly committed the delinquent act, and the disposition
 15 35 of the complaint. If the alleged delinquent act would be
 16  1 a forcible felony if committed by an adult, the intake or
 16  2 juvenile court officer shall provide notification to the victim
 16  3 as required by Code section 915.24.
 16  4    SEALING OF JUVENILE COURT RECORDS UNAVAILABLE FOR
 16  5 OPERATING=WHILE=INTOXICATED VIOLATIONS.  Under current Code
 16  6 section 232.150, a court shall order juvenile court records
 16  7 to be sealed if the person who is the subject of the juvenile
 16  8 court records is 18 years of age or older and 2 years have
 16  9 elapsed since the last official action in the person's case,
 16 10 the person has not been subsequently convicted of a felony
 16 11 or an aggravated or serious misdemeanor or adjudicated a
 16 12 delinquent child for an act which if committed by an adult
 16 13 would be a felony, an aggravated misdemeanor, or a serious
 16 14 misdemeanor and no proceeding is pending seeking such
 16 15 conviction or adjudication, and the person was not placed on
 16 16 youthful offender status, transferred back to district court
 16 17 after the youthful offender's 18th birthday, and sentenced for
 16 18 the offense which precipitated the youthful offender placement.
 16 19 The bill in newly designated Code section 232.150(4) provides
 16 20 that the court shall not seal a person's juvenile court records
 16 21 if the person was adjudicated delinquent for violating Code
 16 22 section 321J.2, which prohibits the operation of a motor
 16 23 vehicle while under the influence of alcohol or a drug.
 16 24    RELEASE OF CONFIDENTIAL RECORDS.  The bill provides that a
 16 25 public record which is confidential under the provisions of
 16 26 Code chapter 232 shall only be subject to release upon order of
 16 27 a court in a proceeding under Code chapter 232.
 16 28    EXISTING CONFIDENTIALITY EXEMPTIONS.  The bill retains
 16 29 certain existing exemptions to confidentiality of juvenile
 16 30 court records. Pursuant to Code section 692A.121(8), records
 16 31 concerning sex offense convictions which are committed by
 16 32 minors may be released in the same manner as records of
 16 33 convictions of adults. Pursuant to Code section 915.10A,
 16 34 information concerning a juvenile charged with a felony offense
 16 35 may be released pursuant to an automated victim notification
 17  1 system. Under the bill, these exemptions to confidentiality
 17  2 are not amended and therefore still apply to juvenile court
 17  3 records.
 17  4    RIGHT TO COUNSEL.  The bill in Code section 232.11 provides
 17  5 that a child has the right to be represented by counsel at a
 17  6 hearing on a confidentiality order under Code section 232.149A
 17  7 or a public records order under Code section 232.149B.
 17  8    APPLICABILITY.  The bill applies to juvenile delinquency
 17  9 proceedings which are pending or arise on or after July 1,
 17 10 2016.

 12 16 center for the purposes stated in Code section 216A.136; a
 12 17 state or local law enforcement agency; and the alleged victim
 12 18 of any delinquent act in the proceeding.
 12 19    The bill in newly designated Code section 232.147(3A)
 12 20 provides that juvenile court records containing a petition or
 12 21 complaint alleging the commission of a delinquent act that
 12 22 would be a forcible felony if committed by an adult shall be
 12 23 public records unless subject to a confidentiality order under
 12 24 Code section 232.149A or a sealing order under Code section
 12 25 232.150.  However, the bill provides that such official records
 12 26 shall not be available to the public or any governmental
 12 27 agency through the internet or in an electronic customized
 12 28 data report unless the child has been adjudicated delinquent
 12 29 in the matter.  Nevertheless, the bill provides that official
 12 30 juvenile court records may be disclosed without a court order
 12 31 through the internet or in an electronic customized data
 12 32 report prior to the child being adjudicated delinquent to the
 12 33 judge and professional court staff, including juvenile court
 12 34 officers; the child's counsel or guardian ad litem; the county
 12 35 attorney and the county attorney's assistants; a court, court
 13  1 professional staff, and adult probation officers in connection
 13  2 with the preparation of a presentence report concerning a

 13  4 court proceeding; a state or local law enforcement agency; the

 13  6 the purposes stated in Code section 216A.136; the department
 13  7 of human services; the department of corrections; a judicial
 13  8 district department of correctional services; and the board of
 13  9 parole.
 13 10    CONFIDENTIALITY OF TRANSCRIPTS.  The bill in newly
 13 11 designated Code section 232.147(3B) provides that if the court
 13 12 has excluded the public from a hearing pursuant to Code section
 13 13 232.39 or 232.92, the transcript of the proceedings shall not
 13 14 be deemed a public record and inspection and disclosure of
 13 15 the contents of the transcript shall not be permitted except
 13 16 pursuant to a court order or unless otherwise provided in Code
 13 17 chapter 232.
 13 18    USE OF ADJUDICATION OF DELINQUENCY FOR PENALTY ENHANCEMENTS
 13 19 OR EVIDENCE.  The bill in newly designated Code section
 13 20 232.147(13) provides that the confidentiality of a final
 13 21 adjudication of delinquency under Code section 232.147 or
 13 22 pursuant to Code section 232.149A shall not prohibit the state
 13 23 from pleading or proving the adjudication at a subsequent
 13 24 criminal or delinquency proceeding for the purpose of penalty
 13 25 enhancement when a provision of the Code specifically deems the
 13 26 delinquency adjudication to constitute a final conviction.
 13 27    The bill in newly designated Code section 232.147(14)
 13 28 provides that the provisions of the bill shall not be construed
 13 29 to limit or restrict the production, use, or introduction
 13 30 of official juvenile court records in any juvenile or adult
 13 31 criminal proceeding, where such records are relevant and deemed
 13 32 admissible under any other provision of the law.
 13 33    CONFIDENTIALITY OF RECORDS AND FILES OF CRIMINAL OR
 13 34 JUVENILE JUSTICE AGENCIES.  Under current law, records and
 13 35 files of a criminal or juvenile justice agency concerning
 14  1 a child involved in a delinquent act are public records,
 14  2 subject to certain exceptions. The bill in Code section
 14  3 232.149 provides that the records and files of a criminal or
 14  4 juvenile justice agency, an intake officer, or a juvenile court
 14  5 officer concerning a child involved in a delinquent act are
 14  6 confidential. The bill further provides that the records of an
 14  7 intake officer or juvenile court officer containing a dismissal
 14  8 of a complaint or an informal adjustment of a complaint when
 14  9 no petition is filed relating to the complaint, shall not be
 14 10 available to the public, but may be disclosed to the judge and
 14 11 professional court staff, including juvenile court officers;
 14 12 the child's counsel or guardian ad litem; the county attorney
 14 13 and county attorney's assistants;  the superintendent or the
 14 14 superintendent's designee of the school district for the
 14 15 school attended by the child or the authorities in charge of

 14 17 of the armed forces of the United States who is conducting a
 14 18 background investigation of an individual pursuant to federal
 14 19 law; the statistical analysis center for the purposes stated
 14 20 in Code section 216A.136; the state public defender;  the
 14 21 department of human services; and the alleged victim of the
 14 22 delinquent act.
 14 23    PUBLIC RECORDS HEARINGS.  The bill enacts new Code section
 14 24 232.149B, which provides that a person may apply for a court
 14 25 order to make confidential juvenile court records public.
 14 26 The bill provides that a rebuttable presumption exists that
 14 27 official juvenile court records shall remain confidential. The
 14 28 bill provides that the court shall order the official juvenile
 14 29 court records in such a delinquency proceeding to be public
 14 30 records if either the public's interest in making the records
 14 31 public outweighs the juvenile's interest in maintaining the
 14 32 confidentiality of the records or the juvenile has been placed
 14 33 on youthful offender status pursuant to Code section 232.45(7)
 14 34 and Code section 907.3A(1), and will be transferred back to
 14 35 the district court for sentencing prior to the child's 18th
 15  1 birthday. The court may order the official juvenile court
 15  2 records in such a delinquency proceeding to be public records
 15  3 if the juvenile has been subsequently adjudicated delinquent
 15  4 for a public offense that would be a serious misdemeanor,
 15  5 aggravated misdemeanor, or felony offense if committed by an
 15  6 adult, or another delinquency proceeding is pending seeking
 15  7 such an adjudication. The bill provides that records subject
 15  8 to a public records order may be sealed at a later date
 15  9 pursuant to Code section 232.150.
 15 10    RIGHT TO REVIEW AND RELEASE A CONFIDENTIAL COMPLAINT.  The
 15 11 bill provides that delinquency complaints shall be released
 15 12 in accordance with Code section 915.25. Under current Code
 15 13 section 915.25, a complaint which alleges that a child who is
 15 14 at least 10 years of age committed a delinquent act, which if
 15 15 committed by an adult would be a public offense, is a public
 15 16 record. Current Code section 915.25 authorizes the court,
 15 17 its designee, or law enforcement officials to release such
 15 18 a complaint, including the identity of the child. The bill
 15 19 amends Code section 915.25 to provide that such a complaint
 15 20 is confidential unless the complaint alleges that the child
 15 21 committed a delinquent act that if committed by an adult would
 15 22 be a forcible felony. However, the bill authorizes state and
 15 23 local enforcement officials to release a confidential complaint
 15 24 against a child if the child is at large and doing so is deemed
 15 25 necessary for the protection of the public or the safety of
 15 26 the child. If the complaint is not confidential because the
 15 27 alleged delinquent act is an act that would be a forcible
 15 28 felony if committed by an adult, the court, its designee,
 15 29 or law enforcement officials may release such a complaint,
 15 30 including the identity of the child.
 15 31    The bill provides that an intake or juvenile court officer
 15 32 shall disclose to the alleged victim of a delinquent act, upon
 15 33 request, the complaint, the name and address of the child who
 15 34 allegedly committed the delinquent act, and the disposition
 15 35 of the complaint. If the alleged delinquent act would be
 16  1 a forcible felony if committed by an adult, the intake or
 16  2 juvenile court officer shall provide notification to the victim
 16  3 as required by Code section 915.24.
 16  4    SEALING OF JUVENILE COURT RECORDS UNAVAILABLE FOR
 16  5 OPERATING=WHILE=INTOXICATED VIOLATIONS.  Under current Code
 16  6 section 232.150, a court shall order juvenile court records
 16  7 to be sealed if the person who is the subject of the juvenile
 16  8 court records is 18 years of age or older and 2 years have
 16  9 elapsed since the last official action in the person's case,
 16 10 the person has not been subsequently convicted of a felony
 16 11 or an aggravated or serious misdemeanor or adjudicated a
 16 12 delinquent child for an act which if committed by an adult
 16 13 would be a felony, an aggravated misdemeanor, or a serious
 16 14 misdemeanor and no proceeding is pending seeking such
 16 15 conviction or adjudication, and the person was not placed on
 16 16 youthful offender status, transferred back to district court
 16 17 after the youthful offender's 18th birthday, and sentenced for
 16 18 the offense which precipitated the youthful offender placement.
 16 19 The bill in newly designated Code section 232.150(4) provides
 16 20 that the court shall not seal a person's juvenile court records
 16 21 if the person was adjudicated delinquent for violating Code
 16 22 section 321J.2, which prohibits the operation of a motor
 16 23 vehicle while under the influence of alcohol or a drug.
 16 24    RELEASE OF CONFIDENTIAL RECORDS.  The bill provides that a
 16 25 public record which is confidential under the provisions of
 16 26 Code chapter 232 shall only be subject to release upon order of
 16 27 a court in a proceeding under Code chapter 232.
 16 28    EXISTING CONFIDENTIALITY EXEMPTIONS.  The bill retains
 16 29 certain existing exemptions to confidentiality of juvenile
 16 30 court records. Pursuant to Code section 692A.121(8), records
 16 31 concerning sex offense convictions which are committed by
 16 32 minors may be released in the same manner as records of
 16 33 convictions of adults. Pursuant to Code section 915.10A,
 16 34 information concerning a juvenile charged with a felony offense
 16 35 may be released pursuant to an automated victim notification
 17  1 system. Under the bill, these exemptions to confidentiality
 17  2 are not amended and therefore still apply to juvenile court
 17  3 records.
 17  4    RIGHT TO COUNSEL.  The bill in Code section 232.11 provides
 17  5 that a child has the right to be represented by counsel at a
 17  6 hearing on a confidentiality order under Code section 232.149A
 17  7 or a public records order under Code section 232.149B.

 12 18 of any delinquent act in the proceeding.
 12 19    The bill in newly designated Code section 232.147(3A)
 12 20 provides that juvenile court records containing a petition or
 12 21 complaint alleging the commission of a delinquent act that
 12 22 would be a forcible felony if committed by an adult shall be
 12 23 public records unless subject to a confidentiality order under
 12 24 Code section 232.149A or a sealing order under Code section
 12 25 232.150.  However, the bill provides that such official records
 12 26 shall not be available to the public or any governmental
 12 27 agency through the internet or in an electronic customized
 12 28 data report unless the child has been adjudicated delinquent
 12 29 in the matter.  Nevertheless, the bill provides that official
 12 30 juvenile court records may be disclosed without a court order
 12 31 through the internet or in an electronic customized data
 12 32 report prior to the child being adjudicated delinquent to the
 12 33 judge and professional court staff, including juvenile court

 13  9 parole.
 13 10    CONFIDENTIALITY OF TRANSCRIPTS.  The bill in newly
 13 11 designated Code section 232.147(3B) provides that if the court
 13 12 has excluded the public from a hearing pursuant to Code section
 13 13 232.39 or 232.92, the transcript of the proceedings shall not
 13 14 be deemed a public record and inspection and disclosure of
 13 15 the contents of the transcript shall not be permitted except
 13 16 pursuant to a court order or unless otherwise provided in Code
 13 17 chapter 232.
 13 18    USE OF ADJUDICATION OF DELINQUENCY FOR PENALTY ENHANCEMENTS
 13 19 OR EVIDENCE.  The bill in newly designated Code section
 13 20 232.147(13) provides that the confidentiality of a final
 13 21 adjudication of delinquency under Code section 232.147 or
 13 22 pursuant to Code section 232.149A shall not prohibit the state
 13 23 from pleading or proving the adjudication at a subsequent
 13 24 criminal or delinquency proceeding for the purpose of penalty
 13 25 enhancement when a provision of the Code specifically deems the
 13 26 delinquency adjudication to constitute a final conviction.
 13 27    The bill in newly designated Code section 232.147(14)
 13 28 provides that the provisions of the bill shall not be construed
 13 29 to limit or restrict the production, use, or introduction
 13 30 of official juvenile court records in any juvenile or adult
 13 31 criminal proceeding, where such records are relevant and deemed
 13 32 admissible under any other provision of the law.
 13 33    CONFIDENTIALITY OF RECORDS AND FILES OF CRIMINAL OR
 13 34 JUVENILE JUSTICE AGENCIES.  Under current law, records and
 13 35 files of a criminal or juvenile justice agency concerning
 14  1 a child involved in a delinquent act are public records,
 14  2 subject to certain exceptions. The bill in Code section
 14  3 232.149 provides that the records and files of a criminal or
 14  4 juvenile justice agency, an intake officer, or a juvenile court
 14  5 officer concerning a child involved in a delinquent act are
 14  6 confidential. The bill further provides that the records of an
 14  7 intake officer or juvenile court officer containing a dismissal
 14  8 of a complaint or an informal adjustment of a complaint when
 14  9 no petition is filed relating to the complaint, shall not be
 14 10 available to the public, but may be disclosed to the judge and

 14 12 the child's counsel or guardian ad litem; the county attorney
 14 13 and county attorney's assistants;  the superintendent or the

 14 21 department of human services; and the alleged victim of the
 14 22 delinquent act.
 14 23    PUBLIC RECORDS HEARINGS.  The bill enacts new Code section
 14 24 232.149B, which provides that a person may apply for a court
 14 25 order to make confidential juvenile court records public.
 14 26 The bill provides that a rebuttable presumption exists that
 14 27 official juvenile court records shall remain confidential. The
 14 28 bill provides that the court shall order the official juvenile
 14 29 court records in such a delinquency proceeding to be public
 14 30 records if either the public's interest in making the records
 14 31 public outweighs the juvenile's interest in maintaining the
 14 32 confidentiality of the records or the juvenile has been placed
 14 33 on youthful offender status pursuant to Code section 232.45(7)
 14 34 and Code section 907.3A(1), and will be transferred back to
 14 35 the district court for sentencing prior to the child's 18th
 15  1 birthday. The court may order the official juvenile court
 15  2 records in such a delinquency proceeding to be public records
 15  3 if the juvenile has been subsequently adjudicated delinquent
 15  4 for a public offense that would be a serious misdemeanor,
 15  5 aggravated misdemeanor, or felony offense if committed by an
 15  6 adult, or another delinquency proceeding is pending seeking
 15  7 such an adjudication. The bill provides that records subject
 15  8 to a public records order may be sealed at a later date
 15  9 pursuant to Code section 232.150.
 15 10    RIGHT TO REVIEW AND RELEASE A CONFIDENTIAL COMPLAINT.  The
 15 11 bill provides that delinquency complaints shall be released
 15 12 in accordance with Code section 915.25. Under current Code
 15 13 section 915.25, a complaint which alleges that a child who is
 15 14 at least 10 years of age committed a delinquent act, which if
 15 15 committed by an adult would be a public offense, is a public
 15 16 record. Current Code section 915.25 authorizes the court,
 15 17 its designee, or law enforcement officials to release such
 15 18 a complaint, including the identity of the child. The bill
 15 19 amends Code section 915.25 to provide that such a complaint
 15 20 is confidential unless the complaint alleges that the child
 15 21 committed a delinquent act that if committed by an adult would
 15 22 be a forcible felony. However, the bill authorizes state and
 15 23 local enforcement officials to release a confidential complaint
 15 24 against a child if the child is at large and doing so is deemed
 15 25 necessary for the protection of the public or the safety of
 15 26 the child. If the complaint is not confidential because the
 15 27 alleged delinquent act is an act that would be a forcible
 15 28 felony if committed by an adult, the court, its designee,
 15 29 or law enforcement officials may release such a complaint,
 15 30 including the identity of the child.
 15 31    The bill provides that an intake or juvenile court officer
 15 32 shall disclose to the alleged victim of a delinquent act, upon
 15 33 request, the complaint, the name and address of the child who
 15 34 allegedly committed the delinquent act, and the disposition
 15 35 of the complaint. If the alleged delinquent act would be
 16  1 a forcible felony if committed by an adult, the intake or
 16  2 juvenile court officer shall provide notification to the victim
 16  3 as required by Code section 915.24.
 16  4    SEALING OF JUVENILE COURT RECORDS UNAVAILABLE FOR
 16  5 OPERATING=WHILE=INTOXICATED VIOLATIONS.  Under current Code
 16  6 section 232.150, a court shall order juvenile court records
 16  7 to be sealed if the person who is the subject of the juvenile
 16  8 court records is 18 years of age or older and 2 years have
 16  9 elapsed since the last official action in the person's case,
 16 10 the person has not been subsequently convicted of a felony
 16 11 or an aggravated or serious misdemeanor or adjudicated a
 16 12 delinquent child for an act which if committed by an adult
 16 13 would be a felony, an aggravated misdemeanor, or a serious
 16 14 misdemeanor and no proceeding is pending seeking such
 16 15 conviction or adjudication, and the person was not placed on
 16 16 youthful offender status, transferred back to district court
 16 17 after the youthful offender's 18th birthday, and sentenced for
 16 18 the offense which precipitated the youthful offender placement.
 16 19 The bill in newly designated Code section 232.150(4) provides
 16 20 that the court shall not seal a person's juvenile court records
 16 21 if the person was adjudicated delinquent for violating Code
 16 22 section 321J.2, which prohibits the operation of a motor
 16 23 vehicle while under the influence of alcohol or a drug.
 16 24    RELEASE OF CONFIDENTIAL RECORDS.  The bill provides that a
 16 25 public record which is confidential under the provisions of
 16 26 Code chapter 232 shall only be subject to release upon order of
 16 27 a court in a proceeding under Code chapter 232.
 16 28    EXISTING CONFIDENTIALITY EXEMPTIONS.  The bill retains
 16 29 certain existing exemptions to confidentiality of juvenile
 16 30 court records. Pursuant to Code section 692A.121(8), records
 16 31 concerning sex offense convictions which are committed by
 16 32 minors may be released in the same manner as records of
 16 33 convictions of adults. Pursuant to Code section 915.10A,
 16 34 information concerning a juvenile charged with a felony offense
 16 35 may be released pursuant to an automated victim notification
 17  1 system. Under the bill, these exemptions to confidentiality
 17  2 are not amended and therefore still apply to juvenile court
 17  3 records.
 17  4    RIGHT TO COUNSEL.  The bill in Code section 232.11 provides
 17  5 that a child has the right to be represented by counsel at a
 17  6 hearing on a confidentiality order under Code section 232.149A
 17  7 or a public records order under Code section 232.149B.
 17  8    APPLICABILITY.  The bill applies to juvenile delinquency
 17  9 proceedings which are pending or arise on or after July 1,
 17 10 2016.

 12 17 state or local law enforcement agency; and the alleged victim
 12 18 of any delinquent act in the proceeding.
 12 19    The bill in newly designated Code section 232.147(3A)
 12 20 provides that juvenile court records containing a petition or
 12 21 complaint alleging the commission of a delinquent act that
 12 22 would be a forcible felony if committed by an adult shall be
 12 23 public records unless subject to a confidentiality order under
 12 24 Code section 232.149A or a sealing order under Code section
 12 25 232.150.  However, the bill provides that such official records
 12 26 shall not be available to the public or any governmental
 12 27 agency through the internet or in an electronic customized
 12 28 data report unless the child has been adjudicated delinquent
 12 29 in the matter.  Nevertheless, the bill provides that official
 12 30 juvenile court records may be disclosed without a court order
 12 31 through the internet or in an electronic customized data
 12 32 report prior to the child being adjudicated delinquent to the
 12 33 judge and professional court staff, including juvenile court
 12 34 officers; the child's counsel or guardian ad litem; the county
 12 35 attorney and the county attorney's assistants; a court, court
 13  1 professional staff, and adult probation officers in connection
 13  2 with the preparation of a presentence report concerning a
 13  3 person who prior thereto had been the subject of a juvenile
 13  4 court proceeding; a state or local law enforcement agency; the

 13  7 of human services; the department of corrections; a judicial
 13  8 district department of correctional services; and the board of
 13  9 parole.
 13 10    CONFIDENTIALITY OF TRANSCRIPTS.  The bill in newly
 13 11 designated Code section 232.147(3B) provides that if the court
 13 12 has excluded the public from a hearing pursuant to Code section
 13 13 232.39 or 232.92, the transcript of the proceedings shall not
 13 14 be deemed a public record and inspection and disclosure of
 13 15 the contents of the transcript shall not be permitted except
 13 16 pursuant to a court order or unless otherwise provided in Code
 13 17 chapter 232.
 13 18    USE OF ADJUDICATION OF DELINQUENCY FOR PENALTY ENHANCEMENTS
 13 19 OR EVIDENCE.  The bill in newly designated Code section
 13 20 232.147(13) provides that the confidentiality of a final
 13 21 adjudication of delinquency under Code section 232.147 or
 13 22 pursuant to Code section 232.149A shall not prohibit the state
 13 23 from pleading or proving the adjudication at a subsequent
 13 24 criminal or delinquency proceeding for the purpose of penalty
 13 25 enhancement when a provision of the Code specifically deems the
 13 26 delinquency adjudication to constitute a final conviction.
 13 27    The bill in newly designated Code section 232.147(14)
 13 28 provides that the provisions of the bill shall not be construed
 13 29 to limit or restrict the production, use, or introduction
 13 30 of official juvenile court records in any juvenile or adult
 13 31 criminal proceeding, where such records are relevant and deemed
 13 32 admissible under any other provision of the law.
 13 33    CONFIDENTIALITY OF RECORDS AND FILES OF CRIMINAL OR
 13 34 JUVENILE JUSTICE AGENCIES.  Under current law, records and
 13 35 files of a criminal or juvenile justice agency concerning
 14  1 a child involved in a delinquent act are public records,
 14  2 subject to certain exceptions. The bill in Code section
 14  3 232.149 provides that the records and files of a criminal or
 14  4 juvenile justice agency, an intake officer, or a juvenile court
 14  5 officer concerning a child involved in a delinquent act are
 14  6 confidential. The bill further provides that the records of an
 14  7 intake officer or juvenile court officer containing a dismissal
 14  8 of a complaint or an informal adjustment of a complaint when
 14  9 no petition is filed relating to the complaint, shall not be
 14 10 available to the public, but may be disclosed to the judge and
 14 11 professional court staff, including juvenile court officers;
 14 12 the child's counsel or guardian ad litem; the county attorney
 14 13 and county attorney's assistants;  the superintendent or the
 14 14 superintendent's designee of the school district for the
 14 15 school attended by the child or the authorities in charge of
 14 16 an accredited nonpublic school attended by the child; a member
 14 17 of the armed forces of the United States who is conducting a
 14 18 background investigation of an individual pursuant to federal
 14 19 law; the statistical analysis center for the purposes stated
 14 20 in Code section 216A.136; the state public defender;  the
 14 21 department of human services; and the alleged victim of the
 14 22 delinquent act.
 14 23    PUBLIC RECORDS HEARINGS.  The bill enacts new Code section
 14 24 232.149B, which provides that a person may apply for a court
 14 25 order to make confidential juvenile court records public.
 14 26 The bill provides that a rebuttable presumption exists that
 14 27 official juvenile court records shall remain confidential. The
 14 28 bill provides that the court shall order the official juvenile
 14 29 court records in such a delinquency proceeding to be public
 14 30 records if either the public's interest in making the records
 14 31 public outweighs the juvenile's interest in maintaining the
 14 32 confidentiality of the records or the juvenile has been placed
 14 33 on youthful offender status pursuant to Code section 232.45(7)
 14 34 and Code section 907.3A(1), and will be transferred back to
 14 35 the district court for sentencing prior to the child's 18th
 15  1 birthday. The court may order the official juvenile court
 15  2 records in such a delinquency proceeding to be public records
 15  3 if the juvenile has been subsequently adjudicated delinquent
 15  4 for a public offense that would be a serious misdemeanor,
 15  5 aggravated misdemeanor, or felony offense if committed by an
 15  6 adult, or another delinquency proceeding is pending seeking
 15  7 such an adjudication. The bill provides that records subject
 15  8 to a public records order may be sealed at a later date
 15  9 pursuant to Code section 232.150.
 15 10    RIGHT TO REVIEW AND RELEASE A CONFIDENTIAL COMPLAINT.  The
 15 11 bill provides that delinquency complaints shall be released
 15 12 in accordance with Code section 915.25. Under current Code
 15 13 section 915.25, a complaint which alleges that a child who is
 15 14 at least 10 years of age committed a delinquent act, which if
 15 15 committed by an adult would be a public offense, is a public
 15 16 record. Current Code section 915.25 authorizes the court,
 15 17 its designee, or law enforcement officials to release such
 15 18 a complaint, including the identity of the child. The bill
 15 19 amends Code section 915.25 to provide that such a complaint
 15 20 is confidential unless the complaint alleges that the child
 15 21 committed a delinquent act that if committed by an adult would
 15 22 be a forcible felony. However, the bill authorizes state and
 15 23 local enforcement officials to release a confidential complaint
 15 24 against a child if the child is at large and doing so is deemed
 15 25 necessary for the protection of the public or the safety of
 15 26 the child. If the complaint is not confidential because the
 15 27 alleged delinquent act is an act that would be a forcible
 15 28 felony if committed by an adult, the court, its designee,
 15 29 or law enforcement officials may release such a complaint,
 15 30 including the identity of the child.
 15 31    The bill provides that an intake or juvenile court officer
 15 32 shall disclose to the alleged victim of a delinquent act, upon
 15 33 request, the complaint, the name and address of the child who
 15 34 allegedly committed the delinquent act, and the disposition
 15 35 of the complaint. If the alleged delinquent act would be
 16  1 a forcible felony if committed by an adult, the intake or
 16  2 juvenile court officer shall provide notification to the victim
 16  3 as required by Code section 915.24.
 16  4    SEALING OF JUVENILE COURT RECORDS UNAVAILABLE FOR
 16  5 OPERATING=WHILE=INTOXICATED VIOLATIONS.  Under current Code
 16  6 section 232.150, a court shall order juvenile court records
 16  7 to be sealed if the person who is the subject of the juvenile
 16  8 court records is 18 years of age or older and 2 years have
 16  9 elapsed since the last official action in the person's case,
 16 10 the person has not been subsequently convicted of a felony
 16 11 or an aggravated or serious misdemeanor or adjudicated a
 16 12 delinquent child for an act which if committed by an adult
 16 13 would be a felony, an aggravated misdemeanor, or a serious
 16 14 misdemeanor and no proceeding is pending seeking such
 16 15 conviction or adjudication, and the person was not placed on
 16 16 youthful offender status, transferred back to district court
 16 17 after the youthful offender's 18th birthday, and sentenced for
 16 18 the offense which precipitated the youthful offender placement.
 16 19 The bill in newly designated Code section 232.150(4) provides
 16 20 that the court shall not seal a person's juvenile court records
 16 21 if the person was adjudicated delinquent for violating Code
 16 22 section 321J.2, which prohibits the operation of a motor
 16 23 vehicle while under the influence of alcohol or a drug.
 16 24    RELEASE OF CONFIDENTIAL RECORDS.  The bill provides that a
 16 25 public record which is confidential under the provisions of
 16 26 Code chapter 232 shall only be subject to release upon order of
 16 27 a court in a proceeding under Code chapter 232.
 16 28    EXISTING CONFIDENTIALITY EXEMPTIONS.  The bill retains
 16 29 certain existing exemptions to confidentiality of juvenile
 16 30 court records. Pursuant to Code section 692A.121(8), records
 16 31 concerning sex offense convictions which are committed by
 16 32 minors may be released in the same manner as records of
 16 33 convictions of adults. Pursuant to Code section 915.10A,
 16 34 information concerning a juvenile charged with a felony offense
 16 35 may be released pursuant to an automated victim notification
 17  1 system. Under the bill, these exemptions to confidentiality
 17  2 are not amended and therefore still apply to juvenile court
 17  3 records.
 17  4    RIGHT TO COUNSEL.  The bill in Code section 232.11 provides
 17  5 that a child has the right to be represented by counsel at a
 17  6 hearing on a confidentiality order under Code section 232.149A
 17  7 or a public records order under Code section 232.149B.
 17  8    APPLICABILITY.  The bill applies to juvenile delinquency
 17  9 proceedings which are pending or arise on or after July 1,

 12 19    The bill in newly designated Code section 232.147(3A)
 12 20 provides that juvenile court records containing a petition or
 12 21 complaint alleging the commission of a delinquent act that
 12 22 would be a forcible felony if committed by an adult shall be
 12 23 public records unless subject to a confidentiality order under
 12 24 Code section 232.149A or a sealing order under Code section
 12 25 232.150.  However, the bill provides that such official records
 12 26 shall not be available to the public or any governmental
 12 27 agency through the internet or in an electronic customized
 12 28 data report unless the child has been adjudicated delinquent
 12 29 in the matter.  Nevertheless, the bill provides that official
 12 30 juvenile court records may be disclosed without a court order
 12 31 through the internet or in an electronic customized data
 12 32 report prior to the child being adjudicated delinquent to the
 12 33 judge and professional court staff, including juvenile court
 12 34 officers; the child's counsel or guardian ad litem; the county
 12 35 attorney and the county attorney's assistants; a court, court

 13  7 of human services; the department of corrections; a judicial
 13  8 district department of correctional services; and the board of
 13  9 parole.
 13 10    CONFIDENTIALITY OF TRANSCRIPTS.  The bill in newly
 13 11 designated Code section 232.147(3B) provides that if the court
 13 12 has excluded the public from a hearing pursuant to Code section
 13 13 232.39 or 232.92, the transcript of the proceedings shall not
 13 14 be deemed a public record and inspection and disclosure of
 13 15 the contents of the transcript shall not be permitted except
 13 16 pursuant to a court order or unless otherwise provided in Code
 13 17 chapter 232.
 13 18    USE OF ADJUDICATION OF DELINQUENCY FOR PENALTY ENHANCEMENTS
 13 19 OR EVIDENCE.  The bill in newly designated Code section
 13 20 232.147(13) provides that the confidentiality of a final
 13 21 adjudication of delinquency under Code section 232.147 or
 13 22 pursuant to Code section 232.149A shall not prohibit the state
 13 23 from pleading or proving the adjudication at a subsequent
 13 24 criminal or delinquency proceeding for the purpose of penalty
 13 25 enhancement when a provision of the Code specifically deems the
 13 26 delinquency adjudication to constitute a final conviction.
 13 27    The bill in newly designated Code section 232.147(14)
 13 28 provides that the provisions of the bill shall not be construed
 13 29 to limit or restrict the production, use, or introduction
 13 30 of official juvenile court records in any juvenile or adult
 13 31 criminal proceeding, where such records are relevant and deemed
 13 32 admissible under any other provision of the law.
 13 33    CONFIDENTIALITY OF RECORDS AND FILES OF CRIMINAL OR
 13 34 JUVENILE JUSTICE AGENCIES.  Under current law, records and
 13 35 files of a criminal or juvenile justice agency concerning
 14  1 a child involved in a delinquent act are public records,
 14  2 subject to certain exceptions. The bill in Code section
 14  3 232.149 provides that the records and files of a criminal or
 14  4 juvenile justice agency, an intake officer, or a juvenile court
 14  5 officer concerning a child involved in a delinquent act are
 14  6 confidential. The bill further provides that the records of an
 14  7 intake officer or juvenile court officer containing a dismissal
 14  8 of a complaint or an informal adjustment of a complaint when
 14  9 no petition is filed relating to the complaint, shall not be
 14 10 available to the public, but may be disclosed to the judge and
 14 11 professional court staff, including juvenile court officers;
 14 12 the child's counsel or guardian ad litem; the county attorney
 14 13 and county attorney's assistants;  the superintendent or the
 14 14 superintendent's designee of the school district for the
 14 15 school attended by the child or the authorities in charge of

 14 17 of the armed forces of the United States who is conducting a

 14 20 in Code section 216A.136; the state public defender;  the
 14 21 department of human services; and the alleged victim of the
 14 22 delinquent act.
 14 23    PUBLIC RECORDS HEARINGS.  The bill enacts new Code section
 14 24 232.149B, which provides that a person may apply for a court
 14 25 order to make confidential juvenile court records public.
 14 26 The bill provides that a rebuttable presumption exists that
 14 27 official juvenile court records shall remain confidential. The
 14 28 bill provides that the court shall order the official juvenile
 14 29 court records in such a delinquency proceeding to be public
 14 30 records if either the public's interest in making the records
 14 31 public outweighs the juvenile's interest in maintaining the
 14 32 confidentiality of the records or the juvenile has been placed
 14 33 on youthful offender status pursuant to Code section 232.45(7)
 14 34 and Code section 907.3A(1), and will be transferred back to
 14 35 the district court for sentencing prior to the child's 18th
 15  1 birthday. The court may order the official juvenile court
 15  2 records in such a delinquency proceeding to be public records
 15  3 if the juvenile has been subsequently adjudicated delinquent
 15  4 for a public offense that would be a serious misdemeanor,
 15  5 aggravated misdemeanor, or felony offense if committed by an
 15  6 adult, or another delinquency proceeding is pending seeking
 15  7 such an adjudication. The bill provides that records subject
 15  8 to a public records order may be sealed at a later date
 15  9 pursuant to Code section 232.150.
 15 10    RIGHT TO REVIEW AND RELEASE A CONFIDENTIAL COMPLAINT.  The
 15 11 bill provides that delinquency complaints shall be released
 15 12 in accordance with Code section 915.25. Under current Code
 15 13 section 915.25, a complaint which alleges that a child who is
 15 14 at least 10 years of age committed a delinquent act, which if
 15 15 committed by an adult would be a public offense, is a public
 15 16 record. Current Code section 915.25 authorizes the court,
 15 17 its designee, or law enforcement officials to release such
 15 18 a complaint, including the identity of the child. The bill
 15 19 amends Code section 915.25 to provide that such a complaint
 15 20 is confidential unless the complaint alleges that the child
 15 21 committed a delinquent act that if committed by an adult would
 15 22 be a forcible felony. However, the bill authorizes state and
 15 23 local enforcement officials to release a confidential complaint
 15 24 against a child if the child is at large and doing so is deemed
 15 25 necessary for the protection of the public or the safety of
 15 26 the child. If the complaint is not confidential because the
 15 27 alleged delinquent act is an act that would be a forcible
 15 28 felony if committed by an adult, the court, its designee,
 15 29 or law enforcement officials may release such a complaint,
 15 30 including the identity of the child.
 15 31    The bill provides that an intake or juvenile court officer
 15 32 shall disclose to the alleged victim of a delinquent act, upon
 15 33 request, the complaint, the name and address of the child who
 15 34 allegedly committed the delinquent act, and the disposition
 15 35 of the complaint. If the alleged delinquent act would be
 16  1 a forcible felony if committed by an adult, the intake or
 16  2 juvenile court officer shall provide notification to the victim
 16  3 as required by Code section 915.24.
 16  4    SEALING OF JUVENILE COURT RECORDS UNAVAILABLE FOR
 16  5 OPERATING=WHILE=INTOXICATED VIOLATIONS.  Under current Code
 16  6 section 232.150, a court shall order juvenile court records
 16  7 to be sealed if the person who is the subject of the juvenile
 16  8 court records is 18 years of age or older and 2 years have
 16  9 elapsed since the last official action in the person's case,
 16 10 the person has not been subsequently convicted of a felony
 16 11 or an aggravated or serious misdemeanor or adjudicated a
 16 12 delinquent child for an act which if committed by an adult
 16 13 would be a felony, an aggravated misdemeanor, or a serious
 16 14 misdemeanor and no proceeding is pending seeking such
 16 15 conviction or adjudication, and the person was not placed on
 16 16 youthful offender status, transferred back to district court
 16 17 after the youthful offender's 18th birthday, and sentenced for
 16 18 the offense which precipitated the youthful offender placement.
 16 19 The bill in newly designated Code section 232.150(4) provides
 16 20 that the court shall not seal a person's juvenile court records
 16 21 if the person was adjudicated delinquent for violating Code
 16 22 section 321J.2, which prohibits the operation of a motor
 16 23 vehicle while under the influence of alcohol or a drug.
 16 24    RELEASE OF CONFIDENTIAL RECORDS.  The bill provides that a
 16 25 public record which is confidential under the provisions of
 16 26 Code chapter 232 shall only be subject to release upon order of
 16 27 a court in a proceeding under Code chapter 232.
 16 28    EXISTING CONFIDENTIALITY EXEMPTIONS.  The bill retains
 16 29 certain existing exemptions to confidentiality of juvenile
 16 30 court records. Pursuant to Code section 692A.121(8), records
 16 31 concerning sex offense convictions which are committed by
 16 32 minors may be released in the same manner as records of
 16 33 convictions of adults. Pursuant to Code section 915.10A,
 16 34 information concerning a juvenile charged with a felony offense
 16 35 may be released pursuant to an automated victim notification
 17  1 system. Under the bill, these exemptions to confidentiality
 17  2 are not amended and therefore still apply to juvenile court
 17  3 records.
 17  4    RIGHT TO COUNSEL.  The bill in Code section 232.11 provides
 17  5 that a child has the right to be represented by counsel at a
 17  6 hearing on a confidentiality order under Code section 232.149A
 17  7 or a public records order under Code section 232.149B.
 17  8    APPLICABILITY.  The bill applies to juvenile delinquency
 17  9 proceedings which are pending or arise on or after July 1,
 17 10 2016.

 12 18 of any delinquent act in the proceeding.
 12 19    The bill in newly designated Code section 232.147(3A)
 12 20 provides that juvenile court records containing a petition or
 12 21 complaint alleging the commission of a delinquent act that
 12 22 would be a forcible felony if committed by an adult shall be
 12 23 public records unless subject to a confidentiality order under
 12 24 Code section 232.149A or a sealing order under Code section
 12 25 232.150.  However, the bill provides that such official records
 12 26 shall not be available to the public or any governmental
 12 27 agency through the internet or in an electronic customized
 12 28 data report unless the child has been adjudicated delinquent
 12 29 in the matter.  Nevertheless, the bill provides that official
 12 30 juvenile court records may be disclosed without a court order
 12 31 through the internet or in an electronic customized data
 12 32 report prior to the child being adjudicated delinquent to the
 12 33 judge and professional court staff, including juvenile court

 13  9 parole.
 13 10    CONFIDENTIALITY OF TRANSCRIPTS.  The bill in newly
 13 11 designated Code section 232.147(3B) provides that if the court
 13 12 has excluded the public from a hearing pursuant to Code section
 13 13 232.39 or 232.92, the transcript of the proceedings shall not
 13 14 be deemed a public record and inspection and disclosure of
 13 15 the contents of the transcript shall not be permitted except
 13 16 pursuant to a court order or unless otherwise provided in Code
 13 17 chapter 232.
 13 18    USE OF ADJUDICATION OF DELINQUENCY FOR PENALTY ENHANCEMENTS
 13 19 OR EVIDENCE.  The bill in newly designated Code section
 13 20 232.147(13) provides that the confidentiality of a final
 13 21 adjudication of delinquency under Code section 232.147 or
 13 22 pursuant to Code section 232.149A shall not prohibit the state
 13 23 from pleading or proving the adjudication at a subsequent
 13 24 criminal or delinquency proceeding for the purpose of penalty
 13 25 enhancement when a provision of the Code specifically deems the
 13 26 delinquency adjudication to constitute a final conviction.
 13 27    The bill in newly designated Code section 232.147(14)
 13 28 provides that the provisions of the bill shall not be construed
 13 29 to limit or restrict the production, use, or introduction
 13 30 of official juvenile court records in any juvenile or adult
 13 31 criminal proceeding, where such records are relevant and deemed
 13 32 admissible under any other provision of the law.
 13 33    CONFIDENTIALITY OF RECORDS AND FILES OF CRIMINAL OR
 13 34 JUVENILE JUSTICE AGENCIES.  Under current law, records and
 13 35 files of a criminal or juvenile justice agency concerning
 14  1 a child involved in a delinquent act are public records,
 14  2 subject to certain exceptions. The bill in Code section
 14  3 232.149 provides that the records and files of a criminal or
 14  4 juvenile justice agency, an intake officer, or a juvenile court
 14  5 officer concerning a child involved in a delinquent act are
 14  6 confidential. The bill further provides that the records of an
 14  7 intake officer or juvenile court officer containing a dismissal
 14  8 of a complaint or an informal adjustment of a complaint when
 14  9 no petition is filed relating to the complaint, shall not be
 14 10 available to the public, but may be disclosed to the judge and
 14 11 professional court staff, including juvenile court officers;
 14 12 the child's counsel or guardian ad litem; the county attorney
 14 13 and county attorney's assistants;  the superintendent or the
 14 14 superintendent's designee of the school district for the
 14 15 school attended by the child or the authorities in charge of
 14 16 an accredited nonpublic school attended by the child; a member
 14 17 of the armed forces of the United States who is conducting a
 14 18 background investigation of an individual pursuant to federal
 14 19 law; the statistical analysis center for the purposes stated
 14 20 in Code section 216A.136; the state public defender;  the
 14 21 department of human services; and the alleged victim of the
 14 22 delinquent act.
 14 23    PUBLIC RECORDS HEARINGS.  The bill enacts new Code section
 14 24 232.149B, which provides that a person may apply for a court
 14 25 order to make confidential juvenile court records public.
 14 26 The bill provides that a rebuttable presumption exists that
 14 27 official juvenile court records shall remain confidential. The
 14 28 bill provides that the court shall order the official juvenile
 14 29 court records in such a delinquency proceeding to be public
 14 30 records if either the public's interest in making the records
 14 31 public outweighs the juvenile's interest in maintaining the
 14 32 confidentiality of the records or the juvenile has been placed
 14 33 on youthful offender status pursuant to Code section 232.45(7)
 14 34 and Code section 907.3A(1), and will be transferred back to
 14 35 the district court for sentencing prior to the child's 18th
 15  1 birthday. The court may order the official juvenile court
 15  2 records in such a delinquency proceeding to be public records
 15  3 if the juvenile has been subsequently adjudicated delinquent
 15  4 for a public offense that would be a serious misdemeanor,
 15  5 aggravated misdemeanor, or felony offense if committed by an
 15  6 adult, or another delinquency proceeding is pending seeking
 15  7 such an adjudication. The bill provides that records subject
 15  8 to a public records order may be sealed at a later date
 15  9 pursuant to Code section 232.150.
 15 10    RIGHT TO REVIEW AND RELEASE A CONFIDENTIAL COMPLAINT.  The
 15 11 bill provides that delinquency complaints shall be released
 15 12 in accordance with Code section 915.25. Under current Code
 15 13 section 915.25, a complaint which alleges that a child who is
 15 14 at least 10 years of age committed a delinquent act, which if
 15 15 committed by an adult would be a public offense, is a public
 15 16 record. Current Code section 915.25 authorizes the court,
 15 17 its designee, or law enforcement officials to release such
 15 18 a complaint, including the identity of the child. The bill
 15 19 amends Code section 915.25 to provide that such a complaint
 15 20 is confidential unless the complaint alleges that the child
 15 21 committed a delinquent act that if committed by an adult would
 15 22 be a forcible felony. However, the bill authorizes state and
 15 23 local enforcement officials to release a confidential complaint
 15 24 against a child if the child is at large and doing so is deemed
 15 25 necessary for the protection of the public or the safety of
 15 26 the child. If the complaint is not confidential because the
 15 27 alleged delinquent act is an act that would be a forcible
 15 28 felony if committed by an adult, the court, its designee,
 15 29 or law enforcement officials may release such a complaint,
 15 30 including the identity of the child.
 15 31    The bill provides that an intake or juvenile court officer
 15 32 shall disclose to the alleged victim of a delinquent act, upon
 15 33 request, the complaint, the name and address of the child who
 15 34 allegedly committed the delinquent act, and the disposition
 15 35 of the complaint. If the alleged delinquent act would be
 16  1 a forcible felony if committed by an adult, the intake or
 16  2 juvenile court officer shall provide notification to the victim
 16  3 as required by Code section 915.24.
 16  4    SEALING OF JUVENILE COURT RECORDS UNAVAILABLE FOR
 16  5 OPERATING=WHILE=INTOXICATED VIOLATIONS.  Under current Code
 16  6 section 232.150, a court shall order juvenile court records
 16  7 to be sealed if the person who is the subject of the juvenile
 16  8 court records is 18 years of age or older and 2 years have
 16  9 elapsed since the last official action in the person's case,
 16 10 the person has not been subsequently convicted of a felony
 16 11 or an aggravated or serious misdemeanor or adjudicated a
 16 12 delinquent child for an act which if committed by an adult
 16 13 would be a felony, an aggravated misdemeanor, or a serious
 16 14 misdemeanor and no proceeding is pending seeking such
 16 15 conviction or adjudication, and the person was not placed on
 16 16 youthful offender status, transferred back to district court
 16 17 after the youthful offender's 18th birthday, and sentenced for
 16 18 the offense which precipitated the youthful offender placement.
 16 19 The bill in newly designated Code section 232.150(4) provides
 16 20 that the court shall not seal a person's juvenile court records
 16 21 if the person was adjudicated delinquent for violating Code
 16 22 section 321J.2, which prohibits the operation of a motor
 16 23 vehicle while under the influence of alcohol or a drug.
 16 24    RELEASE OF CONFIDENTIAL RECORDS.  The bill provides that a
 16 25 public record which is confidential under the provisions of
 16 26 Code chapter 232 shall only be subject to release upon order of
 16 27 a court in a proceeding under Code chapter 232.
 16 28    EXISTING CONFIDENTIALITY EXEMPTIONS.  The bill retains
 16 29 certain existing exemptions to confidentiality of juvenile
 16 30 court records. Pursuant to Code section 692A.121(8), records
 16 31 concerning sex offense convictions which are committed by
 16 32 minors may be released in the same manner as records of
 16 33 convictions of adults. Pursuant to Code section 915.10A,
 16 34 information concerning a juvenile charged with a felony offense
 16 35 may be released pursuant to an automated victim notification
 17  1 system. Under the bill, these exemptions to confidentiality
 17  2 are not amended and therefore still apply to juvenile court
 17  3 records.
 17  4    RIGHT TO COUNSEL.  The bill in Code section 232.11 provides
 17  5 that a child has the right to be represented by counsel at a
 17  6 hearing on a confidentiality order under Code section 232.149A
 17  7 or a public records order under Code section 232.149B.
 17  8    APPLICABILITY.  The bill applies to juvenile delinquency
 17  9 proceedings which are pending or arise on or after July 1,

 12 20 provides that juvenile court records containing a petition or
 12 21 complaint alleging the commission of a delinquent act that
 12 22 would be a forcible felony if committed by an adult shall be
 12 23 public records unless subject to a confidentiality order under
 12 24 Code section 232.149A or a sealing order under Code section

 12 26 shall not be available to the public or any governmental
 12 27 agency through the internet or in an electronic customized
 12 28 data report unless the child has been adjudicated delinquent
 12 29 in the matter.  Nevertheless, the bill provides that official
 12 30 juvenile court records may be disclosed without a court order

 12 32 report prior to the child being adjudicated delinquent to the

 13 10    CONFIDENTIALITY OF TRANSCRIPTS.  The bill in newly
 13 11 designated Code section 232.147(3B) provides that if the court
 13 12 has excluded the public from a hearing pursuant to Code section
 13 13 232.39 or 232.92, the transcript of the proceedings shall not
 13 14 be deemed a public record and inspection and disclosure of
 13 15 the contents of the transcript shall not be permitted except
 13 16 pursuant to a court order or unless otherwise provided in Code
 13 17 chapter 232.
 13 18    USE OF ADJUDICATION OF DELINQUENCY FOR PENALTY ENHANCEMENTS
 13 19 OR EVIDENCE.  The bill in newly designated Code section
 13 20 232.147(13) provides that the confidentiality of a final
 13 21 adjudication of delinquency under Code section 232.147 or
 13 22 pursuant to Code section 232.149A shall not prohibit the state
 13 23 from pleading or proving the adjudication at a subsequent
 13 24 criminal or delinquency proceeding for the purpose of penalty
 13 25 enhancement when a provision of the Code specifically deems the
 13 26 delinquency adjudication to constitute a final conviction.
 13 27    The bill in newly designated Code section 232.147(14)
 13 28 provides that the provisions of the bill shall not be construed
 13 29 to limit or restrict the production, use, or introduction
 13 30 of official juvenile court records in any juvenile or adult
 13 31 criminal proceeding, where such records are relevant and deemed
 13 32 admissible under any other provision of the law.
 13 33    CONFIDENTIALITY OF RECORDS AND FILES OF CRIMINAL OR
 13 34 JUVENILE JUSTICE AGENCIES.  Under current law, records and
 13 35 files of a criminal or juvenile justice agency concerning
 14  1 a child involved in a delinquent act are public records,
 14  2 subject to certain exceptions. The bill in Code section
 14  3 232.149 provides that the records and files of a criminal or
 14  4 juvenile justice agency, an intake officer, or a juvenile court
 14  5 officer concerning a child involved in a delinquent act are
 14  6 confidential. The bill further provides that the records of an
 14  7 intake officer or juvenile court officer containing a dismissal
 14  8 of a complaint or an informal adjustment of a complaint when
 14  9 no petition is filed relating to the complaint, shall not be
 14 10 available to the public, but may be disclosed to the judge and
 14 11 professional court staff, including juvenile court officers;
 14 12 the child's counsel or guardian ad litem; the county attorney
 14 13 and county attorney's assistants;  the superintendent or the

 14 21 department of human services; and the alleged victim of the
 14 22 delinquent act.
 14 23    PUBLIC RECORDS HEARINGS.  The bill enacts new Code section
 14 24 232.149B, which provides that a person may apply for a court
 14 25 order to make confidential juvenile court records public.
 14 26 The bill provides that a rebuttable presumption exists that
 14 27 official juvenile court records shall remain confidential. The
 14 28 bill provides that the court shall order the official juvenile
 14 29 court records in such a delinquency proceeding to be public
 14 30 records if either the public's interest in making the records
 14 31 public outweighs the juvenile's interest in maintaining the
 14 32 confidentiality of the records or the juvenile has been placed
 14 33 on youthful offender status pursuant to Code section 232.45(7)
 14 34 and Code section 907.3A(1), and will be transferred back to
 14 35 the district court for sentencing prior to the child's 18th
 15  1 birthday. The court may order the official juvenile court
 15  2 records in such a delinquency proceeding to be public records
 15  3 if the juvenile has been subsequently adjudicated delinquent
 15  4 for a public offense that would be a serious misdemeanor,
 15  5 aggravated misdemeanor, or felony offense if committed by an
 15  6 adult, or another delinquency proceeding is pending seeking
 15  7 such an adjudication. The bill provides that records subject
 15  8 to a public records order may be sealed at a later date
 15  9 pursuant to Code section 232.150.
 15 10    RIGHT TO REVIEW AND RELEASE A CONFIDENTIAL COMPLAINT.  The
 15 11 bill provides that delinquency complaints shall be released
 15 12 in accordance with Code section 915.25. Under current Code
 15 13 section 915.25, a complaint which alleges that a child who is
 15 14 at least 10 years of age committed a delinquent act, which if
 15 15 committed by an adult would be a public offense, is a public
 15 16 record. Current Code section 915.25 authorizes the court,
 15 17 its designee, or law enforcement officials to release such
 15 18 a complaint, including the identity of the child. The bill
 15 19 amends Code section 915.25 to provide that such a complaint
 15 20 is confidential unless the complaint alleges that the child
 15 21 committed a delinquent act that if committed by an adult would
 15 22 be a forcible felony. However, the bill authorizes state and
 15 23 local enforcement officials to release a confidential complaint
 15 24 against a child if the child is at large and doing so is deemed
 15 25 necessary for the protection of the public or the safety of
 15 26 the child. If the complaint is not confidential because the
 15 27 alleged delinquent act is an act that would be a forcible
 15 28 felony if committed by an adult, the court, its designee,
 15 29 or law enforcement officials may release such a complaint,
 15 30 including the identity of the child.
 15 31    The bill provides that an intake or juvenile court officer
 15 32 shall disclose to the alleged victim of a delinquent act, upon
 15 33 request, the complaint, the name and address of the child who
 15 34 allegedly committed the delinquent act, and the disposition
 15 35 of the complaint. If the alleged delinquent act would be
 16  1 a forcible felony if committed by an adult, the intake or
 16  2 juvenile court officer shall provide notification to the victim
 16  3 as required by Code section 915.24.
 16  4    SEALING OF JUVENILE COURT RECORDS UNAVAILABLE FOR
 16  5 OPERATING=WHILE=INTOXICATED VIOLATIONS.  Under current Code
 16  6 section 232.150, a court shall order juvenile court records
 16  7 to be sealed if the person who is the subject of the juvenile
 16  8 court records is 18 years of age or older and 2 years have
 16  9 elapsed since the last official action in the person's case,
 16 10 the person has not been subsequently convicted of a felony
 16 11 or an aggravated or serious misdemeanor or adjudicated a
 16 12 delinquent child for an act which if committed by an adult
 16 13 would be a felony, an aggravated misdemeanor, or a serious
 16 14 misdemeanor and no proceeding is pending seeking such
 16 15 conviction or adjudication, and the person was not placed on
 16 16 youthful offender status, transferred back to district court
 16 17 after the youthful offender's 18th birthday, and sentenced for
 16 18 the offense which precipitated the youthful offender placement.
 16 19 The bill in newly designated Code section 232.150(4) provides
 16 20 that the court shall not seal a person's juvenile court records
 16 21 if the person was adjudicated delinquent for violating Code
 16 22 section 321J.2, which prohibits the operation of a motor
 16 23 vehicle while under the influence of alcohol or a drug.
 16 24    RELEASE OF CONFIDENTIAL RECORDS.  The bill provides that a
 16 25 public record which is confidential under the provisions of
 16 26 Code chapter 232 shall only be subject to release upon order of
 16 27 a court in a proceeding under Code chapter 232.
 16 28    EXISTING CONFIDENTIALITY EXEMPTIONS.  The bill retains
 16 29 certain existing exemptions to confidentiality of juvenile
 16 30 court records. Pursuant to Code section 692A.121(8), records
 16 31 concerning sex offense convictions which are committed by
 16 32 minors may be released in the same manner as records of
 16 33 convictions of adults. Pursuant to Code section 915.10A,
 16 34 information concerning a juvenile charged with a felony offense
 16 35 may be released pursuant to an automated victim notification
 17  1 system. Under the bill, these exemptions to confidentiality
 17  2 are not amended and therefore still apply to juvenile court
 17  3 records.
 17  4    RIGHT TO COUNSEL.  The bill in Code section 232.11 provides
 17  5 that a child has the right to be represented by counsel at a

 17  7 or a public records order under Code section 232.149B.
 17  8    APPLICABILITY.  The bill applies to juvenile delinquency

 12 20 provides that juvenile court records containing a petition or
 12 21 complaint alleging the commission of a delinquent act that
 12 22 would be a forcible felony if committed by an adult shall be
 12 23 public records unless subject to a confidentiality order under
 12 24 Code section 232.149A or a sealing order under Code section
 12 25 232.150.  However, the bill provides that such official records
 12 26 shall not be available to the public or any governmental
 12 27 agency through the internet or in an electronic customized
 12 28 data report unless the child has been adjudicated delinquent
 12 29 in the matter.  Nevertheless, the bill provides that official
 12 30 juvenile court records may be disclosed without a court order

 13 10    CONFIDENTIALITY OF TRANSCRIPTS.  The bill in newly
 13 11 designated Code section 232.147(3B) provides that if the court
 13 12 has excluded the public from a hearing pursuant to Code section
 13 13 232.39 or 232.92, the transcript of the proceedings shall not
 13 14 be deemed a public record and inspection and disclosure of
 13 15 the contents of the transcript shall not be permitted except
 13 16 pursuant to a court order or unless otherwise provided in Code
 13 17 chapter 232.
 13 18    USE OF ADJUDICATION OF DELINQUENCY FOR PENALTY ENHANCEMENTS
 13 19 OR EVIDENCE.  The bill in newly designated Code section
 13 20 232.147(13) provides that the confidentiality of a final
 13 21 adjudication of delinquency under Code section 232.147 or
 13 22 pursuant to Code section 232.149A shall not prohibit the state
 13 23 from pleading or proving the adjudication at a subsequent
 13 24 criminal or delinquency proceeding for the purpose of penalty
 13 25 enhancement when a provision of the Code specifically deems the
 13 26 delinquency adjudication to constitute a final conviction.
 13 27    The bill in newly designated Code section 232.147(14)
 13 28 provides that the provisions of the bill shall not be construed
 13 29 to limit or restrict the production, use, or introduction
 13 30 of official juvenile court records in any juvenile or adult
 13 31 criminal proceeding, where such records are relevant and deemed
 13 32 admissible under any other provision of the law.
 13 33    CONFIDENTIALITY OF RECORDS AND FILES OF CRIMINAL OR
 13 34 JUVENILE JUSTICE AGENCIES.  Under current law, records and
 13 35 files of a criminal or juvenile justice agency concerning
 14  1 a child involved in a delinquent act are public records,
 14  2 subject to certain exceptions. The bill in Code section
 14  3 232.149 provides that the records and files of a criminal or
 14  4 juvenile justice agency, an intake officer, or a juvenile court
 14  5 officer concerning a child involved in a delinquent act are
 14  6 confidential. The bill further provides that the records of an
 14  7 intake officer or juvenile court officer containing a dismissal
 14  8 of a complaint or an informal adjustment of a complaint when
 14  9 no petition is filed relating to the complaint, shall not be
 14 10 available to the public, but may be disclosed to the judge and
 14 11 professional court staff, including juvenile court officers;
 14 12 the child's counsel or guardian ad litem; the county attorney
 14 13 and county attorney's assistants;  the superintendent or the
 14 14 superintendent's designee of the school district for the
 14 15 school attended by the child or the authorities in charge of
 14 16 an accredited nonpublic school attended by the child; a member
 14 17 of the armed forces of the United States who is conducting a
 14 18 background investigation of an individual pursuant to federal
 14 19 law; the statistical analysis center for the purposes stated
 14 20 in Code section 216A.136; the state public defender;  the
 14 21 department of human services; and the alleged victim of the
 14 22 delinquent act.
 14 23    PUBLIC RECORDS HEARINGS.  The bill enacts new Code section
 14 24 232.149B, which provides that a person may apply for a court
 14 25 order to make confidential juvenile court records public.
 14 26 The bill provides that a rebuttable presumption exists that
 14 27 official juvenile court records shall remain confidential. The
 14 28 bill provides that the court shall order the official juvenile
 14 29 court records in such a delinquency proceeding to be public
 14 30 records if either the public's interest in making the records
 14 31 public outweighs the juvenile's interest in maintaining the
 14 32 confidentiality of the records or the juvenile has been placed
 14 33 on youthful offender status pursuant to Code section 232.45(7)
 14 34 and Code section 907.3A(1), and will be transferred back to
 14 35 the district court for sentencing prior to the child's 18th
 15  1 birthday. The court may order the official juvenile court
 15  2 records in such a delinquency proceeding to be public records
 15  3 if the juvenile has been subsequently adjudicated delinquent
 15  4 for a public offense that would be a serious misdemeanor,
 15  5 aggravated misdemeanor, or felony offense if committed by an
 15  6 adult, or another delinquency proceeding is pending seeking
 15  7 such an adjudication. The bill provides that records subject
 15  8 to a public records order may be sealed at a later date
 15  9 pursuant to Code section 232.150.
 15 10    RIGHT TO REVIEW AND RELEASE A CONFIDENTIAL COMPLAINT.  The
 15 11 bill provides that delinquency complaints shall be released
 15 12 in accordance with Code section 915.25. Under current Code
 15 13 section 915.25, a complaint which alleges that a child who is
 15 14 at least 10 years of age committed a delinquent act, which if
 15 15 committed by an adult would be a public offense, is a public
 15 16 record. Current Code section 915.25 authorizes the court,
 15 17 its designee, or law enforcement officials to release such
 15 18 a complaint, including the identity of the child. The bill
 15 19 amends Code section 915.25 to provide that such a complaint
 15 20 is confidential unless the complaint alleges that the child
 15 21 committed a delinquent act that if committed by an adult would
 15 22 be a forcible felony. However, the bill authorizes state and
 15 23 local enforcement officials to release a confidential complaint
 15 24 against a child if the child is at large and doing so is deemed
 15 25 necessary for the protection of the public or the safety of
 15 26 the child. If the complaint is not confidential because the
 15 27 alleged delinquent act is an act that would be a forcible
 15 28 felony if committed by an adult, the court, its designee,
 15 29 or law enforcement officials may release such a complaint,
 15 30 including the identity of the child.
 15 31    The bill provides that an intake or juvenile court officer
 15 32 shall disclose to the alleged victim of a delinquent act, upon
 15 33 request, the complaint, the name and address of the child who
 15 34 allegedly committed the delinquent act, and the disposition
 15 35 of the complaint. If the alleged delinquent act would be
 16  1 a forcible felony if committed by an adult, the intake or
 16  2 juvenile court officer shall provide notification to the victim
 16  3 as required by Code section 915.24.
 16  4    SEALING OF JUVENILE COURT RECORDS UNAVAILABLE FOR
 16  5 OPERATING=WHILE=INTOXICATED VIOLATIONS.  Under current Code
 16  6 section 232.150, a court shall order juvenile court records
 16  7 to be sealed if the person who is the subject of the juvenile
 16  8 court records is 18 years of age or older and 2 years have
 16  9 elapsed since the last official action in the person's case,
 16 10 the person has not been subsequently convicted of a felony
 16 11 or an aggravated or serious misdemeanor or adjudicated a
 16 12 delinquent child for an act which if committed by an adult
 16 13 would be a felony, an aggravated misdemeanor, or a serious
 16 14 misdemeanor and no proceeding is pending seeking such
 16 15 conviction or adjudication, and the person was not placed on
 16 16 youthful offender status, transferred back to district court
 16 17 after the youthful offender's 18th birthday, and sentenced for
 16 18 the offense which precipitated the youthful offender placement.
 16 19 The bill in newly designated Code section 232.150(4) provides
 16 20 that the court shall not seal a person's juvenile court records
 16 21 if the person was adjudicated delinquent for violating Code
 16 22 section 321J.2, which prohibits the operation of a motor
 16 23 vehicle while under the influence of alcohol or a drug.
 16 24    RELEASE OF CONFIDENTIAL RECORDS.  The bill provides that a
 16 25 public record which is confidential under the provisions of
 16 26 Code chapter 232 shall only be subject to release upon order of
 16 27 a court in a proceeding under Code chapter 232.
 16 28    EXISTING CONFIDENTIALITY EXEMPTIONS.  The bill retains
 16 29 certain existing exemptions to confidentiality of juvenile
 16 30 court records. Pursuant to Code section 692A.121(8), records
 16 31 concerning sex offense convictions which are committed by
 16 32 minors may be released in the same manner as records of
 16 33 convictions of adults. Pursuant to Code section 915.10A,
 16 34 information concerning a juvenile charged with a felony offense
 16 35 may be released pursuant to an automated victim notification
 17  1 system. Under the bill, these exemptions to confidentiality
 17  2 are not amended and therefore still apply to juvenile court
 17  3 records.
 17  4    RIGHT TO COUNSEL.  The bill in Code section 232.11 provides
 17  5 that a child has the right to be represented by counsel at a
 17  6 hearing on a confidentiality order under Code section 232.149A
 17  7 or a public records order under Code section 232.149B.

 12 26 shall not be available to the public or any governmental
 12 27 agency through the internet or in an electronic customized

 12 29 in the matter.  Nevertheless, the bill provides that official
 12 30 juvenile court records may be disclosed without a court order

 13 18    USE OF ADJUDICATION OF DELINQUENCY FOR PENALTY ENHANCEMENTS
 13 19 OR EVIDENCE.  The bill in newly designated Code section

 13 21 adjudication of delinquency under Code section 232.147 or
 13 22 pursuant to Code section 232.149A shall not prohibit the state
 13 23 from pleading or proving the adjudication at a subsequent

 13 25 enhancement when a provision of the Code specifically deems the
 13 26 delinquency adjudication to constitute a final conviction.
 13 27    The bill in newly designated Code section 232.147(14)

 13 33    CONFIDENTIALITY OF RECORDS AND FILES OF CRIMINAL OR

 13 35 files of a criminal or juvenile justice agency concerning
 14  1 a child involved in a delinquent act are public records,
 14  2 subject to certain exceptions. The bill in Code section
 14  3 232.149 provides that the records and files of a criminal or
 14  4 juvenile justice agency, an intake officer, or a juvenile court
 14  5 officer concerning a child involved in a delinquent act are

 14  8 of a complaint or an informal adjustment of a complaint when
 14  9 no petition is filed relating to the complaint, shall not be

 15 10    RIGHT TO REVIEW AND RELEASE A CONFIDENTIAL COMPLAINT.  The
 15 11 bill provides that delinquency complaints shall be released
 15 12 in accordance with Code section 915.25. Under current Code
 15 13 section 915.25, a complaint which alleges that a child who is
 15 14 at least 10 years of age committed a delinquent act, which if
 15 15 committed by an adult would be a public offense, is a public
 15 16 record. Current Code section 915.25 authorizes the court,
 15 17 its designee, or law enforcement officials to release such
 15 18 a complaint, including the identity of the child. The bill
 15 19 amends Code section 915.25 to provide that such a complaint
 15 20 is confidential unless the complaint alleges that the child
 15 21 committed a delinquent act that if committed by an adult would
 15 22 be a forcible felony. However, the bill authorizes state and

 15 31    The bill provides that an intake or juvenile court officer
 15 32 shall disclose to the alleged victim of a delinquent act, upon
 15 33 request, the complaint, the name and address of the child who
 15 34 allegedly committed the delinquent act, and the disposition
 15 35 of the complaint. If the alleged delinquent act would be
 16  1 a forcible felony if committed by an adult, the intake or

 16  3 as required by Code section 915.24.
 16  4    SEALING OF JUVENILE COURT RECORDS UNAVAILABLE FOR

 16  7 to be sealed if the person who is the subject of the juvenile
 16  8 court records is 18 years of age or older and 2 years have
 16  9 elapsed since the last official action in the person's case,
 16 10 the person has not been subsequently convicted of a felony

 12  4 preparation of a presentence report concerning a person
 12  5 who prior thereto had been the subject of a juvenile court
 12  6 delinquency proceeding; the child's foster parent or an
 12  7 individual providing preadoptive care to the child; the state
 12  8 public defender; the department of corrections; a judicial
 12  9 district department of correctional services; the board of
 12 10 parole; the superintendent or the superintendent's designee of
 12 11 the school district for the school attended by the child or
 12 12 the authorities in charge of an accredited nonpublic school
 12 13 attended by the child; a member of the armed forces of the
 12 14 United States who is conducting a background investigation of
 12 15 an individual pursuant to federal law; the statistical analysis
 12 16 center for the purposes stated in Code section 216A.136; a
 12 17 state or local law enforcement agency; and the alleged victim
 12 18 of any delinquent act in the proceeding.
 12 19    The bill in newly designated Code section 232.147(3A)
 12 20 provides that juvenile court records containing a petition or
 12 21 complaint alleging the commission of a delinquent act that
 12 22 would be a forcible felony if committed by an adult shall be
 12 23 public records unless subject to a confidentiality order under
 12 24 Code section 232.149A or a sealing order under Code section
 12 25 232.150.  However, the bill provides that such official records
 12 26 shall not be available to the public or any governmental
 12 27 agency through the internet or in an electronic customized
 12 28 data report unless the child has been adjudicated delinquent
 12 29 in the matter.  Nevertheless, the bill provides that official
 12 30 juvenile court records may be disclosed without a court order
 12 31 through the internet or in an electronic customized data
 12 32 report prior to the child being adjudicated delinquent to the
 12 33 judge and professional court staff, including juvenile court
 12 34 officers; the child's counsel or guardian ad litem; the county
 12 35 attorney and the county attorney's assistants; a court, court
 13  1 professional staff, and adult probation officers in connection
 13  2 with the preparation of a presentence report concerning a

 13  4 court proceeding; a state or local law enforcement agency; the
 13  5 state public defender; the statistical analysis center for
 13  6 the purposes stated in Code section 216A.136; the department
 13  7 of human services; the department of corrections; a judicial
 13  8 district department of correctional services; and the board of
 13  9 parole.
 13 10    CONFIDENTIALITY OF TRANSCRIPTS.  The bill in newly
 13 11 designated Code section 232.147(3B) provides that if the court
 13 12 has excluded the public from a hearing pursuant to Code section
 13 13 232.39 or 232.92, the transcript of the proceedings shall not
 13 14 be deemed a public record and inspection and disclosure of
 13 15 the contents of the transcript shall not be permitted except
 13 16 pursuant to a court order or unless otherwise provided in Code
 13 17 chapter 232.
 13 18    USE OF ADJUDICATION OF DELINQUENCY FOR PENALTY ENHANCEMENTS
 13 19 OR EVIDENCE.  The bill in newly designated Code section
 13 20 232.147(13) provides that the confidentiality of a final
 13 21 adjudication of delinquency under Code section 232.147 or
 13 22 pursuant to Code section 232.149A shall not prohibit the state
 13 23 from pleading or proving the adjudication at a subsequent
 13 24 criminal or delinquency proceeding for the purpose of penalty
 13 25 enhancement when a provision of the Code specifically deems the
 13 26 delinquency adjudication to constitute a final conviction.
 13 27    The bill in newly designated Code section 232.147(14)
 13 28 provides that the provisions of the bill shall not be construed
 13 29 to limit or restrict the production, use, or introduction
 13 30 of official juvenile court records in any juvenile or adult
 13 31 criminal proceeding, where such records are relevant and deemed
 13 32 admissible under any other provision of the law.
 13 33    CONFIDENTIALITY OF RECORDS AND FILES OF CRIMINAL OR
 13 34 JUVENILE JUSTICE AGENCIES.  Under current law, records and
 13 35 files of a criminal or juvenile justice agency concerning
 14  1 a child involved in a delinquent act are public records,
 14  2 subject to certain exceptions. The bill in Code section
 14  3 232.149 provides that the records and files of a criminal or
 14  4 juvenile justice agency, an intake officer, or a juvenile court
 14  5 officer concerning a child involved in a delinquent act are
 14  6 confidential. The bill further provides that the records of an
 14  7 intake officer or juvenile court officer containing a dismissal
 14  8 of a complaint or an informal adjustment of a complaint when
 14  9 no petition is filed relating to the complaint, shall not be
 14 10 available to the public, but may be disclosed to the judge and
 14 11 professional court staff, including juvenile court officers;
 14 12 the child's counsel or guardian ad litem; the county attorney
 14 13 and county attorney's assistants;  the superintendent or the
 14 14 superintendent's designee of the school district for the
 14 15 school attended by the child or the authorities in charge of
 14 16 an accredited nonpublic school attended by the child; a member
 14 17 of the armed forces of the United States who is conducting a
 14 18 background investigation of an individual pursuant to federal
 14 19 law; the statistical analysis center for the purposes stated
 14 20 in Code section 216A.136; the state public defender;  the
 14 21 department of human services; and the alleged victim of the
 14 22 delinquent act.
 14 23    PUBLIC RECORDS HEARINGS.  The bill enacts new Code section
 14 24 232.149B, which provides that a person may apply for a court
 14 25 order to make confidential juvenile court records public.
 14 26 The bill provides that a rebuttable presumption exists that
 14 27 official juvenile court records shall remain confidential. The
 14 28 bill provides that the court shall order the official juvenile
 14 29 court records in such a delinquency proceeding to be public
 14 30 records if either the public's interest in making the records
 14 31 public outweighs the juvenile's interest in maintaining the
 14 32 confidentiality of the records or the juvenile has been placed
 14 33 on youthful offender status pursuant to Code section 232.45(7)
 14 34 and Code section 907.3A(1), and will be transferred back to
 14 35 the district court for sentencing prior to the child's 18th
 15  1 birthday. The court may order the official juvenile court
 15  2 records in such a delinquency proceeding to be public records
 15  3 if the juvenile has been subsequently adjudicated delinquent
 15  4 for a public offense that would be a serious misdemeanor,
 15  5 aggravated misdemeanor, or felony offense if committed by an
 15  6 adult, or another delinquency proceeding is pending seeking
 15  7 such an adjudication. The bill provides that records subject
 15  8 to a public records order may be sealed at a later date
 15  9 pursuant to Code section 232.150.
 15 10    RIGHT TO REVIEW AND RELEASE A CONFIDENTIAL COMPLAINT.  The
 15 11 bill provides that delinquency complaints shall be released
 15 12 in accordance with Code section 915.25. Under current Code
 15 13 section 915.25, a complaint which alleges that a child who is
 15 14 at least 10 years of age committed a delinquent act, which if
 15 15 committed by an adult would be a public offense, is a public
 15 16 record. Current Code section 915.25 authorizes the court,
 15 17 its designee, or law enforcement officials to release such
 15 18 a complaint, including the identity of the child. The bill
 15 19 amends Code section 915.25 to provide that such a complaint
 15 20 is confidential unless the complaint alleges that the child
 15 21 committed a delinquent act that if committed by an adult would
 15 22 be a forcible felony. However, the bill authorizes state and
 15 23 local enforcement officials to release a confidential complaint
 15 24 against a child if the child is at large and doing so is deemed
 15 25 necessary for the protection of the public or the safety of
 15 26 the child. If the complaint is not confidential because the
 15 27 alleged delinquent act is an act that would be a forcible
 15 28 felony if committed by an adult, the court, its designee,
 15 29 or law enforcement officials may release such a complaint,
 15 30 including the identity of the child.
 15 31    The bill provides that an intake or juvenile court officer
 15 32 shall disclose to the alleged victim of a delinquent act, upon
 15 33 request, the complaint, the name and address of the child who
 15 34 allegedly committed the delinquent act, and the disposition
 15 35 of the complaint. If the alleged delinquent act would be
 16  1 a forcible felony if committed by an adult, the intake or
 16  2 juvenile court officer shall provide notification to the victim
 16  3 as required by Code section 915.24.
 16  4    SEALING OF JUVENILE COURT RECORDS UNAVAILABLE FOR
 16  5 OPERATING=WHILE=INTOXICATED VIOLATIONS.  Under current Code
 16  6 section 232.150, a court shall order juvenile court records
 16  7 to be sealed if the person who is the subject of the juvenile
 16  8 court records is 18 years of age or older and 2 years have
 16  9 elapsed since the last official action in the person's case,
 16 10 the person has not been subsequently convicted of a felony
 16 11 or an aggravated or serious misdemeanor or adjudicated a
 16 12 delinquent child for an act which if committed by an adult
 16 13 would be a felony, an aggravated misdemeanor, or a serious
 16 14 misdemeanor and no proceeding is pending seeking such
 16 15 conviction or adjudication, and the person was not placed on
 16 16 youthful offender status, transferred back to district court
 16 17 after the youthful offender's 18th birthday, and sentenced for
 16 18 the offense which precipitated the youthful offender placement.
 16 19 The bill in newly designated Code section 232.150(4) provides
 16 20 that the court shall not seal a person's juvenile court records
 16 21 if the person was adjudicated delinquent for violating Code
 16 22 section 321J.2, which prohibits the operation of a motor
 16 23 vehicle while under the influence of alcohol or a drug.
 16 24    RELEASE OF CONFIDENTIAL RECORDS.  The bill provides that a
 16 25 public record which is confidential under the provisions of
 16 26 Code chapter 232 shall only be subject to release upon order of
 16 27 a court in a proceeding under Code chapter 232.
 16 28    EXISTING CONFIDENTIALITY EXEMPTIONS.  The bill retains
 16 29 certain existing exemptions to confidentiality of juvenile
 16 30 court records. Pursuant to Code section 692A.121(8), records
 16 31 concerning sex offense convictions which are committed by
 16 32 minors may be released in the same manner as records of
 16 33 convictions of adults. Pursuant to Code section 915.10A,
 16 34 information concerning a juvenile charged with a felony offense
 16 35 may be released pursuant to an automated victim notification
 17  1 system. Under the bill, these exemptions to confidentiality
 17  2 are not amended and therefore still apply to juvenile court
 17  3 records.
 17  4    RIGHT TO COUNSEL.  The bill in Code section 232.11 provides
 17  5 that a child has the right to be represented by counsel at a
 17  6 hearing on a confidentiality order under Code section 232.149A
 17  7 or a public records order under Code section 232.149B.
 17  8    APPLICABILITY.  The bill applies to juvenile delinquency
 17  9 proceedings which are pending or arise on or after July 1,
 17 10 2016.

 12 19    The bill in newly designated Code section 232.147(3A)

 12 22 would be a forcible felony if committed by an adult shall be
 12 23 public records unless subject to a confidentiality order under
 12 24 Code section 232.149A or a sealing order under Code section
 12 25 232.150.  However, the bill provides that such official records
 12 26 shall not be available to the public or any governmental
 12 27 agency through the internet or in an electronic customized
 12 28 data report unless the child has been adjudicated delinquent
 12 29 in the matter.  Nevertheless, the bill provides that official
 12 30 juvenile court records may be disclosed without a court order
 12 31 through the internet or in an electronic customized data
 12 32 report prior to the child being adjudicated delinquent to the
 12 33 judge and professional court staff, including juvenile court
 12 34 officers; the child's counsel or guardian ad litem; the county
 12 35 attorney and the county attorney's assistants; a court, court
 13  1 professional staff, and adult probation officers in connection
 13  2 with the preparation of a presentence report concerning a
 13  3 person who prior thereto had been the subject of a juvenile
 13  4 court proceeding; a state or local law enforcement agency; the
 13  5 state public defender; the statistical analysis center for
 13  6 the purposes stated in Code section 216A.136; the department
 13  7 of human services; the department of corrections; a judicial
 13  8 district department of correctional services; and the board of
 13  9 parole.
 13 10    CONFIDENTIALITY OF TRANSCRIPTS.  The bill in newly
 13 11 designated Code section 232.147(3B) provides that if the court
 13 12 has excluded the public from a hearing pursuant to Code section
 13 13 232.39 or 232.92, the transcript of the proceedings shall not
 13 14 be deemed a public record and inspection and disclosure of
 13 15 the contents of the transcript shall not be permitted except
 13 16 pursuant to a court order or unless otherwise provided in Code
 13 17 chapter 232.
 13 18    USE OF ADJUDICATION OF DELINQUENCY FOR PENALTY ENHANCEMENTS
 13 19 OR EVIDENCE.  The bill in newly designated Code section
 13 20 232.147(13) provides that the confidentiality of a final
 13 21 adjudication of delinquency under Code section 232.147 or
 13 22 pursuant to Code section 232.149A shall not prohibit the state
 13 23 from pleading or proving the adjudication at a subsequent
 13 24 criminal or delinquency proceeding for the purpose of penalty
 13 25 enhancement when a provision of the Code specifically deems the
 13 26 delinquency adjudication to constitute a final conviction.
 13 27    The bill in newly designated Code section 232.147(14)
 13 28 provides that the provisions of the bill shall not be construed
 13 29 to limit or restrict the production, use, or introduction
 13 30 of official juvenile court records in any juvenile or adult
 13 31 criminal proceeding, where such records are relevant and deemed
 13 32 admissible under any other provision of the law.
 13 33    CONFIDENTIALITY OF RECORDS AND FILES OF CRIMINAL OR
 13 34 JUVENILE JUSTICE AGENCIES.  Under current law, records and
 13 35 files of a criminal or juvenile justice agency concerning
 14  1 a child involved in a delinquent act are public records,
 14  2 subject to certain exceptions. The bill in Code section
 14  3 232.149 provides that the records and files of a criminal or
 14  4 juvenile justice agency, an intake officer, or a juvenile court
 14  5 officer concerning a child involved in a delinquent act are
 14  6 confidential. The bill further provides that the records of an
 14  7 intake officer or juvenile court officer containing a dismissal
 14  8 of a complaint or an informal adjustment of a complaint when
 14  9 no petition is filed relating to the complaint, shall not be
 14 10 available to the public, but may be disclosed to the judge and
 14 11 professional court staff, including juvenile court officers;
 14 12 the child's counsel or guardian ad litem; the county attorney
 14 13 and county attorney's assistants;  the superintendent or the
 14 14 superintendent's designee of the school district for the
 14 15 school attended by the child or the authorities in charge of
 14 16 an accredited nonpublic school attended by the child; a member
 14 17 of the armed forces of the United States who is conducting a

 14 19 law; the statistical analysis center for the purposes stated
 14 20 in Code section 216A.136; the state public defender;  the
 14 21 department of human services; and the alleged victim of the
 14 22 delinquent act.
 14 23    PUBLIC RECORDS HEARINGS.  The bill enacts new Code section
 14 24 232.149B, which provides that a person may apply for a court
 14 25 order to make confidential juvenile court records public.
 14 26 The bill provides that a rebuttable presumption exists that
 14 27 official juvenile court records shall remain confidential. The
 14 28 bill provides that the court shall order the official juvenile
 14 29 court records in such a delinquency proceeding to be public
 14 30 records if either the public's interest in making the records
 14 31 public outweighs the juvenile's interest in maintaining the
 14 32 confidentiality of the records or the juvenile has been placed
 14 33 on youthful offender status pursuant to Code section 232.45(7)
 14 34 and Code section 907.3A(1), and will be transferred back to
 14 35 the district court for sentencing prior to the child's 18th
 15  1 birthday. The court may order the official juvenile court
 15  2 records in such a delinquency proceeding to be public records
 15  3 if the juvenile has been subsequently adjudicated delinquent
 15  4 for a public offense that would be a serious misdemeanor,
 15  5 aggravated misdemeanor, or felony offense if committed by an
 15  6 adult, or another delinquency proceeding is pending seeking
 15  7 such an adjudication. The bill provides that records subject
 15  8 to a public records order may be sealed at a later date
 15  9 pursuant to Code section 232.150.
 15 10    RIGHT TO REVIEW AND RELEASE A CONFIDENTIAL COMPLAINT.  The
 15 11 bill provides that delinquency complaints shall be released
 15 12 in accordance with Code section 915.25. Under current Code
 15 13 section 915.25, a complaint which alleges that a child who is
 15 14 at least 10 years of age committed a delinquent act, which if
 15 15 committed by an adult would be a public offense, is a public
 15 16 record. Current Code section 915.25 authorizes the court,
 15 17 its designee, or law enforcement officials to release such
 15 18 a complaint, including the identity of the child. The bill
 15 19 amends Code section 915.25 to provide that such a complaint
 15 20 is confidential unless the complaint alleges that the child
 15 21 committed a delinquent act that if committed by an adult would
 15 22 be a forcible felony. However, the bill authorizes state and
 15 23 local enforcement officials to release a confidential complaint
 15 24 against a child if the child is at large and doing so is deemed
 15 25 necessary for the protection of the public or the safety of
 15 26 the child. If the complaint is not confidential because the
 15 27 alleged delinquent act is an act that would be a forcible
 15 28 felony if committed by an adult, the court, its designee,
 15 29 or law enforcement officials may release such a complaint,
 15 30 including the identity of the child.
 15 31    The bill provides that an intake or juvenile court officer
 15 32 shall disclose to the alleged victim of a delinquent act, upon
 15 33 request, the complaint, the name and address of the child who
 15 34 allegedly committed the delinquent act, and the disposition
 15 35 of the complaint. If the alleged delinquent act would be
 16  1 a forcible felony if committed by an adult, the intake or
 16  2 juvenile court officer shall provide notification to the victim
 16  3 as required by Code section 915.24.
 16  4    SEALING OF JUVENILE COURT RECORDS UNAVAILABLE FOR
 16  5 OPERATING=WHILE=INTOXICATED VIOLATIONS.  Under current Code
 16  6 section 232.150, a court shall order juvenile court records
 16  7 to be sealed if the person who is the subject of the juvenile
 16  8 court records is 18 years of age or older and 2 years have
 16  9 elapsed since the last official action in the person's case,
 16 10 the person has not been subsequently convicted of a felony
 16 11 or an aggravated or serious misdemeanor or adjudicated a
 16 12 delinquent child for an act which if committed by an adult
 16 13 would be a felony, an aggravated misdemeanor, or a serious
 16 14 misdemeanor and no proceeding is pending seeking such
 16 15 conviction or adjudication, and the person was not placed on
 16 16 youthful offender status, transferred back to district court
 16 17 after the youthful offender's 18th birthday, and sentenced for
 16 18 the offense which precipitated the youthful offender placement.
 16 19 The bill in newly designated Code section 232.150(4) provides
 16 20 that the court shall not seal a person's juvenile court records
 16 21 if the person was adjudicated delinquent for violating Code
 16 22 section 321J.2, which prohibits the operation of a motor
 16 23 vehicle while under the influence of alcohol or a drug.
 16 24    RELEASE OF CONFIDENTIAL RECORDS.  The bill provides that a
 16 25 public record which is confidential under the provisions of
 16 26 Code chapter 232 shall only be subject to release upon order of
 16 27 a court in a proceeding under Code chapter 232.
 16 28    EXISTING CONFIDENTIALITY EXEMPTIONS.  The bill retains
 16 29 certain existing exemptions to confidentiality of juvenile
 16 30 court records. Pursuant to Code section 692A.121(8), records
 16 31 concerning sex offense convictions which are committed by

 13  4 court proceeding; a state or local law enforcement agency; the
 13  5 state public defender; the statistical analysis center for
 13  6 the purposes stated in Code section 216A.136; the department
 13  7 of human services; the department of corrections; a judicial
 13  8 district department of correctional services; and the board of
 13  9 parole.
 13 10    CONFIDENTIALITY OF TRANSCRIPTS.  The bill in newly
 13 11 designated Code section 232.147(3B) provides that if the court
 13 12 has excluded the public from a hearing pursuant to Code section
 13 13 232.39 or 232.92, the transcript of the proceedings shall not
 13 14 be deemed a public record and inspection and disclosure of
 13 15 the contents of the transcript shall not be permitted except
 13 16 pursuant to a court order or unless otherwise provided in Code
 13 17 chapter 232.
 13 18    USE OF ADJUDICATION OF DELINQUENCY FOR PENALTY ENHANCEMENTS
 13 19 OR EVIDENCE.  The bill in newly designated Code section
 13 20 232.147(13) provides that the confidentiality of a final
 13 21 adjudication of delinquency under Code section 232.147 or
 13 22 pursuant to Code section 232.149A shall not prohibit the state
 13 23 from pleading or proving the adjudication at a subsequent
 13 24 criminal or delinquency proceeding for the purpose of penalty
 13 25 enhancement when a provision of the Code specifically deems the
 13 26 delinquency adjudication to constitute a final conviction.
 13 27    The bill in newly designated Code section 232.147(14)
 13 28 provides that the provisions of the bill shall not be construed
 13 29 to limit or restrict the production, use, or introduction
 13 30 of official juvenile court records in any juvenile or adult
 13 31 criminal proceeding, where such records are relevant and deemed
 13 32 admissible under any other provision of the law.
 13 33    CONFIDENTIALITY OF RECORDS AND FILES OF CRIMINAL OR
 13 34 JUVENILE JUSTICE AGENCIES.  Under current law, records and
 13 35 files of a criminal or juvenile justice agency concerning
 14  1 a child involved in a delinquent act are public records,
 14  2 subject to certain exceptions. The bill in Code section
 14  3 232.149 provides that the records and files of a criminal or
 14  4 juvenile justice agency, an intake officer, or a juvenile court
 14  5 officer concerning a child involved in a delinquent act are
 14  6 confidential. The bill further provides that the records of an
 14  7 intake officer or juvenile court officer containing a dismissal
 14  8 of a complaint or an informal adjustment of a complaint when
 14  9 no petition is filed relating to the complaint, shall not be
 14 10 available to the public, but may be disclosed to the judge and
 14 11 professional court staff, including juvenile court officers;
 14 12 the child's counsel or guardian ad litem; the county attorney
 14 13 and county attorney's assistants;  the superintendent or the
 14 14 superintendent's designee of the school district for the
 14 15 school attended by the child or the authorities in charge of
 14 16 an accredited nonpublic school attended by the child; a member
 14 17 of the armed forces of the United States who is conducting a
 14 18 background investigation of an individual pursuant to federal
 14 19 law; the statistical analysis center for the purposes stated
 14 20 in Code section 216A.136; the state public defender;  the
 14 21 department of human services; and the alleged victim of the
 14 22 delinquent act.
 14 23    PUBLIC RECORDS HEARINGS.  The bill enacts new Code section
 14 24 232.149B, which provides that a person may apply for a court
 14 25 order to make confidential juvenile court records public.
 14 26 The bill provides that a rebuttable presumption exists that
 14 27 official juvenile court records shall remain confidential. The
 14 28 bill provides that the court shall order the official juvenile
 14 29 court records in such a delinquency proceeding to be public
 14 30 records if either the public's interest in making the records
 14 31 public outweighs the juvenile's interest in maintaining the
 14 32 confidentiality of the records or the juvenile has been placed
 14 33 on youthful offender status pursuant to Code section 232.45(7)
 14 34 and Code section 907.3A(1), and will be transferred back to
 14 35 the district court for sentencing prior to the child's 18th
 15  1 birthday. The court may order the official juvenile court
 15  2 records in such a delinquency proceeding to be public records
 15  3 if the juvenile has been subsequently adjudicated delinquent
 15  4 for a public offense that would be a serious misdemeanor,
 15  5 aggravated misdemeanor, or felony offense if committed by an
 15  6 adult, or another delinquency proceeding is pending seeking
 15  7 such an adjudication. The bill provides that records subject
 15  8 to a public records order may be sealed at a later date
 15  9 pursuant to Code section 232.150.
 15 10    RIGHT TO REVIEW AND RELEASE A CONFIDENTIAL COMPLAINT.  The
 15 11 bill provides that delinquency complaints shall be released
 15 12 in accordance with Code section 915.25. Under current Code
 15 13 section 915.25, a complaint which alleges that a child who is
 15 14 at least 10 years of age committed a delinquent act, which if
 15 15 committed by an adult would be a public offense, is a public
 15 16 record. Current Code section 915.25 authorizes the court,
 15 17 its designee, or law enforcement officials to release such
 15 18 a complaint, including the identity of the child. The bill
 15 19 amends Code section 915.25 to provide that such a complaint
 15 20 is confidential unless the complaint alleges that the child
 15 21 committed a delinquent act that if committed by an adult would
 15 22 be a forcible felony. However, the bill authorizes state and
 15 23 local enforcement officials to release a confidential complaint
 15 24 against a child if the child is at large and doing so is deemed
 15 25 necessary for the protection of the public or the safety of
 15 26 the child. If the complaint is not confidential because the
 15 27 alleged delinquent act is an act that would be a forcible
 15 28 felony if committed by an adult, the court, its designee,
 15 29 or law enforcement officials may release such a complaint,
 15 30 including the identity of the child.
 15 31    The bill provides that an intake or juvenile court officer
 15 32 shall disclose to the alleged victim of a delinquent act, upon
 15 33 request, the complaint, the name and address of the child who
 15 34 allegedly committed the delinquent act, and the disposition
 15 35 of the complaint. If the alleged delinquent act would be
 16  1 a forcible felony if committed by an adult, the intake or
 16  2 juvenile court officer shall provide notification to the victim
 16  3 as required by Code section 915.24.
 16  4    SEALING OF JUVENILE COURT RECORDS UNAVAILABLE FOR
 16  5 OPERATING=WHILE=INTOXICATED VIOLATIONS.  Under current Code
 16  6 section 232.150, a court shall order juvenile court records
 16  7 to be sealed if the person who is the subject of the juvenile
 16  8 court records is 18 years of age or older and 2 years have
 16  9 elapsed since the last official action in the person's case,
 16 10 the person has not been subsequently convicted of a felony
 16 11 or an aggravated or serious misdemeanor or adjudicated a
 16 12 delinquent child for an act which if committed by an adult
 16 13 would be a felony, an aggravated misdemeanor, or a serious
 16 14 misdemeanor and no proceeding is pending seeking such
 16 15 conviction or adjudication, and the person was not placed on
 16 16 youthful offender status, transferred back to district court
 16 17 after the youthful offender's 18th birthday, and sentenced for
 16 18 the offense which precipitated the youthful offender placement.
 16 19 The bill in newly designated Code section 232.150(4) provides
 16 20 that the court shall not seal a person's juvenile court records
 16 21 if the person was adjudicated delinquent for violating Code
 16 22 section 321J.2, which prohibits the operation of a motor
 16 23 vehicle while under the influence of alcohol or a drug.
 16 24    RELEASE OF CONFIDENTIAL RECORDS.  The bill provides that a
 16 25 public record which is confidential under the provisions of
 16 26 Code chapter 232 shall only be subject to release upon order of
 16 27 a court in a proceeding under Code chapter 232.
 16 28    EXISTING CONFIDENTIALITY EXEMPTIONS.  The bill retains
 16 29 certain existing exemptions to confidentiality of juvenile
 16 30 court records. Pursuant to Code section 692A.121(8), records
 16 31 concerning sex offense convictions which are committed by
 16 32 minors may be released in the same manner as records of
 16 33 convictions of adults. Pursuant to Code section 915.10A,
 16 34 information concerning a juvenile charged with a felony offense
 16 35 may be released pursuant to an automated victim notification
 17  1 system. Under the bill, these exemptions to confidentiality
 17  2 are not amended and therefore still apply to juvenile court
 17  3 records.
 17  4    RIGHT TO COUNSEL.  The bill in Code section 232.11 provides
 17  5 that a child has the right to be represented by counsel at a
 17  6 hearing on a confidentiality order under Code section 232.149A
 17  7 or a public records order under Code section 232.149B.
 17  8    APPLICABILITY.  The bill applies to juvenile delinquency
 17  9 proceedings which are pending or arise on or after July 1,
 17 10 2016.

 12 18 of any delinquent act in the proceeding.
 12 19    The bill in newly designated Code section 232.147(3A)
 12 20 provides that juvenile court records containing a petition or
 12 21 complaint alleging the commission of a delinquent act that
 12 22 would be a forcible felony if committed by an adult shall be
 12 23 public records unless subject to a confidentiality order under
 12 24 Code section 232.149A or a sealing order under Code section
 12 25 232.150.  However, the bill provides that such official records
 12 26 shall not be available to the public or any governmental
 12 27 agency through the internet or in an electronic customized
 12 28 data report unless the child has been adjudicated delinquent
 12 29 in the matter.  Nevertheless, the bill provides that official
 12 30 juvenile court records may be disclosed without a court order
 12 31 through the internet or in an electronic customized data
 12 32 report prior to the child being adjudicated delinquent to the
 12 33 judge and professional court staff, including juvenile court
 12 34 officers; the child's counsel or guardian ad litem; the county
 12 35 attorney and the county attorney's assistants; a court, court
 13  1 professional staff, and adult probation officers in connection
 13  2 with the preparation of a presentence report concerning a
 13  3 person who prior thereto had been the subject of a juvenile
 13  4 court proceeding; a state or local law enforcement agency; the
 13  5 state public defender; the statistical analysis center for
 13  6 the purposes stated in Code section 216A.136; the department
 13  7 of human services; the department of corrections; a judicial
 13  8 district department of correctional services; and the board of
 13  9 parole.
 13 10    CONFIDENTIALITY OF TRANSCRIPTS.  The bill in newly
 13 11 designated Code section 232.147(3B) provides that if the court
 13 12 has excluded the public from a hearing pursuant to Code section
 13 13 232.39 or 232.92, the transcript of the proceedings shall not
 13 14 be deemed a public record and inspection and disclosure of
 13 15 the contents of the transcript shall not be permitted except
 13 16 pursuant to a court order or unless otherwise provided in Code
 13 17 chapter 232.
 13 18    USE OF ADJUDICATION OF DELINQUENCY FOR PENALTY ENHANCEMENTS
 13 19 OR EVIDENCE.  The bill in newly designated Code section
 13 20 232.147(13) provides that the confidentiality of a final
 13 21 adjudication of delinquency under Code section 232.147 or
 13 22 pursuant to Code section 232.149A shall not prohibit the state
 13 23 from pleading or proving the adjudication at a subsequent
 13 24 criminal or delinquency proceeding for the purpose of penalty
 13 25 enhancement when a provision of the Code specifically deems the
 13 26 delinquency adjudication to constitute a final conviction.
 13 27    The bill in newly designated Code section 232.147(14)
 13 28 provides that the provisions of the bill shall not be construed
 13 29 to limit or restrict the production, use, or introduction
 13 30 of official juvenile court records in any juvenile or adult
 13 31 criminal proceeding, where such records are relevant and deemed
 13 32 admissible under any other provision of the law.
 13 33    CONFIDENTIALITY OF RECORDS AND FILES OF CRIMINAL OR
 13 34 JUVENILE JUSTICE AGENCIES.  Under current law, records and
 13 35 files of a criminal or juvenile justice agency concerning
 14  1 a child involved in a delinquent act are public records,
 14  2 subject to certain exceptions. The bill in Code section
 14  3 232.149 provides that the records and files of a criminal or
 14  4 juvenile justice agency, an intake officer, or a juvenile court
 14  5 officer concerning a child involved in a delinquent act are
 14  6 confidential. The bill further provides that the records of an
 14  7 intake officer or juvenile court officer containing a dismissal
 14  8 of a complaint or an informal adjustment of a complaint when
 14  9 no petition is filed relating to the complaint, shall not be
 14 10 available to the public, but may be disclosed to the judge and
 14 11 professional court staff, including juvenile court officers;
 14 12 the child's counsel or guardian ad litem; the county attorney
 14 13 and county attorney's assistants;  the superintendent or the
 14 14 superintendent's designee of the school district for the
 14 15 school attended by the child or the authorities in charge of
 14 16 an accredited nonpublic school attended by the child; a member
 14 17 of the armed forces of the United States who is conducting a
 14 18 background investigation of an individual pursuant to federal
 14 19 law; the statistical analysis center for the purposes stated
 14 20 in Code section 216A.136; the state public defender;  the
 14 21 department of human services; and the alleged victim of the
 14 22 delinquent act.
 14 23    PUBLIC RECORDS HEARINGS.  The bill enacts new Code section
 14 24 232.149B, which provides that a person may apply for a court
 14 25 order to make confidential juvenile court records public.
 14 26 The bill provides that a rebuttable presumption exists that
 14 27 official juvenile court records shall remain confidential. The
 14 28 bill provides that the court shall order the official juvenile
 14 29 court records in such a delinquency proceeding to be public
 14 30 records if either the public's interest in making the records
 14 31 public outweighs the juvenile's interest in maintaining the
 14 32 confidentiality of the records or the juvenile has been placed
 14 33 on youthful offender status pursuant to Code section 232.45(7)
 14 34 and Code section 907.3A(1), and will be transferred back to
 14 35 the district court for sentencing prior to the child's 18th
 15  1 birthday. The court may order the official juvenile court
 15  2 records in such a delinquency proceeding to be public records
 15  3 if the juvenile has been subsequently adjudicated delinquent
 15  4 for a public offense that would be a serious misdemeanor,
 15  5 aggravated misdemeanor, or felony offense if committed by an
 15  6 adult, or another delinquency proceeding is pending seeking
 15  7 such an adjudication. The bill provides that records subject
 15  8 to a public records order may be sealed at a later date
 15  9 pursuant to Code section 232.150.
 15 10    RIGHT TO REVIEW AND RELEASE A CONFIDENTIAL COMPLAINT.  The
 15 11 bill provides that delinquency complaints shall be released
 15 12 in accordance with Code section 915.25. Under current Code
 15 13 section 915.25, a complaint which alleges that a child who is
 15 14 at least 10 years of age committed a delinquent act, which if
 15 15 committed by an adult would be a public offense, is a public
 15 16 record. Current Code section 915.25 authorizes the court,
 15 17 its designee, or law enforcement officials to release such
 15 18 a complaint, including the identity of the child. The bill
 15 19 amends Code section 915.25 to provide that such a complaint
 15 20 is confidential unless the complaint alleges that the child
 15 21 committed a delinquent act that if committed by an adult would
 15 22 be a forcible felony. However, the bill authorizes state and
 15 23 local enforcement officials to release a confidential complaint
 15 24 against a child if the child is at large and doing so is deemed
 15 25 necessary for the protection of the public or the safety of
 15 26 the child. If the complaint is not confidential because the
 15 27 alleged delinquent act is an act that would be a forcible
 15 28 felony if committed by an adult, the court, its designee,
 15 29 or law enforcement officials may release such a complaint,
 15 30 including the identity of the child.
 15 31    The bill provides that an intake or juvenile court officer
 15 32 shall disclose to the alleged victim of a delinquent act, upon
 15 33 request, the complaint, the name and address of the child who
 15 34 allegedly committed the delinquent act, and the disposition
 15 35 of the complaint. If the alleged delinquent act would be
 16  1 a forcible felony if committed by an adult, the intake or
 16  2 juvenile court officer shall provide notification to the victim
 16  3 as required by Code section 915.24.
 16  4    SEALING OF JUVENILE COURT RECORDS UNAVAILABLE FOR
 16  5 OPERATING=WHILE=INTOXICATED VIOLATIONS.  Under current Code
 16  6 section 232.150, a court shall order juvenile court records
 16  7 to be sealed if the person who is the subject of the juvenile
 16  8 court records is 18 years of age or older and 2 years have
 16  9 elapsed since the last official action in the person's case,
 16 10 the person has not been subsequently convicted of a felony
 16 11 or an aggravated or serious misdemeanor or adjudicated a
 16 12 delinquent child for an act which if committed by an adult
 16 13 would be a felony, an aggravated misdemeanor, or a serious
 16 14 misdemeanor and no proceeding is pending seeking such
 16 15 conviction or adjudication, and the person was not placed on
 16 16 youthful offender status, transferred back to district court
 16 17 after the youthful offender's 18th birthday, and sentenced for
 16 18 the offense which precipitated the youthful offender placement.
 16 19 The bill in newly designated Code section 232.150(4) provides
 16 20 that the court shall not seal a person's juvenile court records
 16 21 if the person was adjudicated delinquent for violating Code
 16 22 section 321J.2, which prohibits the operation of a motor
 16 23 vehicle while under the influence of alcohol or a drug.
 16 24    RELEASE OF CONFIDENTIAL RECORDS.  The bill provides that a
 16 25 public record which is confidential under the provisions of
 16 26 Code chapter 232 shall only be subject to release upon order of
 16 27 a court in a proceeding under Code chapter 232.
 16 28    EXISTING CONFIDENTIALITY EXEMPTIONS.  The bill retains
 16 29 certain existing exemptions to confidentiality of juvenile
 16 30 court records. Pursuant to Code section 692A.121(8), records

 13 19 OR EVIDENCE.  The bill in newly designated Code section
 13 20 232.147(13) provides that the confidentiality of a final
 13 21 adjudication of delinquency under Code section 232.147 or
 13 22 pursuant to Code section 232.149A shall not prohibit the state
 13 23 from pleading or proving the adjudication at a subsequent

 13 25 enhancement when a provision of the Code specifically deems the
 13 26 delinquency adjudication to constitute a final conviction.
 13 27    The bill in newly designated Code section 232.147(14)
 13 28 provides that the provisions of the bill shall not be construed
 13 29 to limit or restrict the production, use, or introduction
 13 30 of official juvenile court records in any juvenile or adult
 13 31 criminal proceeding, where such records are relevant and deemed
 13 32 admissible under any other provision of the law.
 13 33    CONFIDENTIALITY OF RECORDS AND FILES OF CRIMINAL OR
 13 34 JUVENILE JUSTICE AGENCIES.  Under current law, records and
 13 35 files of a criminal or juvenile justice agency concerning
 14  1 a child involved in a delinquent act are public records,
 14  2 subject to certain exceptions. The bill in Code section
 14  3 232.149 provides that the records and files of a criminal or
 14  4 juvenile justice agency, an intake officer, or a juvenile court
 14  5 officer concerning a child involved in a delinquent act are
 14  6 confidential. The bill further provides that the records of an
 14  7 intake officer or juvenile court officer containing a dismissal
 14  8 of a complaint or an informal adjustment of a complaint when
 14  9 no petition is filed relating to the complaint, shall not be
 14 10 available to the public, but may be disclosed to the judge and
 14 11 professional court staff, including juvenile court officers;
 14 12 the child's counsel or guardian ad litem; the county attorney
 14 13 and county attorney's assistants;  the superintendent or the
 14 14 superintendent's designee of the school district for the
 14 15 school attended by the child or the authorities in charge of
 14 16 an accredited nonpublic school attended by the child; a member
 14 17 of the armed forces of the United States who is conducting a
 14 18 background investigation of an individual pursuant to federal
 14 19 law; the statistical analysis center for the purposes stated
 14 20 in Code section 216A.136; the state public defender;  the
 14 21 department of human services; and the alleged victim of the
 14 22 delinquent act.
 14 23    PUBLIC RECORDS HEARINGS.  The bill enacts new Code section
 14 24 232.149B, which provides that a person may apply for a court
 14 25 order to make confidential juvenile court records public.
 14 26 The bill provides that a rebuttable presumption exists that
 14 27 official juvenile court records shall remain confidential. The
 14 28 bill provides that the court shall order the official juvenile
 14 29 court records in such a delinquency proceeding to be public
 14 30 records if either the public's interest in making the records
 14 31 public outweighs the juvenile's interest in maintaining the
 14 32 confidentiality of the records or the juvenile has been placed
 14 33 on youthful offender status pursuant to Code section 232.45(7)
 14 34 and Code section 907.3A(1), and will be transferred back to
 14 35 the district court for sentencing prior to the child's 18th
 15  1 birthday. The court may order the official juvenile court
 15  2 records in such a delinquency proceeding to be public records
 15  3 if the juvenile has been subsequently adjudicated delinquent
 15  4 for a public offense that would be a serious misdemeanor,
 15  5 aggravated misdemeanor, or felony offense if committed by an
 15  6 adult, or another delinquency proceeding is pending seeking
 15  7 such an adjudication. The bill provides that records subject
 15  8 to a public records order may be sealed at a later date
 15  9 pursuant to Code section 232.150.
 15 10    RIGHT TO REVIEW AND RELEASE A CONFIDENTIAL COMPLAINT.  The
 15 11 bill provides that delinquency complaints shall be released
 15 12 in accordance with Code section 915.25. Under current Code
 15 13 section 915.25, a complaint which alleges that a child who is
 15 14 at least 10 years of age committed a delinquent act, which if
 15 15 committed by an adult would be a public offense, is a public
 15 16 record. Current Code section 915.25 authorizes the court,
 15 17 its designee, or law enforcement officials to release such
 15 18 a complaint, including the identity of the child. The bill
 15 19 amends Code section 915.25 to provide that such a complaint
 15 20 is confidential unless the complaint alleges that the child
 15 21 committed a delinquent act that if committed by an adult would
 15 22 be a forcible felony. However, the bill authorizes state and
 15 23 local enforcement officials to release a confidential complaint
 15 24 against a child if the child is at large and doing so is deemed
 15 25 necessary for the protection of the public or the safety of
 15 26 the child. If the complaint is not confidential because the
 15 27 alleged delinquent act is an act that would be a forcible
 15 28 felony if committed by an adult, the court, its designee,
 15 29 or law enforcement officials may release such a complaint,
 15 30 including the identity of the child.
 15 31    The bill provides that an intake or juvenile court officer
 15 32 shall disclose to the alleged victim of a delinquent act, upon
 15 33 request, the complaint, the name and address of the child who
 15 34 allegedly committed the delinquent act, and the disposition
 15 35 of the complaint. If the alleged delinquent act would be
 16  1 a forcible felony if committed by an adult, the intake or
 16  2 juvenile court officer shall provide notification to the victim
 16  3 as required by Code section 915.24.
 16  4    SEALING OF JUVENILE COURT RECORDS UNAVAILABLE FOR
 16  5 OPERATING=WHILE=INTOXICATED VIOLATIONS.  Under current Code
 16  6 section 232.150, a court shall order juvenile court records
 16  7 to be sealed if the person who is the subject of the juvenile
 16  8 court records is 18 years of age or older and 2 years have
 16  9 elapsed since the last official action in the person's case,
 16 10 the person has not been subsequently convicted of a felony
 16 11 or an aggravated or serious misdemeanor or adjudicated a
 16 12 delinquent child for an act which if committed by an adult
 16 13 would be a felony, an aggravated misdemeanor, or a serious
 16 14 misdemeanor and no proceeding is pending seeking such
 16 15 conviction or adjudication, and the person was not placed on
 16 16 youthful offender status, transferred back to district court
 16 17 after the youthful offender's 18th birthday, and sentenced for
 16 18 the offense which precipitated the youthful offender placement.
 16 19 The bill in newly designated Code section 232.150(4) provides
 16 20 that the court shall not seal a person's juvenile court records
 16 21 if the person was adjudicated delinquent for violating Code
 16 22 section 321J.2, which prohibits the operation of a motor
 16 23 vehicle while under the influence of alcohol or a drug.
 16 24    RELEASE OF CONFIDENTIAL RECORDS.  The bill provides that a
 16 25 public record which is confidential under the provisions of
 16 26 Code chapter 232 shall only be subject to release upon order of
 16 27 a court in a proceeding under Code chapter 232.
 16 28    EXISTING CONFIDENTIALITY EXEMPTIONS.  The bill retains
 16 29 certain existing exemptions to confidentiality of juvenile
 16 30 court records. Pursuant to Code section 692A.121(8), records
 16 31 concerning sex offense convictions which are committed by
 16 32 minors may be released in the same manner as records of
 16 33 convictions of adults. Pursuant to Code section 915.10A,
 16 34 information concerning a juvenile charged with a felony offense
 16 35 may be released pursuant to an automated victim notification
 17  1 system. Under the bill, these exemptions to confidentiality
 17  2 are not amended and therefore still apply to juvenile court
 17  3 records.
 17  4    RIGHT TO COUNSEL.  The bill in Code section 232.11 provides
 17  5 that a child has the right to be represented by counsel at a
 17  6 hearing on a confidentiality order under Code section 232.149A
 17  7 or a public records order under Code section 232.149B.
 17  8    APPLICABILITY.  The bill applies to juvenile delinquency
 17  9 proceedings which are pending or arise on or after July 1,
 17 10 2016.

 12 17 state or local law enforcement agency; and the alleged victim
 12 18 of any delinquent act in the proceeding.
 12 19    The bill in newly designated Code section 232.147(3A)
 12 20 provides that juvenile court records containing a petition or
 12 21 complaint alleging the commission of a delinquent act that
 12 22 would be a forcible felony if committed by an adult shall be
 12 23 public records unless subject to a confidentiality order under
 12 24 Code section 232.149A or a sealing order under Code section
 12 25 232.150.  However, the bill provides that such official records
 12 26 shall not be available to the public or any governmental
 12 27 agency through the internet or in an electronic customized
 12 28 data report unless the child has been adjudicated delinquent
 12 29 in the matter.  Nevertheless, the bill provides that official
 12 30 juvenile court records may be disclosed without a court order
 12 31 through the internet or in an electronic customized data
 12 32 report prior to the child being adjudicated delinquent to the
 12 33 judge and professional court staff, including juvenile court
 12 34 officers; the child's counsel or guardian ad litem; the county
 12 35 attorney and the county attorney's assistants; a court, court
 13  1 professional staff, and adult probation officers in connection
 13  2 with the preparation of a presentence report concerning a
 13  3 person who prior thereto had been the subject of a juvenile
 13  4 court proceeding; a state or local law enforcement agency; the
 13  5 state public defender; the statistical analysis center for
 13  6 the purposes stated in Code section 216A.136; the department
 13  7 of human services; the department of corrections; a judicial
 13  8 district department of correctional services; and the board of
 13  9 parole.
 13 10    CONFIDENTIALITY OF TRANSCRIPTS.  The bill in newly
 13 11 designated Code section 232.147(3B) provides that if the court
 13 12 has excluded the public from a hearing pursuant to Code section
 13 13 232.39 or 232.92, the transcript of the proceedings shall not
 13 14 be deemed a public record and inspection and disclosure of
 13 15 the contents of the transcript shall not be permitted except
 13 16 pursuant to a court order or unless otherwise provided in Code
 13 17 chapter 232.
 13 18    USE OF ADJUDICATION OF DELINQUENCY FOR PENALTY ENHANCEMENTS
 13 19 OR EVIDENCE.  The bill in newly designated Code section
 13 20 232.147(13) provides that the confidentiality of a final
 13 21 adjudication of delinquency under Code section 232.147 or
 13 22 pursuant to Code section 232.149A shall not prohibit the state
 13 23 from pleading or proving the adjudication at a subsequent
 13 24 criminal or delinquency proceeding for the purpose of penalty
 13 25 enhancement when a provision of the Code specifically deems the
 13 26 delinquency adjudication to constitute a final conviction.
 13 27    The bill in newly designated Code section 232.147(14)
 13 28 provides that the provisions of the bill shall not be construed
 13 29 to limit or restrict the production, use, or introduction
 13 30 of official juvenile court records in any juvenile or adult
 13 31 criminal proceeding, where such records are relevant and deemed
 13 32 admissible under any other provision of the law.
 13 33    CONFIDENTIALITY OF RECORDS AND FILES OF CRIMINAL OR
 13 34 JUVENILE JUSTICE AGENCIES.  Under current law, records and
 13 35 files of a criminal or juvenile justice agency concerning
 14  1 a child involved in a delinquent act are public records,
 14  2 subject to certain exceptions. The bill in Code section
 14  3 232.149 provides that the records and files of a criminal or
 14  4 juvenile justice agency, an intake officer, or a juvenile court
 14  5 officer concerning a child involved in a delinquent act are
 14  6 confidential. The bill further provides that the records of an
 14  7 intake officer or juvenile court officer containing a dismissal
 14  8 of a complaint or an informal adjustment of a complaint when
 14  9 no petition is filed relating to the complaint, shall not be
 14 10 available to the public, but may be disclosed to the judge and
 14 11 professional court staff, including juvenile court officers;
 14 12 the child's counsel or guardian ad litem; the county attorney
 14 13 and county attorney's assistants;  the superintendent or the
 14 14 superintendent's designee of the school district for the
 14 15 school attended by the child or the authorities in charge of
 14 16 an accredited nonpublic school attended by the child; a member
 14 17 of the armed forces of the United States who is conducting a
 14 18 background investigation of an individual pursuant to federal
 14 19 law; the statistical analysis center for the purposes stated
 14 20 in Code section 216A.136; the state public defender;  the
 14 21 department of human services; and the alleged victim of the
 14 22 delinquent act.
 14 23    PUBLIC RECORDS HEARINGS.  The bill enacts new Code section
 14 24 232.149B, which provides that a person may apply for a court
 14 25 order to make confidential juvenile court records public.
 14 26 The bill provides that a rebuttable presumption exists that
 14 27 official juvenile court records shall remain confidential. The
 14 28 bill provides that the court shall order the official juvenile
 14 29 court records in such a delinquency proceeding to be public
 14 30 records if either the public's interest in making the records
 14 31 public outweighs the juvenile's interest in maintaining the
 14 32 confidentiality of the records or the juvenile has been placed
 14 33 on youthful offender status pursuant to Code section 232.45(7)
 14 34 and Code section 907.3A(1), and will be transferred back to
 14 35 the district court for sentencing prior to the child's 18th
 15  1 birthday. The court may order the official juvenile court
 15  2 records in such a delinquency proceeding to be public records
 15  3 if the juvenile has been subsequently adjudicated delinquent
 15  4 for a public offense that would be a serious misdemeanor,
 15  5 aggravated misdemeanor, or felony offense if committed by an
 15  6 adult, or another delinquency proceeding is pending seeking
 15  7 such an adjudication. The bill provides that records subject
 15  8 to a public records order may be sealed at a later date
 15  9 pursuant to Code section 232.150.
 15 10    RIGHT TO REVIEW AND RELEASE A CONFIDENTIAL COMPLAINT.  The
 15 11 bill provides that delinquency complaints shall be released
 15 12 in accordance with Code section 915.25. Under current Code
 15 13 section 915.25, a complaint which alleges that a child who is
 15 14 at least 10 years of age committed a delinquent act, which if
 15 15 committed by an adult would be a public offense, is a public
 15 16 record. Current Code section 915.25 authorizes the court,
 15 17 its designee, or law enforcement officials to release such
 15 18 a complaint, including the identity of the child. The bill
 15 19 amends Code section 915.25 to provide that such a complaint
 15 20 is confidential unless the complaint alleges that the child
 15 21 committed a delinquent act that if committed by an adult would
 15 22 be a forcible felony. However, the bill authorizes state and
 15 23 local enforcement officials to release a confidential complaint
 15 24 against a child if the child is at large and doing so is deemed
 15 25 necessary for the protection of the public or the safety of
 15 26 the child. If the complaint is not confidential because the
 15 27 alleged delinquent act is an act that would be a forcible
 15 28 felony if committed by an adult, the court, its designee,
 15 29 or law enforcement officials may release such a complaint,
 15 30 including the identity of the child.
 15 31    The bill provides that an intake or juvenile court officer
 15 32 shall disclose to the alleged victim of a delinquent act, upon
 15 33 request, the complaint, the name and address of the child who
 15 34 allegedly committed the delinquent act, and the disposition
 15 35 of the complaint. If the alleged delinquent act would be
 16  1 a forcible felony if committed by an adult, the intake or
 16  2 juvenile court officer shall provide notification to the victim
 16  3 as required by Code section 915.24.
 16  4    SEALING OF JUVENILE COURT RECORDS UNAVAILABLE FOR
 16  5 OPERATING=WHILE=INTOXICATED VIOLATIONS.  Under current Code
 16  6 section 232.150, a court shall order juvenile court records
 16  7 to be sealed if the person who is the subject of the juvenile
 16  8 court records is 18 years of age or older and 2 years have
 16  9 elapsed since the last official action in the person's case,
 16 10 the person has not been subsequently convicted of a felony
 16 11 or an aggravated or serious misdemeanor or adjudicated a
 16 12 delinquent child for an act which if committed by an adult
 16 13 would be a felony, an aggravated misdemeanor, or a serious
 16 14 misdemeanor and no proceeding is pending seeking such
 16 15 conviction or adjudication, and the person was not placed on
 16 16 youthful offender status, transferred back to district court
 16 17 after the youthful offender's 18th birthday, and sentenced for
 16 18 the offense which precipitated the youthful offender placement.
 16 19 The bill in newly designated Code section 232.150(4) provides
 16 20 that the court shall not seal a person's juvenile court records
 16 21 if the person was adjudicated delinquent for violating Code
 16 22 section 321J.2, which prohibits the operation of a motor
 16 23 vehicle while under the influence of alcohol or a drug.
 16 24    RELEASE OF CONFIDENTIAL RECORDS.  The bill provides that a
 16 25 public record which is confidential under the provisions of
 16 26 Code chapter 232 shall only be subject to release upon order of
 16 27 a court in a proceeding under Code chapter 232.
 16 28    EXISTING CONFIDENTIALITY EXEMPTIONS.  The bill retains
 16 29 certain existing exemptions to confidentiality of juvenile
 16 30 court records. Pursuant to Code section 692A.121(8), records
 16 31 concerning sex offense convictions which are committed by
 16 32 minors may be released in the same manner as records of
 16 33 convictions of adults. Pursuant to Code section 915.10A,
 16 34 information concerning a juvenile charged with a felony offense
 16 35 may be released pursuant to an automated victim notification
 17  1 system. Under the bill, these exemptions to confidentiality
 17  2 are not amended and therefore still apply to juvenile court
 17  3 records.
 17  4    RIGHT TO COUNSEL.  The bill in Code section 232.11 provides
 17  5 that a child has the right to be represented by counsel at a
 17  6 hearing on a confidentiality order under Code section 232.149A
 17  7 or a public records order under Code section 232.149B.

 13 21 adjudication of delinquency under Code section 232.147 or
 13 22 pursuant to Code section 232.149A shall not prohibit the state
 13 23 from pleading or proving the adjudication at a subsequent

 13 27    The bill in newly designated Code section 232.147(14)
 13 28 provides that the provisions of the bill shall not be construed

 13 30 of official juvenile court records in any juvenile or adult
 13 31 criminal proceeding, where such records are relevant and deemed
 13 32 admissible under any other provision of the law.
 13 33    CONFIDENTIALITY OF RECORDS AND FILES OF CRIMINAL OR
 13 34 JUVENILE JUSTICE AGENCIES.  Under current law, records and
 13 35 files of a criminal or juvenile justice agency concerning
 14  1 a child involved in a delinquent act are public records,
 14  2 subject to certain exceptions. The bill in Code section
 14  3 232.149 provides that the records and files of a criminal or
 14  4 juvenile justice agency, an intake officer, or a juvenile court
 14  5 officer concerning a child involved in a delinquent act are
 14  6 confidential. The bill further provides that the records of an
 14  7 intake officer or juvenile court officer containing a dismissal
 14  8 of a complaint or an informal adjustment of a complaint when
 14  9 no petition is filed relating to the complaint, shall not be
 14 10 available to the public, but may be disclosed to the judge and
 14 11 professional court staff, including juvenile court officers;
 14 12 the child's counsel or guardian ad litem; the county attorney
 14 13 and county attorney's assistants;  the superintendent or the

 14 21 department of human services; and the alleged victim of the
 14 22 delinquent act.
 14 23    PUBLIC RECORDS HEARINGS.  The bill enacts new Code section
 14 24 232.149B, which provides that a person may apply for a court
 14 25 order to make confidential juvenile court records public.
 14 26 The bill provides that a rebuttable presumption exists that
 14 27 official juvenile court records shall remain confidential. The
 14 28 bill provides that the court shall order the official juvenile
 14 29 court records in such a delinquency proceeding to be public
 14 30 records if either the public's interest in making the records
 14 31 public outweighs the juvenile's interest in maintaining the

 14 33 on youthful offender status pursuant to Code section 232.45(7)
 14 34 and Code section 907.3A(1), and will be transferred back to
 14 35 the district court for sentencing prior to the child's 18th
 15  1 birthday. The court may order the official juvenile court
 15  2 records in such a delinquency proceeding to be public records
 15  3 if the juvenile has been subsequently adjudicated delinquent
 15  4 for a public offense that would be a serious misdemeanor,
 15  5 aggravated misdemeanor, or felony offense if committed by an
 15  6 adult, or another delinquency proceeding is pending seeking
 15  7 such an adjudication. The bill provides that records subject
 15  8 to a public records order may be sealed at a later date
 15  9 pursuant to Code section 232.150.
 15 10    RIGHT TO REVIEW AND RELEASE A CONFIDENTIAL COMPLAINT.  The
 15 11 bill provides that delinquency complaints shall be released
 15 12 in accordance with Code section 915.25. Under current Code
 15 13 section 915.25, a complaint which alleges that a child who is
 15 14 at least 10 years of age committed a delinquent act, which if
 15 15 committed by an adult would be a public offense, is a public
 15 16 record. Current Code section 915.25 authorizes the court,
 15 17 its designee, or law enforcement officials to release such
 15 18 a complaint, including the identity of the child. The bill
 15 19 amends Code section 915.25 to provide that such a complaint
 15 20 is confidential unless the complaint alleges that the child
 15 21 committed a delinquent act that if committed by an adult would
 15 22 be a forcible felony. However, the bill authorizes state and
 15 23 local enforcement officials to release a confidential complaint
 15 24 against a child if the child is at large and doing so is deemed
 15 25 necessary for the protection of the public or the safety of
 15 26 the child. If the complaint is not confidential because the
 15 27 alleged delinquent act is an act that would be a forcible
 15 28 felony if committed by an adult, the court, its designee,
 15 29 or law enforcement officials may release such a complaint,
 15 30 including the identity of the child.
 15 31    The bill provides that an intake or juvenile court officer
 15 32 shall disclose to the alleged victim of a delinquent act, upon
 15 33 request, the complaint, the name and address of the child who
 15 34 allegedly committed the delinquent act, and the disposition
 15 35 of the complaint. If the alleged delinquent act would be
 16  1 a forcible felony if committed by an adult, the intake or
 16  2 juvenile court officer shall provide notification to the victim
 16  3 as required by Code section 915.24.
 16  4    SEALING OF JUVENILE COURT RECORDS UNAVAILABLE FOR
 16  5 OPERATING=WHILE=INTOXICATED VIOLATIONS.  Under current Code
 16  6 section 232.150, a court shall order juvenile court records
 16  7 to be sealed if the person who is the subject of the juvenile
 16  8 court records is 18 years of age or older and 2 years have
 16  9 elapsed since the last official action in the person's case,
 16 10 the person has not been subsequently convicted of a felony
 16 11 or an aggravated or serious misdemeanor or adjudicated a
 16 12 delinquent child for an act which if committed by an adult
 16 13 would be a felony, an aggravated misdemeanor, or a serious
 16 14 misdemeanor and no proceeding is pending seeking such
 16 15 conviction or adjudication, and the person was not placed on
 16 16 youthful offender status, transferred back to district court
 16 17 after the youthful offender's 18th birthday, and sentenced for
 16 18 the offense which precipitated the youthful offender placement.
 16 19 The bill in newly designated Code section 232.150(4) provides
 16 20 that the court shall not seal a person's juvenile court records
 16 21 if the person was adjudicated delinquent for violating Code
 16 22 section 321J.2, which prohibits the operation of a motor
 16 23 vehicle while under the influence of alcohol or a drug.
 16 24    RELEASE OF CONFIDENTIAL RECORDS.  The bill provides that a
 16 25 public record which is confidential under the provisions of
 16 26 Code chapter 232 shall only be subject to release upon order of
 16 27 a court in a proceeding under Code chapter 232.
 16 28    EXISTING CONFIDENTIALITY EXEMPTIONS.  The bill retains
 16 29 certain existing exemptions to confidentiality of juvenile
 16 30 court records. Pursuant to Code section 692A.121(8), records
 16 31 concerning sex offense convictions which are committed by
 16 32 minors may be released in the same manner as records of
 16 33 convictions of adults. Pursuant to Code section 915.10A,
 16 34 information concerning a juvenile charged with a felony offense
 16 35 may be released pursuant to an automated victim notification
 17  1 system. Under the bill, these exemptions to confidentiality
 17  2 are not amended and therefore still apply to juvenile court
 17  3 records.
 17  4    RIGHT TO COUNSEL.  The bill in Code section 232.11 provides
 17  5 that a child has the right to be represented by counsel at a
 17  6 hearing on a confidentiality order under Code section 232.149A
 17  7 or a public records order under Code section 232.149B.
 17  8    APPLICABILITY.  The bill applies to juvenile delinquency
 17  9 proceedings which are pending or arise on or after July 1,
 17 10 2016.

 12 18 of any delinquent act in the proceeding.
 12 19    The bill in newly designated Code section 232.147(3A)
 12 20 provides that juvenile court records containing a petition or
 12 21 complaint alleging the commission of a delinquent act that
 12 22 would be a forcible felony if committed by an adult shall be
 12 23 public records unless subject to a confidentiality order under
 12 24 Code section 232.149A or a sealing order under Code section
 12 25 232.150.  However, the bill provides that such official records
 12 26 shall not be available to the public or any governmental
 12 27 agency through the internet or in an electronic customized
 12 28 data report unless the child has been adjudicated delinquent
 12 29 in the matter.  Nevertheless, the bill provides that official
 12 30 juvenile court records may be disclosed without a court order
 12 31 through the internet or in an electronic customized data
 12 32 report prior to the child being adjudicated delinquent to the
 12 33 judge and professional court staff, including juvenile court
 12 34 officers; the child's counsel or guardian ad litem; the county
 12 35 attorney and the county attorney's assistants; a court, court
 13  1 professional staff, and adult probation officers in connection
 13  2 with the preparation of a presentence report concerning a
 13  3 person who prior thereto had been the subject of a juvenile
 13  4 court proceeding; a state or local law enforcement agency; the
 13  5 state public defender; the statistical analysis center for

 13  7 of human services; the department of corrections; a judicial
 13  8 district department of correctional services; and the board of
 13  9 parole.
 13 10    CONFIDENTIALITY OF TRANSCRIPTS.  The bill in newly
 13 11 designated Code section 232.147(3B) provides that if the court
 13 12 has excluded the public from a hearing pursuant to Code section
 13 13 232.39 or 232.92, the transcript of the proceedings shall not
 13 14 be deemed a public record and inspection and disclosure of
 13 15 the contents of the transcript shall not be permitted except
 13 16 pursuant to a court order or unless otherwise provided in Code
 13 17 chapter 232.
 13 18    USE OF ADJUDICATION OF DELINQUENCY FOR PENALTY ENHANCEMENTS
 13 19 OR EVIDENCE.  The bill in newly designated Code section
 13 20 232.147(13) provides that the confidentiality of a final
 13 21 adjudication of delinquency under Code section 232.147 or
 13 22 pursuant to Code section 232.149A shall not prohibit the state
 13 23 from pleading or proving the adjudication at a subsequent
 13 24 criminal or delinquency proceeding for the purpose of penalty
 13 25 enhancement when a provision of the Code specifically deems the
 13 26 delinquency adjudication to constitute a final conviction.
 13 27    The bill in newly designated Code section 232.147(14)
 13 28 provides that the provisions of the bill shall not be construed
 13 29 to limit or restrict the production, use, or introduction
 13 30 of official juvenile court records in any juvenile or adult
 13 31 criminal proceeding, where such records are relevant and deemed
 13 32 admissible under any other provision of the law.
 13 33    CONFIDENTIALITY OF RECORDS AND FILES OF CRIMINAL OR
 13 34 JUVENILE JUSTICE AGENCIES.  Under current law, records and
 13 35 files of a criminal or juvenile justice agency concerning
 14  1 a child involved in a delinquent act are public records,
 14  2 subject to certain exceptions. The bill in Code section
 14  3 232.149 provides that the records and files of a criminal or
 14  4 juvenile justice agency, an intake officer, or a juvenile court
 14  5 officer concerning a child involved in a delinquent act are
 14  6 confidential. The bill further provides that the records of an
 14  7 intake officer or juvenile court officer containing a dismissal
 14  8 of a complaint or an informal adjustment of a complaint when
 14  9 no petition is filed relating to the complaint, shall not be
 14 10 available to the public, but may be disclosed to the judge and
 14 11 professional court staff, including juvenile court officers;
 14 12 the child's counsel or guardian ad litem; the county attorney
 14 13 and county attorney's assistants;  the superintendent or the
 14 14 superintendent's designee of the school district for the
 14 15 school attended by the child or the authorities in charge of
 14 16 an accredited nonpublic school attended by the child; a member
 14 17 of the armed forces of the United States who is conducting a
 14 18 background investigation of an individual pursuant to federal
 14 19 law; the statistical analysis center for the purposes stated
 14 20 in Code section 216A.136; the state public defender;  the
 14 21 department of human services; and the alleged victim of the
 14 22 delinquent act.
 14 23    PUBLIC RECORDS HEARINGS.  The bill enacts new Code section
 14 24 232.149B, which provides that a person may apply for a court
 14 25 order to make confidential juvenile court records public.
 14 26 The bill provides that a rebuttable presumption exists that
 14 27 official juvenile court records shall remain confidential. The
 14 28 bill provides that the court shall order the official juvenile
 14 29 court records in such a delinquency proceeding to be public
 14 30 records if either the public's interest in making the records
 14 31 public outweighs the juvenile's interest in maintaining the
 14 32 confidentiality of the records or the juvenile has been placed
 14 33 on youthful offender status pursuant to Code section 232.45(7)
 14 34 and Code section 907.3A(1), and will be transferred back to
 14 35 the district court for sentencing prior to the child's 18th
 15  1 birthday. The court may order the official juvenile court
 15  2 records in such a delinquency proceeding to be public records
 15  3 if the juvenile has been subsequently adjudicated delinquent
 15  4 for a public offense that would be a serious misdemeanor,
 15  5 aggravated misdemeanor, or felony offense if committed by an
 15  6 adult, or another delinquency proceeding is pending seeking
 15  7 such an adjudication. The bill provides that records subject
 15  8 to a public records order may be sealed at a later date
 15  9 pursuant to Code section 232.150.
 15 10    RIGHT TO REVIEW AND RELEASE A CONFIDENTIAL COMPLAINT.  The
 15 11 bill provides that delinquency complaints shall be released
 15 12 in accordance with Code section 915.25. Under current Code
 15 13 section 915.25, a complaint which alleges that a child who is
 15 14 at least 10 years of age committed a delinquent act, which if
 15 15 committed by an adult would be a public offense, is a public
 15 16 record. Current Code section 915.25 authorizes the court,
 15 17 its designee, or law enforcement officials to release such
 15 18 a complaint, including the identity of the child. The bill
 15 19 amends Code section 915.25 to provide that such a complaint
 15 20 is confidential unless the complaint alleges that the child
 15 21 committed a delinquent act that if committed by an adult would
 15 22 be a forcible felony. However, the bill authorizes state and
 15 23 local enforcement officials to release a confidential complaint
 15 24 against a child if the child is at large and doing so is deemed
 15 25 necessary for the protection of the public or the safety of
 15 26 the child. If the complaint is not confidential because the
 15 27 alleged delinquent act is an act that would be a forcible
 15 28 felony if committed by an adult, the court, its designee,
 15 29 or law enforcement officials may release such a complaint,
 15 30 including the identity of the child.
 15 31    The bill provides that an intake or juvenile court officer
 15 32 shall disclose to the alleged victim of a delinquent act, upon
 15 33 request, the complaint, the name and address of the child who
 15 34 allegedly committed the delinquent act, and the disposition
 15 35 of the complaint. If the alleged delinquent act would be
 16  1 a forcible felony if committed by an adult, the intake or
 16  2 juvenile court officer shall provide notification to the victim
 16  3 as required by Code section 915.24.
 16  4    SEALING OF JUVENILE COURT RECORDS UNAVAILABLE FOR
 16  5 OPERATING=WHILE=INTOXICATED VIOLATIONS.  Under current Code
 16  6 section 232.150, a court shall order juvenile court records
 16  7 to be sealed if the person who is the subject of the juvenile
 16  8 court records is 18 years of age or older and 2 years have
 16  9 elapsed since the last official action in the person's case,
 16 10 the person has not been subsequently convicted of a felony
 16 11 or an aggravated or serious misdemeanor or adjudicated a
 16 12 delinquent child for an act which if committed by an adult
 16 13 would be a felony, an aggravated misdemeanor, or a serious
 16 14 misdemeanor and no proceeding is pending seeking such
 16 15 conviction or adjudication, and the person was not placed on
 16 16 youthful offender status, transferred back to district court
 16 17 after the youthful offender's 18th birthday, and sentenced for
 16 18 the offense which precipitated the youthful offender placement.
 16 19 The bill in newly designated Code section 232.150(4) provides
 16 20 that the court shall not seal a person's juvenile court records
 16 21 if the person was adjudicated delinquent for violating Code
 16 22 section 321J.2, which prohibits the operation of a motor
 16 23 vehicle while under the influence of alcohol or a drug.
 16 24    RELEASE OF CONFIDENTIAL RECORDS.  The bill provides that a
 16 25 public record which is confidential under the provisions of
 16 26 Code chapter 232 shall only be subject to release upon order of
 16 27 a court in a proceeding under Code chapter 232.
 16 28    EXISTING CONFIDENTIALITY EXEMPTIONS.  The bill retains
 16 29 certain existing exemptions to confidentiality of juvenile
 16 30 court records. Pursuant to Code section 692A.121(8), records
 16 31 concerning sex offense convictions which are committed by
 16 32 minors may be released in the same manner as records of
 16 33 convictions of adults. Pursuant to Code section 915.10A,
 16 34 information concerning a juvenile charged with a felony offense
 16 35 may be released pursuant to an automated victim notification
 17  1 system. Under the bill, these exemptions to confidentiality
 17  2 are not amended and therefore still apply to juvenile court
 17  3 records.
 17  4    RIGHT TO COUNSEL.  The bill in Code section 232.11 provides
 17  5 that a child has the right to be represented by counsel at a
 17  6 hearing on a confidentiality order under Code section 232.149A
 17  7 or a public records order under Code section 232.149B.

 13 10    CONFIDENTIALITY OF TRANSCRIPTS.  The bill in newly

 13 23 from pleading or proving the adjudication at a subsequent

 13 30 of official juvenile court records in any juvenile or adult

 13 32 admissible under any other provision of the law.
 13 33    CONFIDENTIALITY OF RECORDS AND FILES OF CRIMINAL OR
 13 34 JUVENILE JUSTICE AGENCIES.  Under current law, records and
 13 35 files of a criminal or juvenile justice agency concerning
 14  1 a child involved in a delinquent act are public records,
 14  2 subject to certain exceptions. The bill in Code section
 14  3 232.149 provides that the records and files of a criminal or
 14  4 juvenile justice agency, an intake officer, or a juvenile court
 14  5 officer concerning a child involved in a delinquent act are
 14  6 confidential. The bill further provides that the records of an

 14  8 of a complaint or an informal adjustment of a complaint when
 14  9 no petition is filed relating to the complaint, shall not be

 14 21 department of human services; and the alleged victim of the
 14 22 delinquent act.
 14 23    PUBLIC RECORDS HEARINGS.  The bill enacts new Code section
 14 24 232.149B, which provides that a person may apply for a court
 14 25 order to make confidential juvenile court records public.
 14 26 The bill provides that a rebuttable presumption exists that
 14 27 official juvenile court records shall remain confidential. The
 14 28 bill provides that the court shall order the official juvenile
 14 29 court records in such a delinquency proceeding to be public
 14 30 records if either the public's interest in making the records
 14 31 public outweighs the juvenile's interest in maintaining the

 14 33 on youthful offender status pursuant to Code section 232.45(7)
 14 34 and Code section 907.3A(1), and will be transferred back to

 15  3 if the juvenile has been subsequently adjudicated delinquent
 15  4 for a public offense that would be a serious misdemeanor,
 15  5 aggravated misdemeanor, or felony offense if committed by an
 15  6 adult, or another delinquency proceeding is pending seeking
 15  7 such an adjudication. The bill provides that records subject
 15  8 to a public records order may be sealed at a later date
 15  9 pursuant to Code section 232.150.
 15 10    RIGHT TO REVIEW AND RELEASE A CONFIDENTIAL COMPLAINT.  The
 15 11 bill provides that delinquency complaints shall be released
 15 12 in accordance with Code section 915.25. Under current Code
 15 13 section 915.25, a complaint which alleges that a child who is
 15 14 at least 10 years of age committed a delinquent act, which if
 15 15 committed by an adult would be a public offense, is a public
 15 16 record. Current Code section 915.25 authorizes the court,
 15 17 its designee, or law enforcement officials to release such
 15 18 a complaint, including the identity of the child. The bill
 15 19 amends Code section 915.25 to provide that such a complaint
 15 20 is confidential unless the complaint alleges that the child
 15 21 committed a delinquent act that if committed by an adult would
 15 22 be a forcible felony. However, the bill authorizes state and
 15 23 local enforcement officials to release a confidential complaint
 15 24 against a child if the child is at large and doing so is deemed
 15 25 necessary for the protection of the public or the safety of
 15 26 the child. If the complaint is not confidential because the
 15 27 alleged delinquent act is an act that would be a forcible
 15 28 felony if committed by an adult, the court, its designee,
 15 29 or law enforcement officials may release such a complaint,
 15 30 including the identity of the child.
 15 31    The bill provides that an intake or juvenile court officer
 15 32 shall disclose to the alleged victim of a delinquent act, upon
 15 33 request, the complaint, the name and address of the child who
 15 34 allegedly committed the delinquent act, and the disposition
 15 35 of the complaint. If the alleged delinquent act would be
 16  1 a forcible felony if committed by an adult, the intake or
 16  2 juvenile court officer shall provide notification to the victim
 16  3 as required by Code section 915.24.
 16  4    SEALING OF JUVENILE COURT RECORDS UNAVAILABLE FOR
 16  5 OPERATING=WHILE=INTOXICATED VIOLATIONS.  Under current Code
 16  6 section 232.150, a court shall order juvenile court records
 16  7 to be sealed if the person who is the subject of the juvenile
 16  8 court records is 18 years of age or older and 2 years have
 16  9 elapsed since the last official action in the person's case,
 16 10 the person has not been subsequently convicted of a felony
 16 11 or an aggravated or serious misdemeanor or adjudicated a
 16 12 delinquent child for an act which if committed by an adult
 16 13 would be a felony, an aggravated misdemeanor, or a serious
 16 14 misdemeanor and no proceeding is pending seeking such
 16 15 conviction or adjudication, and the person was not placed on
 16 16 youthful offender status, transferred back to district court
 16 17 after the youthful offender's 18th birthday, and sentenced for
 16 18 the offense which precipitated the youthful offender placement.
 16 19 The bill in newly designated Code section 232.150(4) provides
 16 20 that the court shall not seal a person's juvenile court records
 16 21 if the person was adjudicated delinquent for violating Code
 16 22 section 321J.2, which prohibits the operation of a motor
 16 23 vehicle while under the influence of alcohol or a drug.
 16 24    RELEASE OF CONFIDENTIAL RECORDS.  The bill provides that a

 16 26 Code chapter 232 shall only be subject to release upon order of
 16 27 a court in a proceeding under Code chapter 232.
 16 28    EXISTING CONFIDENTIALITY EXEMPTIONS.  The bill retains
 16 29 certain existing exemptions to confidentiality of juvenile
 16 30 court records. Pursuant to Code section 692A.121(8), records
 16 31 concerning sex offense convictions which are committed by
 16 32 minors may be released in the same manner as records of
 16 33 convictions of adults. Pursuant to Code section 915.10A,
 16 34 information concerning a juvenile charged with a felony offense
 16 35 may be released pursuant to an automated victim notification
 17  1 system. Under the bill, these exemptions to confidentiality
 17  2 are not amended and therefore still apply to juvenile court
 17  3 records.
 17  4    RIGHT TO COUNSEL.  The bill in Code section 232.11 provides
 17  5 that a child has the right to be represented by counsel at a
 17  6 hearing on a confidentiality order under Code section 232.149A
 17  7 or a public records order under Code section 232.149B.
 17  8    APPLICABILITY.  The bill applies to juvenile delinquency

 12 19    The bill in newly designated Code section 232.147(3A)
 12 20 provides that juvenile court records containing a petition or
 12 21 complaint alleging the commission of a delinquent act that
 12 22 would be a forcible felony if committed by an adult shall be
 12 23 public records unless subject to a confidentiality order under
 12 24 Code section 232.149A or a sealing order under Code section
 12 25 232.150.  However, the bill provides that such official records
 12 26 shall not be available to the public or any governmental
 12 27 agency through the internet or in an electronic customized
 12 28 data report unless the child has been adjudicated delinquent
 12 29 in the matter.  Nevertheless, the bill provides that official
 12 30 juvenile court records may be disclosed without a court order
 12 31 through the internet or in an electronic customized data
 12 32 report prior to the child being adjudicated delinquent to the
 12 33 judge and professional court staff, including juvenile court
 12 34 officers; the child's counsel or guardian ad litem; the county
 12 35 attorney and the county attorney's assistants; a court, court
 13  1 professional staff, and adult probation officers in connection
 13  2 with the preparation of a presentence report concerning a
 13  3 person who prior thereto had been the subject of a juvenile

 13 10    CONFIDENTIALITY OF TRANSCRIPTS.  The bill in newly
 13 11 designated Code section 232.147(3B) provides that if the court
 13 12 has excluded the public from a hearing pursuant to Code section
 13 13 232.39 or 232.92, the transcript of the proceedings shall not
 13 14 be deemed a public record and inspection and disclosure of
 13 15 the contents of the transcript shall not be permitted except
 13 16 pursuant to a court order or unless otherwise provided in Code
 13 17 chapter 232.
 13 18    USE OF ADJUDICATION OF DELINQUENCY FOR PENALTY ENHANCEMENTS
 13 19 OR EVIDENCE.  The bill in newly designated Code section
 13 20 232.147(13) provides that the confidentiality of a final
 13 21 adjudication of delinquency under Code section 232.147 or
 13 22 pursuant to Code section 232.149A shall not prohibit the state
 13 23 from pleading or proving the adjudication at a subsequent
 13 24 criminal or delinquency proceeding for the purpose of penalty
 13 25 enhancement when a provision of the Code specifically deems the
 13 26 delinquency adjudication to constitute a final conviction.
 13 27    The bill in newly designated Code section 232.147(14)
 13 28 provides that the provisions of the bill shall not be construed
 13 29 to limit or restrict the production, use, or introduction
 13 30 of official juvenile court records in any juvenile or adult
 13 31 criminal proceeding, where such records are relevant and deemed
 13 32 admissible under any other provision of the law.
 13 33    CONFIDENTIALITY OF RECORDS AND FILES OF CRIMINAL OR
 13 34 JUVENILE JUSTICE AGENCIES.  Under current law, records and
 13 35 files of a criminal or juvenile justice agency concerning
 14  1 a child involved in a delinquent act are public records,
 14  2 subject to certain exceptions. The bill in Code section
 14  3 232.149 provides that the records and files of a criminal or
 14  4 juvenile justice agency, an intake officer, or a juvenile court
 14  5 officer concerning a child involved in a delinquent act are
 14  6 confidential. The bill further provides that the records of an
 14  7 intake officer or juvenile court officer containing a dismissal
 14  8 of a complaint or an informal adjustment of a complaint when
 14  9 no petition is filed relating to the complaint, shall not be
 14 10 available to the public, but may be disclosed to the judge and
 14 11 professional court staff, including juvenile court officers;
 14 12 the child's counsel or guardian ad litem; the county attorney
 14 13 and county attorney's assistants;  the superintendent or the
 14 14 superintendent's designee of the school district for the
 14 15 school attended by the child or the authorities in charge of
 14 16 an accredited nonpublic school attended by the child; a member
 14 17 of the armed forces of the United States who is conducting a
 14 18 background investigation of an individual pursuant to federal
 14 19 law; the statistical analysis center for the purposes stated
 14 20 in Code section 216A.136; the state public defender;  the
 14 21 department of human services; and the alleged victim of the
 14 22 delinquent act.
 14 23    PUBLIC RECORDS HEARINGS.  The bill enacts new Code section
 14 24 232.149B, which provides that a person may apply for a court
 14 25 order to make confidential juvenile court records public.
 14 26 The bill provides that a rebuttable presumption exists that
 14 27 official juvenile court records shall remain confidential. The
 14 28 bill provides that the court shall order the official juvenile
 14 29 court records in such a delinquency proceeding to be public
 14 30 records if either the public's interest in making the records
 14 31 public outweighs the juvenile's interest in maintaining the
 14 32 confidentiality of the records or the juvenile has been placed
 14 33 on youthful offender status pursuant to Code section 232.45(7)
 14 34 and Code section 907.3A(1), and will be transferred back to
 14 35 the district court for sentencing prior to the child's 18th
 15  1 birthday. The court may order the official juvenile court
 15  2 records in such a delinquency proceeding to be public records
 15  3 if the juvenile has been subsequently adjudicated delinquent
 15  4 for a public offense that would be a serious misdemeanor,
 15  5 aggravated misdemeanor, or felony offense if committed by an
 15  6 adult, or another delinquency proceeding is pending seeking
 15  7 such an adjudication. The bill provides that records subject
 15  8 to a public records order may be sealed at a later date
 15  9 pursuant to Code section 232.150.
 15 10    RIGHT TO REVIEW AND RELEASE A CONFIDENTIAL COMPLAINT.  The
 15 11 bill provides that delinquency complaints shall be released
 15 12 in accordance with Code section 915.25. Under current Code
 15 13 section 915.25, a complaint which alleges that a child who is
 15 14 at least 10 years of age committed a delinquent act, which if
 15 15 committed by an adult would be a public offense, is a public
 15 16 record. Current Code section 915.25 authorizes the court,
 15 17 its designee, or law enforcement officials to release such
 15 18 a complaint, including the identity of the child. The bill
 15 19 amends Code section 915.25 to provide that such a complaint
 15 20 is confidential unless the complaint alleges that the child
 15 21 committed a delinquent act that if committed by an adult would
 15 22 be a forcible felony. However, the bill authorizes state and
 15 23 local enforcement officials to release a confidential complaint
 15 24 against a child if the child is at large and doing so is deemed
 15 25 necessary for the protection of the public or the safety of
 15 26 the child. If the complaint is not confidential because the
 15 27 alleged delinquent act is an act that would be a forcible
 15 28 felony if committed by an adult, the court, its designee,
 15 29 or law enforcement officials may release such a complaint,
 15 30 including the identity of the child.
 15 31    The bill provides that an intake or juvenile court officer
 15 32 shall disclose to the alleged victim of a delinquent act, upon
 15 33 request, the complaint, the name and address of the child who
 15 34 allegedly committed the delinquent act, and the disposition
 15 35 of the complaint. If the alleged delinquent act would be
 16  1 a forcible felony if committed by an adult, the intake or
 16  2 juvenile court officer shall provide notification to the victim
 16  3 as required by Code section 915.24.
 16  4    SEALING OF JUVENILE COURT RECORDS UNAVAILABLE FOR
 16  5 OPERATING=WHILE=INTOXICATED VIOLATIONS.  Under current Code
 16  6 section 232.150, a court shall order juvenile court records
 16  7 to be sealed if the person who is the subject of the juvenile
 16  8 court records is 18 years of age or older and 2 years have
 16  9 elapsed since the last official action in the person's case,
 16 10 the person has not been subsequently convicted of a felony
 16 11 or an aggravated or serious misdemeanor or adjudicated a
 16 12 delinquent child for an act which if committed by an adult
 16 13 would be a felony, an aggravated misdemeanor, or a serious
 16 14 misdemeanor and no proceeding is pending seeking such
 16 15 conviction or adjudication, and the person was not placed on
 16 16 youthful offender status, transferred back to district court
 16 17 after the youthful offender's 18th birthday, and sentenced for
 16 18 the offense which precipitated the youthful offender placement.
 16 19 The bill in newly designated Code section 232.150(4) provides
 16 20 that the court shall not seal a person's juvenile court records
 16 21 if the person was adjudicated delinquent for violating Code
 16 22 section 321J.2, which prohibits the operation of a motor
 16 23 vehicle while under the influence of alcohol or a drug.
 16 24    RELEASE OF CONFIDENTIAL RECORDS.  The bill provides that a
 16 25 public record which is confidential under the provisions of
 16 26 Code chapter 232 shall only be subject to release upon order of
 16 27 a court in a proceeding under Code chapter 232.
 16 28    EXISTING CONFIDENTIALITY EXEMPTIONS.  The bill retains
 16 29 certain existing exemptions to confidentiality of juvenile
 16 30 court records. Pursuant to Code section 692A.121(8), records
 16 31 concerning sex offense convictions which are committed by
 16 32 minors may be released in the same manner as records of
 16 33 convictions of adults. Pursuant to Code section 915.10A,
 16 34 information concerning a juvenile charged with a felony offense
 16 35 may be released pursuant to an automated victim notification
 17  1 system. Under the bill, these exemptions to confidentiality
 17  2 are not amended and therefore still apply to juvenile court
 17  3 records.
 17  4    RIGHT TO COUNSEL.  The bill in Code section 232.11 provides
 17  5 that a child has the right to be represented by counsel at a
 17  6 hearing on a confidentiality order under Code section 232.149A
 17  7 or a public records order under Code section 232.149B.
 17  8    APPLICABILITY.  The bill applies to juvenile delinquency

 12 19    The bill in newly designated Code section 232.147(3A)
 12 20 provides that juvenile court records containing a petition or
 12 21 complaint alleging the commission of a delinquent act that
 12 22 would be a forcible felony if committed by an adult shall be
 12 23 public records unless subject to a confidentiality order under
 12 24 Code section 232.149A or a sealing order under Code section

 12 26 shall not be available to the public or any governmental

 12 35 attorney and the county attorney's assistants; a court, court
 13  1 professional staff, and adult probation officers in connection
 13  2 with the preparation of a presentence report concerning a

 13  6 the purposes stated in Code section 216A.136; the department
 13  7 of human services; the department of corrections; a judicial
 13  8 district department of correctional services; and the board of
 13  9 parole.
 13 10    CONFIDENTIALITY OF TRANSCRIPTS.  The bill in newly
 13 11 designated Code section 232.147(3B) provides that if the court
 13 12 has excluded the public from a hearing pursuant to Code section
 13 13 232.39 or 232.92, the transcript of the proceedings shall not
 13 14 be deemed a public record and inspection and disclosure of
 13 15 the contents of the transcript shall not be permitted except
 13 16 pursuant to a court order or unless otherwise provided in Code
 13 17 chapter 232.
 13 18    USE OF ADJUDICATION OF DELINQUENCY FOR PENALTY ENHANCEMENTS
 13 19 OR EVIDENCE.  The bill in newly designated Code section
 13 20 232.147(13) provides that the confidentiality of a final
 13 21 adjudication of delinquency under Code section 232.147 or
 13 22 pursuant to Code section 232.149A shall not prohibit the state
 13 23 from pleading or proving the adjudication at a subsequent
 13 24 criminal or delinquency proceeding for the purpose of penalty
 13 25 enhancement when a provision of the Code specifically deems the
 13 26 delinquency adjudication to constitute a final conviction.
 13 27    The bill in newly designated Code section 232.147(14)
 13 28 provides that the provisions of the bill shall not be construed
 13 29 to limit or restrict the production, use, or introduction
 13 30 of official juvenile court records in any juvenile or adult
 13 31 criminal proceeding, where such records are relevant and deemed
 13 32 admissible under any other provision of the law.
 13 33    CONFIDENTIALITY OF RECORDS AND FILES OF CRIMINAL OR
 13 34 JUVENILE JUSTICE AGENCIES.  Under current law, records and
 13 35 files of a criminal or juvenile justice agency concerning
 14  1 a child involved in a delinquent act are public records,
 14  2 subject to certain exceptions. The bill in Code section
 14  3 232.149 provides that the records and files of a criminal or
 14  4 juvenile justice agency, an intake officer, or a juvenile court
 14  5 officer concerning a child involved in a delinquent act are
 14  6 confidential. The bill further provides that the records of an
 14  7 intake officer or juvenile court officer containing a dismissal
 14  8 of a complaint or an informal adjustment of a complaint when
 14  9 no petition is filed relating to the complaint, shall not be
 14 10 available to the public, but may be disclosed to the judge and
 14 11 professional court staff, including juvenile court officers;
 14 12 the child's counsel or guardian ad litem; the county attorney
 14 13 and county attorney's assistants;  the superintendent or the
 14 14 superintendent's designee of the school district for the
 14 15 school attended by the child or the authorities in charge of
 14 16 an accredited nonpublic school attended by the child; a member
 14 17 of the armed forces of the United States who is conducting a
 14 18 background investigation of an individual pursuant to federal
 14 19 law; the statistical analysis center for the purposes stated
 14 20 in Code section 216A.136; the state public defender;  the
 14 21 department of human services; and the alleged victim of the
 14 22 delinquent act.
 14 23    PUBLIC RECORDS HEARINGS.  The bill enacts new Code section
 14 24 232.149B, which provides that a person may apply for a court
 14 25 order to make confidential juvenile court records public.
 14 26 The bill provides that a rebuttable presumption exists that
 14 27 official juvenile court records shall remain confidential. The
 14 28 bill provides that the court shall order the official juvenile
 14 29 court records in such a delinquency proceeding to be public
 14 30 records if either the public's interest in making the records
 14 31 public outweighs the juvenile's interest in maintaining the
 14 32 confidentiality of the records or the juvenile has been placed
 14 33 on youthful offender status pursuant to Code section 232.45(7)
 14 34 and Code section 907.3A(1), and will be transferred back to
 14 35 the district court for sentencing prior to the child's 18th
 15  1 birthday. The court may order the official juvenile court
 15  2 records in such a delinquency proceeding to be public records
 15  3 if the juvenile has been subsequently adjudicated delinquent
 15  4 for a public offense that would be a serious misdemeanor,
 15  5 aggravated misdemeanor, or felony offense if committed by an
 15  6 adult, or another delinquency proceeding is pending seeking
 15  7 such an adjudication. The bill provides that records subject
 15  8 to a public records order may be sealed at a later date
 15  9 pursuant to Code section 232.150.
 15 10    RIGHT TO REVIEW AND RELEASE A CONFIDENTIAL COMPLAINT.  The
 15 11 bill provides that delinquency complaints shall be released
 15 12 in accordance with Code section 915.25. Under current Code
 15 13 section 915.25, a complaint which alleges that a child who is
 15 14 at least 10 years of age committed a delinquent act, which if
 15 15 committed by an adult would be a public offense, is a public
 15 16 record. Current Code section 915.25 authorizes the court,
 15 17 its designee, or law enforcement officials to release such
 15 18 a complaint, including the identity of the child. The bill
 15 19 amends Code section 915.25 to provide that such a complaint
 15 20 is confidential unless the complaint alleges that the child
 15 21 committed a delinquent act that if committed by an adult would
 15 22 be a forcible felony. However, the bill authorizes state and
 15 23 local enforcement officials to release a confidential complaint
 15 24 against a child if the child is at large and doing so is deemed
 15 25 necessary for the protection of the public or the safety of
 15 26 the child. If the complaint is not confidential because the
 15 27 alleged delinquent act is an act that would be a forcible
 15 28 felony if committed by an adult, the court, its designee,
 15 29 or law enforcement officials may release such a complaint,
 15 30 including the identity of the child.
 15 31    The bill provides that an intake or juvenile court officer
 15 32 shall disclose to the alleged victim of a delinquent act, upon
 15 33 request, the complaint, the name and address of the child who
 15 34 allegedly committed the delinquent act, and the disposition
 15 35 of the complaint. If the alleged delinquent act would be
 16  1 a forcible felony if committed by an adult, the intake or
 16  2 juvenile court officer shall provide notification to the victim
 16  3 as required by Code section 915.24.
 16  4    SEALING OF JUVENILE COURT RECORDS UNAVAILABLE FOR
 16  5 OPERATING=WHILE=INTOXICATED VIOLATIONS.  Under current Code
 16  6 section 232.150, a court shall order juvenile court records
 16  7 to be sealed if the person who is the subject of the juvenile
 16  8 court records is 18 years of age or older and 2 years have
 16  9 elapsed since the last official action in the person's case,
 16 10 the person has not been subsequently convicted of a felony
 16 11 or an aggravated or serious misdemeanor or adjudicated a
 16 12 delinquent child for an act which if committed by an adult
 16 13 would be a felony, an aggravated misdemeanor, or a serious
 16 14 misdemeanor and no proceeding is pending seeking such
 16 15 conviction or adjudication, and the person was not placed on
 16 16 youthful offender status, transferred back to district court
 16 17 after the youthful offender's 18th birthday, and sentenced for
 16 18 the offense which precipitated the youthful offender placement.
 16 19 The bill in newly designated Code section 232.150(4) provides
 16 20 that the court shall not seal a person's juvenile court records
 16 21 if the person was adjudicated delinquent for violating Code
 16 22 section 321J.2, which prohibits the operation of a motor
 16 23 vehicle while under the influence of alcohol or a drug.
 16 24    RELEASE OF CONFIDENTIAL RECORDS.  The bill provides that a
 16 25 public record which is confidential under the provisions of
 16 26 Code chapter 232 shall only be subject to release upon order of
 16 27 a court in a proceeding under Code chapter 232.
 16 28    EXISTING CONFIDENTIALITY EXEMPTIONS.  The bill retains
 16 29 certain existing exemptions to confidentiality of juvenile
 16 30 court records. Pursuant to Code section 692A.121(8), records
 16 31 concerning sex offense convictions which are committed by
 16 32 minors may be released in the same manner as records of
 16 33 convictions of adults. Pursuant to Code section 915.10A,
 16 34 information concerning a juvenile charged with a felony offense
 16 35 may be released pursuant to an automated victim notification
 17  1 system. Under the bill, these exemptions to confidentiality
 17  2 are not amended and therefore still apply to juvenile court
 17  3 records.
 17  4    RIGHT TO COUNSEL.  The bill in Code section 232.11 provides
 17  5 that a child has the right to be represented by counsel at a
 17  6 hearing on a confidentiality order under Code section 232.149A
 17  7 or a public records order under Code section 232.149B.

 13  6 the purposes stated in Code section 216A.136; the department
 13  7 of human services; the department of corrections; a judicial
 13  8 district department of correctional services; and the board of
 13  9 parole.
 13 10    CONFIDENTIALITY OF TRANSCRIPTS.  The bill in newly
 13 11 designated Code section 232.147(3B) provides that if the court
 13 12 has excluded the public from a hearing pursuant to Code section
 13 13 232.39 or 232.92, the transcript of the proceedings shall not
 13 14 be deemed a public record and inspection and disclosure of
 13 15 the contents of the transcript shall not be permitted except
 13 16 pursuant to a court order or unless otherwise provided in Code
 13 17 chapter 232.
 13 18    USE OF ADJUDICATION OF DELINQUENCY FOR PENALTY ENHANCEMENTS
 13 19 OR EVIDENCE.  The bill in newly designated Code section
 13 20 232.147(13) provides that the confidentiality of a final
 13 21 adjudication of delinquency under Code section 232.147 or
 13 22 pursuant to Code section 232.149A shall not prohibit the state
 13 23 from pleading or proving the adjudication at a subsequent
 13 24 criminal or delinquency proceeding for the purpose of penalty
 13 25 enhancement when a provision of the Code specifically deems the
 13 26 delinquency adjudication to constitute a final conviction.
 13 27    The bill in newly designated Code section 232.147(14)
 13 28 provides that the provisions of the bill shall not be construed
 13 29 to limit or restrict the production, use, or introduction
 13 30 of official juvenile court records in any juvenile or adult
 13 31 criminal proceeding, where such records are relevant and deemed
 13 32 admissible under any other provision of the law.
 13 33    CONFIDENTIALITY OF RECORDS AND FILES OF CRIMINAL OR
 13 34 JUVENILE JUSTICE AGENCIES.  Under current law, records and
 13 35 files of a criminal or juvenile justice agency concerning
 14  1 a child involved in a delinquent act are public records,
 14  2 subject to certain exceptions. The bill in Code section
 14  3 232.149 provides that the records and files of a criminal or
 14  4 juvenile justice agency, an intake officer, or a juvenile court
 14  5 officer concerning a child involved in a delinquent act are
 14  6 confidential. The bill further provides that the records of an
 14  7 intake officer or juvenile court officer containing a dismissal
 14  8 of a complaint or an informal adjustment of a complaint when
 14  9 no petition is filed relating to the complaint, shall not be
 14 10 available to the public, but may be disclosed to the judge and
 14 11 professional court staff, including juvenile court officers;
 14 12 the child's counsel or guardian ad litem; the county attorney
 14 13 and county attorney's assistants;  the superintendent or the
 14 14 superintendent's designee of the school district for the
 14 15 school attended by the child or the authorities in charge of
 14 16 an accredited nonpublic school attended by the child; a member
 14 17 of the armed forces of the United States who is conducting a
 14 18 background investigation of an individual pursuant to federal
 14 19 law; the statistical analysis center for the purposes stated
 14 20 in Code section 216A.136; the state public defender;  the
 14 21 department of human services; and the alleged victim of the
 14 22 delinquent act.
 14 23    PUBLIC RECORDS HEARINGS.  The bill enacts new Code section
 14 24 232.149B, which provides that a person may apply for a court
 14 25 order to make confidential juvenile court records public.
 14 26 The bill provides that a rebuttable presumption exists that
 14 27 official juvenile court records shall remain confidential. The
 14 28 bill provides that the court shall order the official juvenile
 14 29 court records in such a delinquency proceeding to be public
 14 30 records if either the public's interest in making the records
 14 31 public outweighs the juvenile's interest in maintaining the
 14 32 confidentiality of the records or the juvenile has been placed
 14 33 on youthful offender status pursuant to Code section 232.45(7)
 14 34 and Code section 907.3A(1), and will be transferred back to
 14 35 the district court for sentencing prior to the child's 18th
 15  1 birthday. The court may order the official juvenile court
 15  2 records in such a delinquency proceeding to be public records
 15  3 if the juvenile has been subsequently adjudicated delinquent
 15  4 for a public offense that would be a serious misdemeanor,
 15  5 aggravated misdemeanor, or felony offense if committed by an
 15  6 adult, or another delinquency proceeding is pending seeking
 15  7 such an adjudication. The bill provides that records subject
 15  8 to a public records order may be sealed at a later date
 15  9 pursuant to Code section 232.150.
 15 10    RIGHT TO REVIEW AND RELEASE A CONFIDENTIAL COMPLAINT.  The
 15 11 bill provides that delinquency complaints shall be released
 15 12 in accordance with Code section 915.25. Under current Code
 15 13 section 915.25, a complaint which alleges that a child who is
 15 14 at least 10 years of age committed a delinquent act, which if
 15 15 committed by an adult would be a public offense, is a public
 15 16 record. Current Code section 915.25 authorizes the court,
 15 17 its designee, or law enforcement officials to release such
 15 18 a complaint, including the identity of the child. The bill
 15 19 amends Code section 915.25 to provide that such a complaint
 15 20 is confidential unless the complaint alleges that the child
 15 21 committed a delinquent act that if committed by an adult would
 15 22 be a forcible felony. However, the bill authorizes state and
 15 23 local enforcement officials to release a confidential complaint
 15 24 against a child if the child is at large and doing so is deemed
 15 25 necessary for the protection of the public or the safety of
 15 26 the child. If the complaint is not confidential because the
 15 27 alleged delinquent act is an act that would be a forcible
 15 28 felony if committed by an adult, the court, its designee,
 15 29 or law enforcement officials may release such a complaint,
 15 30 including the identity of the child.
 15 31    The bill provides that an intake or juvenile court officer
 15 32 shall disclose to the alleged victim of a delinquent act, upon
 15 33 request, the complaint, the name and address of the child who
 15 34 allegedly committed the delinquent act, and the disposition
 15 35 of the complaint. If the alleged delinquent act would be
 16  1 a forcible felony if committed by an adult, the intake or
 16  2 juvenile court officer shall provide notification to the victim
 16  3 as required by Code section 915.24.
 16  4    SEALING OF JUVENILE COURT RECORDS UNAVAILABLE FOR
 16  5 OPERATING=WHILE=INTOXICATED VIOLATIONS.  Under current Code
 16  6 section 232.150, a court shall order juvenile court records
 16  7 to be sealed if the person who is the subject of the juvenile
 16  8 court records is 18 years of age or older and 2 years have
 16  9 elapsed since the last official action in the person's case,
 16 10 the person has not been subsequently convicted of a felony
 16 11 or an aggravated or serious misdemeanor or adjudicated a
 16 12 delinquent child for an act which if committed by an adult
 16 13 would be a felony, an aggravated misdemeanor, or a serious
 16 14 misdemeanor and no proceeding is pending seeking such
 16 15 conviction or adjudication, and the person was not placed on
 16 16 youthful offender status, transferred back to district court
 16 17 after the youthful offender's 18th birthday, and sentenced for
 16 18 the offense which precipitated the youthful offender placement.
 16 19 The bill in newly designated Code section 232.150(4) provides
 16 20 that the court shall not seal a person's juvenile court records
 16 21 if the person was adjudicated delinquent for violating Code
 16 22 section 321J.2, which prohibits the operation of a motor
 16 23 vehicle while under the influence of alcohol or a drug.
 16 24    RELEASE OF CONFIDENTIAL RECORDS.  The bill provides that a
 16 25 public record which is confidential under the provisions of
 16 26 Code chapter 232 shall only be subject to release upon order of
 16 27 a court in a proceeding under Code chapter 232.
 16 28    EXISTING CONFIDENTIALITY EXEMPTIONS.  The bill retains
 16 29 certain existing exemptions to confidentiality of juvenile
 16 30 court records. Pursuant to Code section 692A.121(8), records
 16 31 concerning sex offense convictions which are committed by
 16 32 minors may be released in the same manner as records of
 16 33 convictions of adults. Pursuant to Code section 915.10A,
 16 34 information concerning a juvenile charged with a felony offense
 16 35 may be released pursuant to an automated victim notification
 17  1 system. Under the bill, these exemptions to confidentiality
 17  2 are not amended and therefore still apply to juvenile court
 17  3 records.
 17  4    RIGHT TO COUNSEL.  The bill in Code section 232.11 provides
 17  5 that a child has the right to be represented by counsel at a
 17  6 hearing on a confidentiality order under Code section 232.149A
 17  7 or a public records order under Code section 232.149B.
 17  8    APPLICABILITY.  The bill applies to juvenile delinquency
 17  9 proceedings which are pending or arise on or after July 1,
 17 10 2016.

 12 15 an individual pursuant to federal law; the statistical analysis
 12 16 center for the purposes stated in Code section 216A.136; a
 12 17 state or local law enforcement agency; and the alleged victim
 12 18 of any delinquent act in the proceeding.
 12 19    The bill in newly designated Code section 232.147(3A)
 12 20 provides that juvenile court records containing a petition or
 12 21 complaint alleging the commission of a delinquent act that
 12 22 would be a forcible felony if committed by an adult shall be
 12 23 public records unless subject to a confidentiality order under
 12 24 Code section 232.149A or a sealing order under Code section
 12 25 232.150.  However, the bill provides that such official records
 12 26 shall not be available to the public or any governmental
 12 27 agency through the internet or in an electronic customized
 12 28 data report unless the child has been adjudicated delinquent
 12 29 in the matter.  Nevertheless, the bill provides that official
 12 30 juvenile court records may be disclosed without a court order
 12 31 through the internet or in an electronic customized data
 12 32 report prior to the child being adjudicated delinquent to the
 12 33 judge and professional court staff, including juvenile court
 12 34 officers; the child's counsel or guardian ad litem; the county
 12 35 attorney and the county attorney's assistants; a court, court
 13  1 professional staff, and adult probation officers in connection
 13  2 with the preparation of a presentence report concerning a
 13  3 person who prior thereto had been the subject of a juvenile
 13  4 court proceeding; a state or local law enforcement agency; the
 13  5 state public defender; the statistical analysis center for
 13  6 the purposes stated in Code section 216A.136; the department
 13  7 of human services; the department of corrections; a judicial
 13  8 district department of correctional services; and the board of
 13  9 parole.
 13 10    CONFIDENTIALITY OF TRANSCRIPTS.  The bill in newly
 13 11 designated Code section 232.147(3B) provides that if the court
 13 12 has excluded the public from a hearing pursuant to Code section
 13 13 232.39 or 232.92, the transcript of the proceedings shall not
 13 14 be deemed a public record and inspection and disclosure of
 13 15 the contents of the transcript shall not be permitted except
 13 16 pursuant to a court order or unless otherwise provided in Code
 13 17 chapter 232.
 13 18    USE OF ADJUDICATION OF DELINQUENCY FOR PENALTY ENHANCEMENTS
 13 19 OR EVIDENCE.  The bill in newly designated Code section
 13 20 232.147(13) provides that the confidentiality of a final
 13 21 adjudication of delinquency under Code section 232.147 or
 13 22 pursuant to Code section 232.149A shall not prohibit the state
 13 23 from pleading or proving the adjudication at a subsequent
 13 24 criminal or delinquency proceeding for the purpose of penalty
 13 25 enhancement when a provision of the Code specifically deems the
 13 26 delinquency adjudication to constitute a final conviction.
 13 27    The bill in newly designated Code section 232.147(14)
 13 28 provides that the provisions of the bill shall not be construed
 13 29 to limit or restrict the production, use, or introduction
 13 30 of official juvenile court records in any juvenile or adult
 13 31 criminal proceeding, where such records are relevant and deemed
 13 32 admissible under any other provision of the law.
 13 33    CONFIDENTIALITY OF RECORDS AND FILES OF CRIMINAL OR
 13 34 JUVENILE JUSTICE AGENCIES.  Under current law, records and
 13 35 files of a criminal or juvenile justice agency concerning
 14  1 a child involved in a delinquent act are public records,
 14  2 subject to certain exceptions. The bill in Code section
 14  3 232.149 provides that the records and files of a criminal or
 14  4 juvenile justice agency, an intake officer, or a juvenile court
 14  5 officer concerning a child involved in a delinquent act are
 14  6 confidential. The bill further provides that the records of an
 14  7 intake officer or juvenile court officer containing a dismissal
 14  8 of a complaint or an informal adjustment of a complaint when
 14  9 no petition is filed relating to the complaint, shall not be
 14 10 available to the public, but may be disclosed to the judge and
 14 11 professional court staff, including juvenile court officers;
 14 12 the child's counsel or guardian ad litem; the county attorney
 14 13 and county attorney's assistants;  the superintendent or the
 14 14 superintendent's designee of the school district for the
 14 15 school attended by the child or the authorities in charge of
 14 16 an accredited nonpublic school attended by the child; a member
 14 17 of the armed forces of the United States who is conducting a
 14 18 background investigation of an individual pursuant to federal
 14 19 law; the statistical analysis center for the purposes stated
 14 20 in Code section 216A.136; the state public defender;  the
 14 21 department of human services; and the alleged victim of the
 14 22 delinquent act.
 14 23    PUBLIC RECORDS HEARINGS.  The bill enacts new Code section
 14 24 232.149B, which provides that a person may apply for a court
 14 25 order to make confidential juvenile court records public.
 14 26 The bill provides that a rebuttable presumption exists that
 14 27 official juvenile court records shall remain confidential. The
 14 28 bill provides that the court shall order the official juvenile
 14 29 court records in such a delinquency proceeding to be public
 14 30 records if either the public's interest in making the records
 14 31 public outweighs the juvenile's interest in maintaining the
 14 32 confidentiality of the records or the juvenile has been placed
 14 33 on youthful offender status pursuant to Code section 232.45(7)
 14 34 and Code section 907.3A(1), and will be transferred back to
 14 35 the district court for sentencing prior to the child's 18th
 15  1 birthday. The court may order the official juvenile court
 15  2 records in such a delinquency proceeding to be public records
 15  3 if the juvenile has been subsequently adjudicated delinquent
 15  4 for a public offense that would be a serious misdemeanor,
 15  5 aggravated misdemeanor, or felony offense if committed by an
 15  6 adult, or another delinquency proceeding is pending seeking
 15  7 such an adjudication. The bill provides that records subject
 15  8 to a public records order may be sealed at a later date
 15  9 pursuant to Code section 232.150.
 15 10    RIGHT TO REVIEW AND RELEASE A CONFIDENTIAL COMPLAINT.  The
 15 11 bill provides that delinquency complaints shall be released
 15 12 in accordance with Code section 915.25. Under current Code
 15 13 section 915.25, a complaint which alleges that a child who is
 15 14 at least 10 years of age committed a delinquent act, which if
 15 15 committed by an adult would be a public offense, is a public
 15 16 record. Current Code section 915.25 authorizes the court,
 15 17 its designee, or law enforcement officials to release such
 15 18 a complaint, including the identity of the child. The bill
 15 19 amends Code section 915.25 to provide that such a complaint
 15 20 is confidential unless the complaint alleges that the child
 15 21 committed a delinquent act that if committed by an adult would
 15 22 be a forcible felony. However, the bill authorizes state and
 15 23 local enforcement officials to release a confidential complaint
 15 24 against a child if the child is at large and doing so is deemed
 15 25 necessary for the protection of the public or the safety of
 15 26 the child. If the complaint is not confidential because the
 15 27 alleged delinquent act is an act that would be a forcible
 15 28 felony if committed by an adult, the court, its designee,
 15 29 or law enforcement officials may release such a complaint,
 15 30 including the identity of the child.
 15 31    The bill provides that an intake or juvenile court officer
 15 32 shall disclose to the alleged victim of a delinquent act, upon
 15 33 request, the complaint, the name and address of the child who
 15 34 allegedly committed the delinquent act, and the disposition
 15 35 of the complaint. If the alleged delinquent act would be
 16  1 a forcible felony if committed by an adult, the intake or
 16  2 juvenile court officer shall provide notification to the victim
 16  3 as required by Code section 915.24.
 16  4    SEALING OF JUVENILE COURT RECORDS UNAVAILABLE FOR
 16  5 OPERATING=WHILE=INTOXICATED VIOLATIONS.  Under current Code
 16  6 section 232.150, a court shall order juvenile court records
 16  7 to be sealed if the person who is the subject of the juvenile
 16  8 court records is 18 years of age or older and 2 years have
 16  9 elapsed since the last official action in the person's case,
 16 10 the person has not been subsequently convicted of a felony
 16 11 or an aggravated or serious misdemeanor or adjudicated a
 16 12 delinquent child for an act which if committed by an adult
 16 13 would be a felony, an aggravated misdemeanor, or a serious
 16 14 misdemeanor and no proceeding is pending seeking such
 16 15 conviction or adjudication, and the person was not placed on
 16 16 youthful offender status, transferred back to district court
 16 17 after the youthful offender's 18th birthday, and sentenced for
 16 18 the offense which precipitated the youthful offender placement.
 16 19 The bill in newly designated Code section 232.150(4) provides
 16 20 that the court shall not seal a person's juvenile court records
 16 21 if the person was adjudicated delinquent for violating Code
 16 22 section 321J.2, which prohibits the operation of a motor
 16 23 vehicle while under the influence of alcohol or a drug.
 16 24    RELEASE OF CONFIDENTIAL RECORDS.  The bill provides that a
 16 25 public record which is confidential under the provisions of
 16 26 Code chapter 232 shall only be subject to release upon order of
 16 27 a court in a proceeding under Code chapter 232.
 16 28    EXISTING CONFIDENTIALITY EXEMPTIONS.  The bill retains
 16 29 certain existing exemptions to confidentiality of juvenile
 16 30 court records. Pursuant to Code section 692A.121(8), records
 16 31 concerning sex offense convictions which are committed by
 16 32 minors may be released in the same manner as records of
 16 33 convictions of adults. Pursuant to Code section 915.10A,
 16 34 information concerning a juvenile charged with a felony offense
 16 35 may be released pursuant to an automated victim notification
 17  1 system. Under the bill, these exemptions to confidentiality
 17  2 are not amended and therefore still apply to juvenile court
 17  3 records.
 17  4    RIGHT TO COUNSEL.  The bill in Code section 232.11 provides
 17  5 that a child has the right to be represented by counsel at a
 17  6 hearing on a confidentiality order under Code section 232.149A
 17  7 or a public records order under Code section 232.149B.
 17  8    APPLICABILITY.  The bill applies to juvenile delinquency

 12 18 of any delinquent act in the proceeding.
 12 19    The bill in newly designated Code section 232.147(3A)
 12 20 provides that juvenile court records containing a petition or
 12 21 complaint alleging the commission of a delinquent act that
 12 22 would be a forcible felony if committed by an adult shall be
 12 23 public records unless subject to a confidentiality order under
 12 24 Code section 232.149A or a sealing order under Code section
 12 25 232.150.  However, the bill provides that such official records
 12 26 shall not be available to the public or any governmental
 12 27 agency through the internet or in an electronic customized
 12 28 data report unless the child has been adjudicated delinquent
 12 29 in the matter.  Nevertheless, the bill provides that official
 12 30 juvenile court records may be disclosed without a court order

 12 33 judge and professional court staff, including juvenile court
 12 34 officers; the child's counsel or guardian ad litem; the county
 12 35 attorney and the county attorney's assistants; a court, court
 13  1 professional staff, and adult probation officers in connection
 13  2 with the preparation of a presentence report concerning a
 13  3 person who prior thereto had been the subject of a juvenile
 13  4 court proceeding; a state or local law enforcement agency; the

 13  7 of human services; the department of corrections; a judicial
 13  8 district department of correctional services; and the board of
 13  9 parole.
 13 10    CONFIDENTIALITY OF TRANSCRIPTS.  The bill in newly
 13 11 designated Code section 232.147(3B) provides that if the court
 13 12 has excluded the public from a hearing pursuant to Code section
 13 13 232.39 or 232.92, the transcript of the proceedings shall not
 13 14 be deemed a public record and inspection and disclosure of
 13 15 the contents of the transcript shall not be permitted except
 13 16 pursuant to a court order or unless otherwise provided in Code
 13 17 chapter 232.
 13 18    USE OF ADJUDICATION OF DELINQUENCY FOR PENALTY ENHANCEMENTS
 13 19 OR EVIDENCE.  The bill in newly designated Code section
 13 20 232.147(13) provides that the confidentiality of a final
 13 21 adjudication of delinquency under Code section 232.147 or
 13 22 pursuant to Code section 232.149A shall not prohibit the state
 13 23 from pleading or proving the adjudication at a subsequent
 13 24 criminal or delinquency proceeding for the purpose of penalty
 13 25 enhancement when a provision of the Code specifically deems the
 13 26 delinquency adjudication to constitute a final conviction.
 13 27    The bill in newly designated Code section 232.147(14)
 13 28 provides that the provisions of the bill shall not be construed
 13 29 to limit or restrict the production, use, or introduction
 13 30 of official juvenile court records in any juvenile or adult
 13 31 criminal proceeding, where such records are relevant and deemed
 13 32 admissible under any other provision of the law.
 13 33    CONFIDENTIALITY OF RECORDS AND FILES OF CRIMINAL OR
 13 34 JUVENILE JUSTICE AGENCIES.  Under current law, records and
 13 35 files of a criminal or juvenile justice agency concerning
 14  1 a child involved in a delinquent act are public records,
 14  2 subject to certain exceptions. The bill in Code section
 14  3 232.149 provides that the records and files of a criminal or
 14  4 juvenile justice agency, an intake officer, or a juvenile court
 14  5 officer concerning a child involved in a delinquent act are
 14  6 confidential. The bill further provides that the records of an
 14  7 intake officer or juvenile court officer containing a dismissal
 14  8 of a complaint or an informal adjustment of a complaint when
 14  9 no petition is filed relating to the complaint, shall not be
 14 10 available to the public, but may be disclosed to the judge and
 14 11 professional court staff, including juvenile court officers;
 14 12 the child's counsel or guardian ad litem; the county attorney
 14 13 and county attorney's assistants;  the superintendent or the

 14 19 law; the statistical analysis center for the purposes stated
 14 20 in Code section 216A.136; the state public defender;  the
 14 21 department of human services; and the alleged victim of the
 14 22 delinquent act.
 14 23    PUBLIC RECORDS HEARINGS.  The bill enacts new Code section
 14 24 232.149B, which provides that a person may apply for a court
 14 25 order to make confidential juvenile court records public.
 14 26 The bill provides that a rebuttable presumption exists that
 14 27 official juvenile court records shall remain confidential. The
 14 28 bill provides that the court shall order the official juvenile
 14 29 court records in such a delinquency proceeding to be public
 14 30 records if either the public's interest in making the records
 14 31 public outweighs the juvenile's interest in maintaining the
 14 32 confidentiality of the records or the juvenile has been placed
 14 33 on youthful offender status pursuant to Code section 232.45(7)
 14 34 and Code section 907.3A(1), and will be transferred back to
 14 35 the district court for sentencing prior to the child's 18th
 15  1 birthday. The court may order the official juvenile court
 15  2 records in such a delinquency proceeding to be public records
 15  3 if the juvenile has been subsequently adjudicated delinquent
 15  4 for a public offense that would be a serious misdemeanor,
 15  5 aggravated misdemeanor, or felony offense if committed by an
 15  6 adult, or another delinquency proceeding is pending seeking
 15  7 such an adjudication. The bill provides that records subject
 15  8 to a public records order may be sealed at a later date
 15  9 pursuant to Code section 232.150.
 15 10    RIGHT TO REVIEW AND RELEASE A CONFIDENTIAL COMPLAINT.  The
 15 11 bill provides that delinquency complaints shall be released
 15 12 in accordance with Code section 915.25. Under current Code
 15 13 section 915.25, a complaint which alleges that a child who is
 15 14 at least 10 years of age committed a delinquent act, which if
 15 15 committed by an adult would be a public offense, is a public
 15 16 record. Current Code section 915.25 authorizes the court,
 15 17 its designee, or law enforcement officials to release such
 15 18 a complaint, including the identity of the child. The bill
 15 19 amends Code section 915.25 to provide that such a complaint
 15 20 is confidential unless the complaint alleges that the child
 15 21 committed a delinquent act that if committed by an adult would
 15 22 be a forcible felony. However, the bill authorizes state and
 15 23 local enforcement officials to release a confidential complaint
 15 24 against a child if the child is at large and doing so is deemed
 15 25 necessary for the protection of the public or the safety of
 15 26 the child. If the complaint is not confidential because the
 15 27 alleged delinquent act is an act that would be a forcible
 15 28 felony if committed by an adult, the court, its designee,
 15 29 or law enforcement officials may release such a complaint,
 15 30 including the identity of the child.
 15 31    The bill provides that an intake or juvenile court officer
 15 32 shall disclose to the alleged victim of a delinquent act, upon
 15 33 request, the complaint, the name and address of the child who
 15 34 allegedly committed the delinquent act, and the disposition
 15 35 of the complaint. If the alleged delinquent act would be
 16  1 a forcible felony if committed by an adult, the intake or
 16  2 juvenile court officer shall provide notification to the victim
 16  3 as required by Code section 915.24.
 16  4    SEALING OF JUVENILE COURT RECORDS UNAVAILABLE FOR
 16  5 OPERATING=WHILE=INTOXICATED VIOLATIONS.  Under current Code
 16  6 section 232.150, a court shall order juvenile court records
 16  7 to be sealed if the person who is the subject of the juvenile
 16  8 court records is 18 years of age or older and 2 years have
 16  9 elapsed since the last official action in the person's case,
 16 10 the person has not been subsequently convicted of a felony
 16 11 or an aggravated or serious misdemeanor or adjudicated a
 16 12 delinquent child for an act which if committed by an adult
 16 13 would be a felony, an aggravated misdemeanor, or a serious
 16 14 misdemeanor and no proceeding is pending seeking such
 16 15 conviction or adjudication, and the person was not placed on
 16 16 youthful offender status, transferred back to district court
 16 17 after the youthful offender's 18th birthday, and sentenced for
 16 18 the offense which precipitated the youthful offender placement.
 16 19 The bill in newly designated Code section 232.150(4) provides
 16 20 that the court shall not seal a person's juvenile court records
 16 21 if the person was adjudicated delinquent for violating Code
 16 22 section 321J.2, which prohibits the operation of a motor
 16 23 vehicle while under the influence of alcohol or a drug.
 16 24    RELEASE OF CONFIDENTIAL RECORDS.  The bill provides that a
 16 25 public record which is confidential under the provisions of
 16 26 Code chapter 232 shall only be subject to release upon order of
 16 27 a court in a proceeding under Code chapter 232.
 16 28    EXISTING CONFIDENTIALITY EXEMPTIONS.  The bill retains
 16 29 certain existing exemptions to confidentiality of juvenile
 16 30 court records. Pursuant to Code section 692A.121(8), records
 16 31 concerning sex offense convictions which are committed by
 16 32 minors may be released in the same manner as records of
 16 33 convictions of adults. Pursuant to Code section 915.10A,
 16 34 information concerning a juvenile charged with a felony offense
 16 35 may be released pursuant to an automated victim notification
 17  1 system. Under the bill, these exemptions to confidentiality
 17  2 are not amended and therefore still apply to juvenile court
 17  3 records.
 17  4    RIGHT TO COUNSEL.  The bill in Code section 232.11 provides
 17  5 that a child has the right to be represented by counsel at a
 17  6 hearing on a confidentiality order under Code section 232.149A
 17  7 or a public records order under Code section 232.149B.
 17  8    APPLICABILITY.  The bill applies to juvenile delinquency
 17  9 proceedings which are pending or arise on or after July 1,
 17 10 2016.

 12 17 state or local law enforcement agency; and the alleged victim
 12 18 of any delinquent act in the proceeding.
 12 19    The bill in newly designated Code section 232.147(3A)
 12 20 provides that juvenile court records containing a petition or
 12 21 complaint alleging the commission of a delinquent act that
 12 22 would be a forcible felony if committed by an adult shall be
 12 23 public records unless subject to a confidentiality order under
 12 24 Code section 232.149A or a sealing order under Code section
 12 25 232.150.  However, the bill provides that such official records
 12 26 shall not be available to the public or any governmental
 12 27 agency through the internet or in an electronic customized
 12 28 data report unless the child has been adjudicated delinquent
 12 29 in the matter.  Nevertheless, the bill provides that official
 12 30 juvenile court records may be disclosed without a court order
 12 31 through the internet or in an electronic customized data
 12 32 report prior to the child being adjudicated delinquent to the
 12 33 judge and professional court staff, including juvenile court
 12 34 officers; the child's counsel or guardian ad litem; the county
 12 35 attorney and the county attorney's assistants; a court, court
 13  1 professional staff, and adult probation officers in connection
 13  2 with the preparation of a presentence report concerning a
 13  3 person who prior thereto had been the subject of a juvenile
 13  4 court proceeding; a state or local law enforcement agency; the
 13  5 state public defender; the statistical analysis center for
 13  6 the purposes stated in Code section 216A.136; the department
 13  7 of human services; the department of corrections; a judicial
 13  8 district department of correctional services; and the board of
 13  9 parole.
 13 10    CONFIDENTIALITY OF TRANSCRIPTS.  The bill in newly
 13 11 designated Code section 232.147(3B) provides that if the court
 13 12 has excluded the public from a hearing pursuant to Code section
 13 13 232.39 or 232.92, the transcript of the proceedings shall not
 13 14 be deemed a public record and inspection and disclosure of
 13 15 the contents of the transcript shall not be permitted except
 13 16 pursuant to a court order or unless otherwise provided in Code
 13 17 chapter 232.
 13 18    USE OF ADJUDICATION OF DELINQUENCY FOR PENALTY ENHANCEMENTS
 13 19 OR EVIDENCE.  The bill in newly designated Code section
 13 20 232.147(13) provides that the confidentiality of a final
 13 21 adjudication of delinquency under Code section 232.147 or
 13 22 pursuant to Code section 232.149A shall not prohibit the state
 13 23 from pleading or proving the adjudication at a subsequent
 13 24 criminal or delinquency proceeding for the purpose of penalty
 13 25 enhancement when a provision of the Code specifically deems the
 13 26 delinquency adjudication to constitute a final conviction.
 13 27    The bill in newly designated Code section 232.147(14)
 13 28 provides that the provisions of the bill shall not be construed
 13 29 to limit or restrict the production, use, or introduction
 13 30 of official juvenile court records in any juvenile or adult
 13 31 criminal proceeding, where such records are relevant and deemed
 13 32 admissible under any other provision of the law.
 13 33    CONFIDENTIALITY OF RECORDS AND FILES OF CRIMINAL OR
 13 34 JUVENILE JUSTICE AGENCIES.  Under current law, records and
 13 35 files of a criminal or juvenile justice agency concerning
 14  1 a child involved in a delinquent act are public records,
 14  2 subject to certain exceptions. The bill in Code section
 14  3 232.149 provides that the records and files of a criminal or
 14  4 juvenile justice agency, an intake officer, or a juvenile court
 14  5 officer concerning a child involved in a delinquent act are
 14  6 confidential. The bill further provides that the records of an
 14  7 intake officer or juvenile court officer containing a dismissal
 14  8 of a complaint or an informal adjustment of a complaint when
 14  9 no petition is filed relating to the complaint, shall not be
 14 10 available to the public, but may be disclosed to the judge and
 14 11 professional court staff, including juvenile court officers;
 14 12 the child's counsel or guardian ad litem; the county attorney
 14 13 and county attorney's assistants;  the superintendent or the
 14 14 superintendent's designee of the school district for the
 14 15 school attended by the child or the authorities in charge of
 14 16 an accredited nonpublic school attended by the child; a member
 14 17 of the armed forces of the United States who is conducting a
 14 18 background investigation of an individual pursuant to federal
 14 19 law; the statistical analysis center for the purposes stated
 14 20 in Code section 216A.136; the state public defender;  the
 14 21 department of human services; and the alleged victim of the
 14 22 delinquent act.
 14 23    PUBLIC RECORDS HEARINGS.  The bill enacts new Code section
 14 24 232.149B, which provides that a person may apply for a court
 14 25 order to make confidential juvenile court records public.
 14 26 The bill provides that a rebuttable presumption exists that
 14 27 official juvenile court records shall remain confidential. The
 14 28 bill provides that the court shall order the official juvenile
 14 29 court records in such a delinquency proceeding to be public
 14 30 records if either the public's interest in making the records
 14 31 public outweighs the juvenile's interest in maintaining the
 14 32 confidentiality of the records or the juvenile has been placed
 14 33 on youthful offender status pursuant to Code section 232.45(7)
 14 34 and Code section 907.3A(1), and will be transferred back to
 14 35 the district court for sentencing prior to the child's 18th
 15  1 birthday. The court may order the official juvenile court
 15  2 records in such a delinquency proceeding to be public records
 15  3 if the juvenile has been subsequently adjudicated delinquent
 15  4 for a public offense that would be a serious misdemeanor,
 15  5 aggravated misdemeanor, or felony offense if committed by an
 15  6 adult, or another delinquency proceeding is pending seeking
 15  7 such an adjudication. The bill provides that records subject
 15  8 to a public records order may be sealed at a later date
 15  9 pursuant to Code section 232.150.
 15 10    RIGHT TO REVIEW AND RELEASE A CONFIDENTIAL COMPLAINT.  The
 15 11 bill provides that delinquency complaints shall be released
 15 12 in accordance with Code section 915.25. Under current Code
 15 13 section 915.25, a complaint which alleges that a child who is
 15 14 at least 10 years of age committed a delinquent act, which if
 15 15 committed by an adult would be a public offense, is a public
 15 16 record. Current Code section 915.25 authorizes the court,
 15 17 its designee, or law enforcement officials to release such
 15 18 a complaint, including the identity of the child. The bill
 15 19 amends Code section 915.25 to provide that such a complaint
 15 20 is confidential unless the complaint alleges that the child
 15 21 committed a delinquent act that if committed by an adult would
 15 22 be a forcible felony. However, the bill authorizes state and
 15 23 local enforcement officials to release a confidential complaint
 15 24 against a child if the child is at large and doing so is deemed
 15 25 necessary for the protection of the public or the safety of
 15 26 the child. If the complaint is not confidential because the
 15 27 alleged delinquent act is an act that would be a forcible
 15 28 felony if committed by an adult, the court, its designee,
 15 29 or law enforcement officials may release such a complaint,
 15 30 including the identity of the child.
 15 31    The bill provides that an intake or juvenile court officer
 15 32 shall disclose to the alleged victim of a delinquent act, upon
 15 33 request, the complaint, the name and address of the child who
 15 34 allegedly committed the delinquent act, and the disposition
 15 35 of the complaint. If the alleged delinquent act would be
 16  1 a forcible felony if committed by an adult, the intake or
 16  2 juvenile court officer shall provide notification to the victim
 16  3 as required by Code section 915.24.
 16  4    SEALING OF JUVENILE COURT RECORDS UNAVAILABLE FOR
 16  5 OPERATING=WHILE=INTOXICATED VIOLATIONS.  Under current Code
 16  6 section 232.150, a court shall order juvenile court records
 16  7 to be sealed if the person who is the subject of the juvenile
 16  8 court records is 18 years of age or older and 2 years have
 16  9 elapsed since the last official action in the person's case,
 16 10 the person has not been subsequently convicted of a felony
 16 11 or an aggravated or serious misdemeanor or adjudicated a
 16 12 delinquent child for an act which if committed by an adult
 16 13 would be a felony, an aggravated misdemeanor, or a serious
 16 14 misdemeanor and no proceeding is pending seeking such
 16 15 conviction or adjudication, and the person was not placed on
 16 16 youthful offender status, transferred back to district court
 16 17 after the youthful offender's 18th birthday, and sentenced for
 16 18 the offense which precipitated the youthful offender placement.
 16 19 The bill in newly designated Code section 232.150(4) provides
 16 20 that the court shall not seal a person's juvenile court records
 16 21 if the person was adjudicated delinquent for violating Code
 16 22 section 321J.2, which prohibits the operation of a motor
 16 23 vehicle while under the influence of alcohol or a drug.
 16 24    RELEASE OF CONFIDENTIAL RECORDS.  The bill provides that a
 16 25 public record which is confidential under the provisions of
 16 26 Code chapter 232 shall only be subject to release upon order of
 16 27 a court in a proceeding under Code chapter 232.
 16 28    EXISTING CONFIDENTIALITY EXEMPTIONS.  The bill retains
 16 29 certain existing exemptions to confidentiality of juvenile
 16 30 court records. Pursuant to Code section 692A.121(8), records
 16 31 concerning sex offense convictions which are committed by
 16 32 minors may be released in the same manner as records of
 16 33 convictions of adults. Pursuant to Code section 915.10A,
 16 34 information concerning a juvenile charged with a felony offense
 16 35 may be released pursuant to an automated victim notification
 17  1 system. Under the bill, these exemptions to confidentiality
 17  2 are not amended and therefore still apply to juvenile court
 17  3 records.
 17  4    RIGHT TO COUNSEL.  The bill in Code section 232.11 provides
 17  5 that a child has the right to be represented by counsel at a
 17  6 hearing on a confidentiality order under Code section 232.149A
 17  7 or a public records order under Code section 232.149B.
 17  8    APPLICABILITY.  The bill applies to juvenile delinquency
 17  9 proceedings which are pending or arise on or after July 1,
 17 10 2016.

 12 18 of any delinquent act in the proceeding.
 12 19    The bill in newly designated Code section 232.147(3A)
 12 20 provides that juvenile court records containing a petition or
 12 21 complaint alleging the commission of a delinquent act that
 12 22 would be a forcible felony if committed by an adult shall be
 12 23 public records unless subject to a confidentiality order under
 12 24 Code section 232.149A or a sealing order under Code section
 12 25 232.150.  However, the bill provides that such official records
 12 26 shall not be available to the public or any governmental
 12 27 agency through the internet or in an electronic customized
 12 28 data report unless the child has been adjudicated delinquent
 12 29 in the matter.  Nevertheless, the bill provides that official
 12 30 juvenile court records may be disclosed without a court order
 12 31 through the internet or in an electronic customized data
 12 32 report prior to the child being adjudicated delinquent to the
 12 33 judge and professional court staff, including juvenile court
 12 34 officers; the child's counsel or guardian ad litem; the county
 12 35 attorney and the county attorney's assistants; a court, court
 13  1 professional staff, and adult probation officers in connection
 13  2 with the preparation of a presentence report concerning a
 13  3 person who prior thereto had been the subject of a juvenile
 13  4 court proceeding; a state or local law enforcement agency; the
 13  5 state public defender; the statistical analysis center for
 13  6 the purposes stated in Code section 216A.136; the department
 13  7 of human services; the department of corrections; a judicial
 13  8 district department of correctional services; and the board of
 13  9 parole.
 13 10    CONFIDENTIALITY OF TRANSCRIPTS.  The bill in newly
 13 11 designated Code section 232.147(3B) provides that if the court
 13 12 has excluded the public from a hearing pursuant to Code section
 13 13 232.39 or 232.92, the transcript of the proceedings shall not
 13 14 be deemed a public record and inspection and disclosure of
 13 15 the contents of the transcript shall not be permitted except
 13 16 pursuant to a court order or unless otherwise provided in Code
 13 17 chapter 232.
 13 18    USE OF ADJUDICATION OF DELINQUENCY FOR PENALTY ENHANCEMENTS
 13 19 OR EVIDENCE.  The bill in newly designated Code section
 13 20 232.147(13) provides that the confidentiality of a final
 13 21 adjudication of delinquency under Code section 232.147 or
 13 22 pursuant to Code section 232.149A shall not prohibit the state
 13 23 from pleading or proving the adjudication at a subsequent
 13 24 criminal or delinquency proceeding for the purpose of penalty
 13 25 enhancement when a provision of the Code specifically deems the
 13 26 delinquency adjudication to constitute a final conviction.
 13 27    The bill in newly designated Code section 232.147(14)
 13 28 provides that the provisions of the bill shall not be construed
 13 29 to limit or restrict the production, use, or introduction
 13 30 of official juvenile court records in any juvenile or adult
 13 31 criminal proceeding, where such records are relevant and deemed
 13 32 admissible under any other provision of the law.
 13 33    CONFIDENTIALITY OF RECORDS AND FILES OF CRIMINAL OR
 13 34 JUVENILE JUSTICE AGENCIES.  Under current law, records and
 13 35 files of a criminal or juvenile justice agency concerning
 14  1 a child involved in a delinquent act are public records,
 14  2 subject to certain exceptions. The bill in Code section
 14  3 232.149 provides that the records and files of a criminal or
 14  4 juvenile justice agency, an intake officer, or a juvenile court
 14  5 officer concerning a child involved in a delinquent act are
 14  6 confidential. The bill further provides that the records of an
 14  7 intake officer or juvenile court officer containing a dismissal
 14  8 of a complaint or an informal adjustment of a complaint when
 14  9 no petition is filed relating to the complaint, shall not be
 14 10 available to the public, but may be disclosed to the judge and
 14 11 professional court staff, including juvenile court officers;
 14 12 the child's counsel or guardian ad litem; the county attorney
 14 13 and county attorney's assistants;  the superintendent or the
 14 14 superintendent's designee of the school district for the
 14 15 school attended by the child or the authorities in charge of
 14 16 an accredited nonpublic school attended by the child; a member
 14 17 of the armed forces of the United States who is conducting a
 14 18 background investigation of an individual pursuant to federal
 14 19 law; the statistical analysis center for the purposes stated
 14 20 in Code section 216A.136; the state public defender;  the
 14 21 department of human services; and the alleged victim of the
 14 22 delinquent act.
 14 23    PUBLIC RECORDS HEARINGS.  The bill enacts new Code section
 14 24 232.149B, which provides that a person may apply for a court
 14 25 order to make confidential juvenile court records public.
 14 26 The bill provides that a rebuttable presumption exists that
 14 27 official juvenile court records shall remain confidential. The
 14 28 bill provides that the court shall order the official juvenile
 14 29 court records in such a delinquency proceeding to be public
 14 30 records if either the public's interest in making the records
 14 31 public outweighs the juvenile's interest in maintaining the
 14 32 confidentiality of the records or the juvenile has been placed
 14 33 on youthful offender status pursuant to Code section 232.45(7)
 14 34 and Code section 907.3A(1), and will be transferred back to
 14 35 the district court for sentencing prior to the child's 18th
 15  1 birthday. The court may order the official juvenile court
 15  2 records in such a delinquency proceeding to be public records
 15  3 if the juvenile has been subsequently adjudicated delinquent
 15  4 for a public offense that would be a serious misdemeanor,
 15  5 aggravated misdemeanor, or felony offense if committed by an
 15  6 adult, or another delinquency proceeding is pending seeking
 15  7 such an adjudication. The bill provides that records subject
 15  8 to a public records order may be sealed at a later date
 15  9 pursuant to Code section 232.150.
 15 10    RIGHT TO REVIEW AND RELEASE A CONFIDENTIAL COMPLAINT.  The
 15 11 bill provides that delinquency complaints shall be released
 15 12 in accordance with Code section 915.25. Under current Code
 15 13 section 915.25, a complaint which alleges that a child who is
 15 14 at least 10 years of age committed a delinquent act, which if
 15 15 committed by an adult would be a public offense, is a public
 15 16 record. Current Code section 915.25 authorizes the court,
 15 17 its designee, or law enforcement officials to release such
 15 18 a complaint, including the identity of the child. The bill
 15 19 amends Code section 915.25 to provide that such a complaint
 15 20 is confidential unless the complaint alleges that the child
 15 21 committed a delinquent act that if committed by an adult would
 15 22 be a forcible felony. However, the bill authorizes state and
 15 23 local enforcement officials to release a confidential complaint
 15 24 against a child if the child is at large and doing so is deemed
 15 25 necessary for the protection of the public or the safety of
 15 26 the child. If the complaint is not confidential because the
 15 27 alleged delinquent act is an act that would be a forcible
 15 28 felony if committed by an adult, the court, its designee,
 15 29 or law enforcement officials may release such a complaint,
 15 30 including the identity of the child.
 15 31    The bill provides that an intake or juvenile court officer
 15 32 shall disclose to the alleged victim of a delinquent act, upon
 15 33 request, the complaint, the name and address of the child who
 15 34 allegedly committed the delinquent act, and the disposition
 15 35 of the complaint. If the alleged delinquent act would be
 16  1 a forcible felony if committed by an adult, the intake or
 16  2 juvenile court officer shall provide notification to the victim
 16  3 as required by Code section 915.24.
 16  4    SEALING OF JUVENILE COURT RECORDS UNAVAILABLE FOR
 16  5 OPERATING=WHILE=INTOXICATED VIOLATIONS.  Under current Code
 16  6 section 232.150, a court shall order juvenile court records
 16  7 to be sealed if the person who is the subject of the juvenile
 16  8 court records is 18 years of age or older and 2 years have
 16  9 elapsed since the last official action in the person's case,
 16 10 the person has not been subsequently convicted of a felony
 16 11 or an aggravated or serious misdemeanor or adjudicated a
 16 12 delinquent child for an act which if committed by an adult
 16 13 would be a felony, an aggravated misdemeanor, or a serious
 16 14 misdemeanor and no proceeding is pending seeking such
 16 15 conviction or adjudication, and the person was not placed on
 16 16 youthful offender status, transferred back to district court
 16 17 after the youthful offender's 18th birthday, and sentenced for
 16 18 the offense which precipitated the youthful offender placement.
 16 19 The bill in newly designated Code section 232.150(4) provides
 16 20 that the court shall not seal a person's juvenile court records
 16 21 if the person was adjudicated delinquent for violating Code
 16 22 section 321J.2, which prohibits the operation of a motor
 16 23 vehicle while under the influence of alcohol or a drug.
 16 24    RELEASE OF CONFIDENTIAL RECORDS.  The bill provides that a
 16 25 public record which is confidential under the provisions of
 16 26 Code chapter 232 shall only be subject to release upon order of
 16 27 a court in a proceeding under Code chapter 232.
 16 28    EXISTING CONFIDENTIALITY EXEMPTIONS.  The bill retains
 16 29 certain existing exemptions to confidentiality of juvenile
 16 30 court records. Pursuant to Code section 692A.121(8), records
 16 31 concerning sex offense convictions which are committed by
 16 32 minors may be released in the same manner as records of
 16 33 convictions of adults. Pursuant to Code section 915.10A,
 16 34 information concerning a juvenile charged with a felony offense
 16 35 may be released pursuant to an automated victim notification
 17  1 system. Under the bill, these exemptions to confidentiality
 17  2 are not amended and therefore still apply to juvenile court
 17  3 records.
 17  4    RIGHT TO COUNSEL.  The bill in Code section 232.11 provides
 17  5 that a child has the right to be represented by counsel at a
 17  6 hearing on a confidentiality order under Code section 232.149A
 17  7 or a public records order under Code section 232.149B.
 17  8    APPLICABILITY.  The bill applies to juvenile delinquency
 17  9 proceedings which are pending or arise on or after July 1,
 17 10 2016.

 12 16 center for the purposes stated in Code section 216A.136; a
 12 17 state or local law enforcement agency; and the alleged victim
 12 18 of any delinquent act in the proceeding.
 12 19    The bill in newly designated Code section 232.147(3A)
 12 20 provides that juvenile court records containing a petition or
 12 21 complaint alleging the commission of a delinquent act that
 12 22 would be a forcible felony if committed by an adult shall be
 12 23 public records unless subject to a confidentiality order under
 12 24 Code section 232.149A or a sealing order under Code section
 12 25 232.150.  However, the bill provides that such official records
 12 26 shall not be available to the public or any governmental
 12 27 agency through the internet or in an electronic customized
 12 28 data report unless the child has been adjudicated delinquent
 12 29 in the matter.  Nevertheless, the bill provides that official
 12 30 juvenile court records may be disclosed without a court order
 12 31 through the internet or in an electronic customized data
 12 32 report prior to the child being adjudicated delinquent to the
 12 33 judge and professional court staff, including juvenile court
 12 34 officers; the child's counsel or guardian ad litem; the county
 12 35 attorney and the county attorney's assistants; a court, court
 13  1 professional staff, and adult probation officers in connection
 13  2 with the preparation of a presentence report concerning a
 13  3 person who prior thereto had been the subject of a juvenile
 13  4 court proceeding; a state or local law enforcement agency; the
 13  5 state public defender; the statistical analysis center for
 13  6 the purposes stated in Code section 216A.136; the department
 13  7 of human services; the department of corrections; a judicial
 13  8 district department of correctional services; and the board of
 13  9 parole.
 13 10    CONFIDENTIALITY OF TRANSCRIPTS.  The bill in newly
 13 11 designated Code section 232.147(3B) provides that if the court
 13 12 has excluded the public from a hearing pursuant to Code section
 13 13 232.39 or 232.92, the transcript of the proceedings shall not
 13 14 be deemed a public record and inspection and disclosure of
 13 15 the contents of the transcript shall not be permitted except
 13 16 pursuant to a court order or unless otherwise provided in Code
 13 17 chapter 232.
 13 18    USE OF ADJUDICATION OF DELINQUENCY FOR PENALTY ENHANCEMENTS
 13 19 OR EVIDENCE.  The bill in newly designated Code section
 13 20 232.147(13) provides that the confidentiality of a final
 13 21 adjudication of delinquency under Code section 232.147 or
 13 22 pursuant to Code section 232.149A shall not prohibit the state
 13 23 from pleading or proving the adjudication at a subsequent
 13 24 criminal or delinquency proceeding for the purpose of penalty
 13 25 enhancement when a provision of the Code specifically deems the
 13 26 delinquency adjudication to constitute a final conviction.
 13 27    The bill in newly designated Code section 232.147(14)
 13 28 provides that the provisions of the bill shall not be construed
 13 29 to limit or restrict the production, use, or introduction
 13 30 of official juvenile court records in any juvenile or adult
 13 31 criminal proceeding, where such records are relevant and deemed
 13 32 admissible under any other provision of the law.
 13 33    CONFIDENTIALITY OF RECORDS AND FILES OF CRIMINAL OR
 13 34 JUVENILE JUSTICE AGENCIES.  Under current law, records and
 13 35 files of a criminal or juvenile justice agency concerning
 14  1 a child involved in a delinquent act are public records,
 14  2 subject to certain exceptions. The bill in Code section
 14  3 232.149 provides that the records and files of a criminal or
 14  4 juvenile justice agency, an intake officer, or a juvenile court
 14  5 officer concerning a child involved in a delinquent act are
 14  6 confidential. The bill further provides that the records of an
 14  7 intake officer or juvenile court officer containing a dismissal
 14  8 of a complaint or an informal adjustment of a complaint when
 14  9 no petition is filed relating to the complaint, shall not be
 14 10 available to the public, but may be disclosed to the judge and
 14 11 professional court staff, including juvenile court officers;
 14 12 the child's counsel or guardian ad litem; the county attorney
 14 13 and county attorney's assistants;  the superintendent or the
 14 14 superintendent's designee of the school district for the
 14 15 school attended by the child or the authorities in charge of
 14 16 an accredited nonpublic school attended by the child; a member
 14 17 of the armed forces of the United States who is conducting a
 14 18 background investigation of an individual pursuant to federal
 14 19 law; the statistical analysis center for the purposes stated
 14 20 in Code section 216A.136; the state public defender;  the
 14 21 department of human services; and the alleged victim of the
 14 22 delinquent act.
 14 23    PUBLIC RECORDS HEARINGS.  The bill enacts new Code section
 14 24 232.149B, which provides that a person may apply for a court
 14 25 order to make confidential juvenile court records public.
 14 26 The bill provides that a rebuttable presumption exists that
 14 27 official juvenile court records shall remain confidential. The
 14 28 bill provides that the court shall order the official juvenile
 14 29 court records in such a delinquency proceeding to be public
 14 30 records if either the public's interest in making the records
 14 31 public outweighs the juvenile's interest in maintaining the
 14 32 confidentiality of the records or the juvenile has been placed
 14 33 on youthful offender status pursuant to Code section 232.45(7)
 14 34 and Code section 907.3A(1), and will be transferred back to
 14 35 the district court for sentencing prior to the child's 18th
 15  1 birthday. The court may order the official juvenile court
 15  2 records in such a delinquency proceeding to be public records
 15  3 if the juvenile has been subsequently adjudicated delinquent
 15  4 for a public offense that would be a serious misdemeanor,
 15  5 aggravated misdemeanor, or felony offense if committed by an
 15  6 adult, or another delinquency proceeding is pending seeking
 15  7 such an adjudication. The bill provides that records subject
 15  8 to a public records order may be sealed at a later date
 15  9 pursuant to Code section 232.150.
 15 10    RIGHT TO REVIEW AND RELEASE A CONFIDENTIAL COMPLAINT.  The
 15 11 bill provides that delinquency complaints shall be released
 15 12 in accordance with Code section 915.25. Under current Code
 15 13 section 915.25, a complaint which alleges that a child who is
 15 14 at least 10 years of age committed a delinquent act, which if
 15 15 committed by an adult would be a public offense, is a public
 15 16 record. Current Code section 915.25 authorizes the court,
 15 17 its designee, or law enforcement officials to release such
 15 18 a complaint, including the identity of the child. The bill
 15 19 amends Code section 915.25 to provide that such a complaint
 15 20 is confidential unless the complaint alleges that the child
 15 21 committed a delinquent act that if committed by an adult would
 15 22 be a forcible felony. However, the bill authorizes state and
 15 23 local enforcement officials to release a confidential complaint
 15 24 against a child if the child is at large and doing so is deemed
 15 25 necessary for the protection of the public or the safety of
 15 26 the child. If the complaint is not confidential because the
 15 27 alleged delinquent act is an act that would be a forcible
 15 28 felony if committed by an adult, the court, its designee,
 15 29 or law enforcement officials may release such a complaint,
 15 30 including the identity of the child.
 15 31    The bill provides that an intake or juvenile court officer
 15 32 shall disclose to the alleged victim of a delinquent act, upon
 15 33 request, the complaint, the name and address of the child who
 15 34 allegedly committed the delinquent act, and the disposition
 15 35 of the complaint. If the alleged delinquent act would be
 16  1 a forcible felony if committed by an adult, the intake or
 16  2 juvenile court officer shall provide notification to the victim
 16  3 as required by Code section 915.24.
 16  4    SEALING OF JUVENILE COURT RECORDS UNAVAILABLE FOR
 16  5 OPERATING=WHILE=INTOXICATED VIOLATIONS.  Under current Code
 16  6 section 232.150, a court shall order juvenile court records
 16  7 to be sealed if the person who is the subject of the juvenile
 16  8 court records is 18 years of age or older and 2 years have
 16  9 elapsed since the last official action in the person's case,
 16 10 the person has not been subsequently convicted of a felony
 16 11 or an aggravated or serious misdemeanor or adjudicated a
 16 12 delinquent child for an act which if committed by an adult
 16 13 would be a felony, an aggravated misdemeanor, or a serious
 16 14 misdemeanor and no proceeding is pending seeking such
 16 15 conviction or adjudication, and the person was not placed on
 16 16 youthful offender status, transferred back to district court
 16 17 after the youthful offender's 18th birthday, and sentenced for
 16 18 the offense which precipitated the youthful offender placement.
 16 19 The bill in newly designated Code section 232.150(4) provides
 16 20 that the court shall not seal a person's juvenile court records
 16 21 if the person was adjudicated delinquent for violating Code
 16 22 section 321J.2, which prohibits the operation of a motor
 16 23 vehicle while under the influence of alcohol or a drug.
 16 24    RELEASE OF CONFIDENTIAL RECORDS.  The bill provides that a
 16 25 public record which is confidential under the provisions of
 16 26 Code chapter 232 shall only be subject to release upon order of
 16 27 a court in a proceeding under Code chapter 232.
 16 28    EXISTING CONFIDENTIALITY EXEMPTIONS.  The bill retains
 16 29 certain existing exemptions to confidentiality of juvenile
 16 30 court records. Pursuant to Code section 692A.121(8), records
 16 31 concerning sex offense convictions which are committed by
 16 32 minors may be released in the same manner as records of
 16 33 convictions of adults. Pursuant to Code section 915.10A,
 16 34 information concerning a juvenile charged with a felony offense
 16 35 may be released pursuant to an automated victim notification
 17  1 system. Under the bill, these exemptions to confidentiality
 17  2 are not amended and therefore still apply to juvenile court
 17  3 records.
 17  4    RIGHT TO COUNSEL.  The bill in Code section 232.11 provides
 17  5 that a child has the right to be represented by counsel at a
 17  6 hearing on a confidentiality order under Code section 232.149A
 17  7 or a public records order under Code section 232.149B.
 17  8    APPLICABILITY.  The bill applies to juvenile delinquency
 17  9 proceedings which are pending or arise on or after July 1,
 17 10 2016.

 12 17 state or local law enforcement agency; and the alleged victim
 12 18 of any delinquent act in the proceeding.
 12 19    The bill in newly designated Code section 232.147(3A)
 12 20 provides that juvenile court records containing a petition or
 12 21 complaint alleging the commission of a delinquent act that
 12 22 would be a forcible felony if committed by an adult shall be
 12 23 public records unless subject to a confidentiality order under
 12 24 Code section 232.149A or a sealing order under Code section
 12 25 232.150.  However, the bill provides that such official records
 12 26 shall not be available to the public or any governmental
 12 27 agency through the internet or in an electronic customized
 12 28 data report unless the child has been adjudicated delinquent
 12 29 in the matter.  Nevertheless, the bill provides that official
 12 30 juvenile court records may be disclosed without a court order
 12 31 through the internet or in an electronic customized data
 12 32 report prior to the child being adjudicated delinquent to the
 12 33 judge and professional court staff, including juvenile court
 12 34 officers; the child's counsel or guardian ad litem; the county
 12 35 attorney and the county attorney's assistants; a court, court
 13  1 professional staff, and adult probation officers in connection
 13  2 with the preparation of a presentence report concerning a
 13  3 person who prior thereto had been the subject of a juvenile
 13  4 court proceeding; a state or local law enforcement agency; the
 13  5 state public defender; the statistical analysis center for
 13  6 the purposes stated in Code section 216A.136; the department
 13  7 of human services; the department of corrections; a judicial
 13  8 district department of correctional services; and the board of
 13  9 parole.
 13 10    CONFIDENTIALITY OF TRANSCRIPTS.  The bill in newly
 13 11 designated Code section 232.147(3B) provides that if the court
 13 12 has excluded the public from a hearing pursuant to Code section
 13 13 232.39 or 232.92, the transcript of the proceedings shall not
 13 14 be deemed a public record and inspection and disclosure of
 13 15 the contents of the transcript shall not be permitted except
 13 16 pursuant to a court order or unless otherwise provided in Code
 13 17 chapter 232.
 13 18    USE OF ADJUDICATION OF DELINQUENCY FOR PENALTY ENHANCEMENTS
 13 19 OR EVIDENCE.  The bill in newly designated Code section
 13 20 232.147(13) provides that the confidentiality of a final
 13 21 adjudication of delinquency under Code section 232.147 or
 13 22 pursuant to Code section 232.149A shall not prohibit the state
 13 23 from pleading or proving the adjudication at a subsequent
 13 24 criminal or delinquency proceeding for the purpose of penalty
 13 25 enhancement when a provision of the Code specifically deems the
 13 26 delinquency adjudication to constitute a final conviction.
 13 27    The bill in newly designated Code section 232.147(14)
 13 28 provides that the provisions of the bill shall not be construed
 13 29 to limit or restrict the production, use, or introduction
 13 30 of official juvenile court records in any juvenile or adult
 13 31 criminal proceeding, where such records are relevant and deemed
 13 32 admissible under any other provision of the law.
 13 33    CONFIDENTIALITY OF RECORDS AND FILES OF CRIMINAL OR
 13 34 JUVENILE JUSTICE AGENCIES.  Under current law, records and
 13 35 files of a criminal or juvenile justice agency concerning
 14  1 a child involved in a delinquent act are public records,
 14  2 subject to certain exceptions. The bill in Code section
 14  3 232.149 provides that the records and files of a criminal or
 14  4 juvenile justice agency, an intake officer, or a juvenile court
 14  5 officer concerning a child involved in a delinquent act are
 14  6 confidential. The bill further provides that the records of an
 14  7 intake officer or juvenile court officer containing a dismissal
 14  8 of a complaint or an informal adjustment of a complaint when
 14  9 no petition is filed relating to the complaint, shall not be
 14 10 available to the public, but may be disclosed to the judge and
 14 11 professional court staff, including juvenile court officers;
 14 12 the child's counsel or guardian ad litem; the county attorney
 14 13 and county attorney's assistants;  the superintendent or the
 14 14 superintendent's designee of the school district for the
 14 15 school attended by the child or the authorities in charge of
 14 16 an accredited nonpublic school attended by the child; a member
 14 17 of the armed forces of the United States who is conducting a
 14 18 background investigation of an individual pursuant to federal
 14 19 law; the statistical analysis center for the purposes stated
 14 20 in Code section 216A.136; the state public defender;  the
 14 21 department of human services; and the alleged victim of the
 14 22 delinquent act.
 14 23    PUBLIC RECORDS HEARINGS.  The bill enacts new Code section
 14 24 232.149B, which provides that a person may apply for a court
 14 25 order to make confidential juvenile court records public.
 14 26 The bill provides that a rebuttable presumption exists that
 14 27 official juvenile court records shall remain confidential. The
 14 28 bill provides that the court shall order the official juvenile
 14 29 court records in such a delinquency proceeding to be public
 14 30 records if either the public's interest in making the records
 14 31 public outweighs the juvenile's interest in maintaining the
 14 32 confidentiality of the records or the juvenile has been placed
 14 33 on youthful offender status pursuant to Code section 232.45(7)
 14 34 and Code section 907.3A(1), and will be transferred back to
 14 35 the district court for sentencing prior to the child's 18th
 15  1 birthday. The court may order the official juvenile court
 15  2 records in such a delinquency proceeding to be public records
 15  3 if the juvenile has been subsequently adjudicated delinquent
 15  4 for a public offense that would be a serious misdemeanor,
 15  5 aggravated misdemeanor, or felony offense if committed by an
 15  6 adult, or another delinquency proceeding is pending seeking
 15  7 such an adjudication. The bill provides that records subject
 15  8 to a public records order may be sealed at a later date
 15  9 pursuant to Code section 232.150.
 15 10    RIGHT TO REVIEW AND RELEASE A CONFIDENTIAL COMPLAINT.  The
 15 11 bill provides that delinquency complaints shall be released
 15 12 in accordance with Code section 915.25. Under current Code
 15 13 section 915.25, a complaint which alleges that a child who is
 15 14 at least 10 years of age committed a delinquent act, which if
 15 15 committed by an adult would be a public offense, is a public
 15 16 record. Current Code section 915.25 authorizes the court,
 15 17 its designee, or law enforcement officials to release such
 15 18 a complaint, including the identity of the child. The bill
 15 19 amends Code section 915.25 to provide that such a complaint
 15 20 is confidential unless the complaint alleges that the child
 15 21 committed a delinquent act that if committed by an adult would
 15 22 be a forcible felony. However, the bill authorizes state and
 15 23 local enforcement officials to release a confidential complaint
 15 24 against a child if the child is at large and doing so is deemed
 15 25 necessary for the protection of the public or the safety of
 15 26 the child. If the complaint is not confidential because the
 15 27 alleged delinquent act is an act that would be a forcible
 15 28 felony if committed by an adult, the court, its designee,
 15 29 or law enforcement officials may release such a complaint,
 15 30 including the identity of the child.
 15 31    The bill provides that an intake or juvenile court officer
 15 32 shall disclose to the alleged victim of a delinquent act, upon
 15 33 request, the complaint, the name and address of the child who
 15 34 allegedly committed the delinquent act, and the disposition
 15 35 of the complaint. If the alleged delinquent act would be
 16  1 a forcible felony if committed by an adult, the intake or
 16  2 juvenile court officer shall provide notification to the victim
 16  3 as required by Code section 915.24.
 16  4    SEALING OF JUVENILE COURT RECORDS UNAVAILABLE FOR
 16  5 OPERATING=WHILE=INTOXICATED VIOLATIONS.  Under current Code
 16  6 section 232.150, a court shall order juvenile court records
 16  7 to be sealed if the person who is the subject of the juvenile
 16  8 court records is 18 years of age or older and 2 years have
 16  9 elapsed since the last official action in the person's case,
 16 10 the person has not been subsequently convicted of a felony
 16 11 or an aggravated or serious misdemeanor or adjudicated a
 16 12 delinquent child for an act which if committed by an adult
 16 13 would be a felony, an aggravated misdemeanor, or a serious
 16 14 misdemeanor and no proceeding is pending seeking such
 16 15 conviction or adjudication, and the person was not placed on
 16 16 youthful offender status, transferred back to district court
 16 17 after the youthful offender's 18th birthday, and sentenced for
 16 18 the offense which precipitated the youthful offender placement.
 16 19 The bill in newly designated Code section 232.150(4) provides
 16 20 that the court shall not seal a person's juvenile court records
 16 21 if the person was adjudicated delinquent for violating Code
 16 22 section 321J.2, which prohibits the operation of a motor
 16 23 vehicle while under the influence of alcohol or a drug.
 16 24    RELEASE OF CONFIDENTIAL RECORDS.  The bill provides that a
 16 25 public record which is confidential under the provisions of
 16 26 Code chapter 232 shall only be subject to release upon order of
 16 27 a court in a proceeding under Code chapter 232.
 16 28    EXISTING CONFIDENTIALITY EXEMPTIONS.  The bill retains
 16 29 certain existing exemptions to confidentiality of juvenile
 16 30 court records. Pursuant to Code section 692A.121(8), records
 16 31 concerning sex offense convictions which are committed by
 16 32 minors may be released in the same manner as records of
 16 33 convictions of adults. Pursuant to Code section 915.10A,
 16 34 information concerning a juvenile charged with a felony offense
 16 35 may be released pursuant to an automated victim notification
 17  1 system. Under the bill, these exemptions to confidentiality
 17  2 are not amended and therefore still apply to juvenile court
 17  3 records.
 17  4    RIGHT TO COUNSEL.  The bill in Code section 232.11 provides
 17  5 that a child has the right to be represented by counsel at a

 17  7 or a public records order under Code section 232.149B.

 12 21 complaint alleging the commission of a delinquent act that
 12 22 would be a forcible felony if committed by an adult shall be
 12 23 public records unless subject to a confidentiality order under
 12 24 Code section 232.149A or a sealing order under Code section
 12 25 232.150.  However, the bill provides that such official records
 12 26 shall not be available to the public or any governmental
 12 27 agency through the internet or in an electronic customized
 12 28 data report unless the child has been adjudicated delinquent
 12 29 in the matter.  Nevertheless, the bill provides that official
 12 30 juvenile court records may be disclosed without a court order
 12 31 through the internet or in an electronic customized data
 12 32 report prior to the child being adjudicated delinquent to the
 12 33 judge and professional court staff, including juvenile court

 13  7 of human services; the department of corrections; a judicial
 13  8 district department of correctional services; and the board of
 13  9 parole.
 13 10    CONFIDENTIALITY OF TRANSCRIPTS.  The bill in newly
 13 11 designated Code section 232.147(3B) provides that if the court
 13 12 has excluded the public from a hearing pursuant to Code section
 13 13 232.39 or 232.92, the transcript of the proceedings shall not
 13 14 be deemed a public record and inspection and disclosure of
 13 15 the contents of the transcript shall not be permitted except
 13 16 pursuant to a court order or unless otherwise provided in Code
 13 17 chapter 232.
 13 18    USE OF ADJUDICATION OF DELINQUENCY FOR PENALTY ENHANCEMENTS
 13 19 OR EVIDENCE.  The bill in newly designated Code section
 13 20 232.147(13) provides that the confidentiality of a final
 13 21 adjudication of delinquency under Code section 232.147 or
 13 22 pursuant to Code section 232.149A shall not prohibit the state
 13 23 from pleading or proving the adjudication at a subsequent
 13 24 criminal or delinquency proceeding for the purpose of penalty
 13 25 enhancement when a provision of the Code specifically deems the
 13 26 delinquency adjudication to constitute a final conviction.
 13 27    The bill in newly designated Code section 232.147(14)
 13 28 provides that the provisions of the bill shall not be construed
 13 29 to limit or restrict the production, use, or introduction
 13 30 of official juvenile court records in any juvenile or adult
 13 31 criminal proceeding, where such records are relevant and deemed
 13 32 admissible under any other provision of the law.
 13 33    CONFIDENTIALITY OF RECORDS AND FILES OF CRIMINAL OR
 13 34 JUVENILE JUSTICE AGENCIES.  Under current law, records and
 13 35 files of a criminal or juvenile justice agency concerning
 14  1 a child involved in a delinquent act are public records,
 14  2 subject to certain exceptions. The bill in Code section
 14  3 232.149 provides that the records and files of a criminal or
 14  4 juvenile justice agency, an intake officer, or a juvenile court
 14  5 officer concerning a child involved in a delinquent act are
 14  6 confidential. The bill further provides that the records of an
 14  7 intake officer or juvenile court officer containing a dismissal
 14  8 of a complaint or an informal adjustment of a complaint when
 14  9 no petition is filed relating to the complaint, shall not be
 14 10 available to the public, but may be disclosed to the judge and
 14 11 professional court staff, including juvenile court officers;
 14 12 the child's counsel or guardian ad litem; the county attorney
 14 13 and county attorney's assistants;  the superintendent or the
 14 14 superintendent's designee of the school district for the
 14 15 school attended by the child or the authorities in charge of
 14 16 an accredited nonpublic school attended by the child; a member
 14 17 of the armed forces of the United States who is conducting a
 14 18 background investigation of an individual pursuant to federal
 14 19 law; the statistical analysis center for the purposes stated
 14 20 in Code section 216A.136; the state public defender;  the
 14 21 department of human services; and the alleged victim of the
 14 22 delinquent act.
 14 23    PUBLIC RECORDS HEARINGS.  The bill enacts new Code section
 14 24 232.149B, which provides that a person may apply for a court
 14 25 order to make confidential juvenile court records public.
 14 26 The bill provides that a rebuttable presumption exists that
 14 27 official juvenile court records shall remain confidential. The
 14 28 bill provides that the court shall order the official juvenile
 14 29 court records in such a delinquency proceeding to be public
 14 30 records if either the public's interest in making the records
 14 31 public outweighs the juvenile's interest in maintaining the
 14 32 confidentiality of the records or the juvenile has been placed
 14 33 on youthful offender status pursuant to Code section 232.45(7)
 14 34 and Code section 907.3A(1), and will be transferred back to
 14 35 the district court for sentencing prior to the child's 18th
 15  1 birthday. The court may order the official juvenile court
 15  2 records in such a delinquency proceeding to be public records
 15  3 if the juvenile has been subsequently adjudicated delinquent
 15  4 for a public offense that would be a serious misdemeanor,
 15  5 aggravated misdemeanor, or felony offense if committed by an
 15  6 adult, or another delinquency proceeding is pending seeking
 15  7 such an adjudication. The bill provides that records subject
 15  8 to a public records order may be sealed at a later date
 15  9 pursuant to Code section 232.150.
 15 10    RIGHT TO REVIEW AND RELEASE A CONFIDENTIAL COMPLAINT.  The
 15 11 bill provides that delinquency complaints shall be released
 15 12 in accordance with Code section 915.25. Under current Code
 15 13 section 915.25, a complaint which alleges that a child who is
 15 14 at least 10 years of age committed a delinquent act, which if
 15 15 committed by an adult would be a public offense, is a public
 15 16 record. Current Code section 915.25 authorizes the court,
 15 17 its designee, or law enforcement officials to release such
 15 18 a complaint, including the identity of the child. The bill
 15 19 amends Code section 915.25 to provide that such a complaint
 15 20 is confidential unless the complaint alleges that the child
 15 21 committed a delinquent act that if committed by an adult would
 15 22 be a forcible felony. However, the bill authorizes state and
 15 23 local enforcement officials to release a confidential complaint
 15 24 against a child if the child is at large and doing so is deemed
 15 25 necessary for the protection of the public or the safety of
 15 26 the child. If the complaint is not confidential because the
 15 27 alleged delinquent act is an act that would be a forcible
 15 28 felony if committed by an adult, the court, its designee,
 15 29 or law enforcement officials may release such a complaint,
 15 30 including the identity of the child.
 15 31    The bill provides that an intake or juvenile court officer
 15 32 shall disclose to the alleged victim of a delinquent act, upon
 15 33 request, the complaint, the name and address of the child who
 15 34 allegedly committed the delinquent act, and the disposition
 15 35 of the complaint. If the alleged delinquent act would be
 16  1 a forcible felony if committed by an adult, the intake or
 16  2 juvenile court officer shall provide notification to the victim
 16  3 as required by Code section 915.24.
 16  4    SEALING OF JUVENILE COURT RECORDS UNAVAILABLE FOR
 16  5 OPERATING=WHILE=INTOXICATED VIOLATIONS.  Under current Code
 16  6 section 232.150, a court shall order juvenile court records
 16  7 to be sealed if the person who is the subject of the juvenile
 16  8 court records is 18 years of age or older and 2 years have
 16  9 elapsed since the last official action in the person's case,
 16 10 the person has not been subsequently convicted of a felony
 16 11 or an aggravated or serious misdemeanor or adjudicated a
 16 12 delinquent child for an act which if committed by an adult
 16 13 would be a felony, an aggravated misdemeanor, or a serious
 16 14 misdemeanor and no proceeding is pending seeking such
 16 15 conviction or adjudication, and the person was not placed on
 16 16 youthful offender status, transferred back to district court
 16 17 after the youthful offender's 18th birthday, and sentenced for
 16 18 the offense which precipitated the youthful offender placement.
 16 19 The bill in newly designated Code section 232.150(4) provides
 16 20 that the court shall not seal a person's juvenile court records
 16 21 if the person was adjudicated delinquent for violating Code
 16 22 section 321J.2, which prohibits the operation of a motor
 16 23 vehicle while under the influence of alcohol or a drug.
 16 24    RELEASE OF CONFIDENTIAL RECORDS.  The bill provides that a
 16 25 public record which is confidential under the provisions of
 16 26 Code chapter 232 shall only be subject to release upon order of
 16 27 a court in a proceeding under Code chapter 232.
 16 28    EXISTING CONFIDENTIALITY EXEMPTIONS.  The bill retains
 16 29 certain existing exemptions to confidentiality of juvenile
 16 30 court records. Pursuant to Code section 692A.121(8), records
 16 31 concerning sex offense convictions which are committed by
 16 32 minors may be released in the same manner as records of
 16 33 convictions of adults. Pursuant to Code section 915.10A,
 16 34 information concerning a juvenile charged with a felony offense
 16 35 may be released pursuant to an automated victim notification
 17  1 system. Under the bill, these exemptions to confidentiality
 17  2 are not amended and therefore still apply to juvenile court
 17  3 records.
 17  4    RIGHT TO COUNSEL.  The bill in Code section 232.11 provides
 17  5 that a child has the right to be represented by counsel at a
 17  6 hearing on a confidentiality order under Code section 232.149A
 17  7 or a public records order under Code section 232.149B.
 17  8    APPLICABILITY.  The bill applies to juvenile delinquency
 17  9 proceedings which are pending or arise on or after July 1,
 17 10 2016.
       LSB 5193HV (4) 86
       jh/rj
 12 19    The bill in newly designated Code section 232.147(3A)
 12 20 provides that juvenile court records containing a petition or
 12 21 complaint alleging the commission of a delinquent act that
 12 22 would be a forcible felony if committed by an adult shall be
 12 23 public records unless subject to a confidentiality order under
 12 24 Code section 232.149A or a sealing order under Code section
 12 25 232.150.  However, the bill provides that such official records
 12 26 shall not be available to the public or any governmental
 12 27 agency through the internet or in an electronic customized
 12 28 data report unless the child has been adjudicated delinquent
 12 29 in the matter.  Nevertheless, the bill provides that official
 12 30 juvenile court records may be disclosed without a court order
 12 31 through the internet or in an electronic customized data
 12 32 report prior to the child being adjudicated delinquent to the
 12 33 judge and professional court staff, including juvenile court
 12 34 officers; the child's counsel or guardian ad litem; the county
 12 35 attorney and the county attorney's assistants; a court, court
 13  1 professional staff, and adult probation officers in connection
 13  2 with the preparation of a presentence report concerning a
 13  3 person who prior thereto had been the subject of a juvenile
 13  4 court proceeding; a state or local law enforcement agency; the
 13  5 state public defender; the statistical analysis center for
 13  6 the purposes stated in Code section 216A.136; the department
 13  7 of human services; the department of corrections; a judicial
 13  8 district department of correctional services; and the board of
 13  9 parole.
 13 10    CONFIDENTIALITY OF TRANSCRIPTS.  The bill in newly
 13 11 designated Code section 232.147(3B) provides that if the court
 13 12 has excluded the public from a hearing pursuant to Code section
 13 13 232.39 or 232.92, the transcript of the proceedings shall not
 13 14 be deemed a public record and inspection and disclosure of
 13 15 the contents of the transcript shall not be permitted except
 13 16 pursuant to a court order or unless otherwise provided in Code
 13 17 chapter 232.
 13 18    USE OF ADJUDICATION OF DELINQUENCY FOR PENALTY ENHANCEMENTS
 13 19 OR EVIDENCE.  The bill in newly designated Code section
 13 20 232.147(13) provides that the confidentiality of a final
 13 21 adjudication of delinquency under Code section 232.147 or
 13 22 pursuant to Code section 232.149A shall not prohibit the state
 13 23 from pleading or proving the adjudication at a subsequent
 13 24 criminal or delinquency proceeding for the purpose of penalty
 13 25 enhancement when a provision of the Code specifically deems the
 13 26 delinquency adjudication to constitute a final conviction.
 13 27    The bill in newly designated Code section 232.147(14)
 13 28 provides that the provisions of the bill shall not be construed
 13 29 to limit or restrict the production, use, or introduction
 13 30 of official juvenile court records in any juvenile or adult
 13 31 criminal proceeding, where such records are relevant and deemed
 13 32 admissible under any other provision of the law.
 13 33    CONFIDENTIALITY OF RECORDS AND FILES OF CRIMINAL OR
 13 34 JUVENILE JUSTICE AGENCIES.  Under current law, records and
 13 35 files of a criminal or juvenile justice agency concerning
 14  1 a child involved in a delinquent act are public records,
 14  2 subject to certain exceptions. The bill in Code section
 14  3 232.149 provides that the records and files of a criminal or
 14  4 juvenile justice agency, an intake officer, or a juvenile court
 14  5 officer concerning a child involved in a delinquent act are
 14  6 confidential. The bill further provides that the records of an
 14  7 intake officer or juvenile court officer containing a dismissal
 14  8 of a complaint or an informal adjustment of a complaint when
 14  9 no petition is filed relating to the complaint, shall not be
 14 10 available to the public, but may be disclosed to the judge and
 14 11 professional court staff, including juvenile court officers;
 14 12 the child's counsel or guardian ad litem; the county attorney
 14 13 and county attorney's assistants;  the superintendent or the
 14 14 superintendent's designee of the school district for the
 14 15 school attended by the child or the authorities in charge of
 14 16 an accredited nonpublic school attended by the child; a member
 14 17 of the armed forces of the United States who is conducting a
 14 18 background investigation of an individual pursuant to federal
 14 19 law; the statistical analysis center for the purposes stated
 14 20 in Code section 216A.136; the state public defender;  the
 14 21 department of human services; and the alleged victim of the
 14 22 delinquent act.
 14 23    PUBLIC RECORDS HEARINGS.  The bill enacts new Code section
 14 24 232.149B, which provides that a person may apply for a court
 14 25 order to make confidential juvenile court records public.
 14 26 The bill provides that a rebuttable presumption exists that
 14 27 official juvenile court records shall remain confidential. The
 14 28 bill provides that the court shall order the official juvenile
 14 29 court records in such a delinquency proceeding to be public
 14 30 records if either the public's interest in making the records
 14 31 public outweighs the juvenile's interest in maintaining the
 14 32 confidentiality of the records or the juvenile has been placed
 14 33 on youthful offender status pursuant to Code section 232.45(7)
 14 34 and Code section 907.3A(1), and will be transferred back to
 14 35 the district court for sentencing prior to the child's 18th
 15  1 birthday. The court may order the official juvenile court
 15  2 records in such a delinquency proceeding to be public records
 15  3 if the juvenile has been subsequently adjudicated delinquent
 15  4 for a public offense that would be a serious misdemeanor,
 15  5 aggravated misdemeanor, or felony offense if committed by an
 15  6 adult, or another delinquency proceeding is pending seeking
 15  7 such an adjudication. The bill provides that records subject
 15  8 to a public records order may be sealed at a later date
 15  9 pursuant to Code section 232.150.
 15 10    RIGHT TO REVIEW AND RELEASE A CONFIDENTIAL COMPLAINT.  The
 15 11 bill provides that delinquency complaints shall be released
 15 12 in accordance with Code section 915.25. Under current Code
 15 13 section 915.25, a complaint which alleges that a child who is
 15 14 at least 10 years of age committed a delinquent act, which if
 15 15 committed by an adult would be a public offense, is a public
 15 16 record. Current Code section 915.25 authorizes the court,
 15 17 its designee, or law enforcement officials to release such
 15 18 a complaint, including the identity of the child. The bill
 15 19 amends Code section 915.25 to provide that such a complaint
 15 20 is confidential unless the complaint alleges that the child
 15 21 committed a delinquent act that if committed by an adult would
 15 22 be a forcible felony. However, the bill authorizes state and
 15 23 local enforcement officials to release a confidential complaint
 15 24 against a child if the child is at large and doing so is deemed
 15 25 necessary for the protection of the public or the safety of
 15 26 the child. If the complaint is not confidential because the
 15 27 alleged delinquent act is an act that would be a forcible
 15 28 felony if committed by an adult, the court, its designee,
 15 29 or law enforcement officials may release such a complaint,
 15 30 including the identity of the child.
 15 31    The bill provides that an intake or juvenile court officer
 15 32 shall disclose to the alleged victim of a delinquent act, upon
 15 33 request, the complaint, the name and address of the child who
 15 34 allegedly committed the delinquent act, and the disposition
 15 35 of the complaint. If the alleged delinquent act would be
 16  1 a forcible felony if committed by an adult, the intake or
 16  2 juvenile court officer shall provide notification to the victim
 16  3 as required by Code section 915.24.
 16  4    SEALING OF JUVENILE COURT RECORDS UNAVAILABLE FOR
 16  5 OPERATING=WHILE=INTOXICATED VIOLATIONS.  Under current Code
 16  6 section 232.150, a court shall order juvenile court records
 16  7 to be sealed if the person who is the subject of the juvenile
 16  8 court records is 18 years of age or older and 2 years have
 16  9 elapsed since the last official action in the person's case,
 16 10 the person has not been subsequently convicted of a felony
 16 11 or an aggravated or serious misdemeanor or adjudicated a
 16 12 delinquent child for an act which if committed by an adult
 16 13 would be a felony, an aggravated misdemeanor, or a serious
 16 14 misdemeanor and no proceeding is pending seeking such
 16 15 conviction or adjudication, and the person was not placed on
 16 16 youthful offender status, transferred back to district court
 16 17 after the youthful offender's 18th birthday, and sentenced for
 16 18 the offense which precipitated the youthful offender placement.
 16 19 The bill in newly designated Code section 232.150(4) provides
 16 20 that the court shall not seal a person's juvenile court records
 16 21 if the person was adjudicated delinquent for violating Code
 16 22 section 321J.2, which prohibits the operation of a motor
 16 23 vehicle while under the influence of alcohol or a drug.
 16 24    RELEASE OF CONFIDENTIAL RECORDS.  The bill provides that a
 16 25 public record which is confidential under the provisions of
 16 26 Code chapter 232 shall only be subject to release upon order of
 16 27 a court in a proceeding under Code chapter 232.
 16 28    EXISTING CONFIDENTIALITY EXEMPTIONS.  The bill retains
 16 29 certain existing exemptions to confidentiality of juvenile
 16 30 court records. Pursuant to Code section 692A.121(8), records
 16 31 concerning sex offense convictions which are committed by
 16 32 minors may be released in the same manner as records of
 16 33 convictions of adults. Pursuant to Code section 915.10A,
 16 34 information concerning a juvenile charged with a felony offense
 16 35 may be released pursuant to an automated victim notification
 17  1 system. Under the bill, these exemptions to confidentiality
 17  2 are not amended and therefore still apply to juvenile court
 17  3 records.
 17  4    RIGHT TO COUNSEL.  The bill in Code section 232.11 provides
 17  5 that a child has the right to be represented by counsel at a
 17  6 hearing on a confidentiality order under Code section 232.149A
 17  7 or a public records order under Code section 232.149B.
 17  8    APPLICABILITY.  The bill applies to juvenile delinquency
 17  9 proceedings which are pending or arise on or after July 1,
 17 10 2016.
       LSB 5193HV (4) 86
       jh/rj
 12 20 provides that juvenile court records containing a petition or
 12 21 complaint alleging the commission of a delinquent act that
 12 22 would be a forcible felony if committed by an adult shall be
 12 23 public records unless subject to a confidentiality order under
 12 24 Code section 232.149A or a sealing order under Code section
 12 25 232.150.  However, the bill provides that such official records
 12 26 shall not be available to the public or any governmental
 12 27 agency through the internet or in an electronic customized
 12 28 data report unless the child has been adjudicated delinquent
 12 29 in the matter.  Nevertheless, the bill provides that official
 12 30 juvenile court records may be disclosed without a court order
 12 31 through the internet or in an electronic customized data
 12 32 report prior to the child being adjudicated delinquent to the
 12 33 judge and professional court staff, including juvenile court
 12 34 officers; the child's counsel or guardian ad litem; the county
 12 35 attorney and the county attorney's assistants; a court, court
 13  1 professional staff, and adult probation officers in connection
 13  2 with the preparation of a presentence report concerning a
 13  3 person who prior thereto had been the subject of a juvenile
 13  4 court proceeding; a state or local law enforcement agency; the
 13  5 state public defender; the statistical analysis center for
 13  6 the purposes stated in Code section 216A.136; the department
 13  7 of human services; the department of corrections; a judicial
 13  8 district department of correctional services; and the board of
 13  9 parole.
 13 10    CONFIDENTIALITY OF TRANSCRIPTS.  The bill in newly
 13 11 designated Code section 232.147(3B) provides that if the court
 13 12 has excluded the public from a hearing pursuant to Code section
 13 13 232.39 or 232.92, the transcript of the proceedings shall not
 13 14 be deemed a public record and inspection and disclosure of
 13 15 the contents of the transcript shall not be permitted except
 13 16 pursuant to a court order or unless otherwise provided in Code
 13 17 chapter 232.
 13 18    USE OF ADJUDICATION OF DELINQUENCY FOR PENALTY ENHANCEMENTS
 13 19 OR EVIDENCE.  The bill in newly designated Code section
 13 20 232.147(13) provides that the confidentiality of a final
 13 21 adjudication of delinquency under Code section 232.147 or
 13 22 pursuant to Code section 232.149A shall not prohibit the state
 13 23 from pleading or proving the adjudication at a subsequent
 13 24 criminal or delinquency proceeding for the purpose of penalty
 13 25 enhancement when a provision of the Code specifically deems the
 13 26 delinquency adjudication to constitute a final conviction.
 13 27    The bill in newly designated Code section 232.147(14)
 13 28 provides that the provisions of the bill shall not be construed
 13 29 to limit or restrict the production, use, or introduction
 13 30 of official juvenile court records in any juvenile or adult
 13 31 criminal proceeding, where such records are relevant and deemed
 13 32 admissible under any other provision of the law.
 13 33    CONFIDENTIALITY OF RECORDS AND FILES OF CRIMINAL OR
 13 34 JUVENILE JUSTICE AGENCIES.  Under current law, records and
 13 35 files of a criminal or juvenile justice agency concerning
 14  1 a child involved in a delinquent act are public records,
 14  2 subject to certain exceptions. The bill in Code section
 14  3 232.149 provides that the records and files of a criminal or
 14  4 juvenile justice agency, an intake officer, or a juvenile court
 14  5 officer concerning a child involved in a delinquent act are
 14  6 confidential. The bill further provides that the records of an
 14  7 intake officer or juvenile court officer containing a dismissal
 14  8 of a complaint or an informal adjustment of a complaint when
 14  9 no petition is filed relating to the complaint, shall not be
 14 10 available to the public, but may be disclosed to the judge and
 14 11 professional court staff, including juvenile court officers;
 14 12 the child's counsel or guardian ad litem; the county attorney
 14 13 and county attorney's assistants;  the superintendent or the
 14 14 superintendent's designee of the school district for the
 14 15 school attended by the child or the authorities in charge of
 14 16 an accredited nonpublic school attended by the child; a member
 14 17 of the armed forces of the United States who is conducting a
 14 18 background investigation of an individual pursuant to federal
 14 19 law; the statistical analysis center for the purposes stated
 14 20 in Code section 216A.136; the state public defender;  the
 14 21 department of human services; and the alleged victim of the
 14 22 delinquent act.
 14 23    PUBLIC RECORDS HEARINGS.  The bill enacts new Code section
 14 24 232.149B, which provides that a person may apply for a court
 14 25 order to make confidential juvenile court records public.
 14 26 The bill provides that a rebuttable presumption exists that
 14 27 official juvenile court records shall remain confidential. The
 14 28 bill provides that the court shall order the official juvenile
 14 29 court records in such a delinquency proceeding to be public
 14 30 records if either the public's interest in making the records
 14 31 public outweighs the juvenile's interest in maintaining the
 14 32 confidentiality of the records or the juvenile has been placed
 14 33 on youthful offender status pursuant to Code section 232.45(7)
 14 34 and Code section 907.3A(1), and will be transferred back to
 14 35 the district court for sentencing prior to the child's 18th
 15  1 birthday. The court may order the official juvenile court
 15  2 records in such a delinquency proceeding to be public records
 15  3 if the juvenile has been subsequently adjudicated delinquent
 15  4 for a public offense that would be a serious misdemeanor,
 15  5 aggravated misdemeanor, or felony offense if committed by an
 15  6 adult, or another delinquency proceeding is pending seeking
 15  7 such an adjudication. The bill provides that records subject
 15  8 to a public records order may be sealed at a later date
 15  9 pursuant to Code section 232.150.
 15 10    RIGHT TO REVIEW AND RELEASE A CONFIDENTIAL COMPLAINT.  The
 15 11 bill provides that delinquency complaints shall be released
 15 12 in accordance with Code section 915.25. Under current Code
 15 13 section 915.25, a complaint which alleges that a child who is
 15 14 at least 10 years of age committed a delinquent act, which if
 15 15 committed by an adult would be a public offense, is a public
 15 16 record. Current Code section 915.25 authorizes the court,
 15 17 its designee, or law enforcement officials to release such
 15 18 a complaint, including the identity of the child. The bill
 15 19 amends Code section 915.25 to provide that such a complaint
 15 20 is confidential unless the complaint alleges that the child
 15 21 committed a delinquent act that if committed by an adult would
 15 22 be a forcible felony. However, the bill authorizes state and
 15 23 local enforcement officials to release a confidential complaint
 15 24 against a child if the child is at large and doing so is deemed
 15 25 necessary for the protection of the public or the safety of
 15 26 the child. If the complaint is not confidential because the
 15 27 alleged delinquent act is an act that would be a forcible
 15 28 felony if committed by an adult, the court, its designee,
 15 29 or law enforcement officials may release such a complaint,
 15 30 including the identity of the child.
 15 31    The bill provides that an intake or juvenile court officer
 15 32 shall disclose to the alleged victim of a delinquent act, upon
 15 33 request, the complaint, the name and address of the child who
 15 34 allegedly committed the delinquent act, and the disposition
 15 35 of the complaint. If the alleged delinquent act would be
 16  1 a forcible felony if committed by an adult, the intake or
 16  2 juvenile court officer shall provide notification to the victim
 16  3 as required by Code section 915.24.
 16  4    SEALING OF JUVENILE COURT RECORDS UNAVAILABLE FOR
 16  5 OPERATING=WHILE=INTOXICATED VIOLATIONS.  Under current Code
 16  6 section 232.150, a court shall order juvenile court records
 16  7 to be sealed if the person who is the subject of the juvenile
 16  8 court records is 18 years of age or older and 2 years have
 16  9 elapsed since the last official action in the person's case,
 16 10 the person has not been subsequently convicted of a felony
 16 11 or an aggravated or serious misdemeanor or adjudicated a
 16 12 delinquent child for an act which if committed by an adult
 16 13 would be a felony, an aggravated misdemeanor, or a serious
 16 14 misdemeanor and no proceeding is pending seeking such
 16 15 conviction or adjudication, and the person was not placed on
 16 16 youthful offender status, transferred back to district court
 16 17 after the youthful offender's 18th birthday, and sentenced for
 16 18 the offense which precipitated the youthful offender placement.
 16 19 The bill in newly designated Code section 232.150(4) provides
 16 20 that the court shall not seal a person's juvenile court records
 16 21 if the person was adjudicated delinquent for violating Code
 16 22 section 321J.2, which prohibits the operation of a motor
 16 23 vehicle while under the influence of alcohol or a drug.
 16 24    RELEASE OF CONFIDENTIAL RECORDS.  The bill provides that a
 16 25 public record which is confidential under the provisions of
 16 26 Code chapter 232 shall only be subject to release upon order of
 16 27 a court in a proceeding under Code chapter 232.
 16 28    EXISTING CONFIDENTIALITY EXEMPTIONS.  The bill retains
 16 29 certain existing exemptions to confidentiality of juvenile
 16 30 court records. Pursuant to Code section 692A.121(8), records
 16 31 concerning sex offense convictions which are committed by
 16 32 minors may be released in the same manner as records of
 16 33 convictions of adults. Pursuant to Code section 915.10A,
 16 34 information concerning a juvenile charged with a felony offense
 16 35 may be released pursuant to an automated victim notification
 17  1 system. Under the bill, these exemptions to confidentiality
 17  2 are not amended and therefore still apply to juvenile court
 17  3 records.
 17  4    RIGHT TO COUNSEL.  The bill in Code section 232.11 provides
 17  5 that a child has the right to be represented by counsel at a
 17  6 hearing on a confidentiality order under Code section 232.149A
 17  7 or a public records order under Code section 232.149B.
 17  8    APPLICABILITY.  The bill applies to juvenile delinquency
 17  9 proceedings which are pending or arise on or after July 1,
 17 10 2016.

       jh/rj
 12 21 complaint alleging the commission of a delinquent act that
 12 22 would be a forcible felony if committed by an adult shall be
 12 23 public records unless subject to a confidentiality order under
 12 24 Code section 232.149A or a sealing order under Code section
 12 25 232.150.  However, the bill provides that such official records
 12 26 shall not be available to the public or any governmental
 12 27 agency through the internet or in an electronic customized
 12 28 data report unless the child has been adjudicated delinquent
 12 29 in the matter.  Nevertheless, the bill provides that official
 12 30 juvenile court records may be disclosed without a court order
 12 31 through the internet or in an electronic customized data
 12 32 report prior to the child being adjudicated delinquent to the
 12 33 judge and professional court staff, including juvenile court
 12 34 officers; the child's counsel or guardian ad litem; the county
 12 35 attorney and the county attorney's assistants; a court, court
 13  1 professional staff, and adult probation officers in connection
 13  2 with the preparation of a presentence report concerning a
 13  3 person who prior thereto had been the subject of a juvenile
 13  4 court proceeding; a state or local law enforcement agency; the
 13  5 state public defender; the statistical analysis center for
 13  6 the purposes stated in Code section 216A.136; the department
 13  7 of human services; the department of corrections; a judicial
 13  8 district department of correctional services; and the board of
 13  9 parole.
 13 10    CONFIDENTIALITY OF TRANSCRIPTS.  The bill in newly
 13 11 designated Code section 232.147(3B) provides that if the court
 13 12 has excluded the public from a hearing pursuant to Code section
 13 13 232.39 or 232.92, the transcript of the proceedings shall not
 13 14 be deemed a public record and inspection and disclosure of
 13 15 the contents of the transcript shall not be permitted except
 13 16 pursuant to a court order or unless otherwise provided in Code
 13 17 chapter 232.
 13 18    USE OF ADJUDICATION OF DELINQUENCY FOR PENALTY ENHANCEMENTS
 13 19 OR EVIDENCE.  The bill in newly designated Code section
 13 20 232.147(13) provides that the confidentiality of a final
 13 21 adjudication of delinquency under Code section 232.147 or
 13 22 pursuant to Code section 232.149A shall not prohibit the state
 13 23 from pleading or proving the adjudication at a subsequent
 13 24 criminal or delinquency proceeding for the purpose of penalty
 13 25 enhancement when a provision of the Code specifically deems the
 13 26 delinquency adjudication to constitute a final conviction.
 13 27    The bill in newly designated Code section 232.147(14)
 13 28 provides that the provisions of the bill shall not be construed
 13 29 to limit or restrict the production, use, or introduction
 13 30 of official juvenile court records in any juvenile or adult
 13 31 criminal proceeding, where such records are relevant and deemed
 13 32 admissible under any other provision of the law.
 13 33    CONFIDENTIALITY OF RECORDS AND FILES OF CRIMINAL OR
 13 34 JUVENILE JUSTICE AGENCIES.  Under current law, records and
 13 35 files of a criminal or juvenile justice agency concerning
 14  1 a child involved in a delinquent act are public records,
 14  2 subject to certain exceptions. The bill in Code section
 14  3 232.149 provides that the records and files of a criminal or
 14  4 juvenile justice agency, an intake officer, or a juvenile court
 14  5 officer concerning a child involved in a delinquent act are
 14  6 confidential. The bill further provides that the records of an
 14  7 intake officer or juvenile court officer containing a dismissal
 14  8 of a complaint or an informal adjustment of a complaint when
 14  9 no petition is filed relating to the complaint, shall not be
 14 10 available to the public, but may be disclosed to the judge and
 14 11 professional court staff, including juvenile court officers;
 14 12 the child's counsel or guardian ad litem; the county attorney
 14 13 and county attorney's assistants;  the superintendent or the
 14 14 superintendent's designee of the school district for the
 14 15 school attended by the child or the authorities in charge of
 14 16 an accredited nonpublic school attended by the child; a member
 14 17 of the armed forces of the United States who is conducting a
 14 18 background investigation of an individual pursuant to federal
 14 19 law; the statistical analysis center for the purposes stated
 14 20 in Code section 216A.136; the state public defender;  the
 14 21 department of human services; and the alleged victim of the
 14 22 delinquent act.
 14 23    PUBLIC RECORDS HEARINGS.  The bill enacts new Code section
 14 24 232.149B, which provides that a person may apply for a court
 14 25 order to make confidential juvenile court records public.
 14 26 The bill provides that a rebuttable presumption exists that
 14 27 official juvenile court records shall remain confidential. The
 14 28 bill provides that the court shall order the official juvenile
 14 29 court records in such a delinquency proceeding to be public
 14 30 records if either the public's interest in making the records
 14 31 public outweighs the juvenile's interest in maintaining the
 14 32 confidentiality of the records or the juvenile has been placed
 14 33 on youthful offender status pursuant to Code section 232.45(7)
 14 34 and Code section 907.3A(1), and will be transferred back to
 14 35 the district court for sentencing prior to the child's 18th
 15  1 birthday. The court may order the official juvenile court
 15  2 records in such a delinquency proceeding to be public records
 15  3 if the juvenile has been subsequently adjudicated delinquent
 15  4 for a public offense that would be a serious misdemeanor,
 15  5 aggravated misdemeanor, or felony offense if committed by an
 15  6 adult, or another delinquency proceeding is pending seeking
 15  7 such an adjudication. The bill provides that records subject
 15  8 to a public records order may be sealed at a later date
 15  9 pursuant to Code section 232.150.
 15 10    RIGHT TO REVIEW AND RELEASE A CONFIDENTIAL COMPLAINT.  The
 15 11 bill provides that delinquency complaints shall be released
 15 12 in accordance with Code section 915.25. Under current Code
 15 13 section 915.25, a complaint which alleges that a child who is
 15 14 at least 10 years of age committed a delinquent act, which if
 15 15 committed by an adult would be a public offense, is a public
 15 16 record. Current Code section 915.25 authorizes the court,
 15 17 its designee, or law enforcement officials to release such
 15 18 a complaint, including the identity of the child. The bill
 15 19 amends Code section 915.25 to provide that such a complaint
 15 20 is confidential unless the complaint alleges that the child
 15 21 committed a delinquent act that if committed by an adult would
 15 22 be a forcible felony. However, the bill authorizes state and
 15 23 local enforcement officials to release a confidential complaint
 15 24 against a child if the child is at large and doing so is deemed
 15 25 necessary for the protection of the public or the safety of
 15 26 the child. If the complaint is not confidential because the
 15 27 alleged delinquent act is an act that would be a forcible
 15 28 felony if committed by an adult, the court, its designee,
 15 29 or law enforcement officials may release such a complaint,
 15 30 including the identity of the child.
 15 31    The bill provides that an intake or juvenile court officer
 15 32 shall disclose to the alleged victim of a delinquent act, upon
 15 33 request, the complaint, the name and address of the child who
 15 34 allegedly committed the delinquent act, and the disposition
 15 35 of the complaint. If the alleged delinquent act would be
 16  1 a forcible felony if committed by an adult, the intake or
 16  2 juvenile court officer shall provide notification to the victim
 16  3 as required by Code section 915.24.
 16  4    SEALING OF JUVENILE COURT RECORDS UNAVAILABLE FOR
 16  5 OPERATING=WHILE=INTOXICATED VIOLATIONS.  Under current Code
 16  6 section 232.150, a court shall order juvenile court records
 16  7 to be sealed if the person who is the subject of the juvenile
 16  8 court records is 18 years of age or older and 2 years have
 16  9 elapsed since the last official action in the person's case,
 16 10 the person has not been subsequently convicted of a felony
 16 11 or an aggravated or serious misdemeanor or adjudicated a
 16 12 delinquent child for an act which if committed by an adult
 16 13 would be a felony, an aggravated misdemeanor, or a serious
 16 14 misdemeanor and no proceeding is pending seeking such
 16 15 conviction or adjudication, and the person was not placed on
 16 16 youthful offender status, transferred back to district court
 16 17 after the youthful offender's 18th birthday, and sentenced for
 16 18 the offense which precipitated the youthful offender placement.
 16 19 The bill in newly designated Code section 232.150(4) provides
 16 20 that the court shall not seal a person's juvenile court records
 16 21 if the person was adjudicated delinquent for violating Code
 16 22 section 321J.2, which prohibits the operation of a motor
 16 23 vehicle while under the influence of alcohol or a drug.
 16 24    RELEASE OF CONFIDENTIAL RECORDS.  The bill provides that a
 16 25 public record which is confidential under the provisions of
 16 26 Code chapter 232 shall only be subject to release upon order of
 16 27 a court in a proceeding under Code chapter 232.
 16 28    EXISTING CONFIDENTIALITY EXEMPTIONS.  The bill retains
 16 29 certain existing exemptions to confidentiality of juvenile
 16 30 court records. Pursuant to Code section 692A.121(8), records
 16 31 concerning sex offense convictions which are committed by
 16 32 minors may be released in the same manner as records of
 16 33 convictions of adults. Pursuant to Code section 915.10A,
 16 34 information concerning a juvenile charged with a felony offense
 16 35 may be released pursuant to an automated victim notification
 17  1 system. Under the bill, these exemptions to confidentiality
 17  2 are not amended and therefore still apply to juvenile court
 17  3 records.
 17  4    RIGHT TO COUNSEL.  The bill in Code section 232.11 provides
 17  5 that a child has the right to be represented by counsel at a
 17  6 hearing on a confidentiality order under Code section 232.149A
 17  7 or a public records order under Code section 232.149B.
 17  8    APPLICABILITY.  The bill applies to juvenile delinquency
 17  9 proceedings which are pending or arise on or after July 1,
 17 10 2016.

 12 22 would be a forcible felony if committed by an adult shall be
 12 23 public records unless subject to a confidentiality order under
 12 24 Code section 232.149A or a sealing order under Code section
 12 25 232.150.  However, the bill provides that such official records
 12 26 shall not be available to the public or any governmental
 12 27 agency through the internet or in an electronic customized
 12 28 data report unless the child has been adjudicated delinquent
 12 29 in the matter.  Nevertheless, the bill provides that official
 12 30 juvenile court records may be disclosed without a court order
 12 31 through the internet or in an electronic customized data
 12 32 report prior to the child being adjudicated delinquent to the
 12 33 judge and professional court staff, including juvenile court
 12 34 officers; the child's counsel or guardian ad litem; the county
 12 35 attorney and the county attorney's assistants; a court, court
 13  1 professional staff, and adult probation officers in connection
 13  2 with the preparation of a presentence report concerning a
 13  3 person who prior thereto had been the subject of a juvenile
 13  4 court proceeding; a state or local law enforcement agency; the
 13  5 state public defender; the statistical analysis center for

 13  7 of human services; the department of corrections; a judicial
 13  8 district department of correctional services; and the board of
 13  9 parole.
 13 10    CONFIDENTIALITY OF TRANSCRIPTS.  The bill in newly
 13 11 designated Code section 232.147(3B) provides that if the court
 13 12 has excluded the public from a hearing pursuant to Code section
 13 13 232.39 or 232.92, the transcript of the proceedings shall not
 13 14 be deemed a public record and inspection and disclosure of
 13 15 the contents of the transcript shall not be permitted except
 13 16 pursuant to a court order or unless otherwise provided in Code
 13 17 chapter 232.
 13 18    USE OF ADJUDICATION OF DELINQUENCY FOR PENALTY ENHANCEMENTS
 13 19 OR EVIDENCE.  The bill in newly designated Code section
 13 20 232.147(13) provides that the confidentiality of a final
 13 21 adjudication of delinquency under Code section 232.147 or
 13 22 pursuant to Code section 232.149A shall not prohibit the state
 13 23 from pleading or proving the adjudication at a subsequent
 13 24 criminal or delinquency proceeding for the purpose of penalty
 13 25 enhancement when a provision of the Code specifically deems the
 13 26 delinquency adjudication to constitute a final conviction.
 13 27    The bill in newly designated Code section 232.147(14)
 13 28 provides that the provisions of the bill shall not be construed
 13 29 to limit or restrict the production, use, or introduction
 13 30 of official juvenile court records in any juvenile or adult
 13 31 criminal proceeding, where such records are relevant and deemed
 13 32 admissible under any other provision of the law.
 13 33    CONFIDENTIALITY OF RECORDS AND FILES OF CRIMINAL OR
 13 34 JUVENILE JUSTICE AGENCIES.  Under current law, records and
 13 35 files of a criminal or juvenile justice agency concerning
 14  1 a child involved in a delinquent act are public records,
 14  2 subject to certain exceptions. The bill in Code section
 14  3 232.149 provides that the records and files of a criminal or
 14  4 juvenile justice agency, an intake officer, or a juvenile court
 14  5 officer concerning a child involved in a delinquent act are
 14  6 confidential. The bill further provides that the records of an
 14  7 intake officer or juvenile court officer containing a dismissal
 14  8 of a complaint or an informal adjustment of a complaint when
 14  9 no petition is filed relating to the complaint, shall not be
 14 10 available to the public, but may be disclosed to the judge and
 14 11 professional court staff, including juvenile court officers;
 14 12 the child's counsel or guardian ad litem; the county attorney
 14 13 and county attorney's assistants;  the superintendent or the
 14 14 superintendent's designee of the school district for the
 14 15 school attended by the child or the authorities in charge of
 14 16 an accredited nonpublic school attended by the child; a member
 14 17 of the armed forces of the United States who is conducting a
 14 18 background investigation of an individual pursuant to federal
 14 19 law; the statistical analysis center for the purposes stated
 14 20 in Code section 216A.136; the state public defender;  the
 14 21 department of human services; and the alleged victim of the
 14 22 delinquent act.
 14 23    PUBLIC RECORDS HEARINGS.  The bill enacts new Code section
 14 24 232.149B, which provides that a person may apply for a court
 14 25 order to make confidential juvenile court records public.
 14 26 The bill provides that a rebuttable presumption exists that
 14 27 official juvenile court records shall remain confidential. The
 14 28 bill provides that the court shall order the official juvenile
 14 29 court records in such a delinquency proceeding to be public
 14 30 records if either the public's interest in making the records
 14 31 public outweighs the juvenile's interest in maintaining the
 14 32 confidentiality of the records or the juvenile has been placed
 14 33 on youthful offender status pursuant to Code section 232.45(7)
 14 34 and Code section 907.3A(1), and will be transferred back to
 14 35 the district court for sentencing prior to the child's 18th
 15  1 birthday. The court may order the official juvenile court
 15  2 records in such a delinquency proceeding to be public records
 15  3 if the juvenile has been subsequently adjudicated delinquent
 15  4 for a public offense that would be a serious misdemeanor,
 15  5 aggravated misdemeanor, or felony offense if committed by an
 15  6 adult, or another delinquency proceeding is pending seeking
 15  7 such an adjudication. The bill provides that records subject
 15  8 to a public records order may be sealed at a later date
 15  9 pursuant to Code section 232.150.
 15 10    RIGHT TO REVIEW AND RELEASE A CONFIDENTIAL COMPLAINT.  The
 15 11 bill provides that delinquency complaints shall be released
 15 12 in accordance with Code section 915.25. Under current Code
 15 13 section 915.25, a complaint which alleges that a child who is
 15 14 at least 10 years of age committed a delinquent act, which if
 15 15 committed by an adult would be a public offense, is a public
 15 16 record. Current Code section 915.25 authorizes the court,
 15 17 its designee, or law enforcement officials to release such
 15 18 a complaint, including the identity of the child. The bill
 15 19 amends Code section 915.25 to provide that such a complaint
 15 20 is confidential unless the complaint alleges that the child
 15 21 committed a delinquent act that if committed by an adult would
 15 22 be a forcible felony. However, the bill authorizes state and
 15 23 local enforcement officials to release a confidential complaint
 15 24 against a child if the child is at large and doing so is deemed
 15 25 necessary for the protection of the public or the safety of
 15 26 the child. If the complaint is not confidential because the
 15 27 alleged delinquent act is an act that would be a forcible
 15 28 felony if committed by an adult, the court, its designee,
 15 29 or law enforcement officials may release such a complaint,
 15 30 including the identity of the child.
 15 31    The bill provides that an intake or juvenile court officer
 15 32 shall disclose to the alleged victim of a delinquent act, upon
 15 33 request, the complaint, the name and address of the child who
 15 34 allegedly committed the delinquent act, and the disposition
 15 35 of the complaint. If the alleged delinquent act would be
 16  1 a forcible felony if committed by an adult, the intake or
 16  2 juvenile court officer shall provide notification to the victim
 16  3 as required by Code section 915.24.
 16  4    SEALING OF JUVENILE COURT RECORDS UNAVAILABLE FOR
 16  5 OPERATING=WHILE=INTOXICATED VIOLATIONS.  Under current Code
 16  6 section 232.150, a court shall order juvenile court records
 16  7 to be sealed if the person who is the subject of the juvenile
 16  8 court records is 18 years of age or older and 2 years have
 16  9 elapsed since the last official action in the person's case,
 16 10 the person has not been subsequently convicted of a felony
 16 11 or an aggravated or serious misdemeanor or adjudicated a
 16 12 delinquent child for an act which if committed by an adult
 16 13 would be a felony, an aggravated misdemeanor, or a serious
 16 14 misdemeanor and no proceeding is pending seeking such
 16 15 conviction or adjudication, and the person was not placed on
 16 16 youthful offender status, transferred back to district court
 16 17 after the youthful offender's 18th birthday, and sentenced for
 16 18 the offense which precipitated the youthful offender placement.
 16 19 The bill in newly designated Code section 232.150(4) provides
 16 20 that the court shall not seal a person's juvenile court records
 16 21 if the person was adjudicated delinquent for violating Code
 16 22 section 321J.2, which prohibits the operation of a motor
 16 23 vehicle while under the influence of alcohol or a drug.
 16 24    RELEASE OF CONFIDENTIAL RECORDS.  The bill provides that a
 16 25 public record which is confidential under the provisions of
 16 26 Code chapter 232 shall only be subject to release upon order of
 16 27 a court in a proceeding under Code chapter 232.
 16 28    EXISTING CONFIDENTIALITY EXEMPTIONS.  The bill retains
 16 29 certain existing exemptions to confidentiality of juvenile
 16 30 court records. Pursuant to Code section 692A.121(8), records
 16 31 concerning sex offense convictions which are committed by
 16 32 minors may be released in the same manner as records of
 16 33 convictions of adults. Pursuant to Code section 915.10A,
 16 34 information concerning a juvenile charged with a felony offense
 16 35 may be released pursuant to an automated victim notification
 17  1 system. Under the bill, these exemptions to confidentiality
 17  2 are not amended and therefore still apply to juvenile court
 17  3 records.
 17  4    RIGHT TO COUNSEL.  The bill in Code section 232.11 provides
 17  5 that a child has the right to be represented by counsel at a
 17  6 hearing on a confidentiality order under Code section 232.149A
 17  7 or a public records order under Code section 232.149B.
 17  8    APPLICABILITY.  The bill applies to juvenile delinquency
 17  9 proceedings which are pending or arise on or after July 1,
 17 10 2016.

 12 23 public records unless subject to a confidentiality order under
 12 24 Code section 232.149A or a sealing order under Code section

 12 26 shall not be available to the public or any governmental
 12 27 agency through the internet or in an electronic customized
 12 28 data report unless the child has been adjudicated delinquent
 12 29 in the matter.  Nevertheless, the bill provides that official
 12 30 juvenile court records may be disclosed without a court order
 12 31 through the internet or in an electronic customized data
 12 32 report prior to the child being adjudicated delinquent to the
 12 33 judge and professional court staff, including juvenile court
 12 34 officers; the child's counsel or guardian ad litem; the county
 12 35 attorney and the county attorney's assistants; a court, court
 13  1 professional staff, and adult probation officers in connection
 13  2 with the preparation of a presentence report concerning a
 13  3 person who prior thereto had been the subject of a juvenile
 13  4 court proceeding; a state or local law enforcement agency; the
 13  5 state public defender; the statistical analysis center for
 13  6 the purposes stated in Code section 216A.136; the department
 13  7 of human services; the department of corrections; a judicial
 13  8 district department of correctional services; and the board of
 13  9 parole.
 13 10    CONFIDENTIALITY OF TRANSCRIPTS.  The bill in newly
 13 11 designated Code section 232.147(3B) provides that if the court
 13 12 has excluded the public from a hearing pursuant to Code section
 13 13 232.39 or 232.92, the transcript of the proceedings shall not
 13 14 be deemed a public record and inspection and disclosure of
 13 15 the contents of the transcript shall not be permitted except
 13 16 pursuant to a court order or unless otherwise provided in Code
 13 17 chapter 232.
 13 18    USE OF ADJUDICATION OF DELINQUENCY FOR PENALTY ENHANCEMENTS
 13 19 OR EVIDENCE.  The bill in newly designated Code section
 13 20 232.147(13) provides that the confidentiality of a final
 13 21 adjudication of delinquency under Code section 232.147 or
 13 22 pursuant to Code section 232.149A shall not prohibit the state
 13 23 from pleading or proving the adjudication at a subsequent
 13 24 criminal or delinquency proceeding for the purpose of penalty
 13 25 enhancement when a provision of the Code specifically deems the
 13 26 delinquency adjudication to constitute a final conviction.
 13 27    The bill in newly designated Code section 232.147(14)
 13 28 provides that the provisions of the bill shall not be construed
 13 29 to limit or restrict the production, use, or introduction
 13 30 of official juvenile court records in any juvenile or adult
 13 31 criminal proceeding, where such records are relevant and deemed
 13 32 admissible under any other provision of the law.
 13 33    CONFIDENTIALITY OF RECORDS AND FILES OF CRIMINAL OR
 13 34 JUVENILE JUSTICE AGENCIES.  Under current law, records and
 13 35 files of a criminal or juvenile justice agency concerning
 14  1 a child involved in a delinquent act are public records,
 14  2 subject to certain exceptions. The bill in Code section
 14  3 232.149 provides that the records and files of a criminal or
 14  4 juvenile justice agency, an intake officer, or a juvenile court
 14  5 officer concerning a child involved in a delinquent act are
 14  6 confidential. The bill further provides that the records of an
 14  7 intake officer or juvenile court officer containing a dismissal
 14  8 of a complaint or an informal adjustment of a complaint when
 14  9 no petition is filed relating to the complaint, shall not be
 14 10 available to the public, but may be disclosed to the judge and
 14 11 professional court staff, including juvenile court officers;
 14 12 the child's counsel or guardian ad litem; the county attorney
 14 13 and county attorney's assistants;  the superintendent or the
 14 14 superintendent's designee of the school district for the
 14 15 school attended by the child or the authorities in charge of
 14 16 an accredited nonpublic school attended by the child; a member
 14 17 of the armed forces of the United States who is conducting a
 14 18 background investigation of an individual pursuant to federal
 14 19 law; the statistical analysis center for the purposes stated
 14 20 in Code section 216A.136; the state public defender;  the
 14 21 department of human services; and the alleged victim of the
 14 22 delinquent act.
 14 23    PUBLIC RECORDS HEARINGS.  The bill enacts new Code section
 14 24 232.149B, which provides that a person may apply for a court
 14 25 order to make confidential juvenile court records public.
 14 26 The bill provides that a rebuttable presumption exists that
 14 27 official juvenile court records shall remain confidential. The
 14 28 bill provides that the court shall order the official juvenile
 14 29 court records in such a delinquency proceeding to be public
 14 30 records if either the public's interest in making the records
 14 31 public outweighs the juvenile's interest in maintaining the
 14 32 confidentiality of the records or the juvenile has been placed
 14 33 on youthful offender status pursuant to Code section 232.45(7)
 14 34 and Code section 907.3A(1), and will be transferred back to
 14 35 the district court for sentencing prior to the child's 18th
 15  1 birthday. The court may order the official juvenile court
 15  2 records in such a delinquency proceeding to be public records
 15  3 if the juvenile has been subsequently adjudicated delinquent
 15  4 for a public offense that would be a serious misdemeanor,
 15  5 aggravated misdemeanor, or felony offense if committed by an
 15  6 adult, or another delinquency proceeding is pending seeking
 15  7 such an adjudication. The bill provides that records subject
 15  8 to a public records order may be sealed at a later date
 15  9 pursuant to Code section 232.150.
 15 10    RIGHT TO REVIEW AND RELEASE A CONFIDENTIAL COMPLAINT.  The
 15 11 bill provides that delinquency complaints shall be released
 15 12 in accordance with Code section 915.25. Under current Code
 15 13 section 915.25, a complaint which alleges that a child who is
 15 14 at least 10 years of age committed a delinquent act, which if
 15 15 committed by an adult would be a public offense, is a public
 15 16 record. Current Code section 915.25 authorizes the court,
 15 17 its designee, or law enforcement officials to release such
 15 18 a complaint, including the identity of the child. The bill
 15 19 amends Code section 915.25 to provide that such a complaint
 15 20 is confidential unless the complaint alleges that the child
 15 21 committed a delinquent act that if committed by an adult would
 15 22 be a forcible felony. However, the bill authorizes state and
 15 23 local enforcement officials to release a confidential complaint
 15 24 against a child if the child is at large and doing so is deemed
 15 25 necessary for the protection of the public or the safety of
 15 26 the child. If the complaint is not confidential because the
 15 27 alleged delinquent act is an act that would be a forcible
 15 28 felony if committed by an adult, the court, its designee,
 15 29 or law enforcement officials may release such a complaint,
 15 30 including the identity of the child.
 15 31    The bill provides that an intake or juvenile court officer
 15 32 shall disclose to the alleged victim of a delinquent act, upon
 15 33 request, the complaint, the name and address of the child who
 15 34 allegedly committed the delinquent act, and the disposition
 15 35 of the complaint. If the alleged delinquent act would be
 16  1 a forcible felony if committed by an adult, the intake or
 16  2 juvenile court officer shall provide notification to the victim
 16  3 as required by Code section 915.24.
 16  4    SEALING OF JUVENILE COURT RECORDS UNAVAILABLE FOR
 16  5 OPERATING=WHILE=INTOXICATED VIOLATIONS.  Under current Code
 16  6 section 232.150, a court shall order juvenile court records
 16  7 to be sealed if the person who is the subject of the juvenile
 16  8 court records is 18 years of age or older and 2 years have
 16  9 elapsed since the last official action in the person's case,
 16 10 the person has not been subsequently convicted of a felony
 16 11 or an aggravated or serious misdemeanor or adjudicated a
 16 12 delinquent child for an act which if committed by an adult
 16 13 would be a felony, an aggravated misdemeanor, or a serious
 16 14 misdemeanor and no proceeding is pending seeking such
 16 15 conviction or adjudication, and the person was not placed on
 16 16 youthful offender status, transferred back to district court
 16 17 after the youthful offender's 18th birthday, and sentenced for
 16 18 the offense which precipitated the youthful offender placement.
 16 19 The bill in newly designated Code section 232.150(4) provides
 16 20 that the court shall not seal a person's juvenile court records
 16 21 if the person was adjudicated delinquent for violating Code
 16 22 section 321J.2, which prohibits the operation of a motor
 16 23 vehicle while under the influence of alcohol or a drug.
 16 24    RELEASE OF CONFIDENTIAL RECORDS.  The bill provides that a
 16 25 public record which is confidential under the provisions of
 16 26 Code chapter 232 shall only be subject to release upon order of
 16 27 a court in a proceeding under Code chapter 232.
 16 28    EXISTING CONFIDENTIALITY EXEMPTIONS.  The bill retains
 16 29 certain existing exemptions to confidentiality of juvenile
 16 30 court records. Pursuant to Code section 692A.121(8), records
 16 31 concerning sex offense convictions which are committed by
 16 32 minors may be released in the same manner as records of
 16 33 convictions of adults. Pursuant to Code section 915.10A,
 16 34 information concerning a juvenile charged with a felony offense
 16 35 may be released pursuant to an automated victim notification
 17  1 system. Under the bill, these exemptions to confidentiality
 17  2 are not amended and therefore still apply to juvenile court
 17  3 records.
 17  4    RIGHT TO COUNSEL.  The bill in Code section 232.11 provides
 17  5 that a child has the right to be represented by counsel at a
 17  6 hearing on a confidentiality order under Code section 232.149A
 17  7 or a public records order under Code section 232.149B.
 17  8    APPLICABILITY.  The bill applies to juvenile delinquency
 17  9 proceedings which are pending or arise on or after July 1,
 17 10 2016.

 12 24 Code section 232.149A or a sealing order under Code section
 12 25 232.150.  However, the bill provides that such official records
 12 26 shall not be available to the public or any governmental
 12 27 agency through the internet or in an electronic customized
 12 28 data report unless the child has been adjudicated delinquent
 12 29 in the matter.  Nevertheless, the bill provides that official
 12 30 juvenile court records may be disclosed without a court order
 12 31 through the internet or in an electronic customized data
 12 32 report prior to the child being adjudicated delinquent to the
 12 33 judge and professional court staff, including juvenile court
 12 34 officers; the child's counsel or guardian ad litem; the county
 12 35 attorney and the county attorney's assistants; a court, court
 13  1 professional staff, and adult probation officers in connection
 13  2 with the preparation of a presentence report concerning a
 13  3 person who prior thereto had been the subject of a juvenile
 13  4 court proceeding; a state or local law enforcement agency; the
 13  5 state public defender; the statistical analysis center for
 13  6 the purposes stated in Code section 216A.136; the department
 13  7 of human services; the department of corrections; a judicial
 13  8 district department of correctional services; and the board of
 13  9 parole.
 13 10    CONFIDENTIALITY OF TRANSCRIPTS.  The bill in newly
 13 11 designated Code section 232.147(3B) provides that if the court
 13 12 has excluded the public from a hearing pursuant to Code section
 13 13 232.39 or 232.92, the transcript of the proceedings shall not
 13 14 be deemed a public record and inspection and disclosure of
 13 15 the contents of the transcript shall not be permitted except
 13 16 pursuant to a court order or unless otherwise provided in Code
 13 17 chapter 232.
 13 18    USE OF ADJUDICATION OF DELINQUENCY FOR PENALTY ENHANCEMENTS
 13 19 OR EVIDENCE.  The bill in newly designated Code section
 13 20 232.147(13) provides that the confidentiality of a final
 13 21 adjudication of delinquency under Code section 232.147 or
 13 22 pursuant to Code section 232.149A shall not prohibit the state
 13 23 from pleading or proving the adjudication at a subsequent
 13 24 criminal or delinquency proceeding for the purpose of penalty
 13 25 enhancement when a provision of the Code specifically deems the
 13 26 delinquency adjudication to constitute a final conviction.
 13 27    The bill in newly designated Code section 232.147(14)
 13 28 provides that the provisions of the bill shall not be construed
 13 29 to limit or restrict the production, use, or introduction
 13 30 of official juvenile court records in any juvenile or adult
 13 31 criminal proceeding, where such records are relevant and deemed
 13 32 admissible under any other provision of the law.
 13 33    CONFIDENTIALITY OF RECORDS AND FILES OF CRIMINAL OR
 13 34 JUVENILE JUSTICE AGENCIES.  Under current law, records and
 13 35 files of a criminal or juvenile justice agency concerning
 14  1 a child involved in a delinquent act are public records,
 14  2 subject to certain exceptions. The bill in Code section
 14  3 232.149 provides that the records and files of a criminal or
 14  4 juvenile justice agency, an intake officer, or a juvenile court
 14  5 officer concerning a child involved in a delinquent act are
 14  6 confidential. The bill further provides that the records of an
 14  7 intake officer or juvenile court officer containing a dismissal
 14  8 of a complaint or an informal adjustment of a complaint when
 14  9 no petition is filed relating to the complaint, shall not be
 14 10 available to the public, but may be disclosed to the judge and
 14 11 professional court staff, including juvenile court officers;
 14 12 the child's counsel or guardian ad litem; the county attorney
 14 13 and county attorney's assistants;  the superintendent or the
 14 14 superintendent's designee of the school district for the
 14 15 school attended by the child or the authorities in charge of
 14 16 an accredited nonpublic school attended by the child; a member
 14 17 of the armed forces of the United States who is conducting a
 14 18 background investigation of an individual pursuant to federal
 14 19 law; the statistical analysis center for the purposes stated
 14 20 in Code section 216A.136; the state public defender;  the
 14 21 department of human services; and the alleged victim of the
 14 22 delinquent act.
 14 23    PUBLIC RECORDS HEARINGS.  The bill enacts new Code section
 14 24 232.149B, which provides that a person may apply for a court
 14 25 order to make confidential juvenile court records public.
 14 26 The bill provides that a rebuttable presumption exists that
 14 27 official juvenile court records shall remain confidential. The
 14 28 bill provides that the court shall order the official juvenile
 14 29 court records in such a delinquency proceeding to be public
 14 30 records if either the public's interest in making the records
 14 31 public outweighs the juvenile's interest in maintaining the
 14 32 confidentiality of the records or the juvenile has been placed
 14 33 on youthful offender status pursuant to Code section 232.45(7)
 14 34 and Code section 907.3A(1), and will be transferred back to
 14 35 the district court for sentencing prior to the child's 18th
 15  1 birthday. The court may order the official juvenile court
 15  2 records in such a delinquency proceeding to be public records
 15  3 if the juvenile has been subsequently adjudicated delinquent
 15  4 for a public offense that would be a serious misdemeanor,
 15  5 aggravated misdemeanor, or felony offense if committed by an
 15  6 adult, or another delinquency proceeding is pending seeking
 15  7 such an adjudication. The bill provides that records subject
 15  8 to a public records order may be sealed at a later date
 15  9 pursuant to Code section 232.150.
 15 10    RIGHT TO REVIEW AND RELEASE A CONFIDENTIAL COMPLAINT.  The
 15 11 bill provides that delinquency complaints shall be released
 15 12 in accordance with Code section 915.25. Under current Code
 15 13 section 915.25, a complaint which alleges that a child who is
 15 14 at least 10 years of age committed a delinquent act, which if
 15 15 committed by an adult would be a public offense, is a public
 15 16 record. Current Code section 915.25 authorizes the court,
 15 17 its designee, or law enforcement officials to release such
 15 18 a complaint, including the identity of the child. The bill
 15 19 amends Code section 915.25 to provide that such a complaint
 15 20 is confidential unless the complaint alleges that the child
 15 21 committed a delinquent act that if committed by an adult would
 15 22 be a forcible felony. However, the bill authorizes state and
 15 23 local enforcement officials to release a confidential complaint
 15 24 against a child if the child is at large and doing so is deemed
 15 25 necessary for the protection of the public or the safety of
 15 26 the child. If the complaint is not confidential because the
 15 27 alleged delinquent act is an act that would be a forcible
 15 28 felony if committed by an adult, the court, its designee,
 15 29 or law enforcement officials may release such a complaint,
 15 30 including the identity of the child.
 15 31    The bill provides that an intake or juvenile court officer
 15 32 shall disclose to the alleged victim of a delinquent act, upon
 15 33 request, the complaint, the name and address of the child who
 15 34 allegedly committed the delinquent act, and the disposition
 15 35 of the complaint. If the alleged delinquent act would be
 16  1 a forcible felony if committed by an adult, the intake or
 16  2 juvenile court officer shall provide notification to the victim
 16  3 as required by Code section 915.24.
 16  4    SEALING OF JUVENILE COURT RECORDS UNAVAILABLE FOR
 16  5 OPERATING=WHILE=INTOXICATED VIOLATIONS.  Under current Code
 16  6 section 232.150, a court shall order juvenile court records
 16  7 to be sealed if the person who is the subject of the juvenile
 16  8 court records is 18 years of age or older and 2 years have
 16  9 elapsed since the last official action in the person's case,
 16 10 the person has not been subsequently convicted of a felony
 16 11 or an aggravated or serious misdemeanor or adjudicated a
 16 12 delinquent child for an act which if committed by an adult
 16 13 would be a felony, an aggravated misdemeanor, or a serious
 16 14 misdemeanor and no proceeding is pending seeking such
 16 15 conviction or adjudication, and the person was not placed on
 16 16 youthful offender status, transferred back to district court
 16 17 after the youthful offender's 18th birthday, and sentenced for
 16 18 the offense which precipitated the youthful offender placement.
 16 19 The bill in newly designated Code section 232.150(4) provides
 16 20 that the court shall not seal a person's juvenile court records
 16 21 if the person was adjudicated delinquent for violating Code
 16 22 section 321J.2, which prohibits the operation of a motor
 16 23 vehicle while under the influence of alcohol or a drug.
 16 24    RELEASE OF CONFIDENTIAL RECORDS.  The bill provides that a
 16 25 public record which is confidential under the provisions of
 16 26 Code chapter 232 shall only be subject to release upon order of
 16 27 a court in a proceeding under Code chapter 232.
 16 28    EXISTING CONFIDENTIALITY EXEMPTIONS.  The bill retains
 16 29 certain existing exemptions to confidentiality of juvenile
 16 30 court records. Pursuant to Code section 692A.121(8), records
 16 31 concerning sex offense convictions which are committed by
 16 32 minors may be released in the same manner as records of
 16 33 convictions of adults. Pursuant to Code section 915.10A,
 16 34 information concerning a juvenile charged with a felony offense
 16 35 may be released pursuant to an automated victim notification
 17  1 system. Under the bill, these exemptions to confidentiality
 17  2 are not amended and therefore still apply to juvenile court
 17  3 records.
 17  4    RIGHT TO COUNSEL.  The bill in Code section 232.11 provides
 17  5 that a child has the right to be represented by counsel at a
 17  6 hearing on a confidentiality order under Code section 232.149A
 17  7 or a public records order under Code section 232.149B.
 17  8    APPLICABILITY.  The bill applies to juvenile delinquency
 17  9 proceedings which are pending or arise on or after July 1,
 17 10 2016.

 12 27 agency through the internet or in an electronic customized
 12 28 data report unless the child has been adjudicated delinquent
 12 29 in the matter.  Nevertheless, the bill provides that official
 12 30 juvenile court records may be disclosed without a court order
 12 31 through the internet or in an electronic customized data
 12 32 report prior to the child being adjudicated delinquent to the
 12 33 judge and professional court staff, including juvenile court

 13 10    CONFIDENTIALITY OF TRANSCRIPTS.  The bill in newly
 13 11 designated Code section 232.147(3B) provides that if the court
 13 12 has excluded the public from a hearing pursuant to Code section
 13 13 232.39 or 232.92, the transcript of the proceedings shall not
 13 14 be deemed a public record and inspection and disclosure of
 13 15 the contents of the transcript shall not be permitted except
 13 16 pursuant to a court order or unless otherwise provided in Code
 13 17 chapter 232.
 13 18    USE OF ADJUDICATION OF DELINQUENCY FOR PENALTY ENHANCEMENTS
 13 19 OR EVIDENCE.  The bill in newly designated Code section
 13 20 232.147(13) provides that the confidentiality of a final
 13 21 adjudication of delinquency under Code section 232.147 or
 13 22 pursuant to Code section 232.149A shall not prohibit the state
 13 23 from pleading or proving the adjudication at a subsequent
 13 24 criminal or delinquency proceeding for the purpose of penalty
 13 25 enhancement when a provision of the Code specifically deems the
 13 26 delinquency adjudication to constitute a final conviction.
 13 27    The bill in newly designated Code section 232.147(14)
 13 28 provides that the provisions of the bill shall not be construed
 13 29 to limit or restrict the production, use, or introduction
 13 30 of official juvenile court records in any juvenile or adult
 13 31 criminal proceeding, where such records are relevant and deemed
 13 32 admissible under any other provision of the law.
 13 33    CONFIDENTIALITY OF RECORDS AND FILES OF CRIMINAL OR
 13 34 JUVENILE JUSTICE AGENCIES.  Under current law, records and
 13 35 files of a criminal or juvenile justice agency concerning
 14  1 a child involved in a delinquent act are public records,
 14  2 subject to certain exceptions. The bill in Code section
 14  3 232.149 provides that the records and files of a criminal or
 14  4 juvenile justice agency, an intake officer, or a juvenile court
 14  5 officer concerning a child involved in a delinquent act are
 14  6 confidential. The bill further provides that the records of an
 14  7 intake officer or juvenile court officer containing a dismissal
 14  8 of a complaint or an informal adjustment of a complaint when
 14  9 no petition is filed relating to the complaint, shall not be
 14 10 available to the public, but may be disclosed to the judge and
 14 11 professional court staff, including juvenile court officers;
 14 12 the child's counsel or guardian ad litem; the county attorney
 14 13 and county attorney's assistants;  the superintendent or the

 14 16 an accredited nonpublic school attended by the child; a member
 14 17 of the armed forces of the United States who is conducting a

 14 19 law; the statistical analysis center for the purposes stated
 14 20 in Code section 216A.136; the state public defender;  the
 14 21 department of human services; and the alleged victim of the
 14 22 delinquent act.
 14 23    PUBLIC RECORDS HEARINGS.  The bill enacts new Code section
 14 24 232.149B, which provides that a person may apply for a court
 14 25 order to make confidential juvenile court records public.
 14 26 The bill provides that a rebuttable presumption exists that
 14 27 official juvenile court records shall remain confidential. The
 14 28 bill provides that the court shall order the official juvenile
 14 29 court records in such a delinquency proceeding to be public
 14 30 records if either the public's interest in making the records
 14 31 public outweighs the juvenile's interest in maintaining the
 14 32 confidentiality of the records or the juvenile has been placed
 14 33 on youthful offender status pursuant to Code section 232.45(7)
 14 34 and Code section 907.3A(1), and will be transferred back to
 14 35 the district court for sentencing prior to the child's 18th
 15  1 birthday. The court may order the official juvenile court
 15  2 records in such a delinquency proceeding to be public records
 15  3 if the juvenile has been subsequently adjudicated delinquent
 15  4 for a public offense that would be a serious misdemeanor,
 15  5 aggravated misdemeanor, or felony offense if committed by an
 15  6 adult, or another delinquency proceeding is pending seeking
 15  7 such an adjudication. The bill provides that records subject
 15  8 to a public records order may be sealed at a later date
 15  9 pursuant to Code section 232.150.
 15 10    RIGHT TO REVIEW AND RELEASE A CONFIDENTIAL COMPLAINT.  The
 15 11 bill provides that delinquency complaints shall be released
 15 12 in accordance with Code section 915.25. Under current Code
 15 13 section 915.25, a complaint which alleges that a child who is
 15 14 at least 10 years of age committed a delinquent act, which if
 15 15 committed by an adult would be a public offense, is a public
 15 16 record. Current Code section 915.25 authorizes the court,
 15 17 its designee, or law enforcement officials to release such
 15 18 a complaint, including the identity of the child. The bill
 15 19 amends Code section 915.25 to provide that such a complaint
 15 20 is confidential unless the complaint alleges that the child
 15 21 committed a delinquent act that if committed by an adult would
 15 22 be a forcible felony. However, the bill authorizes state and
 15 23 local enforcement officials to release a confidential complaint
 15 24 against a child if the child is at large and doing so is deemed
 15 25 necessary for the protection of the public or the safety of
 15 26 the child. If the complaint is not confidential because the
 15 27 alleged delinquent act is an act that would be a forcible
 15 28 felony if committed by an adult, the court, its designee,
 15 29 or law enforcement officials may release such a complaint,
 15 30 including the identity of the child.
 15 31    The bill provides that an intake or juvenile court officer
 15 32 shall disclose to the alleged victim of a delinquent act, upon
 15 33 request, the complaint, the name and address of the child who
 15 34 allegedly committed the delinquent act, and the disposition
 15 35 of the complaint. If the alleged delinquent act would be
 16  1 a forcible felony if committed by an adult, the intake or
 16  2 juvenile court officer shall provide notification to the victim
 16  3 as required by Code section 915.24.
 16  4    SEALING OF JUVENILE COURT RECORDS UNAVAILABLE FOR
 16  5 OPERATING=WHILE=INTOXICATED VIOLATIONS.  Under current Code
 16  6 section 232.150, a court shall order juvenile court records
 16  7 to be sealed if the person who is the subject of the juvenile
 16  8 court records is 18 years of age or older and 2 years have
 16  9 elapsed since the last official action in the person's case,
 16 10 the person has not been subsequently convicted of a felony
 16 11 or an aggravated or serious misdemeanor or adjudicated a
 16 12 delinquent child for an act which if committed by an adult
 16 13 would be a felony, an aggravated misdemeanor, or a serious
 16 14 misdemeanor and no proceeding is pending seeking such
 16 15 conviction or adjudication, and the person was not placed on
 16 16 youthful offender status, transferred back to district court
 16 17 after the youthful offender's 18th birthday, and sentenced for
 16 18 the offense which precipitated the youthful offender placement.
 16 19 The bill in newly designated Code section 232.150(4) provides
 16 20 that the court shall not seal a person's juvenile court records
 16 21 if the person was adjudicated delinquent for violating Code
 16 22 section 321J.2, which prohibits the operation of a motor
 16 23 vehicle while under the influence of alcohol or a drug.
 16 24    RELEASE OF CONFIDENTIAL RECORDS.  The bill provides that a
 16 25 public record which is confidential under the provisions of
 16 26 Code chapter 232 shall only be subject to release upon order of
 16 27 a court in a proceeding under Code chapter 232.
 16 28    EXISTING CONFIDENTIALITY EXEMPTIONS.  The bill retains
 16 29 certain existing exemptions to confidentiality of juvenile
 16 30 court records. Pursuant to Code section 692A.121(8), records
 16 31 concerning sex offense convictions which are committed by
 16 32 minors may be released in the same manner as records of
 16 33 convictions of adults. Pursuant to Code section 915.10A,
 16 34 information concerning a juvenile charged with a felony offense
 16 35 may be released pursuant to an automated victim notification
 17  1 system. Under the bill, these exemptions to confidentiality
 17  2 are not amended and therefore still apply to juvenile court
 17  3 records.
 17  4    RIGHT TO COUNSEL.  The bill in Code section 232.11 provides
 17  5 that a child has the right to be represented by counsel at a
 17  6 hearing on a confidentiality order under Code section 232.149A
 17  7 or a public records order under Code section 232.149B.
 17  8    APPLICABILITY.  The bill applies to juvenile delinquency
 17  9 proceedings which are pending or arise on or after July 1,

 12 27 agency through the internet or in an electronic customized
 12 28 data report unless the child has been adjudicated delinquent
 12 29 in the matter.  Nevertheless, the bill provides that official
 12 30 juvenile court records may be disclosed without a court order
 12 31 through the internet or in an electronic customized data
 12 32 report prior to the child being adjudicated delinquent to the
 12 33 judge and professional court staff, including juvenile court
 12 34 officers; the child's counsel or guardian ad litem; the county
 12 35 attorney and the county attorney's assistants; a court, court
 13  1 professional staff, and adult probation officers in connection
 13  2 with the preparation of a presentence report concerning a
 13  3 person who prior thereto had been the subject of a juvenile
 13  4 court proceeding; a state or local law enforcement agency; the
 13  5 state public defender; the statistical analysis center for
 13  6 the purposes stated in Code section 216A.136; the department
 13  7 of human services; the department of corrections; a judicial
 13  8 district department of correctional services; and the board of
 13  9 parole.
 13 10    CONFIDENTIALITY OF TRANSCRIPTS.  The bill in newly
 13 11 designated Code section 232.147(3B) provides that if the court
 13 12 has excluded the public from a hearing pursuant to Code section
 13 13 232.39 or 232.92, the transcript of the proceedings shall not
 13 14 be deemed a public record and inspection and disclosure of
 13 15 the contents of the transcript shall not be permitted except
 13 16 pursuant to a court order or unless otherwise provided in Code
 13 17 chapter 232.
 13 18    USE OF ADJUDICATION OF DELINQUENCY FOR PENALTY ENHANCEMENTS
 13 19 OR EVIDENCE.  The bill in newly designated Code section
 13 20 232.147(13) provides that the confidentiality of a final
 13 21 adjudication of delinquency under Code section 232.147 or
 13 22 pursuant to Code section 232.149A shall not prohibit the state
 13 23 from pleading or proving the adjudication at a subsequent
 13 24 criminal or delinquency proceeding for the purpose of penalty
 13 25 enhancement when a provision of the Code specifically deems the
 13 26 delinquency adjudication to constitute a final conviction.
 13 27    The bill in newly designated Code section 232.147(14)
 13 28 provides that the provisions of the bill shall not be construed
 13 29 to limit or restrict the production, use, or introduction
 13 30 of official juvenile court records in any juvenile or adult
 13 31 criminal proceeding, where such records are relevant and deemed
 13 32 admissible under any other provision of the law.
 13 33    CONFIDENTIALITY OF RECORDS AND FILES OF CRIMINAL OR
 13 34 JUVENILE JUSTICE AGENCIES.  Under current law, records and
 13 35 files of a criminal or juvenile justice agency concerning
 14  1 a child involved in a delinquent act are public records,
 14  2 subject to certain exceptions. The bill in Code section
 14  3 232.149 provides that the records and files of a criminal or
 14  4 juvenile justice agency, an intake officer, or a juvenile court
 14  5 officer concerning a child involved in a delinquent act are
 14  6 confidential. The bill further provides that the records of an
 14  7 intake officer or juvenile court officer containing a dismissal
 14  8 of a complaint or an informal adjustment of a complaint when
 14  9 no petition is filed relating to the complaint, shall not be
 14 10 available to the public, but may be disclosed to the judge and
 14 11 professional court staff, including juvenile court officers;
 14 12 the child's counsel or guardian ad litem; the county attorney
 14 13 and county attorney's assistants;  the superintendent or the
 14 14 superintendent's designee of the school district for the
 14 15 school attended by the child or the authorities in charge of
 14 16 an accredited nonpublic school attended by the child; a member
 14 17 of the armed forces of the United States who is conducting a
 14 18 background investigation of an individual pursuant to federal
 14 19 law; the statistical analysis center for the purposes stated
 14 20 in Code section 216A.136; the state public defender;  the
 14 21 department of human services; and the alleged victim of the
 14 22 delinquent act.
 14 23    PUBLIC RECORDS HEARINGS.  The bill enacts new Code section
 14 24 232.149B, which provides that a person may apply for a court
 14 25 order to make confidential juvenile court records public.
 14 26 The bill provides that a rebuttable presumption exists that
 14 27 official juvenile court records shall remain confidential. The
 14 28 bill provides that the court shall order the official juvenile
 14 29 court records in such a delinquency proceeding to be public
 14 30 records if either the public's interest in making the records
 14 31 public outweighs the juvenile's interest in maintaining the
 14 32 confidentiality of the records or the juvenile has been placed
 14 33 on youthful offender status pursuant to Code section 232.45(7)
 14 34 and Code section 907.3A(1), and will be transferred back to
 14 35 the district court for sentencing prior to the child's 18th
 15  1 birthday. The court may order the official juvenile court
 15  2 records in such a delinquency proceeding to be public records
 15  3 if the juvenile has been subsequently adjudicated delinquent
 15  4 for a public offense that would be a serious misdemeanor,
 15  5 aggravated misdemeanor, or felony offense if committed by an
 15  6 adult, or another delinquency proceeding is pending seeking
 15  7 such an adjudication. The bill provides that records subject
 15  8 to a public records order may be sealed at a later date
 15  9 pursuant to Code section 232.150.
 15 10    RIGHT TO REVIEW AND RELEASE A CONFIDENTIAL COMPLAINT.  The
 15 11 bill provides that delinquency complaints shall be released
 15 12 in accordance with Code section 915.25. Under current Code
 15 13 section 915.25, a complaint which alleges that a child who is
 15 14 at least 10 years of age committed a delinquent act, which if
 15 15 committed by an adult would be a public offense, is a public
 15 16 record. Current Code section 915.25 authorizes the court,
 15 17 its designee, or law enforcement officials to release such
 15 18 a complaint, including the identity of the child. The bill
 15 19 amends Code section 915.25 to provide that such a complaint
 15 20 is confidential unless the complaint alleges that the child
 15 21 committed a delinquent act that if committed by an adult would
 15 22 be a forcible felony. However, the bill authorizes state and
 15 23 local enforcement officials to release a confidential complaint
 15 24 against a child if the child is at large and doing so is deemed
 15 25 necessary for the protection of the public or the safety of
 15 26 the child. If the complaint is not confidential because the
 15 27 alleged delinquent act is an act that would be a forcible
 15 28 felony if committed by an adult, the court, its designee,
 15 29 or law enforcement officials may release such a complaint,
 15 30 including the identity of the child.
 15 31    The bill provides that an intake or juvenile court officer
 15 32 shall disclose to the alleged victim of a delinquent act, upon
 15 33 request, the complaint, the name and address of the child who
 15 34 allegedly committed the delinquent act, and the disposition
 15 35 of the complaint. If the alleged delinquent act would be
 16  1 a forcible felony if committed by an adult, the intake or
 16  2 juvenile court officer shall provide notification to the victim
 16  3 as required by Code section 915.24.
 16  4    SEALING OF JUVENILE COURT RECORDS UNAVAILABLE FOR
 16  5 OPERATING=WHILE=INTOXICATED VIOLATIONS.  Under current Code
 16  6 section 232.150, a court shall order juvenile court records
 16  7 to be sealed if the person who is the subject of the juvenile
 16  8 court records is 18 years of age or older and 2 years have
 16  9 elapsed since the last official action in the person's case,
 16 10 the person has not been subsequently convicted of a felony
 16 11 or an aggravated or serious misdemeanor or adjudicated a
 16 12 delinquent child for an act which if committed by an adult
 16 13 would be a felony, an aggravated misdemeanor, or a serious
 16 14 misdemeanor and no proceeding is pending seeking such
 16 15 conviction or adjudication, and the person was not placed on
 16 16 youthful offender status, transferred back to district court
 16 17 after the youthful offender's 18th birthday, and sentenced for
 16 18 the offense which precipitated the youthful offender placement.
 16 19 The bill in newly designated Code section 232.150(4) provides
 16 20 that the court shall not seal a person's juvenile court records
 16 21 if the person was adjudicated delinquent for violating Code
 16 22 section 321J.2, which prohibits the operation of a motor
 16 23 vehicle while under the influence of alcohol or a drug.
 16 24    RELEASE OF CONFIDENTIAL RECORDS.  The bill provides that a
 16 25 public record which is confidential under the provisions of
 16 26 Code chapter 232 shall only be subject to release upon order of
 16 27 a court in a proceeding under Code chapter 232.
 16 28    EXISTING CONFIDENTIALITY EXEMPTIONS.  The bill retains
 16 29 certain existing exemptions to confidentiality of juvenile
 16 30 court records. Pursuant to Code section 692A.121(8), records
 16 31 concerning sex offense convictions which are committed by
 16 32 minors may be released in the same manner as records of
 16 33 convictions of adults. Pursuant to Code section 915.10A,
 16 34 information concerning a juvenile charged with a felony offense
 16 35 may be released pursuant to an automated victim notification
 17  1 system. Under the bill, these exemptions to confidentiality
 17  2 are not amended and therefore still apply to juvenile court
 17  3 records.
 17  4    RIGHT TO COUNSEL.  The bill in Code section 232.11 provides
 17  5 that a child has the right to be represented by counsel at a

 17  7 or a public records order under Code section 232.149B.

 13 18    USE OF ADJUDICATION OF DELINQUENCY FOR PENALTY ENHANCEMENTS
 13 19 OR EVIDENCE.  The bill in newly designated Code section
 13 20 232.147(13) provides that the confidentiality of a final
 13 21 adjudication of delinquency under Code section 232.147 or
 13 22 pursuant to Code section 232.149A shall not prohibit the state
 13 23 from pleading or proving the adjudication at a subsequent

 14  7 intake officer or juvenile court officer containing a dismissal
 14  8 of a complaint or an informal adjustment of a complaint when
 14  9 no petition is filed relating to the complaint, shall not be

 14 25 order to make confidential juvenile court records public.
 14 26 The bill provides that a rebuttable presumption exists that

 15  4 for a public offense that would be a serious misdemeanor,

 15 10    RIGHT TO REVIEW AND RELEASE A CONFIDENTIAL COMPLAINT.  The

 15 20 is confidential unless the complaint alleges that the child
 15 21 committed a delinquent act that if committed by an adult would

 16  3 as required by Code section 915.24.
 16  4    SEALING OF JUVENILE COURT RECORDS UNAVAILABLE FOR
 16  5 OPERATING=WHILE=INTOXICATED VIOLATIONS.  Under current Code
 16  6 section 232.150, a court shall order juvenile court records
 16  7 to be sealed if the person who is the subject of the juvenile
 16  8 court records is 18 years of age or older and 2 years have
 16  9 elapsed since the last official action in the person's case,
 16 10 the person has not been subsequently convicted of a felony

 12 34 officers; the child's counsel or guardian ad litem; the county
 12 35 attorney and the county attorney's assistants; a court, court
 13  1 professional staff, and adult probation officers in connection
 13  2 with the preparation of a presentence report concerning a
 13  3 person who prior thereto had been the subject of a juvenile
 13  4 court proceeding; a state or local law enforcement agency; the
 13  5 state public defender; the statistical analysis center for
 13  6 the purposes stated in Code section 216A.136; the department
 13  7 of human services; the department of corrections; a judicial
 13  8 district department of correctional services; and the board of
 13  9 parole.
 13 10    CONFIDENTIALITY OF TRANSCRIPTS.  The bill in newly
 13 11 designated Code section 232.147(3B) provides that if the court
 13 12 has excluded the public from a hearing pursuant to Code section
 13 13 232.39 or 232.92, the transcript of the proceedings shall not
 13 14 be deemed a public record and inspection and disclosure of
 13 15 the contents of the transcript shall not be permitted except
 13 16 pursuant to a court order or unless otherwise provided in Code
 13 17 chapter 232.
 13 18    USE OF ADJUDICATION OF DELINQUENCY FOR PENALTY ENHANCEMENTS
 13 19 OR EVIDENCE.  The bill in newly designated Code section
 13 20 232.147(13) provides that the confidentiality of a final
 13 21 adjudication of delinquency under Code section 232.147 or
 13 22 pursuant to Code section 232.149A shall not prohibit the state
 13 23 from pleading or proving the adjudication at a subsequent
 13 24 criminal or delinquency proceeding for the purpose of penalty
 13 25 enhancement when a provision of the Code specifically deems the
 13 26 delinquency adjudication to constitute a final conviction.
 13 27    The bill in newly designated Code section 232.147(14)
 13 28 provides that the provisions of the bill shall not be construed
 13 29 to limit or restrict the production, use, or introduction
 13 30 of official juvenile court records in any juvenile or adult
 13 31 criminal proceeding, where such records are relevant and deemed
 13 32 admissible under any other provision of the law.
 13 33    CONFIDENTIALITY OF RECORDS AND FILES OF CRIMINAL OR
 13 34 JUVENILE JUSTICE AGENCIES.  Under current law, records and
 13 35 files of a criminal or juvenile justice agency concerning
 14  1 a child involved in a delinquent act are public records,
 14  2 subject to certain exceptions. The bill in Code section
 14  3 232.149 provides that the records and files of a criminal or
 14  4 juvenile justice agency, an intake officer, or a juvenile court
 14  5 officer concerning a child involved in a delinquent act are
 14  6 confidential. The bill further provides that the records of an
 14  7 intake officer or juvenile court officer containing a dismissal
 14  8 of a complaint or an informal adjustment of a complaint when
 14  9 no petition is filed relating to the complaint, shall not be
 14 10 available to the public, but may be disclosed to the judge and
 14 11 professional court staff, including juvenile court officers;
 14 12 the child's counsel or guardian ad litem; the county attorney
 14 13 and county attorney's assistants;  the superintendent or the
 14 14 superintendent's designee of the school district for the
 14 15 school attended by the child or the authorities in charge of
 14 16 an accredited nonpublic school attended by the child; a member
 14 17 of the armed forces of the United States who is conducting a
 14 18 background investigation of an individual pursuant to federal
 14 19 law; the statistical analysis center for the purposes stated
 14 20 in Code section 216A.136; the state public defender;  the
 14 21 department of human services; and the alleged victim of the
 14 22 delinquent act.
 14 23    PUBLIC RECORDS HEARINGS.  The bill enacts new Code section
 14 24 232.149B, which provides that a person may apply for a court
 14 25 order to make confidential juvenile court records public.
 14 26 The bill provides that a rebuttable presumption exists that
 14 27 official juvenile court records shall remain confidential. The
 14 28 bill provides that the court shall order the official juvenile
 14 29 court records in such a delinquency proceeding to be public
 14 30 records if either the public's interest in making the records
 14 31 public outweighs the juvenile's interest in maintaining the
 14 32 confidentiality of the records or the juvenile has been placed
 14 33 on youthful offender status pursuant to Code section 232.45(7)
 14 34 and Code section 907.3A(1), and will be transferred back to
 14 35 the district court for sentencing prior to the child's 18th
 15  1 birthday. The court may order the official juvenile court
 15  2 records in such a delinquency proceeding to be public records
 15  3 if the juvenile has been subsequently adjudicated delinquent
 15  4 for a public offense that would be a serious misdemeanor,
 15  5 aggravated misdemeanor, or felony offense if committed by an
 15  6 adult, or another delinquency proceeding is pending seeking
 15  7 such an adjudication. The bill provides that records subject
 15  8 to a public records order may be sealed at a later date
 15  9 pursuant to Code section 232.150.
 15 10    RIGHT TO REVIEW AND RELEASE A CONFIDENTIAL COMPLAINT.  The
 15 11 bill provides that delinquency complaints shall be released
 15 12 in accordance with Code section 915.25. Under current Code
 15 13 section 915.25, a complaint which alleges that a child who is
 15 14 at least 10 years of age committed a delinquent act, which if
 15 15 committed by an adult would be a public offense, is a public
 15 16 record. Current Code section 915.25 authorizes the court,
 15 17 its designee, or law enforcement officials to release such
 15 18 a complaint, including the identity of the child. The bill
 15 19 amends Code section 915.25 to provide that such a complaint
 15 20 is confidential unless the complaint alleges that the child
 15 21 committed a delinquent act that if committed by an adult would
 15 22 be a forcible felony. However, the bill authorizes state and
 15 23 local enforcement officials to release a confidential complaint
 15 24 against a child if the child is at large and doing so is deemed
 15 25 necessary for the protection of the public or the safety of
 15 26 the child. If the complaint is not confidential because the
 15 27 alleged delinquent act is an act that would be a forcible
 15 28 felony if committed by an adult, the court, its designee,
 15 29 or law enforcement officials may release such a complaint,
 15 30 including the identity of the child.
 15 31    The bill provides that an intake or juvenile court officer
 15 32 shall disclose to the alleged victim of a delinquent act, upon
 15 33 request, the complaint, the name and address of the child who
 15 34 allegedly committed the delinquent act, and the disposition
 15 35 of the complaint. If the alleged delinquent act would be
 16  1 a forcible felony if committed by an adult, the intake or
 16  2 juvenile court officer shall provide notification to the victim
 16  3 as required by Code section 915.24.
 16  4    SEALING OF JUVENILE COURT RECORDS UNAVAILABLE FOR
 16  5 OPERATING=WHILE=INTOXICATED VIOLATIONS.  Under current Code
 16  6 section 232.150, a court shall order juvenile court records
 16  7 to be sealed if the person who is the subject of the juvenile
 16  8 court records is 18 years of age or older and 2 years have
 16  9 elapsed since the last official action in the person's case,
 16 10 the person has not been subsequently convicted of a felony
 16 11 or an aggravated or serious misdemeanor or adjudicated a
 16 12 delinquent child for an act which if committed by an adult
 16 13 would be a felony, an aggravated misdemeanor, or a serious
 16 14 misdemeanor and no proceeding is pending seeking such
 16 15 conviction or adjudication, and the person was not placed on
 16 16 youthful offender status, transferred back to district court
 16 17 after the youthful offender's 18th birthday, and sentenced for
 16 18 the offense which precipitated the youthful offender placement.
 16 19 The bill in newly designated Code section 232.150(4) provides
 16 20 that the court shall not seal a person's juvenile court records
 16 21 if the person was adjudicated delinquent for violating Code
 16 22 section 321J.2, which prohibits the operation of a motor
 16 23 vehicle while under the influence of alcohol or a drug.
 16 24    RELEASE OF CONFIDENTIAL RECORDS.  The bill provides that a
 16 25 public record which is confidential under the provisions of
 16 26 Code chapter 232 shall only be subject to release upon order of
 16 27 a court in a proceeding under Code chapter 232.
 16 28    EXISTING CONFIDENTIALITY EXEMPTIONS.  The bill retains
 16 29 certain existing exemptions to confidentiality of juvenile
 16 30 court records. Pursuant to Code section 692A.121(8), records
 16 31 concerning sex offense convictions which are committed by
 16 32 minors may be released in the same manner as records of
 16 33 convictions of adults. Pursuant to Code section 915.10A,
 16 34 information concerning a juvenile charged with a felony offense
 16 35 may be released pursuant to an automated victim notification
 17  1 system. Under the bill, these exemptions to confidentiality
 17  2 are not amended and therefore still apply to juvenile court
 17  3 records.
 17  4    RIGHT TO COUNSEL.  The bill in Code section 232.11 provides
 17  5 that a child has the right to be represented by counsel at a
 17  6 hearing on a confidentiality order under Code section 232.149A
 17  7 or a public records order under Code section 232.149B.
 17  8    APPLICABILITY.  The bill applies to juvenile delinquency
 17  9 proceedings which are pending or arise on or after July 1,
 17 10 2016.

 12 29 in the matter.  Nevertheless, the bill provides that official
 12 30 juvenile court records may be disclosed without a court order
 12 31 through the internet or in an electronic customized data
 12 32 report prior to the child being adjudicated delinquent to the
 12 33 judge and professional court staff, including juvenile court
 12 34 officers; the child's counsel or guardian ad litem; the county
 12 35 attorney and the county attorney's assistants; a court, court
 13  1 professional staff, and adult probation officers in connection
 13  2 with the preparation of a presentence report concerning a
 13  3 person who prior thereto had been the subject of a juvenile
 13  4 court proceeding; a state or local law enforcement agency; the
 13  5 state public defender; the statistical analysis center for
 13  6 the purposes stated in Code section 216A.136; the department
 13  7 of human services; the department of corrections; a judicial
 13  8 district department of correctional services; and the board of
 13  9 parole.
 13 10    CONFIDENTIALITY OF TRANSCRIPTS.  The bill in newly
 13 11 designated Code section 232.147(3B) provides that if the court
 13 12 has excluded the public from a hearing pursuant to Code section
 13 13 232.39 or 232.92, the transcript of the proceedings shall not
 13 14 be deemed a public record and inspection and disclosure of
 13 15 the contents of the transcript shall not be permitted except
 13 16 pursuant to a court order or unless otherwise provided in Code
 13 17 chapter 232.
 13 18    USE OF ADJUDICATION OF DELINQUENCY FOR PENALTY ENHANCEMENTS
 13 19 OR EVIDENCE.  The bill in newly designated Code section
 13 20 232.147(13) provides that the confidentiality of a final
 13 21 adjudication of delinquency under Code section 232.147 or
 13 22 pursuant to Code section 232.149A shall not prohibit the state
 13 23 from pleading or proving the adjudication at a subsequent
 13 24 criminal or delinquency proceeding for the purpose of penalty
 13 25 enhancement when a provision of the Code specifically deems the
 13 26 delinquency adjudication to constitute a final conviction.
 13 27    The bill in newly designated Code section 232.147(14)
 13 28 provides that the provisions of the bill shall not be construed
 13 29 to limit or restrict the production, use, or introduction
 13 30 of official juvenile court records in any juvenile or adult
 13 31 criminal proceeding, where such records are relevant and deemed
 13 32 admissible under any other provision of the law.
 13 33    CONFIDENTIALITY OF RECORDS AND FILES OF CRIMINAL OR
 13 34 JUVENILE JUSTICE AGENCIES.  Under current law, records and
 13 35 files of a criminal or juvenile justice agency concerning
 14  1 a child involved in a delinquent act are public records,
 14  2 subject to certain exceptions. The bill in Code section
 14  3 232.149 provides that the records and files of a criminal or
 14  4 juvenile justice agency, an intake officer, or a juvenile court
 14  5 officer concerning a child involved in a delinquent act are
 14  6 confidential. The bill further provides that the records of an
 14  7 intake officer or juvenile court officer containing a dismissal
 14  8 of a complaint or an informal adjustment of a complaint when
 14  9 no petition is filed relating to the complaint, shall not be
 14 10 available to the public, but may be disclosed to the judge and
 14 11 professional court staff, including juvenile court officers;
 14 12 the child's counsel or guardian ad litem; the county attorney
 14 13 and county attorney's assistants;  the superintendent or the
 14 14 superintendent's designee of the school district for the
 14 15 school attended by the child or the authorities in charge of
 14 16 an accredited nonpublic school attended by the child; a member
 14 17 of the armed forces of the United States who is conducting a
 14 18 background investigation of an individual pursuant to federal
 14 19 law; the statistical analysis center for the purposes stated
 14 20 in Code section 216A.136; the state public defender;  the
 14 21 department of human services; and the alleged victim of the
 14 22 delinquent act.
 14 23    PUBLIC RECORDS HEARINGS.  The bill enacts new Code section
 14 24 232.149B, which provides that a person may apply for a court
 14 25 order to make confidential juvenile court records public.
 14 26 The bill provides that a rebuttable presumption exists that
 14 27 official juvenile court records shall remain confidential. The
 14 28 bill provides that the court shall order the official juvenile
 14 29 court records in such a delinquency proceeding to be public
 14 30 records if either the public's interest in making the records
 14 31 public outweighs the juvenile's interest in maintaining the
 14 32 confidentiality of the records or the juvenile has been placed
 14 33 on youthful offender status pursuant to Code section 232.45(7)
 14 34 and Code section 907.3A(1), and will be transferred back to
 14 35 the district court for sentencing prior to the child's 18th
 15  1 birthday. The court may order the official juvenile court
 15  2 records in such a delinquency proceeding to be public records
 15  3 if the juvenile has been subsequently adjudicated delinquent
 15  4 for a public offense that would be a serious misdemeanor,
 15  5 aggravated misdemeanor, or felony offense if committed by an
 15  6 adult, or another delinquency proceeding is pending seeking
 15  7 such an adjudication. The bill provides that records subject
 15  8 to a public records order may be sealed at a later date
 15  9 pursuant to Code section 232.150.
 15 10    RIGHT TO REVIEW AND RELEASE A CONFIDENTIAL COMPLAINT.  The
 15 11 bill provides that delinquency complaints shall be released
 15 12 in accordance with Code section 915.25. Under current Code
 15 13 section 915.25, a complaint which alleges that a child who is
 15 14 at least 10 years of age committed a delinquent act, which if
 15 15 committed by an adult would be a public offense, is a public
 15 16 record. Current Code section 915.25 authorizes the court,
 15 17 its designee, or law enforcement officials to release such
 15 18 a complaint, including the identity of the child. The bill
 15 19 amends Code section 915.25 to provide that such a complaint
 15 20 is confidential unless the complaint alleges that the child
 15 21 committed a delinquent act that if committed by an adult would
 15 22 be a forcible felony. However, the bill authorizes state and
 15 23 local enforcement officials to release a confidential complaint
 15 24 against a child if the child is at large and doing so is deemed
 15 25 necessary for the protection of the public or the safety of
 15 26 the child. If the complaint is not confidential because the
 15 27 alleged delinquent act is an act that would be a forcible
 15 28 felony if committed by an adult, the court, its designee,
 15 29 or law enforcement officials may release such a complaint,
 15 30 including the identity of the child.
 15 31    The bill provides that an intake or juvenile court officer
 15 32 shall disclose to the alleged victim of a delinquent act, upon
 15 33 request, the complaint, the name and address of the child who
 15 34 allegedly committed the delinquent act, and the disposition
 15 35 of the complaint. If the alleged delinquent act would be
 16  1 a forcible felony if committed by an adult, the intake or
 16  2 juvenile court officer shall provide notification to the victim
 16  3 as required by Code section 915.24.
 16  4    SEALING OF JUVENILE COURT RECORDS UNAVAILABLE FOR
 16  5 OPERATING=WHILE=INTOXICATED VIOLATIONS.  Under current Code
 16  6 section 232.150, a court shall order juvenile court records
 16  7 to be sealed if the person who is the subject of the juvenile
 16  8 court records is 18 years of age or older and 2 years have
 16  9 elapsed since the last official action in the person's case,
 16 10 the person has not been subsequently convicted of a felony
 16 11 or an aggravated or serious misdemeanor or adjudicated a
 16 12 delinquent child for an act which if committed by an adult
 16 13 would be a felony, an aggravated misdemeanor, or a serious
 16 14 misdemeanor and no proceeding is pending seeking such
 16 15 conviction or adjudication, and the person was not placed on
 16 16 youthful offender status, transferred back to district court
 16 17 after the youthful offender's 18th birthday, and sentenced for
 16 18 the offense which precipitated the youthful offender placement.
 16 19 The bill in newly designated Code section 232.150(4) provides
 16 20 that the court shall not seal a person's juvenile court records
 16 21 if the person was adjudicated delinquent for violating Code
 16 22 section 321J.2, which prohibits the operation of a motor
 16 23 vehicle while under the influence of alcohol or a drug.
 16 24    RELEASE OF CONFIDENTIAL RECORDS.  The bill provides that a
 16 25 public record which is confidential under the provisions of
 16 26 Code chapter 232 shall only be subject to release upon order of
 16 27 a court in a proceeding under Code chapter 232.
 16 28    EXISTING CONFIDENTIALITY EXEMPTIONS.  The bill retains
 16 29 certain existing exemptions to confidentiality of juvenile
 16 30 court records. Pursuant to Code section 692A.121(8), records
 16 31 concerning sex offense convictions which are committed by
 16 32 minors may be released in the same manner as records of
 16 33 convictions of adults. Pursuant to Code section 915.10A,
 16 34 information concerning a juvenile charged with a felony offense
 16 35 may be released pursuant to an automated victim notification
 17  1 system. Under the bill, these exemptions to confidentiality
 17  2 are not amended and therefore still apply to juvenile court
 17  3 records.
 17  4    RIGHT TO COUNSEL.  The bill in Code section 232.11 provides
 17  5 that a child has the right to be represented by counsel at a
 17  6 hearing on a confidentiality order under Code section 232.149A
 17  7 or a public records order under Code section 232.149B.

 13 19 OR EVIDENCE.  The bill in newly designated Code section
 13 20 232.147(13) provides that the confidentiality of a final
 13 21 adjudication of delinquency under Code section 232.147 or
 13 22 pursuant to Code section 232.149A shall not prohibit the state
 13 23 from pleading or proving the adjudication at a subsequent

 13 33    CONFIDENTIALITY OF RECORDS AND FILES OF CRIMINAL OR

 15 10    RIGHT TO REVIEW AND RELEASE A CONFIDENTIAL COMPLAINT.  The
 15 11 bill provides that delinquency complaints shall be released
 15 12 in accordance with Code section 915.25. Under current Code
 15 13 section 915.25, a complaint which alleges that a child who is
 15 14 at least 10 years of age committed a delinquent act, which if

 15 19 amends Code section 915.25 to provide that such a complaint
 15 20 is confidential unless the complaint alleges that the child
 15 21 committed a delinquent act that if committed by an adult would
 15 22 be a forcible felony. However, the bill authorizes state and
 15 23 local enforcement officials to release a confidential complaint
 15 24 against a child if the child is at large and doing so is deemed
 15 25 necessary for the protection of the public or the safety of
 15 26 the child. If the complaint is not confidential because the
 15 27 alleged delinquent act is an act that would be a forcible
 15 28 felony if committed by an adult, the court, its designee,
 15 29 or law enforcement officials may release such a complaint,
 15 30 including the identity of the child.
 15 31    The bill provides that an intake or juvenile court officer
 15 32 shall disclose to the alleged victim of a delinquent act, upon
 15 33 request, the complaint, the name and address of the child who
 15 34 allegedly committed the delinquent act, and the disposition
 15 35 of the complaint. If the alleged delinquent act would be
 16  1 a forcible felony if committed by an adult, the intake or
 16  2 juvenile court officer shall provide notification to the victim
 16  3 as required by Code section 915.24.
 16  4    SEALING OF JUVENILE COURT RECORDS UNAVAILABLE FOR
 16  5 OPERATING=WHILE=INTOXICATED VIOLATIONS.  Under current Code
 16  6 section 232.150, a court shall order juvenile court records
 16  7 to be sealed if the person who is the subject of the juvenile
 16  8 court records is 18 years of age or older and 2 years have
 16  9 elapsed since the last official action in the person's case,
 16 10 the person has not been subsequently convicted of a felony
 16 11 or an aggravated or serious misdemeanor or adjudicated a
 16 12 delinquent child for an act which if committed by an adult
 16 13 would be a felony, an aggravated misdemeanor, or a serious
 16 14 misdemeanor and no proceeding is pending seeking such
 16 15 conviction or adjudication, and the person was not placed on
 16 16 youthful offender status, transferred back to district court
 16 17 after the youthful offender's 18th birthday, and sentenced for
 16 18 the offense which precipitated the youthful offender placement.
 16 19 The bill in newly designated Code section 232.150(4) provides
 16 20 that the court shall not seal a person's juvenile court records
 16 21 if the person was adjudicated delinquent for violating Code
 16 22 section 321J.2, which prohibits the operation of a motor
 16 23 vehicle while under the influence of alcohol or a drug.
 16 24    RELEASE OF CONFIDENTIAL RECORDS.  The bill provides that a
 16 25 public record which is confidential under the provisions of
 16 26 Code chapter 232 shall only be subject to release upon order of
 16 27 a court in a proceeding under Code chapter 232.
 16 28    EXISTING CONFIDENTIALITY EXEMPTIONS.  The bill retains
 16 29 certain existing exemptions to confidentiality of juvenile
 16 30 court records. Pursuant to Code section 692A.121(8), records
 16 31 concerning sex offense convictions which are committed by
 16 32 minors may be released in the same manner as records of
 16 33 convictions of adults. Pursuant to Code section 915.10A,
 16 34 information concerning a juvenile charged with a felony offense
 16 35 may be released pursuant to an automated victim notification
 17  1 system. Under the bill, these exemptions to confidentiality
 17  2 are not amended and therefore still apply to juvenile court
 17  3 records.
 17  4    RIGHT TO COUNSEL.  The bill in Code section 232.11 provides
 17  5 that a child has the right to be represented by counsel at a
 17  6 hearing on a confidentiality order under Code section 232.149A
 17  7 or a public records order under Code section 232.149B.
 17  8    APPLICABILITY.  The bill applies to juvenile delinquency

 13 10    CONFIDENTIALITY OF TRANSCRIPTS.  The bill in newly
 13 11 designated Code section 232.147(3B) provides that if the court
 13 12 has excluded the public from a hearing pursuant to Code section
 13 13 232.39 or 232.92, the transcript of the proceedings shall not
 13 14 be deemed a public record and inspection and disclosure of
 13 15 the contents of the transcript shall not be permitted except
 13 16 pursuant to a court order or unless otherwise provided in Code
 13 17 chapter 232.
 13 18    USE OF ADJUDICATION OF DELINQUENCY FOR PENALTY ENHANCEMENTS
 13 19 OR EVIDENCE.  The bill in newly designated Code section
 13 20 232.147(13) provides that the confidentiality of a final
 13 21 adjudication of delinquency under Code section 232.147 or
 13 22 pursuant to Code section 232.149A shall not prohibit the state
 13 23 from pleading or proving the adjudication at a subsequent
 13 24 criminal or delinquency proceeding for the purpose of penalty
 13 25 enhancement when a provision of the Code specifically deems the
 13 26 delinquency adjudication to constitute a final conviction.
 13 27    The bill in newly designated Code section 232.147(14)
 13 28 provides that the provisions of the bill shall not be construed
 13 29 to limit or restrict the production, use, or introduction
 13 30 of official juvenile court records in any juvenile or adult
 13 31 criminal proceeding, where such records are relevant and deemed
 13 32 admissible under any other provision of the law.
 13 33    CONFIDENTIALITY OF RECORDS AND FILES OF CRIMINAL OR
 13 34 JUVENILE JUSTICE AGENCIES.  Under current law, records and
 13 35 files of a criminal or juvenile justice agency concerning
 14  1 a child involved in a delinquent act are public records,
 14  2 subject to certain exceptions. The bill in Code section
 14  3 232.149 provides that the records and files of a criminal or
 14  4 juvenile justice agency, an intake officer, or a juvenile court
 14  5 officer concerning a child involved in a delinquent act are
 14  6 confidential. The bill further provides that the records of an
 14  7 intake officer or juvenile court officer containing a dismissal
 14  8 of a complaint or an informal adjustment of a complaint when
 14  9 no petition is filed relating to the complaint, shall not be
 14 10 available to the public, but may be disclosed to the judge and
 14 11 professional court staff, including juvenile court officers;
 14 12 the child's counsel or guardian ad litem; the county attorney
 14 13 and county attorney's assistants;  the superintendent or the
 14 14 superintendent's designee of the school district for the
 14 15 school attended by the child or the authorities in charge of
 14 16 an accredited nonpublic school attended by the child; a member
 14 17 of the armed forces of the United States who is conducting a
 14 18 background investigation of an individual pursuant to federal
 14 19 law; the statistical analysis center for the purposes stated
 14 20 in Code section 216A.136; the state public defender;  the
 14 21 department of human services; and the alleged victim of the
 14 22 delinquent act.
 14 23    PUBLIC RECORDS HEARINGS.  The bill enacts new Code section
 14 24 232.149B, which provides that a person may apply for a court
 14 25 order to make confidential juvenile court records public.
 14 26 The bill provides that a rebuttable presumption exists that
 14 27 official juvenile court records shall remain confidential. The
 14 28 bill provides that the court shall order the official juvenile
 14 29 court records in such a delinquency proceeding to be public
 14 30 records if either the public's interest in making the records
 14 31 public outweighs the juvenile's interest in maintaining the
 14 32 confidentiality of the records or the juvenile has been placed
 14 33 on youthful offender status pursuant to Code section 232.45(7)
 14 34 and Code section 907.3A(1), and will be transferred back to
 14 35 the district court for sentencing prior to the child's 18th
 15  1 birthday. The court may order the official juvenile court
 15  2 records in such a delinquency proceeding to be public records
 15  3 if the juvenile has been subsequently adjudicated delinquent
 15  4 for a public offense that would be a serious misdemeanor,
 15  5 aggravated misdemeanor, or felony offense if committed by an
 15  6 adult, or another delinquency proceeding is pending seeking
 15  7 such an adjudication. The bill provides that records subject
 15  8 to a public records order may be sealed at a later date
 15  9 pursuant to Code section 232.150.
 15 10    RIGHT TO REVIEW AND RELEASE A CONFIDENTIAL COMPLAINT.  The
 15 11 bill provides that delinquency complaints shall be released
 15 12 in accordance with Code section 915.25. Under current Code
 15 13 section 915.25, a complaint which alleges that a child who is
 15 14 at least 10 years of age committed a delinquent act, which if
 15 15 committed by an adult would be a public offense, is a public
 15 16 record. Current Code section 915.25 authorizes the court,
 15 17 its designee, or law enforcement officials to release such
 15 18 a complaint, including the identity of the child. The bill
 15 19 amends Code section 915.25 to provide that such a complaint
 15 20 is confidential unless the complaint alleges that the child
 15 21 committed a delinquent act that if committed by an adult would
 15 22 be a forcible felony. However, the bill authorizes state and
 15 23 local enforcement officials to release a confidential complaint
 15 24 against a child if the child is at large and doing so is deemed
 15 25 necessary for the protection of the public or the safety of
 15 26 the child. If the complaint is not confidential because the
 15 27 alleged delinquent act is an act that would be a forcible
 15 28 felony if committed by an adult, the court, its designee,
 15 29 or law enforcement officials may release such a complaint,
 15 30 including the identity of the child.
 15 31    The bill provides that an intake or juvenile court officer
 15 32 shall disclose to the alleged victim of a delinquent act, upon
 15 33 request, the complaint, the name and address of the child who
 15 34 allegedly committed the delinquent act, and the disposition
 15 35 of the complaint. If the alleged delinquent act would be
 16  1 a forcible felony if committed by an adult, the intake or
 16  2 juvenile court officer shall provide notification to the victim
 16  3 as required by Code section 915.24.
 16  4    SEALING OF JUVENILE COURT RECORDS UNAVAILABLE FOR
 16  5 OPERATING=WHILE=INTOXICATED VIOLATIONS.  Under current Code
 16  6 section 232.150, a court shall order juvenile court records
 16  7 to be sealed if the person who is the subject of the juvenile
 16  8 court records is 18 years of age or older and 2 years have
 16  9 elapsed since the last official action in the person's case,
 16 10 the person has not been subsequently convicted of a felony
 16 11 or an aggravated or serious misdemeanor or adjudicated a
 16 12 delinquent child for an act which if committed by an adult
 16 13 would be a felony, an aggravated misdemeanor, or a serious
 16 14 misdemeanor and no proceeding is pending seeking such
 16 15 conviction or adjudication, and the person was not placed on
 16 16 youthful offender status, transferred back to district court
 16 17 after the youthful offender's 18th birthday, and sentenced for
 16 18 the offense which precipitated the youthful offender placement.
 16 19 The bill in newly designated Code section 232.150(4) provides
 16 20 that the court shall not seal a person's juvenile court records
 16 21 if the person was adjudicated delinquent for violating Code
 16 22 section 321J.2, which prohibits the operation of a motor
 16 23 vehicle while under the influence of alcohol or a drug.
 16 24    RELEASE OF CONFIDENTIAL RECORDS.  The bill provides that a
 16 25 public record which is confidential under the provisions of
 16 26 Code chapter 232 shall only be subject to release upon order of
 16 27 a court in a proceeding under Code chapter 232.
 16 28    EXISTING CONFIDENTIALITY EXEMPTIONS.  The bill retains
 16 29 certain existing exemptions to confidentiality of juvenile
 16 30 court records. Pursuant to Code section 692A.121(8), records
 16 31 concerning sex offense convictions which are committed by
 16 32 minors may be released in the same manner as records of
 16 33 convictions of adults. Pursuant to Code section 915.10A,
 16 34 information concerning a juvenile charged with a felony offense
 16 35 may be released pursuant to an automated victim notification
 17  1 system. Under the bill, these exemptions to confidentiality
 17  2 are not amended and therefore still apply to juvenile court
 17  3 records.
 17  4    RIGHT TO COUNSEL.  The bill in Code section 232.11 provides
 17  5 that a child has the right to be represented by counsel at a
 17  6 hearing on a confidentiality order under Code section 232.149A
 17  7 or a public records order under Code section 232.149B.
 17  8    APPLICABILITY.  The bill applies to juvenile delinquency

 13 10    CONFIDENTIALITY OF TRANSCRIPTS.  The bill in newly
 13 11 designated Code section 232.147(3B) provides that if the court
 13 12 has excluded the public from a hearing pursuant to Code section
 13 13 232.39 or 232.92, the transcript of the proceedings shall not
 13 14 be deemed a public record and inspection and disclosure of

 13 17 chapter 232.
 13 18    USE OF ADJUDICATION OF DELINQUENCY FOR PENALTY ENHANCEMENTS
 13 19 OR EVIDENCE.  The bill in newly designated Code section
 13 20 232.147(13) provides that the confidentiality of a final
 13 21 adjudication of delinquency under Code section 232.147 or
 13 22 pursuant to Code section 232.149A shall not prohibit the state
 13 23 from pleading or proving the adjudication at a subsequent
 13 24 criminal or delinquency proceeding for the purpose of penalty
 13 25 enhancement when a provision of the Code specifically deems the
 13 26 delinquency adjudication to constitute a final conviction.
 13 27    The bill in newly designated Code section 232.147(14)
 13 28 provides that the provisions of the bill shall not be construed
 13 29 to limit or restrict the production, use, or introduction
 13 30 of official juvenile court records in any juvenile or adult
 13 31 criminal proceeding, where such records are relevant and deemed
 13 32 admissible under any other provision of the law.
 13 33    CONFIDENTIALITY OF RECORDS AND FILES OF CRIMINAL OR
 13 34 JUVENILE JUSTICE AGENCIES.  Under current law, records and
 13 35 files of a criminal or juvenile justice agency concerning
 14  1 a child involved in a delinquent act are public records,
 14  2 subject to certain exceptions. The bill in Code section
 14  3 232.149 provides that the records and files of a criminal or
 14  4 juvenile justice agency, an intake officer, or a juvenile court
 14  5 officer concerning a child involved in a delinquent act are
 14  6 confidential. The bill further provides that the records of an
 14  7 intake officer or juvenile court officer containing a dismissal
 14  8 of a complaint or an informal adjustment of a complaint when
 14  9 no petition is filed relating to the complaint, shall not be
 14 10 available to the public, but may be disclosed to the judge and
 14 11 professional court staff, including juvenile court officers;
 14 12 the child's counsel or guardian ad litem; the county attorney
 14 13 and county attorney's assistants;  the superintendent or the
 14 14 superintendent's designee of the school district for the
 14 15 school attended by the child or the authorities in charge of
 14 16 an accredited nonpublic school attended by the child; a member
 14 17 of the armed forces of the United States who is conducting a
 14 18 background investigation of an individual pursuant to federal
 14 19 law; the statistical analysis center for the purposes stated
 14 20 in Code section 216A.136; the state public defender;  the
 14 21 department of human services; and the alleged victim of the
 14 22 delinquent act.
 14 23    PUBLIC RECORDS HEARINGS.  The bill enacts new Code section
 14 24 232.149B, which provides that a person may apply for a court
 14 25 order to make confidential juvenile court records public.
 14 26 The bill provides that a rebuttable presumption exists that
 14 27 official juvenile court records shall remain confidential. The
 14 28 bill provides that the court shall order the official juvenile
 14 29 court records in such a delinquency proceeding to be public
 14 30 records if either the public's interest in making the records
 14 31 public outweighs the juvenile's interest in maintaining the
 14 32 confidentiality of the records or the juvenile has been placed
 14 33 on youthful offender status pursuant to Code section 232.45(7)
 14 34 and Code section 907.3A(1), and will be transferred back to
 14 35 the district court for sentencing prior to the child's 18th
 15  1 birthday. The court may order the official juvenile court
 15  2 records in such a delinquency proceeding to be public records
 15  3 if the juvenile has been subsequently adjudicated delinquent
 15  4 for a public offense that would be a serious misdemeanor,
 15  5 aggravated misdemeanor, or felony offense if committed by an
 15  6 adult, or another delinquency proceeding is pending seeking
 15  7 such an adjudication. The bill provides that records subject
 15  8 to a public records order may be sealed at a later date
 15  9 pursuant to Code section 232.150.
 15 10    RIGHT TO REVIEW AND RELEASE A CONFIDENTIAL COMPLAINT.  The
 15 11 bill provides that delinquency complaints shall be released
 15 12 in accordance with Code section 915.25. Under current Code
 15 13 section 915.25, a complaint which alleges that a child who is
 15 14 at least 10 years of age committed a delinquent act, which if
 15 15 committed by an adult would be a public offense, is a public
 15 16 record. Current Code section 915.25 authorizes the court,
 15 17 its designee, or law enforcement officials to release such
 15 18 a complaint, including the identity of the child. The bill
 15 19 amends Code section 915.25 to provide that such a complaint
 15 20 is confidential unless the complaint alleges that the child
 15 21 committed a delinquent act that if committed by an adult would
 15 22 be a forcible felony. However, the bill authorizes state and
 15 23 local enforcement officials to release a confidential complaint
 15 24 against a child if the child is at large and doing so is deemed
 15 25 necessary for the protection of the public or the safety of
 15 26 the child. If the complaint is not confidential because the
 15 27 alleged delinquent act is an act that would be a forcible
 15 28 felony if committed by an adult, the court, its designee,
 15 29 or law enforcement officials may release such a complaint,
 15 30 including the identity of the child.
 15 31    The bill provides that an intake or juvenile court officer
 15 32 shall disclose to the alleged victim of a delinquent act, upon
 15 33 request, the complaint, the name and address of the child who
 15 34 allegedly committed the delinquent act, and the disposition
 15 35 of the complaint. If the alleged delinquent act would be
 16  1 a forcible felony if committed by an adult, the intake or
 16  2 juvenile court officer shall provide notification to the victim
 16  3 as required by Code section 915.24.
 16  4    SEALING OF JUVENILE COURT RECORDS UNAVAILABLE FOR
 16  5 OPERATING=WHILE=INTOXICATED VIOLATIONS.  Under current Code
 16  6 section 232.150, a court shall order juvenile court records
 16  7 to be sealed if the person who is the subject of the juvenile
 16  8 court records is 18 years of age or older and 2 years have
 16  9 elapsed since the last official action in the person's case,
 16 10 the person has not been subsequently convicted of a felony
 16 11 or an aggravated or serious misdemeanor or adjudicated a
 16 12 delinquent child for an act which if committed by an adult
 16 13 would be a felony, an aggravated misdemeanor, or a serious
 16 14 misdemeanor and no proceeding is pending seeking such
 16 15 conviction or adjudication, and the person was not placed on
 16 16 youthful offender status, transferred back to district court
 16 17 after the youthful offender's 18th birthday, and sentenced for
 16 18 the offense which precipitated the youthful offender placement.
 16 19 The bill in newly designated Code section 232.150(4) provides
 16 20 that the court shall not seal a person's juvenile court records
 16 21 if the person was adjudicated delinquent for violating Code
 16 22 section 321J.2, which prohibits the operation of a motor
 16 23 vehicle while under the influence of alcohol or a drug.
 16 24    RELEASE OF CONFIDENTIAL RECORDS.  The bill provides that a
 16 25 public record which is confidential under the provisions of
 16 26 Code chapter 232 shall only be subject to release upon order of
 16 27 a court in a proceeding under Code chapter 232.
 16 28    EXISTING CONFIDENTIALITY EXEMPTIONS.  The bill retains
 16 29 certain existing exemptions to confidentiality of juvenile
 16 30 court records. Pursuant to Code section 692A.121(8), records
 16 31 concerning sex offense convictions which are committed by
 16 32 minors may be released in the same manner as records of
 16 33 convictions of adults. Pursuant to Code section 915.10A,
 16 34 information concerning a juvenile charged with a felony offense
 16 35 may be released pursuant to an automated victim notification

 13 21 adjudication of delinquency under Code section 232.147 or
 13 22 pursuant to Code section 232.149A shall not prohibit the state
 13 23 from pleading or proving the adjudication at a subsequent

 13 26 delinquency adjudication to constitute a final conviction.
 13 27    The bill in newly designated Code section 232.147(14)
 13 28 provides that the provisions of the bill shall not be construed
 13 29 to limit or restrict the production, use, or introduction
 13 30 of official juvenile court records in any juvenile or adult
 13 31 criminal proceeding, where such records are relevant and deemed
 13 32 admissible under any other provision of the law.
 13 33    CONFIDENTIALITY OF RECORDS AND FILES OF CRIMINAL OR
 13 34 JUVENILE JUSTICE AGENCIES.  Under current law, records and
 13 35 files of a criminal or juvenile justice agency concerning
 14  1 a child involved in a delinquent act are public records,
 14  2 subject to certain exceptions. The bill in Code section
 14  3 232.149 provides that the records and files of a criminal or
 14  4 juvenile justice agency, an intake officer, or a juvenile court
 14  5 officer concerning a child involved in a delinquent act are
 14  6 confidential. The bill further provides that the records of an
 14  7 intake officer or juvenile court officer containing a dismissal
 14  8 of a complaint or an informal adjustment of a complaint when
 14  9 no petition is filed relating to the complaint, shall not be
 14 10 available to the public, but may be disclosed to the judge and
 14 11 professional court staff, including juvenile court officers;
 14 12 the child's counsel or guardian ad litem; the county attorney
 14 13 and county attorney's assistants;  the superintendent or the
 14 14 superintendent's designee of the school district for the
 14 15 school attended by the child or the authorities in charge of
 14 16 an accredited nonpublic school attended by the child; a member
 14 17 of the armed forces of the United States who is conducting a
 14 18 background investigation of an individual pursuant to federal
 14 19 law; the statistical analysis center for the purposes stated
 14 20 in Code section 216A.136; the state public defender;  the
 14 21 department of human services; and the alleged victim of the
 14 22 delinquent act.
 14 23    PUBLIC RECORDS HEARINGS.  The bill enacts new Code section
 14 24 232.149B, which provides that a person may apply for a court
 14 25 order to make confidential juvenile court records public.
 14 26 The bill provides that a rebuttable presumption exists that
 14 27 official juvenile court records shall remain confidential. The
 14 28 bill provides that the court shall order the official juvenile
 14 29 court records in such a delinquency proceeding to be public
 14 30 records if either the public's interest in making the records
 14 31 public outweighs the juvenile's interest in maintaining the
 14 32 confidentiality of the records or the juvenile has been placed
 14 33 on youthful offender status pursuant to Code section 232.45(7)
 14 34 and Code section 907.3A(1), and will be transferred back to
 14 35 the district court for sentencing prior to the child's 18th
 15  1 birthday. The court may order the official juvenile court
 15  2 records in such a delinquency proceeding to be public records
 15  3 if the juvenile has been subsequently adjudicated delinquent
 15  4 for a public offense that would be a serious misdemeanor,
 15  5 aggravated misdemeanor, or felony offense if committed by an
 15  6 adult, or another delinquency proceeding is pending seeking
 15  7 such an adjudication. The bill provides that records subject
 15  8 to a public records order may be sealed at a later date
 15  9 pursuant to Code section 232.150.
 15 10    RIGHT TO REVIEW AND RELEASE A CONFIDENTIAL COMPLAINT.  The
 15 11 bill provides that delinquency complaints shall be released
 15 12 in accordance with Code section 915.25. Under current Code
 15 13 section 915.25, a complaint which alleges that a child who is
 15 14 at least 10 years of age committed a delinquent act, which if
 15 15 committed by an adult would be a public offense, is a public
 15 16 record. Current Code section 915.25 authorizes the court,
 15 17 its designee, or law enforcement officials to release such
 15 18 a complaint, including the identity of the child. The bill
 15 19 amends Code section 915.25 to provide that such a complaint
 15 20 is confidential unless the complaint alleges that the child
 15 21 committed a delinquent act that if committed by an adult would
 15 22 be a forcible felony. However, the bill authorizes state and
 15 23 local enforcement officials to release a confidential complaint
 15 24 against a child if the child is at large and doing so is deemed
 15 25 necessary for the protection of the public or the safety of
 15 26 the child. If the complaint is not confidential because the
 15 27 alleged delinquent act is an act that would be a forcible
 15 28 felony if committed by an adult, the court, its designee,
 15 29 or law enforcement officials may release such a complaint,
 15 30 including the identity of the child.
 15 31    The bill provides that an intake or juvenile court officer
 15 32 shall disclose to the alleged victim of a delinquent act, upon
 15 33 request, the complaint, the name and address of the child who
 15 34 allegedly committed the delinquent act, and the disposition
 15 35 of the complaint. If the alleged delinquent act would be
 16  1 a forcible felony if committed by an adult, the intake or
 16  2 juvenile court officer shall provide notification to the victim
 16  3 as required by Code section 915.24.
 16  4    SEALING OF JUVENILE COURT RECORDS UNAVAILABLE FOR
 16  5 OPERATING=WHILE=INTOXICATED VIOLATIONS.  Under current Code
 16  6 section 232.150, a court shall order juvenile court records
 16  7 to be sealed if the person who is the subject of the juvenile
 16  8 court records is 18 years of age or older and 2 years have
 16  9 elapsed since the last official action in the person's case,
 16 10 the person has not been subsequently convicted of a felony
 16 11 or an aggravated or serious misdemeanor or adjudicated a
 16 12 delinquent child for an act which if committed by an adult
 16 13 would be a felony, an aggravated misdemeanor, or a serious
 16 14 misdemeanor and no proceeding is pending seeking such
 16 15 conviction or adjudication, and the person was not placed on
 16 16 youthful offender status, transferred back to district court
 16 17 after the youthful offender's 18th birthday, and sentenced for
 16 18 the offense which precipitated the youthful offender placement.
 16 19 The bill in newly designated Code section 232.150(4) provides
 16 20 that the court shall not seal a person's juvenile court records
 16 21 if the person was adjudicated delinquent for violating Code
 16 22 section 321J.2, which prohibits the operation of a motor
 16 23 vehicle while under the influence of alcohol or a drug.
 16 24    RELEASE OF CONFIDENTIAL RECORDS.  The bill provides that a
 16 25 public record which is confidential under the provisions of
 16 26 Code chapter 232 shall only be subject to release upon order of
 16 27 a court in a proceeding under Code chapter 232.
 16 28    EXISTING CONFIDENTIALITY EXEMPTIONS.  The bill retains
 16 29 certain existing exemptions to confidentiality of juvenile
 16 30 court records. Pursuant to Code section 692A.121(8), records
 16 31 concerning sex offense convictions which are committed by
 16 32 minors may be released in the same manner as records of
 16 33 convictions of adults. Pursuant to Code section 915.10A,
 16 34 information concerning a juvenile charged with a felony offense
 16 35 may be released pursuant to an automated victim notification
 17  1 system. Under the bill, these exemptions to confidentiality
 17  2 are not amended and therefore still apply to juvenile court
 17  3 records.
 17  4    RIGHT TO COUNSEL.  The bill in Code section 232.11 provides
 17  5 that a child has the right to be represented by counsel at a
 17  6 hearing on a confidentiality order under Code section 232.149A
 17  7 or a public records order under Code section 232.149B.
 17  8    APPLICABILITY.  The bill applies to juvenile delinquency
 17  9 proceedings which are pending or arise on or after July 1,

 13  7 of human services; the department of corrections; a judicial
 13  8 district department of correctional services; and the board of
 13  9 parole.
 13 10    CONFIDENTIALITY OF TRANSCRIPTS.  The bill in newly
 13 11 designated Code section 232.147(3B) provides that if the court
 13 12 has excluded the public from a hearing pursuant to Code section
 13 13 232.39 or 232.92, the transcript of the proceedings shall not
 13 14 be deemed a public record and inspection and disclosure of
 13 15 the contents of the transcript shall not be permitted except
 13 16 pursuant to a court order or unless otherwise provided in Code
 13 17 chapter 232.
 13 18    USE OF ADJUDICATION OF DELINQUENCY FOR PENALTY ENHANCEMENTS
 13 19 OR EVIDENCE.  The bill in newly designated Code section
 13 20 232.147(13) provides that the confidentiality of a final
 13 21 adjudication of delinquency under Code section 232.147 or
 13 22 pursuant to Code section 232.149A shall not prohibit the state
 13 23 from pleading or proving the adjudication at a subsequent
 13 24 criminal or delinquency proceeding for the purpose of penalty
 13 25 enhancement when a provision of the Code specifically deems the
 13 26 delinquency adjudication to constitute a final conviction.
 13 27    The bill in newly designated Code section 232.147(14)
 13 28 provides that the provisions of the bill shall not be construed
 13 29 to limit or restrict the production, use, or introduction
 13 30 of official juvenile court records in any juvenile or adult
 13 31 criminal proceeding, where such records are relevant and deemed
 13 32 admissible under any other provision of the law.
 13 33    CONFIDENTIALITY OF RECORDS AND FILES OF CRIMINAL OR
 13 34 JUVENILE JUSTICE AGENCIES.  Under current law, records and
 13 35 files of a criminal or juvenile justice agency concerning
 14  1 a child involved in a delinquent act are public records,
 14  2 subject to certain exceptions. The bill in Code section
 14  3 232.149 provides that the records and files of a criminal or
 14  4 juvenile justice agency, an intake officer, or a juvenile court
 14  5 officer concerning a child involved in a delinquent act are
 14  6 confidential. The bill further provides that the records of an
 14  7 intake officer or juvenile court officer containing a dismissal
 14  8 of a complaint or an informal adjustment of a complaint when
 14  9 no petition is filed relating to the complaint, shall not be
 14 10 available to the public, but may be disclosed to the judge and
 14 11 professional court staff, including juvenile court officers;
 14 12 the child's counsel or guardian ad litem; the county attorney
 14 13 and county attorney's assistants;  the superintendent or the
 14 14 superintendent's designee of the school district for the
 14 15 school attended by the child or the authorities in charge of
 14 16 an accredited nonpublic school attended by the child; a member
 14 17 of the armed forces of the United States who is conducting a
 14 18 background investigation of an individual pursuant to federal
 14 19 law; the statistical analysis center for the purposes stated
 14 20 in Code section 216A.136; the state public defender;  the
 14 21 department of human services; and the alleged victim of the
 14 22 delinquent act.
 14 23    PUBLIC RECORDS HEARINGS.  The bill enacts new Code section
 14 24 232.149B, which provides that a person may apply for a court
 14 25 order to make confidential juvenile court records public.
 14 26 The bill provides that a rebuttable presumption exists that
 14 27 official juvenile court records shall remain confidential. The
 14 28 bill provides that the court shall order the official juvenile
 14 29 court records in such a delinquency proceeding to be public
 14 30 records if either the public's interest in making the records
 14 31 public outweighs the juvenile's interest in maintaining the
 14 32 confidentiality of the records or the juvenile has been placed
 14 33 on youthful offender status pursuant to Code section 232.45(7)
 14 34 and Code section 907.3A(1), and will be transferred back to
 14 35 the district court for sentencing prior to the child's 18th
 15  1 birthday. The court may order the official juvenile court
 15  2 records in such a delinquency proceeding to be public records
 15  3 if the juvenile has been subsequently adjudicated delinquent
 15  4 for a public offense that would be a serious misdemeanor,
 15  5 aggravated misdemeanor, or felony offense if committed by an
 15  6 adult, or another delinquency proceeding is pending seeking
 15  7 such an adjudication. The bill provides that records subject
 15  8 to a public records order may be sealed at a later date
 15  9 pursuant to Code section 232.150.
 15 10    RIGHT TO REVIEW AND RELEASE A CONFIDENTIAL COMPLAINT.  The
 15 11 bill provides that delinquency complaints shall be released
 15 12 in accordance with Code section 915.25. Under current Code
 15 13 section 915.25, a complaint which alleges that a child who is
 15 14 at least 10 years of age committed a delinquent act, which if
 15 15 committed by an adult would be a public offense, is a public
 15 16 record. Current Code section 915.25 authorizes the court,
 15 17 its designee, or law enforcement officials to release such
 15 18 a complaint, including the identity of the child. The bill
 15 19 amends Code section 915.25 to provide that such a complaint
 15 20 is confidential unless the complaint alleges that the child
 15 21 committed a delinquent act that if committed by an adult would
 15 22 be a forcible felony. However, the bill authorizes state and
 15 23 local enforcement officials to release a confidential complaint
 15 24 against a child if the child is at large and doing so is deemed
 15 25 necessary for the protection of the public or the safety of
 15 26 the child. If the complaint is not confidential because the
 15 27 alleged delinquent act is an act that would be a forcible
 15 28 felony if committed by an adult, the court, its designee,
 15 29 or law enforcement officials may release such a complaint,
 15 30 including the identity of the child.
 15 31    The bill provides that an intake or juvenile court officer
 15 32 shall disclose to the alleged victim of a delinquent act, upon
 15 33 request, the complaint, the name and address of the child who
 15 34 allegedly committed the delinquent act, and the disposition
 15 35 of the complaint. If the alleged delinquent act would be
 16  1 a forcible felony if committed by an adult, the intake or
 16  2 juvenile court officer shall provide notification to the victim
 16  3 as required by Code section 915.24.
 16  4    SEALING OF JUVENILE COURT RECORDS UNAVAILABLE FOR
 16  5 OPERATING=WHILE=INTOXICATED VIOLATIONS.  Under current Code
 16  6 section 232.150, a court shall order juvenile court records
 16  7 to be sealed if the person who is the subject of the juvenile
 16  8 court records is 18 years of age or older and 2 years have
 16  9 elapsed since the last official action in the person's case,
 16 10 the person has not been subsequently convicted of a felony
 16 11 or an aggravated or serious misdemeanor or adjudicated a

 16 13 would be a felony, an aggravated misdemeanor, or a serious
 16 14 misdemeanor and no proceeding is pending seeking such
 16 15 conviction or adjudication, and the person was not placed on
 16 16 youthful offender status, transferred back to district court
 16 17 after the youthful offender's 18th birthday, and sentenced for
 16 18 the offense which precipitated the youthful offender placement.
 16 19 The bill in newly designated Code section 232.150(4) provides
 16 20 that the court shall not seal a person's juvenile court records
 16 21 if the person was adjudicated delinquent for violating Code
 16 22 section 321J.2, which prohibits the operation of a motor

 16 24    RELEASE OF CONFIDENTIAL RECORDS.  The bill provides that a
 16 25 public record which is confidential under the provisions of
 16 26 Code chapter 232 shall only be subject to release upon order of
 16 27 a court in a proceeding under Code chapter 232.

 16 24    RELEASE OF CONFIDENTIAL RECORDS.  The bill provides that a
 16 25 public record which is confidential under the provisions of
 16 26 Code chapter 232 shall only be subject to release upon order of
 16 27 a court in a proceeding under Code chapter 232.
 16 28    EXISTING CONFIDENTIALITY EXEMPTIONS.  The bill retains
 16 29 certain existing exemptions to confidentiality of juvenile
 16 30 court records. Pursuant to Code section 692A.121(8), records
 16 31 concerning sex offense convictions which are committed by
 16 32 minors may be released in the same manner as records of
 16 33 convictions of adults. Pursuant to Code section 915.10A,
 16 34 information concerning a juvenile charged with a felony offense
 16 35 may be released pursuant to an automated victim notification
 17  1 system. Under the bill, these exemptions to confidentiality
 17  2 are not amended and therefore still apply to juvenile court
 17  3 records.
 17  4    RIGHT TO COUNSEL.  The bill in Code section 232.11 provides
 17  5 that a child has the right to be represented by counsel at a

 13 10    CONFIDENTIALITY OF TRANSCRIPTS.  The bill in newly
 13 11 designated Code section 232.147(3B) provides that if the court
 13 12 has excluded the public from a hearing pursuant to Code section
 13 13 232.39 or 232.92, the transcript of the proceedings shall not
 13 14 be deemed a public record and inspection and disclosure of
 13 15 the contents of the transcript shall not be permitted except
 13 16 pursuant to a court order or unless otherwise provided in Code
 13 17 chapter 232.
 13 18    USE OF ADJUDICATION OF DELINQUENCY FOR PENALTY ENHANCEMENTS
 13 19 OR EVIDENCE.  The bill in newly designated Code section
 13 20 232.147(13) provides that the confidentiality of a final
 13 21 adjudication of delinquency under Code section 232.147 or
 13 22 pursuant to Code section 232.149A shall not prohibit the state
 13 23 from pleading or proving the adjudication at a subsequent
 13 24 criminal or delinquency proceeding for the purpose of penalty
 13 25 enhancement when a provision of the Code specifically deems the
 13 26 delinquency adjudication to constitute a final conviction.
 13 27    The bill in newly designated Code section 232.147(14)
 13 28 provides that the provisions of the bill shall not be construed
 13 29 to limit or restrict the production, use, or introduction
 13 30 of official juvenile court records in any juvenile or adult
 13 31 criminal proceeding, where such records are relevant and deemed
 13 32 admissible under any other provision of the law.
 13 33    CONFIDENTIALITY OF RECORDS AND FILES OF CRIMINAL OR
 13 34 JUVENILE JUSTICE AGENCIES.  Under current law, records and
 13 35 files of a criminal or juvenile justice agency concerning
 14  1 a child involved in a delinquent act are public records,
 14  2 subject to certain exceptions. The bill in Code section
 14  3 232.149 provides that the records and files of a criminal or
 14  4 juvenile justice agency, an intake officer, or a juvenile court
 14  5 officer concerning a child involved in a delinquent act are
 14  6 confidential. The bill further provides that the records of an
 14  7 intake officer or juvenile court officer containing a dismissal
 14  8 of a complaint or an informal adjustment of a complaint when
 14  9 no petition is filed relating to the complaint, shall not be
 14 10 available to the public, but may be disclosed to the judge and
 14 11 professional court staff, including juvenile court officers;
 14 12 the child's counsel or guardian ad litem; the county attorney
 14 13 and county attorney's assistants;  the superintendent or the
 14 14 superintendent's designee of the school district for the
 14 15 school attended by the child or the authorities in charge of
 14 16 an accredited nonpublic school attended by the child; a member
 14 17 of the armed forces of the United States who is conducting a
 14 18 background investigation of an individual pursuant to federal
 14 19 law; the statistical analysis center for the purposes stated
 14 20 in Code section 216A.136; the state public defender;  the
 14 21 department of human services; and the alleged victim of the
 14 22 delinquent act.
 14 23    PUBLIC RECORDS HEARINGS.  The bill enacts new Code section
 14 24 232.149B, which provides that a person may apply for a court
 14 25 order to make confidential juvenile court records public.
 14 26 The bill provides that a rebuttable presumption exists that
 14 27 official juvenile court records shall remain confidential. The
 14 28 bill provides that the court shall order the official juvenile
 14 29 court records in such a delinquency proceeding to be public
 14 30 records if either the public's interest in making the records
 14 31 public outweighs the juvenile's interest in maintaining the
 14 32 confidentiality of the records or the juvenile has been placed
 14 33 on youthful offender status pursuant to Code section 232.45(7)
 14 34 and Code section 907.3A(1), and will be transferred back to
 14 35 the district court for sentencing prior to the child's 18th
 15  1 birthday. The court may order the official juvenile court
 15  2 records in such a delinquency proceeding to be public records
 15  3 if the juvenile has been subsequently adjudicated delinquent
 15  4 for a public offense that would be a serious misdemeanor,
 15  5 aggravated misdemeanor, or felony offense if committed by an
 15  6 adult, or another delinquency proceeding is pending seeking
 15  7 such an adjudication. The bill provides that records subject
 15  8 to a public records order may be sealed at a later date
 15  9 pursuant to Code section 232.150.
 15 10    RIGHT TO REVIEW AND RELEASE A CONFIDENTIAL COMPLAINT.  The
 15 11 bill provides that delinquency complaints shall be released
 15 12 in accordance with Code section 915.25. Under current Code
 15 13 section 915.25, a complaint which alleges that a child who is
 15 14 at least 10 years of age committed a delinquent act, which if
 15 15 committed by an adult would be a public offense, is a public
 15 16 record. Current Code section 915.25 authorizes the court,
 15 17 its designee, or law enforcement officials to release such
 15 18 a complaint, including the identity of the child. The bill
 15 19 amends Code section 915.25 to provide that such a complaint
 15 20 is confidential unless the complaint alleges that the child
 15 21 committed a delinquent act that if committed by an adult would
 15 22 be a forcible felony. However, the bill authorizes state and
 15 23 local enforcement officials to release a confidential complaint
 15 24 against a child if the child is at large and doing so is deemed
 15 25 necessary for the protection of the public or the safety of
 15 26 the child. If the complaint is not confidential because the
 15 27 alleged delinquent act is an act that would be a forcible
 15 28 felony if committed by an adult, the court, its designee,
 15 29 or law enforcement officials may release such a complaint,
 15 30 including the identity of the child.
 15 31    The bill provides that an intake or juvenile court officer
 15 32 shall disclose to the alleged victim of a delinquent act, upon
 15 33 request, the complaint, the name and address of the child who
 15 34 allegedly committed the delinquent act, and the disposition
 15 35 of the complaint. If the alleged delinquent act would be
 16  1 a forcible felony if committed by an adult, the intake or
 16  2 juvenile court officer shall provide notification to the victim
 16  3 as required by Code section 915.24.
 16  4    SEALING OF JUVENILE COURT RECORDS UNAVAILABLE FOR
 16  5 OPERATING=WHILE=INTOXICATED VIOLATIONS.  Under current Code
 16  6 section 232.150, a court shall order juvenile court records
 16  7 to be sealed if the person who is the subject of the juvenile
 16  8 court records is 18 years of age or older and 2 years have
 16  9 elapsed since the last official action in the person's case,
 16 10 the person has not been subsequently convicted of a felony
 16 11 or an aggravated or serious misdemeanor or adjudicated a
 16 12 delinquent child for an act which if committed by an adult
 16 13 would be a felony, an aggravated misdemeanor, or a serious
 16 14 misdemeanor and no proceeding is pending seeking such
 16 15 conviction or adjudication, and the person was not placed on
 16 16 youthful offender status, transferred back to district court
 16 17 after the youthful offender's 18th birthday, and sentenced for
 16 18 the offense which precipitated the youthful offender placement.
 16 19 The bill in newly designated Code section 232.150(4) provides
 16 20 that the court shall not seal a person's juvenile court records
 16 21 if the person was adjudicated delinquent for violating Code
 16 22 section 321J.2, which prohibits the operation of a motor
 16 23 vehicle while under the influence of alcohol or a drug.
 16 24    RELEASE OF CONFIDENTIAL RECORDS.  The bill provides that a
 16 25 public record which is confidential under the provisions of
 16 26 Code chapter 232 shall only be subject to release upon order of
 16 27 a court in a proceeding under Code chapter 232.
 16 28    EXISTING CONFIDENTIALITY EXEMPTIONS.  The bill retains
 16 29 certain existing exemptions to confidentiality of juvenile
 16 30 court records. Pursuant to Code section 692A.121(8), records
 16 31 concerning sex offense convictions which are committed by
 16 32 minors may be released in the same manner as records of
 16 33 convictions of adults. Pursuant to Code section 915.10A,
 16 34 information concerning a juvenile charged with a felony offense
 16 35 may be released pursuant to an automated victim notification

 17  2 are not amended and therefore still apply to juvenile court
 17  3 records.
 17  4    RIGHT TO COUNSEL.  The bill in Code section 232.11 provides
 17  5 that a child has the right to be represented by counsel at a
 17  6 hearing on a confidentiality order under Code section 232.149A
 17  7 or a public records order under Code section 232.149B.

 13 23 from pleading or proving the adjudication at a subsequent
 13 24 criminal or delinquency proceeding for the purpose of penalty
 13 25 enhancement when a provision of the Code specifically deems the
 13 26 delinquency adjudication to constitute a final conviction.
 13 27    The bill in newly designated Code section 232.147(14)
 13 28 provides that the provisions of the bill shall not be construed
 13 29 to limit or restrict the production, use, or introduction
 13 30 of official juvenile court records in any juvenile or adult
 13 31 criminal proceeding, where such records are relevant and deemed
 13 32 admissible under any other provision of the law.
 13 33    CONFIDENTIALITY OF RECORDS AND FILES OF CRIMINAL OR
 13 34 JUVENILE JUSTICE AGENCIES.  Under current law, records and
 13 35 files of a criminal or juvenile justice agency concerning
 14  1 a child involved in a delinquent act are public records,
 14  2 subject to certain exceptions. The bill in Code section
 14  3 232.149 provides that the records and files of a criminal or

 14  5 officer concerning a child involved in a delinquent act are

 14  8 of a complaint or an informal adjustment of a complaint when
 14  9 no petition is filed relating to the complaint, shall not be

 14 22 delinquent act.
 14 23    PUBLIC RECORDS HEARINGS.  The bill enacts new Code section
 14 24 232.149B, which provides that a person may apply for a court
 14 25 order to make confidential juvenile court records public.
 14 26 The bill provides that a rebuttable presumption exists that
 14 27 official juvenile court records shall remain confidential. The
 14 28 bill provides that the court shall order the official juvenile
 14 29 court records in such a delinquency proceeding to be public
 14 30 records if either the public's interest in making the records
 14 31 public outweighs the juvenile's interest in maintaining the

 15  3 if the juvenile has been subsequently adjudicated delinquent
 15  4 for a public offense that would be a serious misdemeanor,
 15  5 aggravated misdemeanor, or felony offense if committed by an
 15  6 adult, or another delinquency proceeding is pending seeking
 15  7 such an adjudication. The bill provides that records subject
 15  8 to a public records order may be sealed at a later date
 15  9 pursuant to Code section 232.150.
 15 10    RIGHT TO REVIEW AND RELEASE A CONFIDENTIAL COMPLAINT.  The
 15 11 bill provides that delinquency complaints shall be released
 15 12 in accordance with Code section 915.25. Under current Code
 15 13 section 915.25, a complaint which alleges that a child who is
 15 14 at least 10 years of age committed a delinquent act, which if
 15 15 committed by an adult would be a public offense, is a public
 15 16 record. Current Code section 915.25 authorizes the court,
 15 17 its designee, or law enforcement officials to release such
 15 18 a complaint, including the identity of the child. The bill
 15 19 amends Code section 915.25 to provide that such a complaint
 15 20 is confidential unless the complaint alleges that the child
 15 21 committed a delinquent act that if committed by an adult would
 15 22 be a forcible felony. However, the bill authorizes state and

 15 24 against a child if the child is at large and doing so is deemed

 15 31    The bill provides that an intake or juvenile court officer
 15 32 shall disclose to the alleged victim of a delinquent act, upon
 15 33 request, the complaint, the name and address of the child who
 15 34 allegedly committed the delinquent act, and the disposition

 16  4    SEALING OF JUVENILE COURT RECORDS UNAVAILABLE FOR

 15 10    RIGHT TO REVIEW AND RELEASE A CONFIDENTIAL COMPLAINT.  The
 15 11 bill provides that delinquency complaints shall be released
 15 12 in accordance with Code section 915.25. Under current Code
 15 13 section 915.25, a complaint which alleges that a child who is
 15 14 at least 10 years of age committed a delinquent act, which if
 15 15 committed by an adult would be a public offense, is a public
 15 16 record. Current Code section 915.25 authorizes the court,
 15 17 its designee, or law enforcement officials to release such
 15 18 a complaint, including the identity of the child. The bill
 15 19 amends Code section 915.25 to provide that such a complaint
 15 20 is confidential unless the complaint alleges that the child
 15 21 committed a delinquent act that if committed by an adult would
 15 22 be a forcible felony. However, the bill authorizes state and
 15 23 local enforcement officials to release a confidential complaint
 15 24 against a child if the child is at large and doing so is deemed
 15 25 necessary for the protection of the public or the safety of
 15 26 the child. If the complaint is not confidential because the
 15 27 alleged delinquent act is an act that would be a forcible
 15 28 felony if committed by an adult, the court, its designee,
 15 29 or law enforcement officials may release such a complaint,
 15 30 including the identity of the child.
 15 31    The bill provides that an intake or juvenile court officer
 15 32 shall disclose to the alleged victim of a delinquent act, upon
 15 33 request, the complaint, the name and address of the child who
 15 34 allegedly committed the delinquent act, and the disposition
 15 35 of the complaint. If the alleged delinquent act would be
 16  1 a forcible felony if committed by an adult, the intake or
 16  2 juvenile court officer shall provide notification to the victim
 16  3 as required by Code section 915.24.
 16  4    SEALING OF JUVENILE COURT RECORDS UNAVAILABLE FOR
 16  5 OPERATING=WHILE=INTOXICATED VIOLATIONS.  Under current Code
 16  6 section 232.150, a court shall order juvenile court records
 16  7 to be sealed if the person who is the subject of the juvenile
 16  8 court records is 18 years of age or older and 2 years have
 16  9 elapsed since the last official action in the person's case,
 16 10 the person has not been subsequently convicted of a felony
 16 11 or an aggravated or serious misdemeanor or adjudicated a
 16 12 delinquent child for an act which if committed by an adult
 16 13 would be a felony, an aggravated misdemeanor, or a serious
 16 14 misdemeanor and no proceeding is pending seeking such
 16 15 conviction or adjudication, and the person was not placed on
 16 16 youthful offender status, transferred back to district court
 16 17 after the youthful offender's 18th birthday, and sentenced for
 16 18 the offense which precipitated the youthful offender placement.
 16 19 The bill in newly designated Code section 232.150(4) provides
 16 20 that the court shall not seal a person's juvenile court records
 16 21 if the person was adjudicated delinquent for violating Code
 16 22 section 321J.2, which prohibits the operation of a motor
 16 23 vehicle while under the influence of alcohol or a drug.
 16 24    RELEASE OF CONFIDENTIAL RECORDS.  The bill provides that a
 16 25 public record which is confidential under the provisions of
 16 26 Code chapter 232 shall only be subject to release upon order of
 16 27 a court in a proceeding under Code chapter 232.
 16 28    EXISTING CONFIDENTIALITY EXEMPTIONS.  The bill retains
 16 29 certain existing exemptions to confidentiality of juvenile
 16 30 court records. Pursuant to Code section 692A.121(8), records
 16 31 concerning sex offense convictions which are committed by
 16 32 minors may be released in the same manner as records of
 16 33 convictions of adults. Pursuant to Code section 915.10A,
 16 34 information concerning a juvenile charged with a felony offense
 16 35 may be released pursuant to an automated victim notification
 17  1 system. Under the bill, these exemptions to confidentiality
 17  2 are not amended and therefore still apply to juvenile court
 17  3 records.
 17  4    RIGHT TO COUNSEL.  The bill in Code section 232.11 provides
 17  5 that a child has the right to be represented by counsel at a
 17  6 hearing on a confidentiality order under Code section 232.149A
 17  7 or a public records order under Code section 232.149B.
 17  8    APPLICABILITY.  The bill applies to juvenile delinquency

 13 10    CONFIDENTIALITY OF TRANSCRIPTS.  The bill in newly
 13 11 designated Code section 232.147(3B) provides that if the court
 13 12 has excluded the public from a hearing pursuant to Code section
 13 13 232.39 or 232.92, the transcript of the proceedings shall not
 13 14 be deemed a public record and inspection and disclosure of
 13 15 the contents of the transcript shall not be permitted except

 13 17 chapter 232.
 13 18    USE OF ADJUDICATION OF DELINQUENCY FOR PENALTY ENHANCEMENTS
 13 19 OR EVIDENCE.  The bill in newly designated Code section
 13 20 232.147(13) provides that the confidentiality of a final
 13 21 adjudication of delinquency under Code section 232.147 or
 13 22 pursuant to Code section 232.149A shall not prohibit the state
 13 23 from pleading or proving the adjudication at a subsequent
 13 24 criminal or delinquency proceeding for the purpose of penalty
 13 25 enhancement when a provision of the Code specifically deems the
 13 26 delinquency adjudication to constitute a final conviction.
 13 27    The bill in newly designated Code section 232.147(14)
 13 28 provides that the provisions of the bill shall not be construed
 13 29 to limit or restrict the production, use, or introduction
 13 30 of official juvenile court records in any juvenile or adult
 13 31 criminal proceeding, where such records are relevant and deemed
 13 32 admissible under any other provision of the law.
 13 33    CONFIDENTIALITY OF RECORDS AND FILES OF CRIMINAL OR
 13 34 JUVENILE JUSTICE AGENCIES.  Under current law, records and
 13 35 files of a criminal or juvenile justice agency concerning
 14  1 a child involved in a delinquent act are public records,
 14  2 subject to certain exceptions. The bill in Code section
 14  3 232.149 provides that the records and files of a criminal or
 14  4 juvenile justice agency, an intake officer, or a juvenile court
 14  5 officer concerning a child involved in a delinquent act are
 14  6 confidential. The bill further provides that the records of an
 14  7 intake officer or juvenile court officer containing a dismissal
 14  8 of a complaint or an informal adjustment of a complaint when
 14  9 no petition is filed relating to the complaint, shall not be
 14 10 available to the public, but may be disclosed to the judge and
 14 11 professional court staff, including juvenile court officers;
 14 12 the child's counsel or guardian ad litem; the county attorney
 14 13 and county attorney's assistants;  the superintendent or the
 14 14 superintendent's designee of the school district for the
 14 15 school attended by the child or the authorities in charge of
 14 16 an accredited nonpublic school attended by the child; a member
 14 17 of the armed forces of the United States who is conducting a
 14 18 background investigation of an individual pursuant to federal
 14 19 law; the statistical analysis center for the purposes stated
 14 20 in Code section 216A.136; the state public defender;  the
 14 21 department of human services; and the alleged victim of the
 14 22 delinquent act.
 14 23    PUBLIC RECORDS HEARINGS.  The bill enacts new Code section
 14 24 232.149B, which provides that a person may apply for a court
 14 25 order to make confidential juvenile court records public.
 14 26 The bill provides that a rebuttable presumption exists that
 14 27 official juvenile court records shall remain confidential. The
 14 28 bill provides that the court shall order the official juvenile
 14 29 court records in such a delinquency proceeding to be public
 14 30 records if either the public's interest in making the records
 14 31 public outweighs the juvenile's interest in maintaining the
 14 32 confidentiality of the records or the juvenile has been placed
 14 33 on youthful offender status pursuant to Code section 232.45(7)
 14 34 and Code section 907.3A(1), and will be transferred back to
 14 35 the district court for sentencing prior to the child's 18th
 15  1 birthday. The court may order the official juvenile court
 15  2 records in such a delinquency proceeding to be public records
 15  3 if the juvenile has been subsequently adjudicated delinquent
 15  4 for a public offense that would be a serious misdemeanor,
 15  5 aggravated misdemeanor, or felony offense if committed by an
 15  6 adult, or another delinquency proceeding is pending seeking
 15  7 such an adjudication. The bill provides that records subject
 15  8 to a public records order may be sealed at a later date
 15  9 pursuant to Code section 232.150.
 15 10    RIGHT TO REVIEW AND RELEASE A CONFIDENTIAL COMPLAINT.  The
 15 11 bill provides that delinquency complaints shall be released
 15 12 in accordance with Code section 915.25. Under current Code
 15 13 section 915.25, a complaint which alleges that a child who is
 15 14 at least 10 years of age committed a delinquent act, which if
 15 15 committed by an adult would be a public offense, is a public
 15 16 record. Current Code section 915.25 authorizes the court,
 15 17 its designee, or law enforcement officials to release such
 15 18 a complaint, including the identity of the child. The bill
 15 19 amends Code section 915.25 to provide that such a complaint
 15 20 is confidential unless the complaint alleges that the child
 15 21 committed a delinquent act that if committed by an adult would
 15 22 be a forcible felony. However, the bill authorizes state and
 15 23 local enforcement officials to release a confidential complaint
 15 24 against a child if the child is at large and doing so is deemed
 15 25 necessary for the protection of the public or the safety of
 15 26 the child. If the complaint is not confidential because the
 15 27 alleged delinquent act is an act that would be a forcible
 15 28 felony if committed by an adult, the court, its designee,
 15 29 or law enforcement officials may release such a complaint,
 15 30 including the identity of the child.
 15 31    The bill provides that an intake or juvenile court officer
 15 32 shall disclose to the alleged victim of a delinquent act, upon
 15 33 request, the complaint, the name and address of the child who
 15 34 allegedly committed the delinquent act, and the disposition
 15 35 of the complaint. If the alleged delinquent act would be

 16  2 juvenile court officer shall provide notification to the victim
 16  3 as required by Code section 915.24.
 16  4    SEALING OF JUVENILE COURT RECORDS UNAVAILABLE FOR

 16 13 would be a felony, an aggravated misdemeanor, or a serious
 16 14 misdemeanor and no proceeding is pending seeking such
 16 15 conviction or adjudication, and the person was not placed on
 16 16 youthful offender status, transferred back to district court
 16 17 after the youthful offender's 18th birthday, and sentenced for
 16 18 the offense which precipitated the youthful offender placement.
 16 19 The bill in newly designated Code section 232.150(4) provides

 16 22 section 321J.2, which prohibits the operation of a motor

 14  6 confidential. The bill further provides that the records of an
 14  7 intake officer or juvenile court officer containing a dismissal
 14  8 of a complaint or an informal adjustment of a complaint when
 14  9 no petition is filed relating to the complaint, shall not be
 14 10 available to the public, but may be disclosed to the judge and
 14 11 professional court staff, including juvenile court officers;
 14 12 the child's counsel or guardian ad litem; the county attorney
 14 13 and county attorney's assistants;  the superintendent or the
 14 14 superintendent's designee of the school district for the
 14 15 school attended by the child or the authorities in charge of
 14 16 an accredited nonpublic school attended by the child; a member
 14 17 of the armed forces of the United States who is conducting a
 14 18 background investigation of an individual pursuant to federal
 14 19 law; the statistical analysis center for the purposes stated
 14 20 in Code section 216A.136; the state public defender;  the
 14 21 department of human services; and the alleged victim of the
 14 22 delinquent act.
 14 23    PUBLIC RECORDS HEARINGS.  The bill enacts new Code section
 14 24 232.149B, which provides that a person may apply for a court
 14 25 order to make confidential juvenile court records public.
 14 26 The bill provides that a rebuttable presumption exists that
 14 27 official juvenile court records shall remain confidential. The
 14 28 bill provides that the court shall order the official juvenile
 14 29 court records in such a delinquency proceeding to be public
 14 30 records if either the public's interest in making the records
 14 31 public outweighs the juvenile's interest in maintaining the
 14 32 confidentiality of the records or the juvenile has been placed
 14 33 on youthful offender status pursuant to Code section 232.45(7)
 14 34 and Code section 907.3A(1), and will be transferred back to
 14 35 the district court for sentencing prior to the child's 18th
 15  1 birthday. The court may order the official juvenile court
 15  2 records in such a delinquency proceeding to be public records
 15  3 if the juvenile has been subsequently adjudicated delinquent
 15  4 for a public offense that would be a serious misdemeanor,
 15  5 aggravated misdemeanor, or felony offense if committed by an
 15  6 adult, or another delinquency proceeding is pending seeking
 15  7 such an adjudication. The bill provides that records subject
 15  8 to a public records order may be sealed at a later date
 15  9 pursuant to Code section 232.150.
 15 10    RIGHT TO REVIEW AND RELEASE A CONFIDENTIAL COMPLAINT.  The
 15 11 bill provides that delinquency complaints shall be released
 15 12 in accordance with Code section 915.25. Under current Code
 15 13 section 915.25, a complaint which alleges that a child who is
 15 14 at least 10 years of age committed a delinquent act, which if
 15 15 committed by an adult would be a public offense, is a public
 15 16 record. Current Code section 915.25 authorizes the court,
 15 17 its designee, or law enforcement officials to release such
 15 18 a complaint, including the identity of the child. The bill
 15 19 amends Code section 915.25 to provide that such a complaint
 15 20 is confidential unless the complaint alleges that the child
 15 21 committed a delinquent act that if committed by an adult would
 15 22 be a forcible felony. However, the bill authorizes state and
 15 23 local enforcement officials to release a confidential complaint
 15 24 against a child if the child is at large and doing so is deemed
 15 25 necessary for the protection of the public or the safety of
 15 26 the child. If the complaint is not confidential because the
 15 27 alleged delinquent act is an act that would be a forcible
 15 28 felony if committed by an adult, the court, its designee,
 15 29 or law enforcement officials may release such a complaint,
 15 30 including the identity of the child.
 15 31    The bill provides that an intake or juvenile court officer
 15 32 shall disclose to the alleged victim of a delinquent act, upon
 15 33 request, the complaint, the name and address of the child who
 15 34 allegedly committed the delinquent act, and the disposition
 15 35 of the complaint. If the alleged delinquent act would be
 16  1 a forcible felony if committed by an adult, the intake or
 16  2 juvenile court officer shall provide notification to the victim
 16  3 as required by Code section 915.24.
 16  4    SEALING OF JUVENILE COURT RECORDS UNAVAILABLE FOR
 16  5 OPERATING=WHILE=INTOXICATED VIOLATIONS.  Under current Code
 16  6 section 232.150, a court shall order juvenile court records
 16  7 to be sealed if the person who is the subject of the juvenile
 16  8 court records is 18 years of age or older and 2 years have
 16  9 elapsed since the last official action in the person's case,
 16 10 the person has not been subsequently convicted of a felony
 16 11 or an aggravated or serious misdemeanor or adjudicated a
 16 12 delinquent child for an act which if committed by an adult
 16 13 would be a felony, an aggravated misdemeanor, or a serious
 16 14 misdemeanor and no proceeding is pending seeking such
 16 15 conviction or adjudication, and the person was not placed on
 16 16 youthful offender status, transferred back to district court
 16 17 after the youthful offender's 18th birthday, and sentenced for
 16 18 the offense which precipitated the youthful offender placement.
 16 19 The bill in newly designated Code section 232.150(4) provides
 16 20 that the court shall not seal a person's juvenile court records
 16 21 if the person was adjudicated delinquent for violating Code
 16 22 section 321J.2, which prohibits the operation of a motor
 16 23 vehicle while under the influence of alcohol or a drug.
 16 24    RELEASE OF CONFIDENTIAL RECORDS.  The bill provides that a
 16 25 public record which is confidential under the provisions of
 16 26 Code chapter 232 shall only be subject to release upon order of
 16 27 a court in a proceeding under Code chapter 232.
 16 28    EXISTING CONFIDENTIALITY EXEMPTIONS.  The bill retains
 16 29 certain existing exemptions to confidentiality of juvenile
 16 30 court records. Pursuant to Code section 692A.121(8), records
 16 31 concerning sex offense convictions which are committed by
 16 32 minors may be released in the same manner as records of
 16 33 convictions of adults. Pursuant to Code section 915.10A,
 16 34 information concerning a juvenile charged with a felony offense
 16 35 may be released pursuant to an automated victim notification
 17  1 system. Under the bill, these exemptions to confidentiality
 17  2 are not amended and therefore still apply to juvenile court
 17  3 records.
 17  4    RIGHT TO COUNSEL.  The bill in Code section 232.11 provides
 17  5 that a child has the right to be represented by counsel at a
 17  6 hearing on a confidentiality order under Code section 232.149A
 17  7 or a public records order under Code section 232.149B.
 17  8    APPLICABILITY.  The bill applies to juvenile delinquency
 17  9 proceedings which are pending or arise on or after July 1,

 13 10    CONFIDENTIALITY OF TRANSCRIPTS.  The bill in newly
 13 11 designated Code section 232.147(3B) provides that if the court
 13 12 has excluded the public from a hearing pursuant to Code section
 13 13 232.39 or 232.92, the transcript of the proceedings shall not
 13 14 be deemed a public record and inspection and disclosure of
 13 15 the contents of the transcript shall not be permitted except
 13 16 pursuant to a court order or unless otherwise provided in Code
 13 17 chapter 232.
 13 18    USE OF ADJUDICATION OF DELINQUENCY FOR PENALTY ENHANCEMENTS
 13 19 OR EVIDENCE.  The bill in newly designated Code section
 13 20 232.147(13) provides that the confidentiality of a final
 13 21 adjudication of delinquency under Code section 232.147 or
 13 22 pursuant to Code section 232.149A shall not prohibit the state
 13 23 from pleading or proving the adjudication at a subsequent
 13 24 criminal or delinquency proceeding for the purpose of penalty
 13 25 enhancement when a provision of the Code specifically deems the
 13 26 delinquency adjudication to constitute a final conviction.
 13 27    The bill in newly designated Code section 232.147(14)
 13 28 provides that the provisions of the bill shall not be construed
 13 29 to limit or restrict the production, use, or introduction
 13 30 of official juvenile court records in any juvenile or adult
 13 31 criminal proceeding, where such records are relevant and deemed
 13 32 admissible under any other provision of the law.
 13 33    CONFIDENTIALITY OF RECORDS AND FILES OF CRIMINAL OR
 13 34 JUVENILE JUSTICE AGENCIES.  Under current law, records and
 13 35 files of a criminal or juvenile justice agency concerning
 14  1 a child involved in a delinquent act are public records,
 14  2 subject to certain exceptions. The bill in Code section
 14  3 232.149 provides that the records and files of a criminal or
 14  4 juvenile justice agency, an intake officer, or a juvenile court
 14  5 officer concerning a child involved in a delinquent act are
 14  6 confidential. The bill further provides that the records of an
 14  7 intake officer or juvenile court officer containing a dismissal
 14  8 of a complaint or an informal adjustment of a complaint when
 14  9 no petition is filed relating to the complaint, shall not be
 14 10 available to the public, but may be disclosed to the judge and
 14 11 professional court staff, including juvenile court officers;
 14 12 the child's counsel or guardian ad litem; the county attorney
 14 13 and county attorney's assistants;  the superintendent or the
 14 14 superintendent's designee of the school district for the
 14 15 school attended by the child or the authorities in charge of
 14 16 an accredited nonpublic school attended by the child; a member
 14 17 of the armed forces of the United States who is conducting a
 14 18 background investigation of an individual pursuant to federal
 14 19 law; the statistical analysis center for the purposes stated
 14 20 in Code section 216A.136; the state public defender;  the
 14 21 department of human services; and the alleged victim of the
 14 22 delinquent act.
 14 23    PUBLIC RECORDS HEARINGS.  The bill enacts new Code section
 14 24 232.149B, which provides that a person may apply for a court
 14 25 order to make confidential juvenile court records public.
 14 26 The bill provides that a rebuttable presumption exists that
 14 27 official juvenile court records shall remain confidential. The
 14 28 bill provides that the court shall order the official juvenile
 14 29 court records in such a delinquency proceeding to be public
 14 30 records if either the public's interest in making the records
 14 31 public outweighs the juvenile's interest in maintaining the
 14 32 confidentiality of the records or the juvenile has been placed
 14 33 on youthful offender status pursuant to Code section 232.45(7)
 14 34 and Code section 907.3A(1), and will be transferred back to
 14 35 the district court for sentencing prior to the child's 18th
 15  1 birthday. The court may order the official juvenile court
 15  2 records in such a delinquency proceeding to be public records
 15  3 if the juvenile has been subsequently adjudicated delinquent
 15  4 for a public offense that would be a serious misdemeanor,
 15  5 aggravated misdemeanor, or felony offense if committed by an
 15  6 adult, or another delinquency proceeding is pending seeking
 15  7 such an adjudication. The bill provides that records subject
 15  8 to a public records order may be sealed at a later date
 15  9 pursuant to Code section 232.150.
 15 10    RIGHT TO REVIEW AND RELEASE A CONFIDENTIAL COMPLAINT.  The
 15 11 bill provides that delinquency complaints shall be released
 15 12 in accordance with Code section 915.25. Under current Code
 15 13 section 915.25, a complaint which alleges that a child who is
 15 14 at least 10 years of age committed a delinquent act, which if
 15 15 committed by an adult would be a public offense, is a public
 15 16 record. Current Code section 915.25 authorizes the court,
 15 17 its designee, or law enforcement officials to release such
 15 18 a complaint, including the identity of the child. The bill
 15 19 amends Code section 915.25 to provide that such a complaint
 15 20 is confidential unless the complaint alleges that the child
 15 21 committed a delinquent act that if committed by an adult would
 15 22 be a forcible felony. However, the bill authorizes state and
 15 23 local enforcement officials to release a confidential complaint
 15 24 against a child if the child is at large and doing so is deemed
 15 25 necessary for the protection of the public or the safety of
 15 26 the child. If the complaint is not confidential because the
 15 27 alleged delinquent act is an act that would be a forcible
 15 28 felony if committed by an adult, the court, its designee,
 15 29 or law enforcement officials may release such a complaint,
 15 30 including the identity of the child.
 15 31    The bill provides that an intake or juvenile court officer
 15 32 shall disclose to the alleged victim of a delinquent act, upon
 15 33 request, the complaint, the name and address of the child who
 15 34 allegedly committed the delinquent act, and the disposition
 15 35 of the complaint. If the alleged delinquent act would be
 16  1 a forcible felony if committed by an adult, the intake or
 16  2 juvenile court officer shall provide notification to the victim
 16  3 as required by Code section 915.24.
 16  4    SEALING OF JUVENILE COURT RECORDS UNAVAILABLE FOR
 16  5 OPERATING=WHILE=INTOXICATED VIOLATIONS.  Under current Code
 16  6 section 232.150, a court shall order juvenile court records
 16  7 to be sealed if the person who is the subject of the juvenile
 16  8 court records is 18 years of age or older and 2 years have
 16  9 elapsed since the last official action in the person's case,
 16 10 the person has not been subsequently convicted of a felony
 16 11 or an aggravated or serious misdemeanor or adjudicated a
 16 12 delinquent child for an act which if committed by an adult
 16 13 would be a felony, an aggravated misdemeanor, or a serious
 16 14 misdemeanor and no proceeding is pending seeking such
 16 15 conviction or adjudication, and the person was not placed on
 16 16 youthful offender status, transferred back to district court
 16 17 after the youthful offender's 18th birthday, and sentenced for
 16 18 the offense which precipitated the youthful offender placement.
 16 19 The bill in newly designated Code section 232.150(4) provides
 16 20 that the court shall not seal a person's juvenile court records
 16 21 if the person was adjudicated delinquent for violating Code
 16 22 section 321J.2, which prohibits the operation of a motor
 16 23 vehicle while under the influence of alcohol or a drug.
 16 24    RELEASE OF CONFIDENTIAL RECORDS.  The bill provides that a
 16 25 public record which is confidential under the provisions of
 16 26 Code chapter 232 shall only be subject to release upon order of
 16 27 a court in a proceeding under Code chapter 232.
 16 28    EXISTING CONFIDENTIALITY EXEMPTIONS.  The bill retains
 16 29 certain existing exemptions to confidentiality of juvenile

 13 33    CONFIDENTIALITY OF RECORDS AND FILES OF CRIMINAL OR
 13 34 JUVENILE JUSTICE AGENCIES.  Under current law, records and
 13 35 files of a criminal or juvenile justice agency concerning
 14  1 a child involved in a delinquent act are public records,
 14  2 subject to certain exceptions. The bill in Code section
 14  3 232.149 provides that the records and files of a criminal or
 14  4 juvenile justice agency, an intake officer, or a juvenile court
 14  5 officer concerning a child involved in a delinquent act are

 14 25 order to make confidential juvenile court records public.
 14 26 The bill provides that a rebuttable presumption exists that
 14 27 official juvenile court records shall remain confidential. The

 14 29 court records in such a delinquency proceeding to be public
 14 30 records if either the public's interest in making the records
 14 31 public outweighs the juvenile's interest in maintaining the

 14 33 on youthful offender status pursuant to Code section 232.45(7)
 14 34 and Code section 907.3A(1), and will be transferred back to
 14 35 the district court for sentencing prior to the child's 18th

 15  2 records in such a delinquency proceeding to be public records
 15  3 if the juvenile has been subsequently adjudicated delinquent
 15  4 for a public offense that would be a serious misdemeanor,
 15  5 aggravated misdemeanor, or felony offense if committed by an

 15  7 such an adjudication. The bill provides that records subject
 15  8 to a public records order may be sealed at a later date
 15  9 pursuant to Code section 232.150.
 15 10    RIGHT TO REVIEW AND RELEASE A CONFIDENTIAL COMPLAINT.  The
 15 11 bill provides that delinquency complaints shall be released
 15 12 in accordance with Code section 915.25. Under current Code
 15 13 section 915.25, a complaint which alleges that a child who is
 15 14 at least 10 years of age committed a delinquent act, which if
 15 15 committed by an adult would be a public offense, is a public
 15 16 record. Current Code section 915.25 authorizes the court,
 15 17 its designee, or law enforcement officials to release such
 15 18 a complaint, including the identity of the child. The bill
 15 19 amends Code section 915.25 to provide that such a complaint
 15 20 is confidential unless the complaint alleges that the child
 15 21 committed a delinquent act that if committed by an adult would
 15 22 be a forcible felony. However, the bill authorizes state and

 15 24 against a child if the child is at large and doing so is deemed

 16  3 as required by Code section 915.24.
 16  4    SEALING OF JUVENILE COURT RECORDS UNAVAILABLE FOR
 16  5 OPERATING=WHILE=INTOXICATED VIOLATIONS.  Under current Code
 16  6 section 232.150, a court shall order juvenile court records
 16  7 to be sealed if the person who is the subject of the juvenile
 16  8 court records is 18 years of age or older and 2 years have
 16  9 elapsed since the last official action in the person's case,
 16 10 the person has not been subsequently convicted of a felony

 16 12 delinquent child for an act which if committed by an adult
 16 13 would be a felony, an aggravated misdemeanor, or a serious

 16 15 conviction or adjudication, and the person was not placed on
 16 16 youthful offender status, transferred back to district court
 16 17 after the youthful offender's 18th birthday, and sentenced for
 16 18 the offense which precipitated the youthful offender placement.
 16 19 The bill in newly designated Code section 232.150(4) provides
 16 20 that the court shall not seal a person's juvenile court records
 16 21 if the person was adjudicated delinquent for violating Code
 16 22 section 321J.2, which prohibits the operation of a motor

 13 12 has excluded the public from a hearing pursuant to Code section
 13 13 232.39 or 232.92, the transcript of the proceedings shall not
 13 14 be deemed a public record and inspection and disclosure of
 13 15 the contents of the transcript shall not be permitted except
 13 16 pursuant to a court order or unless otherwise provided in Code
 13 17 chapter 232.
 13 18    USE OF ADJUDICATION OF DELINQUENCY FOR PENALTY ENHANCEMENTS
 13 19 OR EVIDENCE.  The bill in newly designated Code section
 13 20 232.147(13) provides that the confidentiality of a final
 13 21 adjudication of delinquency under Code section 232.147 or
 13 22 pursuant to Code section 232.149A shall not prohibit the state
 13 23 from pleading or proving the adjudication at a subsequent
 13 24 criminal or delinquency proceeding for the purpose of penalty
 13 25 enhancement when a provision of the Code specifically deems the
 13 26 delinquency adjudication to constitute a final conviction.
 13 27    The bill in newly designated Code section 232.147(14)
 13 28 provides that the provisions of the bill shall not be construed
 13 29 to limit or restrict the production, use, or introduction
 13 30 of official juvenile court records in any juvenile or adult
 13 31 criminal proceeding, where such records are relevant and deemed
 13 32 admissible under any other provision of the law.
 13 33    CONFIDENTIALITY OF RECORDS AND FILES OF CRIMINAL OR
 13 34 JUVENILE JUSTICE AGENCIES.  Under current law, records and
 13 35 files of a criminal or juvenile justice agency concerning
 14  1 a child involved in a delinquent act are public records,
 14  2 subject to certain exceptions. The bill in Code section
 14  3 232.149 provides that the records and files of a criminal or
 14  4 juvenile justice agency, an intake officer, or a juvenile court
 14  5 officer concerning a child involved in a delinquent act are
 14  6 confidential. The bill further provides that the records of an
 14  7 intake officer or juvenile court officer containing a dismissal
 14  8 of a complaint or an informal adjustment of a complaint when
 14  9 no petition is filed relating to the complaint, shall not be
 14 10 available to the public, but may be disclosed to the judge and
 14 11 professional court staff, including juvenile court officers;
 14 12 the child's counsel or guardian ad litem; the county attorney
 14 13 and county attorney's assistants;  the superintendent or the
 14 14 superintendent's designee of the school district for the
 14 15 school attended by the child or the authorities in charge of
 14 16 an accredited nonpublic school attended by the child; a member
 14 17 of the armed forces of the United States who is conducting a
 14 18 background investigation of an individual pursuant to federal
 14 19 law; the statistical analysis center for the purposes stated
 14 20 in Code section 216A.136; the state public defender;  the
 14 21 department of human services; and the alleged victim of the
 14 22 delinquent act.
 14 23    PUBLIC RECORDS HEARINGS.  The bill enacts new Code section
 14 24 232.149B, which provides that a person may apply for a court
 14 25 order to make confidential juvenile court records public.
 14 26 The bill provides that a rebuttable presumption exists that
 14 27 official juvenile court records shall remain confidential. The
 14 28 bill provides that the court shall order the official juvenile
 14 29 court records in such a delinquency proceeding to be public
 14 30 records if either the public's interest in making the records
 14 31 public outweighs the juvenile's interest in maintaining the
 14 32 confidentiality of the records or the juvenile has been placed
 14 33 on youthful offender status pursuant to Code section 232.45(7)
 14 34 and Code section 907.3A(1), and will be transferred back to
 14 35 the district court for sentencing prior to the child's 18th
 15  1 birthday. The court may order the official juvenile court
 15  2 records in such a delinquency proceeding to be public records
 15  3 if the juvenile has been subsequently adjudicated delinquent
 15  4 for a public offense that would be a serious misdemeanor,
 15  5 aggravated misdemeanor, or felony offense if committed by an
 15  6 adult, or another delinquency proceeding is pending seeking
 15  7 such an adjudication. The bill provides that records subject
 15  8 to a public records order may be sealed at a later date
 15  9 pursuant to Code section 232.150.
 15 10    RIGHT TO REVIEW AND RELEASE A CONFIDENTIAL COMPLAINT.  The
 15 11 bill provides that delinquency complaints shall be released
 15 12 in accordance with Code section 915.25. Under current Code
 15 13 section 915.25, a complaint which alleges that a child who is
 15 14 at least 10 years of age committed a delinquent act, which if
 15 15 committed by an adult would be a public offense, is a public
 15 16 record. Current Code section 915.25 authorizes the court,
 15 17 its designee, or law enforcement officials to release such
 15 18 a complaint, including the identity of the child. The bill
 15 19 amends Code section 915.25 to provide that such a complaint
 15 20 is confidential unless the complaint alleges that the child
 15 21 committed a delinquent act that if committed by an adult would
 15 22 be a forcible felony. However, the bill authorizes state and
 15 23 local enforcement officials to release a confidential complaint
 15 24 against a child if the child is at large and doing so is deemed
 15 25 necessary for the protection of the public or the safety of
 15 26 the child. If the complaint is not confidential because the
 15 27 alleged delinquent act is an act that would be a forcible
 15 28 felony if committed by an adult, the court, its designee,
 15 29 or law enforcement officials may release such a complaint,
 15 30 including the identity of the child.
 15 31    The bill provides that an intake or juvenile court officer
 15 32 shall disclose to the alleged victim of a delinquent act, upon
 15 33 request, the complaint, the name and address of the child who
 15 34 allegedly committed the delinquent act, and the disposition
 15 35 of the complaint. If the alleged delinquent act would be
 16  1 a forcible felony if committed by an adult, the intake or
 16  2 juvenile court officer shall provide notification to the victim
 16  3 as required by Code section 915.24.
 16  4    SEALING OF JUVENILE COURT RECORDS UNAVAILABLE FOR
 16  5 OPERATING=WHILE=INTOXICATED VIOLATIONS.  Under current Code
 16  6 section 232.150, a court shall order juvenile court records
 16  7 to be sealed if the person who is the subject of the juvenile
 16  8 court records is 18 years of age or older and 2 years have
 16  9 elapsed since the last official action in the person's case,
 16 10 the person has not been subsequently convicted of a felony
 16 11 or an aggravated or serious misdemeanor or adjudicated a
 16 12 delinquent child for an act which if committed by an adult
 16 13 would be a felony, an aggravated misdemeanor, or a serious
 16 14 misdemeanor and no proceeding is pending seeking such
 16 15 conviction or adjudication, and the person was not placed on
 16 16 youthful offender status, transferred back to district court
 16 17 after the youthful offender's 18th birthday, and sentenced for
 16 18 the offense which precipitated the youthful offender placement.
 16 19 The bill in newly designated Code section 232.150(4) provides
 16 20 that the court shall not seal a person's juvenile court records
 16 21 if the person was adjudicated delinquent for violating Code
 16 22 section 321J.2, which prohibits the operation of a motor
 16 23 vehicle while under the influence of alcohol or a drug.
 16 24    RELEASE OF CONFIDENTIAL RECORDS.  The bill provides that a
 16 25 public record which is confidential under the provisions of
 16 26 Code chapter 232 shall only be subject to release upon order of
 16 27 a court in a proceeding under Code chapter 232.
 16 28    EXISTING CONFIDENTIALITY EXEMPTIONS.  The bill retains
 16 29 certain existing exemptions to confidentiality of juvenile
 16 30 court records. Pursuant to Code section 692A.121(8), records
 16 31 concerning sex offense convictions which are committed by
 16 32 minors may be released in the same manner as records of
 16 33 convictions of adults. Pursuant to Code section 915.10A,
 16 34 information concerning a juvenile charged with a felony offense
 16 35 may be released pursuant to an automated victim notification
 17  1 system. Under the bill, these exemptions to confidentiality
 17  2 are not amended and therefore still apply to juvenile court
 17  3 records.
 17  4    RIGHT TO COUNSEL.  The bill in Code section 232.11 provides
 17  5 that a child has the right to be represented by counsel at a
 17  6 hearing on a confidentiality order under Code section 232.149A
 17  7 or a public records order under Code section 232.149B.
 17  8    APPLICABILITY.  The bill applies to juvenile delinquency
 17  9 proceedings which are pending or arise on or after July 1,
 17 10 2016.

 13 14 be deemed a public record and inspection and disclosure of

 13 19 OR EVIDENCE.  The bill in newly designated Code section
 13 20 232.147(13) provides that the confidentiality of a final
 13 21 adjudication of delinquency under Code section 232.147 or

 13 23 from pleading or proving the adjudication at a subsequent
 13 24 criminal or delinquency proceeding for the purpose of penalty
 13 25 enhancement when a provision of the Code specifically deems the
 13 26 delinquency adjudication to constitute a final conviction.
 13 27    The bill in newly designated Code section 232.147(14)
 13 28 provides that the provisions of the bill shall not be construed
 13 29 to limit or restrict the production, use, or introduction
 13 30 of official juvenile court records in any juvenile or adult
 13 31 criminal proceeding, where such records are relevant and deemed
 13 32 admissible under any other provision of the law.
 13 33    CONFIDENTIALITY OF RECORDS AND FILES OF CRIMINAL OR
 13 34 JUVENILE JUSTICE AGENCIES.  Under current law, records and
 13 35 files of a criminal or juvenile justice agency concerning

 14  3 232.149 provides that the records and files of a criminal or
 14  4 juvenile justice agency, an intake officer, or a juvenile court
 14  5 officer concerning a child involved in a delinquent act are
 14  6 confidential. The bill further provides that the records of an
 14  7 intake officer or juvenile court officer containing a dismissal
 14  8 of a complaint or an informal adjustment of a complaint when
 14  9 no petition is filed relating to the complaint, shall not be
 14 10 available to the public, but may be disclosed to the judge and
 14 11 professional court staff, including juvenile court officers;
 14 12 the child's counsel or guardian ad litem; the county attorney
 14 13 and county attorney's assistants;  the superintendent or the

 14 27 official juvenile court records shall remain confidential. The
 14 28 bill provides that the court shall order the official juvenile
 14 29 court records in such a delinquency proceeding to be public
 14 30 records if either the public's interest in making the records
 14 31 public outweighs the juvenile's interest in maintaining the
 14 32 confidentiality of the records or the juvenile has been placed
 14 33 on youthful offender status pursuant to Code section 232.45(7)
 14 34 and Code section 907.3A(1), and will be transferred back to
 14 35 the district court for sentencing prior to the child's 18th
 15  1 birthday. The court may order the official juvenile court
 15  2 records in such a delinquency proceeding to be public records
 15  3 if the juvenile has been subsequently adjudicated delinquent
 15  4 for a public offense that would be a serious misdemeanor,
 15  5 aggravated misdemeanor, or felony offense if committed by an
 15  6 adult, or another delinquency proceeding is pending seeking
 15  7 such an adjudication. The bill provides that records subject

 15 14 at least 10 years of age committed a delinquent act, which if
 15 15 committed by an adult would be a public offense, is a public
 15 16 record. Current Code section 915.25 authorizes the court,
 15 17 its designee, or law enforcement officials to release such
 15 18 a complaint, including the identity of the child. The bill
 15 19 amends Code section 915.25 to provide that such a complaint
 15 20 is confidential unless the complaint alleges that the child
 15 21 committed a delinquent act that if committed by an adult would
 15 22 be a forcible felony. However, the bill authorizes state and

 16 26 Code chapter 232 shall only be subject to release upon order of
 16 27 a court in a proceeding under Code chapter 232.
 16 28    EXISTING CONFIDENTIALITY EXEMPTIONS.  The bill retains
 16 29 certain existing exemptions to confidentiality of juvenile
 16 30 court records. Pursuant to Code section 692A.121(8), records
 16 31 concerning sex offense convictions which are committed by
 16 32 minors may be released in the same manner as records of
 16 33 convictions of adults. Pursuant to Code section 915.10A,
 16 34 information concerning a juvenile charged with a felony offense
 16 35 may be released pursuant to an automated victim notification
 17  1 system. Under the bill, these exemptions to confidentiality
 17  2 are not amended and therefore still apply to juvenile court
 17  3 records.
 17  4    RIGHT TO COUNSEL.  The bill in Code section 232.11 provides
 17  5 that a child has the right to be represented by counsel at a
 17  6 hearing on a confidentiality order under Code section 232.149A
 17  7 or a public records order under Code section 232.149B.
 17  8    APPLICABILITY.  The bill applies to juvenile delinquency
 17  9 proceedings which are pending or arise on or after July 1,

 13 18    USE OF ADJUDICATION OF DELINQUENCY FOR PENALTY ENHANCEMENTS
 13 19 OR EVIDENCE.  The bill in newly designated Code section
 13 20 232.147(13) provides that the confidentiality of a final
 13 21 adjudication of delinquency under Code section 232.147 or
 13 22 pursuant to Code section 232.149A shall not prohibit the state
 13 23 from pleading or proving the adjudication at a subsequent
 13 24 criminal or delinquency proceeding for the purpose of penalty
 13 25 enhancement when a provision of the Code specifically deems the
 13 26 delinquency adjudication to constitute a final conviction.
 13 27    The bill in newly designated Code section 232.147(14)
 13 28 provides that the provisions of the bill shall not be construed
 13 29 to limit or restrict the production, use, or introduction
 13 30 of official juvenile court records in any juvenile or adult
 13 31 criminal proceeding, where such records are relevant and deemed
 13 32 admissible under any other provision of the law.
 13 33    CONFIDENTIALITY OF RECORDS AND FILES OF CRIMINAL OR
 13 34 JUVENILE JUSTICE AGENCIES.  Under current law, records and
 13 35 files of a criminal or juvenile justice agency concerning
 14  1 a child involved in a delinquent act are public records,
 14  2 subject to certain exceptions. The bill in Code section
 14  3 232.149 provides that the records and files of a criminal or
 14  4 juvenile justice agency, an intake officer, or a juvenile court
 14  5 officer concerning a child involved in a delinquent act are
 14  6 confidential. The bill further provides that the records of an
 14  7 intake officer or juvenile court officer containing a dismissal
 14  8 of a complaint or an informal adjustment of a complaint when
 14  9 no petition is filed relating to the complaint, shall not be
 14 10 available to the public, but may be disclosed to the judge and
 14 11 professional court staff, including juvenile court officers;
 14 12 the child's counsel or guardian ad litem; the county attorney
 14 13 and county attorney's assistants;  the superintendent or the
 14 14 superintendent's designee of the school district for the
 14 15 school attended by the child or the authorities in charge of
 14 16 an accredited nonpublic school attended by the child; a member
 14 17 of the armed forces of the United States who is conducting a
 14 18 background investigation of an individual pursuant to federal
 14 19 law; the statistical analysis center for the purposes stated
 14 20 in Code section 216A.136; the state public defender;  the
 14 21 department of human services; and the alleged victim of the
 14 22 delinquent act.
 14 23    PUBLIC RECORDS HEARINGS.  The bill enacts new Code section
 14 24 232.149B, which provides that a person may apply for a court
 14 25 order to make confidential juvenile court records public.
 14 26 The bill provides that a rebuttable presumption exists that
 14 27 official juvenile court records shall remain confidential. The
 14 28 bill provides that the court shall order the official juvenile
 14 29 court records in such a delinquency proceeding to be public
 14 30 records if either the public's interest in making the records
 14 31 public outweighs the juvenile's interest in maintaining the
 14 32 confidentiality of the records or the juvenile has been placed
 14 33 on youthful offender status pursuant to Code section 232.45(7)
 14 34 and Code section 907.3A(1), and will be transferred back to
 14 35 the district court for sentencing prior to the child's 18th
 15  1 birthday. The court may order the official juvenile court
 15  2 records in such a delinquency proceeding to be public records
 15  3 if the juvenile has been subsequently adjudicated delinquent
 15  4 for a public offense that would be a serious misdemeanor,
 15  5 aggravated misdemeanor, or felony offense if committed by an
 15  6 adult, or another delinquency proceeding is pending seeking
 15  7 such an adjudication. The bill provides that records subject
 15  8 to a public records order may be sealed at a later date
 15  9 pursuant to Code section 232.150.
 15 10    RIGHT TO REVIEW AND RELEASE A CONFIDENTIAL COMPLAINT.  The
 15 11 bill provides that delinquency complaints shall be released
 15 12 in accordance with Code section 915.25. Under current Code
 15 13 section 915.25, a complaint which alleges that a child who is
 15 14 at least 10 years of age committed a delinquent act, which if
 15 15 committed by an adult would be a public offense, is a public
 15 16 record. Current Code section 915.25 authorizes the court,
 15 17 its designee, or law enforcement officials to release such
 15 18 a complaint, including the identity of the child. The bill
 15 19 amends Code section 915.25 to provide that such a complaint
 15 20 is confidential unless the complaint alleges that the child
 15 21 committed a delinquent act that if committed by an adult would
 15 22 be a forcible felony. However, the bill authorizes state and
 15 23 local enforcement officials to release a confidential complaint
 15 24 against a child if the child is at large and doing so is deemed
 15 25 necessary for the protection of the public or the safety of
 15 26 the child. If the complaint is not confidential because the
 15 27 alleged delinquent act is an act that would be a forcible
 15 28 felony if committed by an adult, the court, its designee,
 15 29 or law enforcement officials may release such a complaint,
 15 30 including the identity of the child.
 15 31    The bill provides that an intake or juvenile court officer
 15 32 shall disclose to the alleged victim of a delinquent act, upon
 15 33 request, the complaint, the name and address of the child who
 15 34 allegedly committed the delinquent act, and the disposition
 15 35 of the complaint. If the alleged delinquent act would be
 16  1 a forcible felony if committed by an adult, the intake or
 16  2 juvenile court officer shall provide notification to the victim
 16  3 as required by Code section 915.24.
 16  4    SEALING OF JUVENILE COURT RECORDS UNAVAILABLE FOR
 16  5 OPERATING=WHILE=INTOXICATED VIOLATIONS.  Under current Code
 16  6 section 232.150, a court shall order juvenile court records
 16  7 to be sealed if the person who is the subject of the juvenile
 16  8 court records is 18 years of age or older and 2 years have
 16  9 elapsed since the last official action in the person's case,
 16 10 the person has not been subsequently convicted of a felony
 16 11 or an aggravated or serious misdemeanor or adjudicated a
 16 12 delinquent child for an act which if committed by an adult
 16 13 would be a felony, an aggravated misdemeanor, or a serious
 16 14 misdemeanor and no proceeding is pending seeking such
 16 15 conviction or adjudication, and the person was not placed on
 16 16 youthful offender status, transferred back to district court
 16 17 after the youthful offender's 18th birthday, and sentenced for
 16 18 the offense which precipitated the youthful offender placement.
 16 19 The bill in newly designated Code section 232.150(4) provides
 16 20 that the court shall not seal a person's juvenile court records
 16 21 if the person was adjudicated delinquent for violating Code
 16 22 section 321J.2, which prohibits the operation of a motor
 16 23 vehicle while under the influence of alcohol or a drug.
 16 24    RELEASE OF CONFIDENTIAL RECORDS.  The bill provides that a
 16 25 public record which is confidential under the provisions of
 16 26 Code chapter 232 shall only be subject to release upon order of
 16 27 a court in a proceeding under Code chapter 232.
 16 28    EXISTING CONFIDENTIALITY EXEMPTIONS.  The bill retains
 16 29 certain existing exemptions to confidentiality of juvenile
 16 30 court records. Pursuant to Code section 692A.121(8), records
 16 31 concerning sex offense convictions which are committed by
 16 32 minors may be released in the same manner as records of

 17  5 that a child has the right to be represented by counsel at a
 17  6 hearing on a confidentiality order under Code section 232.149A
 17  7 or a public records order under Code section 232.149B.

 13 19 OR EVIDENCE.  The bill in newly designated Code section
 13 20 232.147(13) provides that the confidentiality of a final
 13 21 adjudication of delinquency under Code section 232.147 or

 13 23 from pleading or proving the adjudication at a subsequent

 13 35 files of a criminal or juvenile justice agency concerning
 14  1 a child involved in a delinquent act are public records,
 14  2 subject to certain exceptions. The bill in Code section
 14  3 232.149 provides that the records and files of a criminal or
 14  4 juvenile justice agency, an intake officer, or a juvenile court
 14  5 officer concerning a child involved in a delinquent act are
 14  6 confidential. The bill further provides that the records of an
 14  7 intake officer or juvenile court officer containing a dismissal
 14  8 of a complaint or an informal adjustment of a complaint when
 14  9 no petition is filed relating to the complaint, shall not be

 14 29 court records in such a delinquency proceeding to be public
 14 30 records if either the public's interest in making the records

 15  4 for a public offense that would be a serious misdemeanor,
 15  5 aggravated misdemeanor, or felony offense if committed by an
 15  6 adult, or another delinquency proceeding is pending seeking
 15  7 such an adjudication. The bill provides that records subject
 15  8 to a public records order may be sealed at a later date

 15 10    RIGHT TO REVIEW AND RELEASE A CONFIDENTIAL COMPLAINT.  The
 15 11 bill provides that delinquency complaints shall be released
 15 12 in accordance with Code section 915.25. Under current Code
 15 13 section 915.25, a complaint which alleges that a child who is
 15 14 at least 10 years of age committed a delinquent act, which if
 15 15 committed by an adult would be a public offense, is a public
 15 16 record. Current Code section 915.25 authorizes the court,
 15 17 its designee, or law enforcement officials to release such

 15 20 is confidential unless the complaint alleges that the child
 15 21 committed a delinquent act that if committed by an adult would
 15 22 be a forcible felony. However, the bill authorizes state and

 15 10    RIGHT TO REVIEW AND RELEASE A CONFIDENTIAL COMPLAINT.  The
 15 11 bill provides that delinquency complaints shall be released
 15 12 in accordance with Code section 915.25. Under current Code
 15 13 section 915.25, a complaint which alleges that a child who is
 15 14 at least 10 years of age committed a delinquent act, which if
 15 15 committed by an adult would be a public offense, is a public
 15 16 record. Current Code section 915.25 authorizes the court,
 15 17 its designee, or law enforcement officials to release such
 15 18 a complaint, including the identity of the child. The bill
 15 19 amends Code section 915.25 to provide that such a complaint
 15 20 is confidential unless the complaint alleges that the child
 15 21 committed a delinquent act that if committed by an adult would

 15 27 alleged delinquent act is an act that would be a forcible
 15 28 felony if committed by an adult, the court, its designee,
 15 29 or law enforcement officials may release such a complaint,
 15 30 including the identity of the child.
 15 31    The bill provides that an intake or juvenile court officer
 15 32 shall disclose to the alleged victim of a delinquent act, upon
 15 33 request, the complaint, the name and address of the child who
 15 34 allegedly committed the delinquent act, and the disposition
 15 35 of the complaint. If the alleged delinquent act would be
 16  1 a forcible felony if committed by an adult, the intake or
 16  2 juvenile court officer shall provide notification to the victim
 16  3 as required by Code section 915.24.
 16  4    SEALING OF JUVENILE COURT RECORDS UNAVAILABLE FOR
 16  5 OPERATING=WHILE=INTOXICATED VIOLATIONS.  Under current Code
 16  6 section 232.150, a court shall order juvenile court records
 16  7 to be sealed if the person who is the subject of the juvenile
 16  8 court records is 18 years of age or older and 2 years have
 16  9 elapsed since the last official action in the person's case,
 16 10 the person has not been subsequently convicted of a felony
 16 11 or an aggravated or serious misdemeanor or adjudicated a
 16 12 delinquent child for an act which if committed by an adult
 16 13 would be a felony, an aggravated misdemeanor, or a serious
 16 14 misdemeanor and no proceeding is pending seeking such
 16 15 conviction or adjudication, and the person was not placed on
 16 16 youthful offender status, transferred back to district court
 16 17 after the youthful offender's 18th birthday, and sentenced for
 16 18 the offense which precipitated the youthful offender placement.
 16 19 The bill in newly designated Code section 232.150(4) provides
 16 20 that the court shall not seal a person's juvenile court records
 16 21 if the person was adjudicated delinquent for violating Code
 16 22 section 321J.2, which prohibits the operation of a motor
 16 23 vehicle while under the influence of alcohol or a drug.
 16 24    RELEASE OF CONFIDENTIAL RECORDS.  The bill provides that a
 16 25 public record which is confidential under the provisions of
 16 26 Code chapter 232 shall only be subject to release upon order of
 16 27 a court in a proceeding under Code chapter 232.
 16 28    EXISTING CONFIDENTIALITY EXEMPTIONS.  The bill retains
 16 29 certain existing exemptions to confidentiality of juvenile
 16 30 court records. Pursuant to Code section 692A.121(8), records
 16 31 concerning sex offense convictions which are committed by
 16 32 minors may be released in the same manner as records of
 16 33 convictions of adults. Pursuant to Code section 915.10A,
 16 34 information concerning a juvenile charged with a felony offense
 16 35 may be released pursuant to an automated victim notification
 17  1 system. Under the bill, these exemptions to confidentiality
 17  2 are not amended and therefore still apply to juvenile court
 17  3 records.
 17  4    RIGHT TO COUNSEL.  The bill in Code section 232.11 provides
 17  5 that a child has the right to be represented by counsel at a
 17  6 hearing on a confidentiality order under Code section 232.149A
 17  7 or a public records order under Code section 232.149B.
 17  8    APPLICABILITY.  The bill applies to juvenile delinquency
 17  9 proceedings which are pending or arise on or after July 1,
 17 10 2016.

 13 18    USE OF ADJUDICATION OF DELINQUENCY FOR PENALTY ENHANCEMENTS
 13 19 OR EVIDENCE.  The bill in newly designated Code section
 13 20 232.147(13) provides that the confidentiality of a final
 13 21 adjudication of delinquency under Code section 232.147 or
 13 22 pursuant to Code section 232.149A shall not prohibit the state
 13 23 from pleading or proving the adjudication at a subsequent
 13 24 criminal or delinquency proceeding for the purpose of penalty
 13 25 enhancement when a provision of the Code specifically deems the
 13 26 delinquency adjudication to constitute a final conviction.
 13 27    The bill in newly designated Code section 232.147(14)
 13 28 provides that the provisions of the bill shall not be construed
 13 29 to limit or restrict the production, use, or introduction
 13 30 of official juvenile court records in any juvenile or adult
 13 31 criminal proceeding, where such records are relevant and deemed
 13 32 admissible under any other provision of the law.
 13 33    CONFIDENTIALITY OF RECORDS AND FILES OF CRIMINAL OR
 13 34 JUVENILE JUSTICE AGENCIES.  Under current law, records and
 13 35 files of a criminal or juvenile justice agency concerning
 14  1 a child involved in a delinquent act are public records,
 14  2 subject to certain exceptions. The bill in Code section
 14  3 232.149 provides that the records and files of a criminal or
 14  4 juvenile justice agency, an intake officer, or a juvenile court
 14  5 officer concerning a child involved in a delinquent act are
 14  6 confidential. The bill further provides that the records of an
 14  7 intake officer or juvenile court officer containing a dismissal
 14  8 of a complaint or an informal adjustment of a complaint when
 14  9 no petition is filed relating to the complaint, shall not be
 14 10 available to the public, but may be disclosed to the judge and
 14 11 professional court staff, including juvenile court officers;
 14 12 the child's counsel or guardian ad litem; the county attorney
 14 13 and county attorney's assistants;  the superintendent or the
 14 14 superintendent's designee of the school district for the
 14 15 school attended by the child or the authorities in charge of
 14 16 an accredited nonpublic school attended by the child; a member
 14 17 of the armed forces of the United States who is conducting a
 14 18 background investigation of an individual pursuant to federal
 14 19 law; the statistical analysis center for the purposes stated
 14 20 in Code section 216A.136; the state public defender;  the
 14 21 department of human services; and the alleged victim of the
 14 22 delinquent act.
 14 23    PUBLIC RECORDS HEARINGS.  The bill enacts new Code section
 14 24 232.149B, which provides that a person may apply for a court
 14 25 order to make confidential juvenile court records public.
 14 26 The bill provides that a rebuttable presumption exists that
 14 27 official juvenile court records shall remain confidential. The
 14 28 bill provides that the court shall order the official juvenile
 14 29 court records in such a delinquency proceeding to be public
 14 30 records if either the public's interest in making the records
 14 31 public outweighs the juvenile's interest in maintaining the
 14 32 confidentiality of the records or the juvenile has been placed
 14 33 on youthful offender status pursuant to Code section 232.45(7)
 14 34 and Code section 907.3A(1), and will be transferred back to
 14 35 the district court for sentencing prior to the child's 18th
 15  1 birthday. The court may order the official juvenile court
 15  2 records in such a delinquency proceeding to be public records
 15  3 if the juvenile has been subsequently adjudicated delinquent
 15  4 for a public offense that would be a serious misdemeanor,
 15  5 aggravated misdemeanor, or felony offense if committed by an
 15  6 adult, or another delinquency proceeding is pending seeking
 15  7 such an adjudication. The bill provides that records subject
 15  8 to a public records order may be sealed at a later date
 15  9 pursuant to Code section 232.150.
 15 10    RIGHT TO REVIEW AND RELEASE A CONFIDENTIAL COMPLAINT.  The
 15 11 bill provides that delinquency complaints shall be released
 15 12 in accordance with Code section 915.25. Under current Code
 15 13 section 915.25, a complaint which alleges that a child who is
 15 14 at least 10 years of age committed a delinquent act, which if
 15 15 committed by an adult would be a public offense, is a public
 15 16 record. Current Code section 915.25 authorizes the court,
 15 17 its designee, or law enforcement officials to release such
 15 18 a complaint, including the identity of the child. The bill
 15 19 amends Code section 915.25 to provide that such a complaint
 15 20 is confidential unless the complaint alleges that the child
 15 21 committed a delinquent act that if committed by an adult would
 15 22 be a forcible felony. However, the bill authorizes state and
 15 23 local enforcement officials to release a confidential complaint
 15 24 against a child if the child is at large and doing so is deemed
 15 25 necessary for the protection of the public or the safety of
 15 26 the child. If the complaint is not confidential because the
 15 27 alleged delinquent act is an act that would be a forcible
 15 28 felony if committed by an adult, the court, its designee,
 15 29 or law enforcement officials may release such a complaint,
 15 30 including the identity of the child.
 15 31    The bill provides that an intake or juvenile court officer
 15 32 shall disclose to the alleged victim of a delinquent act, upon
 15 33 request, the complaint, the name and address of the child who
 15 34 allegedly committed the delinquent act, and the disposition
 15 35 of the complaint. If the alleged delinquent act would be
 16  1 a forcible felony if committed by an adult, the intake or
 16  2 juvenile court officer shall provide notification to the victim
 16  3 as required by Code section 915.24.
 16  4    SEALING OF JUVENILE COURT RECORDS UNAVAILABLE FOR
 16  5 OPERATING=WHILE=INTOXICATED VIOLATIONS.  Under current Code
 16  6 section 232.150, a court shall order juvenile court records
 16  7 to be sealed if the person who is the subject of the juvenile
 16  8 court records is 18 years of age or older and 2 years have
 16  9 elapsed since the last official action in the person's case,
 16 10 the person has not been subsequently convicted of a felony
 16 11 or an aggravated or serious misdemeanor or adjudicated a
 16 12 delinquent child for an act which if committed by an adult
 16 13 would be a felony, an aggravated misdemeanor, or a serious
 16 14 misdemeanor and no proceeding is pending seeking such
 16 15 conviction or adjudication, and the person was not placed on
 16 16 youthful offender status, transferred back to district court
 16 17 after the youthful offender's 18th birthday, and sentenced for
 16 18 the offense which precipitated the youthful offender placement.
 16 19 The bill in newly designated Code section 232.150(4) provides
 16 20 that the court shall not seal a person's juvenile court records
 16 21 if the person was adjudicated delinquent for violating Code
 16 22 section 321J.2, which prohibits the operation of a motor
 16 23 vehicle while under the influence of alcohol or a drug.
 16 24    RELEASE OF CONFIDENTIAL RECORDS.  The bill provides that a
 16 25 public record which is confidential under the provisions of
 16 26 Code chapter 232 shall only be subject to release upon order of
 16 27 a court in a proceeding under Code chapter 232.
 16 28    EXISTING CONFIDENTIALITY EXEMPTIONS.  The bill retains
 16 29 certain existing exemptions to confidentiality of juvenile
 16 30 court records. Pursuant to Code section 692A.121(8), records
 16 31 concerning sex offense convictions which are committed by
 16 32 minors may be released in the same manner as records of
 16 33 convictions of adults. Pursuant to Code section 915.10A,
 16 34 information concerning a juvenile charged with a felony offense
 16 35 may be released pursuant to an automated victim notification
 17  1 system. Under the bill, these exemptions to confidentiality
 17  2 are not amended and therefore still apply to juvenile court
 17  3 records.
 17  4    RIGHT TO COUNSEL.  The bill in Code section 232.11 provides
 17  5 that a child has the right to be represented by counsel at a
 17  6 hearing on a confidentiality order under Code section 232.149A
 17  7 or a public records order under Code section 232.149B.
 17  8    APPLICABILITY.  The bill applies to juvenile delinquency
 17  9 proceedings which are pending or arise on or after July 1,

 13 18    USE OF ADJUDICATION OF DELINQUENCY FOR PENALTY ENHANCEMENTS
 13 19 OR EVIDENCE.  The bill in newly designated Code section
 13 20 232.147(13) provides that the confidentiality of a final
 13 21 adjudication of delinquency under Code section 232.147 or
 13 22 pursuant to Code section 232.149A shall not prohibit the state
 13 23 from pleading or proving the adjudication at a subsequent
 13 24 criminal or delinquency proceeding for the purpose of penalty
 13 25 enhancement when a provision of the Code specifically deems the
 13 26 delinquency adjudication to constitute a final conviction.
 13 27    The bill in newly designated Code section 232.147(14)
 13 28 provides that the provisions of the bill shall not be construed
 13 29 to limit or restrict the production, use, or introduction
 13 30 of official juvenile court records in any juvenile or adult
 13 31 criminal proceeding, where such records are relevant and deemed
 13 32 admissible under any other provision of the law.
 13 33    CONFIDENTIALITY OF RECORDS AND FILES OF CRIMINAL OR

 14  2 subject to certain exceptions. The bill in Code section
 14  3 232.149 provides that the records and files of a criminal or
 14  4 juvenile justice agency, an intake officer, or a juvenile court
 14  5 officer concerning a child involved in a delinquent act are
 14  6 confidential. The bill further provides that the records of an
 14  7 intake officer or juvenile court officer containing a dismissal
 14  8 of a complaint or an informal adjustment of a complaint when
 14  9 no petition is filed relating to the complaint, shall not be
 14 10 available to the public, but may be disclosed to the judge and
 14 11 professional court staff, including juvenile court officers;
 14 12 the child's counsel or guardian ad litem; the county attorney
 14 13 and county attorney's assistants;  the superintendent or the
 14 14 superintendent's designee of the school district for the
 14 15 school attended by the child or the authorities in charge of
 14 16 an accredited nonpublic school attended by the child; a member
 14 17 of the armed forces of the United States who is conducting a

 14 21 department of human services; and the alleged victim of the
 14 22 delinquent act.
 14 23    PUBLIC RECORDS HEARINGS.  The bill enacts new Code section
 14 24 232.149B, which provides that a person may apply for a court
 14 25 order to make confidential juvenile court records public.
 14 26 The bill provides that a rebuttable presumption exists that
 14 27 official juvenile court records shall remain confidential. The

 14 29 court records in such a delinquency proceeding to be public
 14 30 records if either the public's interest in making the records
 14 31 public outweighs the juvenile's interest in maintaining the
 14 32 confidentiality of the records or the juvenile has been placed
 14 33 on youthful offender status pursuant to Code section 232.45(7)
 14 34 and Code section 907.3A(1), and will be transferred back to
 14 35 the district court for sentencing prior to the child's 18th
 15  1 birthday. The court may order the official juvenile court
 15  2 records in such a delinquency proceeding to be public records
 15  3 if the juvenile has been subsequently adjudicated delinquent
 15  4 for a public offense that would be a serious misdemeanor,
 15  5 aggravated misdemeanor, or felony offense if committed by an
 15  6 adult, or another delinquency proceeding is pending seeking
 15  7 such an adjudication. The bill provides that records subject
 15  8 to a public records order may be sealed at a later date
 15  9 pursuant to Code section 232.150.
 15 10    RIGHT TO REVIEW AND RELEASE A CONFIDENTIAL COMPLAINT.  The
 15 11 bill provides that delinquency complaints shall be released
 15 12 in accordance with Code section 915.25. Under current Code
 15 13 section 915.25, a complaint which alleges that a child who is
 15 14 at least 10 years of age committed a delinquent act, which if
 15 15 committed by an adult would be a public offense, is a public
 15 16 record. Current Code section 915.25 authorizes the court,
 15 17 its designee, or law enforcement officials to release such
 15 18 a complaint, including the identity of the child. The bill
 15 19 amends Code section 915.25 to provide that such a complaint
 15 20 is confidential unless the complaint alleges that the child
 15 21 committed a delinquent act that if committed by an adult would
 15 22 be a forcible felony. However, the bill authorizes state and
 15 23 local enforcement officials to release a confidential complaint
 15 24 against a child if the child is at large and doing so is deemed
 15 25 necessary for the protection of the public or the safety of
 15 26 the child. If the complaint is not confidential because the
 15 27 alleged delinquent act is an act that would be a forcible
 15 28 felony if committed by an adult, the court, its designee,
 15 29 or law enforcement officials may release such a complaint,
 15 30 including the identity of the child.
 15 31    The bill provides that an intake or juvenile court officer
 15 32 shall disclose to the alleged victim of a delinquent act, upon
 15 33 request, the complaint, the name and address of the child who
 15 34 allegedly committed the delinquent act, and the disposition

 15 10    RIGHT TO REVIEW AND RELEASE A CONFIDENTIAL COMPLAINT.  The
 15 11 bill provides that delinquency complaints shall be released

 15 13 section 915.25, a complaint which alleges that a child who is

 15 15 committed by an adult would be a public offense, is a public
 15 16 record. Current Code section 915.25 authorizes the court,

 15 18 a complaint, including the identity of the child. The bill
 15 19 amends Code section 915.25 to provide that such a complaint
 15 20 is confidential unless the complaint alleges that the child
 15 21 committed a delinquent act that if committed by an adult would
 15 22 be a forcible felony. However, the bill authorizes state and

 15 32 shall disclose to the alleged victim of a delinquent act, upon
 15 33 request, the complaint, the name and address of the child who
 15 34 allegedly committed the delinquent act, and the disposition
 15 35 of the complaint. If the alleged delinquent act would be

 16  8 court records is 18 years of age or older and 2 years have
 16  9 elapsed since the last official action in the person's case,
 16 10 the person has not been subsequently convicted of a felony
 16 11 or an aggravated or serious misdemeanor or adjudicated a
 16 12 delinquent child for an act which if committed by an adult
 16 13 would be a felony, an aggravated misdemeanor, or a serious
 16 14 misdemeanor and no proceeding is pending seeking such
 16 15 conviction or adjudication, and the person was not placed on
 16 16 youthful offender status, transferred back to district court
 16 17 after the youthful offender's 18th birthday, and sentenced for
 16 18 the offense which precipitated the youthful offender placement.
 16 19 The bill in newly designated Code section 232.150(4) provides
 16 20 that the court shall not seal a person's juvenile court records
 16 21 if the person was adjudicated delinquent for violating Code
 16 22 section 321J.2, which prohibits the operation of a motor
 16 23 vehicle while under the influence of alcohol or a drug.
 16 24    RELEASE OF CONFIDENTIAL RECORDS.  The bill provides that a
 16 25 public record which is confidential under the provisions of
 16 26 Code chapter 232 shall only be subject to release upon order of
 16 27 a court in a proceeding under Code chapter 232.
 16 28    EXISTING CONFIDENTIALITY EXEMPTIONS.  The bill retains
 16 29 certain existing exemptions to confidentiality of juvenile
 16 30 court records. Pursuant to Code section 692A.121(8), records
 16 31 concerning sex offense convictions which are committed by
 16 32 minors may be released in the same manner as records of
 16 33 convictions of adults. Pursuant to Code section 915.10A,
 16 34 information concerning a juvenile charged with a felony offense
 16 35 may be released pursuant to an automated victim notification
 17  1 system. Under the bill, these exemptions to confidentiality
 17  2 are not amended and therefore still apply to juvenile court
 17  3 records.
 17  4    RIGHT TO COUNSEL.  The bill in Code section 232.11 provides
 17  5 that a child has the right to be represented by counsel at a
 17  6 hearing on a confidentiality order under Code section 232.149A
 17  7 or a public records order under Code section 232.149B.
 17  8    APPLICABILITY.  The bill applies to juvenile delinquency
 17  9 proceedings which are pending or arise on or after July 1,
 17 10 2016.

 13 18    USE OF ADJUDICATION OF DELINQUENCY FOR PENALTY ENHANCEMENTS
 13 19 OR EVIDENCE.  The bill in newly designated Code section
 13 20 232.147(13) provides that the confidentiality of a final
 13 21 adjudication of delinquency under Code section 232.147 or
 13 22 pursuant to Code section 232.149A shall not prohibit the state
 13 23 from pleading or proving the adjudication at a subsequent
 13 24 criminal or delinquency proceeding for the purpose of penalty
 13 25 enhancement when a provision of the Code specifically deems the
 13 26 delinquency adjudication to constitute a final conviction.
 13 27    The bill in newly designated Code section 232.147(14)
 13 28 provides that the provisions of the bill shall not be construed
 13 29 to limit or restrict the production, use, or introduction
 13 30 of official juvenile court records in any juvenile or adult
 13 31 criminal proceeding, where such records are relevant and deemed
 13 32 admissible under any other provision of the law.
 13 33    CONFIDENTIALITY OF RECORDS AND FILES OF CRIMINAL OR
 13 34 JUVENILE JUSTICE AGENCIES.  Under current law, records and
 13 35 files of a criminal or juvenile justice agency concerning
 14  1 a child involved in a delinquent act are public records,
 14  2 subject to certain exceptions. The bill in Code section
 14  3 232.149 provides that the records and files of a criminal or
 14  4 juvenile justice agency, an intake officer, or a juvenile court
 14  5 officer concerning a child involved in a delinquent act are
 14  6 confidential. The bill further provides that the records of an
 14  7 intake officer or juvenile court officer containing a dismissal
 14  8 of a complaint or an informal adjustment of a complaint when
 14  9 no petition is filed relating to the complaint, shall not be
 14 10 available to the public, but may be disclosed to the judge and
 14 11 professional court staff, including juvenile court officers;
 14 12 the child's counsel or guardian ad litem; the county attorney
 14 13 and county attorney's assistants;  the superintendent or the
 14 14 superintendent's designee of the school district for the
 14 15 school attended by the child or the authorities in charge of
 14 16 an accredited nonpublic school attended by the child; a member
 14 17 of the armed forces of the United States who is conducting a
 14 18 background investigation of an individual pursuant to federal
 14 19 law; the statistical analysis center for the purposes stated
 14 20 in Code section 216A.136; the state public defender;  the
 14 21 department of human services; and the alleged victim of the
 14 22 delinquent act.
 14 23    PUBLIC RECORDS HEARINGS.  The bill enacts new Code section
 14 24 232.149B, which provides that a person may apply for a court
 14 25 order to make confidential juvenile court records public.
 14 26 The bill provides that a rebuttable presumption exists that
 14 27 official juvenile court records shall remain confidential. The
 14 28 bill provides that the court shall order the official juvenile
 14 29 court records in such a delinquency proceeding to be public
 14 30 records if either the public's interest in making the records
 14 31 public outweighs the juvenile's interest in maintaining the
 14 32 confidentiality of the records or the juvenile has been placed
 14 33 on youthful offender status pursuant to Code section 232.45(7)
 14 34 and Code section 907.3A(1), and will be transferred back to
 14 35 the district court for sentencing prior to the child's 18th
 15  1 birthday. The court may order the official juvenile court
 15  2 records in such a delinquency proceeding to be public records
 15  3 if the juvenile has been subsequently adjudicated delinquent
 15  4 for a public offense that would be a serious misdemeanor,
 15  5 aggravated misdemeanor, or felony offense if committed by an
 15  6 adult, or another delinquency proceeding is pending seeking
 15  7 such an adjudication. The bill provides that records subject
 15  8 to a public records order may be sealed at a later date
 15  9 pursuant to Code section 232.150.
 15 10    RIGHT TO REVIEW AND RELEASE A CONFIDENTIAL COMPLAINT.  The
 15 11 bill provides that delinquency complaints shall be released
 15 12 in accordance with Code section 915.25. Under current Code
 15 13 section 915.25, a complaint which alleges that a child who is
 15 14 at least 10 years of age committed a delinquent act, which if
 15 15 committed by an adult would be a public offense, is a public
 15 16 record. Current Code section 915.25 authorizes the court,
 15 17 its designee, or law enforcement officials to release such
 15 18 a complaint, including the identity of the child. The bill
 15 19 amends Code section 915.25 to provide that such a complaint
 15 20 is confidential unless the complaint alleges that the child
 15 21 committed a delinquent act that if committed by an adult would
 15 22 be a forcible felony. However, the bill authorizes state and
 15 23 local enforcement officials to release a confidential complaint
 15 24 against a child if the child is at large and doing so is deemed
 15 25 necessary for the protection of the public or the safety of
 15 26 the child. If the complaint is not confidential because the
 15 27 alleged delinquent act is an act that would be a forcible
 15 28 felony if committed by an adult, the court, its designee,
 15 29 or law enforcement officials may release such a complaint,
 15 30 including the identity of the child.
 15 31    The bill provides that an intake or juvenile court officer
 15 32 shall disclose to the alleged victim of a delinquent act, upon
 15 33 request, the complaint, the name and address of the child who
 15 34 allegedly committed the delinquent act, and the disposition
 15 35 of the complaint. If the alleged delinquent act would be
 16  1 a forcible felony if committed by an adult, the intake or
 16  2 juvenile court officer shall provide notification to the victim
 16  3 as required by Code section 915.24.
 16  4    SEALING OF JUVENILE COURT RECORDS UNAVAILABLE FOR
 16  5 OPERATING=WHILE=INTOXICATED VIOLATIONS.  Under current Code
 16  6 section 232.150, a court shall order juvenile court records
 16  7 to be sealed if the person who is the subject of the juvenile
 16  8 court records is 18 years of age or older and 2 years have
 16  9 elapsed since the last official action in the person's case,
 16 10 the person has not been subsequently convicted of a felony
 16 11 or an aggravated or serious misdemeanor or adjudicated a
 16 12 delinquent child for an act which if committed by an adult
 16 13 would be a felony, an aggravated misdemeanor, or a serious
 16 14 misdemeanor and no proceeding is pending seeking such
 16 15 conviction or adjudication, and the person was not placed on
 16 16 youthful offender status, transferred back to district court
 16 17 after the youthful offender's 18th birthday, and sentenced for
 16 18 the offense which precipitated the youthful offender placement.
 16 19 The bill in newly designated Code section 232.150(4) provides
 16 20 that the court shall not seal a person's juvenile court records
 16 21 if the person was adjudicated delinquent for violating Code
 16 22 section 321J.2, which prohibits the operation of a motor
 16 23 vehicle while under the influence of alcohol or a drug.
 16 24    RELEASE OF CONFIDENTIAL RECORDS.  The bill provides that a
 16 25 public record which is confidential under the provisions of
 16 26 Code chapter 232 shall only be subject to release upon order of
 16 27 a court in a proceeding under Code chapter 232.
 16 28    EXISTING CONFIDENTIALITY EXEMPTIONS.  The bill retains
 16 29 certain existing exemptions to confidentiality of juvenile
 16 30 court records. Pursuant to Code section 692A.121(8), records
 16 31 concerning sex offense convictions which are committed by
 16 32 minors may be released in the same manner as records of
 16 33 convictions of adults. Pursuant to Code section 915.10A,
 16 34 information concerning a juvenile charged with a felony offense
 16 35 may be released pursuant to an automated victim notification
 17  1 system. Under the bill, these exemptions to confidentiality
 17  2 are not amended and therefore still apply to juvenile court
 17  3 records.
 17  4    RIGHT TO COUNSEL.  The bill in Code section 232.11 provides
 17  5 that a child has the right to be represented by counsel at a
 17  6 hearing on a confidentiality order under Code section 232.149A
 17  7 or a public records order under Code section 232.149B.
 17  8    APPLICABILITY.  The bill applies to juvenile delinquency
 17  9 proceedings which are pending or arise on or after July 1,

 13 23 from pleading or proving the adjudication at a subsequent

 13 33    CONFIDENTIALITY OF RECORDS AND FILES OF CRIMINAL OR

 14  5 officer concerning a child involved in a delinquent act are

 14  7 intake officer or juvenile court officer containing a dismissal
 14  8 of a complaint or an informal adjustment of a complaint when
 14  9 no petition is filed relating to the complaint, shall not be
 14 10 available to the public, but may be disclosed to the judge and

 14 13 and county attorney's assistants;  the superintendent or the

 14 23    PUBLIC RECORDS HEARINGS.  The bill enacts new Code section
 14 24 232.149B, which provides that a person may apply for a court
 14 25 order to make confidential juvenile court records public.
 14 26 The bill provides that a rebuttable presumption exists that
 14 27 official juvenile court records shall remain confidential. The

 15 10    RIGHT TO REVIEW AND RELEASE A CONFIDENTIAL COMPLAINT.  The
 15 11 bill provides that delinquency complaints shall be released
 15 12 in accordance with Code section 915.25. Under current Code
 15 13 section 915.25, a complaint which alleges that a child who is
 15 14 at least 10 years of age committed a delinquent act, which if
 15 15 committed by an adult would be a public offense, is a public
 15 16 record. Current Code section 915.25 authorizes the court,

 16 12 delinquent child for an act which if committed by an adult
 16 13 would be a felony, an aggravated misdemeanor, or a serious
 16 14 misdemeanor and no proceeding is pending seeking such
 16 15 conviction or adjudication, and the person was not placed on
 16 16 youthful offender status, transferred back to district court
 16 17 after the youthful offender's 18th birthday, and sentenced for
 16 18 the offense which precipitated the youthful offender placement.
 16 19 The bill in newly designated Code section 232.150(4) provides
 16 20 that the court shall not seal a person's juvenile court records
 16 21 if the person was adjudicated delinquent for violating Code
 16 22 section 321J.2, which prohibits the operation of a motor
 16 23 vehicle while under the influence of alcohol or a drug.
 16 24    RELEASE OF CONFIDENTIAL RECORDS.  The bill provides that a
 16 25 public record which is confidential under the provisions of
 16 26 Code chapter 232 shall only be subject to release upon order of
 16 27 a court in a proceeding under Code chapter 232.
 16 28    EXISTING CONFIDENTIALITY EXEMPTIONS.  The bill retains
 16 29 certain existing exemptions to confidentiality of juvenile
 16 30 court records. Pursuant to Code section 692A.121(8), records
 16 31 concerning sex offense convictions which are committed by
 16 32 minors may be released in the same manner as records of
 16 33 convictions of adults. Pursuant to Code section 915.10A,
 16 34 information concerning a juvenile charged with a felony offense
 16 35 may be released pursuant to an automated victim notification
 17  1 system. Under the bill, these exemptions to confidentiality
 17  2 are not amended and therefore still apply to juvenile court
 17  3 records.
 17  4    RIGHT TO COUNSEL.  The bill in Code section 232.11 provides
 17  5 that a child has the right to be represented by counsel at a
 17  6 hearing on a confidentiality order under Code section 232.149A
 17  7 or a public records order under Code section 232.149B.
 17  8    APPLICABILITY.  The bill applies to juvenile delinquency
 17  9 proceedings which are pending or arise on or after July 1,
 17 10 2016.

 13 22 pursuant to Code section 232.149A shall not prohibit the state
 13 23 from pleading or proving the adjudication at a subsequent
 13 24 criminal or delinquency proceeding for the purpose of penalty
 13 25 enhancement when a provision of the Code specifically deems the
 13 26 delinquency adjudication to constitute a final conviction.
 13 27    The bill in newly designated Code section 232.147(14)
 13 28 provides that the provisions of the bill shall not be construed
 13 29 to limit or restrict the production, use, or introduction
 13 30 of official juvenile court records in any juvenile or adult
 13 31 criminal proceeding, where such records are relevant and deemed
 13 32 admissible under any other provision of the law.
 13 33    CONFIDENTIALITY OF RECORDS AND FILES OF CRIMINAL OR
 13 34 JUVENILE JUSTICE AGENCIES.  Under current law, records and
 13 35 files of a criminal or juvenile justice agency concerning
 14  1 a child involved in a delinquent act are public records,
 14  2 subject to certain exceptions. The bill in Code section
 14  3 232.149 provides that the records and files of a criminal or
 14  4 juvenile justice agency, an intake officer, or a juvenile court
 14  5 officer concerning a child involved in a delinquent act are
 14  6 confidential. The bill further provides that the records of an
 14  7 intake officer or juvenile court officer containing a dismissal
 14  8 of a complaint or an informal adjustment of a complaint when
 14  9 no petition is filed relating to the complaint, shall not be
 14 10 available to the public, but may be disclosed to the judge and
 14 11 professional court staff, including juvenile court officers;
 14 12 the child's counsel or guardian ad litem; the county attorney
 14 13 and county attorney's assistants;  the superintendent or the
 14 14 superintendent's designee of the school district for the
 14 15 school attended by the child or the authorities in charge of
 14 16 an accredited nonpublic school attended by the child; a member
 14 17 of the armed forces of the United States who is conducting a
 14 18 background investigation of an individual pursuant to federal
 14 19 law; the statistical analysis center for the purposes stated
 14 20 in Code section 216A.136; the state public defender;  the
 14 21 department of human services; and the alleged victim of the
 14 22 delinquent act.
 14 23    PUBLIC RECORDS HEARINGS.  The bill enacts new Code section
 14 24 232.149B, which provides that a person may apply for a court
 14 25 order to make confidential juvenile court records public.
 14 26 The bill provides that a rebuttable presumption exists that
 14 27 official juvenile court records shall remain confidential. The
 14 28 bill provides that the court shall order the official juvenile
 14 29 court records in such a delinquency proceeding to be public
 14 30 records if either the public's interest in making the records
 14 31 public outweighs the juvenile's interest in maintaining the
 14 32 confidentiality of the records or the juvenile has been placed
 14 33 on youthful offender status pursuant to Code section 232.45(7)
 14 34 and Code section 907.3A(1), and will be transferred back to
 14 35 the district court for sentencing prior to the child's 18th
 15  1 birthday. The court may order the official juvenile court
 15  2 records in such a delinquency proceeding to be public records
 15  3 if the juvenile has been subsequently adjudicated delinquent
 15  4 for a public offense that would be a serious misdemeanor,
 15  5 aggravated misdemeanor, or felony offense if committed by an
 15  6 adult, or another delinquency proceeding is pending seeking
 15  7 such an adjudication. The bill provides that records subject
 15  8 to a public records order may be sealed at a later date
 15  9 pursuant to Code section 232.150.
 15 10    RIGHT TO REVIEW AND RELEASE A CONFIDENTIAL COMPLAINT.  The
 15 11 bill provides that delinquency complaints shall be released
 15 12 in accordance with Code section 915.25. Under current Code
 15 13 section 915.25, a complaint which alleges that a child who is
 15 14 at least 10 years of age committed a delinquent act, which if
 15 15 committed by an adult would be a public offense, is a public
 15 16 record. Current Code section 915.25 authorizes the court,
 15 17 its designee, or law enforcement officials to release such
 15 18 a complaint, including the identity of the child. The bill
 15 19 amends Code section 915.25 to provide that such a complaint
 15 20 is confidential unless the complaint alleges that the child
 15 21 committed a delinquent act that if committed by an adult would
 15 22 be a forcible felony. However, the bill authorizes state and
 15 23 local enforcement officials to release a confidential complaint
 15 24 against a child if the child is at large and doing so is deemed
 15 25 necessary for the protection of the public or the safety of
 15 26 the child. If the complaint is not confidential because the
 15 27 alleged delinquent act is an act that would be a forcible
 15 28 felony if committed by an adult, the court, its designee,
 15 29 or law enforcement officials may release such a complaint,
 15 30 including the identity of the child.
 15 31    The bill provides that an intake or juvenile court officer
 15 32 shall disclose to the alleged victim of a delinquent act, upon
 15 33 request, the complaint, the name and address of the child who
 15 34 allegedly committed the delinquent act, and the disposition
 15 35 of the complaint. If the alleged delinquent act would be
 16  1 a forcible felony if committed by an adult, the intake or
 16  2 juvenile court officer shall provide notification to the victim
 16  3 as required by Code section 915.24.
 16  4    SEALING OF JUVENILE COURT RECORDS UNAVAILABLE FOR
 16  5 OPERATING=WHILE=INTOXICATED VIOLATIONS.  Under current Code
 16  6 section 232.150, a court shall order juvenile court records
 16  7 to be sealed if the person who is the subject of the juvenile
 16  8 court records is 18 years of age or older and 2 years have
 16  9 elapsed since the last official action in the person's case,
 16 10 the person has not been subsequently convicted of a felony
 16 11 or an aggravated or serious misdemeanor or adjudicated a
 16 12 delinquent child for an act which if committed by an adult
 16 13 would be a felony, an aggravated misdemeanor, or a serious
 16 14 misdemeanor and no proceeding is pending seeking such
 16 15 conviction or adjudication, and the person was not placed on
 16 16 youthful offender status, transferred back to district court
 16 17 after the youthful offender's 18th birthday, and sentenced for
 16 18 the offense which precipitated the youthful offender placement.
 16 19 The bill in newly designated Code section 232.150(4) provides
 16 20 that the court shall not seal a person's juvenile court records
 16 21 if the person was adjudicated delinquent for violating Code
 16 22 section 321J.2, which prohibits the operation of a motor
 16 23 vehicle while under the influence of alcohol or a drug.
 16 24    RELEASE OF CONFIDENTIAL RECORDS.  The bill provides that a
 16 25 public record which is confidential under the provisions of
 16 26 Code chapter 232 shall only be subject to release upon order of
 16 27 a court in a proceeding under Code chapter 232.
 16 28    EXISTING CONFIDENTIALITY EXEMPTIONS.  The bill retains
 16 29 certain existing exemptions to confidentiality of juvenile
 16 30 court records. Pursuant to Code section 692A.121(8), records
 16 31 concerning sex offense convictions which are committed by
 16 32 minors may be released in the same manner as records of
 16 33 convictions of adults. Pursuant to Code section 915.10A,
 16 34 information concerning a juvenile charged with a felony offense
 16 35 may be released pursuant to an automated victim notification
 17  1 system. Under the bill, these exemptions to confidentiality
 17  2 are not amended and therefore still apply to juvenile court
 17  3 records.
 17  4    RIGHT TO COUNSEL.  The bill in Code section 232.11 provides
 17  5 that a child has the right to be represented by counsel at a
 17  6 hearing on a confidentiality order under Code section 232.149A
 17  7 or a public records order under Code section 232.149B.
 17  8    APPLICABILITY.  The bill applies to juvenile delinquency
 17  9 proceedings which are pending or arise on or after July 1,

 13 22 pursuant to Code section 232.149A shall not prohibit the state
 13 23 from pleading or proving the adjudication at a subsequent
 13 24 criminal or delinquency proceeding for the purpose of penalty
 13 25 enhancement when a provision of the Code specifically deems the
 13 26 delinquency adjudication to constitute a final conviction.
 13 27    The bill in newly designated Code section 232.147(14)
 13 28 provides that the provisions of the bill shall not be construed
 13 29 to limit or restrict the production, use, or introduction
 13 30 of official juvenile court records in any juvenile or adult
 13 31 criminal proceeding, where such records are relevant and deemed
 13 32 admissible under any other provision of the law.
 13 33    CONFIDENTIALITY OF RECORDS AND FILES OF CRIMINAL OR
 13 34 JUVENILE JUSTICE AGENCIES.  Under current law, records and
 13 35 files of a criminal or juvenile justice agency concerning
 14  1 a child involved in a delinquent act are public records,
 14  2 subject to certain exceptions. The bill in Code section
 14  3 232.149 provides that the records and files of a criminal or
 14  4 juvenile justice agency, an intake officer, or a juvenile court
 14  5 officer concerning a child involved in a delinquent act are
 14  6 confidential. The bill further provides that the records of an
 14  7 intake officer or juvenile court officer containing a dismissal
 14  8 of a complaint or an informal adjustment of a complaint when
 14  9 no petition is filed relating to the complaint, shall not be
 14 10 available to the public, but may be disclosed to the judge and
 14 11 professional court staff, including juvenile court officers;
 14 12 the child's counsel or guardian ad litem; the county attorney
 14 13 and county attorney's assistants;  the superintendent or the
 14 14 superintendent's designee of the school district for the
 14 15 school attended by the child or the authorities in charge of
 14 16 an accredited nonpublic school attended by the child; a member
 14 17 of the armed forces of the United States who is conducting a
 14 18 background investigation of an individual pursuant to federal
 14 19 law; the statistical analysis center for the purposes stated
 14 20 in Code section 216A.136; the state public defender;  the
 14 21 department of human services; and the alleged victim of the
 14 22 delinquent act.
 14 23    PUBLIC RECORDS HEARINGS.  The bill enacts new Code section
 14 24 232.149B, which provides that a person may apply for a court
 14 25 order to make confidential juvenile court records public.
 14 26 The bill provides that a rebuttable presumption exists that
 14 27 official juvenile court records shall remain confidential. The
 14 28 bill provides that the court shall order the official juvenile
 14 29 court records in such a delinquency proceeding to be public
 14 30 records if either the public's interest in making the records
 14 31 public outweighs the juvenile's interest in maintaining the
 14 32 confidentiality of the records or the juvenile has been placed
 14 33 on youthful offender status pursuant to Code section 232.45(7)
 14 34 and Code section 907.3A(1), and will be transferred back to
 14 35 the district court for sentencing prior to the child's 18th
 15  1 birthday. The court may order the official juvenile court
 15  2 records in such a delinquency proceeding to be public records
 15  3 if the juvenile has been subsequently adjudicated delinquent
 15  4 for a public offense that would be a serious misdemeanor,
 15  5 aggravated misdemeanor, or felony offense if committed by an
 15  6 adult, or another delinquency proceeding is pending seeking
 15  7 such an adjudication. The bill provides that records subject
 15  8 to a public records order may be sealed at a later date
 15  9 pursuant to Code section 232.150.
 15 10    RIGHT TO REVIEW AND RELEASE A CONFIDENTIAL COMPLAINT.  The
 15 11 bill provides that delinquency complaints shall be released
 15 12 in accordance with Code section 915.25. Under current Code
 15 13 section 915.25, a complaint which alleges that a child who is
 15 14 at least 10 years of age committed a delinquent act, which if
 15 15 committed by an adult would be a public offense, is a public
 15 16 record. Current Code section 915.25 authorizes the court,
 15 17 its designee, or law enforcement officials to release such
 15 18 a complaint, including the identity of the child. The bill
 15 19 amends Code section 915.25 to provide that such a complaint
 15 20 is confidential unless the complaint alleges that the child
 15 21 committed a delinquent act that if committed by an adult would
 15 22 be a forcible felony. However, the bill authorizes state and
 15 23 local enforcement officials to release a confidential complaint
 15 24 against a child if the child is at large and doing so is deemed
 15 25 necessary for the protection of the public or the safety of
 15 26 the child. If the complaint is not confidential because the
 15 27 alleged delinquent act is an act that would be a forcible
 15 28 felony if committed by an adult, the court, its designee,
 15 29 or law enforcement officials may release such a complaint,
 15 30 including the identity of the child.
 15 31    The bill provides that an intake or juvenile court officer
 15 32 shall disclose to the alleged victim of a delinquent act, upon
 15 33 request, the complaint, the name and address of the child who
 15 34 allegedly committed the delinquent act, and the disposition
 15 35 of the complaint. If the alleged delinquent act would be
 16  1 a forcible felony if committed by an adult, the intake or
 16  2 juvenile court officer shall provide notification to the victim
 16  3 as required by Code section 915.24.
 16  4    SEALING OF JUVENILE COURT RECORDS UNAVAILABLE FOR
 16  5 OPERATING=WHILE=INTOXICATED VIOLATIONS.  Under current Code
 16  6 section 232.150, a court shall order juvenile court records
 16  7 to be sealed if the person who is the subject of the juvenile
 16  8 court records is 18 years of age or older and 2 years have
 16  9 elapsed since the last official action in the person's case,
 16 10 the person has not been subsequently convicted of a felony
 16 11 or an aggravated or serious misdemeanor or adjudicated a

 16 17 after the youthful offender's 18th birthday, and sentenced for
 16 18 the offense which precipitated the youthful offender placement.
 16 19 The bill in newly designated Code section 232.150(4) provides
 16 20 that the court shall not seal a person's juvenile court records
 16 21 if the person was adjudicated delinquent for violating Code
 16 22 section 321J.2, which prohibits the operation of a motor
 16 23 vehicle while under the influence of alcohol or a drug.
 16 24    RELEASE OF CONFIDENTIAL RECORDS.  The bill provides that a
 16 25 public record which is confidential under the provisions of
 16 26 Code chapter 232 shall only be subject to release upon order of
 16 27 a court in a proceeding under Code chapter 232.
 16 28    EXISTING CONFIDENTIALITY EXEMPTIONS.  The bill retains
 16 29 certain existing exemptions to confidentiality of juvenile
 16 30 court records. Pursuant to Code section 692A.121(8), records
 16 31 concerning sex offense convictions which are committed by

 14  5 officer concerning a child involved in a delinquent act are

 14 22 delinquent act.
 14 23    PUBLIC RECORDS HEARINGS.  The bill enacts new Code section
 14 24 232.149B, which provides that a person may apply for a court
 14 25 order to make confidential juvenile court records public.
 14 26 The bill provides that a rebuttable presumption exists that
 14 27 official juvenile court records shall remain confidential. The
 14 28 bill provides that the court shall order the official juvenile
 14 29 court records in such a delinquency proceeding to be public
 14 30 records if either the public's interest in making the records
 14 31 public outweighs the juvenile's interest in maintaining the

 14 34 and Code section 907.3A(1), and will be transferred back to
 14 35 the district court for sentencing prior to the child's 18th

 15  2 records in such a delinquency proceeding to be public records
 15  3 if the juvenile has been subsequently adjudicated delinquent
 15  4 for a public offense that would be a serious misdemeanor,
 15  5 aggravated misdemeanor, or felony offense if committed by an

 15  7 such an adjudication. The bill provides that records subject
 15  8 to a public records order may be sealed at a later date
 15  9 pursuant to Code section 232.150.
 15 10    RIGHT TO REVIEW AND RELEASE A CONFIDENTIAL COMPLAINT.  The
 15 11 bill provides that delinquency complaints shall be released
 15 12 in accordance with Code section 915.25. Under current Code
 15 13 section 915.25, a complaint which alleges that a child who is
 15 14 at least 10 years of age committed a delinquent act, which if
 15 15 committed by an adult would be a public offense, is a public
 15 16 record. Current Code section 915.25 authorizes the court,
 15 17 its designee, or law enforcement officials to release such
 15 18 a complaint, including the identity of the child. The bill
 15 19 amends Code section 915.25 to provide that such a complaint
 15 20 is confidential unless the complaint alleges that the child
 15 21 committed a delinquent act that if committed by an adult would
 15 22 be a forcible felony. However, the bill authorizes state and
 15 23 local enforcement officials to release a confidential complaint
 15 24 against a child if the child is at large and doing so is deemed

 15 27 alleged delinquent act is an act that would be a forcible
 15 28 felony if committed by an adult, the court, its designee,
 15 29 or law enforcement officials may release such a complaint,
 15 30 including the identity of the child.
 15 31    The bill provides that an intake or juvenile court officer
 15 32 shall disclose to the alleged victim of a delinquent act, upon
 15 33 request, the complaint, the name and address of the child who
 15 34 allegedly committed the delinquent act, and the disposition
 15 35 of the complaint. If the alleged delinquent act would be
 16  1 a forcible felony if committed by an adult, the intake or
 16  2 juvenile court officer shall provide notification to the victim
 16  3 as required by Code section 915.24.
 16  4    SEALING OF JUVENILE COURT RECORDS UNAVAILABLE FOR
 16  5 OPERATING=WHILE=INTOXICATED VIOLATIONS.  Under current Code

 16  7 to be sealed if the person who is the subject of the juvenile
 16  8 court records is 18 years of age or older and 2 years have
 16  9 elapsed since the last official action in the person's case,
 16 10 the person has not been subsequently convicted of a felony
 16 11 or an aggravated or serious misdemeanor or adjudicated a
 16 12 delinquent child for an act which if committed by an adult
 16 13 would be a felony, an aggravated misdemeanor, or a serious

 16 16 youthful offender status, transferred back to district court

 16 18 the offense which precipitated the youthful offender placement.
 16 19 The bill in newly designated Code section 232.150(4) provides
 16 20 that the court shall not seal a person's juvenile court records
 16 21 if the person was adjudicated delinquent for violating Code
 16 22 section 321J.2, which prohibits the operation of a motor
 16 23 vehicle while under the influence of alcohol or a drug.
 16 24    RELEASE OF CONFIDENTIAL RECORDS.  The bill provides that a

 16 26 Code chapter 232 shall only be subject to release upon order of
 16 27 a court in a proceeding under Code chapter 232.
 16 28    EXISTING CONFIDENTIALITY EXEMPTIONS.  The bill retains
 16 29 certain existing exemptions to confidentiality of juvenile
 16 30 court records. Pursuant to Code section 692A.121(8), records
 16 31 concerning sex offense convictions which are committed by
 16 32 minors may be released in the same manner as records of
 16 33 convictions of adults. Pursuant to Code section 915.10A,
 16 34 information concerning a juvenile charged with a felony offense
 16 35 may be released pursuant to an automated victim notification
 17  1 system. Under the bill, these exemptions to confidentiality
 17  2 are not amended and therefore still apply to juvenile court
 17  3 records.
 17  4    RIGHT TO COUNSEL.  The bill in Code section 232.11 provides
 17  5 that a child has the right to be represented by counsel at a
 17  6 hearing on a confidentiality order under Code section 232.149A
 17  7 or a public records order under Code section 232.149B.
 17  8    APPLICABILITY.  The bill applies to juvenile delinquency
 17  9 proceedings which are pending or arise on or after July 1,

 13 27    The bill in newly designated Code section 232.147(14)
 13 28 provides that the provisions of the bill shall not be construed
 13 29 to limit or restrict the production, use, or introduction
 13 30 of official juvenile court records in any juvenile or adult
 13 31 criminal proceeding, where such records are relevant and deemed
 13 32 admissible under any other provision of the law.
 13 33    CONFIDENTIALITY OF RECORDS AND FILES OF CRIMINAL OR
 13 34 JUVENILE JUSTICE AGENCIES.  Under current law, records and
 13 35 files of a criminal or juvenile justice agency concerning
 14  1 a child involved in a delinquent act are public records,
 14  2 subject to certain exceptions. The bill in Code section
 14  3 232.149 provides that the records and files of a criminal or
 14  4 juvenile justice agency, an intake officer, or a juvenile court
 14  5 officer concerning a child involved in a delinquent act are
 14  6 confidential. The bill further provides that the records of an
 14  7 intake officer or juvenile court officer containing a dismissal
 14  8 of a complaint or an informal adjustment of a complaint when
 14  9 no petition is filed relating to the complaint, shall not be
 14 10 available to the public, but may be disclosed to the judge and
 14 11 professional court staff, including juvenile court officers;
 14 12 the child's counsel or guardian ad litem; the county attorney
 14 13 and county attorney's assistants;  the superintendent or the
 14 14 superintendent's designee of the school district for the
 14 15 school attended by the child or the authorities in charge of
 14 16 an accredited nonpublic school attended by the child; a member
 14 17 of the armed forces of the United States who is conducting a
 14 18 background investigation of an individual pursuant to federal
 14 19 law; the statistical analysis center for the purposes stated
 14 20 in Code section 216A.136; the state public defender;  the
 14 21 department of human services; and the alleged victim of the
 14 22 delinquent act.
 14 23    PUBLIC RECORDS HEARINGS.  The bill enacts new Code section
 14 24 232.149B, which provides that a person may apply for a court
 14 25 order to make confidential juvenile court records public.
 14 26 The bill provides that a rebuttable presumption exists that
 14 27 official juvenile court records shall remain confidential. The
 14 28 bill provides that the court shall order the official juvenile
 14 29 court records in such a delinquency proceeding to be public
 14 30 records if either the public's interest in making the records
 14 31 public outweighs the juvenile's interest in maintaining the
 14 32 confidentiality of the records or the juvenile has been placed
 14 33 on youthful offender status pursuant to Code section 232.45(7)
 14 34 and Code section 907.3A(1), and will be transferred back to
 14 35 the district court for sentencing prior to the child's 18th
 15  1 birthday. The court may order the official juvenile court
 15  2 records in such a delinquency proceeding to be public records
 15  3 if the juvenile has been subsequently adjudicated delinquent
 15  4 for a public offense that would be a serious misdemeanor,
 15  5 aggravated misdemeanor, or felony offense if committed by an
 15  6 adult, or another delinquency proceeding is pending seeking
 15  7 such an adjudication. The bill provides that records subject
 15  8 to a public records order may be sealed at a later date
 15  9 pursuant to Code section 232.150.
 15 10    RIGHT TO REVIEW AND RELEASE A CONFIDENTIAL COMPLAINT.  The
 15 11 bill provides that delinquency complaints shall be released
 15 12 in accordance with Code section 915.25. Under current Code
 15 13 section 915.25, a complaint which alleges that a child who is
 15 14 at least 10 years of age committed a delinquent act, which if
 15 15 committed by an adult would be a public offense, is a public
 15 16 record. Current Code section 915.25 authorizes the court,
 15 17 its designee, or law enforcement officials to release such
 15 18 a complaint, including the identity of the child. The bill
 15 19 amends Code section 915.25 to provide that such a complaint
 15 20 is confidential unless the complaint alleges that the child
 15 21 committed a delinquent act that if committed by an adult would
 15 22 be a forcible felony. However, the bill authorizes state and
 15 23 local enforcement officials to release a confidential complaint
 15 24 against a child if the child is at large and doing so is deemed
 15 25 necessary for the protection of the public or the safety of
 15 26 the child. If the complaint is not confidential because the
 15 27 alleged delinquent act is an act that would be a forcible
 15 28 felony if committed by an adult, the court, its designee,
 15 29 or law enforcement officials may release such a complaint,
 15 30 including the identity of the child.
 15 31    The bill provides that an intake or juvenile court officer
 15 32 shall disclose to the alleged victim of a delinquent act, upon
 15 33 request, the complaint, the name and address of the child who
 15 34 allegedly committed the delinquent act, and the disposition
 15 35 of the complaint. If the alleged delinquent act would be
 16  1 a forcible felony if committed by an adult, the intake or
 16  2 juvenile court officer shall provide notification to the victim
 16  3 as required by Code section 915.24.
 16  4    SEALING OF JUVENILE COURT RECORDS UNAVAILABLE FOR
 16  5 OPERATING=WHILE=INTOXICATED VIOLATIONS.  Under current Code
 16  6 section 232.150, a court shall order juvenile court records
 16  7 to be sealed if the person who is the subject of the juvenile
 16  8 court records is 18 years of age or older and 2 years have
 16  9 elapsed since the last official action in the person's case,
 16 10 the person has not been subsequently convicted of a felony
 16 11 or an aggravated or serious misdemeanor or adjudicated a
 16 12 delinquent child for an act which if committed by an adult
 16 13 would be a felony, an aggravated misdemeanor, or a serious
 16 14 misdemeanor and no proceeding is pending seeking such
 16 15 conviction or adjudication, and the person was not placed on
 16 16 youthful offender status, transferred back to district court
 16 17 after the youthful offender's 18th birthday, and sentenced for
 16 18 the offense which precipitated the youthful offender placement.
 16 19 The bill in newly designated Code section 232.150(4) provides
 16 20 that the court shall not seal a person's juvenile court records
 16 21 if the person was adjudicated delinquent for violating Code
 16 22 section 321J.2, which prohibits the operation of a motor
 16 23 vehicle while under the influence of alcohol or a drug.
 16 24    RELEASE OF CONFIDENTIAL RECORDS.  The bill provides that a
 16 25 public record which is confidential under the provisions of
 16 26 Code chapter 232 shall only be subject to release upon order of
 16 27 a court in a proceeding under Code chapter 232.
 16 28    EXISTING CONFIDENTIALITY EXEMPTIONS.  The bill retains
 16 29 certain existing exemptions to confidentiality of juvenile
 16 30 court records. Pursuant to Code section 692A.121(8), records
 16 31 concerning sex offense convictions which are committed by
 16 32 minors may be released in the same manner as records of
 16 33 convictions of adults. Pursuant to Code section 915.10A,
 16 34 information concerning a juvenile charged with a felony offense
 16 35 may be released pursuant to an automated victim notification

 17  2 are not amended and therefore still apply to juvenile court
 17  3 records.
 17  4    RIGHT TO COUNSEL.  The bill in Code section 232.11 provides
 17  5 that a child has the right to be represented by counsel at a
 17  6 hearing on a confidentiality order under Code section 232.149A
 17  7 or a public records order under Code section 232.149B.

 13 28 provides that the provisions of the bill shall not be construed
 13 29 to limit or restrict the production, use, or introduction
 13 30 of official juvenile court records in any juvenile or adult
 13 31 criminal proceeding, where such records are relevant and deemed
 13 32 admissible under any other provision of the law.
 13 33    CONFIDENTIALITY OF RECORDS AND FILES OF CRIMINAL OR
 13 34 JUVENILE JUSTICE AGENCIES.  Under current law, records and
 13 35 files of a criminal or juvenile justice agency concerning
 14  1 a child involved in a delinquent act are public records,
 14  2 subject to certain exceptions. The bill in Code section
 14  3 232.149 provides that the records and files of a criminal or
 14  4 juvenile justice agency, an intake officer, or a juvenile court
 14  5 officer concerning a child involved in a delinquent act are
 14  6 confidential. The bill further provides that the records of an
 14  7 intake officer or juvenile court officer containing a dismissal
 14  8 of a complaint or an informal adjustment of a complaint when
 14  9 no petition is filed relating to the complaint, shall not be
 14 10 available to the public, but may be disclosed to the judge and
 14 11 professional court staff, including juvenile court officers;
 14 12 the child's counsel or guardian ad litem; the county attorney
 14 13 and county attorney's assistants;  the superintendent or the
 14 14 superintendent's designee of the school district for the
 14 15 school attended by the child or the authorities in charge of
 14 16 an accredited nonpublic school attended by the child; a member
 14 17 of the armed forces of the United States who is conducting a
 14 18 background investigation of an individual pursuant to federal
 14 19 law; the statistical analysis center for the purposes stated
 14 20 in Code section 216A.136; the state public defender;  the
 14 21 department of human services; and the alleged victim of the
 14 22 delinquent act.
 14 23    PUBLIC RECORDS HEARINGS.  The bill enacts new Code section
 14 24 232.149B, which provides that a person may apply for a court
 14 25 order to make confidential juvenile court records public.
 14 26 The bill provides that a rebuttable presumption exists that
 14 27 official juvenile court records shall remain confidential. The
 14 28 bill provides that the court shall order the official juvenile
 14 29 court records in such a delinquency proceeding to be public
 14 30 records if either the public's interest in making the records
 14 31 public outweighs the juvenile's interest in maintaining the
 14 32 confidentiality of the records or the juvenile has been placed
 14 33 on youthful offender status pursuant to Code section 232.45(7)
 14 34 and Code section 907.3A(1), and will be transferred back to
 14 35 the district court for sentencing prior to the child's 18th
 15  1 birthday. The court may order the official juvenile court
 15  2 records in such a delinquency proceeding to be public records
 15  3 if the juvenile has been subsequently adjudicated delinquent
 15  4 for a public offense that would be a serious misdemeanor,
 15  5 aggravated misdemeanor, or felony offense if committed by an
 15  6 adult, or another delinquency proceeding is pending seeking
 15  7 such an adjudication. The bill provides that records subject
 15  8 to a public records order may be sealed at a later date
 15  9 pursuant to Code section 232.150.
 15 10    RIGHT TO REVIEW AND RELEASE A CONFIDENTIAL COMPLAINT.  The
 15 11 bill provides that delinquency complaints shall be released
 15 12 in accordance with Code section 915.25. Under current Code
 15 13 section 915.25, a complaint which alleges that a child who is
 15 14 at least 10 years of age committed a delinquent act, which if
 15 15 committed by an adult would be a public offense, is a public
 15 16 record. Current Code section 915.25 authorizes the court,
 15 17 its designee, or law enforcement officials to release such
 15 18 a complaint, including the identity of the child. The bill
 15 19 amends Code section 915.25 to provide that such a complaint
 15 20 is confidential unless the complaint alleges that the child
 15 21 committed a delinquent act that if committed by an adult would
 15 22 be a forcible felony. However, the bill authorizes state and
 15 23 local enforcement officials to release a confidential complaint
 15 24 against a child if the child is at large and doing so is deemed
 15 25 necessary for the protection of the public or the safety of
 15 26 the child. If the complaint is not confidential because the
 15 27 alleged delinquent act is an act that would be a forcible
 15 28 felony if committed by an adult, the court, its designee,
 15 29 or law enforcement officials may release such a complaint,
 15 30 including the identity of the child.
 15 31    The bill provides that an intake or juvenile court officer
 15 32 shall disclose to the alleged victim of a delinquent act, upon
 15 33 request, the complaint, the name and address of the child who
 15 34 allegedly committed the delinquent act, and the disposition
 15 35 of the complaint. If the alleged delinquent act would be
 16  1 a forcible felony if committed by an adult, the intake or
 16  2 juvenile court officer shall provide notification to the victim
 16  3 as required by Code section 915.24.
 16  4    SEALING OF JUVENILE COURT RECORDS UNAVAILABLE FOR
 16  5 OPERATING=WHILE=INTOXICATED VIOLATIONS.  Under current Code
 16  6 section 232.150, a court shall order juvenile court records
 16  7 to be sealed if the person who is the subject of the juvenile
 16  8 court records is 18 years of age or older and 2 years have
 16  9 elapsed since the last official action in the person's case,
 16 10 the person has not been subsequently convicted of a felony
 16 11 or an aggravated or serious misdemeanor or adjudicated a

 16 13 would be a felony, an aggravated misdemeanor, or a serious

 16 18 the offense which precipitated the youthful offender placement.
 16 19 The bill in newly designated Code section 232.150(4) provides

 16 21 if the person was adjudicated delinquent for violating Code
 16 22 section 321J.2, which prohibits the operation of a motor
 16 23 vehicle while under the influence of alcohol or a drug.
 16 24    RELEASE OF CONFIDENTIAL RECORDS.  The bill provides that a
 16 25 public record which is confidential under the provisions of
 16 26 Code chapter 232 shall only be subject to release upon order of
 16 27 a court in a proceeding under Code chapter 232.
 16 28    EXISTING CONFIDENTIALITY EXEMPTIONS.  The bill retains

 16 31 concerning sex offense convictions which are committed by

 13 33    CONFIDENTIALITY OF RECORDS AND FILES OF CRIMINAL OR
 13 34 JUVENILE JUSTICE AGENCIES.  Under current law, records and
 13 35 files of a criminal or juvenile justice agency concerning
 14  1 a child involved in a delinquent act are public records,
 14  2 subject to certain exceptions. The bill in Code section
 14  3 232.149 provides that the records and files of a criminal or
 14  4 juvenile justice agency, an intake officer, or a juvenile court
 14  5 officer concerning a child involved in a delinquent act are

 14 21 department of human services; and the alleged victim of the
 14 22 delinquent act.
 14 23    PUBLIC RECORDS HEARINGS.  The bill enacts new Code section
 14 24 232.149B, which provides that a person may apply for a court
 14 25 order to make confidential juvenile court records public.
 14 26 The bill provides that a rebuttable presumption exists that
 14 27 official juvenile court records shall remain confidential. The
 14 28 bill provides that the court shall order the official juvenile
 14 29 court records in such a delinquency proceeding to be public
 14 30 records if either the public's interest in making the records
 14 31 public outweighs the juvenile's interest in maintaining the
 14 32 confidentiality of the records or the juvenile has been placed
 14 33 on youthful offender status pursuant to Code section 232.45(7)
 14 34 and Code section 907.3A(1), and will be transferred back to
 14 35 the district court for sentencing prior to the child's 18th
 15  1 birthday. The court may order the official juvenile court
 15  2 records in such a delinquency proceeding to be public records
 15  3 if the juvenile has been subsequently adjudicated delinquent
 15  4 for a public offense that would be a serious misdemeanor,
 15  5 aggravated misdemeanor, or felony offense if committed by an
 15  6 adult, or another delinquency proceeding is pending seeking
 15  7 such an adjudication. The bill provides that records subject
 15  8 to a public records order may be sealed at a later date
 15  9 pursuant to Code section 232.150.
 15 10    RIGHT TO REVIEW AND RELEASE A CONFIDENTIAL COMPLAINT.  The
 15 11 bill provides that delinquency complaints shall be released
 15 12 in accordance with Code section 915.25. Under current Code
 15 13 section 915.25, a complaint which alleges that a child who is
 15 14 at least 10 years of age committed a delinquent act, which if
 15 15 committed by an adult would be a public offense, is a public
 15 16 record. Current Code section 915.25 authorizes the court,
 15 17 its designee, or law enforcement officials to release such
 15 18 a complaint, including the identity of the child. The bill
 15 19 amends Code section 915.25 to provide that such a complaint
 15 20 is confidential unless the complaint alleges that the child
 15 21 committed a delinquent act that if committed by an adult would
 15 22 be a forcible felony. However, the bill authorizes state and
 15 23 local enforcement officials to release a confidential complaint
 15 24 against a child if the child is at large and doing so is deemed
 15 25 necessary for the protection of the public or the safety of
 15 26 the child. If the complaint is not confidential because the
 15 27 alleged delinquent act is an act that would be a forcible
 15 28 felony if committed by an adult, the court, its designee,
 15 29 or law enforcement officials may release such a complaint,
 15 30 including the identity of the child.
 15 31    The bill provides that an intake or juvenile court officer
 15 32 shall disclose to the alleged victim of a delinquent act, upon
 15 33 request, the complaint, the name and address of the child who
 15 34 allegedly committed the delinquent act, and the disposition
 15 35 of the complaint. If the alleged delinquent act would be
 16  1 a forcible felony if committed by an adult, the intake or
 16  2 juvenile court officer shall provide notification to the victim
 16  3 as required by Code section 915.24.
 16  4    SEALING OF JUVENILE COURT RECORDS UNAVAILABLE FOR
 16  5 OPERATING=WHILE=INTOXICATED VIOLATIONS.  Under current Code
 16  6 section 232.150, a court shall order juvenile court records
 16  7 to be sealed if the person who is the subject of the juvenile
 16  8 court records is 18 years of age or older and 2 years have
 16  9 elapsed since the last official action in the person's case,
 16 10 the person has not been subsequently convicted of a felony
 16 11 or an aggravated or serious misdemeanor or adjudicated a
 16 12 delinquent child for an act which if committed by an adult
 16 13 would be a felony, an aggravated misdemeanor, or a serious
 16 14 misdemeanor and no proceeding is pending seeking such
 16 15 conviction or adjudication, and the person was not placed on
 16 16 youthful offender status, transferred back to district court
 16 17 after the youthful offender's 18th birthday, and sentenced for
 16 18 the offense which precipitated the youthful offender placement.
 16 19 The bill in newly designated Code section 232.150(4) provides
 16 20 that the court shall not seal a person's juvenile court records
 16 21 if the person was adjudicated delinquent for violating Code
 16 22 section 321J.2, which prohibits the operation of a motor
 16 23 vehicle while under the influence of alcohol or a drug.
 16 24    RELEASE OF CONFIDENTIAL RECORDS.  The bill provides that a
 16 25 public record which is confidential under the provisions of
 16 26 Code chapter 232 shall only be subject to release upon order of
 16 27 a court in a proceeding under Code chapter 232.
 16 28    EXISTING CONFIDENTIALITY EXEMPTIONS.  The bill retains
 16 29 certain existing exemptions to confidentiality of juvenile
 16 30 court records. Pursuant to Code section 692A.121(8), records
 16 31 concerning sex offense convictions which are committed by
 16 32 minors may be released in the same manner as records of
 16 33 convictions of adults. Pursuant to Code section 915.10A,
 16 34 information concerning a juvenile charged with a felony offense
 16 35 may be released pursuant to an automated victim notification
 17  1 system. Under the bill, these exemptions to confidentiality
 17  2 are not amended and therefore still apply to juvenile court
 17  3 records.
 17  4    RIGHT TO COUNSEL.  The bill in Code section 232.11 provides
 17  5 that a child has the right to be represented by counsel at a

 13 30 of official juvenile court records in any juvenile or adult
 13 31 criminal proceeding, where such records are relevant and deemed
 13 32 admissible under any other provision of the law.
 13 33    CONFIDENTIALITY OF RECORDS AND FILES OF CRIMINAL OR
 13 34 JUVENILE JUSTICE AGENCIES.  Under current law, records and
 13 35 files of a criminal or juvenile justice agency concerning
 14  1 a child involved in a delinquent act are public records,
 14  2 subject to certain exceptions. The bill in Code section
 14  3 232.149 provides that the records and files of a criminal or
 14  4 juvenile justice agency, an intake officer, or a juvenile court
 14  5 officer concerning a child involved in a delinquent act are
 14  6 confidential. The bill further provides that the records of an
 14  7 intake officer or juvenile court officer containing a dismissal
 14  8 of a complaint or an informal adjustment of a complaint when
 14  9 no petition is filed relating to the complaint, shall not be
 14 10 available to the public, but may be disclosed to the judge and
 14 11 professional court staff, including juvenile court officers;
 14 12 the child's counsel or guardian ad litem; the county attorney
 14 13 and county attorney's assistants;  the superintendent or the
 14 14 superintendent's designee of the school district for the
 14 15 school attended by the child or the authorities in charge of
 14 16 an accredited nonpublic school attended by the child; a member
 14 17 of the armed forces of the United States who is conducting a
 14 18 background investigation of an individual pursuant to federal
 14 19 law; the statistical analysis center for the purposes stated
 14 20 in Code section 216A.136; the state public defender;  the
 14 21 department of human services; and the alleged victim of the
 14 22 delinquent act.
 14 23    PUBLIC RECORDS HEARINGS.  The bill enacts new Code section
 14 24 232.149B, which provides that a person may apply for a court
 14 25 order to make confidential juvenile court records public.
 14 26 The bill provides that a rebuttable presumption exists that
 14 27 official juvenile court records shall remain confidential. The
 14 28 bill provides that the court shall order the official juvenile
 14 29 court records in such a delinquency proceeding to be public
 14 30 records if either the public's interest in making the records
 14 31 public outweighs the juvenile's interest in maintaining the
 14 32 confidentiality of the records or the juvenile has been placed
 14 33 on youthful offender status pursuant to Code section 232.45(7)
 14 34 and Code section 907.3A(1), and will be transferred back to
 14 35 the district court for sentencing prior to the child's 18th
 15  1 birthday. The court may order the official juvenile court
 15  2 records in such a delinquency proceeding to be public records
 15  3 if the juvenile has been subsequently adjudicated delinquent
 15  4 for a public offense that would be a serious misdemeanor,
 15  5 aggravated misdemeanor, or felony offense if committed by an
 15  6 adult, or another delinquency proceeding is pending seeking
 15  7 such an adjudication. The bill provides that records subject
 15  8 to a public records order may be sealed at a later date
 15  9 pursuant to Code section 232.150.
 15 10    RIGHT TO REVIEW AND RELEASE A CONFIDENTIAL COMPLAINT.  The
 15 11 bill provides that delinquency complaints shall be released
 15 12 in accordance with Code section 915.25. Under current Code
 15 13 section 915.25, a complaint which alleges that a child who is
 15 14 at least 10 years of age committed a delinquent act, which if
 15 15 committed by an adult would be a public offense, is a public
 15 16 record. Current Code section 915.25 authorizes the court,
 15 17 its designee, or law enforcement officials to release such
 15 18 a complaint, including the identity of the child. The bill
 15 19 amends Code section 915.25 to provide that such a complaint
 15 20 is confidential unless the complaint alleges that the child
 15 21 committed a delinquent act that if committed by an adult would
 15 22 be a forcible felony. However, the bill authorizes state and
 15 23 local enforcement officials to release a confidential complaint
 15 24 against a child if the child is at large and doing so is deemed
 15 25 necessary for the protection of the public or the safety of
 15 26 the child. If the complaint is not confidential because the
 15 27 alleged delinquent act is an act that would be a forcible
 15 28 felony if committed by an adult, the court, its designee,
 15 29 or law enforcement officials may release such a complaint,
 15 30 including the identity of the child.
 15 31    The bill provides that an intake or juvenile court officer
 15 32 shall disclose to the alleged victim of a delinquent act, upon
 15 33 request, the complaint, the name and address of the child who
 15 34 allegedly committed the delinquent act, and the disposition
 15 35 of the complaint. If the alleged delinquent act would be
 16  1 a forcible felony if committed by an adult, the intake or
 16  2 juvenile court officer shall provide notification to the victim
 16  3 as required by Code section 915.24.
 16  4    SEALING OF JUVENILE COURT RECORDS UNAVAILABLE FOR
 16  5 OPERATING=WHILE=INTOXICATED VIOLATIONS.  Under current Code
 16  6 section 232.150, a court shall order juvenile court records
 16  7 to be sealed if the person who is the subject of the juvenile
 16  8 court records is 18 years of age or older and 2 years have
 16  9 elapsed since the last official action in the person's case,
 16 10 the person has not been subsequently convicted of a felony
 16 11 or an aggravated or serious misdemeanor or adjudicated a
 16 12 delinquent child for an act which if committed by an adult
 16 13 would be a felony, an aggravated misdemeanor, or a serious
 16 14 misdemeanor and no proceeding is pending seeking such
 16 15 conviction or adjudication, and the person was not placed on
 16 16 youthful offender status, transferred back to district court
 16 17 after the youthful offender's 18th birthday, and sentenced for
 16 18 the offense which precipitated the youthful offender placement.
 16 19 The bill in newly designated Code section 232.150(4) provides
 16 20 that the court shall not seal a person's juvenile court records
 16 21 if the person was adjudicated delinquent for violating Code
 16 22 section 321J.2, which prohibits the operation of a motor
 16 23 vehicle while under the influence of alcohol or a drug.
 16 24    RELEASE OF CONFIDENTIAL RECORDS.  The bill provides that a
 16 25 public record which is confidential under the provisions of
 16 26 Code chapter 232 shall only be subject to release upon order of
 16 27 a court in a proceeding under Code chapter 232.
 16 28    EXISTING CONFIDENTIALITY EXEMPTIONS.  The bill retains
 16 29 certain existing exemptions to confidentiality of juvenile
 16 30 court records. Pursuant to Code section 692A.121(8), records
 16 31 concerning sex offense convictions which are committed by
 16 32 minors may be released in the same manner as records of
 16 33 convictions of adults. Pursuant to Code section 915.10A,
 16 34 information concerning a juvenile charged with a felony offense
 16 35 may be released pursuant to an automated victim notification
 17  1 system. Under the bill, these exemptions to confidentiality
 17  2 are not amended and therefore still apply to juvenile court
 17  3 records.
 17  4    RIGHT TO COUNSEL.  The bill in Code section 232.11 provides
 17  5 that a child has the right to be represented by counsel at a
 17  6 hearing on a confidentiality order under Code section 232.149A
 17  7 or a public records order under Code section 232.149B.
 17  8    APPLICABILITY.  The bill applies to juvenile delinquency
 17  9 proceedings which are pending or arise on or after July 1,
 17 10 2016.

 13 30 of official juvenile court records in any juvenile or adult
 13 31 criminal proceeding, where such records are relevant and deemed
 13 32 admissible under any other provision of the law.
 13 33    CONFIDENTIALITY OF RECORDS AND FILES OF CRIMINAL OR
 13 34 JUVENILE JUSTICE AGENCIES.  Under current law, records and
 13 35 files of a criminal or juvenile justice agency concerning
 14  1 a child involved in a delinquent act are public records,
 14  2 subject to certain exceptions. The bill in Code section
 14  3 232.149 provides that the records and files of a criminal or
 14  4 juvenile justice agency, an intake officer, or a juvenile court
 14  5 officer concerning a child involved in a delinquent act are
 14  6 confidential. The bill further provides that the records of an
 14  7 intake officer or juvenile court officer containing a dismissal
 14  8 of a complaint or an informal adjustment of a complaint when
 14  9 no petition is filed relating to the complaint, shall not be
 14 10 available to the public, but may be disclosed to the judge and
 14 11 professional court staff, including juvenile court officers;
 14 12 the child's counsel or guardian ad litem; the county attorney
 14 13 and county attorney's assistants;  the superintendent or the
 14 14 superintendent's designee of the school district for the
 14 15 school attended by the child or the authorities in charge of
 14 16 an accredited nonpublic school attended by the child; a member
 14 17 of the armed forces of the United States who is conducting a
 14 18 background investigation of an individual pursuant to federal
 14 19 law; the statistical analysis center for the purposes stated
 14 20 in Code section 216A.136; the state public defender;  the
 14 21 department of human services; and the alleged victim of the
 14 22 delinquent act.
 14 23    PUBLIC RECORDS HEARINGS.  The bill enacts new Code section
 14 24 232.149B, which provides that a person may apply for a court
 14 25 order to make confidential juvenile court records public.
 14 26 The bill provides that a rebuttable presumption exists that
 14 27 official juvenile court records shall remain confidential. The
 14 28 bill provides that the court shall order the official juvenile
 14 29 court records in such a delinquency proceeding to be public
 14 30 records if either the public's interest in making the records
 14 31 public outweighs the juvenile's interest in maintaining the
 14 32 confidentiality of the records or the juvenile has been placed
 14 33 on youthful offender status pursuant to Code section 232.45(7)
 14 34 and Code section 907.3A(1), and will be transferred back to
 14 35 the district court for sentencing prior to the child's 18th
 15  1 birthday. The court may order the official juvenile court
 15  2 records in such a delinquency proceeding to be public records
 15  3 if the juvenile has been subsequently adjudicated delinquent
 15  4 for a public offense that would be a serious misdemeanor,
 15  5 aggravated misdemeanor, or felony offense if committed by an
 15  6 adult, or another delinquency proceeding is pending seeking
 15  7 such an adjudication. The bill provides that records subject
 15  8 to a public records order may be sealed at a later date
 15  9 pursuant to Code section 232.150.
 15 10    RIGHT TO REVIEW AND RELEASE A CONFIDENTIAL COMPLAINT.  The
 15 11 bill provides that delinquency complaints shall be released
 15 12 in accordance with Code section 915.25. Under current Code
 15 13 section 915.25, a complaint which alleges that a child who is
 15 14 at least 10 years of age committed a delinquent act, which if
 15 15 committed by an adult would be a public offense, is a public
 15 16 record. Current Code section 915.25 authorizes the court,
 15 17 its designee, or law enforcement officials to release such
 15 18 a complaint, including the identity of the child. The bill
 15 19 amends Code section 915.25 to provide that such a complaint
 15 20 is confidential unless the complaint alleges that the child
 15 21 committed a delinquent act that if committed by an adult would
 15 22 be a forcible felony. However, the bill authorizes state and
 15 23 local enforcement officials to release a confidential complaint
 15 24 against a child if the child is at large and doing so is deemed
 15 25 necessary for the protection of the public or the safety of
 15 26 the child. If the complaint is not confidential because the
 15 27 alleged delinquent act is an act that would be a forcible
 15 28 felony if committed by an adult, the court, its designee,
 15 29 or law enforcement officials may release such a complaint,
 15 30 including the identity of the child.
 15 31    The bill provides that an intake or juvenile court officer
 15 32 shall disclose to the alleged victim of a delinquent act, upon
 15 33 request, the complaint, the name and address of the child who
 15 34 allegedly committed the delinquent act, and the disposition
 15 35 of the complaint. If the alleged delinquent act would be
 16  1 a forcible felony if committed by an adult, the intake or
 16  2 juvenile court officer shall provide notification to the victim
 16  3 as required by Code section 915.24.
 16  4    SEALING OF JUVENILE COURT RECORDS UNAVAILABLE FOR
 16  5 OPERATING=WHILE=INTOXICATED VIOLATIONS.  Under current Code
 16  6 section 232.150, a court shall order juvenile court records
 16  7 to be sealed if the person who is the subject of the juvenile
 16  8 court records is 18 years of age or older and 2 years have
 16  9 elapsed since the last official action in the person's case,
 16 10 the person has not been subsequently convicted of a felony
 16 11 or an aggravated or serious misdemeanor or adjudicated a
 16 12 delinquent child for an act which if committed by an adult
 16 13 would be a felony, an aggravated misdemeanor, or a serious
 16 14 misdemeanor and no proceeding is pending seeking such
 16 15 conviction or adjudication, and the person was not placed on
 16 16 youthful offender status, transferred back to district court
 16 17 after the youthful offender's 18th birthday, and sentenced for
 16 18 the offense which precipitated the youthful offender placement.
 16 19 The bill in newly designated Code section 232.150(4) provides
 16 20 that the court shall not seal a person's juvenile court records
 16 21 if the person was adjudicated delinquent for violating Code
 16 22 section 321J.2, which prohibits the operation of a motor

 16 24    RELEASE OF CONFIDENTIAL RECORDS.  The bill provides that a
 16 25 public record which is confidential under the provisions of
 16 26 Code chapter 232 shall only be subject to release upon order of
 16 27 a court in a proceeding under Code chapter 232.
 16 28    EXISTING CONFIDENTIALITY EXEMPTIONS.  The bill retains
 16 29 certain existing exemptions to confidentiality of juvenile
 16 30 court records. Pursuant to Code section 692A.121(8), records
 16 31 concerning sex offense convictions which are committed by

 13 33    CONFIDENTIALITY OF RECORDS AND FILES OF CRIMINAL OR
 13 34 JUVENILE JUSTICE AGENCIES.  Under current law, records and
 13 35 files of a criminal or juvenile justice agency concerning
 14  1 a child involved in a delinquent act are public records,
 14  2 subject to certain exceptions. The bill in Code section
 14  3 232.149 provides that the records and files of a criminal or
 14  4 juvenile justice agency, an intake officer, or a juvenile court
 14  5 officer concerning a child involved in a delinquent act are
 14  6 confidential. The bill further provides that the records of an
 14  7 intake officer or juvenile court officer containing a dismissal
 14  8 of a complaint or an informal adjustment of a complaint when

 14 20 in Code section 216A.136; the state public defender;  the
 14 21 department of human services; and the alleged victim of the
 14 22 delinquent act.
 14 23    PUBLIC RECORDS HEARINGS.  The bill enacts new Code section
 14 24 232.149B, which provides that a person may apply for a court
 14 25 order to make confidential juvenile court records public.
 14 26 The bill provides that a rebuttable presumption exists that
 14 27 official juvenile court records shall remain confidential. The
 14 28 bill provides that the court shall order the official juvenile
 14 29 court records in such a delinquency proceeding to be public
 14 30 records if either the public's interest in making the records
 14 31 public outweighs the juvenile's interest in maintaining the
 14 32 confidentiality of the records or the juvenile has been placed
 14 33 on youthful offender status pursuant to Code section 232.45(7)
 14 34 and Code section 907.3A(1), and will be transferred back to
 14 35 the district court for sentencing prior to the child's 18th
 15  1 birthday. The court may order the official juvenile court
 15  2 records in such a delinquency proceeding to be public records
 15  3 if the juvenile has been subsequently adjudicated delinquent
 15  4 for a public offense that would be a serious misdemeanor,
 15  5 aggravated misdemeanor, or felony offense if committed by an
 15  6 adult, or another delinquency proceeding is pending seeking
 15  7 such an adjudication. The bill provides that records subject
 15  8 to a public records order may be sealed at a later date
 15  9 pursuant to Code section 232.150.
 15 10    RIGHT TO REVIEW AND RELEASE A CONFIDENTIAL COMPLAINT.  The
 15 11 bill provides that delinquency complaints shall be released
 15 12 in accordance with Code section 915.25. Under current Code
 15 13 section 915.25, a complaint which alleges that a child who is
 15 14 at least 10 years of age committed a delinquent act, which if
 15 15 committed by an adult would be a public offense, is a public
 15 16 record. Current Code section 915.25 authorizes the court,
 15 17 its designee, or law enforcement officials to release such
 15 18 a complaint, including the identity of the child. The bill
 15 19 amends Code section 915.25 to provide that such a complaint
 15 20 is confidential unless the complaint alleges that the child
 15 21 committed a delinquent act that if committed by an adult would
 15 22 be a forcible felony. However, the bill authorizes state and
 15 23 local enforcement officials to release a confidential complaint
 15 24 against a child if the child is at large and doing so is deemed
 15 25 necessary for the protection of the public or the safety of
 15 26 the child. If the complaint is not confidential because the
 15 27 alleged delinquent act is an act that would be a forcible
 15 28 felony if committed by an adult, the court, its designee,
 15 29 or law enforcement officials may release such a complaint,
 15 30 including the identity of the child.
 15 31    The bill provides that an intake or juvenile court officer
 15 32 shall disclose to the alleged victim of a delinquent act, upon
 15 33 request, the complaint, the name and address of the child who
 15 34 allegedly committed the delinquent act, and the disposition
 15 35 of the complaint. If the alleged delinquent act would be
 16  1 a forcible felony if committed by an adult, the intake or
 16  2 juvenile court officer shall provide notification to the victim
 16  3 as required by Code section 915.24.
 16  4    SEALING OF JUVENILE COURT RECORDS UNAVAILABLE FOR
 16  5 OPERATING=WHILE=INTOXICATED VIOLATIONS.  Under current Code
 16  6 section 232.150, a court shall order juvenile court records
 16  7 to be sealed if the person who is the subject of the juvenile
 16  8 court records is 18 years of age or older and 2 years have
 16  9 elapsed since the last official action in the person's case,
 16 10 the person has not been subsequently convicted of a felony
 16 11 or an aggravated or serious misdemeanor or adjudicated a
 16 12 delinquent child for an act which if committed by an adult
 16 13 would be a felony, an aggravated misdemeanor, or a serious
 16 14 misdemeanor and no proceeding is pending seeking such
 16 15 conviction or adjudication, and the person was not placed on
 16 16 youthful offender status, transferred back to district court
 16 17 after the youthful offender's 18th birthday, and sentenced for
 16 18 the offense which precipitated the youthful offender placement.
 16 19 The bill in newly designated Code section 232.150(4) provides
 16 20 that the court shall not seal a person's juvenile court records
 16 21 if the person was adjudicated delinquent for violating Code
 16 22 section 321J.2, which prohibits the operation of a motor
 16 23 vehicle while under the influence of alcohol or a drug.
 16 24    RELEASE OF CONFIDENTIAL RECORDS.  The bill provides that a
 16 25 public record which is confidential under the provisions of
 16 26 Code chapter 232 shall only be subject to release upon order of
 16 27 a court in a proceeding under Code chapter 232.
 16 28    EXISTING CONFIDENTIALITY EXEMPTIONS.  The bill retains
 16 29 certain existing exemptions to confidentiality of juvenile
 16 30 court records. Pursuant to Code section 692A.121(8), records
 16 31 concerning sex offense convictions which are committed by
 16 32 minors may be released in the same manner as records of
 16 33 convictions of adults. Pursuant to Code section 915.10A,
 16 34 information concerning a juvenile charged with a felony offense
 16 35 may be released pursuant to an automated victim notification
 17  1 system. Under the bill, these exemptions to confidentiality
 17  2 are not amended and therefore still apply to juvenile court
 17  3 records.
 17  4    RIGHT TO COUNSEL.  The bill in Code section 232.11 provides
 17  5 that a child has the right to be represented by counsel at a

 17  7 or a public records order under Code section 232.149B.

 13 33    CONFIDENTIALITY OF RECORDS AND FILES OF CRIMINAL OR
 13 34 JUVENILE JUSTICE AGENCIES.  Under current law, records and
 13 35 files of a criminal or juvenile justice agency concerning
 14  1 a child involved in a delinquent act are public records,
 14  2 subject to certain exceptions. The bill in Code section
 14  3 232.149 provides that the records and files of a criminal or
 14  4 juvenile justice agency, an intake officer, or a juvenile court
 14  5 officer concerning a child involved in a delinquent act are
 14  6 confidential. The bill further provides that the records of an
 14  7 intake officer or juvenile court officer containing a dismissal
 14  8 of a complaint or an informal adjustment of a complaint when
 14  9 no petition is filed relating to the complaint, shall not be
 14 10 available to the public, but may be disclosed to the judge and

 14 13 and county attorney's assistants;  the superintendent or the

 14 21 department of human services; and the alleged victim of the
 14 22 delinquent act.
 14 23    PUBLIC RECORDS HEARINGS.  The bill enacts new Code section
 14 24 232.149B, which provides that a person may apply for a court
 14 25 order to make confidential juvenile court records public.
 14 26 The bill provides that a rebuttable presumption exists that
 14 27 official juvenile court records shall remain confidential. The
 14 28 bill provides that the court shall order the official juvenile
 14 29 court records in such a delinquency proceeding to be public
 14 30 records if either the public's interest in making the records
 14 31 public outweighs the juvenile's interest in maintaining the
 14 32 confidentiality of the records or the juvenile has been placed
 14 33 on youthful offender status pursuant to Code section 232.45(7)
 14 34 and Code section 907.3A(1), and will be transferred back to
 14 35 the district court for sentencing prior to the child's 18th
 15  1 birthday. The court may order the official juvenile court
 15  2 records in such a delinquency proceeding to be public records
 15  3 if the juvenile has been subsequently adjudicated delinquent
 15  4 for a public offense that would be a serious misdemeanor,
 15  5 aggravated misdemeanor, or felony offense if committed by an
 15  6 adult, or another delinquency proceeding is pending seeking
 15  7 such an adjudication. The bill provides that records subject
 15  8 to a public records order may be sealed at a later date
 15  9 pursuant to Code section 232.150.
 15 10    RIGHT TO REVIEW AND RELEASE A CONFIDENTIAL COMPLAINT.  The
 15 11 bill provides that delinquency complaints shall be released
 15 12 in accordance with Code section 915.25. Under current Code
 15 13 section 915.25, a complaint which alleges that a child who is
 15 14 at least 10 years of age committed a delinquent act, which if
 15 15 committed by an adult would be a public offense, is a public
 15 16 record. Current Code section 915.25 authorizes the court,
 15 17 its designee, or law enforcement officials to release such
 15 18 a complaint, including the identity of the child. The bill
 15 19 amends Code section 915.25 to provide that such a complaint
 15 20 is confidential unless the complaint alleges that the child
 15 21 committed a delinquent act that if committed by an adult would
 15 22 be a forcible felony. However, the bill authorizes state and
 15 23 local enforcement officials to release a confidential complaint
 15 24 against a child if the child is at large and doing so is deemed
 15 25 necessary for the protection of the public or the safety of
 15 26 the child. If the complaint is not confidential because the
 15 27 alleged delinquent act is an act that would be a forcible
 15 28 felony if committed by an adult, the court, its designee,
 15 29 or law enforcement officials may release such a complaint,
 15 30 including the identity of the child.
 15 31    The bill provides that an intake or juvenile court officer
 15 32 shall disclose to the alleged victim of a delinquent act, upon
 15 33 request, the complaint, the name and address of the child who
 15 34 allegedly committed the delinquent act, and the disposition
 15 35 of the complaint. If the alleged delinquent act would be
 16  1 a forcible felony if committed by an adult, the intake or
 16  2 juvenile court officer shall provide notification to the victim
 16  3 as required by Code section 915.24.
 16  4    SEALING OF JUVENILE COURT RECORDS UNAVAILABLE FOR
 16  5 OPERATING=WHILE=INTOXICATED VIOLATIONS.  Under current Code
 16  6 section 232.150, a court shall order juvenile court records
 16  7 to be sealed if the person who is the subject of the juvenile
 16  8 court records is 18 years of age or older and 2 years have
 16  9 elapsed since the last official action in the person's case,
 16 10 the person has not been subsequently convicted of a felony
 16 11 or an aggravated or serious misdemeanor or adjudicated a
 16 12 delinquent child for an act which if committed by an adult
 16 13 would be a felony, an aggravated misdemeanor, or a serious
 16 14 misdemeanor and no proceeding is pending seeking such
 16 15 conviction or adjudication, and the person was not placed on
 16 16 youthful offender status, transferred back to district court
 16 17 after the youthful offender's 18th birthday, and sentenced for
 16 18 the offense which precipitated the youthful offender placement.
 16 19 The bill in newly designated Code section 232.150(4) provides
 16 20 that the court shall not seal a person's juvenile court records
 16 21 if the person was adjudicated delinquent for violating Code
 16 22 section 321J.2, which prohibits the operation of a motor
 16 23 vehicle while under the influence of alcohol or a drug.
 16 24    RELEASE OF CONFIDENTIAL RECORDS.  The bill provides that a
 16 25 public record which is confidential under the provisions of
 16 26 Code chapter 232 shall only be subject to release upon order of
 16 27 a court in a proceeding under Code chapter 232.
 16 28    EXISTING CONFIDENTIALITY EXEMPTIONS.  The bill retains
 16 29 certain existing exemptions to confidentiality of juvenile
 16 30 court records. Pursuant to Code section 692A.121(8), records
 16 31 concerning sex offense convictions which are committed by
 16 32 minors may be released in the same manner as records of
 16 33 convictions of adults. Pursuant to Code section 915.10A,
 16 34 information concerning a juvenile charged with a felony offense
 16 35 may be released pursuant to an automated victim notification
 17  1 system. Under the bill, these exemptions to confidentiality
 17  2 are not amended and therefore still apply to juvenile court
 17  3 records.
 17  4    RIGHT TO COUNSEL.  The bill in Code section 232.11 provides
 17  5 that a child has the right to be represented by counsel at a
 17  6 hearing on a confidentiality order under Code section 232.149A
 17  7 or a public records order under Code section 232.149B.
 17  8    APPLICABILITY.  The bill applies to juvenile delinquency
 17  9 proceedings which are pending or arise on or after July 1,
 17 10 2016.

 13 31 criminal proceeding, where such records are relevant and deemed
 13 32 admissible under any other provision of the law.
 13 33    CONFIDENTIALITY OF RECORDS AND FILES OF CRIMINAL OR
 13 34 JUVENILE JUSTICE AGENCIES.  Under current law, records and
 13 35 files of a criminal or juvenile justice agency concerning
 14  1 a child involved in a delinquent act are public records,
 14  2 subject to certain exceptions. The bill in Code section
 14  3 232.149 provides that the records and files of a criminal or
 14  4 juvenile justice agency, an intake officer, or a juvenile court
 14  5 officer concerning a child involved in a delinquent act are
 14  6 confidential. The bill further provides that the records of an
 14  7 intake officer or juvenile court officer containing a dismissal
 14  8 of a complaint or an informal adjustment of a complaint when
 14  9 no petition is filed relating to the complaint, shall not be
 14 10 available to the public, but may be disclosed to the judge and
 14 11 professional court staff, including juvenile court officers;
 14 12 the child's counsel or guardian ad litem; the county attorney
 14 13 and county attorney's assistants;  the superintendent or the
 14 14 superintendent's designee of the school district for the
 14 15 school attended by the child or the authorities in charge of
 14 16 an accredited nonpublic school attended by the child; a member
 14 17 of the armed forces of the United States who is conducting a
 14 18 background investigation of an individual pursuant to federal
 14 19 law; the statistical analysis center for the purposes stated
 14 20 in Code section 216A.136; the state public defender;  the
 14 21 department of human services; and the alleged victim of the
 14 22 delinquent act.
 14 23    PUBLIC RECORDS HEARINGS.  The bill enacts new Code section
 14 24 232.149B, which provides that a person may apply for a court
 14 25 order to make confidential juvenile court records public.
 14 26 The bill provides that a rebuttable presumption exists that
 14 27 official juvenile court records shall remain confidential. The
 14 28 bill provides that the court shall order the official juvenile
 14 29 court records in such a delinquency proceeding to be public
 14 30 records if either the public's interest in making the records
 14 31 public outweighs the juvenile's interest in maintaining the
 14 32 confidentiality of the records or the juvenile has been placed
 14 33 on youthful offender status pursuant to Code section 232.45(7)
 14 34 and Code section 907.3A(1), and will be transferred back to
 14 35 the district court for sentencing prior to the child's 18th
 15  1 birthday. The court may order the official juvenile court
 15  2 records in such a delinquency proceeding to be public records
 15  3 if the juvenile has been subsequently adjudicated delinquent
 15  4 for a public offense that would be a serious misdemeanor,
 15  5 aggravated misdemeanor, or felony offense if committed by an
 15  6 adult, or another delinquency proceeding is pending seeking
 15  7 such an adjudication. The bill provides that records subject
 15  8 to a public records order may be sealed at a later date
 15  9 pursuant to Code section 232.150.
 15 10    RIGHT TO REVIEW AND RELEASE A CONFIDENTIAL COMPLAINT.  The
 15 11 bill provides that delinquency complaints shall be released
 15 12 in accordance with Code section 915.25. Under current Code
 15 13 section 915.25, a complaint which alleges that a child who is
 15 14 at least 10 years of age committed a delinquent act, which if
 15 15 committed by an adult would be a public offense, is a public
 15 16 record. Current Code section 915.25 authorizes the court,
 15 17 its designee, or law enforcement officials to release such
 15 18 a complaint, including the identity of the child. The bill
 15 19 amends Code section 915.25 to provide that such a complaint
 15 20 is confidential unless the complaint alleges that the child
 15 21 committed a delinquent act that if committed by an adult would
 15 22 be a forcible felony. However, the bill authorizes state and
 15 23 local enforcement officials to release a confidential complaint
 15 24 against a child if the child is at large and doing so is deemed
 15 25 necessary for the protection of the public or the safety of
 15 26 the child. If the complaint is not confidential because the
 15 27 alleged delinquent act is an act that would be a forcible
 15 28 felony if committed by an adult, the court, its designee,
 15 29 or law enforcement officials may release such a complaint,
 15 30 including the identity of the child.
 15 31    The bill provides that an intake or juvenile court officer
 15 32 shall disclose to the alleged victim of a delinquent act, upon
 15 33 request, the complaint, the name and address of the child who
 15 34 allegedly committed the delinquent act, and the disposition
 15 35 of the complaint. If the alleged delinquent act would be
 16  1 a forcible felony if committed by an adult, the intake or
 16  2 juvenile court officer shall provide notification to the victim
 16  3 as required by Code section 915.24.
 16  4    SEALING OF JUVENILE COURT RECORDS UNAVAILABLE FOR
 16  5 OPERATING=WHILE=INTOXICATED VIOLATIONS.  Under current Code
 16  6 section 232.150, a court shall order juvenile court records
 16  7 to be sealed if the person who is the subject of the juvenile
 16  8 court records is 18 years of age or older and 2 years have
 16  9 elapsed since the last official action in the person's case,
 16 10 the person has not been subsequently convicted of a felony
 16 11 or an aggravated or serious misdemeanor or adjudicated a
 16 12 delinquent child for an act which if committed by an adult
 16 13 would be a felony, an aggravated misdemeanor, or a serious
 16 14 misdemeanor and no proceeding is pending seeking such
 16 15 conviction or adjudication, and the person was not placed on
 16 16 youthful offender status, transferred back to district court
 16 17 after the youthful offender's 18th birthday, and sentenced for
 16 18 the offense which precipitated the youthful offender placement.
 16 19 The bill in newly designated Code section 232.150(4) provides
 16 20 that the court shall not seal a person's juvenile court records
 16 21 if the person was adjudicated delinquent for violating Code
 16 22 section 321J.2, which prohibits the operation of a motor
 16 23 vehicle while under the influence of alcohol or a drug.
 16 24    RELEASE OF CONFIDENTIAL RECORDS.  The bill provides that a
 16 25 public record which is confidential under the provisions of
 16 26 Code chapter 232 shall only be subject to release upon order of
 16 27 a court in a proceeding under Code chapter 232.
 16 28    EXISTING CONFIDENTIALITY EXEMPTIONS.  The bill retains
 16 29 certain existing exemptions to confidentiality of juvenile
 16 30 court records. Pursuant to Code section 692A.121(8), records
 16 31 concerning sex offense convictions which are committed by
 16 32 minors may be released in the same manner as records of
 16 33 convictions of adults. Pursuant to Code section 915.10A,
 16 34 information concerning a juvenile charged with a felony offense
 16 35 may be released pursuant to an automated victim notification
 17  1 system. Under the bill, these exemptions to confidentiality
 17  2 are not amended and therefore still apply to juvenile court
 17  3 records.
 17  4    RIGHT TO COUNSEL.  The bill in Code section 232.11 provides
 17  5 that a child has the right to be represented by counsel at a
 17  6 hearing on a confidentiality order under Code section 232.149A
 17  7 or a public records order under Code section 232.149B.

 13 33    CONFIDENTIALITY OF RECORDS AND FILES OF CRIMINAL OR
 13 34 JUVENILE JUSTICE AGENCIES.  Under current law, records and
 13 35 files of a criminal or juvenile justice agency concerning
 14  1 a child involved in a delinquent act are public records,
 14  2 subject to certain exceptions. The bill in Code section
 14  3 232.149 provides that the records and files of a criminal or
 14  4 juvenile justice agency, an intake officer, or a juvenile court
 14  5 officer concerning a child involved in a delinquent act are
 14  6 confidential. The bill further provides that the records of an
 14  7 intake officer or juvenile court officer containing a dismissal
 14  8 of a complaint or an informal adjustment of a complaint when
 14  9 no petition is filed relating to the complaint, shall not be
 14 10 available to the public, but may be disclosed to the judge and
 14 11 professional court staff, including juvenile court officers;
 14 12 the child's counsel or guardian ad litem; the county attorney
 14 13 and county attorney's assistants;  the superintendent or the
 14 14 superintendent's designee of the school district for the

 14 19 law; the statistical analysis center for the purposes stated
 14 20 in Code section 216A.136; the state public defender;  the
 14 21 department of human services; and the alleged victim of the
 14 22 delinquent act.
 14 23    PUBLIC RECORDS HEARINGS.  The bill enacts new Code section
 14 24 232.149B, which provides that a person may apply for a court
 14 25 order to make confidential juvenile court records public.
 14 26 The bill provides that a rebuttable presumption exists that
 14 27 official juvenile court records shall remain confidential. The
 14 28 bill provides that the court shall order the official juvenile
 14 29 court records in such a delinquency proceeding to be public
 14 30 records if either the public's interest in making the records
 14 31 public outweighs the juvenile's interest in maintaining the
 14 32 confidentiality of the records or the juvenile has been placed
 14 33 on youthful offender status pursuant to Code section 232.45(7)
 14 34 and Code section 907.3A(1), and will be transferred back to
 14 35 the district court for sentencing prior to the child's 18th
 15  1 birthday. The court may order the official juvenile court
 15  2 records in such a delinquency proceeding to be public records
 15  3 if the juvenile has been subsequently adjudicated delinquent
 15  4 for a public offense that would be a serious misdemeanor,
 15  5 aggravated misdemeanor, or felony offense if committed by an
 15  6 adult, or another delinquency proceeding is pending seeking
 15  7 such an adjudication. The bill provides that records subject
 15  8 to a public records order may be sealed at a later date
 15  9 pursuant to Code section 232.150.
 15 10    RIGHT TO REVIEW AND RELEASE A CONFIDENTIAL COMPLAINT.  The
 15 11 bill provides that delinquency complaints shall be released
 15 12 in accordance with Code section 915.25. Under current Code
 15 13 section 915.25, a complaint which alleges that a child who is
 15 14 at least 10 years of age committed a delinquent act, which if
 15 15 committed by an adult would be a public offense, is a public
 15 16 record. Current Code section 915.25 authorizes the court,
 15 17 its designee, or law enforcement officials to release such
 15 18 a complaint, including the identity of the child. The bill
 15 19 amends Code section 915.25 to provide that such a complaint
 15 20 is confidential unless the complaint alleges that the child
 15 21 committed a delinquent act that if committed by an adult would
 15 22 be a forcible felony. However, the bill authorizes state and
 15 23 local enforcement officials to release a confidential complaint
 15 24 against a child if the child is at large and doing so is deemed
 15 25 necessary for the protection of the public or the safety of
 15 26 the child. If the complaint is not confidential because the
 15 27 alleged delinquent act is an act that would be a forcible
 15 28 felony if committed by an adult, the court, its designee,
 15 29 or law enforcement officials may release such a complaint,
 15 30 including the identity of the child.
 15 31    The bill provides that an intake or juvenile court officer
 15 32 shall disclose to the alleged victim of a delinquent act, upon
 15 33 request, the complaint, the name and address of the child who
 15 34 allegedly committed the delinquent act, and the disposition
 15 35 of the complaint. If the alleged delinquent act would be
 16  1 a forcible felony if committed by an adult, the intake or
 16  2 juvenile court officer shall provide notification to the victim
 16  3 as required by Code section 915.24.
 16  4    SEALING OF JUVENILE COURT RECORDS UNAVAILABLE FOR
 16  5 OPERATING=WHILE=INTOXICATED VIOLATIONS.  Under current Code
 16  6 section 232.150, a court shall order juvenile court records
 16  7 to be sealed if the person who is the subject of the juvenile
 16  8 court records is 18 years of age or older and 2 years have
 16  9 elapsed since the last official action in the person's case,
 16 10 the person has not been subsequently convicted of a felony
 16 11 or an aggravated or serious misdemeanor or adjudicated a
 16 12 delinquent child for an act which if committed by an adult
 16 13 would be a felony, an aggravated misdemeanor, or a serious
 16 14 misdemeanor and no proceeding is pending seeking such
 16 15 conviction or adjudication, and the person was not placed on
 16 16 youthful offender status, transferred back to district court
 16 17 after the youthful offender's 18th birthday, and sentenced for
 16 18 the offense which precipitated the youthful offender placement.
 16 19 The bill in newly designated Code section 232.150(4) provides
 16 20 that the court shall not seal a person's juvenile court records
 16 21 if the person was adjudicated delinquent for violating Code
 16 22 section 321J.2, which prohibits the operation of a motor
 16 23 vehicle while under the influence of alcohol or a drug.
 16 24    RELEASE OF CONFIDENTIAL RECORDS.  The bill provides that a
 16 25 public record which is confidential under the provisions of
 16 26 Code chapter 232 shall only be subject to release upon order of
 16 27 a court in a proceeding under Code chapter 232.
 16 28    EXISTING CONFIDENTIALITY EXEMPTIONS.  The bill retains
 16 29 certain existing exemptions to confidentiality of juvenile
 16 30 court records. Pursuant to Code section 692A.121(8), records
 16 31 concerning sex offense convictions which are committed by
 16 32 minors may be released in the same manner as records of
 16 33 convictions of adults. Pursuant to Code section 915.10A,
 16 34 information concerning a juvenile charged with a felony offense
 16 35 may be released pursuant to an automated victim notification

 17  2 are not amended and therefore still apply to juvenile court
 17  3 records.

 17  7 or a public records order under Code section 232.149B.

 13 33    CONFIDENTIALITY OF RECORDS AND FILES OF CRIMINAL OR
 13 34 JUVENILE JUSTICE AGENCIES.  Under current law, records and
 13 35 files of a criminal or juvenile justice agency concerning
 14  1 a child involved in a delinquent act are public records,
 14  2 subject to certain exceptions. The bill in Code section
 14  3 232.149 provides that the records and files of a criminal or
 14  4 juvenile justice agency, an intake officer, or a juvenile court
 14  5 officer concerning a child involved in a delinquent act are
 14  6 confidential. The bill further provides that the records of an
 14  7 intake officer or juvenile court officer containing a dismissal
 14  8 of a complaint or an informal adjustment of a complaint when
 14  9 no petition is filed relating to the complaint, shall not be
 14 10 available to the public, but may be disclosed to the judge and
 14 11 professional court staff, including juvenile court officers;
 14 12 the child's counsel or guardian ad litem; the county attorney
 14 13 and county attorney's assistants;  the superintendent or the

 14 20 in Code section 216A.136; the state public defender;  the
 14 21 department of human services; and the alleged victim of the
 14 22 delinquent act.
 14 23    PUBLIC RECORDS HEARINGS.  The bill enacts new Code section
 14 24 232.149B, which provides that a person may apply for a court
 14 25 order to make confidential juvenile court records public.
 14 26 The bill provides that a rebuttable presumption exists that
 14 27 official juvenile court records shall remain confidential. The
 14 28 bill provides that the court shall order the official juvenile
 14 29 court records in such a delinquency proceeding to be public
 14 30 records if either the public's interest in making the records
 14 31 public outweighs the juvenile's interest in maintaining the
 14 32 confidentiality of the records or the juvenile has been placed
 14 33 on youthful offender status pursuant to Code section 232.45(7)
 14 34 and Code section 907.3A(1), and will be transferred back to
 14 35 the district court for sentencing prior to the child's 18th
 15  1 birthday. The court may order the official juvenile court
 15  2 records in such a delinquency proceeding to be public records
 15  3 if the juvenile has been subsequently adjudicated delinquent
 15  4 for a public offense that would be a serious misdemeanor,
 15  5 aggravated misdemeanor, or felony offense if committed by an
 15  6 adult, or another delinquency proceeding is pending seeking
 15  7 such an adjudication. The bill provides that records subject
 15  8 to a public records order may be sealed at a later date
 15  9 pursuant to Code section 232.150.
 15 10    RIGHT TO REVIEW AND RELEASE A CONFIDENTIAL COMPLAINT.  The
 15 11 bill provides that delinquency complaints shall be released
 15 12 in accordance with Code section 915.25. Under current Code
 15 13 section 915.25, a complaint which alleges that a child who is
 15 14 at least 10 years of age committed a delinquent act, which if
 15 15 committed by an adult would be a public offense, is a public
 15 16 record. Current Code section 915.25 authorizes the court,
 15 17 its designee, or law enforcement officials to release such
 15 18 a complaint, including the identity of the child. The bill
 15 19 amends Code section 915.25 to provide that such a complaint
 15 20 is confidential unless the complaint alleges that the child
 15 21 committed a delinquent act that if committed by an adult would
 15 22 be a forcible felony. However, the bill authorizes state and
 15 23 local enforcement officials to release a confidential complaint
 15 24 against a child if the child is at large and doing so is deemed
 15 25 necessary for the protection of the public or the safety of
 15 26 the child. If the complaint is not confidential because the
 15 27 alleged delinquent act is an act that would be a forcible
 15 28 felony if committed by an adult, the court, its designee,
 15 29 or law enforcement officials may release such a complaint,
 15 30 including the identity of the child.
 15 31    The bill provides that an intake or juvenile court officer
 15 32 shall disclose to the alleged victim of a delinquent act, upon
 15 33 request, the complaint, the name and address of the child who
 15 34 allegedly committed the delinquent act, and the disposition
 15 35 of the complaint. If the alleged delinquent act would be
 16  1 a forcible felony if committed by an adult, the intake or
 16  2 juvenile court officer shall provide notification to the victim
 16  3 as required by Code section 915.24.
 16  4    SEALING OF JUVENILE COURT RECORDS UNAVAILABLE FOR
 16  5 OPERATING=WHILE=INTOXICATED VIOLATIONS.  Under current Code
 16  6 section 232.150, a court shall order juvenile court records
 16  7 to be sealed if the person who is the subject of the juvenile
 16  8 court records is 18 years of age or older and 2 years have
 16  9 elapsed since the last official action in the person's case,
 16 10 the person has not been subsequently convicted of a felony
 16 11 or an aggravated or serious misdemeanor or adjudicated a
 16 12 delinquent child for an act which if committed by an adult
 16 13 would be a felony, an aggravated misdemeanor, or a serious
 16 14 misdemeanor and no proceeding is pending seeking such
 16 15 conviction or adjudication, and the person was not placed on
 16 16 youthful offender status, transferred back to district court
 16 17 after the youthful offender's 18th birthday, and sentenced for
 16 18 the offense which precipitated the youthful offender placement.
 16 19 The bill in newly designated Code section 232.150(4) provides
 16 20 that the court shall not seal a person's juvenile court records
 16 21 if the person was adjudicated delinquent for violating Code
 16 22 section 321J.2, which prohibits the operation of a motor
 16 23 vehicle while under the influence of alcohol or a drug.
 16 24    RELEASE OF CONFIDENTIAL RECORDS.  The bill provides that a
 16 25 public record which is confidential under the provisions of
 16 26 Code chapter 232 shall only be subject to release upon order of
 16 27 a court in a proceeding under Code chapter 232.
 16 28    EXISTING CONFIDENTIALITY EXEMPTIONS.  The bill retains
 16 29 certain existing exemptions to confidentiality of juvenile
 16 30 court records. Pursuant to Code section 692A.121(8), records
 16 31 concerning sex offense convictions which are committed by
 16 32 minors may be released in the same manner as records of
 16 33 convictions of adults. Pursuant to Code section 915.10A,
 16 34 information concerning a juvenile charged with a felony offense
 16 35 may be released pursuant to an automated victim notification
 17  1 system. Under the bill, these exemptions to confidentiality
 17  2 are not amended and therefore still apply to juvenile court
 17  3 records.
 17  4    RIGHT TO COUNSEL.  The bill in Code section 232.11 provides
 17  5 that a child has the right to be represented by counsel at a
 17  6 hearing on a confidentiality order under Code section 232.149A
 17  7 or a public records order under Code section 232.149B.
 17  8    APPLICABILITY.  The bill applies to juvenile delinquency
 17  9 proceedings which are pending or arise on or after July 1,
 17 10 2016.

 13 34 JUVENILE JUSTICE AGENCIES.  Under current law, records and
 13 35 files of a criminal or juvenile justice agency concerning
 14  1 a child involved in a delinquent act are public records,
 14  2 subject to certain exceptions. The bill in Code section
 14  3 232.149 provides that the records and files of a criminal or
 14  4 juvenile justice agency, an intake officer, or a juvenile court
 14  5 officer concerning a child involved in a delinquent act are
 14  6 confidential. The bill further provides that the records of an
 14  7 intake officer or juvenile court officer containing a dismissal
 14  8 of a complaint or an informal adjustment of a complaint when
 14  9 no petition is filed relating to the complaint, shall not be
 14 10 available to the public, but may be disclosed to the judge and
 14 11 professional court staff, including juvenile court officers;
 14 12 the child's counsel or guardian ad litem; the county attorney
 14 13 and county attorney's assistants;  the superintendent or the
 14 14 superintendent's designee of the school district for the
 14 15 school attended by the child or the authorities in charge of
 14 16 an accredited nonpublic school attended by the child; a member
 14 17 of the armed forces of the United States who is conducting a
 14 18 background investigation of an individual pursuant to federal
 14 19 law; the statistical analysis center for the purposes stated
 14 20 in Code section 216A.136; the state public defender;  the
 14 21 department of human services; and the alleged victim of the
 14 22 delinquent act.
 14 23    PUBLIC RECORDS HEARINGS.  The bill enacts new Code section
 14 24 232.149B, which provides that a person may apply for a court
 14 25 order to make confidential juvenile court records public.
 14 26 The bill provides that a rebuttable presumption exists that
 14 27 official juvenile court records shall remain confidential. The
 14 28 bill provides that the court shall order the official juvenile
 14 29 court records in such a delinquency proceeding to be public
 14 30 records if either the public's interest in making the records
 14 31 public outweighs the juvenile's interest in maintaining the
 14 32 confidentiality of the records or the juvenile has been placed
 14 33 on youthful offender status pursuant to Code section 232.45(7)
 14 34 and Code section 907.3A(1), and will be transferred back to
 14 35 the district court for sentencing prior to the child's 18th
 15  1 birthday. The court may order the official juvenile court
 15  2 records in such a delinquency proceeding to be public records
 15  3 if the juvenile has been subsequently adjudicated delinquent
 15  4 for a public offense that would be a serious misdemeanor,
 15  5 aggravated misdemeanor, or felony offense if committed by an
 15  6 adult, or another delinquency proceeding is pending seeking
 15  7 such an adjudication. The bill provides that records subject
 15  8 to a public records order may be sealed at a later date
 15  9 pursuant to Code section 232.150.
 15 10    RIGHT TO REVIEW AND RELEASE A CONFIDENTIAL COMPLAINT.  The
 15 11 bill provides that delinquency complaints shall be released
 15 12 in accordance with Code section 915.25. Under current Code
 15 13 section 915.25, a complaint which alleges that a child who is
 15 14 at least 10 years of age committed a delinquent act, which if
 15 15 committed by an adult would be a public offense, is a public
 15 16 record. Current Code section 915.25 authorizes the court,
 15 17 its designee, or law enforcement officials to release such
 15 18 a complaint, including the identity of the child. The bill
 15 19 amends Code section 915.25 to provide that such a complaint
 15 20 is confidential unless the complaint alleges that the child
 15 21 committed a delinquent act that if committed by an adult would
 15 22 be a forcible felony. However, the bill authorizes state and
 15 23 local enforcement officials to release a confidential complaint
 15 24 against a child if the child is at large and doing so is deemed
 15 25 necessary for the protection of the public or the safety of
 15 26 the child. If the complaint is not confidential because the
 15 27 alleged delinquent act is an act that would be a forcible
 15 28 felony if committed by an adult, the court, its designee,
 15 29 or law enforcement officials may release such a complaint,
 15 30 including the identity of the child.
 15 31    The bill provides that an intake or juvenile court officer
 15 32 shall disclose to the alleged victim of a delinquent act, upon
 15 33 request, the complaint, the name and address of the child who
 15 34 allegedly committed the delinquent act, and the disposition
 15 35 of the complaint. If the alleged delinquent act would be
 16  1 a forcible felony if committed by an adult, the intake or
 16  2 juvenile court officer shall provide notification to the victim
 16  3 as required by Code section 915.24.
 16  4    SEALING OF JUVENILE COURT RECORDS UNAVAILABLE FOR
 16  5 OPERATING=WHILE=INTOXICATED VIOLATIONS.  Under current Code
 16  6 section 232.150, a court shall order juvenile court records
 16  7 to be sealed if the person who is the subject of the juvenile
 16  8 court records is 18 years of age or older and 2 years have
 16  9 elapsed since the last official action in the person's case,
 16 10 the person has not been subsequently convicted of a felony
 16 11 or an aggravated or serious misdemeanor or adjudicated a
 16 12 delinquent child for an act which if committed by an adult
 16 13 would be a felony, an aggravated misdemeanor, or a serious
 16 14 misdemeanor and no proceeding is pending seeking such
 16 15 conviction or adjudication, and the person was not placed on
 16 16 youthful offender status, transferred back to district court
 16 17 after the youthful offender's 18th birthday, and sentenced for
 16 18 the offense which precipitated the youthful offender placement.
 16 19 The bill in newly designated Code section 232.150(4) provides
 16 20 that the court shall not seal a person's juvenile court records
 16 21 if the person was adjudicated delinquent for violating Code
 16 22 section 321J.2, which prohibits the operation of a motor
 16 23 vehicle while under the influence of alcohol or a drug.
 16 24    RELEASE OF CONFIDENTIAL RECORDS.  The bill provides that a
 16 25 public record which is confidential under the provisions of
 16 26 Code chapter 232 shall only be subject to release upon order of
 16 27 a court in a proceeding under Code chapter 232.
 16 28    EXISTING CONFIDENTIALITY EXEMPTIONS.  The bill retains
 16 29 certain existing exemptions to confidentiality of juvenile
 16 30 court records. Pursuant to Code section 692A.121(8), records
 16 31 concerning sex offense convictions which are committed by
 16 32 minors may be released in the same manner as records of
 16 33 convictions of adults. Pursuant to Code section 915.10A,
 16 34 information concerning a juvenile charged with a felony offense
 16 35 may be released pursuant to an automated victim notification
 17  1 system. Under the bill, these exemptions to confidentiality
 17  2 are not amended and therefore still apply to juvenile court
 17  3 records.
 17  4    RIGHT TO COUNSEL.  The bill in Code section 232.11 provides
 17  5 that a child has the right to be represented by counsel at a
 17  6 hearing on a confidentiality order under Code section 232.149A
 17  7 or a public records order under Code section 232.149B.
 17  8    APPLICABILITY.  The bill applies to juvenile delinquency
 17  9 proceedings which are pending or arise on or after July 1,
 17 10 2016.

 13 35 files of a criminal or juvenile justice agency concerning
 14  1 a child involved in a delinquent act are public records,
 14  2 subject to certain exceptions. The bill in Code section
 14  3 232.149 provides that the records and files of a criminal or
 14  4 juvenile justice agency, an intake officer, or a juvenile court
 14  5 officer concerning a child involved in a delinquent act are
 14  6 confidential. The bill further provides that the records of an
 14  7 intake officer or juvenile court officer containing a dismissal
 14  8 of a complaint or an informal adjustment of a complaint when
 14  9 no petition is filed relating to the complaint, shall not be
 14 10 available to the public, but may be disclosed to the judge and
 14 11 professional court staff, including juvenile court officers;
 14 12 the child's counsel or guardian ad litem; the county attorney
 14 13 and county attorney's assistants;  the superintendent or the
 14 14 superintendent's designee of the school district for the
 14 15 school attended by the child or the authorities in charge of
 14 16 an accredited nonpublic school attended by the child; a member
 14 17 of the armed forces of the United States who is conducting a

 14 19 law; the statistical analysis center for the purposes stated
 14 20 in Code section 216A.136; the state public defender;  the
 14 21 department of human services; and the alleged victim of the
 14 22 delinquent act.
 14 23    PUBLIC RECORDS HEARINGS.  The bill enacts new Code section
 14 24 232.149B, which provides that a person may apply for a court
 14 25 order to make confidential juvenile court records public.
 14 26 The bill provides that a rebuttable presumption exists that
 14 27 official juvenile court records shall remain confidential. The
 14 28 bill provides that the court shall order the official juvenile
 14 29 court records in such a delinquency proceeding to be public
 14 30 records if either the public's interest in making the records
 14 31 public outweighs the juvenile's interest in maintaining the
 14 32 confidentiality of the records or the juvenile has been placed
 14 33 on youthful offender status pursuant to Code section 232.45(7)
 14 34 and Code section 907.3A(1), and will be transferred back to
 14 35 the district court for sentencing prior to the child's 18th
 15  1 birthday. The court may order the official juvenile court
 15  2 records in such a delinquency proceeding to be public records
 15  3 if the juvenile has been subsequently adjudicated delinquent
 15  4 for a public offense that would be a serious misdemeanor,
 15  5 aggravated misdemeanor, or felony offense if committed by an
 15  6 adult, or another delinquency proceeding is pending seeking
 15  7 such an adjudication. The bill provides that records subject
 15  8 to a public records order may be sealed at a later date
 15  9 pursuant to Code section 232.150.
 15 10    RIGHT TO REVIEW AND RELEASE A CONFIDENTIAL COMPLAINT.  The
 15 11 bill provides that delinquency complaints shall be released
 15 12 in accordance with Code section 915.25. Under current Code
 15 13 section 915.25, a complaint which alleges that a child who is
 15 14 at least 10 years of age committed a delinquent act, which if
 15 15 committed by an adult would be a public offense, is a public
 15 16 record. Current Code section 915.25 authorizes the court,
 15 17 its designee, or law enforcement officials to release such
 15 18 a complaint, including the identity of the child. The bill
 15 19 amends Code section 915.25 to provide that such a complaint
 15 20 is confidential unless the complaint alleges that the child
 15 21 committed a delinquent act that if committed by an adult would
 15 22 be a forcible felony. However, the bill authorizes state and
 15 23 local enforcement officials to release a confidential complaint
 15 24 against a child if the child is at large and doing so is deemed
 15 25 necessary for the protection of the public or the safety of
 15 26 the child. If the complaint is not confidential because the
 15 27 alleged delinquent act is an act that would be a forcible
 15 28 felony if committed by an adult, the court, its designee,
 15 29 or law enforcement officials may release such a complaint,
 15 30 including the identity of the child.
 15 31    The bill provides that an intake or juvenile court officer
 15 32 shall disclose to the alleged victim of a delinquent act, upon
 15 33 request, the complaint, the name and address of the child who
 15 34 allegedly committed the delinquent act, and the disposition
 15 35 of the complaint. If the alleged delinquent act would be
 16  1 a forcible felony if committed by an adult, the intake or
 16  2 juvenile court officer shall provide notification to the victim
 16  3 as required by Code section 915.24.
 16  4    SEALING OF JUVENILE COURT RECORDS UNAVAILABLE FOR
 16  5 OPERATING=WHILE=INTOXICATED VIOLATIONS.  Under current Code
 16  6 section 232.150, a court shall order juvenile court records
 16  7 to be sealed if the person who is the subject of the juvenile
 16  8 court records is 18 years of age or older and 2 years have
 16  9 elapsed since the last official action in the person's case,
 16 10 the person has not been subsequently convicted of a felony
 16 11 or an aggravated or serious misdemeanor or adjudicated a
 16 12 delinquent child for an act which if committed by an adult
 16 13 would be a felony, an aggravated misdemeanor, or a serious
 16 14 misdemeanor and no proceeding is pending seeking such
 16 15 conviction or adjudication, and the person was not placed on
 16 16 youthful offender status, transferred back to district court
 16 17 after the youthful offender's 18th birthday, and sentenced for
 16 18 the offense which precipitated the youthful offender placement.
 16 19 The bill in newly designated Code section 232.150(4) provides
 16 20 that the court shall not seal a person's juvenile court records
 16 21 if the person was adjudicated delinquent for violating Code
 16 22 section 321J.2, which prohibits the operation of a motor
 16 23 vehicle while under the influence of alcohol or a drug.
 16 24    RELEASE OF CONFIDENTIAL RECORDS.  The bill provides that a
 16 25 public record which is confidential under the provisions of
 16 26 Code chapter 232 shall only be subject to release upon order of
 16 27 a court in a proceeding under Code chapter 232.
 16 28    EXISTING CONFIDENTIALITY EXEMPTIONS.  The bill retains
 16 29 certain existing exemptions to confidentiality of juvenile
 16 30 court records. Pursuant to Code section 692A.121(8), records
 16 31 concerning sex offense convictions which are committed by
 16 32 minors may be released in the same manner as records of
 16 33 convictions of adults. Pursuant to Code section 915.10A,
 16 34 information concerning a juvenile charged with a felony offense
 16 35 may be released pursuant to an automated victim notification
 17  1 system. Under the bill, these exemptions to confidentiality
 17  2 are not amended and therefore still apply to juvenile court
 17  3 records.

 14  1 a child involved in a delinquent act are public records,
 14  2 subject to certain exceptions. The bill in Code section
 14  3 232.149 provides that the records and files of a criminal or
 14  4 juvenile justice agency, an intake officer, or a juvenile court
 14  5 officer concerning a child involved in a delinquent act are
 14  6 confidential. The bill further provides that the records of an

 14  8 of a complaint or an informal adjustment of a complaint when
 14  9 no petition is filed relating to the complaint, shall not be
 14 10 available to the public, but may be disclosed to the judge and

 14 13 and county attorney's assistants;  the superintendent or the

 14 22 delinquent act.
 14 23    PUBLIC RECORDS HEARINGS.  The bill enacts new Code section
 14 24 232.149B, which provides that a person may apply for a court
 14 25 order to make confidential juvenile court records public.
 14 26 The bill provides that a rebuttable presumption exists that
 14 27 official juvenile court records shall remain confidential. The
 14 28 bill provides that the court shall order the official juvenile
 14 29 court records in such a delinquency proceeding to be public
 14 30 records if either the public's interest in making the records
 14 31 public outweighs the juvenile's interest in maintaining the
 14 32 confidentiality of the records or the juvenile has been placed
 14 33 on youthful offender status pursuant to Code section 232.45(7)
 14 34 and Code section 907.3A(1), and will be transferred back to
 14 35 the district court for sentencing prior to the child's 18th
 15  1 birthday. The court may order the official juvenile court
 15  2 records in such a delinquency proceeding to be public records
 15  3 if the juvenile has been subsequently adjudicated delinquent
 15  4 for a public offense that would be a serious misdemeanor,
 15  5 aggravated misdemeanor, or felony offense if committed by an
 15  6 adult, or another delinquency proceeding is pending seeking
 15  7 such an adjudication. The bill provides that records subject
 15  8 to a public records order may be sealed at a later date
 15  9 pursuant to Code section 232.150.
 15 10    RIGHT TO REVIEW AND RELEASE A CONFIDENTIAL COMPLAINT.  The
 15 11 bill provides that delinquency complaints shall be released
 15 12 in accordance with Code section 915.25. Under current Code
 15 13 section 915.25, a complaint which alleges that a child who is
 15 14 at least 10 years of age committed a delinquent act, which if
 15 15 committed by an adult would be a public offense, is a public
 15 16 record. Current Code section 915.25 authorizes the court,
 15 17 its designee, or law enforcement officials to release such
 15 18 a complaint, including the identity of the child. The bill
 15 19 amends Code section 915.25 to provide that such a complaint
 15 20 is confidential unless the complaint alleges that the child
 15 21 committed a delinquent act that if committed by an adult would
 15 22 be a forcible felony. However, the bill authorizes state and
 15 23 local enforcement officials to release a confidential complaint
 15 24 against a child if the child is at large and doing so is deemed
 15 25 necessary for the protection of the public or the safety of
 15 26 the child. If the complaint is not confidential because the
 15 27 alleged delinquent act is an act that would be a forcible
 15 28 felony if committed by an adult, the court, its designee,
 15 29 or law enforcement officials may release such a complaint,
 15 30 including the identity of the child.
 15 31    The bill provides that an intake or juvenile court officer
 15 32 shall disclose to the alleged victim of a delinquent act, upon
 15 33 request, the complaint, the name and address of the child who
 15 34 allegedly committed the delinquent act, and the disposition
 15 35 of the complaint. If the alleged delinquent act would be
 16  1 a forcible felony if committed by an adult, the intake or
 16  2 juvenile court officer shall provide notification to the victim
 16  3 as required by Code section 915.24.
 16  4    SEALING OF JUVENILE COURT RECORDS UNAVAILABLE FOR
 16  5 OPERATING=WHILE=INTOXICATED VIOLATIONS.  Under current Code
 16  6 section 232.150, a court shall order juvenile court records
 16  7 to be sealed if the person who is the subject of the juvenile
 16  8 court records is 18 years of age or older and 2 years have
 16  9 elapsed since the last official action in the person's case,
 16 10 the person has not been subsequently convicted of a felony
 16 11 or an aggravated or serious misdemeanor or adjudicated a
 16 12 delinquent child for an act which if committed by an adult
 16 13 would be a felony, an aggravated misdemeanor, or a serious
 16 14 misdemeanor and no proceeding is pending seeking such
 16 15 conviction or adjudication, and the person was not placed on
 16 16 youthful offender status, transferred back to district court
 16 17 after the youthful offender's 18th birthday, and sentenced for
 16 18 the offense which precipitated the youthful offender placement.
 16 19 The bill in newly designated Code section 232.150(4) provides
 16 20 that the court shall not seal a person's juvenile court records
 16 21 if the person was adjudicated delinquent for violating Code
 16 22 section 321J.2, which prohibits the operation of a motor
 16 23 vehicle while under the influence of alcohol or a drug.

 14 14 superintendent's designee of the school district for the
 14 15 school attended by the child or the authorities in charge of
 14 16 an accredited nonpublic school attended by the child; a member
 14 17 of the armed forces of the United States who is conducting a
 14 18 background investigation of an individual pursuant to federal
 14 19 law; the statistical analysis center for the purposes stated
 14 20 in Code section 216A.136; the state public defender;  the
 14 21 department of human services; and the alleged victim of the
 14 22 delinquent act.
 14 23    PUBLIC RECORDS HEARINGS.  The bill enacts new Code section
 14 24 232.149B, which provides that a person may apply for a court
 14 25 order to make confidential juvenile court records public.
 14 26 The bill provides that a rebuttable presumption exists that
 14 27 official juvenile court records shall remain confidential. The
 14 28 bill provides that the court shall order the official juvenile
 14 29 court records in such a delinquency proceeding to be public
 14 30 records if either the public's interest in making the records
 14 31 public outweighs the juvenile's interest in maintaining the
 14 32 confidentiality of the records or the juvenile has been placed
 14 33 on youthful offender status pursuant to Code section 232.45(7)
 14 34 and Code section 907.3A(1), and will be transferred back to
 14 35 the district court for sentencing prior to the child's 18th
 15  1 birthday. The court may order the official juvenile court
 15  2 records in such a delinquency proceeding to be public records
 15  3 if the juvenile has been subsequently adjudicated delinquent
 15  4 for a public offense that would be a serious misdemeanor,
 15  5 aggravated misdemeanor, or felony offense if committed by an
 15  6 adult, or another delinquency proceeding is pending seeking
 15  7 such an adjudication. The bill provides that records subject
 15  8 to a public records order may be sealed at a later date
 15  9 pursuant to Code section 232.150.
 15 10    RIGHT TO REVIEW AND RELEASE A CONFIDENTIAL COMPLAINT.  The
 15 11 bill provides that delinquency complaints shall be released
 15 12 in accordance with Code section 915.25. Under current Code
 15 13 section 915.25, a complaint which alleges that a child who is
 15 14 at least 10 years of age committed a delinquent act, which if
 15 15 committed by an adult would be a public offense, is a public
 15 16 record. Current Code section 915.25 authorizes the court,
 15 17 its designee, or law enforcement officials to release such
 15 18 a complaint, including the identity of the child. The bill
 15 19 amends Code section 915.25 to provide that such a complaint
 15 20 is confidential unless the complaint alleges that the child
 15 21 committed a delinquent act that if committed by an adult would
 15 22 be a forcible felony. However, the bill authorizes state and
 15 23 local enforcement officials to release a confidential complaint
 15 24 against a child if the child is at large and doing so is deemed
 15 25 necessary for the protection of the public or the safety of
 15 26 the child. If the complaint is not confidential because the
 15 27 alleged delinquent act is an act that would be a forcible
 15 28 felony if committed by an adult, the court, its designee,
 15 29 or law enforcement officials may release such a complaint,
 15 30 including the identity of the child.
 15 31    The bill provides that an intake or juvenile court officer
 15 32 shall disclose to the alleged victim of a delinquent act, upon
 15 33 request, the complaint, the name and address of the child who
 15 34 allegedly committed the delinquent act, and the disposition
 15 35 of the complaint. If the alleged delinquent act would be
 16  1 a forcible felony if committed by an adult, the intake or
 16  2 juvenile court officer shall provide notification to the victim
 16  3 as required by Code section 915.24.
 16  4    SEALING OF JUVENILE COURT RECORDS UNAVAILABLE FOR
 16  5 OPERATING=WHILE=INTOXICATED VIOLATIONS.  Under current Code
 16  6 section 232.150, a court shall order juvenile court records
 16  7 to be sealed if the person who is the subject of the juvenile
 16  8 court records is 18 years of age or older and 2 years have
 16  9 elapsed since the last official action in the person's case,
 16 10 the person has not been subsequently convicted of a felony
 16 11 or an aggravated or serious misdemeanor or adjudicated a
 16 12 delinquent child for an act which if committed by an adult
 16 13 would be a felony, an aggravated misdemeanor, or a serious
 16 14 misdemeanor and no proceeding is pending seeking such
 16 15 conviction or adjudication, and the person was not placed on
 16 16 youthful offender status, transferred back to district court
 16 17 after the youthful offender's 18th birthday, and sentenced for
 16 18 the offense which precipitated the youthful offender placement.
 16 19 The bill in newly designated Code section 232.150(4) provides
 16 20 that the court shall not seal a person's juvenile court records
 16 21 if the person was adjudicated delinquent for violating Code
 16 22 section 321J.2, which prohibits the operation of a motor
 16 23 vehicle while under the influence of alcohol or a drug.
 16 24    RELEASE OF CONFIDENTIAL RECORDS.  The bill provides that a
 16 25 public record which is confidential under the provisions of
 16 26 Code chapter 232 shall only be subject to release upon order of
 16 27 a court in a proceeding under Code chapter 232.
 16 28    EXISTING CONFIDENTIALITY EXEMPTIONS.  The bill retains
 16 29 certain existing exemptions to confidentiality of juvenile
 16 30 court records. Pursuant to Code section 692A.121(8), records
 16 31 concerning sex offense convictions which are committed by
 16 32 minors may be released in the same manner as records of
 16 33 convictions of adults. Pursuant to Code section 915.10A,
 16 34 information concerning a juvenile charged with a felony offense
 16 35 may be released pursuant to an automated victim notification
 17  1 system. Under the bill, these exemptions to confidentiality
 17  2 are not amended and therefore still apply to juvenile court
 17  3 records.
 17  4    RIGHT TO COUNSEL.  The bill in Code section 232.11 provides
 17  5 that a child has the right to be represented by counsel at a
 17  6 hearing on a confidentiality order under Code section 232.149A
 17  7 or a public records order under Code section 232.149B.
 17  8    APPLICABILITY.  The bill applies to juvenile delinquency
 17  9 proceedings which are pending or arise on or after July 1,
 17 10 2016.

 14  3 232.149 provides that the records and files of a criminal or
 14  4 juvenile justice agency, an intake officer, or a juvenile court
 14  5 officer concerning a child involved in a delinquent act are
 14  6 confidential. The bill further provides that the records of an
 14  7 intake officer or juvenile court officer containing a dismissal
 14  8 of a complaint or an informal adjustment of a complaint when
 14  9 no petition is filed relating to the complaint, shall not be
 14 10 available to the public, but may be disclosed to the judge and
 14 11 professional court staff, including juvenile court officers;
 14 12 the child's counsel or guardian ad litem; the county attorney
 14 13 and county attorney's assistants;  the superintendent or the
 14 14 superintendent's designee of the school district for the
 14 15 school attended by the child or the authorities in charge of
 14 16 an accredited nonpublic school attended by the child; a member
 14 17 of the armed forces of the United States who is conducting a
 14 18 background investigation of an individual pursuant to federal
 14 19 law; the statistical analysis center for the purposes stated
 14 20 in Code section 216A.136; the state public defender;  the
 14 21 department of human services; and the alleged victim of the
 14 22 delinquent act.
 14 23    PUBLIC RECORDS HEARINGS.  The bill enacts new Code section
 14 24 232.149B, which provides that a person may apply for a court
 14 25 order to make confidential juvenile court records public.
 14 26 The bill provides that a rebuttable presumption exists that
 14 27 official juvenile court records shall remain confidential. The
 14 28 bill provides that the court shall order the official juvenile
 14 29 court records in such a delinquency proceeding to be public
 14 30 records if either the public's interest in making the records
 14 31 public outweighs the juvenile's interest in maintaining the
 14 32 confidentiality of the records or the juvenile has been placed
 14 33 on youthful offender status pursuant to Code section 232.45(7)
 14 34 and Code section 907.3A(1), and will be transferred back to
 14 35 the district court for sentencing prior to the child's 18th
 15  1 birthday. The court may order the official juvenile court
 15  2 records in such a delinquency proceeding to be public records
 15  3 if the juvenile has been subsequently adjudicated delinquent
 15  4 for a public offense that would be a serious misdemeanor,
 15  5 aggravated misdemeanor, or felony offense if committed by an
 15  6 adult, or another delinquency proceeding is pending seeking
 15  7 such an adjudication. The bill provides that records subject
 15  8 to a public records order may be sealed at a later date
 15  9 pursuant to Code section 232.150.
 15 10    RIGHT TO REVIEW AND RELEASE A CONFIDENTIAL COMPLAINT.  The
 15 11 bill provides that delinquency complaints shall be released
 15 12 in accordance with Code section 915.25. Under current Code
 15 13 section 915.25, a complaint which alleges that a child who is
 15 14 at least 10 years of age committed a delinquent act, which if
 15 15 committed by an adult would be a public offense, is a public
 15 16 record. Current Code section 915.25 authorizes the court,
 15 17 its designee, or law enforcement officials to release such
 15 18 a complaint, including the identity of the child. The bill
 15 19 amends Code section 915.25 to provide that such a complaint
 15 20 is confidential unless the complaint alleges that the child
 15 21 committed a delinquent act that if committed by an adult would
 15 22 be a forcible felony. However, the bill authorizes state and
 15 23 local enforcement officials to release a confidential complaint
 15 24 against a child if the child is at large and doing so is deemed
 15 25 necessary for the protection of the public or the safety of
 15 26 the child. If the complaint is not confidential because the
 15 27 alleged delinquent act is an act that would be a forcible
 15 28 felony if committed by an adult, the court, its designee,
 15 29 or law enforcement officials may release such a complaint,
 15 30 including the identity of the child.
 15 31    The bill provides that an intake or juvenile court officer
 15 32 shall disclose to the alleged victim of a delinquent act, upon
 15 33 request, the complaint, the name and address of the child who
 15 34 allegedly committed the delinquent act, and the disposition
 15 35 of the complaint. If the alleged delinquent act would be
 16  1 a forcible felony if committed by an adult, the intake or
 16  2 juvenile court officer shall provide notification to the victim
 16  3 as required by Code section 915.24.
 16  4    SEALING OF JUVENILE COURT RECORDS UNAVAILABLE FOR
 16  5 OPERATING=WHILE=INTOXICATED VIOLATIONS.  Under current Code
 16  6 section 232.150, a court shall order juvenile court records
 16  7 to be sealed if the person who is the subject of the juvenile
 16  8 court records is 18 years of age or older and 2 years have
 16  9 elapsed since the last official action in the person's case,
 16 10 the person has not been subsequently convicted of a felony
 16 11 or an aggravated or serious misdemeanor or adjudicated a
 16 12 delinquent child for an act which if committed by an adult
 16 13 would be a felony, an aggravated misdemeanor, or a serious
 16 14 misdemeanor and no proceeding is pending seeking such
 16 15 conviction or adjudication, and the person was not placed on
 16 16 youthful offender status, transferred back to district court
 16 17 after the youthful offender's 18th birthday, and sentenced for
 16 18 the offense which precipitated the youthful offender placement.
 16 19 The bill in newly designated Code section 232.150(4) provides
 16 20 that the court shall not seal a person's juvenile court records
 16 21 if the person was adjudicated delinquent for violating Code
 16 22 section 321J.2, which prohibits the operation of a motor
 16 23 vehicle while under the influence of alcohol or a drug.
 16 24    RELEASE OF CONFIDENTIAL RECORDS.  The bill provides that a
 16 25 public record which is confidential under the provisions of
 16 26 Code chapter 232 shall only be subject to release upon order of
 16 27 a court in a proceeding under Code chapter 232.
 16 28    EXISTING CONFIDENTIALITY EXEMPTIONS.  The bill retains
 16 29 certain existing exemptions to confidentiality of juvenile
 16 30 court records. Pursuant to Code section 692A.121(8), records
 16 31 concerning sex offense convictions which are committed by
 16 32 minors may be released in the same manner as records of
 16 33 convictions of adults. Pursuant to Code section 915.10A,
 16 34 information concerning a juvenile charged with a felony offense
 16 35 may be released pursuant to an automated victim notification
 17  1 system. Under the bill, these exemptions to confidentiality
 17  2 are not amended and therefore still apply to juvenile court
 17  3 records.
 17  4    RIGHT TO COUNSEL.  The bill in Code section 232.11 provides
 17  5 that a child has the right to be represented by counsel at a
 17  6 hearing on a confidentiality order under Code section 232.149A
 17  7 or a public records order under Code section 232.149B.

 14  4 juvenile justice agency, an intake officer, or a juvenile court
 14  5 officer concerning a child involved in a delinquent act are

 14  7 intake officer or juvenile court officer containing a dismissal
 14  8 of a complaint or an informal adjustment of a complaint when
 14  9 no petition is filed relating to the complaint, shall not be
 14 10 available to the public, but may be disclosed to the judge and

 14 25 order to make confidential juvenile court records public.
 14 26 The bill provides that a rebuttable presumption exists that
 14 27 official juvenile court records shall remain confidential. The
 14 28 bill provides that the court shall order the official juvenile
 14 29 court records in such a delinquency proceeding to be public
 14 30 records if either the public's interest in making the records
 14 31 public outweighs the juvenile's interest in maintaining the
 14 32 confidentiality of the records or the juvenile has been placed
 14 33 on youthful offender status pursuant to Code section 232.45(7)
 14 34 and Code section 907.3A(1), and will be transferred back to
 14 35 the district court for sentencing prior to the child's 18th
 15  1 birthday. The court may order the official juvenile court
 15  2 records in such a delinquency proceeding to be public records
 15  3 if the juvenile has been subsequently adjudicated delinquent
 15  4 for a public offense that would be a serious misdemeanor,
 15  5 aggravated misdemeanor, or felony offense if committed by an
 15  6 adult, or another delinquency proceeding is pending seeking
 15  7 such an adjudication. The bill provides that records subject
 15  8 to a public records order may be sealed at a later date
 15  9 pursuant to Code section 232.150.
 15 10    RIGHT TO REVIEW AND RELEASE A CONFIDENTIAL COMPLAINT.  The
 15 11 bill provides that delinquency complaints shall be released
 15 12 in accordance with Code section 915.25. Under current Code
 15 13 section 915.25, a complaint which alleges that a child who is
 15 14 at least 10 years of age committed a delinquent act, which if
 15 15 committed by an adult would be a public offense, is a public
 15 16 record. Current Code section 915.25 authorizes the court,
 15 17 its designee, or law enforcement officials to release such
 15 18 a complaint, including the identity of the child. The bill
 15 19 amends Code section 915.25 to provide that such a complaint
 15 20 is confidential unless the complaint alleges that the child
 15 21 committed a delinquent act that if committed by an adult would
 15 22 be a forcible felony. However, the bill authorizes state and
 15 23 local enforcement officials to release a confidential complaint
 15 24 against a child if the child is at large and doing so is deemed
 15 25 necessary for the protection of the public or the safety of
 15 26 the child. If the complaint is not confidential because the
 15 27 alleged delinquent act is an act that would be a forcible
 15 28 felony if committed by an adult, the court, its designee,
 15 29 or law enforcement officials may release such a complaint,
 15 30 including the identity of the child.
 15 31    The bill provides that an intake or juvenile court officer
 15 32 shall disclose to the alleged victim of a delinquent act, upon
 15 33 request, the complaint, the name and address of the child who
 15 34 allegedly committed the delinquent act, and the disposition
 15 35 of the complaint. If the alleged delinquent act would be
 16  1 a forcible felony if committed by an adult, the intake or
 16  2 juvenile court officer shall provide notification to the victim
 16  3 as required by Code section 915.24.
 16  4    SEALING OF JUVENILE COURT RECORDS UNAVAILABLE FOR
 16  5 OPERATING=WHILE=INTOXICATED VIOLATIONS.  Under current Code
 16  6 section 232.150, a court shall order juvenile court records
 16  7 to be sealed if the person who is the subject of the juvenile
 16  8 court records is 18 years of age or older and 2 years have
 16  9 elapsed since the last official action in the person's case,
 16 10 the person has not been subsequently convicted of a felony
 16 11 or an aggravated or serious misdemeanor or adjudicated a
 16 12 delinquent child for an act which if committed by an adult
 16 13 would be a felony, an aggravated misdemeanor, or a serious
 16 14 misdemeanor and no proceeding is pending seeking such
 16 15 conviction or adjudication, and the person was not placed on
 16 16 youthful offender status, transferred back to district court
 16 17 after the youthful offender's 18th birthday, and sentenced for
 16 18 the offense which precipitated the youthful offender placement.

 16 20 that the court shall not seal a person's juvenile court records
 16 21 if the person was adjudicated delinquent for violating Code
 16 22 section 321J.2, which prohibits the operation of a motor

 14 25 order to make confidential juvenile court records public.
 14 26 The bill provides that a rebuttable presumption exists that
 14 27 official juvenile court records shall remain confidential. The
 14 28 bill provides that the court shall order the official juvenile
 14 29 court records in such a delinquency proceeding to be public
 14 30 records if either the public's interest in making the records
 14 31 public outweighs the juvenile's interest in maintaining the
 14 32 confidentiality of the records or the juvenile has been placed
 14 33 on youthful offender status pursuant to Code section 232.45(7)
 14 34 and Code section 907.3A(1), and will be transferred back to
 14 35 the district court for sentencing prior to the child's 18th
 15  1 birthday. The court may order the official juvenile court
 15  2 records in such a delinquency proceeding to be public records
 15  3 if the juvenile has been subsequently adjudicated delinquent
 15  4 for a public offense that would be a serious misdemeanor,
 15  5 aggravated misdemeanor, or felony offense if committed by an
 15  6 adult, or another delinquency proceeding is pending seeking
 15  7 such an adjudication. The bill provides that records subject
 15  8 to a public records order may be sealed at a later date
 15  9 pursuant to Code section 232.150.
 15 10    RIGHT TO REVIEW AND RELEASE A CONFIDENTIAL COMPLAINT.  The
 15 11 bill provides that delinquency complaints shall be released
 15 12 in accordance with Code section 915.25. Under current Code
 15 13 section 915.25, a complaint which alleges that a child who is
 15 14 at least 10 years of age committed a delinquent act, which if
 15 15 committed by an adult would be a public offense, is a public
 15 16 record. Current Code section 915.25 authorizes the court,
 15 17 its designee, or law enforcement officials to release such
 15 18 a complaint, including the identity of the child. The bill
 15 19 amends Code section 915.25 to provide that such a complaint
 15 20 is confidential unless the complaint alleges that the child
 15 21 committed a delinquent act that if committed by an adult would
 15 22 be a forcible felony. However, the bill authorizes state and
 15 23 local enforcement officials to release a confidential complaint
 15 24 against a child if the child is at large and doing so is deemed

 15 26 the child. If the complaint is not confidential because the
 15 27 alleged delinquent act is an act that would be a forcible
 15 28 felony if committed by an adult, the court, its designee,
 15 29 or law enforcement officials may release such a complaint,
 15 30 including the identity of the child.
 15 31    The bill provides that an intake or juvenile court officer
 15 32 shall disclose to the alleged victim of a delinquent act, upon
 15 33 request, the complaint, the name and address of the child who
 15 34 allegedly committed the delinquent act, and the disposition
 15 35 of the complaint. If the alleged delinquent act would be
 16  1 a forcible felony if committed by an adult, the intake or
 16  2 juvenile court officer shall provide notification to the victim
 16  3 as required by Code section 915.24.
 16  4    SEALING OF JUVENILE COURT RECORDS UNAVAILABLE FOR
 16  5 OPERATING=WHILE=INTOXICATED VIOLATIONS.  Under current Code
 16  6 section 232.150, a court shall order juvenile court records
 16  7 to be sealed if the person who is the subject of the juvenile
 16  8 court records is 18 years of age or older and 2 years have
 16  9 elapsed since the last official action in the person's case,
 16 10 the person has not been subsequently convicted of a felony
 16 11 or an aggravated or serious misdemeanor or adjudicated a
 16 12 delinquent child for an act which if committed by an adult
 16 13 would be a felony, an aggravated misdemeanor, or a serious
 16 14 misdemeanor and no proceeding is pending seeking such
 16 15 conviction or adjudication, and the person was not placed on
 16 16 youthful offender status, transferred back to district court
 16 17 after the youthful offender's 18th birthday, and sentenced for
 16 18 the offense which precipitated the youthful offender placement.
 16 19 The bill in newly designated Code section 232.150(4) provides
 16 20 that the court shall not seal a person's juvenile court records
 16 21 if the person was adjudicated delinquent for violating Code
 16 22 section 321J.2, which prohibits the operation of a motor
 16 23 vehicle while under the influence of alcohol or a drug.
 16 24    RELEASE OF CONFIDENTIAL RECORDS.  The bill provides that a
 16 25 public record which is confidential under the provisions of
 16 26 Code chapter 232 shall only be subject to release upon order of
 16 27 a court in a proceeding under Code chapter 232.
 16 28    EXISTING CONFIDENTIALITY EXEMPTIONS.  The bill retains
 16 29 certain existing exemptions to confidentiality of juvenile
 16 30 court records. Pursuant to Code section 692A.121(8), records
 16 31 concerning sex offense convictions which are committed by
 16 32 minors may be released in the same manner as records of
 16 33 convictions of adults. Pursuant to Code section 915.10A,
 16 34 information concerning a juvenile charged with a felony offense
 16 35 may be released pursuant to an automated victim notification
 17  1 system. Under the bill, these exemptions to confidentiality
 17  2 are not amended and therefore still apply to juvenile court
 17  3 records.
 17  4    RIGHT TO COUNSEL.  The bill in Code section 232.11 provides
 17  5 that a child has the right to be represented by counsel at a
 17  6 hearing on a confidentiality order under Code section 232.149A
 17  7 or a public records order under Code section 232.149B.
 17  8    APPLICABILITY.  The bill applies to juvenile delinquency

 14  6 confidential. The bill further provides that the records of an
 14  7 intake officer or juvenile court officer containing a dismissal
 14  8 of a complaint or an informal adjustment of a complaint when
 14  9 no petition is filed relating to the complaint, shall not be
 14 10 available to the public, but may be disclosed to the judge and
 14 11 professional court staff, including juvenile court officers;
 14 12 the child's counsel or guardian ad litem; the county attorney
 14 13 and county attorney's assistants;  the superintendent or the
 14 14 superintendent's designee of the school district for the
 14 15 school attended by the child or the authorities in charge of
 14 16 an accredited nonpublic school attended by the child; a member
 14 17 of the armed forces of the United States who is conducting a
 14 18 background investigation of an individual pursuant to federal
 14 19 law; the statistical analysis center for the purposes stated
 14 20 in Code section 216A.136; the state public defender;  the
 14 21 department of human services; and the alleged victim of the
 14 22 delinquent act.
 14 23    PUBLIC RECORDS HEARINGS.  The bill enacts new Code section
 14 24 232.149B, which provides that a person may apply for a court
 14 25 order to make confidential juvenile court records public.
 14 26 The bill provides that a rebuttable presumption exists that
 14 27 official juvenile court records shall remain confidential. The
 14 28 bill provides that the court shall order the official juvenile
 14 29 court records in such a delinquency proceeding to be public
 14 30 records if either the public's interest in making the records
 14 31 public outweighs the juvenile's interest in maintaining the
 14 32 confidentiality of the records or the juvenile has been placed
 14 33 on youthful offender status pursuant to Code section 232.45(7)
 14 34 and Code section 907.3A(1), and will be transferred back to
 14 35 the district court for sentencing prior to the child's 18th
 15  1 birthday. The court may order the official juvenile court
 15  2 records in such a delinquency proceeding to be public records
 15  3 if the juvenile has been subsequently adjudicated delinquent
 15  4 for a public offense that would be a serious misdemeanor,
 15  5 aggravated misdemeanor, or felony offense if committed by an
 15  6 adult, or another delinquency proceeding is pending seeking
 15  7 such an adjudication. The bill provides that records subject
 15  8 to a public records order may be sealed at a later date
 15  9 pursuant to Code section 232.150.
 15 10    RIGHT TO REVIEW AND RELEASE A CONFIDENTIAL COMPLAINT.  The
 15 11 bill provides that delinquency complaints shall be released
 15 12 in accordance with Code section 915.25. Under current Code
 15 13 section 915.25, a complaint which alleges that a child who is
 15 14 at least 10 years of age committed a delinquent act, which if
 15 15 committed by an adult would be a public offense, is a public
 15 16 record. Current Code section 915.25 authorizes the court,
 15 17 its designee, or law enforcement officials to release such
 15 18 a complaint, including the identity of the child. The bill
 15 19 amends Code section 915.25 to provide that such a complaint
 15 20 is confidential unless the complaint alleges that the child
 15 21 committed a delinquent act that if committed by an adult would
 15 22 be a forcible felony. However, the bill authorizes state and
 15 23 local enforcement officials to release a confidential complaint
 15 24 against a child if the child is at large and doing so is deemed
 15 25 necessary for the protection of the public or the safety of
 15 26 the child. If the complaint is not confidential because the
 15 27 alleged delinquent act is an act that would be a forcible
 15 28 felony if committed by an adult, the court, its designee,
 15 29 or law enforcement officials may release such a complaint,
 15 30 including the identity of the child.
 15 31    The bill provides that an intake or juvenile court officer
 15 32 shall disclose to the alleged victim of a delinquent act, upon
 15 33 request, the complaint, the name and address of the child who
 15 34 allegedly committed the delinquent act, and the disposition
 15 35 of the complaint. If the alleged delinquent act would be
 16  1 a forcible felony if committed by an adult, the intake or
 16  2 juvenile court officer shall provide notification to the victim
 16  3 as required by Code section 915.24.
 16  4    SEALING OF JUVENILE COURT RECORDS UNAVAILABLE FOR
 16  5 OPERATING=WHILE=INTOXICATED VIOLATIONS.  Under current Code
 16  6 section 232.150, a court shall order juvenile court records
 16  7 to be sealed if the person who is the subject of the juvenile
 16  8 court records is 18 years of age or older and 2 years have
 16  9 elapsed since the last official action in the person's case,
 16 10 the person has not been subsequently convicted of a felony
 16 11 or an aggravated or serious misdemeanor or adjudicated a
 16 12 delinquent child for an act which if committed by an adult
 16 13 would be a felony, an aggravated misdemeanor, or a serious
 16 14 misdemeanor and no proceeding is pending seeking such
 16 15 conviction or adjudication, and the person was not placed on
 16 16 youthful offender status, transferred back to district court
 16 17 after the youthful offender's 18th birthday, and sentenced for
 16 18 the offense which precipitated the youthful offender placement.
 16 19 The bill in newly designated Code section 232.150(4) provides
 16 20 that the court shall not seal a person's juvenile court records
 16 21 if the person was adjudicated delinquent for violating Code
 16 22 section 321J.2, which prohibits the operation of a motor
 16 23 vehicle while under the influence of alcohol or a drug.
 16 24    RELEASE OF CONFIDENTIAL RECORDS.  The bill provides that a
 16 25 public record which is confidential under the provisions of
 16 26 Code chapter 232 shall only be subject to release upon order of
 16 27 a court in a proceeding under Code chapter 232.
 16 28    EXISTING CONFIDENTIALITY EXEMPTIONS.  The bill retains
 16 29 certain existing exemptions to confidentiality of juvenile
 16 30 court records. Pursuant to Code section 692A.121(8), records
 16 31 concerning sex offense convictions which are committed by
 16 32 minors may be released in the same manner as records of

 16 35 may be released pursuant to an automated victim notification

 17  2 are not amended and therefore still apply to juvenile court
 17  3 records.
 17  4    RIGHT TO COUNSEL.  The bill in Code section 232.11 provides
 17  5 that a child has the right to be represented by counsel at a
 17  6 hearing on a confidentiality order under Code section 232.149A
 17  7 or a public records order under Code section 232.149B.

 14 24 232.149B, which provides that a person may apply for a court
 14 25 order to make confidential juvenile court records public.
 14 26 The bill provides that a rebuttable presumption exists that
 14 27 official juvenile court records shall remain confidential. The
 14 28 bill provides that the court shall order the official juvenile
 14 29 court records in such a delinquency proceeding to be public
 14 30 records if either the public's interest in making the records
 14 31 public outweighs the juvenile's interest in maintaining the
 14 32 confidentiality of the records or the juvenile has been placed
 14 33 on youthful offender status pursuant to Code section 232.45(7)
 14 34 and Code section 907.3A(1), and will be transferred back to
 14 35 the district court for sentencing prior to the child's 18th
 15  1 birthday. The court may order the official juvenile court
 15  2 records in such a delinquency proceeding to be public records
 15  3 if the juvenile has been subsequently adjudicated delinquent
 15  4 for a public offense that would be a serious misdemeanor,
 15  5 aggravated misdemeanor, or felony offense if committed by an
 15  6 adult, or another delinquency proceeding is pending seeking
 15  7 such an adjudication. The bill provides that records subject
 15  8 to a public records order may be sealed at a later date
 15  9 pursuant to Code section 232.150.
 15 10    RIGHT TO REVIEW AND RELEASE A CONFIDENTIAL COMPLAINT.  The
 15 11 bill provides that delinquency complaints shall be released
 15 12 in accordance with Code section 915.25. Under current Code
 15 13 section 915.25, a complaint which alleges that a child who is
 15 14 at least 10 years of age committed a delinquent act, which if
 15 15 committed by an adult would be a public offense, is a public
 15 16 record. Current Code section 915.25 authorizes the court,
 15 17 its designee, or law enforcement officials to release such
 15 18 a complaint, including the identity of the child. The bill
 15 19 amends Code section 915.25 to provide that such a complaint
 15 20 is confidential unless the complaint alleges that the child
 15 21 committed a delinquent act that if committed by an adult would
 15 22 be a forcible felony. However, the bill authorizes state and
 15 23 local enforcement officials to release a confidential complaint
 15 24 against a child if the child is at large and doing so is deemed
 15 25 necessary for the protection of the public or the safety of
 15 26 the child. If the complaint is not confidential because the
 15 27 alleged delinquent act is an act that would be a forcible
 15 28 felony if committed by an adult, the court, its designee,
 15 29 or law enforcement officials may release such a complaint,
 15 30 including the identity of the child.
 15 31    The bill provides that an intake or juvenile court officer
 15 32 shall disclose to the alleged victim of a delinquent act, upon
 15 33 request, the complaint, the name and address of the child who
 15 34 allegedly committed the delinquent act, and the disposition
 15 35 of the complaint. If the alleged delinquent act would be
 16  1 a forcible felony if committed by an adult, the intake or
 16  2 juvenile court officer shall provide notification to the victim
 16  3 as required by Code section 915.24.
 16  4    SEALING OF JUVENILE COURT RECORDS UNAVAILABLE FOR
 16  5 OPERATING=WHILE=INTOXICATED VIOLATIONS.  Under current Code
 16  6 section 232.150, a court shall order juvenile court records
 16  7 to be sealed if the person who is the subject of the juvenile
 16  8 court records is 18 years of age or older and 2 years have
 16  9 elapsed since the last official action in the person's case,
 16 10 the person has not been subsequently convicted of a felony
 16 11 or an aggravated or serious misdemeanor or adjudicated a
 16 12 delinquent child for an act which if committed by an adult
 16 13 would be a felony, an aggravated misdemeanor, or a serious
 16 14 misdemeanor and no proceeding is pending seeking such
 16 15 conviction or adjudication, and the person was not placed on
 16 16 youthful offender status, transferred back to district court
 16 17 after the youthful offender's 18th birthday, and sentenced for
 16 18 the offense which precipitated the youthful offender placement.
 16 19 The bill in newly designated Code section 232.150(4) provides
 16 20 that the court shall not seal a person's juvenile court records
 16 21 if the person was adjudicated delinquent for violating Code
 16 22 section 321J.2, which prohibits the operation of a motor
 16 23 vehicle while under the influence of alcohol or a drug.
 16 24    RELEASE OF CONFIDENTIAL RECORDS.  The bill provides that a

 15 10    RIGHT TO REVIEW AND RELEASE A CONFIDENTIAL COMPLAINT.  The
 15 11 bill provides that delinquency complaints shall be released
 15 12 in accordance with Code section 915.25. Under current Code
 15 13 section 915.25, a complaint which alleges that a child who is
 15 14 at least 10 years of age committed a delinquent act, which if
 15 15 committed by an adult would be a public offense, is a public
 15 16 record. Current Code section 915.25 authorizes the court,
 15 17 its designee, or law enforcement officials to release such
 15 18 a complaint, including the identity of the child. The bill
 15 19 amends Code section 915.25 to provide that such a complaint
 15 20 is confidential unless the complaint alleges that the child
 15 21 committed a delinquent act that if committed by an adult would
 15 22 be a forcible felony. However, the bill authorizes state and
 15 23 local enforcement officials to release a confidential complaint
 15 24 against a child if the child is at large and doing so is deemed
 15 25 necessary for the protection of the public or the safety of
 15 26 the child. If the complaint is not confidential because the
 15 27 alleged delinquent act is an act that would be a forcible
 15 28 felony if committed by an adult, the court, its designee,
 15 29 or law enforcement officials may release such a complaint,
 15 30 including the identity of the child.
 15 31    The bill provides that an intake or juvenile court officer
 15 32 shall disclose to the alleged victim of a delinquent act, upon
 15 33 request, the complaint, the name and address of the child who
 15 34 allegedly committed the delinquent act, and the disposition
 15 35 of the complaint. If the alleged delinquent act would be
 16  1 a forcible felony if committed by an adult, the intake or
 16  2 juvenile court officer shall provide notification to the victim
 16  3 as required by Code section 915.24.
 16  4    SEALING OF JUVENILE COURT RECORDS UNAVAILABLE FOR
 16  5 OPERATING=WHILE=INTOXICATED VIOLATIONS.  Under current Code
 16  6 section 232.150, a court shall order juvenile court records
 16  7 to be sealed if the person who is the subject of the juvenile
 16  8 court records is 18 years of age or older and 2 years have
 16  9 elapsed since the last official action in the person's case,
 16 10 the person has not been subsequently convicted of a felony
 16 11 or an aggravated or serious misdemeanor or adjudicated a
 16 12 delinquent child for an act which if committed by an adult
 16 13 would be a felony, an aggravated misdemeanor, or a serious
 16 14 misdemeanor and no proceeding is pending seeking such
 16 15 conviction or adjudication, and the person was not placed on
 16 16 youthful offender status, transferred back to district court
 16 17 after the youthful offender's 18th birthday, and sentenced for
 16 18 the offense which precipitated the youthful offender placement.
 16 19 The bill in newly designated Code section 232.150(4) provides
 16 20 that the court shall not seal a person's juvenile court records
 16 21 if the person was adjudicated delinquent for violating Code
 16 22 section 321J.2, which prohibits the operation of a motor
 16 23 vehicle while under the influence of alcohol or a drug.
 16 24    RELEASE OF CONFIDENTIAL RECORDS.  The bill provides that a
 16 25 public record which is confidential under the provisions of
 16 26 Code chapter 232 shall only be subject to release upon order of
 16 27 a court in a proceeding under Code chapter 232.
 16 28    EXISTING CONFIDENTIALITY EXEMPTIONS.  The bill retains
 16 29 certain existing exemptions to confidentiality of juvenile
 16 30 court records. Pursuant to Code section 692A.121(8), records
 16 31 concerning sex offense convictions which are committed by
 16 32 minors may be released in the same manner as records of
 16 33 convictions of adults. Pursuant to Code section 915.10A,
 16 34 information concerning a juvenile charged with a felony offense
 16 35 may be released pursuant to an automated victim notification
 17  1 system. Under the bill, these exemptions to confidentiality
 17  2 are not amended and therefore still apply to juvenile court
 17  3 records.
 17  4    RIGHT TO COUNSEL.  The bill in Code section 232.11 provides
 17  5 that a child has the right to be represented by counsel at a
 17  6 hearing on a confidentiality order under Code section 232.149A
 17  7 or a public records order under Code section 232.149B.

 14 22 delinquent act.
 14 23    PUBLIC RECORDS HEARINGS.  The bill enacts new Code section
 14 24 232.149B, which provides that a person may apply for a court
 14 25 order to make confidential juvenile court records public.
 14 26 The bill provides that a rebuttable presumption exists that
 14 27 official juvenile court records shall remain confidential. The
 14 28 bill provides that the court shall order the official juvenile
 14 29 court records in such a delinquency proceeding to be public
 14 30 records if either the public's interest in making the records
 14 31 public outweighs the juvenile's interest in maintaining the
 14 32 confidentiality of the records or the juvenile has been placed
 14 33 on youthful offender status pursuant to Code section 232.45(7)
 14 34 and Code section 907.3A(1), and will be transferred back to
 14 35 the district court for sentencing prior to the child's 18th
 15  1 birthday. The court may order the official juvenile court
 15  2 records in such a delinquency proceeding to be public records
 15  3 if the juvenile has been subsequently adjudicated delinquent
 15  4 for a public offense that would be a serious misdemeanor,
 15  5 aggravated misdemeanor, or felony offense if committed by an
 15  6 adult, or another delinquency proceeding is pending seeking
 15  7 such an adjudication. The bill provides that records subject
 15  8 to a public records order may be sealed at a later date
 15  9 pursuant to Code section 232.150.
 15 10    RIGHT TO REVIEW AND RELEASE A CONFIDENTIAL COMPLAINT.  The
 15 11 bill provides that delinquency complaints shall be released
 15 12 in accordance with Code section 915.25. Under current Code
 15 13 section 915.25, a complaint which alleges that a child who is
 15 14 at least 10 years of age committed a delinquent act, which if
 15 15 committed by an adult would be a public offense, is a public
 15 16 record. Current Code section 915.25 authorizes the court,
 15 17 its designee, or law enforcement officials to release such
 15 18 a complaint, including the identity of the child. The bill
 15 19 amends Code section 915.25 to provide that such a complaint
 15 20 is confidential unless the complaint alleges that the child
 15 21 committed a delinquent act that if committed by an adult would
 15 22 be a forcible felony. However, the bill authorizes state and
 15 23 local enforcement officials to release a confidential complaint
 15 24 against a child if the child is at large and doing so is deemed
 15 25 necessary for the protection of the public or the safety of
 15 26 the child. If the complaint is not confidential because the
 15 27 alleged delinquent act is an act that would be a forcible
 15 28 felony if committed by an adult, the court, its designee,
 15 29 or law enforcement officials may release such a complaint,
 15 30 including the identity of the child.
 15 31    The bill provides that an intake or juvenile court officer
 15 32 shall disclose to the alleged victim of a delinquent act, upon
 15 33 request, the complaint, the name and address of the child who
 15 34 allegedly committed the delinquent act, and the disposition
 15 35 of the complaint. If the alleged delinquent act would be
 16  1 a forcible felony if committed by an adult, the intake or
 16  2 juvenile court officer shall provide notification to the victim
 16  3 as required by Code section 915.24.
 16  4    SEALING OF JUVENILE COURT RECORDS UNAVAILABLE FOR
 16  5 OPERATING=WHILE=INTOXICATED VIOLATIONS.  Under current Code
 16  6 section 232.150, a court shall order juvenile court records
 16  7 to be sealed if the person who is the subject of the juvenile
 16  8 court records is 18 years of age or older and 2 years have
 16  9 elapsed since the last official action in the person's case,
 16 10 the person has not been subsequently convicted of a felony
 16 11 or an aggravated or serious misdemeanor or adjudicated a

 16 13 would be a felony, an aggravated misdemeanor, or a serious

 16 16 youthful offender status, transferred back to district court
 16 17 after the youthful offender's 18th birthday, and sentenced for
 16 18 the offense which precipitated the youthful offender placement.
 16 19 The bill in newly designated Code section 232.150(4) provides
 16 20 that the court shall not seal a person's juvenile court records
 16 21 if the person was adjudicated delinquent for violating Code
 16 22 section 321J.2, which prohibits the operation of a motor
 16 23 vehicle while under the influence of alcohol or a drug.
 16 24    RELEASE OF CONFIDENTIAL RECORDS.  The bill provides that a
 16 25 public record which is confidential under the provisions of

 16 27 a court in a proceeding under Code chapter 232.

 14 25 order to make confidential juvenile court records public.
 14 26 The bill provides that a rebuttable presumption exists that
 14 27 official juvenile court records shall remain confidential. The
 14 28 bill provides that the court shall order the official juvenile
 14 29 court records in such a delinquency proceeding to be public
 14 30 records if either the public's interest in making the records
 14 31 public outweighs the juvenile's interest in maintaining the
 14 32 confidentiality of the records or the juvenile has been placed
 14 33 on youthful offender status pursuant to Code section 232.45(7)
 14 34 and Code section 907.3A(1), and will be transferred back to
 14 35 the district court for sentencing prior to the child's 18th
 15  1 birthday. The court may order the official juvenile court
 15  2 records in such a delinquency proceeding to be public records
 15  3 if the juvenile has been subsequently adjudicated delinquent
 15  4 for a public offense that would be a serious misdemeanor,
 15  5 aggravated misdemeanor, or felony offense if committed by an
 15  6 adult, or another delinquency proceeding is pending seeking
 15  7 such an adjudication. The bill provides that records subject
 15  8 to a public records order may be sealed at a later date
 15  9 pursuant to Code section 232.150.
 15 10    RIGHT TO REVIEW AND RELEASE A CONFIDENTIAL COMPLAINT.  The
 15 11 bill provides that delinquency complaints shall be released
 15 12 in accordance with Code section 915.25. Under current Code
 15 13 section 915.25, a complaint which alleges that a child who is
 15 14 at least 10 years of age committed a delinquent act, which if
 15 15 committed by an adult would be a public offense, is a public
 15 16 record. Current Code section 915.25 authorizes the court,
 15 17 its designee, or law enforcement officials to release such
 15 18 a complaint, including the identity of the child. The bill
 15 19 amends Code section 915.25 to provide that such a complaint
 15 20 is confidential unless the complaint alleges that the child
 15 21 committed a delinquent act that if committed by an adult would
 15 22 be a forcible felony. However, the bill authorizes state and
 15 23 local enforcement officials to release a confidential complaint
 15 24 against a child if the child is at large and doing so is deemed
 15 25 necessary for the protection of the public or the safety of
 15 26 the child. If the complaint is not confidential because the
 15 27 alleged delinquent act is an act that would be a forcible
 15 28 felony if committed by an adult, the court, its designee,
 15 29 or law enforcement officials may release such a complaint,
 15 30 including the identity of the child.
 15 31    The bill provides that an intake or juvenile court officer
 15 32 shall disclose to the alleged victim of a delinquent act, upon
 15 33 request, the complaint, the name and address of the child who
 15 34 allegedly committed the delinquent act, and the disposition
 15 35 of the complaint. If the alleged delinquent act would be
 16  1 a forcible felony if committed by an adult, the intake or
 16  2 juvenile court officer shall provide notification to the victim
 16  3 as required by Code section 915.24.
 16  4    SEALING OF JUVENILE COURT RECORDS UNAVAILABLE FOR
 16  5 OPERATING=WHILE=INTOXICATED VIOLATIONS.  Under current Code
 16  6 section 232.150, a court shall order juvenile court records
 16  7 to be sealed if the person who is the subject of the juvenile
 16  8 court records is 18 years of age or older and 2 years have
 16  9 elapsed since the last official action in the person's case,
 16 10 the person has not been subsequently convicted of a felony
 16 11 or an aggravated or serious misdemeanor or adjudicated a
 16 12 delinquent child for an act which if committed by an adult
 16 13 would be a felony, an aggravated misdemeanor, or a serious
 16 14 misdemeanor and no proceeding is pending seeking such
 16 15 conviction or adjudication, and the person was not placed on
 16 16 youthful offender status, transferred back to district court
 16 17 after the youthful offender's 18th birthday, and sentenced for
 16 18 the offense which precipitated the youthful offender placement.
 16 19 The bill in newly designated Code section 232.150(4) provides
 16 20 that the court shall not seal a person's juvenile court records
 16 21 if the person was adjudicated delinquent for violating Code
 16 22 section 321J.2, which prohibits the operation of a motor
 16 23 vehicle while under the influence of alcohol or a drug.
 16 24    RELEASE OF CONFIDENTIAL RECORDS.  The bill provides that a
 16 25 public record which is confidential under the provisions of
 16 26 Code chapter 232 shall only be subject to release upon order of
 16 27 a court in a proceeding under Code chapter 232.
 16 28    EXISTING CONFIDENTIALITY EXEMPTIONS.  The bill retains
 16 29 certain existing exemptions to confidentiality of juvenile
 16 30 court records. Pursuant to Code section 692A.121(8), records
 16 31 concerning sex offense convictions which are committed by
 16 32 minors may be released in the same manner as records of
 16 33 convictions of adults. Pursuant to Code section 915.10A,
 16 34 information concerning a juvenile charged with a felony offense
 16 35 may be released pursuant to an automated victim notification
 17  1 system. Under the bill, these exemptions to confidentiality
 17  2 are not amended and therefore still apply to juvenile court
 17  3 records.
 17  4    RIGHT TO COUNSEL.  The bill in Code section 232.11 provides
 17  5 that a child has the right to be represented by counsel at a
 17  6 hearing on a confidentiality order under Code section 232.149A
 17  7 or a public records order under Code section 232.149B.
 17  8    APPLICABILITY.  The bill applies to juvenile delinquency

 15 20 is confidential unless the complaint alleges that the child
 15 21 committed a delinquent act that if committed by an adult would

 15 34 allegedly committed the delinquent act, and the disposition

 14 22 delinquent act.
 14 23    PUBLIC RECORDS HEARINGS.  The bill enacts new Code section
 14 24 232.149B, which provides that a person may apply for a court
 14 25 order to make confidential juvenile court records public.
 14 26 The bill provides that a rebuttable presumption exists that
 14 27 official juvenile court records shall remain confidential. The
 14 28 bill provides that the court shall order the official juvenile
 14 29 court records in such a delinquency proceeding to be public
 14 30 records if either the public's interest in making the records
 14 31 public outweighs the juvenile's interest in maintaining the
 14 32 confidentiality of the records or the juvenile has been placed
 14 33 on youthful offender status pursuant to Code section 232.45(7)
 14 34 and Code section 907.3A(1), and will be transferred back to
 14 35 the district court for sentencing prior to the child's 18th
 15  1 birthday. The court may order the official juvenile court
 15  2 records in such a delinquency proceeding to be public records
 15  3 if the juvenile has been subsequently adjudicated delinquent
 15  4 for a public offense that would be a serious misdemeanor,
 15  5 aggravated misdemeanor, or felony offense if committed by an
 15  6 adult, or another delinquency proceeding is pending seeking
 15  7 such an adjudication. The bill provides that records subject
 15  8 to a public records order may be sealed at a later date
 15  9 pursuant to Code section 232.150.
 15 10    RIGHT TO REVIEW AND RELEASE A CONFIDENTIAL COMPLAINT.  The
 15 11 bill provides that delinquency complaints shall be released
 15 12 in accordance with Code section 915.25. Under current Code
 15 13 section 915.25, a complaint which alleges that a child who is
 15 14 at least 10 years of age committed a delinquent act, which if
 15 15 committed by an adult would be a public offense, is a public
 15 16 record. Current Code section 915.25 authorizes the court,
 15 17 its designee, or law enforcement officials to release such
 15 18 a complaint, including the identity of the child. The bill
 15 19 amends Code section 915.25 to provide that such a complaint
 15 20 is confidential unless the complaint alleges that the child
 15 21 committed a delinquent act that if committed by an adult would
 15 22 be a forcible felony. However, the bill authorizes state and
 15 23 local enforcement officials to release a confidential complaint
 15 24 against a child if the child is at large and doing so is deemed
 15 25 necessary for the protection of the public or the safety of
 15 26 the child. If the complaint is not confidential because the
 15 27 alleged delinquent act is an act that would be a forcible
 15 28 felony if committed by an adult, the court, its designee,
 15 29 or law enforcement officials may release such a complaint,
 15 30 including the identity of the child.
 15 31    The bill provides that an intake or juvenile court officer
 15 32 shall disclose to the alleged victim of a delinquent act, upon
 15 33 request, the complaint, the name and address of the child who
 15 34 allegedly committed the delinquent act, and the disposition
 15 35 of the complaint. If the alleged delinquent act would be
 16  1 a forcible felony if committed by an adult, the intake or
 16  2 juvenile court officer shall provide notification to the victim
 16  3 as required by Code section 915.24.
 16  4    SEALING OF JUVENILE COURT RECORDS UNAVAILABLE FOR
 16  5 OPERATING=WHILE=INTOXICATED VIOLATIONS.  Under current Code
 16  6 section 232.150, a court shall order juvenile court records
 16  7 to be sealed if the person who is the subject of the juvenile
 16  8 court records is 18 years of age or older and 2 years have
 16  9 elapsed since the last official action in the person's case,
 16 10 the person has not been subsequently convicted of a felony
 16 11 or an aggravated or serious misdemeanor or adjudicated a
 16 12 delinquent child for an act which if committed by an adult
 16 13 would be a felony, an aggravated misdemeanor, or a serious
 16 14 misdemeanor and no proceeding is pending seeking such
 16 15 conviction or adjudication, and the person was not placed on
 16 16 youthful offender status, transferred back to district court
 16 17 after the youthful offender's 18th birthday, and sentenced for
 16 18 the offense which precipitated the youthful offender placement.
 16 19 The bill in newly designated Code section 232.150(4) provides
 16 20 that the court shall not seal a person's juvenile court records
 16 21 if the person was adjudicated delinquent for violating Code
 16 22 section 321J.2, which prohibits the operation of a motor
 16 23 vehicle while under the influence of alcohol or a drug.
 16 24    RELEASE OF CONFIDENTIAL RECORDS.  The bill provides that a
 16 25 public record which is confidential under the provisions of
 16 26 Code chapter 232 shall only be subject to release upon order of
 16 27 a court in a proceeding under Code chapter 232.
 16 28    EXISTING CONFIDENTIALITY EXEMPTIONS.  The bill retains
 16 29 certain existing exemptions to confidentiality of juvenile
 16 30 court records. Pursuant to Code section 692A.121(8), records
 16 31 concerning sex offense convictions which are committed by
 16 32 minors may be released in the same manner as records of
 16 33 convictions of adults. Pursuant to Code section 915.10A,
 16 34 information concerning a juvenile charged with a felony offense
 16 35 may be released pursuant to an automated victim notification
 17  1 system. Under the bill, these exemptions to confidentiality
 17  2 are not amended and therefore still apply to juvenile court
 17  3 records.
 17  4    RIGHT TO COUNSEL.  The bill in Code section 232.11 provides
 17  5 that a child has the right to be represented by counsel at a

 17  7 or a public records order under Code section 232.149B.

 15 20 is confidential unless the complaint alleges that the child
 15 21 committed a delinquent act that if committed by an adult would

 15 34 allegedly committed the delinquent act, and the disposition

 14 33 on youthful offender status pursuant to Code section 232.45(7)
 14 34 and Code section 907.3A(1), and will be transferred back to
 14 35 the district court for sentencing prior to the child's 18th
 15  1 birthday. The court may order the official juvenile court
 15  2 records in such a delinquency proceeding to be public records
 15  3 if the juvenile has been subsequently adjudicated delinquent
 15  4 for a public offense that would be a serious misdemeanor,
 15  5 aggravated misdemeanor, or felony offense if committed by an
 15  6 adult, or another delinquency proceeding is pending seeking
 15  7 such an adjudication. The bill provides that records subject
 15  8 to a public records order may be sealed at a later date
 15  9 pursuant to Code section 232.150.
 15 10    RIGHT TO REVIEW AND RELEASE A CONFIDENTIAL COMPLAINT.  The
 15 11 bill provides that delinquency complaints shall be released
 15 12 in accordance with Code section 915.25. Under current Code
 15 13 section 915.25, a complaint which alleges that a child who is
 15 14 at least 10 years of age committed a delinquent act, which if
 15 15 committed by an adult would be a public offense, is a public
 15 16 record. Current Code section 915.25 authorizes the court,
 15 17 its designee, or law enforcement officials to release such
 15 18 a complaint, including the identity of the child. The bill
 15 19 amends Code section 915.25 to provide that such a complaint
 15 20 is confidential unless the complaint alleges that the child
 15 21 committed a delinquent act that if committed by an adult would
 15 22 be a forcible felony. However, the bill authorizes state and
 15 23 local enforcement officials to release a confidential complaint
 15 24 against a child if the child is at large and doing so is deemed
 15 25 necessary for the protection of the public or the safety of
 15 26 the child. If the complaint is not confidential because the
 15 27 alleged delinquent act is an act that would be a forcible
 15 28 felony if committed by an adult, the court, its designee,
 15 29 or law enforcement officials may release such a complaint,
 15 30 including the identity of the child.
 15 31    The bill provides that an intake or juvenile court officer
 15 32 shall disclose to the alleged victim of a delinquent act, upon
 15 33 request, the complaint, the name and address of the child who
 15 34 allegedly committed the delinquent act, and the disposition
 15 35 of the complaint. If the alleged delinquent act would be
 16  1 a forcible felony if committed by an adult, the intake or
 16  2 juvenile court officer shall provide notification to the victim
 16  3 as required by Code section 915.24.
 16  4    SEALING OF JUVENILE COURT RECORDS UNAVAILABLE FOR
 16  5 OPERATING=WHILE=INTOXICATED VIOLATIONS.  Under current Code
 16  6 section 232.150, a court shall order juvenile court records
 16  7 to be sealed if the person who is the subject of the juvenile
 16  8 court records is 18 years of age or older and 2 years have
 16  9 elapsed since the last official action in the person's case,
 16 10 the person has not been subsequently convicted of a felony
 16 11 or an aggravated or serious misdemeanor or adjudicated a
 16 12 delinquent child for an act which if committed by an adult
 16 13 would be a felony, an aggravated misdemeanor, or a serious
 16 14 misdemeanor and no proceeding is pending seeking such
 16 15 conviction or adjudication, and the person was not placed on
 16 16 youthful offender status, transferred back to district court
 16 17 after the youthful offender's 18th birthday, and sentenced for
 16 18 the offense which precipitated the youthful offender placement.
 16 19 The bill in newly designated Code section 232.150(4) provides
 16 20 that the court shall not seal a person's juvenile court records
 16 21 if the person was adjudicated delinquent for violating Code
 16 22 section 321J.2, which prohibits the operation of a motor
 16 23 vehicle while under the influence of alcohol or a drug.
 16 24    RELEASE OF CONFIDENTIAL RECORDS.  The bill provides that a
 16 25 public record which is confidential under the provisions of
 16 26 Code chapter 232 shall only be subject to release upon order of
 16 27 a court in a proceeding under Code chapter 232.
 16 28    EXISTING CONFIDENTIALITY EXEMPTIONS.  The bill retains
 16 29 certain existing exemptions to confidentiality of juvenile
 16 30 court records. Pursuant to Code section 692A.121(8), records
 16 31 concerning sex offense convictions which are committed by
 16 32 minors may be released in the same manner as records of
 16 33 convictions of adults. Pursuant to Code section 915.10A,
 16 34 information concerning a juvenile charged with a felony offense
 16 35 may be released pursuant to an automated victim notification
 17  1 system. Under the bill, these exemptions to confidentiality
 17  2 are not amended and therefore still apply to juvenile court
 17  3 records.
 17  4    RIGHT TO COUNSEL.  The bill in Code section 232.11 provides
 17  5 that a child has the right to be represented by counsel at a

 17  7 or a public records order under Code section 232.149B.

 14 25 order to make confidential juvenile court records public.
 14 26 The bill provides that a rebuttable presumption exists that

 14 28 bill provides that the court shall order the official juvenile
 14 29 court records in such a delinquency proceeding to be public
 14 30 records if either the public's interest in making the records
 14 31 public outweighs the juvenile's interest in maintaining the

 15 25 necessary for the protection of the public or the safety of
 15 26 the child. If the complaint is not confidential because the
 15 27 alleged delinquent act is an act that would be a forcible
 15 28 felony if committed by an adult, the court, its designee,
 15 29 or law enforcement officials may release such a complaint,
 15 30 including the identity of the child.
 15 31    The bill provides that an intake or juvenile court officer
 15 32 shall disclose to the alleged victim of a delinquent act, upon

 15 34 allegedly committed the delinquent act, and the disposition
 15 35 of the complaint. If the alleged delinquent act would be

 16  2 juvenile court officer shall provide notification to the victim
 16  3 as required by Code section 915.24.
 16  4    SEALING OF JUVENILE COURT RECORDS UNAVAILABLE FOR
 16  5 OPERATING=WHILE=INTOXICATED VIOLATIONS.  Under current Code
 16  6 section 232.150, a court shall order juvenile court records
 16  7 to be sealed if the person who is the subject of the juvenile
 16  8 court records is 18 years of age or older and 2 years have
 16  9 elapsed since the last official action in the person's case,
 16 10 the person has not been subsequently convicted of a felony
 16 11 or an aggravated or serious misdemeanor or adjudicated a
 16 12 delinquent child for an act which if committed by an adult
 16 13 would be a felony, an aggravated misdemeanor, or a serious
 16 14 misdemeanor and no proceeding is pending seeking such
 16 15 conviction or adjudication, and the person was not placed on
 16 16 youthful offender status, transferred back to district court
 16 17 after the youthful offender's 18th birthday, and sentenced for
 16 18 the offense which precipitated the youthful offender placement.
 16 19 The bill in newly designated Code section 232.150(4) provides
 16 20 that the court shall not seal a person's juvenile court records
 16 21 if the person was adjudicated delinquent for violating Code
 16 22 section 321J.2, which prohibits the operation of a motor
 16 23 vehicle while under the influence of alcohol or a drug.

 16 28    EXISTING CONFIDENTIALITY EXEMPTIONS.  The bill retains
 16 29 certain existing exemptions to confidentiality of juvenile
 16 30 court records. Pursuant to Code section 692A.121(8), records
 16 31 concerning sex offense convictions which are committed by
 16 32 minors may be released in the same manner as records of
 16 33 convictions of adults. Pursuant to Code section 915.10A,
 16 34 information concerning a juvenile charged with a felony offense
 16 35 may be released pursuant to an automated victim notification
 17  1 system. Under the bill, these exemptions to confidentiality
 17  2 are not amended and therefore still apply to juvenile court
 17  3 records.
 17  4    RIGHT TO COUNSEL.  The bill in Code section 232.11 provides
 17  5 that a child has the right to be represented by counsel at a

 14 27 official juvenile court records shall remain confidential. The
 14 28 bill provides that the court shall order the official juvenile
 14 29 court records in such a delinquency proceeding to be public
 14 30 records if either the public's interest in making the records
 14 31 public outweighs the juvenile's interest in maintaining the
 14 32 confidentiality of the records or the juvenile has been placed
 14 33 on youthful offender status pursuant to Code section 232.45(7)
 14 34 and Code section 907.3A(1), and will be transferred back to
 14 35 the district court for sentencing prior to the child's 18th
 15  1 birthday. The court may order the official juvenile court
 15  2 records in such a delinquency proceeding to be public records
 15  3 if the juvenile has been subsequently adjudicated delinquent
 15  4 for a public offense that would be a serious misdemeanor,
 15  5 aggravated misdemeanor, or felony offense if committed by an
 15  6 adult, or another delinquency proceeding is pending seeking

 15 10    RIGHT TO REVIEW AND RELEASE A CONFIDENTIAL COMPLAINT.  The
 15 11 bill provides that delinquency complaints shall be released
 15 12 in accordance with Code section 915.25. Under current Code
 15 13 section 915.25, a complaint which alleges that a child who is
 15 14 at least 10 years of age committed a delinquent act, which if
 15 15 committed by an adult would be a public offense, is a public
 15 16 record. Current Code section 915.25 authorizes the court,
 15 17 its designee, or law enforcement officials to release such
 15 18 a complaint, including the identity of the child. The bill
 15 19 amends Code section 915.25 to provide that such a complaint
 15 20 is confidential unless the complaint alleges that the child
 15 21 committed a delinquent act that if committed by an adult would
 15 22 be a forcible felony. However, the bill authorizes state and
 15 23 local enforcement officials to release a confidential complaint
 15 24 against a child if the child is at large and doing so is deemed
 15 25 necessary for the protection of the public or the safety of
 15 26 the child. If the complaint is not confidential because the

 15 31    The bill provides that an intake or juvenile court officer
 15 32 shall disclose to the alleged victim of a delinquent act, upon
 15 33 request, the complaint, the name and address of the child who
 15 34 allegedly committed the delinquent act, and the disposition
 15 35 of the complaint. If the alleged delinquent act would be
 16  1 a forcible felony if committed by an adult, the intake or
 16  2 juvenile court officer shall provide notification to the victim
 16  3 as required by Code section 915.24.

 16 10 the person has not been subsequently convicted of a felony
 16 11 or an aggravated or serious misdemeanor or adjudicated a
 16 12 delinquent child for an act which if committed by an adult
 16 13 would be a felony, an aggravated misdemeanor, or a serious
 16 14 misdemeanor and no proceeding is pending seeking such
 16 15 conviction or adjudication, and the person was not placed on

 14 31 public outweighs the juvenile's interest in maintaining the
 14 32 confidentiality of the records or the juvenile has been placed
 14 33 on youthful offender status pursuant to Code section 232.45(7)
 14 34 and Code section 907.3A(1), and will be transferred back to
 14 35 the district court for sentencing prior to the child's 18th
 15  1 birthday. The court may order the official juvenile court
 15  2 records in such a delinquency proceeding to be public records
 15  3 if the juvenile has been subsequently adjudicated delinquent
 15  4 for a public offense that would be a serious misdemeanor,
 15  5 aggravated misdemeanor, or felony offense if committed by an
 15  6 adult, or another delinquency proceeding is pending seeking
 15  7 such an adjudication. The bill provides that records subject
 15  8 to a public records order may be sealed at a later date
 15  9 pursuant to Code section 232.150.
 15 10    RIGHT TO REVIEW AND RELEASE A CONFIDENTIAL COMPLAINT.  The
 15 11 bill provides that delinquency complaints shall be released
 15 12 in accordance with Code section 915.25. Under current Code
 15 13 section 915.25, a complaint which alleges that a child who is
 15 14 at least 10 years of age committed a delinquent act, which if
 15 15 committed by an adult would be a public offense, is a public
 15 16 record. Current Code section 915.25 authorizes the court,
 15 17 its designee, or law enforcement officials to release such
 15 18 a complaint, including the identity of the child. The bill
 15 19 amends Code section 915.25 to provide that such a complaint
 15 20 is confidential unless the complaint alleges that the child
 15 21 committed a delinquent act that if committed by an adult would
 15 22 be a forcible felony. However, the bill authorizes state and
 15 23 local enforcement officials to release a confidential complaint
 15 24 against a child if the child is at large and doing so is deemed
 15 25 necessary for the protection of the public or the safety of
 15 26 the child. If the complaint is not confidential because the
 15 27 alleged delinquent act is an act that would be a forcible
 15 28 felony if committed by an adult, the court, its designee,
 15 29 or law enforcement officials may release such a complaint,
 15 30 including the identity of the child.
 15 31    The bill provides that an intake or juvenile court officer
 15 32 shall disclose to the alleged victim of a delinquent act, upon
 15 33 request, the complaint, the name and address of the child who
 15 34 allegedly committed the delinquent act, and the disposition
 15 35 of the complaint. If the alleged delinquent act would be
 16  1 a forcible felony if committed by an adult, the intake or
 16  2 juvenile court officer shall provide notification to the victim
 16  3 as required by Code section 915.24.
 16  4    SEALING OF JUVENILE COURT RECORDS UNAVAILABLE FOR
 16  5 OPERATING=WHILE=INTOXICATED VIOLATIONS.  Under current Code
 16  6 section 232.150, a court shall order juvenile court records
 16  7 to be sealed if the person who is the subject of the juvenile
 16  8 court records is 18 years of age or older and 2 years have
 16  9 elapsed since the last official action in the person's case,
 16 10 the person has not been subsequently convicted of a felony
 16 11 or an aggravated or serious misdemeanor or adjudicated a
 16 12 delinquent child for an act which if committed by an adult
 16 13 would be a felony, an aggravated misdemeanor, or a serious
 16 14 misdemeanor and no proceeding is pending seeking such
 16 15 conviction or adjudication, and the person was not placed on
 16 16 youthful offender status, transferred back to district court
 16 17 after the youthful offender's 18th birthday, and sentenced for
 16 18 the offense which precipitated the youthful offender placement.
 16 19 The bill in newly designated Code section 232.150(4) provides
 16 20 that the court shall not seal a person's juvenile court records
 16 21 if the person was adjudicated delinquent for violating Code
 16 22 section 321J.2, which prohibits the operation of a motor
 16 23 vehicle while under the influence of alcohol or a drug.
 16 24    RELEASE OF CONFIDENTIAL RECORDS.  The bill provides that a
 16 25 public record which is confidential under the provisions of
 16 26 Code chapter 232 shall only be subject to release upon order of
 16 27 a court in a proceeding under Code chapter 232.
 16 28    EXISTING CONFIDENTIALITY EXEMPTIONS.  The bill retains
 16 29 certain existing exemptions to confidentiality of juvenile
 16 30 court records. Pursuant to Code section 692A.121(8), records
 16 31 concerning sex offense convictions which are committed by
 16 32 minors may be released in the same manner as records of
 16 33 convictions of adults. Pursuant to Code section 915.10A,

 16  7 to be sealed if the person who is the subject of the juvenile
 16  8 court records is 18 years of age or older and 2 years have
 16  9 elapsed since the last official action in the person's case,
 16 10 the person has not been subsequently convicted of a felony
 16 11 or an aggravated or serious misdemeanor or adjudicated a
 16 12 delinquent child for an act which if committed by an adult
 16 13 would be a felony, an aggravated misdemeanor, or a serious
 16 14 misdemeanor and no proceeding is pending seeking such
 16 15 conviction or adjudication, and the person was not placed on
 16 16 youthful offender status, transferred back to district court
 16 17 after the youthful offender's 18th birthday, and sentenced for
 16 18 the offense which precipitated the youthful offender placement.
 16 19 The bill in newly designated Code section 232.150(4) provides
 16 20 that the court shall not seal a person's juvenile court records
 16 21 if the person was adjudicated delinquent for violating Code

 16 25 public record which is confidential under the provisions of
 16 26 Code chapter 232 shall only be subject to release upon order of
 16 27 a court in a proceeding under Code chapter 232.
 16 28    EXISTING CONFIDENTIALITY EXEMPTIONS.  The bill retains
 16 29 certain existing exemptions to confidentiality of juvenile
 16 30 court records. Pursuant to Code section 692A.121(8), records
 16 31 concerning sex offense convictions which are committed by
 16 32 minors may be released in the same manner as records of
 16 33 convictions of adults. Pursuant to Code section 915.10A,
 16 34 information concerning a juvenile charged with a felony offense
 16 35 may be released pursuant to an automated victim notification
 17  1 system. Under the bill, these exemptions to confidentiality
 17  2 are not amended and therefore still apply to juvenile court
 17  3 records.

 15  2 records in such a delinquency proceeding to be public records
 15  3 if the juvenile has been subsequently adjudicated delinquent
 15  4 for a public offense that would be a serious misdemeanor,
 15  5 aggravated misdemeanor, or felony offense if committed by an
 15  6 adult, or another delinquency proceeding is pending seeking
 15  7 such an adjudication. The bill provides that records subject
 15  8 to a public records order may be sealed at a later date
 15  9 pursuant to Code section 232.150.
 15 10    RIGHT TO REVIEW AND RELEASE A CONFIDENTIAL COMPLAINT.  The
 15 11 bill provides that delinquency complaints shall be released
 15 12 in accordance with Code section 915.25. Under current Code
 15 13 section 915.25, a complaint which alleges that a child who is
 15 14 at least 10 years of age committed a delinquent act, which if
 15 15 committed by an adult would be a public offense, is a public
 15 16 record. Current Code section 915.25 authorizes the court,
 15 17 its designee, or law enforcement officials to release such
 15 18 a complaint, including the identity of the child. The bill
 15 19 amends Code section 915.25 to provide that such a complaint
 15 20 is confidential unless the complaint alleges that the child
 15 21 committed a delinquent act that if committed by an adult would
 15 22 be a forcible felony. However, the bill authorizes state and
 15 23 local enforcement officials to release a confidential complaint
 15 24 against a child if the child is at large and doing so is deemed
 15 25 necessary for the protection of the public or the safety of
 15 26 the child. If the complaint is not confidential because the
 15 27 alleged delinquent act is an act that would be a forcible
 15 28 felony if committed by an adult, the court, its designee,
 15 29 or law enforcement officials may release such a complaint,
 15 30 including the identity of the child.
 15 31    The bill provides that an intake or juvenile court officer
 15 32 shall disclose to the alleged victim of a delinquent act, upon
 15 33 request, the complaint, the name and address of the child who
 15 34 allegedly committed the delinquent act, and the disposition
 15 35 of the complaint. If the alleged delinquent act would be
 16  1 a forcible felony if committed by an adult, the intake or
 16  2 juvenile court officer shall provide notification to the victim
 16  3 as required by Code section 915.24.
 16  4    SEALING OF JUVENILE COURT RECORDS UNAVAILABLE FOR
 16  5 OPERATING=WHILE=INTOXICATED VIOLATIONS.  Under current Code
 16  6 section 232.150, a court shall order juvenile court records
 16  7 to be sealed if the person who is the subject of the juvenile
 16  8 court records is 18 years of age or older and 2 years have
 16  9 elapsed since the last official action in the person's case,
 16 10 the person has not been subsequently convicted of a felony
 16 11 or an aggravated or serious misdemeanor or adjudicated a
 16 12 delinquent child for an act which if committed by an adult
 16 13 would be a felony, an aggravated misdemeanor, or a serious
 16 14 misdemeanor and no proceeding is pending seeking such
 16 15 conviction or adjudication, and the person was not placed on
 16 16 youthful offender status, transferred back to district court
 16 17 after the youthful offender's 18th birthday, and sentenced for
 16 18 the offense which precipitated the youthful offender placement.
 16 19 The bill in newly designated Code section 232.150(4) provides
 16 20 that the court shall not seal a person's juvenile court records
 16 21 if the person was adjudicated delinquent for violating Code
 16 22 section 321J.2, which prohibits the operation of a motor
 16 23 vehicle while under the influence of alcohol or a drug.

 16 25 public record which is confidential under the provisions of
 16 26 Code chapter 232 shall only be subject to release upon order of
 16 27 a court in a proceeding under Code chapter 232.
 16 28    EXISTING CONFIDENTIALITY EXEMPTIONS.  The bill retains
 16 29 certain existing exemptions to confidentiality of juvenile
 16 30 court records. Pursuant to Code section 692A.121(8), records
 16 31 concerning sex offense convictions which are committed by
 16 32 minors may be released in the same manner as records of

 16 34 information concerning a juvenile charged with a felony offense
 16 35 may be released pursuant to an automated victim notification

 17  2 are not amended and therefore still apply to juvenile court
 17  3 records.
 17  4    RIGHT TO COUNSEL.  The bill in Code section 232.11 provides
 17  5 that a child has the right to be represented by counsel at a
 17  6 hearing on a confidentiality order under Code section 232.149A
 17  7 or a public records order under Code section 232.149B.

 15  2 records in such a delinquency proceeding to be public records
 15  3 if the juvenile has been subsequently adjudicated delinquent
 15  4 for a public offense that would be a serious misdemeanor,
 15  5 aggravated misdemeanor, or felony offense if committed by an
 15  6 adult, or another delinquency proceeding is pending seeking
 15  7 such an adjudication. The bill provides that records subject

 15  9 pursuant to Code section 232.150.
 15 10    RIGHT TO REVIEW AND RELEASE A CONFIDENTIAL COMPLAINT.  The
 15 11 bill provides that delinquency complaints shall be released
 15 12 in accordance with Code section 915.25. Under current Code
 15 13 section 915.25, a complaint which alleges that a child who is
 15 14 at least 10 years of age committed a delinquent act, which if
 15 15 committed by an adult would be a public offense, is a public
 15 16 record. Current Code section 915.25 authorizes the court,
 15 17 its designee, or law enforcement officials to release such
 15 18 a complaint, including the identity of the child. The bill
 15 19 amends Code section 915.25 to provide that such a complaint
 15 20 is confidential unless the complaint alleges that the child
 15 21 committed a delinquent act that if committed by an adult would
 15 22 be a forcible felony. However, the bill authorizes state and
 15 23 local enforcement officials to release a confidential complaint
 15 24 against a child if the child is at large and doing so is deemed
 15 25 necessary for the protection of the public or the safety of
 15 26 the child. If the complaint is not confidential because the
 15 27 alleged delinquent act is an act that would be a forcible
 15 28 felony if committed by an adult, the court, its designee,
 15 29 or law enforcement officials may release such a complaint,
 15 30 including the identity of the child.
 15 31    The bill provides that an intake or juvenile court officer
 15 32 shall disclose to the alleged victim of a delinquent act, upon
 15 33 request, the complaint, the name and address of the child who
 15 34 allegedly committed the delinquent act, and the disposition
 15 35 of the complaint. If the alleged delinquent act would be
 16  1 a forcible felony if committed by an adult, the intake or
 16  2 juvenile court officer shall provide notification to the victim
 16  3 as required by Code section 915.24.
 16  4    SEALING OF JUVENILE COURT RECORDS UNAVAILABLE FOR
 16  5 OPERATING=WHILE=INTOXICATED VIOLATIONS.  Under current Code
 16  6 section 232.150, a court shall order juvenile court records
 16  7 to be sealed if the person who is the subject of the juvenile
 16  8 court records is 18 years of age or older and 2 years have
 16  9 elapsed since the last official action in the person's case,
 16 10 the person has not been subsequently convicted of a felony

 16 16 youthful offender status, transferred back to district court
 16 17 after the youthful offender's 18th birthday, and sentenced for
 16 18 the offense which precipitated the youthful offender placement.
 16 19 The bill in newly designated Code section 232.150(4) provides
 16 20 that the court shall not seal a person's juvenile court records

 16  8 court records is 18 years of age or older and 2 years have
 16  9 elapsed since the last official action in the person's case,
 16 10 the person has not been subsequently convicted of a felony
 16 11 or an aggravated or serious misdemeanor or adjudicated a
 16 12 delinquent child for an act which if committed by an adult
 16 13 would be a felony, an aggravated misdemeanor, or a serious

 16 16 youthful offender status, transferred back to district court
 16 17 after the youthful offender's 18th birthday, and sentenced for
 16 18 the offense which precipitated the youthful offender placement.
 16 19 The bill in newly designated Code section 232.150(4) provides
 16 20 that the court shall not seal a person's juvenile court records

 16 31 concerning sex offense convictions which are committed by

 16 34 information concerning a juvenile charged with a felony offense

 15 10    RIGHT TO REVIEW AND RELEASE A CONFIDENTIAL COMPLAINT.  The
 15 11 bill provides that delinquency complaints shall be released
 15 12 in accordance with Code section 915.25. Under current Code
 15 13 section 915.25, a complaint which alleges that a child who is
 15 14 at least 10 years of age committed a delinquent act, which if
 15 15 committed by an adult would be a public offense, is a public
 15 16 record. Current Code section 915.25 authorizes the court,
 15 17 its designee, or law enforcement officials to release such
 15 18 a complaint, including the identity of the child. The bill
 15 19 amends Code section 915.25 to provide that such a complaint
 15 20 is confidential unless the complaint alleges that the child
 15 21 committed a delinquent act that if committed by an adult would
 15 22 be a forcible felony. However, the bill authorizes state and
 15 23 local enforcement officials to release a confidential complaint
 15 24 against a child if the child is at large and doing so is deemed
 15 25 necessary for the protection of the public or the safety of
 15 26 the child. If the complaint is not confidential because the
 15 27 alleged delinquent act is an act that would be a forcible
 15 28 felony if committed by an adult, the court, its designee,
 15 29 or law enforcement officials may release such a complaint,
 15 30 including the identity of the child.
 15 31    The bill provides that an intake or juvenile court officer
 15 32 shall disclose to the alleged victim of a delinquent act, upon
 15 33 request, the complaint, the name and address of the child who
 15 34 allegedly committed the delinquent act, and the disposition
 15 35 of the complaint. If the alleged delinquent act would be
 16  1 a forcible felony if committed by an adult, the intake or
 16  2 juvenile court officer shall provide notification to the victim
 16  3 as required by Code section 915.24.
 16  4    SEALING OF JUVENILE COURT RECORDS UNAVAILABLE FOR

 16  7 to be sealed if the person who is the subject of the juvenile
 16  8 court records is 18 years of age or older and 2 years have
 16  9 elapsed since the last official action in the person's case,
 16 10 the person has not been subsequently convicted of a felony
 16 11 or an aggravated or serious misdemeanor or adjudicated a
 16 12 delinquent child for an act which if committed by an adult
 16 13 would be a felony, an aggravated misdemeanor, or a serious
 16 14 misdemeanor and no proceeding is pending seeking such

 16 18 the offense which precipitated the youthful offender placement.

 15 10    RIGHT TO REVIEW AND RELEASE A CONFIDENTIAL COMPLAINT.  The
 15 11 bill provides that delinquency complaints shall be released
 15 12 in accordance with Code section 915.25. Under current Code
 15 13 section 915.25, a complaint which alleges that a child who is
 15 14 at least 10 years of age committed a delinquent act, which if
 15 15 committed by an adult would be a public offense, is a public
 15 16 record. Current Code section 915.25 authorizes the court,
 15 17 its designee, or law enforcement officials to release such
 15 18 a complaint, including the identity of the child. The bill
 15 19 amends Code section 915.25 to provide that such a complaint
 15 20 is confidential unless the complaint alleges that the child
 15 21 committed a delinquent act that if committed by an adult would
 15 22 be a forcible felony. However, the bill authorizes state and
 15 23 local enforcement officials to release a confidential complaint
 15 24 against a child if the child is at large and doing so is deemed
 15 25 necessary for the protection of the public or the safety of
 15 26 the child. If the complaint is not confidential because the
 15 27 alleged delinquent act is an act that would be a forcible
 15 28 felony if committed by an adult, the court, its designee,
 15 29 or law enforcement officials may release such a complaint,
 15 30 including the identity of the child.
 15 31    The bill provides that an intake or juvenile court officer
 15 32 shall disclose to the alleged victim of a delinquent act, upon
 15 33 request, the complaint, the name and address of the child who
 15 34 allegedly committed the delinquent act, and the disposition
 15 35 of the complaint. If the alleged delinquent act would be
 16  1 a forcible felony if committed by an adult, the intake or
 16  2 juvenile court officer shall provide notification to the victim
 16  3 as required by Code section 915.24.
 16  4    SEALING OF JUVENILE COURT RECORDS UNAVAILABLE FOR
 16  5 OPERATING=WHILE=INTOXICATED VIOLATIONS.  Under current Code
 16  6 section 232.150, a court shall order juvenile court records
 16  7 to be sealed if the person who is the subject of the juvenile
 16  8 court records is 18 years of age or older and 2 years have
 16  9 elapsed since the last official action in the person's case,
 16 10 the person has not been subsequently convicted of a felony
 16 11 or an aggravated or serious misdemeanor or adjudicated a
 16 12 delinquent child for an act which if committed by an adult
 16 13 would be a felony, an aggravated misdemeanor, or a serious
 16 14 misdemeanor and no proceeding is pending seeking such
 16 15 conviction or adjudication, and the person was not placed on
 16 16 youthful offender status, transferred back to district court
 16 17 after the youthful offender's 18th birthday, and sentenced for
 16 18 the offense which precipitated the youthful offender placement.
 16 19 The bill in newly designated Code section 232.150(4) provides
 16 20 that the court shall not seal a person's juvenile court records
 16 21 if the person was adjudicated delinquent for violating Code
 16 22 section 321J.2, which prohibits the operation of a motor
