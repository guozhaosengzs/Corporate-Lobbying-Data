  1  3 the subparagraphs.
  1  4    Sec. 2.  EFFECTIVE UPON ENACTMENT.  This Act, being deemed of
  1  5 immediate importance, takes effect upon enactment.
  1  6                           EXPLANATION
  1  7 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  1  8 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  1  9    Current law requires that the state board of education
  1 10 provide in rule for a set of core academic indicators in
  1 11 mathematics and reading in grades 4, 8, and 11, and for science
  1 12 in grades 8 and 11, and that the Iowa assessments, used by
  1 13 school districts in the school year beginning July 1, 2011, be
  1 14 used for this purpose.
  1 15    This bill strikes a requirement that the state board's rules
  1 16 provide that for the school year beginning July 1, 2016, and
  1 17 each succeeding school year, all students enrolled in school
  1 18 districts in grades 3 through 11 shall be administered an
  1 19 assessment during the last quarter of the school year that
  1 20 assesses student progress on the core academic indicators.
  1 21 The provision also requires that the assessment used after
  1 22 July 1, 2016, at a minimum be aligned with the Iowa common
  1 23 core standards in both content and rigor; accurately describe
  1 24 student achievement and growth for purposes of the school, the
  1 25 school district, and state accountability systems; and provide
  1 26 valid, reliable, and fair measures of student progress toward
  1 27 college or career readiness.
  1 28    The bill also strikes a Code provision that requires the
  1 29 director of the department of education to establish an
  1 30 assessment task force to review and make recommendations
  1 31 for a statewide assessment of student progress on the core
  1 32 academic indicators.  The Iowa assessment task force submitted
  1 33 its findings and recommendations in a report to the general
  1 34 assembly on December 31, 2014.
  1 35    The bill takes effect upon enactment.

  1  7 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  1  8 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  1  9    Current law requires that the state board of education
  1 10 provide in rule for a set of core academic indicators in
  1 11 mathematics and reading in grades 4, 8, and 11, and for science
  1 12 in grades 8 and 11, and that the Iowa assessments, used by
  1 13 school districts in the school year beginning July 1, 2011, be
  1 14 used for this purpose.
  1 15    This bill strikes a requirement that the state board's rules
  1 16 provide that for the school year beginning July 1, 2016, and
  1 17 each succeeding school year, all students enrolled in school
  1 18 districts in grades 3 through 11 shall be administered an
  1 19 assessment during the last quarter of the school year that
  1 20 assesses student progress on the core academic indicators.
  1 21 The provision also requires that the assessment used after
  1 22 July 1, 2016, at a minimum be aligned with the Iowa common
  1 23 core standards in both content and rigor; accurately describe
  1 24 student achievement and growth for purposes of the school, the
  1 25 school district, and state accountability systems; and provide
  1 26 valid, reliable, and fair measures of student progress toward
  1 27 college or career readiness.
  1 28    The bill also strikes a Code provision that requires the
  1 29 director of the department of education to establish an
  1 30 assessment task force to review and make recommendations
  1 31 for a statewide assessment of student progress on the core
  1 32 academic indicators.  The Iowa assessment task force submitted
  1 33 its findings and recommendations in a report to the general
  1 34 assembly on December 31, 2014.
