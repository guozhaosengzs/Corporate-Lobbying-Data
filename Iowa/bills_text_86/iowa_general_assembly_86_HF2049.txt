 14 34                           EXPLANATION
 14 35 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
 15  1 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
 15  2    This bill relates to controlled substances, including by
 15  3 enhancing the penalties for imitation controlled substances,
 15  4 modifying the controlled substances listed in schedules I,
 15  5 III, IV, and temporarily designating substances as controlled
 15  6 substances.
 15  7    TEMPORARY CONTROLLED SUBSTANCE DESIGNATION.  Under current
 15  8 law and in the bill, the board of pharmacy may designate a new
 15  9 substance as a controlled substance, by administrative rule,
 15 10 without the general assembly amending Code chapter 124, only
 15 11 if the substance is designated as a controlled substance under
 15 12 federal law.
 15 13    If the board of pharmacy designates a substance as
 15 14 controlled, the bill specifies that the temporary designation
 15 15 is considered a temporary amendment to the schedules of
 15 16 controlled substances in Code chapter 124, and if the general
 15 17 assembly does not amend Code chapter 124 to enact the  temporary
 15 18 amendment and make the enactment effective within two years
 15 19 from the date the temporary amendment first became effective,
 15 20 the temporary amendment is repealed by operation of law two
 15 21 years from the effective date of the temporary amendment.  A
 15 22 temporary amendment repealed by operation of law is subject to
 15 23 Code section 4.13 relating to the construction of statutes and
 15 24 the application of a general savings provision.
 15 25    Current law provides that if within 60 days after the next
 15 26 general assembly convenes the general assembly has not made
 15 27 the corresponding changes in Code chapter 124, the temporary
 15 28 designation that the substance is a controlled substance is
 15 29 nullified.
 15 30    COCAINE BASE.  The bill increases the amounts of controlled
 15 31 substances containing cocaine base (crack cocaine) that
 15 32 determine the criminal penalty for certain offenses.  Under
 15 33 the bill, if a person unlawfully manufactures, delivers, or
 15 34 possesses with the intent to deliver a controlled substance
 15 35 containing cocaine base, or unlawfully acts with, enters into
 16  1 a common scheme or design with, or conspires with one or more
 16  2 persons to manufacture, deliver, or possess such a controlled
 16  3 substance, the person commits the following offenses: a class
 16  4 "B" felony punishable by confinement of no more than 50 years
 16  5 and a fine of not more than $1 million if the controlled
 16  6 substance containing cocaine base is more than 125 grams rather
 16  7 than the current 50 grams; a class "B" felony punishable by
 16  8 confinement of no more than 25 years and a fine of not less than
 16  9 $5,000 but not more than $100,000 if the imitation controlled
 16 10 substance is more than 35 grams but not more than 125 grams
 16 11 rather than the current 10 to 50 grams; or a class "C" felony
 16 12 punishable by a fine of not less than $1,000 but not more than
 16 13 $50,000 if the controlled substance containing cocaine base is
 16 14 35 grams or less rather than the current 10 grams or less.
 16 15    IMITATION CONTROLLED SUBSTANCES.  Under current law
 16 16 imitation controlled substances are regulated under Code
 16 17 chapter 124A.  The bill repeals Code chapter 124A and transfers
 16 18 the regulation of imitation controlled substances to Code
 16 19 chapter 124.  The definition and designation of an imitation
 16 20 controlled substance in Code chapter 124 remains identical
 16 21 to the definition and designation of an imitation controlled
 16 22 substance under current law in Code chapter 124A.
 16 23    Under the bill and in current law, an imitation controlled
 16 24 substance means a substance which is not a controlled substance
 16 25 but by color, shape, size, markings, and other aspects of
 16 26 dosage unit appearance, and packaging or other factors, appears
 16 27 to be or resembles a controlled substance. The board of
 16 28 pharmacy may designate a substance as an imitation controlled
 16 29 substance pursuant to the board's rulemaking authority and in
 16 30 accordance with Code chapter 17A.
 16 31    In addition, under current law and in the bill, if a
 16 32 substance has not been designated as an imitation controlled
 16 33 substance by the board of pharmacy and when dosage unit
 16 34 appearance alone does not establish that a substance is an
 16 35 imitation controlled substance, the following factors may
 17  1 be considered in determining whether the substance is an
 17  2 imitation controlled substance: the substance is represented
 17  3 as having the effect of a controlled substance; the substance
 17  4 is represented as a controlled substance or as a substitute for
 17  5 a controlled substance because of its nature or appearance;
 17  6 or a person receives money or other property having a value
 17  7 substantially greater than the actual value of the substance
 17  8 when sold.
 17  9    Under the bill, if a person unlawfully manufactures,
 17 10 delivers, or possesses with the intent to deliver an imitation
 17 11 controlled substance containing any detectable amount of those
 17 12 substances identified in Code section 124.204(9), or unlawfully
 17 13 acts with, enters into a common scheme or design with, or
 17 14 conspires with one or more persons to manufacture, deliver,
 17 15 or possess such imitation controlled substances, the person
 17 16 commits the following offense: a class "B" felony punishable
 17 17 by confinement of no more than 50 years and a fine of not more
 17 18 than $1 million if the imitation controlled substance is more
 17 19 than 10 kilograms; a class "B" felony punishable by confinement
 17 20 of no more than 25 years and a fine of not less than $5,000 but
 17 21 not more than $100,000 if the imitation controlled substance
 17 22 is more than five kilograms but not more than 10 kilograms; a
 17 23 class "C" felony punishable by a fine of not less than $1,000
 17 24 but not more than $50,000 if the imitation controlled substance
 17 25 is five kilograms or less; or an aggravated misdemeanor if the
 17 26 imitation controlled substance is classified in schedule IV or
 17 27 V; or a serious misdemeanor for a first possession offense,
 17 28 an aggravated misdemeanor for a second possession offense,
 17 29 or a class "D" felony for two or more previous possession
 17 30 offenses. Current law in Code section 124A.4 provides that if
 17 31 a person unlawfully manufactures, delivers, or possesses with
 17 32 intent to deliver an imitation controlled substance, the person
 17 33 commits an aggravated misdemeanor, or if the person delivers
 17 34 to a person under 18 years of age who is at least three years
 17 35 younger than the violator, the person commits a class "D"
 18  1 felony.  In addition, under current law, if a person unlawfully
 18  2 and knowingly publishes an advertisement or distributes in a
 18  3 public place a promotion for an imitation controlled substance
 18  4 the person commits a serious misdemeanor.
 18  5    The bill enhances the criminal penalties for controlled
 18  6 substances classified in Code sections 124.204(4)(ai) and
 18  7 124.204(6)(i) from an aggravated misdemeanor to a class "C"
 18  8 felony punishable pursuant to Code section 124.401(1)(c)(8).
 18  9 This change equalizes the criminal penalties with violations
 18 10 involving other schedule I controlled substances.
 18 11    The bill provides that if the same person commits two or
 18 12 more acts which are in violation of Code section 124.401(1)
 18 13 and the acts occur in the same location or time period so the
 18 14 acts are attributable to a single scheme, the acts may be
 18 15 considered a single violation and the weights of the imitation
 18 16 controlled substance may be combined for purposes of charging
 18 17 the offender.
 18 18    The amendment to Code section 124.401A provides that
 18 19 a person who is 18 years of age or older who unlawfully
 18 20 manufactures with the intent to distribute, distributes,
 18 21 or possesses with the intent to distribute an imitation
 18 22 controlled substance to another person 18 years of age or older
 18 23 within 1,000 feet of the real property comprising a public or
 18 24 nonpublic school, may be sentenced up to an additional term of
 18 25 confinement of five years in addition to any other penalty.
 18 26    The amendment to Code section 124.401B provides that
 18 27 a person who unlawfully possesses an imitation controlled
 18 28 substance within 1,000 feet of the real property comprising a
 18 29 school, public park, public pool, public recreation center, or
 18 30 marked school bus may be sentenced up to 100 hours of community
 18 31 service.
 18 32    The amendments to Code section 124.406 relate to the
 18 33 distribution or possession with the intent to distribute an
 18 34 imitation controlled substance to a person under 18 years of
 18 35 age.  A person who distributes or possesses with the intent to
 19  1 distribute an imitation controlled substance, represented to
 19  2 be a substance listed in schedule I or schedule II, to a person
 19  3 under 18 years of age commits a class "B" felony. The required
 19  4 penalty for such a violation is a minimum term of confinement
 19  5 of 10 years if the substance was distributed within 1,000
 19  6 feet of the real property comprising a public or nonpublic
 19  7 school, public park, public pool, or public recreation center.
 19  8 A person who distributes or possesses with the intent to
 19  9 distribute an imitation controlled substance, represented to be
 19 10 a substance listed in schedule III, to a person under 18 years
 19 11 of age, who is at least three years younger than the violator,
 19 12 commits a class "C" felony.  A person who distributes or
 19 13 possesses with the intent to distribute an imitation controlled
 19 14 substance, represented to be a substance listed in schedule
 19 15 IV or schedule V, to a person under 18 years of age, who is
 19 16 at least three years younger than the violator, commits an
 19 17 aggravated misdemeanor.
 19 18    The amendment to Code section 124.415 requires that a peace
 19 19 officer make a reasonable effort to identify a person under 18
 19 20 years of age discovered to be in possession of an imitation
 19 21 controlled substance, and if the person is not referred to
 19 22 juvenile court, the peace officer shall make a reasonable
 19 23 effort to notify the person's custodial parent of the
 19 24 possession unless the officer has reasonable grounds to believe
 19 25 such notification is not in the best interests of the person.
 19 26 The bill specifies that if the person is taken into custody
 19 27 the juvenile court officer shall make a reasonable effort to
 19 28 identify the school of attendance and to notify the school or
 19 29 nonpublic school of the taking into custody of the person.
 19 30    The bill creates Code section 124.417, which is similar to
 19 31 Code section 124A.5 repealed by the bill.  A person registered
 19 32 under Code section 124.302 does not violate the bill if the
 19 33 person manufactures, delivers, possesses, or possesses with the
 19 34 intent to manufacture or deliver, or acts with others to do
 19 35 such activities, if the person uses the imitation controlled
 20  1 substance for use as a placebo by a registered practitioner in
 20  2 the court of professional practice or research.
 20  3    SCHEDULE I, III, AND IV CONTROLLED SUBSTANCES.  The bill
 20  4 transfers numerous substances classified as "hallucinogenic
 20  5 substances" under schedule I and reclassifies the substances
 20  6 as "other substances" under schedule I.  By transferring the
 20  7 substances to "other substances", a person commits a class "C"
 20  8 felony under Code section 124.401(1)(c)(8) if the violation
 20  9 involves such a substance. Under current law, a person commits
 20 10 an aggravated misdemeanor under Code section 124.401(1)(d) when
 20 11 committing such violations.
 20 12    The bill adds new substances as "hallucinogenic substances"
 20 13 under schedule I.  A person commits a class "C" felony under
 20 14 Code section 124.401(1)(c)(8) if the violation involves the new
 20 15 hallucinogenic substances.
 20 16    The bill adds new substances as "stimulants" under schedule
 20 17 I.  A person commits a class "C" felony under Code section
 20 18 124.401(1)(c)(8) if the violation involves the new stimulant
 20 19 substances.
 20 20    The bill also adds new substances to the classification of
 20 21 "other substances" under schedule I.  A person commits a class
 20 22 "C" felony under Code section 124.401(1)(c)(8) for a violation
 20 23 involving the new substances.
 20 24    The bill strikes one substance classified as a
 20 25 "hallucinogenic substance" under schedule I and reclassifies
 20 26 the substance as a "stimulant" containing a synthetic cathinone
 20 27 under schedule I.  The transfer of the substance within
 20 28 schedule I also changes the criminal penalty for a violation
 20 29 involving the substance from a class "C" felony under Code
 20 30 section 124.401(1)(c)(8) to an aggravated misdemeanor under
 20 31 Code section 124.401(1)(d).  The bill also strikes a substance
 20 32 in Code section 124.204(6)(i)(3) from schedule I and does not
 20 33 reclassify the substance in any other substance schedule.
 20 34    The bill also removes numerous substances from schedule I
 20 35 which are currently classified as "stimulants" in Code section
 21  1 124.204(6)(i).
 21  2    The bill also strikes two narcotic substances from schedule
 21  3 III and adds three substances to schedule IV.  A violation
 21  4 involving a schedule IV controlled substance is punishable as
 21  5 an aggravated misdemeanor in Code section 124.401(1)(d).

 14 33    Sec. 41.  REPEAL.  Chapter 124A, Code 2016, is repealed.
 14 34                           EXPLANATION
 14 35 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
 15  1 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
 15  2    This bill relates to controlled substances, including by
 15  3 enhancing the penalties for imitation controlled substances,
 15  4 modifying the controlled substances listed in schedules I,
 15  5 III, IV, and temporarily designating substances as controlled
 15  6 substances.
 15  7    TEMPORARY CONTROLLED SUBSTANCE DESIGNATION.  Under current
 15  8 law and in the bill, the board of pharmacy may designate a new
 15  9 substance as a controlled substance, by administrative rule,
 15 10 without the general assembly amending Code chapter 124, only
 15 11 if the substance is designated as a controlled substance under
 15 12 federal law.
 15 13    If the board of pharmacy designates a substance as
 15 14 controlled, the bill specifies that the temporary designation
 15 15 is considered a temporary amendment to the schedules of
 15 16 controlled substances in Code chapter 124, and if the general
 15 17 assembly does not amend Code chapter 124 to enact the  temporary
 15 18 amendment and make the enactment effective within two years
 15 19 from the date the temporary amendment first became effective,
 15 20 the temporary amendment is repealed by operation of law two
 15 21 years from the effective date of the temporary amendment.  A
 15 22 temporary amendment repealed by operation of law is subject to
 15 23 Code section 4.13 relating to the construction of statutes and
 15 24 the application of a general savings provision.
 15 25    Current law provides that if within 60 days after the next
 15 26 general assembly convenes the general assembly has not made
 15 27 the corresponding changes in Code chapter 124, the temporary
 15 28 designation that the substance is a controlled substance is
 15 29 nullified.
 15 30    COCAINE BASE.  The bill increases the amounts of controlled
 15 31 substances containing cocaine base (crack cocaine) that
 15 32 determine the criminal penalty for certain offenses.  Under
 15 33 the bill, if a person unlawfully manufactures, delivers, or
 15 34 possesses with the intent to deliver a controlled substance
 15 35 containing cocaine base, or unlawfully acts with, enters into
 16  1 a common scheme or design with, or conspires with one or more
 16  2 persons to manufacture, deliver, or possess such a controlled
 16  3 substance, the person commits the following offenses: a class
 16  4 "B" felony punishable by confinement of no more than 50 years
 16  5 and a fine of not more than $1 million if the controlled
 16  6 substance containing cocaine base is more than 125 grams rather
 16  7 than the current 50 grams; a class "B" felony punishable by
 16  8 confinement of no more than 25 years and a fine of not less than
 16  9 $5,000 but not more than $100,000 if the imitation controlled
 16 10 substance is more than 35 grams but not more than 125 grams
 16 11 rather than the current 10 to 50 grams; or a class "C" felony
 16 12 punishable by a fine of not less than $1,000 but not more than
 16 13 $50,000 if the controlled substance containing cocaine base is
 16 14 35 grams or less rather than the current 10 grams or less.
 16 15    IMITATION CONTROLLED SUBSTANCES.  Under current law
 16 16 imitation controlled substances are regulated under Code
 16 17 chapter 124A.  The bill repeals Code chapter 124A and transfers
 16 18 the regulation of imitation controlled substances to Code
 16 19 chapter 124.  The definition and designation of an imitation
 16 20 controlled substance in Code chapter 124 remains identical
 16 21 to the definition and designation of an imitation controlled
 16 22 substance under current law in Code chapter 124A.
 16 23    Under the bill and in current law, an imitation controlled
 16 24 substance means a substance which is not a controlled substance
 16 25 but by color, shape, size, markings, and other aspects of
 16 26 dosage unit appearance, and packaging or other factors, appears
 16 27 to be or resembles a controlled substance. The board of
 16 28 pharmacy may designate a substance as an imitation controlled
 16 29 substance pursuant to the board's rulemaking authority and in
 16 30 accordance with Code chapter 17A.
 16 31    In addition, under current law and in the bill, if a
 16 32 substance has not been designated as an imitation controlled
 16 33 substance by the board of pharmacy and when dosage unit
 16 34 appearance alone does not establish that a substance is an
 16 35 imitation controlled substance, the following factors may
 17  1 be considered in determining whether the substance is an
 17  2 imitation controlled substance: the substance is represented
 17  3 as having the effect of a controlled substance; the substance
 17  4 is represented as a controlled substance or as a substitute for
 17  5 a controlled substance because of its nature or appearance;
 17  6 or a person receives money or other property having a value
 17  7 substantially greater than the actual value of the substance
 17  8 when sold.
 17  9    Under the bill, if a person unlawfully manufactures,
 17 10 delivers, or possesses with the intent to deliver an imitation
 17 11 controlled substance containing any detectable amount of those
 17 12 substances identified in Code section 124.204(9), or unlawfully
 17 13 acts with, enters into a common scheme or design with, or
 17 14 conspires with one or more persons to manufacture, deliver,
 17 15 or possess such imitation controlled substances, the person
 17 16 commits the following offense: a class "B" felony punishable
 17 17 by confinement of no more than 50 years and a fine of not more
 17 18 than $1 million if the imitation controlled substance is more
 17 19 than 10 kilograms; a class "B" felony punishable by confinement
 17 20 of no more than 25 years and a fine of not less than $5,000 but
 17 21 not more than $100,000 if the imitation controlled substance
 17 22 is more than five kilograms but not more than 10 kilograms; a
 17 23 class "C" felony punishable by a fine of not less than $1,000
 17 24 but not more than $50,000 if the imitation controlled substance
 17 25 is five kilograms or less; or an aggravated misdemeanor if the
 17 26 imitation controlled substance is classified in schedule IV or
 17 27 V; or a serious misdemeanor for a first possession offense,
 17 28 an aggravated misdemeanor for a second possession offense,
 17 29 or a class "D" felony for two or more previous possession
 17 30 offenses. Current law in Code section 124A.4 provides that if
 17 31 a person unlawfully manufactures, delivers, or possesses with
 17 32 intent to deliver an imitation controlled substance, the person
 17 33 commits an aggravated misdemeanor, or if the person delivers
 17 34 to a person under 18 years of age who is at least three years
 17 35 younger than the violator, the person commits a class "D"
 18  1 felony.  In addition, under current law, if a person unlawfully
 18  2 and knowingly publishes an advertisement or distributes in a
 18  3 public place a promotion for an imitation controlled substance
 18  4 the person commits a serious misdemeanor.
 18  5    The bill enhances the criminal penalties for controlled
 18  6 substances classified in Code sections 124.204(4)(ai) and
 18  7 124.204(6)(i) from an aggravated misdemeanor to a class "C"
 18  8 felony punishable pursuant to Code section 124.401(1)(c)(8).
 18  9 This change equalizes the criminal penalties with violations
 18 10 involving other schedule I controlled substances.
 18 11    The bill provides that if the same person commits two or
 18 12 more acts which are in violation of Code section 124.401(1)
 18 13 and the acts occur in the same location or time period so the
 18 14 acts are attributable to a single scheme, the acts may be
 18 15 considered a single violation and the weights of the imitation
 18 16 controlled substance may be combined for purposes of charging
 18 17 the offender.
 18 18    The amendment to Code section 124.401A provides that
 18 19 a person who is 18 years of age or older who unlawfully
 18 20 manufactures with the intent to distribute, distributes,
 18 21 or possesses with the intent to distribute an imitation
 18 22 controlled substance to another person 18 years of age or older
 18 23 within 1,000 feet of the real property comprising a public or
 18 24 nonpublic school, may be sentenced up to an additional term of
 18 25 confinement of five years in addition to any other penalty.
 18 26    The amendment to Code section 124.401B provides that
 18 27 a person who unlawfully possesses an imitation controlled
 18 28 substance within 1,000 feet of the real property comprising a
 18 29 school, public park, public pool, public recreation center, or
 18 30 marked school bus may be sentenced up to 100 hours of community
 18 31 service.
 18 32    The amendments to Code section 124.406 relate to the
 18 33 distribution or possession with the intent to distribute an
 18 34 imitation controlled substance to a person under 18 years of
 18 35 age.  A person who distributes or possesses with the intent to
 19  1 distribute an imitation controlled substance, represented to
 19  2 be a substance listed in schedule I or schedule II, to a person
 19  3 under 18 years of age commits a class "B" felony. The required
 19  4 penalty for such a violation is a minimum term of confinement
 19  5 of 10 years if the substance was distributed within 1,000
 19  6 feet of the real property comprising a public or nonpublic
 19  7 school, public park, public pool, or public recreation center.
 19  8 A person who distributes or possesses with the intent to
 19  9 distribute an imitation controlled substance, represented to be
 19 10 a substance listed in schedule III, to a person under 18 years
 19 11 of age, who is at least three years younger than the violator,
 19 12 commits a class "C" felony.  A person who distributes or
 19 13 possesses with the intent to distribute an imitation controlled
 19 14 substance, represented to be a substance listed in schedule
 19 15 IV or schedule V, to a person under 18 years of age, who is
 19 16 at least three years younger than the violator, commits an
 19 17 aggravated misdemeanor.
 19 18    The amendment to Code section 124.415 requires that a peace
 19 19 officer make a reasonable effort to identify a person under 18
 19 20 years of age discovered to be in possession of an imitation
 19 21 controlled substance, and if the person is not referred to
 19 22 juvenile court, the peace officer shall make a reasonable
 19 23 effort to notify the person's custodial parent of the
 19 24 possession unless the officer has reasonable grounds to believe
 19 25 such notification is not in the best interests of the person.
 19 26 The bill specifies that if the person is taken into custody
 19 27 the juvenile court officer shall make a reasonable effort to
 19 28 identify the school of attendance and to notify the school or
 19 29 nonpublic school of the taking into custody of the person.
 19 30    The bill creates Code section 124.417, which is similar to
 19 31 Code section 124A.5 repealed by the bill.  A person registered
 19 32 under Code section 124.302 does not violate the bill if the
 19 33 person manufactures, delivers, possesses, or possesses with the
 19 34 intent to manufacture or deliver, or acts with others to do
 19 35 such activities, if the person uses the imitation controlled
 20  1 substance for use as a placebo by a registered practitioner in
 20  2 the court of professional practice or research.
 20  3    SCHEDULE I, III, AND IV CONTROLLED SUBSTANCES.  The bill
 20  4 transfers numerous substances classified as "hallucinogenic
 20  5 substances" under schedule I and reclassifies the substances
 20  6 as "other substances" under schedule I.  By transferring the
 20  7 substances to "other substances", a person commits a class "C"
 20  8 felony under Code section 124.401(1)(c)(8) if the violation
 20  9 involves such a substance. Under current law, a person commits
 20 10 an aggravated misdemeanor under Code section 124.401(1)(d) when
 20 11 committing such violations.
 20 12    The bill adds new substances as "hallucinogenic substances"
 20 13 under schedule I.  A person commits a class "C" felony under
 20 14 Code section 124.401(1)(c)(8) if the violation involves the new
 20 15 hallucinogenic substances.
 20 16    The bill adds new substances as "stimulants" under schedule
 20 17 I.  A person commits a class "C" felony under Code section
 20 18 124.401(1)(c)(8) if the violation involves the new stimulant
 20 19 substances.
 20 20    The bill also adds new substances to the classification of
 20 21 "other substances" under schedule I.  A person commits a class
 20 22 "C" felony under Code section 124.401(1)(c)(8) for a violation
 20 23 involving the new substances.
 20 24    The bill strikes one substance classified as a
 20 25 "hallucinogenic substance" under schedule I and reclassifies
 20 26 the substance as a "stimulant" containing a synthetic cathinone
 20 27 under schedule I.  The transfer of the substance within
 20 28 schedule I also changes the criminal penalty for a violation
 20 29 involving the substance from a class "C" felony under Code
 20 30 section 124.401(1)(c)(8) to an aggravated misdemeanor under
 20 31 Code section 124.401(1)(d).  The bill also strikes a substance
 20 32 in Code section 124.204(6)(i)(3) from schedule I and does not
 20 33 reclassify the substance in any other substance schedule.
 20 34    The bill also removes numerous substances from schedule I
 20 35 which are currently classified as "stimulants" in Code section
 21  1 124.204(6)(i).
 21  2    The bill also strikes two narcotic substances from schedule
 21  3 III and adds three substances to schedule IV.  A violation
 21  4 involving a schedule IV controlled substance is punishable as
 21  5 an aggravated misdemeanor in Code section 124.401(1)(d).

 15  7    TEMPORARY CONTROLLED SUBSTANCE DESIGNATION.  Under current
 15  8 law and in the bill, the board of pharmacy may designate a new
 15  9 substance as a controlled substance, by administrative rule,
 15 10 without the general assembly amending Code chapter 124, only
 15 11 if the substance is designated as a controlled substance under
 15 12 federal law.
 15 13    If the board of pharmacy designates a substance as
 15 14 controlled, the bill specifies that the temporary designation
 15 15 is considered a temporary amendment to the schedules of
 15 16 controlled substances in Code chapter 124, and if the general
 15 17 assembly does not amend Code chapter 124 to enact the  temporary
 15 18 amendment and make the enactment effective within two years
 15 19 from the date the temporary amendment first became effective,
 15 20 the temporary amendment is repealed by operation of law two
 15 21 years from the effective date of the temporary amendment.  A
 15 22 temporary amendment repealed by operation of law is subject to
 15 23 Code section 4.13 relating to the construction of statutes and
 15 24 the application of a general savings provision.
 15 25    Current law provides that if within 60 days after the next
 15 26 general assembly convenes the general assembly has not made
 15 27 the corresponding changes in Code chapter 124, the temporary
 15 28 designation that the substance is a controlled substance is
 15 29 nullified.
 15 30    COCAINE BASE.  The bill increases the amounts of controlled
 15 31 substances containing cocaine base (crack cocaine) that
 15 32 determine the criminal penalty for certain offenses.  Under
 15 33 the bill, if a person unlawfully manufactures, delivers, or
 15 34 possesses with the intent to deliver a controlled substance
 15 35 containing cocaine base, or unlawfully acts with, enters into
 16  1 a common scheme or design with, or conspires with one or more
 16  2 persons to manufacture, deliver, or possess such a controlled
 16  3 substance, the person commits the following offenses: a class
 16  4 "B" felony punishable by confinement of no more than 50 years
 16  5 and a fine of not more than $1 million if the controlled
 16  6 substance containing cocaine base is more than 125 grams rather
 16  7 than the current 50 grams; a class "B" felony punishable by
 16  8 confinement of no more than 25 years and a fine of not less than
 16  9 $5,000 but not more than $100,000 if the imitation controlled
 16 10 substance is more than 35 grams but not more than 125 grams
 16 11 rather than the current 10 to 50 grams; or a class "C" felony
 16 12 punishable by a fine of not less than $1,000 but not more than
 16 13 $50,000 if the controlled substance containing cocaine base is
 16 14 35 grams or less rather than the current 10 grams or less.
 16 15    IMITATION CONTROLLED SUBSTANCES.  Under current law
 16 16 imitation controlled substances are regulated under Code
 16 17 chapter 124A.  The bill repeals Code chapter 124A and transfers
 16 18 the regulation of imitation controlled substances to Code
 16 19 chapter 124.  The definition and designation of an imitation
 16 20 controlled substance in Code chapter 124 remains identical
 16 21 to the definition and designation of an imitation controlled
 16 22 substance under current law in Code chapter 124A.
 16 23    Under the bill and in current law, an imitation controlled
 16 24 substance means a substance which is not a controlled substance
 16 25 but by color, shape, size, markings, and other aspects of
 16 26 dosage unit appearance, and packaging or other factors, appears
 16 27 to be or resembles a controlled substance. The board of
 16 28 pharmacy may designate a substance as an imitation controlled
 16 29 substance pursuant to the board's rulemaking authority and in
 16 30 accordance with Code chapter 17A.
 16 31    In addition, under current law and in the bill, if a
 16 32 substance has not been designated as an imitation controlled
 16 33 substance by the board of pharmacy and when dosage unit
 16 34 appearance alone does not establish that a substance is an
 16 35 imitation controlled substance, the following factors may
 17  1 be considered in determining whether the substance is an
 17  2 imitation controlled substance: the substance is represented
 17  3 as having the effect of a controlled substance; the substance
 17  4 is represented as a controlled substance or as a substitute for
 17  5 a controlled substance because of its nature or appearance;
 17  6 or a person receives money or other property having a value
 17  7 substantially greater than the actual value of the substance
 17  8 when sold.
 17  9    Under the bill, if a person unlawfully manufactures,
 17 10 delivers, or possesses with the intent to deliver an imitation
 17 11 controlled substance containing any detectable amount of those
 17 12 substances identified in Code section 124.204(9), or unlawfully
 17 13 acts with, enters into a common scheme or design with, or
 17 14 conspires with one or more persons to manufacture, deliver,
 17 15 or possess such imitation controlled substances, the person
 17 16 commits the following offense: a class "B" felony punishable
 17 17 by confinement of no more than 50 years and a fine of not more
 17 18 than $1 million if the imitation controlled substance is more
 17 19 than 10 kilograms; a class "B" felony punishable by confinement
 17 20 of no more than 25 years and a fine of not less than $5,000 but
 17 21 not more than $100,000 if the imitation controlled substance
 17 22 is more than five kilograms but not more than 10 kilograms; a
 17 23 class "C" felony punishable by a fine of not less than $1,000
 17 24 but not more than $50,000 if the imitation controlled substance
 17 25 is five kilograms or less; or an aggravated misdemeanor if the
 17 26 imitation controlled substance is classified in schedule IV or
 17 27 V; or a serious misdemeanor for a first possession offense,
 17 28 an aggravated misdemeanor for a second possession offense,
 17 29 or a class "D" felony for two or more previous possession
 17 30 offenses. Current law in Code section 124A.4 provides that if
 17 31 a person unlawfully manufactures, delivers, or possesses with
 17 32 intent to deliver an imitation controlled substance, the person
 17 33 commits an aggravated misdemeanor, or if the person delivers
 17 34 to a person under 18 years of age who is at least three years
 17 35 younger than the violator, the person commits a class "D"
 18  1 felony.  In addition, under current law, if a person unlawfully
 18  2 and knowingly publishes an advertisement or distributes in a
 18  3 public place a promotion for an imitation controlled substance
 18  4 the person commits a serious misdemeanor.
 18  5    The bill enhances the criminal penalties for controlled
 18  6 substances classified in Code sections 124.204(4)(ai) and
 18  7 124.204(6)(i) from an aggravated misdemeanor to a class "C"
 18  8 felony punishable pursuant to Code section 124.401(1)(c)(8).
 18  9 This change equalizes the criminal penalties with violations
 18 10 involving other schedule I controlled substances.
 18 11    The bill provides that if the same person commits two or
 18 12 more acts which are in violation of Code section 124.401(1)
 18 13 and the acts occur in the same location or time period so the
 18 14 acts are attributable to a single scheme, the acts may be
 18 15 considered a single violation and the weights of the imitation
 18 16 controlled substance may be combined for purposes of charging
 18 17 the offender.
 18 18    The amendment to Code section 124.401A provides that
 18 19 a person who is 18 years of age or older who unlawfully
 18 20 manufactures with the intent to distribute, distributes,
 18 21 or possesses with the intent to distribute an imitation
 18 22 controlled substance to another person 18 years of age or older
 18 23 within 1,000 feet of the real property comprising a public or
 18 24 nonpublic school, may be sentenced up to an additional term of
 18 25 confinement of five years in addition to any other penalty.
 18 26    The amendment to Code section 124.401B provides that
 18 27 a person who unlawfully possesses an imitation controlled
 18 28 substance within 1,000 feet of the real property comprising a
 18 29 school, public park, public pool, public recreation center, or
 18 30 marked school bus may be sentenced up to 100 hours of community
 18 31 service.
 18 32    The amendments to Code section 124.406 relate to the
 18 33 distribution or possession with the intent to distribute an
 18 34 imitation controlled substance to a person under 18 years of
 18 35 age.  A person who distributes or possesses with the intent to
 19  1 distribute an imitation controlled substance, represented to
 19  2 be a substance listed in schedule I or schedule II, to a person
 19  3 under 18 years of age commits a class "B" felony. The required
 19  4 penalty for such a violation is a minimum term of confinement
 19  5 of 10 years if the substance was distributed within 1,000
 19  6 feet of the real property comprising a public or nonpublic
 19  7 school, public park, public pool, or public recreation center.
 19  8 A person who distributes or possesses with the intent to
 19  9 distribute an imitation controlled substance, represented to be
 19 10 a substance listed in schedule III, to a person under 18 years
 19 11 of age, who is at least three years younger than the violator,
 19 12 commits a class "C" felony.  A person who distributes or
 19 13 possesses with the intent to distribute an imitation controlled
 19 14 substance, represented to be a substance listed in schedule
 19 15 IV or schedule V, to a person under 18 years of age, who is
 19 16 at least three years younger than the violator, commits an
 19 17 aggravated misdemeanor.
 19 18    The amendment to Code section 124.415 requires that a peace
 19 19 officer make a reasonable effort to identify a person under 18
 19 20 years of age discovered to be in possession of an imitation
 19 21 controlled substance, and if the person is not referred to
 19 22 juvenile court, the peace officer shall make a reasonable
 19 23 effort to notify the person's custodial parent of the
 19 24 possession unless the officer has reasonable grounds to believe
 19 25 such notification is not in the best interests of the person.
 19 26 The bill specifies that if the person is taken into custody
 19 27 the juvenile court officer shall make a reasonable effort to
 19 28 identify the school of attendance and to notify the school or
 19 29 nonpublic school of the taking into custody of the person.
 19 30    The bill creates Code section 124.417, which is similar to
 19 31 Code section 124A.5 repealed by the bill.  A person registered
 19 32 under Code section 124.302 does not violate the bill if the
 19 33 person manufactures, delivers, possesses, or possesses with the
 19 34 intent to manufacture or deliver, or acts with others to do
 19 35 such activities, if the person uses the imitation controlled
 20  1 substance for use as a placebo by a registered practitioner in
 20  2 the court of professional practice or research.
 20  3    SCHEDULE I, III, AND IV CONTROLLED SUBSTANCES.  The bill
 20  4 transfers numerous substances classified as "hallucinogenic
 20  5 substances" under schedule I and reclassifies the substances
 20  6 as "other substances" under schedule I.  By transferring the
 20  7 substances to "other substances", a person commits a class "C"
 20  8 felony under Code section 124.401(1)(c)(8) if the violation
 20  9 involves such a substance. Under current law, a person commits
 20 10 an aggravated misdemeanor under Code section 124.401(1)(d) when
 20 11 committing such violations.
 20 12    The bill adds new substances as "hallucinogenic substances"
 20 13 under schedule I.  A person commits a class "C" felony under
 20 14 Code section 124.401(1)(c)(8) if the violation involves the new
 20 15 hallucinogenic substances.
 20 16    The bill adds new substances as "stimulants" under schedule
 20 17 I.  A person commits a class "C" felony under Code section
 20 18 124.401(1)(c)(8) if the violation involves the new stimulant
 20 19 substances.
 20 20    The bill also adds new substances to the classification of
 20 21 "other substances" under schedule I.  A person commits a class
 20 22 "C" felony under Code section 124.401(1)(c)(8) for a violation
 20 23 involving the new substances.
 20 24    The bill strikes one substance classified as a
 20 25 "hallucinogenic substance" under schedule I and reclassifies
 20 26 the substance as a "stimulant" containing a synthetic cathinone
 20 27 under schedule I.  The transfer of the substance within
 20 28 schedule I also changes the criminal penalty for a violation
 20 29 involving the substance from a class "C" felony under Code
 20 30 section 124.401(1)(c)(8) to an aggravated misdemeanor under
 20 31 Code section 124.401(1)(d).  The bill also strikes a substance
 20 32 in Code section 124.204(6)(i)(3) from schedule I and does not
 20 33 reclassify the substance in any other substance schedule.
 20 34    The bill also removes numerous substances from schedule I
 20 35 which are currently classified as "stimulants" in Code section
 21  1 124.204(6)(i).
 21  2    The bill also strikes two narcotic substances from schedule
 21  3 III and adds three substances to schedule IV.  A violation
 21  4 involving a schedule IV controlled substance is punishable as
 21  5 an aggravated misdemeanor in Code section 124.401(1)(d).

 14 35 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
 15  1 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
 15  2    This bill relates to controlled substances, including by
 15  3 enhancing the penalties for imitation controlled substances,
 15  4 modifying the controlled substances listed in schedules I,
 15  5 III, IV, and temporarily designating substances as controlled
 15  6 substances.
 15  7    TEMPORARY CONTROLLED SUBSTANCE DESIGNATION.  Under current
 15  8 law and in the bill, the board of pharmacy may designate a new
 15  9 substance as a controlled substance, by administrative rule,
 15 10 without the general assembly amending Code chapter 124, only
 15 11 if the substance is designated as a controlled substance under
 15 12 federal law.
 15 13    If the board of pharmacy designates a substance as
 15 14 controlled, the bill specifies that the temporary designation
 15 15 is considered a temporary amendment to the schedules of
 15 16 controlled substances in Code chapter 124, and if the general
 15 17 assembly does not amend Code chapter 124 to enact the  temporary
 15 18 amendment and make the enactment effective within two years
 15 19 from the date the temporary amendment first became effective,
 15 20 the temporary amendment is repealed by operation of law two
 15 21 years from the effective date of the temporary amendment.  A
 15 22 temporary amendment repealed by operation of law is subject to
 15 23 Code section 4.13 relating to the construction of statutes and
 15 24 the application of a general savings provision.
 15 25    Current law provides that if within 60 days after the next
 15 26 general assembly convenes the general assembly has not made
 15 27 the corresponding changes in Code chapter 124, the temporary
 15 28 designation that the substance is a controlled substance is
 15 29 nullified.
 15 30    COCAINE BASE.  The bill increases the amounts of controlled
 15 31 substances containing cocaine base (crack cocaine) that
 15 32 determine the criminal penalty for certain offenses.  Under
 15 33 the bill, if a person unlawfully manufactures, delivers, or
 15 34 possesses with the intent to deliver a controlled substance
 15 35 containing cocaine base, or unlawfully acts with, enters into
 16  1 a common scheme or design with, or conspires with one or more
 16  2 persons to manufacture, deliver, or possess such a controlled
 16  3 substance, the person commits the following offenses: a class
 16  4 "B" felony punishable by confinement of no more than 50 years
 16  5 and a fine of not more than $1 million if the controlled
 16  6 substance containing cocaine base is more than 125 grams rather
 16  7 than the current 50 grams; a class "B" felony punishable by
 16  8 confinement of no more than 25 years and a fine of not less than
 16  9 $5,000 but not more than $100,000 if the imitation controlled
 16 10 substance is more than 35 grams but not more than 125 grams
 16 11 rather than the current 10 to 50 grams; or a class "C" felony
 16 12 punishable by a fine of not less than $1,000 but not more than
 16 13 $50,000 if the controlled substance containing cocaine base is
 16 14 35 grams or less rather than the current 10 grams or less.
 16 15    IMITATION CONTROLLED SUBSTANCES.  Under current law
 16 16 imitation controlled substances are regulated under Code
 16 17 chapter 124A.  The bill repeals Code chapter 124A and transfers
 16 18 the regulation of imitation controlled substances to Code
 16 19 chapter 124.  The definition and designation of an imitation
 16 20 controlled substance in Code chapter 124 remains identical
 16 21 to the definition and designation of an imitation controlled
 16 22 substance under current law in Code chapter 124A.
 16 23    Under the bill and in current law, an imitation controlled
 16 24 substance means a substance which is not a controlled substance
 16 25 but by color, shape, size, markings, and other aspects of
 16 26 dosage unit appearance, and packaging or other factors, appears
 16 27 to be or resembles a controlled substance. The board of
 16 28 pharmacy may designate a substance as an imitation controlled
 16 29 substance pursuant to the board's rulemaking authority and in
 16 30 accordance with Code chapter 17A.
 16 31    In addition, under current law and in the bill, if a
 16 32 substance has not been designated as an imitation controlled
 16 33 substance by the board of pharmacy and when dosage unit
 16 34 appearance alone does not establish that a substance is an
 16 35 imitation controlled substance, the following factors may
 17  1 be considered in determining whether the substance is an
 17  2 imitation controlled substance: the substance is represented
 17  3 as having the effect of a controlled substance; the substance
 17  4 is represented as a controlled substance or as a substitute for
 17  5 a controlled substance because of its nature or appearance;
 17  6 or a person receives money or other property having a value
 17  7 substantially greater than the actual value of the substance
 17  8 when sold.
 17  9    Under the bill, if a person unlawfully manufactures,
 17 10 delivers, or possesses with the intent to deliver an imitation
 17 11 controlled substance containing any detectable amount of those
 17 12 substances identified in Code section 124.204(9), or unlawfully
 17 13 acts with, enters into a common scheme or design with, or
 17 14 conspires with one or more persons to manufacture, deliver,
 17 15 or possess such imitation controlled substances, the person
 17 16 commits the following offense: a class "B" felony punishable
 17 17 by confinement of no more than 50 years and a fine of not more
 17 18 than $1 million if the imitation controlled substance is more
 17 19 than 10 kilograms; a class "B" felony punishable by confinement
 17 20 of no more than 25 years and a fine of not less than $5,000 but
 17 21 not more than $100,000 if the imitation controlled substance
 17 22 is more than five kilograms but not more than 10 kilograms; a
 17 23 class "C" felony punishable by a fine of not less than $1,000
 17 24 but not more than $50,000 if the imitation controlled substance
 17 25 is five kilograms or less; or an aggravated misdemeanor if the
 17 26 imitation controlled substance is classified in schedule IV or
 17 27 V; or a serious misdemeanor for a first possession offense,
 17 28 an aggravated misdemeanor for a second possession offense,
 17 29 or a class "D" felony for two or more previous possession
 17 30 offenses. Current law in Code section 124A.4 provides that if
 17 31 a person unlawfully manufactures, delivers, or possesses with
 17 32 intent to deliver an imitation controlled substance, the person
 17 33 commits an aggravated misdemeanor, or if the person delivers
 17 34 to a person under 18 years of age who is at least three years
 17 35 younger than the violator, the person commits a class "D"
 18  1 felony.  In addition, under current law, if a person unlawfully
 18  2 and knowingly publishes an advertisement or distributes in a
 18  3 public place a promotion for an imitation controlled substance
 18  4 the person commits a serious misdemeanor.
 18  5    The bill enhances the criminal penalties for controlled
 18  6 substances classified in Code sections 124.204(4)(ai) and
 18  7 124.204(6)(i) from an aggravated misdemeanor to a class "C"
 18  8 felony punishable pursuant to Code section 124.401(1)(c)(8).
 18  9 This change equalizes the criminal penalties with violations
 18 10 involving other schedule I controlled substances.
 18 11    The bill provides that if the same person commits two or
 18 12 more acts which are in violation of Code section 124.401(1)
 18 13 and the acts occur in the same location or time period so the
 18 14 acts are attributable to a single scheme, the acts may be
 18 15 considered a single violation and the weights of the imitation
 18 16 controlled substance may be combined for purposes of charging
 18 17 the offender.
 18 18    The amendment to Code section 124.401A provides that
 18 19 a person who is 18 years of age or older who unlawfully
 18 20 manufactures with the intent to distribute, distributes,
 18 21 or possesses with the intent to distribute an imitation
 18 22 controlled substance to another person 18 years of age or older
 18 23 within 1,000 feet of the real property comprising a public or
 18 24 nonpublic school, may be sentenced up to an additional term of
 18 25 confinement of five years in addition to any other penalty.
 18 26    The amendment to Code section 124.401B provides that
 18 27 a person who unlawfully possesses an imitation controlled
 18 28 substance within 1,000 feet of the real property comprising a
 18 29 school, public park, public pool, public recreation center, or
 18 30 marked school bus may be sentenced up to 100 hours of community
 18 31 service.
 18 32    The amendments to Code section 124.406 relate to the
 18 33 distribution or possession with the intent to distribute an
 18 34 imitation controlled substance to a person under 18 years of
 18 35 age.  A person who distributes or possesses with the intent to
 19  1 distribute an imitation controlled substance, represented to
 19  2 be a substance listed in schedule I or schedule II, to a person
 19  3 under 18 years of age commits a class "B" felony. The required
 19  4 penalty for such a violation is a minimum term of confinement
 19  5 of 10 years if the substance was distributed within 1,000
 19  6 feet of the real property comprising a public or nonpublic
 19  7 school, public park, public pool, or public recreation center.
 19  8 A person who distributes or possesses with the intent to
 19  9 distribute an imitation controlled substance, represented to be
 19 10 a substance listed in schedule III, to a person under 18 years
 19 11 of age, who is at least three years younger than the violator,
 19 12 commits a class "C" felony.  A person who distributes or
 19 13 possesses with the intent to distribute an imitation controlled
 19 14 substance, represented to be a substance listed in schedule
 19 15 IV or schedule V, to a person under 18 years of age, who is
 19 16 at least three years younger than the violator, commits an
 19 17 aggravated misdemeanor.
 19 18    The amendment to Code section 124.415 requires that a peace
 19 19 officer make a reasonable effort to identify a person under 18
 19 20 years of age discovered to be in possession of an imitation
 19 21 controlled substance, and if the person is not referred to
 19 22 juvenile court, the peace officer shall make a reasonable
 19 23 effort to notify the person's custodial parent of the
 19 24 possession unless the officer has reasonable grounds to believe
 19 25 such notification is not in the best interests of the person.
 19 26 The bill specifies that if the person is taken into custody
 19 27 the juvenile court officer shall make a reasonable effort to
 19 28 identify the school of attendance and to notify the school or
 19 29 nonpublic school of the taking into custody of the person.
 19 30    The bill creates Code section 124.417, which is similar to
 19 31 Code section 124A.5 repealed by the bill.  A person registered
 19 32 under Code section 124.302 does not violate the bill if the
 19 33 person manufactures, delivers, possesses, or possesses with the
 19 34 intent to manufacture or deliver, or acts with others to do
 19 35 such activities, if the person uses the imitation controlled
 20  1 substance for use as a placebo by a registered practitioner in
 20  2 the court of professional practice or research.
 20  3    SCHEDULE I, III, AND IV CONTROLLED SUBSTANCES.  The bill
 20  4 transfers numerous substances classified as "hallucinogenic
 20  5 substances" under schedule I and reclassifies the substances
 20  6 as "other substances" under schedule I.  By transferring the
 20  7 substances to "other substances", a person commits a class "C"
 20  8 felony under Code section 124.401(1)(c)(8) if the violation
 20  9 involves such a substance. Under current law, a person commits
 20 10 an aggravated misdemeanor under Code section 124.401(1)(d) when
 20 11 committing such violations.
 20 12    The bill adds new substances as "hallucinogenic substances"
 20 13 under schedule I.  A person commits a class "C" felony under
 20 14 Code section 124.401(1)(c)(8) if the violation involves the new
 20 15 hallucinogenic substances.
 20 16    The bill adds new substances as "stimulants" under schedule
 20 17 I.  A person commits a class "C" felony under Code section
 20 18 124.401(1)(c)(8) if the violation involves the new stimulant
 20 19 substances.
 20 20    The bill also adds new substances to the classification of
 20 21 "other substances" under schedule I.  A person commits a class
 20 22 "C" felony under Code section 124.401(1)(c)(8) for a violation
 20 23 involving the new substances.
 20 24    The bill strikes one substance classified as a
 20 25 "hallucinogenic substance" under schedule I and reclassifies
 20 26 the substance as a "stimulant" containing a synthetic cathinone
 20 27 under schedule I.  The transfer of the substance within
 20 28 schedule I also changes the criminal penalty for a violation
 20 29 involving the substance from a class "C" felony under Code
 20 30 section 124.401(1)(c)(8) to an aggravated misdemeanor under
 20 31 Code section 124.401(1)(d).  The bill also strikes a substance
 20 32 in Code section 124.204(6)(i)(3) from schedule I and does not
 20 33 reclassify the substance in any other substance schedule.
 20 34    The bill also removes numerous substances from schedule I
 20 35 which are currently classified as "stimulants" in Code section
 21  1 124.204(6)(i).
 21  2    The bill also strikes two narcotic substances from schedule
 21  3 III and adds three substances to schedule IV.  A violation
 21  4 involving a schedule IV controlled substance is punishable as
 21  5 an aggravated misdemeanor in Code section 124.401(1)(d).

 15  1 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
 15  2    This bill relates to controlled substances, including by
 15  3 enhancing the penalties for imitation controlled substances,
 15  4 modifying the controlled substances listed in schedules I,
 15  5 III, IV, and temporarily designating substances as controlled
 15  6 substances.
 15  7    TEMPORARY CONTROLLED SUBSTANCE DESIGNATION.  Under current
 15  8 law and in the bill, the board of pharmacy may designate a new
 15  9 substance as a controlled substance, by administrative rule,
 15 10 without the general assembly amending Code chapter 124, only
 15 11 if the substance is designated as a controlled substance under
 15 12 federal law.
 15 13    If the board of pharmacy designates a substance as
 15 14 controlled, the bill specifies that the temporary designation
 15 15 is considered a temporary amendment to the schedules of
 15 16 controlled substances in Code chapter 124, and if the general
 15 17 assembly does not amend Code chapter 124 to enact the  temporary
 15 18 amendment and make the enactment effective within two years
 15 19 from the date the temporary amendment first became effective,
 15 20 the temporary amendment is repealed by operation of law two
 15 21 years from the effective date of the temporary amendment.  A
 15 22 temporary amendment repealed by operation of law is subject to
 15 23 Code section 4.13 relating to the construction of statutes and
 15 24 the application of a general savings provision.
 15 25    Current law provides that if within 60 days after the next
 15 26 general assembly convenes the general assembly has not made
 15 27 the corresponding changes in Code chapter 124, the temporary
 15 28 designation that the substance is a controlled substance is
 15 29 nullified.
 15 30    COCAINE BASE.  The bill increases the amounts of controlled
 15 31 substances containing cocaine base (crack cocaine) that
 15 32 determine the criminal penalty for certain offenses.  Under
 15 33 the bill, if a person unlawfully manufactures, delivers, or
 15 34 possesses with the intent to deliver a controlled substance
 15 35 containing cocaine base, or unlawfully acts with, enters into
 16  1 a common scheme or design with, or conspires with one or more
 16  2 persons to manufacture, deliver, or possess such a controlled
 16  3 substance, the person commits the following offenses: a class
 16  4 "B" felony punishable by confinement of no more than 50 years
 16  5 and a fine of not more than $1 million if the controlled
 16  6 substance containing cocaine base is more than 125 grams rather
 16  7 than the current 50 grams; a class "B" felony punishable by
 16  8 confinement of no more than 25 years and a fine of not less than
 16  9 $5,000 but not more than $100,000 if the imitation controlled
 16 10 substance is more than 35 grams but not more than 125 grams
 16 11 rather than the current 10 to 50 grams; or a class "C" felony
 16 12 punishable by a fine of not less than $1,000 but not more than
 16 13 $50,000 if the controlled substance containing cocaine base is
 16 14 35 grams or less rather than the current 10 grams or less.
 16 15    IMITATION CONTROLLED SUBSTANCES.  Under current law
 16 16 imitation controlled substances are regulated under Code
 16 17 chapter 124A.  The bill repeals Code chapter 124A and transfers
 16 18 the regulation of imitation controlled substances to Code
 16 19 chapter 124.  The definition and designation of an imitation
 16 20 controlled substance in Code chapter 124 remains identical
 16 21 to the definition and designation of an imitation controlled
 16 22 substance under current law in Code chapter 124A.
 16 23    Under the bill and in current law, an imitation controlled
 16 24 substance means a substance which is not a controlled substance
 16 25 but by color, shape, size, markings, and other aspects of
 16 26 dosage unit appearance, and packaging or other factors, appears
 16 27 to be or resembles a controlled substance. The board of
 16 28 pharmacy may designate a substance as an imitation controlled
 16 29 substance pursuant to the board's rulemaking authority and in
 16 30 accordance with Code chapter 17A.
 16 31    In addition, under current law and in the bill, if a
 16 32 substance has not been designated as an imitation controlled
 16 33 substance by the board of pharmacy and when dosage unit
 16 34 appearance alone does not establish that a substance is an
 16 35 imitation controlled substance, the following factors may
 17  1 be considered in determining whether the substance is an
 17  2 imitation controlled substance: the substance is represented
 17  3 as having the effect of a controlled substance; the substance
 17  4 is represented as a controlled substance or as a substitute for
 17  5 a controlled substance because of its nature or appearance;
 17  6 or a person receives money or other property having a value
 17  7 substantially greater than the actual value of the substance
 17  8 when sold.
 17  9    Under the bill, if a person unlawfully manufactures,
 17 10 delivers, or possesses with the intent to deliver an imitation
 17 11 controlled substance containing any detectable amount of those
 17 12 substances identified in Code section 124.204(9), or unlawfully
 17 13 acts with, enters into a common scheme or design with, or
 17 14 conspires with one or more persons to manufacture, deliver,
 17 15 or possess such imitation controlled substances, the person
 17 16 commits the following offense: a class "B" felony punishable
 17 17 by confinement of no more than 50 years and a fine of not more
 17 18 than $1 million if the imitation controlled substance is more
 17 19 than 10 kilograms; a class "B" felony punishable by confinement
 17 20 of no more than 25 years and a fine of not less than $5,000 but
 17 21 not more than $100,000 if the imitation controlled substance
 17 22 is more than five kilograms but not more than 10 kilograms; a
 17 23 class "C" felony punishable by a fine of not less than $1,000
 17 24 but not more than $50,000 if the imitation controlled substance
 17 25 is five kilograms or less; or an aggravated misdemeanor if the
 17 26 imitation controlled substance is classified in schedule IV or
 17 27 V; or a serious misdemeanor for a first possession offense,
 17 28 an aggravated misdemeanor for a second possession offense,
 17 29 or a class "D" felony for two or more previous possession
 17 30 offenses. Current law in Code section 124A.4 provides that if
 17 31 a person unlawfully manufactures, delivers, or possesses with
 17 32 intent to deliver an imitation controlled substance, the person
 17 33 commits an aggravated misdemeanor, or if the person delivers
 17 34 to a person under 18 years of age who is at least three years
 17 35 younger than the violator, the person commits a class "D"
 18  1 felony.  In addition, under current law, if a person unlawfully
 18  2 and knowingly publishes an advertisement or distributes in a
 18  3 public place a promotion for an imitation controlled substance
 18  4 the person commits a serious misdemeanor.
 18  5    The bill enhances the criminal penalties for controlled
 18  6 substances classified in Code sections 124.204(4)(ai) and
 18  7 124.204(6)(i) from an aggravated misdemeanor to a class "C"
 18  8 felony punishable pursuant to Code section 124.401(1)(c)(8).
 18  9 This change equalizes the criminal penalties with violations
 18 10 involving other schedule I controlled substances.
 18 11    The bill provides that if the same person commits two or
 18 12 more acts which are in violation of Code section 124.401(1)
 18 13 and the acts occur in the same location or time period so the
 18 14 acts are attributable to a single scheme, the acts may be
 18 15 considered a single violation and the weights of the imitation
 18 16 controlled substance may be combined for purposes of charging
 18 17 the offender.
 18 18    The amendment to Code section 124.401A provides that
 18 19 a person who is 18 years of age or older who unlawfully
 18 20 manufactures with the intent to distribute, distributes,
 18 21 or possesses with the intent to distribute an imitation
 18 22 controlled substance to another person 18 years of age or older
 18 23 within 1,000 feet of the real property comprising a public or
 18 24 nonpublic school, may be sentenced up to an additional term of
 18 25 confinement of five years in addition to any other penalty.
 18 26    The amendment to Code section 124.401B provides that
 18 27 a person who unlawfully possesses an imitation controlled
 18 28 substance within 1,000 feet of the real property comprising a
 18 29 school, public park, public pool, public recreation center, or
 18 30 marked school bus may be sentenced up to 100 hours of community
 18 31 service.
 18 32    The amendments to Code section 124.406 relate to the
 18 33 distribution or possession with the intent to distribute an
 18 34 imitation controlled substance to a person under 18 years of
 18 35 age.  A person who distributes or possesses with the intent to
 19  1 distribute an imitation controlled substance, represented to
 19  2 be a substance listed in schedule I or schedule II, to a person
 19  3 under 18 years of age commits a class "B" felony. The required
 19  4 penalty for such a violation is a minimum term of confinement
 19  5 of 10 years if the substance was distributed within 1,000
 19  6 feet of the real property comprising a public or nonpublic
 19  7 school, public park, public pool, or public recreation center.
 19  8 A person who distributes or possesses with the intent to
 19  9 distribute an imitation controlled substance, represented to be
 19 10 a substance listed in schedule III, to a person under 18 years
 19 11 of age, who is at least three years younger than the violator,
 19 12 commits a class "C" felony.  A person who distributes or
 19 13 possesses with the intent to distribute an imitation controlled
 19 14 substance, represented to be a substance listed in schedule
 19 15 IV or schedule V, to a person under 18 years of age, who is
 19 16 at least three years younger than the violator, commits an
 19 17 aggravated misdemeanor.
 19 18    The amendment to Code section 124.415 requires that a peace
 19 19 officer make a reasonable effort to identify a person under 18
 19 20 years of age discovered to be in possession of an imitation
 19 21 controlled substance, and if the person is not referred to
 19 22 juvenile court, the peace officer shall make a reasonable
 19 23 effort to notify the person's custodial parent of the
 19 24 possession unless the officer has reasonable grounds to believe
 19 25 such notification is not in the best interests of the person.
 19 26 The bill specifies that if the person is taken into custody
 19 27 the juvenile court officer shall make a reasonable effort to
 19 28 identify the school of attendance and to notify the school or
 19 29 nonpublic school of the taking into custody of the person.
 19 30    The bill creates Code section 124.417, which is similar to
 19 31 Code section 124A.5 repealed by the bill.  A person registered
 19 32 under Code section 124.302 does not violate the bill if the
 19 33 person manufactures, delivers, possesses, or possesses with the
 19 34 intent to manufacture or deliver, or acts with others to do
 19 35 such activities, if the person uses the imitation controlled
 20  1 substance for use as a placebo by a registered practitioner in
 20  2 the court of professional practice or research.
 20  3    SCHEDULE I, III, AND IV CONTROLLED SUBSTANCES.  The bill
 20  4 transfers numerous substances classified as "hallucinogenic
 20  5 substances" under schedule I and reclassifies the substances
 20  6 as "other substances" under schedule I.  By transferring the
 20  7 substances to "other substances", a person commits a class "C"
 20  8 felony under Code section 124.401(1)(c)(8) if the violation
 20  9 involves such a substance. Under current law, a person commits
 20 10 an aggravated misdemeanor under Code section 124.401(1)(d) when
 20 11 committing such violations.
 20 12    The bill adds new substances as "hallucinogenic substances"
 20 13 under schedule I.  A person commits a class "C" felony under
 20 14 Code section 124.401(1)(c)(8) if the violation involves the new
 20 15 hallucinogenic substances.
 20 16    The bill adds new substances as "stimulants" under schedule
 20 17 I.  A person commits a class "C" felony under Code section
 20 18 124.401(1)(c)(8) if the violation involves the new stimulant
 20 19 substances.
 20 20    The bill also adds new substances to the classification of
 20 21 "other substances" under schedule I.  A person commits a class
 20 22 "C" felony under Code section 124.401(1)(c)(8) for a violation
 20 23 involving the new substances.
 20 24    The bill strikes one substance classified as a
 20 25 "hallucinogenic substance" under schedule I and reclassifies
 20 26 the substance as a "stimulant" containing a synthetic cathinone
 20 27 under schedule I.  The transfer of the substance within
 20 28 schedule I also changes the criminal penalty for a violation
 20 29 involving the substance from a class "C" felony under Code
 20 30 section 124.401(1)(c)(8) to an aggravated misdemeanor under
 20 31 Code section 124.401(1)(d).  The bill also strikes a substance
 20 32 in Code section 124.204(6)(i)(3) from schedule I and does not
 20 33 reclassify the substance in any other substance schedule.
 20 34    The bill also removes numerous substances from schedule I
 20 35 which are currently classified as "stimulants" in Code section
 21  1 124.204(6)(i).
 21  2    The bill also strikes two narcotic substances from schedule
 21  3 III and adds three substances to schedule IV.  A violation
 21  4 involving a schedule IV controlled substance is punishable as
 21  5 an aggravated misdemeanor in Code section 124.401(1)(d).

 15  4 modifying the controlled substances listed in schedules I,
 15  5 III, IV, and temporarily designating substances as controlled
 15  6 substances.
 15  7    TEMPORARY CONTROLLED SUBSTANCE DESIGNATION.  Under current
 15  8 law and in the bill, the board of pharmacy may designate a new
 15  9 substance as a controlled substance, by administrative rule,
 15 10 without the general assembly amending Code chapter 124, only
 15 11 if the substance is designated as a controlled substance under
 15 12 federal law.
 15 13    If the board of pharmacy designates a substance as
 15 14 controlled, the bill specifies that the temporary designation
 15 15 is considered a temporary amendment to the schedules of
 15 16 controlled substances in Code chapter 124, and if the general
 15 17 assembly does not amend Code chapter 124 to enact the  temporary

 15 19 from the date the temporary amendment first became effective,

 15 25    Current law provides that if within 60 days after the next
 15 26 general assembly convenes the general assembly has not made
 15 27 the corresponding changes in Code chapter 124, the temporary
 15 28 designation that the substance is a controlled substance is
 15 29 nullified.
 15 30    COCAINE BASE.  The bill increases the amounts of controlled
 15 31 substances containing cocaine base (crack cocaine) that
 15 32 determine the criminal penalty for certain offenses.  Under
 15 33 the bill, if a person unlawfully manufactures, delivers, or
 15 34 possesses with the intent to deliver a controlled substance
 15 35 containing cocaine base, or unlawfully acts with, enters into
 16  1 a common scheme or design with, or conspires with one or more
 16  2 persons to manufacture, deliver, or possess such a controlled
 16  3 substance, the person commits the following offenses: a class
 16  4 "B" felony punishable by confinement of no more than 50 years
 16  5 and a fine of not more than $1 million if the controlled
 16  6 substance containing cocaine base is more than 125 grams rather
 16  7 than the current 50 grams; a class "B" felony punishable by
 16  8 confinement of no more than 25 years and a fine of not less than

 16 14 35 grams or less rather than the current 10 grams or less.
 16 15    IMITATION CONTROLLED SUBSTANCES.  Under current law
 16 16 imitation controlled substances are regulated under Code
 16 17 chapter 124A.  The bill repeals Code chapter 124A and transfers
 16 18 the regulation of imitation controlled substances to Code
 16 19 chapter 124.  The definition and designation of an imitation
 16 20 controlled substance in Code chapter 124 remains identical
 16 21 to the definition and designation of an imitation controlled
 16 22 substance under current law in Code chapter 124A.
 16 23    Under the bill and in current law, an imitation controlled
 16 24 substance means a substance which is not a controlled substance
 16 25 but by color, shape, size, markings, and other aspects of
 16 26 dosage unit appearance, and packaging or other factors, appears
 16 27 to be or resembles a controlled substance. The board of
 16 28 pharmacy may designate a substance as an imitation controlled
 16 29 substance pursuant to the board's rulemaking authority and in
 16 30 accordance with Code chapter 17A.
 16 31    In addition, under current law and in the bill, if a
 16 32 substance has not been designated as an imitation controlled
 16 33 substance by the board of pharmacy and when dosage unit
 16 34 appearance alone does not establish that a substance is an
 16 35 imitation controlled substance, the following factors may
 17  1 be considered in determining whether the substance is an
 17  2 imitation controlled substance: the substance is represented
 17  3 as having the effect of a controlled substance; the substance

 17  7 substantially greater than the actual value of the substance
 17  8 when sold.

 17 10 delivers, or possesses with the intent to deliver an imitation
 17 11 controlled substance containing any detectable amount of those
 17 12 substances identified in Code section 124.204(9), or unlawfully
 17 13 acts with, enters into a common scheme or design with, or
 17 14 conspires with one or more persons to manufacture, deliver,
 17 15 or possess such imitation controlled substances, the person
 17 16 commits the following offense: a class "B" felony punishable
 17 17 by confinement of no more than 50 years and a fine of not more
 17 18 than $1 million if the imitation controlled substance is more
 17 19 than 10 kilograms; a class "B" felony punishable by confinement
 17 20 of no more than 25 years and a fine of not less than $5,000 but
 17 21 not more than $100,000 if the imitation controlled substance
 17 22 is more than five kilograms but not more than 10 kilograms; a
 17 23 class "C" felony punishable by a fine of not less than $1,000
 17 24 but not more than $50,000 if the imitation controlled substance
 17 25 is five kilograms or less; or an aggravated misdemeanor if the

 17 28 an aggravated misdemeanor for a second possession offense,
 17 29 or a class "D" felony for two or more previous possession
 17 30 offenses. Current law in Code section 124A.4 provides that if
 17 31 a person unlawfully manufactures, delivers, or possesses with
 17 32 intent to deliver an imitation controlled substance, the person
 17 33 commits an aggravated misdemeanor, or if the person delivers
 17 34 to a person under 18 years of age who is at least three years
 17 35 younger than the violator, the person commits a class "D"
 18  1 felony.  In addition, under current law, if a person unlawfully
 18  2 and knowingly publishes an advertisement or distributes in a
 18  3 public place a promotion for an imitation controlled substance
 18  4 the person commits a serious misdemeanor.
 18  5    The bill enhances the criminal penalties for controlled
 18  6 substances classified in Code sections 124.204(4)(ai) and
 18  7 124.204(6)(i) from an aggravated misdemeanor to a class "C"
 18  8 felony punishable pursuant to Code section 124.401(1)(c)(8).
 18  9 This change equalizes the criminal penalties with violations
 18 10 involving other schedule I controlled substances.
 18 11    The bill provides that if the same person commits two or
 18 12 more acts which are in violation of Code section 124.401(1)
 18 13 and the acts occur in the same location or time period so the
 18 14 acts are attributable to a single scheme, the acts may be

 19  1 distribute an imitation controlled substance, represented to
 19  2 be a substance listed in schedule I or schedule II, to a person
 19  3 under 18 years of age commits a class "B" felony. The required

 19  5 of 10 years if the substance was distributed within 1,000
 19  6 feet of the real property comprising a public or nonpublic
 19  7 school, public park, public pool, or public recreation center.

 19 15 IV or schedule V, to a person under 18 years of age, who is
 19 16 at least three years younger than the violator, commits an
 19 17 aggravated misdemeanor.
 19 18    The amendment to Code section 124.415 requires that a peace
 19 19 officer make a reasonable effort to identify a person under 18
 19 20 years of age discovered to be in possession of an imitation
 19 21 controlled substance, and if the person is not referred to
 19 22 juvenile court, the peace officer shall make a reasonable
 19 23 effort to notify the person's custodial parent of the
 19 24 possession unless the officer has reasonable grounds to believe
 19 25 such notification is not in the best interests of the person.
 19 26 The bill specifies that if the person is taken into custody
 19 27 the juvenile court officer shall make a reasonable effort to
 19 28 identify the school of attendance and to notify the school or
 19 29 nonpublic school of the taking into custody of the person.
 19 30    The bill creates Code section 124.417, which is similar to
 19 31 Code section 124A.5 repealed by the bill.  A person registered
 19 32 under Code section 124.302 does not violate the bill if the
 19 33 person manufactures, delivers, possesses, or possesses with the
 19 34 intent to manufacture or deliver, or acts with others to do
 19 35 such activities, if the person uses the imitation controlled
 20  1 substance for use as a placebo by a registered practitioner in
 20  2 the court of professional practice or research.
 20  3    SCHEDULE I, III, AND IV CONTROLLED SUBSTANCES.  The bill
 20  4 transfers numerous substances classified as "hallucinogenic
 20  5 substances" under schedule I and reclassifies the substances
 20  6 as "other substances" under schedule I.  By transferring the
 20  7 substances to "other substances", a person commits a class "C"
 20  8 felony under Code section 124.401(1)(c)(8) if the violation
 20  9 involves such a substance. Under current law, a person commits
 20 10 an aggravated misdemeanor under Code section 124.401(1)(d) when
 20 11 committing such violations.
 20 12    The bill adds new substances as "hallucinogenic substances"
 20 13 under schedule I.  A person commits a class "C" felony under
 20 14 Code section 124.401(1)(c)(8) if the violation involves the new
 20 15 hallucinogenic substances.
 20 16    The bill adds new substances as "stimulants" under schedule
 20 17 I.  A person commits a class "C" felony under Code section
 20 18 124.401(1)(c)(8) if the violation involves the new stimulant
 20 19 substances.
 20 20    The bill also adds new substances to the classification of
 20 21 "other substances" under schedule I.  A person commits a class
 20 22 "C" felony under Code section 124.401(1)(c)(8) for a violation
 20 23 involving the new substances.
 20 24    The bill strikes one substance classified as a
 20 25 "hallucinogenic substance" under schedule I and reclassifies
 20 26 the substance as a "stimulant" containing a synthetic cathinone
 20 27 under schedule I.  The transfer of the substance within
 20 28 schedule I also changes the criminal penalty for a violation
 20 29 involving the substance from a class "C" felony under Code
 20 30 section 124.401(1)(c)(8) to an aggravated misdemeanor under
 20 31 Code section 124.401(1)(d).  The bill also strikes a substance
 20 32 in Code section 124.204(6)(i)(3) from schedule I and does not
 20 33 reclassify the substance in any other substance schedule.
 20 34    The bill also removes numerous substances from schedule I
 20 35 which are currently classified as "stimulants" in Code section
 21  1 124.204(6)(i).
 21  2    The bill also strikes two narcotic substances from schedule
 21  3 III and adds three substances to schedule IV.  A violation
 21  4 involving a schedule IV controlled substance is punishable as
 21  5 an aggravated misdemeanor in Code section 124.401(1)(d).

 15  4 modifying the controlled substances listed in schedules I,
 15  5 III, IV, and temporarily designating substances as controlled
 15  6 substances.
 15  7    TEMPORARY CONTROLLED SUBSTANCE DESIGNATION.  Under current
 15  8 law and in the bill, the board of pharmacy may designate a new
 15  9 substance as a controlled substance, by administrative rule,
 15 10 without the general assembly amending Code chapter 124, only
 15 11 if the substance is designated as a controlled substance under
 15 12 federal law.
 15 13    If the board of pharmacy designates a substance as
 15 14 controlled, the bill specifies that the temporary designation
 15 15 is considered a temporary amendment to the schedules of
 15 16 controlled substances in Code chapter 124, and if the general
 15 17 assembly does not amend Code chapter 124 to enact the  temporary
 15 18 amendment and make the enactment effective within two years
 15 19 from the date the temporary amendment first became effective,
 15 20 the temporary amendment is repealed by operation of law two
 15 21 years from the effective date of the temporary amendment.  A
 15 22 temporary amendment repealed by operation of law is subject to
 15 23 Code section 4.13 relating to the construction of statutes and
 15 24 the application of a general savings provision.
 15 25    Current law provides that if within 60 days after the next
 15 26 general assembly convenes the general assembly has not made
 15 27 the corresponding changes in Code chapter 124, the temporary
 15 28 designation that the substance is a controlled substance is
 15 29 nullified.
 15 30    COCAINE BASE.  The bill increases the amounts of controlled
 15 31 substances containing cocaine base (crack cocaine) that
 15 32 determine the criminal penalty for certain offenses.  Under
 15 33 the bill, if a person unlawfully manufactures, delivers, or
 15 34 possesses with the intent to deliver a controlled substance
 15 35 containing cocaine base, or unlawfully acts with, enters into
 16  1 a common scheme or design with, or conspires with one or more
 16  2 persons to manufacture, deliver, or possess such a controlled
 16  3 substance, the person commits the following offenses: a class
 16  4 "B" felony punishable by confinement of no more than 50 years
 16  5 and a fine of not more than $1 million if the controlled
 16  6 substance containing cocaine base is more than 125 grams rather
 16  7 than the current 50 grams; a class "B" felony punishable by
 16  8 confinement of no more than 25 years and a fine of not less than
 16  9 $5,000 but not more than $100,000 if the imitation controlled
 16 10 substance is more than 35 grams but not more than 125 grams
 16 11 rather than the current 10 to 50 grams; or a class "C" felony
 16 12 punishable by a fine of not less than $1,000 but not more than
 16 13 $50,000 if the controlled substance containing cocaine base is
 16 14 35 grams or less rather than the current 10 grams or less.
 16 15    IMITATION CONTROLLED SUBSTANCES.  Under current law
 16 16 imitation controlled substances are regulated under Code
 16 17 chapter 124A.  The bill repeals Code chapter 124A and transfers
 16 18 the regulation of imitation controlled substances to Code
 16 19 chapter 124.  The definition and designation of an imitation
 16 20 controlled substance in Code chapter 124 remains identical
 16 21 to the definition and designation of an imitation controlled
 16 22 substance under current law in Code chapter 124A.
 16 23    Under the bill and in current law, an imitation controlled
 16 24 substance means a substance which is not a controlled substance
 16 25 but by color, shape, size, markings, and other aspects of
 16 26 dosage unit appearance, and packaging or other factors, appears
 16 27 to be or resembles a controlled substance. The board of
 16 28 pharmacy may designate a substance as an imitation controlled
 16 29 substance pursuant to the board's rulemaking authority and in
 16 30 accordance with Code chapter 17A.
 16 31    In addition, under current law and in the bill, if a
 16 32 substance has not been designated as an imitation controlled
 16 33 substance by the board of pharmacy and when dosage unit
 16 34 appearance alone does not establish that a substance is an
 16 35 imitation controlled substance, the following factors may
 17  1 be considered in determining whether the substance is an
 17  2 imitation controlled substance: the substance is represented
 17  3 as having the effect of a controlled substance; the substance
 17  4 is represented as a controlled substance or as a substitute for
 17  5 a controlled substance because of its nature or appearance;
 17  6 or a person receives money or other property having a value
 17  7 substantially greater than the actual value of the substance
 17  8 when sold.
 17  9    Under the bill, if a person unlawfully manufactures,
 17 10 delivers, or possesses with the intent to deliver an imitation
 17 11 controlled substance containing any detectable amount of those
 17 12 substances identified in Code section 124.204(9), or unlawfully
 17 13 acts with, enters into a common scheme or design with, or
 17 14 conspires with one or more persons to manufacture, deliver,
 17 15 or possess such imitation controlled substances, the person
 17 16 commits the following offense: a class "B" felony punishable
 17 17 by confinement of no more than 50 years and a fine of not more
 17 18 than $1 million if the imitation controlled substance is more
 17 19 than 10 kilograms; a class "B" felony punishable by confinement
 17 20 of no more than 25 years and a fine of not less than $5,000 but
 17 21 not more than $100,000 if the imitation controlled substance
 17 22 is more than five kilograms but not more than 10 kilograms; a
 17 23 class "C" felony punishable by a fine of not less than $1,000
 17 24 but not more than $50,000 if the imitation controlled substance
 17 25 is five kilograms or less; or an aggravated misdemeanor if the
 17 26 imitation controlled substance is classified in schedule IV or
 17 27 V; or a serious misdemeanor for a first possession offense,
 17 28 an aggravated misdemeanor for a second possession offense,
 17 29 or a class "D" felony for two or more previous possession
 17 30 offenses. Current law in Code section 124A.4 provides that if
 17 31 a person unlawfully manufactures, delivers, or possesses with
 17 32 intent to deliver an imitation controlled substance, the person
 17 33 commits an aggravated misdemeanor, or if the person delivers
 17 34 to a person under 18 years of age who is at least three years
 17 35 younger than the violator, the person commits a class "D"
 18  1 felony.  In addition, under current law, if a person unlawfully
 18  2 and knowingly publishes an advertisement or distributes in a
 18  3 public place a promotion for an imitation controlled substance
 18  4 the person commits a serious misdemeanor.
 18  5    The bill enhances the criminal penalties for controlled
 18  6 substances classified in Code sections 124.204(4)(ai) and
 18  7 124.204(6)(i) from an aggravated misdemeanor to a class "C"
 18  8 felony punishable pursuant to Code section 124.401(1)(c)(8).
 18  9 This change equalizes the criminal penalties with violations
 18 10 involving other schedule I controlled substances.
 18 11    The bill provides that if the same person commits two or
 18 12 more acts which are in violation of Code section 124.401(1)
 18 13 and the acts occur in the same location or time period so the
 18 14 acts are attributable to a single scheme, the acts may be
 18 15 considered a single violation and the weights of the imitation
 18 16 controlled substance may be combined for purposes of charging
 18 17 the offender.
 18 18    The amendment to Code section 124.401A provides that
 18 19 a person who is 18 years of age or older who unlawfully
 18 20 manufactures with the intent to distribute, distributes,
 18 21 or possesses with the intent to distribute an imitation
 18 22 controlled substance to another person 18 years of age or older
 18 23 within 1,000 feet of the real property comprising a public or
 18 24 nonpublic school, may be sentenced up to an additional term of
 18 25 confinement of five years in addition to any other penalty.
 18 26    The amendment to Code section 124.401B provides that
 18 27 a person who unlawfully possesses an imitation controlled
 18 28 substance within 1,000 feet of the real property comprising a
 18 29 school, public park, public pool, public recreation center, or
 18 30 marked school bus may be sentenced up to 100 hours of community
 18 31 service.
 18 32    The amendments to Code section 124.406 relate to the
 18 33 distribution or possession with the intent to distribute an
 18 34 imitation controlled substance to a person under 18 years of
 18 35 age.  A person who distributes or possesses with the intent to
 19  1 distribute an imitation controlled substance, represented to
 19  2 be a substance listed in schedule I or schedule II, to a person
 19  3 under 18 years of age commits a class "B" felony. The required
 19  4 penalty for such a violation is a minimum term of confinement
 19  5 of 10 years if the substance was distributed within 1,000
 19  6 feet of the real property comprising a public or nonpublic
 19  7 school, public park, public pool, or public recreation center.
 19  8 A person who distributes or possesses with the intent to
 19  9 distribute an imitation controlled substance, represented to be
 19 10 a substance listed in schedule III, to a person under 18 years
 19 11 of age, who is at least three years younger than the violator,
 19 12 commits a class "C" felony.  A person who distributes or
 19 13 possesses with the intent to distribute an imitation controlled
 19 14 substance, represented to be a substance listed in schedule
 19 15 IV or schedule V, to a person under 18 years of age, who is
 19 16 at least three years younger than the violator, commits an
 19 17 aggravated misdemeanor.
 19 18    The amendment to Code section 124.415 requires that a peace
 19 19 officer make a reasonable effort to identify a person under 18
 19 20 years of age discovered to be in possession of an imitation
 19 21 controlled substance, and if the person is not referred to
 19 22 juvenile court, the peace officer shall make a reasonable
 19 23 effort to notify the person's custodial parent of the
 19 24 possession unless the officer has reasonable grounds to believe
 19 25 such notification is not in the best interests of the person.
 19 26 The bill specifies that if the person is taken into custody
 19 27 the juvenile court officer shall make a reasonable effort to
 19 28 identify the school of attendance and to notify the school or
 19 29 nonpublic school of the taking into custody of the person.
 19 30    The bill creates Code section 124.417, which is similar to
 19 31 Code section 124A.5 repealed by the bill.  A person registered
 19 32 under Code section 124.302 does not violate the bill if the
 19 33 person manufactures, delivers, possesses, or possesses with the
 19 34 intent to manufacture or deliver, or acts with others to do
 19 35 such activities, if the person uses the imitation controlled
 20  1 substance for use as a placebo by a registered practitioner in
 20  2 the court of professional practice or research.
 20  3    SCHEDULE I, III, AND IV CONTROLLED SUBSTANCES.  The bill
 20  4 transfers numerous substances classified as "hallucinogenic
 20  5 substances" under schedule I and reclassifies the substances
 20  6 as "other substances" under schedule I.  By transferring the
 20  7 substances to "other substances", a person commits a class "C"
 20  8 felony under Code section 124.401(1)(c)(8) if the violation
 20  9 involves such a substance. Under current law, a person commits
 20 10 an aggravated misdemeanor under Code section 124.401(1)(d) when
 20 11 committing such violations.
 20 12    The bill adds new substances as "hallucinogenic substances"
 20 13 under schedule I.  A person commits a class "C" felony under
 20 14 Code section 124.401(1)(c)(8) if the violation involves the new
 20 15 hallucinogenic substances.
 20 16    The bill adds new substances as "stimulants" under schedule
 20 17 I.  A person commits a class "C" felony under Code section
 20 18 124.401(1)(c)(8) if the violation involves the new stimulant
 20 19 substances.
 20 20    The bill also adds new substances to the classification of
 20 21 "other substances" under schedule I.  A person commits a class
 20 22 "C" felony under Code section 124.401(1)(c)(8) for a violation
 20 23 involving the new substances.
 20 24    The bill strikes one substance classified as a
 20 25 "hallucinogenic substance" under schedule I and reclassifies
 20 26 the substance as a "stimulant" containing a synthetic cathinone
 20 27 under schedule I.  The transfer of the substance within
 20 28 schedule I also changes the criminal penalty for a violation
 20 29 involving the substance from a class "C" felony under Code
 20 30 section 124.401(1)(c)(8) to an aggravated misdemeanor under
 20 31 Code section 124.401(1)(d).  The bill also strikes a substance
 20 32 in Code section 124.204(6)(i)(3) from schedule I and does not
 20 33 reclassify the substance in any other substance schedule.
 20 34    The bill also removes numerous substances from schedule I
 20 35 which are currently classified as "stimulants" in Code section
 21  1 124.204(6)(i).
 21  2    The bill also strikes two narcotic substances from schedule

 15 28 designation that the substance is a controlled substance is
 15 29 nullified.
 15 30    COCAINE BASE.  The bill increases the amounts of controlled
 15 31 substances containing cocaine base (crack cocaine) that
 15 32 determine the criminal penalty for certain offenses.  Under
 15 33 the bill, if a person unlawfully manufactures, delivers, or
 15 34 possesses with the intent to deliver a controlled substance
 15 35 containing cocaine base, or unlawfully acts with, enters into
 16  1 a common scheme or design with, or conspires with one or more
 16  2 persons to manufacture, deliver, or possess such a controlled
 16  3 substance, the person commits the following offenses: a class
 16  4 "B" felony punishable by confinement of no more than 50 years
 16  5 and a fine of not more than $1 million if the controlled
 16  6 substance containing cocaine base is more than 125 grams rather
 16  7 than the current 50 grams; a class "B" felony punishable by
 16  8 confinement of no more than 25 years and a fine of not less than
 16  9 $5,000 but not more than $100,000 if the imitation controlled
 16 10 substance is more than 35 grams but not more than 125 grams
 16 11 rather than the current 10 to 50 grams; or a class "C" felony
 16 12 punishable by a fine of not less than $1,000 but not more than
 16 13 $50,000 if the controlled substance containing cocaine base is
 16 14 35 grams or less rather than the current 10 grams or less.
 16 15    IMITATION CONTROLLED SUBSTANCES.  Under current law
 16 16 imitation controlled substances are regulated under Code
 16 17 chapter 124A.  The bill repeals Code chapter 124A and transfers
 16 18 the regulation of imitation controlled substances to Code
 16 19 chapter 124.  The definition and designation of an imitation
 16 20 controlled substance in Code chapter 124 remains identical
 16 21 to the definition and designation of an imitation controlled
 16 22 substance under current law in Code chapter 124A.
 16 23    Under the bill and in current law, an imitation controlled
 16 24 substance means a substance which is not a controlled substance
 16 25 but by color, shape, size, markings, and other aspects of
 16 26 dosage unit appearance, and packaging or other factors, appears
 16 27 to be or resembles a controlled substance. The board of
 16 28 pharmacy may designate a substance as an imitation controlled
 16 29 substance pursuant to the board's rulemaking authority and in
 16 30 accordance with Code chapter 17A.
 16 31    In addition, under current law and in the bill, if a
 16 32 substance has not been designated as an imitation controlled
 16 33 substance by the board of pharmacy and when dosage unit
 16 34 appearance alone does not establish that a substance is an
 16 35 imitation controlled substance, the following factors may
 17  1 be considered in determining whether the substance is an
 17  2 imitation controlled substance: the substance is represented
 17  3 as having the effect of a controlled substance; the substance
 17  4 is represented as a controlled substance or as a substitute for
 17  5 a controlled substance because of its nature or appearance;

 17 10 delivers, or possesses with the intent to deliver an imitation
 17 11 controlled substance containing any detectable amount of those
 17 12 substances identified in Code section 124.204(9), or unlawfully
 17 13 acts with, enters into a common scheme or design with, or
 17 14 conspires with one or more persons to manufacture, deliver,
 17 15 or possess such imitation controlled substances, the person
 17 16 commits the following offense: a class "B" felony punishable
 17 17 by confinement of no more than 50 years and a fine of not more
 17 18 than $1 million if the imitation controlled substance is more
 17 19 than 10 kilograms; a class "B" felony punishable by confinement
 17 20 of no more than 25 years and a fine of not less than $5,000 but
 17 21 not more than $100,000 if the imitation controlled substance
 17 22 is more than five kilograms but not more than 10 kilograms; a

 18  4 the person commits a serious misdemeanor.
 18  5    The bill enhances the criminal penalties for controlled

 18 18    The amendment to Code section 124.401A provides that
 18 19 a person who is 18 years of age or older who unlawfully
 18 20 manufactures with the intent to distribute, distributes,
 18 21 or possesses with the intent to distribute an imitation
 18 22 controlled substance to another person 18 years of age or older
 18 23 within 1,000 feet of the real property comprising a public or
 18 24 nonpublic school, may be sentenced up to an additional term of
 18 25 confinement of five years in addition to any other penalty.
 18 26    The amendment to Code section 124.401B provides that
 18 27 a person who unlawfully possesses an imitation controlled
 18 28 substance within 1,000 feet of the real property comprising a
 18 29 school, public park, public pool, public recreation center, or
 18 30 marked school bus may be sentenced up to 100 hours of community
 18 31 service.
 18 32    The amendments to Code section 124.406 relate to the
 18 33 distribution or possession with the intent to distribute an
 18 34 imitation controlled substance to a person under 18 years of
 18 35 age.  A person who distributes or possesses with the intent to
 19  1 distribute an imitation controlled substance, represented to
 19  2 be a substance listed in schedule I or schedule II, to a person
 19  3 under 18 years of age commits a class "B" felony. The required
 19  4 penalty for such a violation is a minimum term of confinement
 19  5 of 10 years if the substance was distributed within 1,000
 19  6 feet of the real property comprising a public or nonpublic
 19  7 school, public park, public pool, or public recreation center.
 19  8 A person who distributes or possesses with the intent to
 19  9 distribute an imitation controlled substance, represented to be
 19 10 a substance listed in schedule III, to a person under 18 years
 19 11 of age, who is at least three years younger than the violator,
 19 12 commits a class "C" felony.  A person who distributes or
 19 13 possesses with the intent to distribute an imitation controlled
 19 14 substance, represented to be a substance listed in schedule
 19 15 IV or schedule V, to a person under 18 years of age, who is
 19 16 at least three years younger than the violator, commits an
 19 17 aggravated misdemeanor.
 19 18    The amendment to Code section 124.415 requires that a peace
 19 19 officer make a reasonable effort to identify a person under 18
 19 20 years of age discovered to be in possession of an imitation
 19 21 controlled substance, and if the person is not referred to
 19 22 juvenile court, the peace officer shall make a reasonable
 19 23 effort to notify the person's custodial parent of the
 19 24 possession unless the officer has reasonable grounds to believe
 19 25 such notification is not in the best interests of the person.
 19 26 The bill specifies that if the person is taken into custody
 19 27 the juvenile court officer shall make a reasonable effort to
 19 28 identify the school of attendance and to notify the school or
 19 29 nonpublic school of the taking into custody of the person.
 19 30    The bill creates Code section 124.417, which is similar to
 19 31 Code section 124A.5 repealed by the bill.  A person registered
 19 32 under Code section 124.302 does not violate the bill if the
 19 33 person manufactures, delivers, possesses, or possesses with the
 19 34 intent to manufacture or deliver, or acts with others to do
 19 35 such activities, if the person uses the imitation controlled
 20  1 substance for use as a placebo by a registered practitioner in
 20  2 the court of professional practice or research.
 20  3    SCHEDULE I, III, AND IV CONTROLLED SUBSTANCES.  The bill
 20  4 transfers numerous substances classified as "hallucinogenic
 20  5 substances" under schedule I and reclassifies the substances
 20  6 as "other substances" under schedule I.  By transferring the
 20  7 substances to "other substances", a person commits a class "C"
 20  8 felony under Code section 124.401(1)(c)(8) if the violation
 20  9 involves such a substance. Under current law, a person commits
 20 10 an aggravated misdemeanor under Code section 124.401(1)(d) when
 20 11 committing such violations.
 20 12    The bill adds new substances as "hallucinogenic substances"
 20 13 under schedule I.  A person commits a class "C" felony under
 20 14 Code section 124.401(1)(c)(8) if the violation involves the new
 20 15 hallucinogenic substances.
 20 16    The bill adds new substances as "stimulants" under schedule
 20 17 I.  A person commits a class "C" felony under Code section
 20 18 124.401(1)(c)(8) if the violation involves the new stimulant
 20 19 substances.
 20 20    The bill also adds new substances to the classification of
 20 21 "other substances" under schedule I.  A person commits a class
 20 22 "C" felony under Code section 124.401(1)(c)(8) for a violation
 20 23 involving the new substances.
 20 24    The bill strikes one substance classified as a
 20 25 "hallucinogenic substance" under schedule I and reclassifies
 20 26 the substance as a "stimulant" containing a synthetic cathinone
 20 27 under schedule I.  The transfer of the substance within
 20 28 schedule I also changes the criminal penalty for a violation
 20 29 involving the substance from a class "C" felony under Code
 20 30 section 124.401(1)(c)(8) to an aggravated misdemeanor under
 20 31 Code section 124.401(1)(d).  The bill also strikes a substance
 20 32 in Code section 124.204(6)(i)(3) from schedule I and does not
 20 33 reclassify the substance in any other substance schedule.
 20 34    The bill also removes numerous substances from schedule I
 20 35 which are currently classified as "stimulants" in Code section
 21  1 124.204(6)(i).
 21  2    The bill also strikes two narcotic substances from schedule
 21  3 III and adds three substances to schedule IV.  A violation
 21  4 involving a schedule IV controlled substance is punishable as
 21  5 an aggravated misdemeanor in Code section 124.401(1)(d).

 15  5 III, IV, and temporarily designating substances as controlled
 15  6 substances.
 15  7    TEMPORARY CONTROLLED SUBSTANCE DESIGNATION.  Under current
 15  8 law and in the bill, the board of pharmacy may designate a new
 15  9 substance as a controlled substance, by administrative rule,
 15 10 without the general assembly amending Code chapter 124, only
 15 11 if the substance is designated as a controlled substance under
 15 12 federal law.
 15 13    If the board of pharmacy designates a substance as
 15 14 controlled, the bill specifies that the temporary designation
 15 15 is considered a temporary amendment to the schedules of
 15 16 controlled substances in Code chapter 124, and if the general
 15 17 assembly does not amend Code chapter 124 to enact the  temporary
 15 18 amendment and make the enactment effective within two years
 15 19 from the date the temporary amendment first became effective,
 15 20 the temporary amendment is repealed by operation of law two
 15 21 years from the effective date of the temporary amendment.  A
 15 22 temporary amendment repealed by operation of law is subject to
 15 23 Code section 4.13 relating to the construction of statutes and
 15 24 the application of a general savings provision.
 15 25    Current law provides that if within 60 days after the next
 15 26 general assembly convenes the general assembly has not made
 15 27 the corresponding changes in Code chapter 124, the temporary
 15 28 designation that the substance is a controlled substance is
 15 29 nullified.
 15 30    COCAINE BASE.  The bill increases the amounts of controlled
 15 31 substances containing cocaine base (crack cocaine) that
 15 32 determine the criminal penalty for certain offenses.  Under
 15 33 the bill, if a person unlawfully manufactures, delivers, or
 15 34 possesses with the intent to deliver a controlled substance
 15 35 containing cocaine base, or unlawfully acts with, enters into
 16  1 a common scheme or design with, or conspires with one or more
 16  2 persons to manufacture, deliver, or possess such a controlled
 16  3 substance, the person commits the following offenses: a class
 16  4 "B" felony punishable by confinement of no more than 50 years
 16  5 and a fine of not more than $1 million if the controlled
 16  6 substance containing cocaine base is more than 125 grams rather
 16  7 than the current 50 grams; a class "B" felony punishable by
 16  8 confinement of no more than 25 years and a fine of not less than
 16  9 $5,000 but not more than $100,000 if the imitation controlled
 16 10 substance is more than 35 grams but not more than 125 grams
 16 11 rather than the current 10 to 50 grams; or a class "C" felony
 16 12 punishable by a fine of not less than $1,000 but not more than
 16 13 $50,000 if the controlled substance containing cocaine base is
 16 14 35 grams or less rather than the current 10 grams or less.
 16 15    IMITATION CONTROLLED SUBSTANCES.  Under current law
 16 16 imitation controlled substances are regulated under Code
 16 17 chapter 124A.  The bill repeals Code chapter 124A and transfers
 16 18 the regulation of imitation controlled substances to Code
 16 19 chapter 124.  The definition and designation of an imitation
 16 20 controlled substance in Code chapter 124 remains identical
 16 21 to the definition and designation of an imitation controlled
 16 22 substance under current law in Code chapter 124A.
 16 23    Under the bill and in current law, an imitation controlled
 16 24 substance means a substance which is not a controlled substance
 16 25 but by color, shape, size, markings, and other aspects of
 16 26 dosage unit appearance, and packaging or other factors, appears
 16 27 to be or resembles a controlled substance. The board of
 16 28 pharmacy may designate a substance as an imitation controlled
 16 29 substance pursuant to the board's rulemaking authority and in
 16 30 accordance with Code chapter 17A.
 16 31    In addition, under current law and in the bill, if a
 16 32 substance has not been designated as an imitation controlled
 16 33 substance by the board of pharmacy and when dosage unit
 16 34 appearance alone does not establish that a substance is an
 16 35 imitation controlled substance, the following factors may
 17  1 be considered in determining whether the substance is an
 17  2 imitation controlled substance: the substance is represented
 17  3 as having the effect of a controlled substance; the substance
 17  4 is represented as a controlled substance or as a substitute for
 17  5 a controlled substance because of its nature or appearance;
 17  6 or a person receives money or other property having a value
 17  7 substantially greater than the actual value of the substance
 17  8 when sold.
 17  9    Under the bill, if a person unlawfully manufactures,
 17 10 delivers, or possesses with the intent to deliver an imitation
 17 11 controlled substance containing any detectable amount of those
 17 12 substances identified in Code section 124.204(9), or unlawfully
 17 13 acts with, enters into a common scheme or design with, or
 17 14 conspires with one or more persons to manufacture, deliver,
 17 15 or possess such imitation controlled substances, the person
 17 16 commits the following offense: a class "B" felony punishable
 17 17 by confinement of no more than 50 years and a fine of not more
 17 18 than $1 million if the imitation controlled substance is more
 17 19 than 10 kilograms; a class "B" felony punishable by confinement
 17 20 of no more than 25 years and a fine of not less than $5,000 but
 17 21 not more than $100,000 if the imitation controlled substance
 17 22 is more than five kilograms but not more than 10 kilograms; a
 17 23 class "C" felony punishable by a fine of not less than $1,000
 17 24 but not more than $50,000 if the imitation controlled substance
 17 25 is five kilograms or less; or an aggravated misdemeanor if the
 17 26 imitation controlled substance is classified in schedule IV or
 17 27 V; or a serious misdemeanor for a first possession offense,
 17 28 an aggravated misdemeanor for a second possession offense,
 17 29 or a class "D" felony for two or more previous possession
 17 30 offenses. Current law in Code section 124A.4 provides that if
 17 31 a person unlawfully manufactures, delivers, or possesses with
 17 32 intent to deliver an imitation controlled substance, the person
 17 33 commits an aggravated misdemeanor, or if the person delivers
 17 34 to a person under 18 years of age who is at least three years
 17 35 younger than the violator, the person commits a class "D"
 18  1 felony.  In addition, under current law, if a person unlawfully
 18  2 and knowingly publishes an advertisement or distributes in a
 18  3 public place a promotion for an imitation controlled substance
 18  4 the person commits a serious misdemeanor.
 18  5    The bill enhances the criminal penalties for controlled
 18  6 substances classified in Code sections 124.204(4)(ai) and
 18  7 124.204(6)(i) from an aggravated misdemeanor to a class "C"
 18  8 felony punishable pursuant to Code section 124.401(1)(c)(8).
 18  9 This change equalizes the criminal penalties with violations
 18 10 involving other schedule I controlled substances.
 18 11    The bill provides that if the same person commits two or
 18 12 more acts which are in violation of Code section 124.401(1)
 18 13 and the acts occur in the same location or time period so the
 18 14 acts are attributable to a single scheme, the acts may be
 18 15 considered a single violation and the weights of the imitation
 18 16 controlled substance may be combined for purposes of charging
 18 17 the offender.
 18 18    The amendment to Code section 124.401A provides that
 18 19 a person who is 18 years of age or older who unlawfully
 18 20 manufactures with the intent to distribute, distributes,
 18 21 or possesses with the intent to distribute an imitation
 18 22 controlled substance to another person 18 years of age or older
 18 23 within 1,000 feet of the real property comprising a public or
 18 24 nonpublic school, may be sentenced up to an additional term of
 18 25 confinement of five years in addition to any other penalty.
 18 26    The amendment to Code section 124.401B provides that
 18 27 a person who unlawfully possesses an imitation controlled
 18 28 substance within 1,000 feet of the real property comprising a
 18 29 school, public park, public pool, public recreation center, or
 18 30 marked school bus may be sentenced up to 100 hours of community
 18 31 service.
 18 32    The amendments to Code section 124.406 relate to the
 18 33 distribution or possession with the intent to distribute an
 18 34 imitation controlled substance to a person under 18 years of
 18 35 age.  A person who distributes or possesses with the intent to
 19  1 distribute an imitation controlled substance, represented to
 19  2 be a substance listed in schedule I or schedule II, to a person
 19  3 under 18 years of age commits a class "B" felony. The required
 19  4 penalty for such a violation is a minimum term of confinement
 19  5 of 10 years if the substance was distributed within 1,000
 19  6 feet of the real property comprising a public or nonpublic
 19  7 school, public park, public pool, or public recreation center.
 19  8 A person who distributes or possesses with the intent to
 19  9 distribute an imitation controlled substance, represented to be
 19 10 a substance listed in schedule III, to a person under 18 years
 19 11 of age, who is at least three years younger than the violator,
 19 12 commits a class "C" felony.  A person who distributes or
 19 13 possesses with the intent to distribute an imitation controlled
 19 14 substance, represented to be a substance listed in schedule
 19 15 IV or schedule V, to a person under 18 years of age, who is
 19 16 at least three years younger than the violator, commits an
 19 17 aggravated misdemeanor.
 19 18    The amendment to Code section 124.415 requires that a peace
 19 19 officer make a reasonable effort to identify a person under 18
 19 20 years of age discovered to be in possession of an imitation
 19 21 controlled substance, and if the person is not referred to
 19 22 juvenile court, the peace officer shall make a reasonable
 19 23 effort to notify the person's custodial parent of the
 19 24 possession unless the officer has reasonable grounds to believe
 19 25 such notification is not in the best interests of the person.
 19 26 The bill specifies that if the person is taken into custody
 19 27 the juvenile court officer shall make a reasonable effort to
 19 28 identify the school of attendance and to notify the school or
 19 29 nonpublic school of the taking into custody of the person.
 19 30    The bill creates Code section 124.417, which is similar to
 19 31 Code section 124A.5 repealed by the bill.  A person registered
 19 32 under Code section 124.302 does not violate the bill if the
 19 33 person manufactures, delivers, possesses, or possesses with the
 19 34 intent to manufacture or deliver, or acts with others to do
 19 35 such activities, if the person uses the imitation controlled
 20  1 substance for use as a placebo by a registered practitioner in
 20  2 the court of professional practice or research.
 20  3    SCHEDULE I, III, AND IV CONTROLLED SUBSTANCES.  The bill
 20  4 transfers numerous substances classified as "hallucinogenic
 20  5 substances" under schedule I and reclassifies the substances
 20  6 as "other substances" under schedule I.  By transferring the
 20  7 substances to "other substances", a person commits a class "C"
 20  8 felony under Code section 124.401(1)(c)(8) if the violation
 20  9 involves such a substance. Under current law, a person commits
 20 10 an aggravated misdemeanor under Code section 124.401(1)(d) when
 20 11 committing such violations.
 20 12    The bill adds new substances as "hallucinogenic substances"
 20 13 under schedule I.  A person commits a class "C" felony under
 20 14 Code section 124.401(1)(c)(8) if the violation involves the new
 20 15 hallucinogenic substances.
 20 16    The bill adds new substances as "stimulants" under schedule
 20 17 I.  A person commits a class "C" felony under Code section
 20 18 124.401(1)(c)(8) if the violation involves the new stimulant
 20 19 substances.
 20 20    The bill also adds new substances to the classification of
 20 21 "other substances" under schedule I.  A person commits a class
 20 22 "C" felony under Code section 124.401(1)(c)(8) for a violation
 20 23 involving the new substances.
 20 24    The bill strikes one substance classified as a
 20 25 "hallucinogenic substance" under schedule I and reclassifies
 20 26 the substance as a "stimulant" containing a synthetic cathinone
 20 27 under schedule I.  The transfer of the substance within
 20 28 schedule I also changes the criminal penalty for a violation
 20 29 involving the substance from a class "C" felony under Code
 20 30 section 124.401(1)(c)(8) to an aggravated misdemeanor under
 20 31 Code section 124.401(1)(d).  The bill also strikes a substance
 20 32 in Code section 124.204(6)(i)(3) from schedule I and does not
 20 33 reclassify the substance in any other substance schedule.
 20 34    The bill also removes numerous substances from schedule I
 20 35 which are currently classified as "stimulants" in Code section
 21  1 124.204(6)(i).
 21  2    The bill also strikes two narcotic substances from schedule
 21  3 III and adds three substances to schedule IV.  A violation
 21  4 involving a schedule IV controlled substance is punishable as

 15 13    If the board of pharmacy designates a substance as

 15 24 the application of a general savings provision.
 15 25    Current law provides that if within 60 days after the next

 15 27 the corresponding changes in Code chapter 124, the temporary
 15 28 designation that the substance is a controlled substance is
 15 29 nullified.
 15 30    COCAINE BASE.  The bill increases the amounts of controlled
 15 31 substances containing cocaine base (crack cocaine) that
 15 32 determine the criminal penalty for certain offenses.  Under
 15 33 the bill, if a person unlawfully manufactures, delivers, or
 15 34 possesses with the intent to deliver a controlled substance
 15 35 containing cocaine base, or unlawfully acts with, enters into
 16  1 a common scheme or design with, or conspires with one or more
 16  2 persons to manufacture, deliver, or possess such a controlled
 16  3 substance, the person commits the following offenses: a class
 16  4 "B" felony punishable by confinement of no more than 50 years
 16  5 and a fine of not more than $1 million if the controlled
 16  6 substance containing cocaine base is more than 125 grams rather
 16  7 than the current 50 grams; a class "B" felony punishable by
 16  8 confinement of no more than 25 years and a fine of not less than
 16  9 $5,000 but not more than $100,000 if the imitation controlled
 16 10 substance is more than 35 grams but not more than 125 grams
 16 11 rather than the current 10 to 50 grams; or a class "C" felony
 16 12 punishable by a fine of not less than $1,000 but not more than
 16 13 $50,000 if the controlled substance containing cocaine base is
 16 14 35 grams or less rather than the current 10 grams or less.
 16 15    IMITATION CONTROLLED SUBSTANCES.  Under current law
 16 16 imitation controlled substances are regulated under Code
 16 17 chapter 124A.  The bill repeals Code chapter 124A and transfers
 16 18 the regulation of imitation controlled substances to Code
 16 19 chapter 124.  The definition and designation of an imitation
 16 20 controlled substance in Code chapter 124 remains identical
 16 21 to the definition and designation of an imitation controlled
 16 22 substance under current law in Code chapter 124A.
 16 23    Under the bill and in current law, an imitation controlled
 16 24 substance means a substance which is not a controlled substance
 16 25 but by color, shape, size, markings, and other aspects of
 16 26 dosage unit appearance, and packaging or other factors, appears
 16 27 to be or resembles a controlled substance. The board of
 16 28 pharmacy may designate a substance as an imitation controlled
 16 29 substance pursuant to the board's rulemaking authority and in
 16 30 accordance with Code chapter 17A.
 16 31    In addition, under current law and in the bill, if a
 16 32 substance has not been designated as an imitation controlled
 16 33 substance by the board of pharmacy and when dosage unit
 16 34 appearance alone does not establish that a substance is an
 16 35 imitation controlled substance, the following factors may
 17  1 be considered in determining whether the substance is an
 17  2 imitation controlled substance: the substance is represented
 17  3 as having the effect of a controlled substance; the substance
 17  4 is represented as a controlled substance or as a substitute for
 17  5 a controlled substance because of its nature or appearance;
 17  6 or a person receives money or other property having a value
 17  7 substantially greater than the actual value of the substance
 17  8 when sold.
 17  9    Under the bill, if a person unlawfully manufactures,
 17 10 delivers, or possesses with the intent to deliver an imitation
 17 11 controlled substance containing any detectable amount of those
 17 12 substances identified in Code section 124.204(9), or unlawfully
 17 13 acts with, enters into a common scheme or design with, or
 17 14 conspires with one or more persons to manufacture, deliver,
 17 15 or possess such imitation controlled substances, the person
 17 16 commits the following offense: a class "B" felony punishable
 17 17 by confinement of no more than 50 years and a fine of not more
 17 18 than $1 million if the imitation controlled substance is more
 17 19 than 10 kilograms; a class "B" felony punishable by confinement
 17 20 of no more than 25 years and a fine of not less than $5,000 but
 17 21 not more than $100,000 if the imitation controlled substance
 17 22 is more than five kilograms but not more than 10 kilograms; a
 17 23 class "C" felony punishable by a fine of not less than $1,000
 17 24 but not more than $50,000 if the imitation controlled substance
 17 25 is five kilograms or less; or an aggravated misdemeanor if the
 17 26 imitation controlled substance is classified in schedule IV or
 17 27 V; or a serious misdemeanor for a first possession offense,
 17 28 an aggravated misdemeanor for a second possession offense,
 17 29 or a class "D" felony for two or more previous possession
 17 30 offenses. Current law in Code section 124A.4 provides that if
 17 31 a person unlawfully manufactures, delivers, or possesses with
 17 32 intent to deliver an imitation controlled substance, the person
 17 33 commits an aggravated misdemeanor, or if the person delivers
 17 34 to a person under 18 years of age who is at least three years
 17 35 younger than the violator, the person commits a class "D"
 18  1 felony.  In addition, under current law, if a person unlawfully
 18  2 and knowingly publishes an advertisement or distributes in a
 18  3 public place a promotion for an imitation controlled substance
 18  4 the person commits a serious misdemeanor.
 18  5    The bill enhances the criminal penalties for controlled
 18  6 substances classified in Code sections 124.204(4)(ai) and
 18  7 124.204(6)(i) from an aggravated misdemeanor to a class "C"
 18  8 felony punishable pursuant to Code section 124.401(1)(c)(8).
 18  9 This change equalizes the criminal penalties with violations
 18 10 involving other schedule I controlled substances.
 18 11    The bill provides that if the same person commits two or
 18 12 more acts which are in violation of Code section 124.401(1)
 18 13 and the acts occur in the same location or time period so the
 18 14 acts are attributable to a single scheme, the acts may be
 18 15 considered a single violation and the weights of the imitation
 18 16 controlled substance may be combined for purposes of charging
 18 17 the offender.
 18 18    The amendment to Code section 124.401A provides that
 18 19 a person who is 18 years of age or older who unlawfully
 18 20 manufactures with the intent to distribute, distributes,
 18 21 or possesses with the intent to distribute an imitation
 18 22 controlled substance to another person 18 years of age or older
 18 23 within 1,000 feet of the real property comprising a public or
 18 24 nonpublic school, may be sentenced up to an additional term of
 18 25 confinement of five years in addition to any other penalty.
 18 26    The amendment to Code section 124.401B provides that
 18 27 a person who unlawfully possesses an imitation controlled
 18 28 substance within 1,000 feet of the real property comprising a
 18 29 school, public park, public pool, public recreation center, or
 18 30 marked school bus may be sentenced up to 100 hours of community
 18 31 service.
 18 32    The amendments to Code section 124.406 relate to the
 18 33 distribution or possession with the intent to distribute an
 18 34 imitation controlled substance to a person under 18 years of
 18 35 age.  A person who distributes or possesses with the intent to
 19  1 distribute an imitation controlled substance, represented to
 19  2 be a substance listed in schedule I or schedule II, to a person
 19  3 under 18 years of age commits a class "B" felony. The required
 19  4 penalty for such a violation is a minimum term of confinement
 19  5 of 10 years if the substance was distributed within 1,000
 19  6 feet of the real property comprising a public or nonpublic
 19  7 school, public park, public pool, or public recreation center.
 19  8 A person who distributes or possesses with the intent to
 19  9 distribute an imitation controlled substance, represented to be
 19 10 a substance listed in schedule III, to a person under 18 years
 19 11 of age, who is at least three years younger than the violator,
 19 12 commits a class "C" felony.  A person who distributes or
 19 13 possesses with the intent to distribute an imitation controlled
 19 14 substance, represented to be a substance listed in schedule
 19 15 IV or schedule V, to a person under 18 years of age, who is
 19 16 at least three years younger than the violator, commits an
 19 17 aggravated misdemeanor.
 19 18    The amendment to Code section 124.415 requires that a peace
 19 19 officer make a reasonable effort to identify a person under 18
 19 20 years of age discovered to be in possession of an imitation
 19 21 controlled substance, and if the person is not referred to
 19 22 juvenile court, the peace officer shall make a reasonable
 19 23 effort to notify the person's custodial parent of the
 19 24 possession unless the officer has reasonable grounds to believe
 19 25 such notification is not in the best interests of the person.
 19 26 The bill specifies that if the person is taken into custody
 19 27 the juvenile court officer shall make a reasonable effort to
 19 28 identify the school of attendance and to notify the school or
 19 29 nonpublic school of the taking into custody of the person.
 19 30    The bill creates Code section 124.417, which is similar to
 19 31 Code section 124A.5 repealed by the bill.  A person registered
 19 32 under Code section 124.302 does not violate the bill if the
 19 33 person manufactures, delivers, possesses, or possesses with the
 19 34 intent to manufacture or deliver, or acts with others to do
 19 35 such activities, if the person uses the imitation controlled
 20  1 substance for use as a placebo by a registered practitioner in
 20  2 the court of professional practice or research.
 20  3    SCHEDULE I, III, AND IV CONTROLLED SUBSTANCES.  The bill
 20  4 transfers numerous substances classified as "hallucinogenic
 20  5 substances" under schedule I and reclassifies the substances
 20  6 as "other substances" under schedule I.  By transferring the
 20  7 substances to "other substances", a person commits a class "C"
 20  8 felony under Code section 124.401(1)(c)(8) if the violation
 20  9 involves such a substance. Under current law, a person commits
 20 10 an aggravated misdemeanor under Code section 124.401(1)(d) when
 20 11 committing such violations.
 20 12    The bill adds new substances as "hallucinogenic substances"
 20 13 under schedule I.  A person commits a class "C" felony under
 20 14 Code section 124.401(1)(c)(8) if the violation involves the new
 20 15 hallucinogenic substances.
 20 16    The bill adds new substances as "stimulants" under schedule
 20 17 I.  A person commits a class "C" felony under Code section
 20 18 124.401(1)(c)(8) if the violation involves the new stimulant
 20 19 substances.
 20 20    The bill also adds new substances to the classification of
 20 21 "other substances" under schedule I.  A person commits a class
 20 22 "C" felony under Code section 124.401(1)(c)(8) for a violation
 20 23 involving the new substances.
 20 24    The bill strikes one substance classified as a
 20 25 "hallucinogenic substance" under schedule I and reclassifies
 20 26 the substance as a "stimulant" containing a synthetic cathinone
 20 27 under schedule I.  The transfer of the substance within
 20 28 schedule I also changes the criminal penalty for a violation
 20 29 involving the substance from a class "C" felony under Code
 20 30 section 124.401(1)(c)(8) to an aggravated misdemeanor under
 20 31 Code section 124.401(1)(d).  The bill also strikes a substance
 20 32 in Code section 124.204(6)(i)(3) from schedule I and does not
 20 33 reclassify the substance in any other substance schedule.
 20 34    The bill also removes numerous substances from schedule I
 20 35 which are currently classified as "stimulants" in Code section
 21  1 124.204(6)(i).
 21  2    The bill also strikes two narcotic substances from schedule
 21  3 III and adds three substances to schedule IV.  A violation
 21  4 involving a schedule IV controlled substance is punishable as
 21  5 an aggravated misdemeanor in Code section 124.401(1)(d).

 15  7    TEMPORARY CONTROLLED SUBSTANCE DESIGNATION.  Under current
 15  8 law and in the bill, the board of pharmacy may designate a new
 15  9 substance as a controlled substance, by administrative rule,
 15 10 without the general assembly amending Code chapter 124, only
 15 11 if the substance is designated as a controlled substance under
 15 12 federal law.
 15 13    If the board of pharmacy designates a substance as
 15 14 controlled, the bill specifies that the temporary designation
 15 15 is considered a temporary amendment to the schedules of
 15 16 controlled substances in Code chapter 124, and if the general
 15 17 assembly does not amend Code chapter 124 to enact the  temporary
 15 18 amendment and make the enactment effective within two years
 15 19 from the date the temporary amendment first became effective,
 15 20 the temporary amendment is repealed by operation of law two
 15 21 years from the effective date of the temporary amendment.  A
 15 22 temporary amendment repealed by operation of law is subject to
 15 23 Code section 4.13 relating to the construction of statutes and
 15 24 the application of a general savings provision.
 15 25    Current law provides that if within 60 days after the next
 15 26 general assembly convenes the general assembly has not made
 15 27 the corresponding changes in Code chapter 124, the temporary
 15 28 designation that the substance is a controlled substance is
 15 29 nullified.
 15 30    COCAINE BASE.  The bill increases the amounts of controlled
 15 31 substances containing cocaine base (crack cocaine) that
 15 32 determine the criminal penalty for certain offenses.  Under
 15 33 the bill, if a person unlawfully manufactures, delivers, or
 15 34 possesses with the intent to deliver a controlled substance
 15 35 containing cocaine base, or unlawfully acts with, enters into
 16  1 a common scheme or design with, or conspires with one or more
 16  2 persons to manufacture, deliver, or possess such a controlled
 16  3 substance, the person commits the following offenses: a class
 16  4 "B" felony punishable by confinement of no more than 50 years
 16  5 and a fine of not more than $1 million if the controlled
 16  6 substance containing cocaine base is more than 125 grams rather
 16  7 than the current 50 grams; a class "B" felony punishable by
 16  8 confinement of no more than 25 years and a fine of not less than
 16  9 $5,000 but not more than $100,000 if the imitation controlled
 16 10 substance is more than 35 grams but not more than 125 grams
 16 11 rather than the current 10 to 50 grams; or a class "C" felony
 16 12 punishable by a fine of not less than $1,000 but not more than
 16 13 $50,000 if the controlled substance containing cocaine base is
 16 14 35 grams or less rather than the current 10 grams or less.
 16 15    IMITATION CONTROLLED SUBSTANCES.  Under current law
 16 16 imitation controlled substances are regulated under Code
 16 17 chapter 124A.  The bill repeals Code chapter 124A and transfers
 16 18 the regulation of imitation controlled substances to Code
 16 19 chapter 124.  The definition and designation of an imitation
 16 20 controlled substance in Code chapter 124 remains identical
 16 21 to the definition and designation of an imitation controlled
 16 22 substance under current law in Code chapter 124A.
 16 23    Under the bill and in current law, an imitation controlled
 16 24 substance means a substance which is not a controlled substance
 16 25 but by color, shape, size, markings, and other aspects of
 16 26 dosage unit appearance, and packaging or other factors, appears
 16 27 to be or resembles a controlled substance. The board of
 16 28 pharmacy may designate a substance as an imitation controlled
 16 29 substance pursuant to the board's rulemaking authority and in
 16 30 accordance with Code chapter 17A.
 16 31    In addition, under current law and in the bill, if a
 16 32 substance has not been designated as an imitation controlled
 16 33 substance by the board of pharmacy and when dosage unit
 16 34 appearance alone does not establish that a substance is an
 16 35 imitation controlled substance, the following factors may
 17  1 be considered in determining whether the substance is an
 17  2 imitation controlled substance: the substance is represented
 17  3 as having the effect of a controlled substance; the substance
 17  4 is represented as a controlled substance or as a substitute for
 17  5 a controlled substance because of its nature or appearance;
 17  6 or a person receives money or other property having a value
 17  7 substantially greater than the actual value of the substance
 17  8 when sold.
 17  9    Under the bill, if a person unlawfully manufactures,
 17 10 delivers, or possesses with the intent to deliver an imitation
 17 11 controlled substance containing any detectable amount of those
 17 12 substances identified in Code section 124.204(9), or unlawfully
 17 13 acts with, enters into a common scheme or design with, or
 17 14 conspires with one or more persons to manufacture, deliver,
 17 15 or possess such imitation controlled substances, the person
 17 16 commits the following offense: a class "B" felony punishable
 17 17 by confinement of no more than 50 years and a fine of not more
 17 18 than $1 million if the imitation controlled substance is more
 17 19 than 10 kilograms; a class "B" felony punishable by confinement
 17 20 of no more than 25 years and a fine of not less than $5,000 but
 17 21 not more than $100,000 if the imitation controlled substance
 17 22 is more than five kilograms but not more than 10 kilograms; a
 17 23 class "C" felony punishable by a fine of not less than $1,000
 17 24 but not more than $50,000 if the imitation controlled substance
 17 25 is five kilograms or less; or an aggravated misdemeanor if the
 17 26 imitation controlled substance is classified in schedule IV or
 17 27 V; or a serious misdemeanor for a first possession offense,
 17 28 an aggravated misdemeanor for a second possession offense,
 17 29 or a class "D" felony for two or more previous possession
 17 30 offenses. Current law in Code section 124A.4 provides that if
 17 31 a person unlawfully manufactures, delivers, or possesses with
 17 32 intent to deliver an imitation controlled substance, the person
 17 33 commits an aggravated misdemeanor, or if the person delivers
 17 34 to a person under 18 years of age who is at least three years
 17 35 younger than the violator, the person commits a class "D"
 18  1 felony.  In addition, under current law, if a person unlawfully
 18  2 and knowingly publishes an advertisement or distributes in a
 18  3 public place a promotion for an imitation controlled substance
 18  4 the person commits a serious misdemeanor.
 18  5    The bill enhances the criminal penalties for controlled
 18  6 substances classified in Code sections 124.204(4)(ai) and
 18  7 124.204(6)(i) from an aggravated misdemeanor to a class "C"
 18  8 felony punishable pursuant to Code section 124.401(1)(c)(8).
 18  9 This change equalizes the criminal penalties with violations
 18 10 involving other schedule I controlled substances.
 18 11    The bill provides that if the same person commits two or
 18 12 more acts which are in violation of Code section 124.401(1)
 18 13 and the acts occur in the same location or time period so the
 18 14 acts are attributable to a single scheme, the acts may be
 18 15 considered a single violation and the weights of the imitation
 18 16 controlled substance may be combined for purposes of charging
 18 17 the offender.
 18 18    The amendment to Code section 124.401A provides that
 18 19 a person who is 18 years of age or older who unlawfully
 18 20 manufactures with the intent to distribute, distributes,
 18 21 or possesses with the intent to distribute an imitation
 18 22 controlled substance to another person 18 years of age or older
 18 23 within 1,000 feet of the real property comprising a public or
 18 24 nonpublic school, may be sentenced up to an additional term of
 18 25 confinement of five years in addition to any other penalty.
 18 26    The amendment to Code section 124.401B provides that
 18 27 a person who unlawfully possesses an imitation controlled
 18 28 substance within 1,000 feet of the real property comprising a
 18 29 school, public park, public pool, public recreation center, or
 18 30 marked school bus may be sentenced up to 100 hours of community
 18 31 service.
 18 32    The amendments to Code section 124.406 relate to the
 18 33 distribution or possession with the intent to distribute an
 18 34 imitation controlled substance to a person under 18 years of
 18 35 age.  A person who distributes or possesses with the intent to
 19  1 distribute an imitation controlled substance, represented to
 19  2 be a substance listed in schedule I or schedule II, to a person
 19  3 under 18 years of age commits a class "B" felony. The required
 19  4 penalty for such a violation is a minimum term of confinement
 19  5 of 10 years if the substance was distributed within 1,000
 19  6 feet of the real property comprising a public or nonpublic
 19  7 school, public park, public pool, or public recreation center.
 19  8 A person who distributes or possesses with the intent to
 19  9 distribute an imitation controlled substance, represented to be
 19 10 a substance listed in schedule III, to a person under 18 years
 19 11 of age, who is at least three years younger than the violator,
 19 12 commits a class "C" felony.  A person who distributes or
 19 13 possesses with the intent to distribute an imitation controlled
 19 14 substance, represented to be a substance listed in schedule
 19 15 IV or schedule V, to a person under 18 years of age, who is
 19 16 at least three years younger than the violator, commits an
 19 17 aggravated misdemeanor.
 19 18    The amendment to Code section 124.415 requires that a peace
 19 19 officer make a reasonable effort to identify a person under 18
 19 20 years of age discovered to be in possession of an imitation
 19 21 controlled substance, and if the person is not referred to
 19 22 juvenile court, the peace officer shall make a reasonable
 19 23 effort to notify the person's custodial parent of the
 19 24 possession unless the officer has reasonable grounds to believe
 19 25 such notification is not in the best interests of the person.
 19 26 The bill specifies that if the person is taken into custody
 19 27 the juvenile court officer shall make a reasonable effort to
 19 28 identify the school of attendance and to notify the school or
 19 29 nonpublic school of the taking into custody of the person.
 19 30    The bill creates Code section 124.417, which is similar to
 19 31 Code section 124A.5 repealed by the bill.  A person registered
 19 32 under Code section 124.302 does not violate the bill if the
 19 33 person manufactures, delivers, possesses, or possesses with the
 19 34 intent to manufacture or deliver, or acts with others to do
 19 35 such activities, if the person uses the imitation controlled
 20  1 substance for use as a placebo by a registered practitioner in
 20  2 the court of professional practice or research.

 20  4 transfers numerous substances classified as "hallucinogenic
 20  5 substances" under schedule I and reclassifies the substances
 20  6 as "other substances" under schedule I.  By transferring the
 20  7 substances to "other substances", a person commits a class "C"
 20  8 felony under Code section 124.401(1)(c)(8) if the violation
 20  9 involves such a substance. Under current law, a person commits

 20 11 committing such violations.
 20 12    The bill adds new substances as "hallucinogenic substances"

 20 14 Code section 124.401(1)(c)(8) if the violation involves the new
 20 15 hallucinogenic substances.
 20 16    The bill adds new substances as "stimulants" under schedule
 20 17 I.  A person commits a class "C" felony under Code section

 20 19 substances.
 20 20    The bill also adds new substances to the classification of

 20 22 "C" felony under Code section 124.401(1)(c)(8) for a violation
 20 23 involving the new substances.
 20 24    The bill strikes one substance classified as a
 20 25 "hallucinogenic substance" under schedule I and reclassifies

 20 29 involving the substance from a class "C" felony under Code
 20 30 section 124.401(1)(c)(8) to an aggravated misdemeanor under

 17  3 as having the effect of a controlled substance; the substance
 17  4 is represented as a controlled substance or as a substitute for
 17  5 a controlled substance because of its nature or appearance;
 17  6 or a person receives money or other property having a value
 17  7 substantially greater than the actual value of the substance
 17  8 when sold.
 17  9    Under the bill, if a person unlawfully manufactures,
 17 10 delivers, or possesses with the intent to deliver an imitation
 17 11 controlled substance containing any detectable amount of those
 17 12 substances identified in Code section 124.204(9), or unlawfully
 17 13 acts with, enters into a common scheme or design with, or
 17 14 conspires with one or more persons to manufacture, deliver,
 17 15 or possess such imitation controlled substances, the person
 17 16 commits the following offense: a class "B" felony punishable
 17 17 by confinement of no more than 50 years and a fine of not more
 17 18 than $1 million if the imitation controlled substance is more
 17 19 than 10 kilograms; a class "B" felony punishable by confinement
 17 20 of no more than 25 years and a fine of not less than $5,000 but
 17 21 not more than $100,000 if the imitation controlled substance
 17 22 is more than five kilograms but not more than 10 kilograms; a
 17 23 class "C" felony punishable by a fine of not less than $1,000
 17 24 but not more than $50,000 if the imitation controlled substance
 17 25 is five kilograms or less; or an aggravated misdemeanor if the
 17 26 imitation controlled substance is classified in schedule IV or
 17 27 V; or a serious misdemeanor for a first possession offense,
 17 28 an aggravated misdemeanor for a second possession offense,
 17 29 or a class "D" felony for two or more previous possession
 17 30 offenses. Current law in Code section 124A.4 provides that if
 17 31 a person unlawfully manufactures, delivers, or possesses with
 17 32 intent to deliver an imitation controlled substance, the person
 17 33 commits an aggravated misdemeanor, or if the person delivers
 17 34 to a person under 18 years of age who is at least three years
 17 35 younger than the violator, the person commits a class "D"
 18  1 felony.  In addition, under current law, if a person unlawfully
 18  2 and knowingly publishes an advertisement or distributes in a
 18  3 public place a promotion for an imitation controlled substance
 18  4 the person commits a serious misdemeanor.
 18  5    The bill enhances the criminal penalties for controlled
 18  6 substances classified in Code sections 124.204(4)(ai) and
 18  7 124.204(6)(i) from an aggravated misdemeanor to a class "C"
 18  8 felony punishable pursuant to Code section 124.401(1)(c)(8).
 18  9 This change equalizes the criminal penalties with violations
 18 10 involving other schedule I controlled substances.
 18 11    The bill provides that if the same person commits two or
 18 12 more acts which are in violation of Code section 124.401(1)
 18 13 and the acts occur in the same location or time period so the
 18 14 acts are attributable to a single scheme, the acts may be
 18 15 considered a single violation and the weights of the imitation
 18 16 controlled substance may be combined for purposes of charging
 18 17 the offender.
 18 18    The amendment to Code section 124.401A provides that
 18 19 a person who is 18 years of age or older who unlawfully
 18 20 manufactures with the intent to distribute, distributes,
 18 21 or possesses with the intent to distribute an imitation
 18 22 controlled substance to another person 18 years of age or older
 18 23 within 1,000 feet of the real property comprising a public or
 18 24 nonpublic school, may be sentenced up to an additional term of
 18 25 confinement of five years in addition to any other penalty.
 18 26    The amendment to Code section 124.401B provides that
 18 27 a person who unlawfully possesses an imitation controlled
 18 28 substance within 1,000 feet of the real property comprising a
 18 29 school, public park, public pool, public recreation center, or
 18 30 marked school bus may be sentenced up to 100 hours of community
 18 31 service.
 18 32    The amendments to Code section 124.406 relate to the
 18 33 distribution or possession with the intent to distribute an
 18 34 imitation controlled substance to a person under 18 years of
 18 35 age.  A person who distributes or possesses with the intent to
 19  1 distribute an imitation controlled substance, represented to
 19  2 be a substance listed in schedule I or schedule II, to a person
 19  3 under 18 years of age commits a class "B" felony. The required
 19  4 penalty for such a violation is a minimum term of confinement
 19  5 of 10 years if the substance was distributed within 1,000
 19  6 feet of the real property comprising a public or nonpublic
 19  7 school, public park, public pool, or public recreation center.
 19  8 A person who distributes or possesses with the intent to
 19  9 distribute an imitation controlled substance, represented to be
 19 10 a substance listed in schedule III, to a person under 18 years
 19 11 of age, who is at least three years younger than the violator,
 19 12 commits a class "C" felony.  A person who distributes or
 19 13 possesses with the intent to distribute an imitation controlled
 19 14 substance, represented to be a substance listed in schedule
 19 15 IV or schedule V, to a person under 18 years of age, who is
 19 16 at least three years younger than the violator, commits an
 19 17 aggravated misdemeanor.
 19 18    The amendment to Code section 124.415 requires that a peace
 19 19 officer make a reasonable effort to identify a person under 18
 19 20 years of age discovered to be in possession of an imitation
 19 21 controlled substance, and if the person is not referred to
 19 22 juvenile court, the peace officer shall make a reasonable
 19 23 effort to notify the person's custodial parent of the
 19 24 possession unless the officer has reasonable grounds to believe
 19 25 such notification is not in the best interests of the person.
 19 26 The bill specifies that if the person is taken into custody
 19 27 the juvenile court officer shall make a reasonable effort to
 19 28 identify the school of attendance and to notify the school or
 19 29 nonpublic school of the taking into custody of the person.
 19 30    The bill creates Code section 124.417, which is similar to
 19 31 Code section 124A.5 repealed by the bill.  A person registered
 19 32 under Code section 124.302 does not violate the bill if the
 19 33 person manufactures, delivers, possesses, or possesses with the
 19 34 intent to manufacture or deliver, or acts with others to do
 19 35 such activities, if the person uses the imitation controlled
 20  1 substance for use as a placebo by a registered practitioner in
 20  2 the court of professional practice or research.
 20  3    SCHEDULE I, III, AND IV CONTROLLED SUBSTANCES.  The bill
 20  4 transfers numerous substances classified as "hallucinogenic
 20  5 substances" under schedule I and reclassifies the substances
 20  6 as "other substances" under schedule I.  By transferring the
 20  7 substances to "other substances", a person commits a class "C"
 20  8 felony under Code section 124.401(1)(c)(8) if the violation
 20  9 involves such a substance. Under current law, a person commits
 20 10 an aggravated misdemeanor under Code section 124.401(1)(d) when
 20 11 committing such violations.
 20 12    The bill adds new substances as "hallucinogenic substances"
 20 13 under schedule I.  A person commits a class "C" felony under
 20 14 Code section 124.401(1)(c)(8) if the violation involves the new
 20 15 hallucinogenic substances.
 20 16    The bill adds new substances as "stimulants" under schedule
 20 17 I.  A person commits a class "C" felony under Code section
 20 18 124.401(1)(c)(8) if the violation involves the new stimulant
 20 19 substances.
 20 20    The bill also adds new substances to the classification of
 20 21 "other substances" under schedule I.  A person commits a class
 20 22 "C" felony under Code section 124.401(1)(c)(8) for a violation
 20 23 involving the new substances.
 20 24    The bill strikes one substance classified as a
 20 25 "hallucinogenic substance" under schedule I and reclassifies
 20 26 the substance as a "stimulant" containing a synthetic cathinone
 20 27 under schedule I.  The transfer of the substance within
 20 28 schedule I also changes the criminal penalty for a violation
 20 29 involving the substance from a class "C" felony under Code
 20 30 section 124.401(1)(c)(8) to an aggravated misdemeanor under
 20 31 Code section 124.401(1)(d).  The bill also strikes a substance
 20 32 in Code section 124.204(6)(i)(3) from schedule I and does not
 20 33 reclassify the substance in any other substance schedule.
 20 34    The bill also removes numerous substances from schedule I
 20 35 which are currently classified as "stimulants" in Code section
 21  1 124.204(6)(i).
 21  2    The bill also strikes two narcotic substances from schedule
 21  3 III and adds three substances to schedule IV.  A violation
 21  4 involving a schedule IV controlled substance is punishable as
 21  5 an aggravated misdemeanor in Code section 124.401(1)(d).

 15  9 substance as a controlled substance, by administrative rule,
 15 10 without the general assembly amending Code chapter 124, only
 15 11 if the substance is designated as a controlled substance under
 15 12 federal law.
 15 13    If the board of pharmacy designates a substance as
 15 14 controlled, the bill specifies that the temporary designation
 15 15 is considered a temporary amendment to the schedules of
 15 16 controlled substances in Code chapter 124, and if the general
 15 17 assembly does not amend Code chapter 124 to enact the  temporary
 15 18 amendment and make the enactment effective within two years
 15 19 from the date the temporary amendment first became effective,
 15 20 the temporary amendment is repealed by operation of law two
 15 21 years from the effective date of the temporary amendment.  A
 15 22 temporary amendment repealed by operation of law is subject to
 15 23 Code section 4.13 relating to the construction of statutes and
 15 24 the application of a general savings provision.
 15 25    Current law provides that if within 60 days after the next
 15 26 general assembly convenes the general assembly has not made
 15 27 the corresponding changes in Code chapter 124, the temporary
 15 28 designation that the substance is a controlled substance is
 15 29 nullified.
 15 30    COCAINE BASE.  The bill increases the amounts of controlled
 15 31 substances containing cocaine base (crack cocaine) that
 15 32 determine the criminal penalty for certain offenses.  Under
 15 33 the bill, if a person unlawfully manufactures, delivers, or
 15 34 possesses with the intent to deliver a controlled substance
 15 35 containing cocaine base, or unlawfully acts with, enters into
 16  1 a common scheme or design with, or conspires with one or more
 16  2 persons to manufacture, deliver, or possess such a controlled
 16  3 substance, the person commits the following offenses: a class
 16  4 "B" felony punishable by confinement of no more than 50 years
 16  5 and a fine of not more than $1 million if the controlled
 16  6 substance containing cocaine base is more than 125 grams rather
 16  7 than the current 50 grams; a class "B" felony punishable by
 16  8 confinement of no more than 25 years and a fine of not less than
 16  9 $5,000 but not more than $100,000 if the imitation controlled
 16 10 substance is more than 35 grams but not more than 125 grams
 16 11 rather than the current 10 to 50 grams; or a class "C" felony
 16 12 punishable by a fine of not less than $1,000 but not more than
 16 13 $50,000 if the controlled substance containing cocaine base is
 16 14 35 grams or less rather than the current 10 grams or less.
 16 15    IMITATION CONTROLLED SUBSTANCES.  Under current law
 16 16 imitation controlled substances are regulated under Code
 16 17 chapter 124A.  The bill repeals Code chapter 124A and transfers
 16 18 the regulation of imitation controlled substances to Code
 16 19 chapter 124.  The definition and designation of an imitation
 16 20 controlled substance in Code chapter 124 remains identical
 16 21 to the definition and designation of an imitation controlled
 16 22 substance under current law in Code chapter 124A.
 16 23    Under the bill and in current law, an imitation controlled
 16 24 substance means a substance which is not a controlled substance
 16 25 but by color, shape, size, markings, and other aspects of
 16 26 dosage unit appearance, and packaging or other factors, appears
 16 27 to be or resembles a controlled substance. The board of
 16 28 pharmacy may designate a substance as an imitation controlled
 16 29 substance pursuant to the board's rulemaking authority and in
 16 30 accordance with Code chapter 17A.
 16 31    In addition, under current law and in the bill, if a
 16 32 substance has not been designated as an imitation controlled
 16 33 substance by the board of pharmacy and when dosage unit
 16 34 appearance alone does not establish that a substance is an
 16 35 imitation controlled substance, the following factors may
 17  1 be considered in determining whether the substance is an
 17  2 imitation controlled substance: the substance is represented
 17  3 as having the effect of a controlled substance; the substance
 17  4 is represented as a controlled substance or as a substitute for
 17  5 a controlled substance because of its nature or appearance;
 17  6 or a person receives money or other property having a value
 17  7 substantially greater than the actual value of the substance
 17  8 when sold.
 17  9    Under the bill, if a person unlawfully manufactures,
 17 10 delivers, or possesses with the intent to deliver an imitation
 17 11 controlled substance containing any detectable amount of those
 17 12 substances identified in Code section 124.204(9), or unlawfully
 17 13 acts with, enters into a common scheme or design with, or
 17 14 conspires with one or more persons to manufacture, deliver,
 17 15 or possess such imitation controlled substances, the person
 17 16 commits the following offense: a class "B" felony punishable
 17 17 by confinement of no more than 50 years and a fine of not more
 17 18 than $1 million if the imitation controlled substance is more
 17 19 than 10 kilograms; a class "B" felony punishable by confinement
 17 20 of no more than 25 years and a fine of not less than $5,000 but
 17 21 not more than $100,000 if the imitation controlled substance
 17 22 is more than five kilograms but not more than 10 kilograms; a
 17 23 class "C" felony punishable by a fine of not less than $1,000
 17 24 but not more than $50,000 if the imitation controlled substance
 17 25 is five kilograms or less; or an aggravated misdemeanor if the
 17 26 imitation controlled substance is classified in schedule IV or
 17 27 V; or a serious misdemeanor for a first possession offense,
 17 28 an aggravated misdemeanor for a second possession offense,
 17 29 or a class "D" felony for two or more previous possession
 17 30 offenses. Current law in Code section 124A.4 provides that if
 17 31 a person unlawfully manufactures, delivers, or possesses with
 17 32 intent to deliver an imitation controlled substance, the person
 17 33 commits an aggravated misdemeanor, or if the person delivers
 17 34 to a person under 18 years of age who is at least three years
 17 35 younger than the violator, the person commits a class "D"
 18  1 felony.  In addition, under current law, if a person unlawfully
 18  2 and knowingly publishes an advertisement or distributes in a
 18  3 public place a promotion for an imitation controlled substance
 18  4 the person commits a serious misdemeanor.
 18  5    The bill enhances the criminal penalties for controlled
 18  6 substances classified in Code sections 124.204(4)(ai) and
 18  7 124.204(6)(i) from an aggravated misdemeanor to a class "C"
 18  8 felony punishable pursuant to Code section 124.401(1)(c)(8).
 18  9 This change equalizes the criminal penalties with violations
 18 10 involving other schedule I controlled substances.
 18 11    The bill provides that if the same person commits two or
 18 12 more acts which are in violation of Code section 124.401(1)
 18 13 and the acts occur in the same location or time period so the
 18 14 acts are attributable to a single scheme, the acts may be
 18 15 considered a single violation and the weights of the imitation
 18 16 controlled substance may be combined for purposes of charging
 18 17 the offender.
 18 18    The amendment to Code section 124.401A provides that
 18 19 a person who is 18 years of age or older who unlawfully
 18 20 manufactures with the intent to distribute, distributes,
 18 21 or possesses with the intent to distribute an imitation
 18 22 controlled substance to another person 18 years of age or older
 18 23 within 1,000 feet of the real property comprising a public or
 18 24 nonpublic school, may be sentenced up to an additional term of
 18 25 confinement of five years in addition to any other penalty.
 18 26    The amendment to Code section 124.401B provides that
 18 27 a person who unlawfully possesses an imitation controlled
 18 28 substance within 1,000 feet of the real property comprising a
 18 29 school, public park, public pool, public recreation center, or
 18 30 marked school bus may be sentenced up to 100 hours of community
 18 31 service.
 18 32    The amendments to Code section 124.406 relate to the
 18 33 distribution or possession with the intent to distribute an
 18 34 imitation controlled substance to a person under 18 years of
 18 35 age.  A person who distributes or possesses with the intent to
 19  1 distribute an imitation controlled substance, represented to
 19  2 be a substance listed in schedule I or schedule II, to a person
 19  3 under 18 years of age commits a class "B" felony. The required
 19  4 penalty for such a violation is a minimum term of confinement
 19  5 of 10 years if the substance was distributed within 1,000
 19  6 feet of the real property comprising a public or nonpublic
 19  7 school, public park, public pool, or public recreation center.
 19  8 A person who distributes or possesses with the intent to
 19  9 distribute an imitation controlled substance, represented to be
 19 10 a substance listed in schedule III, to a person under 18 years
 19 11 of age, who is at least three years younger than the violator,
 19 12 commits a class "C" felony.  A person who distributes or
 19 13 possesses with the intent to distribute an imitation controlled
 19 14 substance, represented to be a substance listed in schedule
 19 15 IV or schedule V, to a person under 18 years of age, who is
 19 16 at least three years younger than the violator, commits an
 19 17 aggravated misdemeanor.
 19 18    The amendment to Code section 124.415 requires that a peace
 19 19 officer make a reasonable effort to identify a person under 18
 19 20 years of age discovered to be in possession of an imitation
 19 21 controlled substance, and if the person is not referred to
 19 22 juvenile court, the peace officer shall make a reasonable
 19 23 effort to notify the person's custodial parent of the
 19 24 possession unless the officer has reasonable grounds to believe
 19 25 such notification is not in the best interests of the person.
 19 26 The bill specifies that if the person is taken into custody
 19 27 the juvenile court officer shall make a reasonable effort to
 19 28 identify the school of attendance and to notify the school or
 19 29 nonpublic school of the taking into custody of the person.
 19 30    The bill creates Code section 124.417, which is similar to
 19 31 Code section 124A.5 repealed by the bill.  A person registered
 19 32 under Code section 124.302 does not violate the bill if the
 19 33 person manufactures, delivers, possesses, or possesses with the
 19 34 intent to manufacture or deliver, or acts with others to do
 19 35 such activities, if the person uses the imitation controlled
 20  1 substance for use as a placebo by a registered practitioner in
 20  2 the court of professional practice or research.
 20  3    SCHEDULE I, III, AND IV CONTROLLED SUBSTANCES.  The bill
 20  4 transfers numerous substances classified as "hallucinogenic
 20  5 substances" under schedule I and reclassifies the substances
 20  6 as "other substances" under schedule I.  By transferring the
 20  7 substances to "other substances", a person commits a class "C"
 20  8 felony under Code section 124.401(1)(c)(8) if the violation
 20  9 involves such a substance. Under current law, a person commits
 20 10 an aggravated misdemeanor under Code section 124.401(1)(d) when
 20 11 committing such violations.
 20 12    The bill adds new substances as "hallucinogenic substances"
 20 13 under schedule I.  A person commits a class "C" felony under
 20 14 Code section 124.401(1)(c)(8) if the violation involves the new
 20 15 hallucinogenic substances.
 20 16    The bill adds new substances as "stimulants" under schedule
 20 17 I.  A person commits a class "C" felony under Code section
 20 18 124.401(1)(c)(8) if the violation involves the new stimulant
 20 19 substances.
 20 20    The bill also adds new substances to the classification of
 20 21 "other substances" under schedule I.  A person commits a class
 20 22 "C" felony under Code section 124.401(1)(c)(8) for a violation
 20 23 involving the new substances.
 20 24    The bill strikes one substance classified as a
 20 25 "hallucinogenic substance" under schedule I and reclassifies
 20 26 the substance as a "stimulant" containing a synthetic cathinone
 20 27 under schedule I.  The transfer of the substance within
 20 28 schedule I also changes the criminal penalty for a violation
 20 29 involving the substance from a class "C" felony under Code
 20 30 section 124.401(1)(c)(8) to an aggravated misdemeanor under
 20 31 Code section 124.401(1)(d).  The bill also strikes a substance
 20 32 in Code section 124.204(6)(i)(3) from schedule I and does not
 20 33 reclassify the substance in any other substance schedule.
 20 34    The bill also removes numerous substances from schedule I

 15 35 containing cocaine base, or unlawfully acts with, enters into
 16  1 a common scheme or design with, or conspires with one or more

 16 15    IMITATION CONTROLLED SUBSTANCES.  Under current law
 16 16 imitation controlled substances are regulated under Code
 16 17 chapter 124A.  The bill repeals Code chapter 124A and transfers
 16 18 the regulation of imitation controlled substances to Code
 16 19 chapter 124.  The definition and designation of an imitation
 16 20 controlled substance in Code chapter 124 remains identical
 16 21 to the definition and designation of an imitation controlled
 16 22 substance under current law in Code chapter 124A.
 16 23    Under the bill and in current law, an imitation controlled
 16 24 substance means a substance which is not a controlled substance
 16 25 but by color, shape, size, markings, and other aspects of
 16 26 dosage unit appearance, and packaging or other factors, appears
 16 27 to be or resembles a controlled substance. The board of
 16 28 pharmacy may designate a substance as an imitation controlled
 16 29 substance pursuant to the board's rulemaking authority and in
 16 30 accordance with Code chapter 17A.
 16 31    In addition, under current law and in the bill, if a
 16 32 substance has not been designated as an imitation controlled
 16 33 substance by the board of pharmacy and when dosage unit
 16 34 appearance alone does not establish that a substance is an
 16 35 imitation controlled substance, the following factors may
 17  1 be considered in determining whether the substance is an
 17  2 imitation controlled substance: the substance is represented
 17  3 as having the effect of a controlled substance; the substance
 17  4 is represented as a controlled substance or as a substitute for
 17  5 a controlled substance because of its nature or appearance;
 17  6 or a person receives money or other property having a value
 17  7 substantially greater than the actual value of the substance
 17  8 when sold.
 17  9    Under the bill, if a person unlawfully manufactures,
 17 10 delivers, or possesses with the intent to deliver an imitation
 17 11 controlled substance containing any detectable amount of those
 17 12 substances identified in Code section 124.204(9), or unlawfully
 17 13 acts with, enters into a common scheme or design with, or
 17 14 conspires with one or more persons to manufacture, deliver,
 17 15 or possess such imitation controlled substances, the person
 17 16 commits the following offense: a class "B" felony punishable
 17 17 by confinement of no more than 50 years and a fine of not more
 17 18 than $1 million if the imitation controlled substance is more
 17 19 than 10 kilograms; a class "B" felony punishable by confinement
 17 20 of no more than 25 years and a fine of not less than $5,000 but
 17 21 not more than $100,000 if the imitation controlled substance
 17 22 is more than five kilograms but not more than 10 kilograms; a
 17 23 class "C" felony punishable by a fine of not less than $1,000
 17 24 but not more than $50,000 if the imitation controlled substance
 17 25 is five kilograms or less; or an aggravated misdemeanor if the
 17 26 imitation controlled substance is classified in schedule IV or
 17 27 V; or a serious misdemeanor for a first possession offense,
 17 28 an aggravated misdemeanor for a second possession offense,
 17 29 or a class "D" felony for two or more previous possession
 17 30 offenses. Current law in Code section 124A.4 provides that if
 17 31 a person unlawfully manufactures, delivers, or possesses with
 17 32 intent to deliver an imitation controlled substance, the person
 17 33 commits an aggravated misdemeanor, or if the person delivers
 17 34 to a person under 18 years of age who is at least three years
 17 35 younger than the violator, the person commits a class "D"
 18  1 felony.  In addition, under current law, if a person unlawfully
 18  2 and knowingly publishes an advertisement or distributes in a
 18  3 public place a promotion for an imitation controlled substance
 18  4 the person commits a serious misdemeanor.
 18  5    The bill enhances the criminal penalties for controlled
 18  6 substances classified in Code sections 124.204(4)(ai) and
 18  7 124.204(6)(i) from an aggravated misdemeanor to a class "C"
 18  8 felony punishable pursuant to Code section 124.401(1)(c)(8).
 18  9 This change equalizes the criminal penalties with violations
 18 10 involving other schedule I controlled substances.
 18 11    The bill provides that if the same person commits two or
 18 12 more acts which are in violation of Code section 124.401(1)
 18 13 and the acts occur in the same location or time period so the
 18 14 acts are attributable to a single scheme, the acts may be
 18 15 considered a single violation and the weights of the imitation
 18 16 controlled substance may be combined for purposes of charging
 18 17 the offender.
 18 18    The amendment to Code section 124.401A provides that
 18 19 a person who is 18 years of age or older who unlawfully
 18 20 manufactures with the intent to distribute, distributes,
 18 21 or possesses with the intent to distribute an imitation
 18 22 controlled substance to another person 18 years of age or older
 18 23 within 1,000 feet of the real property comprising a public or
 18 24 nonpublic school, may be sentenced up to an additional term of
 18 25 confinement of five years in addition to any other penalty.
 18 26    The amendment to Code section 124.401B provides that
 18 27 a person who unlawfully possesses an imitation controlled
 18 28 substance within 1,000 feet of the real property comprising a
 18 29 school, public park, public pool, public recreation center, or
 18 30 marked school bus may be sentenced up to 100 hours of community
 18 31 service.
 18 32    The amendments to Code section 124.406 relate to the
 18 33 distribution or possession with the intent to distribute an
 18 34 imitation controlled substance to a person under 18 years of
 18 35 age.  A person who distributes or possesses with the intent to
 19  1 distribute an imitation controlled substance, represented to
 19  2 be a substance listed in schedule I or schedule II, to a person
 19  3 under 18 years of age commits a class "B" felony. The required
 19  4 penalty for such a violation is a minimum term of confinement
 19  5 of 10 years if the substance was distributed within 1,000
 19  6 feet of the real property comprising a public or nonpublic
 19  7 school, public park, public pool, or public recreation center.
 19  8 A person who distributes or possesses with the intent to
 19  9 distribute an imitation controlled substance, represented to be
 19 10 a substance listed in schedule III, to a person under 18 years
 19 11 of age, who is at least three years younger than the violator,
 19 12 commits a class "C" felony.  A person who distributes or
 19 13 possesses with the intent to distribute an imitation controlled
 19 14 substance, represented to be a substance listed in schedule
 19 15 IV or schedule V, to a person under 18 years of age, who is
 19 16 at least three years younger than the violator, commits an
 19 17 aggravated misdemeanor.
 19 18    The amendment to Code section 124.415 requires that a peace
 19 19 officer make a reasonable effort to identify a person under 18
 19 20 years of age discovered to be in possession of an imitation
 19 21 controlled substance, and if the person is not referred to
 19 22 juvenile court, the peace officer shall make a reasonable
 19 23 effort to notify the person's custodial parent of the
 19 24 possession unless the officer has reasonable grounds to believe
 19 25 such notification is not in the best interests of the person.
 19 26 The bill specifies that if the person is taken into custody
 19 27 the juvenile court officer shall make a reasonable effort to
 19 28 identify the school of attendance and to notify the school or
 19 29 nonpublic school of the taking into custody of the person.
 19 30    The bill creates Code section 124.417, which is similar to
 19 31 Code section 124A.5 repealed by the bill.  A person registered
 19 32 under Code section 124.302 does not violate the bill if the
 19 33 person manufactures, delivers, possesses, or possesses with the
 19 34 intent to manufacture or deliver, or acts with others to do
 19 35 such activities, if the person uses the imitation controlled
 20  1 substance for use as a placebo by a registered practitioner in
 20  2 the court of professional practice or research.
 20  3    SCHEDULE I, III, AND IV CONTROLLED SUBSTANCES.  The bill
 20  4 transfers numerous substances classified as "hallucinogenic
 20  5 substances" under schedule I and reclassifies the substances
 20  6 as "other substances" under schedule I.  By transferring the
 20  7 substances to "other substances", a person commits a class "C"
 20  8 felony under Code section 124.401(1)(c)(8) if the violation
 20  9 involves such a substance. Under current law, a person commits
 20 10 an aggravated misdemeanor under Code section 124.401(1)(d) when
 20 11 committing such violations.
 20 12    The bill adds new substances as "hallucinogenic substances"
 20 13 under schedule I.  A person commits a class "C" felony under
 20 14 Code section 124.401(1)(c)(8) if the violation involves the new
 20 15 hallucinogenic substances.
 20 16    The bill adds new substances as "stimulants" under schedule
 20 17 I.  A person commits a class "C" felony under Code section
 20 18 124.401(1)(c)(8) if the violation involves the new stimulant
 20 19 substances.
 20 20    The bill also adds new substances to the classification of
 20 21 "other substances" under schedule I.  A person commits a class
 20 22 "C" felony under Code section 124.401(1)(c)(8) for a violation
 20 23 involving the new substances.
 20 24    The bill strikes one substance classified as a
 20 25 "hallucinogenic substance" under schedule I and reclassifies
 20 26 the substance as a "stimulant" containing a synthetic cathinone
 20 27 under schedule I.  The transfer of the substance within
 20 28 schedule I also changes the criminal penalty for a violation
 20 29 involving the substance from a class "C" felony under Code
 20 30 section 124.401(1)(c)(8) to an aggravated misdemeanor under
 20 31 Code section 124.401(1)(d).  The bill also strikes a substance
 20 32 in Code section 124.204(6)(i)(3) from schedule I and does not
 20 33 reclassify the substance in any other substance schedule.
 20 34    The bill also removes numerous substances from schedule I
 20 35 which are currently classified as "stimulants" in Code section
 21  1 124.204(6)(i).
 21  2    The bill also strikes two narcotic substances from schedule
 21  3 III and adds three substances to schedule IV.  A violation
 21  4 involving a schedule IV controlled substance is punishable as
 21  5 an aggravated misdemeanor in Code section 124.401(1)(d).

 15 11 if the substance is designated as a controlled substance under
 15 12 federal law.
 15 13    If the board of pharmacy designates a substance as
 15 14 controlled, the bill specifies that the temporary designation
 15 15 is considered a temporary amendment to the schedules of
 15 16 controlled substances in Code chapter 124, and if the general
 15 17 assembly does not amend Code chapter 124 to enact the  temporary
 15 18 amendment and make the enactment effective within two years
 15 19 from the date the temporary amendment first became effective,
 15 20 the temporary amendment is repealed by operation of law two
 15 21 years from the effective date of the temporary amendment.  A
 15 22 temporary amendment repealed by operation of law is subject to
 15 23 Code section 4.13 relating to the construction of statutes and
 15 24 the application of a general savings provision.
 15 25    Current law provides that if within 60 days after the next
 15 26 general assembly convenes the general assembly has not made
 15 27 the corresponding changes in Code chapter 124, the temporary
 15 28 designation that the substance is a controlled substance is
 15 29 nullified.
 15 30    COCAINE BASE.  The bill increases the amounts of controlled
 15 31 substances containing cocaine base (crack cocaine) that
 15 32 determine the criminal penalty for certain offenses.  Under
 15 33 the bill, if a person unlawfully manufactures, delivers, or
 15 34 possesses with the intent to deliver a controlled substance
 15 35 containing cocaine base, or unlawfully acts with, enters into
 16  1 a common scheme or design with, or conspires with one or more
 16  2 persons to manufacture, deliver, or possess such a controlled
 16  3 substance, the person commits the following offenses: a class
 16  4 "B" felony punishable by confinement of no more than 50 years
 16  5 and a fine of not more than $1 million if the controlled
 16  6 substance containing cocaine base is more than 125 grams rather
 16  7 than the current 50 grams; a class "B" felony punishable by
 16  8 confinement of no more than 25 years and a fine of not less than
 16  9 $5,000 but not more than $100,000 if the imitation controlled
 16 10 substance is more than 35 grams but not more than 125 grams
 16 11 rather than the current 10 to 50 grams; or a class "C" felony
 16 12 punishable by a fine of not less than $1,000 but not more than
 16 13 $50,000 if the controlled substance containing cocaine base is
 16 14 35 grams or less rather than the current 10 grams or less.
 16 15    IMITATION CONTROLLED SUBSTANCES.  Under current law
 16 16 imitation controlled substances are regulated under Code
 16 17 chapter 124A.  The bill repeals Code chapter 124A and transfers
 16 18 the regulation of imitation controlled substances to Code
 16 19 chapter 124.  The definition and designation of an imitation
 16 20 controlled substance in Code chapter 124 remains identical
 16 21 to the definition and designation of an imitation controlled
 16 22 substance under current law in Code chapter 124A.
 16 23    Under the bill and in current law, an imitation controlled
 16 24 substance means a substance which is not a controlled substance
 16 25 but by color, shape, size, markings, and other aspects of
 16 26 dosage unit appearance, and packaging or other factors, appears
 16 27 to be or resembles a controlled substance. The board of
 16 28 pharmacy may designate a substance as an imitation controlled
 16 29 substance pursuant to the board's rulemaking authority and in
 16 30 accordance with Code chapter 17A.
 16 31    In addition, under current law and in the bill, if a
 16 32 substance has not been designated as an imitation controlled
 16 33 substance by the board of pharmacy and when dosage unit
 16 34 appearance alone does not establish that a substance is an
 16 35 imitation controlled substance, the following factors may
 17  1 be considered in determining whether the substance is an
 17  2 imitation controlled substance: the substance is represented
 17  3 as having the effect of a controlled substance; the substance
 17  4 is represented as a controlled substance or as a substitute for
 17  5 a controlled substance because of its nature or appearance;
 17  6 or a person receives money or other property having a value
 17  7 substantially greater than the actual value of the substance
 17  8 when sold.
 17  9    Under the bill, if a person unlawfully manufactures,
 17 10 delivers, or possesses with the intent to deliver an imitation
 17 11 controlled substance containing any detectable amount of those
 17 12 substances identified in Code section 124.204(9), or unlawfully
 17 13 acts with, enters into a common scheme or design with, or
 17 14 conspires with one or more persons to manufacture, deliver,
 17 15 or possess such imitation controlled substances, the person
 17 16 commits the following offense: a class "B" felony punishable
 17 17 by confinement of no more than 50 years and a fine of not more
 17 18 than $1 million if the imitation controlled substance is more
 17 19 than 10 kilograms; a class "B" felony punishable by confinement
 17 20 of no more than 25 years and a fine of not less than $5,000 but
 17 21 not more than $100,000 if the imitation controlled substance
 17 22 is more than five kilograms but not more than 10 kilograms; a
 17 23 class "C" felony punishable by a fine of not less than $1,000
 17 24 but not more than $50,000 if the imitation controlled substance
 17 25 is five kilograms or less; or an aggravated misdemeanor if the
 17 26 imitation controlled substance is classified in schedule IV or
 17 27 V; or a serious misdemeanor for a first possession offense,
 17 28 an aggravated misdemeanor for a second possession offense,
 17 29 or a class "D" felony for two or more previous possession
 17 30 offenses. Current law in Code section 124A.4 provides that if
 17 31 a person unlawfully manufactures, delivers, or possesses with
 17 32 intent to deliver an imitation controlled substance, the person
 17 33 commits an aggravated misdemeanor, or if the person delivers
 17 34 to a person under 18 years of age who is at least three years
 17 35 younger than the violator, the person commits a class "D"
 18  1 felony.  In addition, under current law, if a person unlawfully
 18  2 and knowingly publishes an advertisement or distributes in a
 18  3 public place a promotion for an imitation controlled substance
 18  4 the person commits a serious misdemeanor.
 18  5    The bill enhances the criminal penalties for controlled
 18  6 substances classified in Code sections 124.204(4)(ai) and
 18  7 124.204(6)(i) from an aggravated misdemeanor to a class "C"
 18  8 felony punishable pursuant to Code section 124.401(1)(c)(8).
 18  9 This change equalizes the criminal penalties with violations
 18 10 involving other schedule I controlled substances.
 18 11    The bill provides that if the same person commits two or
 18 12 more acts which are in violation of Code section 124.401(1)
 18 13 and the acts occur in the same location or time period so the
 18 14 acts are attributable to a single scheme, the acts may be
 18 15 considered a single violation and the weights of the imitation
 18 16 controlled substance may be combined for purposes of charging
 18 17 the offender.
 18 18    The amendment to Code section 124.401A provides that
 18 19 a person who is 18 years of age or older who unlawfully
 18 20 manufactures with the intent to distribute, distributes,
 18 21 or possesses with the intent to distribute an imitation
 18 22 controlled substance to another person 18 years of age or older
 18 23 within 1,000 feet of the real property comprising a public or
 18 24 nonpublic school, may be sentenced up to an additional term of
 18 25 confinement of five years in addition to any other penalty.
 18 26    The amendment to Code section 124.401B provides that
 18 27 a person who unlawfully possesses an imitation controlled
 18 28 substance within 1,000 feet of the real property comprising a
 18 29 school, public park, public pool, public recreation center, or
 18 30 marked school bus may be sentenced up to 100 hours of community
 18 31 service.
 18 32    The amendments to Code section 124.406 relate to the
 18 33 distribution or possession with the intent to distribute an
 18 34 imitation controlled substance to a person under 18 years of
 18 35 age.  A person who distributes or possesses with the intent to
 19  1 distribute an imitation controlled substance, represented to
 19  2 be a substance listed in schedule I or schedule II, to a person
 19  3 under 18 years of age commits a class "B" felony. The required
 19  4 penalty for such a violation is a minimum term of confinement
 19  5 of 10 years if the substance was distributed within 1,000
 19  6 feet of the real property comprising a public or nonpublic
 19  7 school, public park, public pool, or public recreation center.
 19  8 A person who distributes or possesses with the intent to
 19  9 distribute an imitation controlled substance, represented to be
 19 10 a substance listed in schedule III, to a person under 18 years
 19 11 of age, who is at least three years younger than the violator,
 19 12 commits a class "C" felony.  A person who distributes or
 19 13 possesses with the intent to distribute an imitation controlled
 19 14 substance, represented to be a substance listed in schedule
 19 15 IV or schedule V, to a person under 18 years of age, who is
 19 16 at least three years younger than the violator, commits an
 19 17 aggravated misdemeanor.
 19 18    The amendment to Code section 124.415 requires that a peace
 19 19 officer make a reasonable effort to identify a person under 18
 19 20 years of age discovered to be in possession of an imitation
 19 21 controlled substance, and if the person is not referred to
 19 22 juvenile court, the peace officer shall make a reasonable
 19 23 effort to notify the person's custodial parent of the
 19 24 possession unless the officer has reasonable grounds to believe
 19 25 such notification is not in the best interests of the person.
 19 26 The bill specifies that if the person is taken into custody
 19 27 the juvenile court officer shall make a reasonable effort to
 19 28 identify the school of attendance and to notify the school or
 19 29 nonpublic school of the taking into custody of the person.
 19 30    The bill creates Code section 124.417, which is similar to
 19 31 Code section 124A.5 repealed by the bill.  A person registered
 19 32 under Code section 124.302 does not violate the bill if the
 19 33 person manufactures, delivers, possesses, or possesses with the
 19 34 intent to manufacture or deliver, or acts with others to do
 19 35 such activities, if the person uses the imitation controlled
 20  1 substance for use as a placebo by a registered practitioner in
 20  2 the court of professional practice or research.
 20  3    SCHEDULE I, III, AND IV CONTROLLED SUBSTANCES.  The bill
 20  4 transfers numerous substances classified as "hallucinogenic
 20  5 substances" under schedule I and reclassifies the substances
 20  6 as "other substances" under schedule I.  By transferring the
 20  7 substances to "other substances", a person commits a class "C"
 20  8 felony under Code section 124.401(1)(c)(8) if the violation
 20  9 involves such a substance. Under current law, a person commits
 20 10 an aggravated misdemeanor under Code section 124.401(1)(d) when
 20 11 committing such violations.
 20 12    The bill adds new substances as "hallucinogenic substances"
 20 13 under schedule I.  A person commits a class "C" felony under
 20 14 Code section 124.401(1)(c)(8) if the violation involves the new
 20 15 hallucinogenic substances.
 20 16    The bill adds new substances as "stimulants" under schedule
 20 17 I.  A person commits a class "C" felony under Code section
 20 18 124.401(1)(c)(8) if the violation involves the new stimulant
 20 19 substances.
 20 20    The bill also adds new substances to the classification of
 20 21 "other substances" under schedule I.  A person commits a class
 20 22 "C" felony under Code section 124.401(1)(c)(8) for a violation
 20 23 involving the new substances.
 20 24    The bill strikes one substance classified as a
 20 25 "hallucinogenic substance" under schedule I and reclassifies
 20 26 the substance as a "stimulant" containing a synthetic cathinone

 20 28 schedule I also changes the criminal penalty for a violation
 20 29 involving the substance from a class "C" felony under Code
 20 30 section 124.401(1)(c)(8) to an aggravated misdemeanor under
 20 31 Code section 124.401(1)(d).  The bill also strikes a substance
 20 32 in Code section 124.204(6)(i)(3) from schedule I and does not
 20 33 reclassify the substance in any other substance schedule.
 20 34    The bill also removes numerous substances from schedule I
 20 35 which are currently classified as "stimulants" in Code section
 21  1 124.204(6)(i).
 21  2    The bill also strikes two narcotic substances from schedule

 16  3 substance, the person commits the following offenses: a class
 16  4 "B" felony punishable by confinement of no more than 50 years
 16  5 and a fine of not more than $1 million if the controlled
 16  6 substance containing cocaine base is more than 125 grams rather
 16  7 than the current 50 grams; a class "B" felony punishable by
 16  8 confinement of no more than 25 years and a fine of not less than
 16  9 $5,000 but not more than $100,000 if the imitation controlled
 16 10 substance is more than 35 grams but not more than 125 grams
 16 11 rather than the current 10 to 50 grams; or a class "C" felony
 16 12 punishable by a fine of not less than $1,000 but not more than
 16 13 $50,000 if the controlled substance containing cocaine base is
 16 14 35 grams or less rather than the current 10 grams or less.
 16 15    IMITATION CONTROLLED SUBSTANCES.  Under current law
 16 16 imitation controlled substances are regulated under Code
 16 17 chapter 124A.  The bill repeals Code chapter 124A and transfers
 16 18 the regulation of imitation controlled substances to Code
 16 19 chapter 124.  The definition and designation of an imitation
 16 20 controlled substance in Code chapter 124 remains identical
 16 21 to the definition and designation of an imitation controlled
 16 22 substance under current law in Code chapter 124A.
 16 23    Under the bill and in current law, an imitation controlled
 16 24 substance means a substance which is not a controlled substance
 16 25 but by color, shape, size, markings, and other aspects of
 16 26 dosage unit appearance, and packaging or other factors, appears
 16 27 to be or resembles a controlled substance. The board of
 16 28 pharmacy may designate a substance as an imitation controlled
 16 29 substance pursuant to the board's rulemaking authority and in
 16 30 accordance with Code chapter 17A.
 16 31    In addition, under current law and in the bill, if a
 16 32 substance has not been designated as an imitation controlled
 16 33 substance by the board of pharmacy and when dosage unit
 16 34 appearance alone does not establish that a substance is an
 16 35 imitation controlled substance, the following factors may
 17  1 be considered in determining whether the substance is an
 17  2 imitation controlled substance: the substance is represented
 17  3 as having the effect of a controlled substance; the substance
 17  4 is represented as a controlled substance or as a substitute for
 17  5 a controlled substance because of its nature or appearance;
 17  6 or a person receives money or other property having a value
 17  7 substantially greater than the actual value of the substance
 17  8 when sold.
 17  9    Under the bill, if a person unlawfully manufactures,
 17 10 delivers, or possesses with the intent to deliver an imitation
 17 11 controlled substance containing any detectable amount of those
 17 12 substances identified in Code section 124.204(9), or unlawfully
 17 13 acts with, enters into a common scheme or design with, or
 17 14 conspires with one or more persons to manufacture, deliver,
 17 15 or possess such imitation controlled substances, the person
 17 16 commits the following offense: a class "B" felony punishable
 17 17 by confinement of no more than 50 years and a fine of not more
 17 18 than $1 million if the imitation controlled substance is more
 17 19 than 10 kilograms; a class "B" felony punishable by confinement
 17 20 of no more than 25 years and a fine of not less than $5,000 but
 17 21 not more than $100,000 if the imitation controlled substance
 17 22 is more than five kilograms but not more than 10 kilograms; a
 17 23 class "C" felony punishable by a fine of not less than $1,000
 17 24 but not more than $50,000 if the imitation controlled substance
 17 25 is five kilograms or less; or an aggravated misdemeanor if the
 17 26 imitation controlled substance is classified in schedule IV or
 17 27 V; or a serious misdemeanor for a first possession offense,
 17 28 an aggravated misdemeanor for a second possession offense,
 17 29 or a class "D" felony for two or more previous possession
 17 30 offenses. Current law in Code section 124A.4 provides that if
 17 31 a person unlawfully manufactures, delivers, or possesses with
 17 32 intent to deliver an imitation controlled substance, the person
 17 33 commits an aggravated misdemeanor, or if the person delivers
 17 34 to a person under 18 years of age who is at least three years
 17 35 younger than the violator, the person commits a class "D"
 18  1 felony.  In addition, under current law, if a person unlawfully
 18  2 and knowingly publishes an advertisement or distributes in a
 18  3 public place a promotion for an imitation controlled substance
 18  4 the person commits a serious misdemeanor.
 18  5    The bill enhances the criminal penalties for controlled
 18  6 substances classified in Code sections 124.204(4)(ai) and
 18  7 124.204(6)(i) from an aggravated misdemeanor to a class "C"
 18  8 felony punishable pursuant to Code section 124.401(1)(c)(8).
 18  9 This change equalizes the criminal penalties with violations
 18 10 involving other schedule I controlled substances.
 18 11    The bill provides that if the same person commits two or
 18 12 more acts which are in violation of Code section 124.401(1)
 18 13 and the acts occur in the same location or time period so the
 18 14 acts are attributable to a single scheme, the acts may be
 18 15 considered a single violation and the weights of the imitation
 18 16 controlled substance may be combined for purposes of charging
 18 17 the offender.
 18 18    The amendment to Code section 124.401A provides that
 18 19 a person who is 18 years of age or older who unlawfully
 18 20 manufactures with the intent to distribute, distributes,
 18 21 or possesses with the intent to distribute an imitation
 18 22 controlled substance to another person 18 years of age or older
 18 23 within 1,000 feet of the real property comprising a public or
 18 24 nonpublic school, may be sentenced up to an additional term of
 18 25 confinement of five years in addition to any other penalty.
 18 26    The amendment to Code section 124.401B provides that
 18 27 a person who unlawfully possesses an imitation controlled
 18 28 substance within 1,000 feet of the real property comprising a
 18 29 school, public park, public pool, public recreation center, or
 18 30 marked school bus may be sentenced up to 100 hours of community
 18 31 service.
 18 32    The amendments to Code section 124.406 relate to the
 18 33 distribution or possession with the intent to distribute an
 18 34 imitation controlled substance to a person under 18 years of
 18 35 age.  A person who distributes or possesses with the intent to
 19  1 distribute an imitation controlled substance, represented to
 19  2 be a substance listed in schedule I or schedule II, to a person
 19  3 under 18 years of age commits a class "B" felony. The required
 19  4 penalty for such a violation is a minimum term of confinement
 19  5 of 10 years if the substance was distributed within 1,000
 19  6 feet of the real property comprising a public or nonpublic
 19  7 school, public park, public pool, or public recreation center.
 19  8 A person who distributes or possesses with the intent to
 19  9 distribute an imitation controlled substance, represented to be
 19 10 a substance listed in schedule III, to a person under 18 years
 19 11 of age, who is at least three years younger than the violator,
 19 12 commits a class "C" felony.  A person who distributes or
 19 13 possesses with the intent to distribute an imitation controlled
 19 14 substance, represented to be a substance listed in schedule
 19 15 IV or schedule V, to a person under 18 years of age, who is
 19 16 at least three years younger than the violator, commits an
 19 17 aggravated misdemeanor.
 19 18    The amendment to Code section 124.415 requires that a peace
 19 19 officer make a reasonable effort to identify a person under 18
 19 20 years of age discovered to be in possession of an imitation
 19 21 controlled substance, and if the person is not referred to
 19 22 juvenile court, the peace officer shall make a reasonable
 19 23 effort to notify the person's custodial parent of the
 19 24 possession unless the officer has reasonable grounds to believe
 19 25 such notification is not in the best interests of the person.
 19 26 The bill specifies that if the person is taken into custody
 19 27 the juvenile court officer shall make a reasonable effort to
 19 28 identify the school of attendance and to notify the school or
 19 29 nonpublic school of the taking into custody of the person.
 19 30    The bill creates Code section 124.417, which is similar to
 19 31 Code section 124A.5 repealed by the bill.  A person registered
 19 32 under Code section 124.302 does not violate the bill if the
 19 33 person manufactures, delivers, possesses, or possesses with the
 19 34 intent to manufacture or deliver, or acts with others to do
 19 35 such activities, if the person uses the imitation controlled
 20  1 substance for use as a placebo by a registered practitioner in
 20  2 the court of professional practice or research.
 20  3    SCHEDULE I, III, AND IV CONTROLLED SUBSTANCES.  The bill
 20  4 transfers numerous substances classified as "hallucinogenic
 20  5 substances" under schedule I and reclassifies the substances
 20  6 as "other substances" under schedule I.  By transferring the
 20  7 substances to "other substances", a person commits a class "C"
 20  8 felony under Code section 124.401(1)(c)(8) if the violation
 20  9 involves such a substance. Under current law, a person commits
 20 10 an aggravated misdemeanor under Code section 124.401(1)(d) when
 20 11 committing such violations.
 20 12    The bill adds new substances as "hallucinogenic substances"
 20 13 under schedule I.  A person commits a class "C" felony under
 20 14 Code section 124.401(1)(c)(8) if the violation involves the new
 20 15 hallucinogenic substances.
 20 16    The bill adds new substances as "stimulants" under schedule
 20 17 I.  A person commits a class "C" felony under Code section
 20 18 124.401(1)(c)(8) if the violation involves the new stimulant
 20 19 substances.
 20 20    The bill also adds new substances to the classification of
 20 21 "other substances" under schedule I.  A person commits a class
 20 22 "C" felony under Code section 124.401(1)(c)(8) for a violation
 20 23 involving the new substances.
 20 24    The bill strikes one substance classified as a
 20 25 "hallucinogenic substance" under schedule I and reclassifies
 20 26 the substance as a "stimulant" containing a synthetic cathinone
 20 27 under schedule I.  The transfer of the substance within
 20 28 schedule I also changes the criminal penalty for a violation
 20 29 involving the substance from a class "C" felony under Code
 20 30 section 124.401(1)(c)(8) to an aggravated misdemeanor under
 20 31 Code section 124.401(1)(d).  The bill also strikes a substance
 20 32 in Code section 124.204(6)(i)(3) from schedule I and does not
 20 33 reclassify the substance in any other substance schedule.
 20 34    The bill also removes numerous substances from schedule I
 20 35 which are currently classified as "stimulants" in Code section
 21  1 124.204(6)(i).
 21  2    The bill also strikes two narcotic substances from schedule
 21  3 III and adds three substances to schedule IV.  A violation
 21  4 involving a schedule IV controlled substance is punishable as
 21  5 an aggravated misdemeanor in Code section 124.401(1)(d).

 15 13    If the board of pharmacy designates a substance as
 15 14 controlled, the bill specifies that the temporary designation
 15 15 is considered a temporary amendment to the schedules of
 15 16 controlled substances in Code chapter 124, and if the general
 15 17 assembly does not amend Code chapter 124 to enact the  temporary
 15 18 amendment and make the enactment effective within two years
 15 19 from the date the temporary amendment first became effective,
 15 20 the temporary amendment is repealed by operation of law two
 15 21 years from the effective date of the temporary amendment.  A
 15 22 temporary amendment repealed by operation of law is subject to
 15 23 Code section 4.13 relating to the construction of statutes and
 15 24 the application of a general savings provision.
 15 25    Current law provides that if within 60 days after the next
 15 26 general assembly convenes the general assembly has not made
 15 27 the corresponding changes in Code chapter 124, the temporary
 15 28 designation that the substance is a controlled substance is
 15 29 nullified.
 15 30    COCAINE BASE.  The bill increases the amounts of controlled
 15 31 substances containing cocaine base (crack cocaine) that
 15 32 determine the criminal penalty for certain offenses.  Under
 15 33 the bill, if a person unlawfully manufactures, delivers, or
 15 34 possesses with the intent to deliver a controlled substance
 15 35 containing cocaine base, or unlawfully acts with, enters into
 16  1 a common scheme or design with, or conspires with one or more
 16  2 persons to manufacture, deliver, or possess such a controlled
 16  3 substance, the person commits the following offenses: a class
 16  4 "B" felony punishable by confinement of no more than 50 years
 16  5 and a fine of not more than $1 million if the controlled
 16  6 substance containing cocaine base is more than 125 grams rather
 16  7 than the current 50 grams; a class "B" felony punishable by
 16  8 confinement of no more than 25 years and a fine of not less than
 16  9 $5,000 but not more than $100,000 if the imitation controlled
 16 10 substance is more than 35 grams but not more than 125 grams
 16 11 rather than the current 10 to 50 grams; or a class "C" felony
 16 12 punishable by a fine of not less than $1,000 but not more than
 16 13 $50,000 if the controlled substance containing cocaine base is
 16 14 35 grams or less rather than the current 10 grams or less.
 16 15    IMITATION CONTROLLED SUBSTANCES.  Under current law
 16 16 imitation controlled substances are regulated under Code
 16 17 chapter 124A.  The bill repeals Code chapter 124A and transfers
 16 18 the regulation of imitation controlled substances to Code
 16 19 chapter 124.  The definition and designation of an imitation
 16 20 controlled substance in Code chapter 124 remains identical
 16 21 to the definition and designation of an imitation controlled
 16 22 substance under current law in Code chapter 124A.
 16 23    Under the bill and in current law, an imitation controlled
 16 24 substance means a substance which is not a controlled substance
 16 25 but by color, shape, size, markings, and other aspects of
 16 26 dosage unit appearance, and packaging or other factors, appears
 16 27 to be or resembles a controlled substance. The board of
 16 28 pharmacy may designate a substance as an imitation controlled
 16 29 substance pursuant to the board's rulemaking authority and in
 16 30 accordance with Code chapter 17A.
 16 31    In addition, under current law and in the bill, if a
 16 32 substance has not been designated as an imitation controlled
 16 33 substance by the board of pharmacy and when dosage unit
 16 34 appearance alone does not establish that a substance is an
 16 35 imitation controlled substance, the following factors may
 17  1 be considered in determining whether the substance is an
 17  2 imitation controlled substance: the substance is represented
 17  3 as having the effect of a controlled substance; the substance
 17  4 is represented as a controlled substance or as a substitute for
 17  5 a controlled substance because of its nature or appearance;
 17  6 or a person receives money or other property having a value
 17  7 substantially greater than the actual value of the substance
 17  8 when sold.
 17  9    Under the bill, if a person unlawfully manufactures,
 17 10 delivers, or possesses with the intent to deliver an imitation
 17 11 controlled substance containing any detectable amount of those
 17 12 substances identified in Code section 124.204(9), or unlawfully
 17 13 acts with, enters into a common scheme or design with, or
 17 14 conspires with one or more persons to manufacture, deliver,
 17 15 or possess such imitation controlled substances, the person
 17 16 commits the following offense: a class "B" felony punishable
 17 17 by confinement of no more than 50 years and a fine of not more
 17 18 than $1 million if the imitation controlled substance is more
 17 19 than 10 kilograms; a class "B" felony punishable by confinement
 17 20 of no more than 25 years and a fine of not less than $5,000 but
 17 21 not more than $100,000 if the imitation controlled substance
 17 22 is more than five kilograms but not more than 10 kilograms; a
 17 23 class "C" felony punishable by a fine of not less than $1,000
 17 24 but not more than $50,000 if the imitation controlled substance
 17 25 is five kilograms or less; or an aggravated misdemeanor if the
 17 26 imitation controlled substance is classified in schedule IV or

 17 28 an aggravated misdemeanor for a second possession offense,
 17 29 or a class "D" felony for two or more previous possession
 17 30 offenses. Current law in Code section 124A.4 provides that if
 17 31 a person unlawfully manufactures, delivers, or possesses with
 17 32 intent to deliver an imitation controlled substance, the person
 17 33 commits an aggravated misdemeanor, or if the person delivers
 17 34 to a person under 18 years of age who is at least three years
 17 35 younger than the violator, the person commits a class "D"
 18  1 felony.  In addition, under current law, if a person unlawfully
 18  2 and knowingly publishes an advertisement or distributes in a
 18  3 public place a promotion for an imitation controlled substance
 18  4 the person commits a serious misdemeanor.

 18  9 This change equalizes the criminal penalties with violations
 18 10 involving other schedule I controlled substances.
 18 11    The bill provides that if the same person commits two or
 18 12 more acts which are in violation of Code section 124.401(1)
 18 13 and the acts occur in the same location or time period so the
 18 14 acts are attributable to a single scheme, the acts may be

 18 25 confinement of five years in addition to any other penalty.
 18 26    The amendment to Code section 124.401B provides that

 18 28 substance within 1,000 feet of the real property comprising a
 18 29 school, public park, public pool, public recreation center, or
 18 30 marked school bus may be sentenced up to 100 hours of community

 18 32    The amendments to Code section 124.406 relate to the
 18 33 distribution or possession with the intent to distribute an
 18 34 imitation controlled substance to a person under 18 years of
 18 35 age.  A person who distributes or possesses with the intent to
 19  1 distribute an imitation controlled substance, represented to
 19  2 be a substance listed in schedule I or schedule II, to a person
 19  3 under 18 years of age commits a class "B" felony. The required

 19  5 of 10 years if the substance was distributed within 1,000
 19  6 feet of the real property comprising a public or nonpublic

 19 14 substance, represented to be a substance listed in schedule
 19 15 IV or schedule V, to a person under 18 years of age, who is

 19 17 aggravated misdemeanor.
 19 18    The amendment to Code section 124.415 requires that a peace
 19 19 officer make a reasonable effort to identify a person under 18
 19 20 years of age discovered to be in possession of an imitation
 19 21 controlled substance, and if the person is not referred to
 19 22 juvenile court, the peace officer shall make a reasonable
 19 23 effort to notify the person's custodial parent of the
 19 24 possession unless the officer has reasonable grounds to believe
 19 25 such notification is not in the best interests of the person.

 19 27 the juvenile court officer shall make a reasonable effort to
 19 28 identify the school of attendance and to notify the school or
 19 29 nonpublic school of the taking into custody of the person.
 19 30    The bill creates Code section 124.417, which is similar to
 19 31 Code section 124A.5 repealed by the bill.  A person registered
 19 32 under Code section 124.302 does not violate the bill if the
 19 33 person manufactures, delivers, possesses, or possesses with the
 19 34 intent to manufacture or deliver, or acts with others to do
 19 35 such activities, if the person uses the imitation controlled
 20  1 substance for use as a placebo by a registered practitioner in
 20  2 the court of professional practice or research.

 20  7 substances to "other substances", a person commits a class "C"
 20  8 felony under Code section 124.401(1)(c)(8) if the violation
 20  9 involves such a substance. Under current law, a person commits

 20 11 committing such violations.
 20 12    The bill adds new substances as "hallucinogenic substances"

 20 14 Code section 124.401(1)(c)(8) if the violation involves the new
 20 15 hallucinogenic substances.
 20 16    The bill adds new substances as "stimulants" under schedule
 20 17 I.  A person commits a class "C" felony under Code section

 20 19 substances.
 20 20    The bill also adds new substances to the classification of

 20 29 involving the substance from a class "C" felony under Code
 20 30 section 124.401(1)(c)(8) to an aggravated misdemeanor under
 20 31 Code section 124.401(1)(d).  The bill also strikes a substance
 20 32 in Code section 124.204(6)(i)(3) from schedule I and does not
 20 33 reclassify the substance in any other substance schedule.
 20 34    The bill also removes numerous substances from schedule I

 15 23 Code section 4.13 relating to the construction of statutes and
 15 24 the application of a general savings provision.
 15 25    Current law provides that if within 60 days after the next
 15 26 general assembly convenes the general assembly has not made
 15 27 the corresponding changes in Code chapter 124, the temporary
 15 28 designation that the substance is a controlled substance is
 15 29 nullified.
 15 30    COCAINE BASE.  The bill increases the amounts of controlled
 15 31 substances containing cocaine base (crack cocaine) that
 15 32 determine the criminal penalty for certain offenses.  Under
 15 33 the bill, if a person unlawfully manufactures, delivers, or
 15 34 possesses with the intent to deliver a controlled substance
 15 35 containing cocaine base, or unlawfully acts with, enters into
 16  1 a common scheme or design with, or conspires with one or more
 16  2 persons to manufacture, deliver, or possess such a controlled
 16  3 substance, the person commits the following offenses: a class
 16  4 "B" felony punishable by confinement of no more than 50 years
 16  5 and a fine of not more than $1 million if the controlled
 16  6 substance containing cocaine base is more than 125 grams rather
 16  7 than the current 50 grams; a class "B" felony punishable by
 16  8 confinement of no more than 25 years and a fine of not less than
 16  9 $5,000 but not more than $100,000 if the imitation controlled
 16 10 substance is more than 35 grams but not more than 125 grams
 16 11 rather than the current 10 to 50 grams; or a class "C" felony
 16 12 punishable by a fine of not less than $1,000 but not more than
 16 13 $50,000 if the controlled substance containing cocaine base is
 16 14 35 grams or less rather than the current 10 grams or less.
 16 15    IMITATION CONTROLLED SUBSTANCES.  Under current law
 16 16 imitation controlled substances are regulated under Code
 16 17 chapter 124A.  The bill repeals Code chapter 124A and transfers
 16 18 the regulation of imitation controlled substances to Code
 16 19 chapter 124.  The definition and designation of an imitation
 16 20 controlled substance in Code chapter 124 remains identical
 16 21 to the definition and designation of an imitation controlled
 16 22 substance under current law in Code chapter 124A.
 16 23    Under the bill and in current law, an imitation controlled
 16 24 substance means a substance which is not a controlled substance
 16 25 but by color, shape, size, markings, and other aspects of
 16 26 dosage unit appearance, and packaging or other factors, appears
 16 27 to be or resembles a controlled substance. The board of
 16 28 pharmacy may designate a substance as an imitation controlled
 16 29 substance pursuant to the board's rulemaking authority and in
 16 30 accordance with Code chapter 17A.
 16 31    In addition, under current law and in the bill, if a
 16 32 substance has not been designated as an imitation controlled
 16 33 substance by the board of pharmacy and when dosage unit
 16 34 appearance alone does not establish that a substance is an
 16 35 imitation controlled substance, the following factors may
 17  1 be considered in determining whether the substance is an
 17  2 imitation controlled substance: the substance is represented
 17  3 as having the effect of a controlled substance; the substance
 17  4 is represented as a controlled substance or as a substitute for
 17  5 a controlled substance because of its nature or appearance;
 17  6 or a person receives money or other property having a value
 17  7 substantially greater than the actual value of the substance
 17  8 when sold.
 17  9    Under the bill, if a person unlawfully manufactures,
 17 10 delivers, or possesses with the intent to deliver an imitation
 17 11 controlled substance containing any detectable amount of those
 17 12 substances identified in Code section 124.204(9), or unlawfully
 17 13 acts with, enters into a common scheme or design with, or
 17 14 conspires with one or more persons to manufacture, deliver,
 17 15 or possess such imitation controlled substances, the person
 17 16 commits the following offense: a class "B" felony punishable
 17 17 by confinement of no more than 50 years and a fine of not more
 17 18 than $1 million if the imitation controlled substance is more
 17 19 than 10 kilograms; a class "B" felony punishable by confinement
 17 20 of no more than 25 years and a fine of not less than $5,000 but
 17 21 not more than $100,000 if the imitation controlled substance
 17 22 is more than five kilograms but not more than 10 kilograms; a
 17 23 class "C" felony punishable by a fine of not less than $1,000
 17 24 but not more than $50,000 if the imitation controlled substance
 17 25 is five kilograms or less; or an aggravated misdemeanor if the
 17 26 imitation controlled substance is classified in schedule IV or
 17 27 V; or a serious misdemeanor for a first possession offense,
 17 28 an aggravated misdemeanor for a second possession offense,
 17 29 or a class "D" felony for two or more previous possession
 17 30 offenses. Current law in Code section 124A.4 provides that if
 17 31 a person unlawfully manufactures, delivers, or possesses with
 17 32 intent to deliver an imitation controlled substance, the person
 17 33 commits an aggravated misdemeanor, or if the person delivers
 17 34 to a person under 18 years of age who is at least three years
 17 35 younger than the violator, the person commits a class "D"
 18  1 felony.  In addition, under current law, if a person unlawfully
 18  2 and knowingly publishes an advertisement or distributes in a
 18  3 public place a promotion for an imitation controlled substance
 18  4 the person commits a serious misdemeanor.
 18  5    The bill enhances the criminal penalties for controlled
 18  6 substances classified in Code sections 124.204(4)(ai) and
 18  7 124.204(6)(i) from an aggravated misdemeanor to a class "C"
 18  8 felony punishable pursuant to Code section 124.401(1)(c)(8).
 18  9 This change equalizes the criminal penalties with violations
 18 10 involving other schedule I controlled substances.
 18 11    The bill provides that if the same person commits two or
 18 12 more acts which are in violation of Code section 124.401(1)
 18 13 and the acts occur in the same location or time period so the
 18 14 acts are attributable to a single scheme, the acts may be
 18 15 considered a single violation and the weights of the imitation
 18 16 controlled substance may be combined for purposes of charging
 18 17 the offender.
 18 18    The amendment to Code section 124.401A provides that
 18 19 a person who is 18 years of age or older who unlawfully
 18 20 manufactures with the intent to distribute, distributes,
 18 21 or possesses with the intent to distribute an imitation
 18 22 controlled substance to another person 18 years of age or older
 18 23 within 1,000 feet of the real property comprising a public or
 18 24 nonpublic school, may be sentenced up to an additional term of
 18 25 confinement of five years in addition to any other penalty.
 18 26    The amendment to Code section 124.401B provides that
 18 27 a person who unlawfully possesses an imitation controlled
 18 28 substance within 1,000 feet of the real property comprising a
 18 29 school, public park, public pool, public recreation center, or
 18 30 marked school bus may be sentenced up to 100 hours of community
 18 31 service.
 18 32    The amendments to Code section 124.406 relate to the
 18 33 distribution or possession with the intent to distribute an
 18 34 imitation controlled substance to a person under 18 years of
 18 35 age.  A person who distributes or possesses with the intent to
 19  1 distribute an imitation controlled substance, represented to
 19  2 be a substance listed in schedule I or schedule II, to a person
 19  3 under 18 years of age commits a class "B" felony. The required
 19  4 penalty for such a violation is a minimum term of confinement
 19  5 of 10 years if the substance was distributed within 1,000
 19  6 feet of the real property comprising a public or nonpublic
 19  7 school, public park, public pool, or public recreation center.
 19  8 A person who distributes or possesses with the intent to
 19  9 distribute an imitation controlled substance, represented to be
 19 10 a substance listed in schedule III, to a person under 18 years
 19 11 of age, who is at least three years younger than the violator,
 19 12 commits a class "C" felony.  A person who distributes or
 19 13 possesses with the intent to distribute an imitation controlled
 19 14 substance, represented to be a substance listed in schedule
 19 15 IV or schedule V, to a person under 18 years of age, who is
 19 16 at least three years younger than the violator, commits an
 19 17 aggravated misdemeanor.
 19 18    The amendment to Code section 124.415 requires that a peace
 19 19 officer make a reasonable effort to identify a person under 18
 19 20 years of age discovered to be in possession of an imitation
 19 21 controlled substance, and if the person is not referred to
 19 22 juvenile court, the peace officer shall make a reasonable
 19 23 effort to notify the person's custodial parent of the
 19 24 possession unless the officer has reasonable grounds to believe
 19 25 such notification is not in the best interests of the person.
 19 26 The bill specifies that if the person is taken into custody
 19 27 the juvenile court officer shall make a reasonable effort to
 19 28 identify the school of attendance and to notify the school or
 19 29 nonpublic school of the taking into custody of the person.
 19 30    The bill creates Code section 124.417, which is similar to
 19 31 Code section 124A.5 repealed by the bill.  A person registered
 19 32 under Code section 124.302 does not violate the bill if the
 19 33 person manufactures, delivers, possesses, or possesses with the
 19 34 intent to manufacture or deliver, or acts with others to do
 19 35 such activities, if the person uses the imitation controlled
 20  1 substance for use as a placebo by a registered practitioner in
 20  2 the court of professional practice or research.
 20  3    SCHEDULE I, III, AND IV CONTROLLED SUBSTANCES.  The bill
 20  4 transfers numerous substances classified as "hallucinogenic
 20  5 substances" under schedule I and reclassifies the substances
 20  6 as "other substances" under schedule I.  By transferring the
 20  7 substances to "other substances", a person commits a class "C"
 20  8 felony under Code section 124.401(1)(c)(8) if the violation
 20  9 involves such a substance. Under current law, a person commits
 20 10 an aggravated misdemeanor under Code section 124.401(1)(d) when
 20 11 committing such violations.
 20 12    The bill adds new substances as "hallucinogenic substances"
 20 13 under schedule I.  A person commits a class "C" felony under
 20 14 Code section 124.401(1)(c)(8) if the violation involves the new
 20 15 hallucinogenic substances.
 20 16    The bill adds new substances as "stimulants" under schedule
 20 17 I.  A person commits a class "C" felony under Code section
 20 18 124.401(1)(c)(8) if the violation involves the new stimulant
 20 19 substances.
 20 20    The bill also adds new substances to the classification of
 20 21 "other substances" under schedule I.  A person commits a class
 20 22 "C" felony under Code section 124.401(1)(c)(8) for a violation
 20 23 involving the new substances.
 20 24    The bill strikes one substance classified as a
 20 25 "hallucinogenic substance" under schedule I and reclassifies
 20 26 the substance as a "stimulant" containing a synthetic cathinone
 20 27 under schedule I.  The transfer of the substance within
 20 28 schedule I also changes the criminal penalty for a violation
 20 29 involving the substance from a class "C" felony under Code
 20 30 section 124.401(1)(c)(8) to an aggravated misdemeanor under
 20 31 Code section 124.401(1)(d).  The bill also strikes a substance
 20 32 in Code section 124.204(6)(i)(3) from schedule I and does not
 20 33 reclassify the substance in any other substance schedule.
 20 34    The bill also removes numerous substances from schedule I
 20 35 which are currently classified as "stimulants" in Code section
 21  1 124.204(6)(i).
 21  2    The bill also strikes two narcotic substances from schedule
 21  3 III and adds three substances to schedule IV.  A violation
 21  4 involving a schedule IV controlled substance is punishable as
 21  5 an aggravated misdemeanor in Code section 124.401(1)(d).

 15 15 is considered a temporary amendment to the schedules of
 15 16 controlled substances in Code chapter 124, and if the general
 15 17 assembly does not amend Code chapter 124 to enact the  temporary
 15 18 amendment and make the enactment effective within two years
 15 19 from the date the temporary amendment first became effective,
 15 20 the temporary amendment is repealed by operation of law two
 15 21 years from the effective date of the temporary amendment.  A
 15 22 temporary amendment repealed by operation of law is subject to
 15 23 Code section 4.13 relating to the construction of statutes and
 15 24 the application of a general savings provision.
 15 25    Current law provides that if within 60 days after the next

 15 27 the corresponding changes in Code chapter 124, the temporary
 15 28 designation that the substance is a controlled substance is

 15 30    COCAINE BASE.  The bill increases the amounts of controlled
 15 31 substances containing cocaine base (crack cocaine) that
 15 32 determine the criminal penalty for certain offenses.  Under
 15 33 the bill, if a person unlawfully manufactures, delivers, or

 15 35 containing cocaine base, or unlawfully acts with, enters into
 16  1 a common scheme or design with, or conspires with one or more
 16  2 persons to manufacture, deliver, or possess such a controlled
 16  3 substance, the person commits the following offenses: a class

 16 12 punishable by a fine of not less than $1,000 but not more than
 16 13 $50,000 if the controlled substance containing cocaine base is
 16 14 35 grams or less rather than the current 10 grams or less.
 16 15    IMITATION CONTROLLED SUBSTANCES.  Under current law
 16 16 imitation controlled substances are regulated under Code
 16 17 chapter 124A.  The bill repeals Code chapter 124A and transfers
 16 18 the regulation of imitation controlled substances to Code
 16 19 chapter 124.  The definition and designation of an imitation
 16 20 controlled substance in Code chapter 124 remains identical
 16 21 to the definition and designation of an imitation controlled
 16 22 substance under current law in Code chapter 124A.
 16 23    Under the bill and in current law, an imitation controlled
 16 24 substance means a substance which is not a controlled substance
 16 25 but by color, shape, size, markings, and other aspects of
 16 26 dosage unit appearance, and packaging or other factors, appears

 16 28 pharmacy may designate a substance as an imitation controlled
 16 29 substance pursuant to the board's rulemaking authority and in
 16 30 accordance with Code chapter 17A.
 16 31    In addition, under current law and in the bill, if a
 16 32 substance has not been designated as an imitation controlled
 16 33 substance by the board of pharmacy and when dosage unit
 16 34 appearance alone does not establish that a substance is an
 16 35 imitation controlled substance, the following factors may

 17  6 or a person receives money or other property having a value
 17  7 substantially greater than the actual value of the substance
 17  8 when sold.
 17  9    Under the bill, if a person unlawfully manufactures,
 17 10 delivers, or possesses with the intent to deliver an imitation

 20 11 committing such violations.
 20 12    The bill adds new substances as "hallucinogenic substances"

 20 15 hallucinogenic substances.
 20 16    The bill adds new substances as "stimulants" under schedule

 20 19 substances.
 20 20    The bill also adds new substances to the classification of

 20 28 schedule I also changes the criminal penalty for a violation
 20 29 involving the substance from a class "C" felony under Code
 20 30 section 124.401(1)(c)(8) to an aggravated misdemeanor under
 20 31 Code section 124.401(1)(d).  The bill also strikes a substance
 20 32 in Code section 124.204(6)(i)(3) from schedule I and does not
 20 33 reclassify the substance in any other substance schedule.
 20 34    The bill also removes numerous substances from schedule I

 15 17 assembly does not amend Code chapter 124 to enact the  temporary
 15 18 amendment and make the enactment effective within two years
 15 19 from the date the temporary amendment first became effective,
 15 20 the temporary amendment is repealed by operation of law two
 15 21 years from the effective date of the temporary amendment.  A
 15 22 temporary amendment repealed by operation of law is subject to
 15 23 Code section 4.13 relating to the construction of statutes and
 15 24 the application of a general savings provision.
 15 25    Current law provides that if within 60 days after the next
 15 26 general assembly convenes the general assembly has not made
 15 27 the corresponding changes in Code chapter 124, the temporary
 15 28 designation that the substance is a controlled substance is
 15 29 nullified.
 15 30    COCAINE BASE.  The bill increases the amounts of controlled
 15 31 substances containing cocaine base (crack cocaine) that
 15 32 determine the criminal penalty for certain offenses.  Under
 15 33 the bill, if a person unlawfully manufactures, delivers, or
 15 34 possesses with the intent to deliver a controlled substance
 15 35 containing cocaine base, or unlawfully acts with, enters into
 16  1 a common scheme or design with, or conspires with one or more
 16  2 persons to manufacture, deliver, or possess such a controlled
 16  3 substance, the person commits the following offenses: a class
 16  4 "B" felony punishable by confinement of no more than 50 years
 16  5 and a fine of not more than $1 million if the controlled
 16  6 substance containing cocaine base is more than 125 grams rather
 16  7 than the current 50 grams; a class "B" felony punishable by
 16  8 confinement of no more than 25 years and a fine of not less than
 16  9 $5,000 but not more than $100,000 if the imitation controlled
 16 10 substance is more than 35 grams but not more than 125 grams
 16 11 rather than the current 10 to 50 grams; or a class "C" felony
 16 12 punishable by a fine of not less than $1,000 but not more than
 16 13 $50,000 if the controlled substance containing cocaine base is
 16 14 35 grams or less rather than the current 10 grams or less.
 16 15    IMITATION CONTROLLED SUBSTANCES.  Under current law
 16 16 imitation controlled substances are regulated under Code
 16 17 chapter 124A.  The bill repeals Code chapter 124A and transfers
 16 18 the regulation of imitation controlled substances to Code
 16 19 chapter 124.  The definition and designation of an imitation
 16 20 controlled substance in Code chapter 124 remains identical
 16 21 to the definition and designation of an imitation controlled
 16 22 substance under current law in Code chapter 124A.
 16 23    Under the bill and in current law, an imitation controlled
 16 24 substance means a substance which is not a controlled substance
 16 25 but by color, shape, size, markings, and other aspects of
 16 26 dosage unit appearance, and packaging or other factors, appears
 16 27 to be or resembles a controlled substance. The board of
 16 28 pharmacy may designate a substance as an imitation controlled
 16 29 substance pursuant to the board's rulemaking authority and in
 16 30 accordance with Code chapter 17A.
 16 31    In addition, under current law and in the bill, if a
 16 32 substance has not been designated as an imitation controlled
 16 33 substance by the board of pharmacy and when dosage unit
 16 34 appearance alone does not establish that a substance is an
 16 35 imitation controlled substance, the following factors may
 17  1 be considered in determining whether the substance is an
 17  2 imitation controlled substance: the substance is represented
 17  3 as having the effect of a controlled substance; the substance
 17  4 is represented as a controlled substance or as a substitute for
 17  5 a controlled substance because of its nature or appearance;
 17  6 or a person receives money or other property having a value
 17  7 substantially greater than the actual value of the substance
 17  8 when sold.
 17  9    Under the bill, if a person unlawfully manufactures,
 17 10 delivers, or possesses with the intent to deliver an imitation
 17 11 controlled substance containing any detectable amount of those
 17 12 substances identified in Code section 124.204(9), or unlawfully
 17 13 acts with, enters into a common scheme or design with, or
 17 14 conspires with one or more persons to manufacture, deliver,
 17 15 or possess such imitation controlled substances, the person
 17 16 commits the following offense: a class "B" felony punishable
 17 17 by confinement of no more than 50 years and a fine of not more
 17 18 than $1 million if the imitation controlled substance is more
 17 19 than 10 kilograms; a class "B" felony punishable by confinement
 17 20 of no more than 25 years and a fine of not less than $5,000 but
 17 21 not more than $100,000 if the imitation controlled substance
 17 22 is more than five kilograms but not more than 10 kilograms; a
 17 23 class "C" felony punishable by a fine of not less than $1,000
 17 24 but not more than $50,000 if the imitation controlled substance
 17 25 is five kilograms or less; or an aggravated misdemeanor if the
 17 26 imitation controlled substance is classified in schedule IV or
 17 27 V; or a serious misdemeanor for a first possession offense,
 17 28 an aggravated misdemeanor for a second possession offense,
 17 29 or a class "D" felony for two or more previous possession
 17 30 offenses. Current law in Code section 124A.4 provides that if
 17 31 a person unlawfully manufactures, delivers, or possesses with
 17 32 intent to deliver an imitation controlled substance, the person
 17 33 commits an aggravated misdemeanor, or if the person delivers
 17 34 to a person under 18 years of age who is at least three years
 17 35 younger than the violator, the person commits a class "D"
 18  1 felony.  In addition, under current law, if a person unlawfully
 18  2 and knowingly publishes an advertisement or distributes in a
 18  3 public place a promotion for an imitation controlled substance
 18  4 the person commits a serious misdemeanor.
 18  5    The bill enhances the criminal penalties for controlled
 18  6 substances classified in Code sections 124.204(4)(ai) and
 18  7 124.204(6)(i) from an aggravated misdemeanor to a class "C"
 18  8 felony punishable pursuant to Code section 124.401(1)(c)(8).
 18  9 This change equalizes the criminal penalties with violations
 18 10 involving other schedule I controlled substances.
 18 11    The bill provides that if the same person commits two or
 18 12 more acts which are in violation of Code section 124.401(1)
 18 13 and the acts occur in the same location or time period so the
 18 14 acts are attributable to a single scheme, the acts may be
 18 15 considered a single violation and the weights of the imitation
 18 16 controlled substance may be combined for purposes of charging
 18 17 the offender.
 18 18    The amendment to Code section 124.401A provides that
 18 19 a person who is 18 years of age or older who unlawfully
 18 20 manufactures with the intent to distribute, distributes,
 18 21 or possesses with the intent to distribute an imitation
 18 22 controlled substance to another person 18 years of age or older
 18 23 within 1,000 feet of the real property comprising a public or
 18 24 nonpublic school, may be sentenced up to an additional term of
 18 25 confinement of five years in addition to any other penalty.
 18 26    The amendment to Code section 124.401B provides that
 18 27 a person who unlawfully possesses an imitation controlled
 18 28 substance within 1,000 feet of the real property comprising a
 18 29 school, public park, public pool, public recreation center, or
 18 30 marked school bus may be sentenced up to 100 hours of community
 18 31 service.
 18 32    The amendments to Code section 124.406 relate to the
 18 33 distribution or possession with the intent to distribute an
 18 34 imitation controlled substance to a person under 18 years of
 18 35 age.  A person who distributes or possesses with the intent to
 19  1 distribute an imitation controlled substance, represented to
 19  2 be a substance listed in schedule I or schedule II, to a person
 19  3 under 18 years of age commits a class "B" felony. The required
 19  4 penalty for such a violation is a minimum term of confinement
 19  5 of 10 years if the substance was distributed within 1,000
 19  6 feet of the real property comprising a public or nonpublic
 19  7 school, public park, public pool, or public recreation center.
 19  8 A person who distributes or possesses with the intent to
 19  9 distribute an imitation controlled substance, represented to be
 19 10 a substance listed in schedule III, to a person under 18 years
 19 11 of age, who is at least three years younger than the violator,
 19 12 commits a class "C" felony.  A person who distributes or
 19 13 possesses with the intent to distribute an imitation controlled
 19 14 substance, represented to be a substance listed in schedule
 19 15 IV or schedule V, to a person under 18 years of age, who is
 19 16 at least three years younger than the violator, commits an
 19 17 aggravated misdemeanor.
 19 18    The amendment to Code section 124.415 requires that a peace
 19 19 officer make a reasonable effort to identify a person under 18
 19 20 years of age discovered to be in possession of an imitation
 19 21 controlled substance, and if the person is not referred to
 19 22 juvenile court, the peace officer shall make a reasonable
 19 23 effort to notify the person's custodial parent of the
 19 24 possession unless the officer has reasonable grounds to believe
 19 25 such notification is not in the best interests of the person.
 19 26 The bill specifies that if the person is taken into custody
 19 27 the juvenile court officer shall make a reasonable effort to
 19 28 identify the school of attendance and to notify the school or
 19 29 nonpublic school of the taking into custody of the person.
 19 30    The bill creates Code section 124.417, which is similar to
 19 31 Code section 124A.5 repealed by the bill.  A person registered
 19 32 under Code section 124.302 does not violate the bill if the
 19 33 person manufactures, delivers, possesses, or possesses with the
 19 34 intent to manufacture or deliver, or acts with others to do
 19 35 such activities, if the person uses the imitation controlled
 20  1 substance for use as a placebo by a registered practitioner in
 20  2 the court of professional practice or research.
 20  3    SCHEDULE I, III, AND IV CONTROLLED SUBSTANCES.  The bill
 20  4 transfers numerous substances classified as "hallucinogenic
 20  5 substances" under schedule I and reclassifies the substances
 20  6 as "other substances" under schedule I.  By transferring the
 20  7 substances to "other substances", a person commits a class "C"
 20  8 felony under Code section 124.401(1)(c)(8) if the violation
 20  9 involves such a substance. Under current law, a person commits
 20 10 an aggravated misdemeanor under Code section 124.401(1)(d) when
 20 11 committing such violations.
 20 12    The bill adds new substances as "hallucinogenic substances"
 20 13 under schedule I.  A person commits a class "C" felony under
 20 14 Code section 124.401(1)(c)(8) if the violation involves the new
 20 15 hallucinogenic substances.
 20 16    The bill adds new substances as "stimulants" under schedule
 20 17 I.  A person commits a class "C" felony under Code section
 20 18 124.401(1)(c)(8) if the violation involves the new stimulant
 20 19 substances.
 20 20    The bill also adds new substances to the classification of
 20 21 "other substances" under schedule I.  A person commits a class
 20 22 "C" felony under Code section 124.401(1)(c)(8) for a violation
 20 23 involving the new substances.
 20 24    The bill strikes one substance classified as a
 20 25 "hallucinogenic substance" under schedule I and reclassifies
 20 26 the substance as a "stimulant" containing a synthetic cathinone
 20 27 under schedule I.  The transfer of the substance within
 20 28 schedule I also changes the criminal penalty for a violation
 20 29 involving the substance from a class "C" felony under Code
 20 30 section 124.401(1)(c)(8) to an aggravated misdemeanor under
 20 31 Code section 124.401(1)(d).  The bill also strikes a substance
 20 32 in Code section 124.204(6)(i)(3) from schedule I and does not
 20 33 reclassify the substance in any other substance schedule.
 20 34    The bill also removes numerous substances from schedule I
 20 35 which are currently classified as "stimulants" in Code section
 21  1 124.204(6)(i).
 21  2    The bill also strikes two narcotic substances from schedule
 21  3 III and adds three substances to schedule IV.  A violation
 21  4 involving a schedule IV controlled substance is punishable as
 21  5 an aggravated misdemeanor in Code section 124.401(1)(d).

 15 18 amendment and make the enactment effective within two years
 15 19 from the date the temporary amendment first became effective,
 15 20 the temporary amendment is repealed by operation of law two
 15 21 years from the effective date of the temporary amendment.  A
 15 22 temporary amendment repealed by operation of law is subject to
 15 23 Code section 4.13 relating to the construction of statutes and
 15 24 the application of a general savings provision.
 15 25    Current law provides that if within 60 days after the next
 15 26 general assembly convenes the general assembly has not made
 15 27 the corresponding changes in Code chapter 124, the temporary
 15 28 designation that the substance is a controlled substance is
 15 29 nullified.
 15 30    COCAINE BASE.  The bill increases the amounts of controlled
 15 31 substances containing cocaine base (crack cocaine) that
 15 32 determine the criminal penalty for certain offenses.  Under
 15 33 the bill, if a person unlawfully manufactures, delivers, or
 15 34 possesses with the intent to deliver a controlled substance
 15 35 containing cocaine base, or unlawfully acts with, enters into
 16  1 a common scheme or design with, or conspires with one or more
 16  2 persons to manufacture, deliver, or possess such a controlled
 16  3 substance, the person commits the following offenses: a class
 16  4 "B" felony punishable by confinement of no more than 50 years
 16  5 and a fine of not more than $1 million if the controlled
 16  6 substance containing cocaine base is more than 125 grams rather
 16  7 than the current 50 grams; a class "B" felony punishable by
 16  8 confinement of no more than 25 years and a fine of not less than
 16  9 $5,000 but not more than $100,000 if the imitation controlled
 16 10 substance is more than 35 grams but not more than 125 grams
 16 11 rather than the current 10 to 50 grams; or a class "C" felony
 16 12 punishable by a fine of not less than $1,000 but not more than
 16 13 $50,000 if the controlled substance containing cocaine base is
 16 14 35 grams or less rather than the current 10 grams or less.
 16 15    IMITATION CONTROLLED SUBSTANCES.  Under current law
 16 16 imitation controlled substances are regulated under Code
 16 17 chapter 124A.  The bill repeals Code chapter 124A and transfers
 16 18 the regulation of imitation controlled substances to Code
 16 19 chapter 124.  The definition and designation of an imitation
 16 20 controlled substance in Code chapter 124 remains identical
 16 21 to the definition and designation of an imitation controlled
 16 22 substance under current law in Code chapter 124A.
 16 23    Under the bill and in current law, an imitation controlled
 16 24 substance means a substance which is not a controlled substance
 16 25 but by color, shape, size, markings, and other aspects of
 16 26 dosage unit appearance, and packaging or other factors, appears
 16 27 to be or resembles a controlled substance. The board of
 16 28 pharmacy may designate a substance as an imitation controlled
 16 29 substance pursuant to the board's rulemaking authority and in
 16 30 accordance with Code chapter 17A.
 16 31    In addition, under current law and in the bill, if a
 16 32 substance has not been designated as an imitation controlled
 16 33 substance by the board of pharmacy and when dosage unit
 16 34 appearance alone does not establish that a substance is an
 16 35 imitation controlled substance, the following factors may
 17  1 be considered in determining whether the substance is an
 17  2 imitation controlled substance: the substance is represented
 17  3 as having the effect of a controlled substance; the substance
 17  4 is represented as a controlled substance or as a substitute for
 17  5 a controlled substance because of its nature or appearance;
 17  6 or a person receives money or other property having a value
 17  7 substantially greater than the actual value of the substance
 17  8 when sold.
 17  9    Under the bill, if a person unlawfully manufactures,
 17 10 delivers, or possesses with the intent to deliver an imitation
 17 11 controlled substance containing any detectable amount of those
 17 12 substances identified in Code section 124.204(9), or unlawfully
 17 13 acts with, enters into a common scheme or design with, or
 17 14 conspires with one or more persons to manufacture, deliver,
 17 15 or possess such imitation controlled substances, the person
 17 16 commits the following offense: a class "B" felony punishable
 17 17 by confinement of no more than 50 years and a fine of not more
 17 18 than $1 million if the imitation controlled substance is more
 17 19 than 10 kilograms; a class "B" felony punishable by confinement
 17 20 of no more than 25 years and a fine of not less than $5,000 but
 17 21 not more than $100,000 if the imitation controlled substance
 17 22 is more than five kilograms but not more than 10 kilograms; a
 17 23 class "C" felony punishable by a fine of not less than $1,000
 17 24 but not more than $50,000 if the imitation controlled substance
 17 25 is five kilograms or less; or an aggravated misdemeanor if the
 17 26 imitation controlled substance is classified in schedule IV or
 17 27 V; or a serious misdemeanor for a first possession offense,
 17 28 an aggravated misdemeanor for a second possession offense,
 17 29 or a class "D" felony for two or more previous possession
 17 30 offenses. Current law in Code section 124A.4 provides that if
 17 31 a person unlawfully manufactures, delivers, or possesses with
 17 32 intent to deliver an imitation controlled substance, the person
 17 33 commits an aggravated misdemeanor, or if the person delivers
 17 34 to a person under 18 years of age who is at least three years
 17 35 younger than the violator, the person commits a class "D"
 18  1 felony.  In addition, under current law, if a person unlawfully
 18  2 and knowingly publishes an advertisement or distributes in a
 18  3 public place a promotion for an imitation controlled substance
 18  4 the person commits a serious misdemeanor.
 18  5    The bill enhances the criminal penalties for controlled
 18  6 substances classified in Code sections 124.204(4)(ai) and
 18  7 124.204(6)(i) from an aggravated misdemeanor to a class "C"
 18  8 felony punishable pursuant to Code section 124.401(1)(c)(8).
 18  9 This change equalizes the criminal penalties with violations
 18 10 involving other schedule I controlled substances.
 18 11    The bill provides that if the same person commits two or
 18 12 more acts which are in violation of Code section 124.401(1)
 18 13 and the acts occur in the same location or time period so the
 18 14 acts are attributable to a single scheme, the acts may be
 18 15 considered a single violation and the weights of the imitation
 18 16 controlled substance may be combined for purposes of charging
 18 17 the offender.
 18 18    The amendment to Code section 124.401A provides that
 18 19 a person who is 18 years of age or older who unlawfully
 18 20 manufactures with the intent to distribute, distributes,
 18 21 or possesses with the intent to distribute an imitation
 18 22 controlled substance to another person 18 years of age or older
 18 23 within 1,000 feet of the real property comprising a public or
 18 24 nonpublic school, may be sentenced up to an additional term of
 18 25 confinement of five years in addition to any other penalty.
 18 26    The amendment to Code section 124.401B provides that
 18 27 a person who unlawfully possesses an imitation controlled
 18 28 substance within 1,000 feet of the real property comprising a
 18 29 school, public park, public pool, public recreation center, or
 18 30 marked school bus may be sentenced up to 100 hours of community
 18 31 service.
 18 32    The amendments to Code section 124.406 relate to the
 18 33 distribution or possession with the intent to distribute an
 18 34 imitation controlled substance to a person under 18 years of
 18 35 age.  A person who distributes or possesses with the intent to
 19  1 distribute an imitation controlled substance, represented to
 19  2 be a substance listed in schedule I or schedule II, to a person
 19  3 under 18 years of age commits a class "B" felony. The required
 19  4 penalty for such a violation is a minimum term of confinement
 19  5 of 10 years if the substance was distributed within 1,000
 19  6 feet of the real property comprising a public or nonpublic
 19  7 school, public park, public pool, or public recreation center.
 19  8 A person who distributes or possesses with the intent to
 19  9 distribute an imitation controlled substance, represented to be
 19 10 a substance listed in schedule III, to a person under 18 years
 19 11 of age, who is at least three years younger than the violator,
 19 12 commits a class "C" felony.  A person who distributes or
 19 13 possesses with the intent to distribute an imitation controlled
 19 14 substance, represented to be a substance listed in schedule
 19 15 IV or schedule V, to a person under 18 years of age, who is
 19 16 at least three years younger than the violator, commits an
 19 17 aggravated misdemeanor.
 19 18    The amendment to Code section 124.415 requires that a peace
 19 19 officer make a reasonable effort to identify a person under 18
 19 20 years of age discovered to be in possession of an imitation
 19 21 controlled substance, and if the person is not referred to
 19 22 juvenile court, the peace officer shall make a reasonable
 19 23 effort to notify the person's custodial parent of the
 19 24 possession unless the officer has reasonable grounds to believe
 19 25 such notification is not in the best interests of the person.
 19 26 The bill specifies that if the person is taken into custody
 19 27 the juvenile court officer shall make a reasonable effort to
 19 28 identify the school of attendance and to notify the school or
 19 29 nonpublic school of the taking into custody of the person.
 19 30    The bill creates Code section 124.417, which is similar to
 19 31 Code section 124A.5 repealed by the bill.  A person registered
 19 32 under Code section 124.302 does not violate the bill if the
 19 33 person manufactures, delivers, possesses, or possesses with the
 19 34 intent to manufacture or deliver, or acts with others to do
 19 35 such activities, if the person uses the imitation controlled
 20  1 substance for use as a placebo by a registered practitioner in
 20  2 the court of professional practice or research.
 20  3    SCHEDULE I, III, AND IV CONTROLLED SUBSTANCES.  The bill
 20  4 transfers numerous substances classified as "hallucinogenic
 20  5 substances" under schedule I and reclassifies the substances
 20  6 as "other substances" under schedule I.  By transferring the
 20  7 substances to "other substances", a person commits a class "C"
 20  8 felony under Code section 124.401(1)(c)(8) if the violation
 20  9 involves such a substance. Under current law, a person commits
 20 10 an aggravated misdemeanor under Code section 124.401(1)(d) when
 20 11 committing such violations.
 20 12    The bill adds new substances as "hallucinogenic substances"
 20 13 under schedule I.  A person commits a class "C" felony under
 20 14 Code section 124.401(1)(c)(8) if the violation involves the new
 20 15 hallucinogenic substances.
 20 16    The bill adds new substances as "stimulants" under schedule
 20 17 I.  A person commits a class "C" felony under Code section
 20 18 124.401(1)(c)(8) if the violation involves the new stimulant
 20 19 substances.
 20 20    The bill also adds new substances to the classification of
 20 21 "other substances" under schedule I.  A person commits a class
 20 22 "C" felony under Code section 124.401(1)(c)(8) for a violation
 20 23 involving the new substances.
 20 24    The bill strikes one substance classified as a
 20 25 "hallucinogenic substance" under schedule I and reclassifies
 20 26 the substance as a "stimulant" containing a synthetic cathinone
 20 27 under schedule I.  The transfer of the substance within
 20 28 schedule I also changes the criminal penalty for a violation
 20 29 involving the substance from a class "C" felony under Code
 20 30 section 124.401(1)(c)(8) to an aggravated misdemeanor under
 20 31 Code section 124.401(1)(d).  The bill also strikes a substance
 20 32 in Code section 124.204(6)(i)(3) from schedule I and does not
 20 33 reclassify the substance in any other substance schedule.
 20 34    The bill also removes numerous substances from schedule I
 20 35 which are currently classified as "stimulants" in Code section
 21  1 124.204(6)(i).
 21  2    The bill also strikes two narcotic substances from schedule
 21  3 III and adds three substances to schedule IV.  A violation

 20 28 schedule I also changes the criminal penalty for a violation
 20 29 involving the substance from a class "C" felony under Code
 20 30 section 124.401(1)(c)(8) to an aggravated misdemeanor under
 20 31 Code section 124.401(1)(d).  The bill also strikes a substance
 20 32 in Code section 124.204(6)(i)(3) from schedule I and does not
 20 33 reclassify the substance in any other substance schedule.
 20 34    The bill also removes numerous substances from schedule I
 20 35 which are currently classified as "stimulants" in Code section
 21  1 124.204(6)(i).
 21  2    The bill also strikes two narcotic substances from schedule
 21  3 III and adds three substances to schedule IV.  A violation
 21  4 involving a schedule IV controlled substance is punishable as
 21  5 an aggravated misdemeanor in Code section 124.401(1)(d).

 15 20 the temporary amendment is repealed by operation of law two
 15 21 years from the effective date of the temporary amendment.  A
 15 22 temporary amendment repealed by operation of law is subject to
 15 23 Code section 4.13 relating to the construction of statutes and
 15 24 the application of a general savings provision.
 15 25    Current law provides that if within 60 days after the next
 15 26 general assembly convenes the general assembly has not made
 15 27 the corresponding changes in Code chapter 124, the temporary
 15 28 designation that the substance is a controlled substance is
 15 29 nullified.
 15 30    COCAINE BASE.  The bill increases the amounts of controlled
 15 31 substances containing cocaine base (crack cocaine) that
 15 32 determine the criminal penalty for certain offenses.  Under
 15 33 the bill, if a person unlawfully manufactures, delivers, or
 15 34 possesses with the intent to deliver a controlled substance
 15 35 containing cocaine base, or unlawfully acts with, enters into
 16  1 a common scheme or design with, or conspires with one or more
 16  2 persons to manufacture, deliver, or possess such a controlled
 16  3 substance, the person commits the following offenses: a class
 16  4 "B" felony punishable by confinement of no more than 50 years
 16  5 and a fine of not more than $1 million if the controlled
 16  6 substance containing cocaine base is more than 125 grams rather
 16  7 than the current 50 grams; a class "B" felony punishable by
 16  8 confinement of no more than 25 years and a fine of not less than
 16  9 $5,000 but not more than $100,000 if the imitation controlled
 16 10 substance is more than 35 grams but not more than 125 grams
 16 11 rather than the current 10 to 50 grams; or a class "C" felony
 16 12 punishable by a fine of not less than $1,000 but not more than
 16 13 $50,000 if the controlled substance containing cocaine base is
 16 14 35 grams or less rather than the current 10 grams or less.
 16 15    IMITATION CONTROLLED SUBSTANCES.  Under current law
 16 16 imitation controlled substances are regulated under Code
 16 17 chapter 124A.  The bill repeals Code chapter 124A and transfers
 16 18 the regulation of imitation controlled substances to Code
 16 19 chapter 124.  The definition and designation of an imitation
 16 20 controlled substance in Code chapter 124 remains identical
 16 21 to the definition and designation of an imitation controlled
 16 22 substance under current law in Code chapter 124A.
 16 23    Under the bill and in current law, an imitation controlled
 16 24 substance means a substance which is not a controlled substance
 16 25 but by color, shape, size, markings, and other aspects of
 16 26 dosage unit appearance, and packaging or other factors, appears
 16 27 to be or resembles a controlled substance. The board of
 16 28 pharmacy may designate a substance as an imitation controlled
 16 29 substance pursuant to the board's rulemaking authority and in
 16 30 accordance with Code chapter 17A.
 16 31    In addition, under current law and in the bill, if a
 16 32 substance has not been designated as an imitation controlled
 16 33 substance by the board of pharmacy and when dosage unit
 16 34 appearance alone does not establish that a substance is an
 16 35 imitation controlled substance, the following factors may
 17  1 be considered in determining whether the substance is an
 17  2 imitation controlled substance: the substance is represented
 17  3 as having the effect of a controlled substance; the substance
 17  4 is represented as a controlled substance or as a substitute for
 17  5 a controlled substance because of its nature or appearance;
 17  6 or a person receives money or other property having a value
 17  7 substantially greater than the actual value of the substance
 17  8 when sold.
 17  9    Under the bill, if a person unlawfully manufactures,
 17 10 delivers, or possesses with the intent to deliver an imitation
 17 11 controlled substance containing any detectable amount of those
 17 12 substances identified in Code section 124.204(9), or unlawfully
 17 13 acts with, enters into a common scheme or design with, or
 17 14 conspires with one or more persons to manufacture, deliver,
 17 15 or possess such imitation controlled substances, the person
 17 16 commits the following offense: a class "B" felony punishable
 17 17 by confinement of no more than 50 years and a fine of not more
 17 18 than $1 million if the imitation controlled substance is more
 17 19 than 10 kilograms; a class "B" felony punishable by confinement
 17 20 of no more than 25 years and a fine of not less than $5,000 but
 17 21 not more than $100,000 if the imitation controlled substance
 17 22 is more than five kilograms but not more than 10 kilograms; a
 17 23 class "C" felony punishable by a fine of not less than $1,000
 17 24 but not more than $50,000 if the imitation controlled substance
 17 25 is five kilograms or less; or an aggravated misdemeanor if the
 17 26 imitation controlled substance is classified in schedule IV or
 17 27 V; or a serious misdemeanor for a first possession offense,
 17 28 an aggravated misdemeanor for a second possession offense,
 17 29 or a class "D" felony for two or more previous possession
 17 30 offenses. Current law in Code section 124A.4 provides that if
 17 31 a person unlawfully manufactures, delivers, or possesses with
 17 32 intent to deliver an imitation controlled substance, the person
 17 33 commits an aggravated misdemeanor, or if the person delivers
 17 34 to a person under 18 years of age who is at least three years
 17 35 younger than the violator, the person commits a class "D"
 18  1 felony.  In addition, under current law, if a person unlawfully
 18  2 and knowingly publishes an advertisement or distributes in a
 18  3 public place a promotion for an imitation controlled substance
 18  4 the person commits a serious misdemeanor.
 18  5    The bill enhances the criminal penalties for controlled
 18  6 substances classified in Code sections 124.204(4)(ai) and
 18  7 124.204(6)(i) from an aggravated misdemeanor to a class "C"
 18  8 felony punishable pursuant to Code section 124.401(1)(c)(8).
 18  9 This change equalizes the criminal penalties with violations
 18 10 involving other schedule I controlled substances.
 18 11    The bill provides that if the same person commits two or
 18 12 more acts which are in violation of Code section 124.401(1)
 18 13 and the acts occur in the same location or time period so the
 18 14 acts are attributable to a single scheme, the acts may be
 18 15 considered a single violation and the weights of the imitation
 18 16 controlled substance may be combined for purposes of charging
 18 17 the offender.
 18 18    The amendment to Code section 124.401A provides that
 18 19 a person who is 18 years of age or older who unlawfully
 18 20 manufactures with the intent to distribute, distributes,
 18 21 or possesses with the intent to distribute an imitation
 18 22 controlled substance to another person 18 years of age or older
 18 23 within 1,000 feet of the real property comprising a public or
 18 24 nonpublic school, may be sentenced up to an additional term of
 18 25 confinement of five years in addition to any other penalty.
 18 26    The amendment to Code section 124.401B provides that
 18 27 a person who unlawfully possesses an imitation controlled
 18 28 substance within 1,000 feet of the real property comprising a
 18 29 school, public park, public pool, public recreation center, or
 18 30 marked school bus may be sentenced up to 100 hours of community
 18 31 service.
 18 32    The amendments to Code section 124.406 relate to the
 18 33 distribution or possession with the intent to distribute an
 18 34 imitation controlled substance to a person under 18 years of
 18 35 age.  A person who distributes or possesses with the intent to
 19  1 distribute an imitation controlled substance, represented to
 19  2 be a substance listed in schedule I or schedule II, to a person
 19  3 under 18 years of age commits a class "B" felony. The required
 19  4 penalty for such a violation is a minimum term of confinement
 19  5 of 10 years if the substance was distributed within 1,000
 19  6 feet of the real property comprising a public or nonpublic
 19  7 school, public park, public pool, or public recreation center.
 19  8 A person who distributes or possesses with the intent to
 19  9 distribute an imitation controlled substance, represented to be
 19 10 a substance listed in schedule III, to a person under 18 years
 19 11 of age, who is at least three years younger than the violator,
 19 12 commits a class "C" felony.  A person who distributes or
 19 13 possesses with the intent to distribute an imitation controlled
 19 14 substance, represented to be a substance listed in schedule
 19 15 IV or schedule V, to a person under 18 years of age, who is
 19 16 at least three years younger than the violator, commits an
 19 17 aggravated misdemeanor.
 19 18    The amendment to Code section 124.415 requires that a peace
 19 19 officer make a reasonable effort to identify a person under 18
 19 20 years of age discovered to be in possession of an imitation
 19 21 controlled substance, and if the person is not referred to
 19 22 juvenile court, the peace officer shall make a reasonable
 19 23 effort to notify the person's custodial parent of the
 19 24 possession unless the officer has reasonable grounds to believe
 19 25 such notification is not in the best interests of the person.
 19 26 The bill specifies that if the person is taken into custody
 19 27 the juvenile court officer shall make a reasonable effort to
 19 28 identify the school of attendance and to notify the school or
 19 29 nonpublic school of the taking into custody of the person.
 19 30    The bill creates Code section 124.417, which is similar to
 19 31 Code section 124A.5 repealed by the bill.  A person registered
 19 32 under Code section 124.302 does not violate the bill if the
 19 33 person manufactures, delivers, possesses, or possesses with the
 19 34 intent to manufacture or deliver, or acts with others to do
 19 35 such activities, if the person uses the imitation controlled
 20  1 substance for use as a placebo by a registered practitioner in
 20  2 the court of professional practice or research.
 20  3    SCHEDULE I, III, AND IV CONTROLLED SUBSTANCES.  The bill
 20  4 transfers numerous substances classified as "hallucinogenic
 20  5 substances" under schedule I and reclassifies the substances
 20  6 as "other substances" under schedule I.  By transferring the
 20  7 substances to "other substances", a person commits a class "C"
 20  8 felony under Code section 124.401(1)(c)(8) if the violation
 20  9 involves such a substance. Under current law, a person commits
 20 10 an aggravated misdemeanor under Code section 124.401(1)(d) when
 20 11 committing such violations.
 20 12    The bill adds new substances as "hallucinogenic substances"
 20 13 under schedule I.  A person commits a class "C" felony under
 20 14 Code section 124.401(1)(c)(8) if the violation involves the new
 20 15 hallucinogenic substances.
 20 16    The bill adds new substances as "stimulants" under schedule
 20 17 I.  A person commits a class "C" felony under Code section
 20 18 124.401(1)(c)(8) if the violation involves the new stimulant
 20 19 substances.
 20 20    The bill also adds new substances to the classification of
 20 21 "other substances" under schedule I.  A person commits a class
 20 22 "C" felony under Code section 124.401(1)(c)(8) for a violation
 20 23 involving the new substances.
 20 24    The bill strikes one substance classified as a
 20 25 "hallucinogenic substance" under schedule I and reclassifies
 20 26 the substance as a "stimulant" containing a synthetic cathinone
 20 27 under schedule I.  The transfer of the substance within
 20 28 schedule I also changes the criminal penalty for a violation
 20 29 involving the substance from a class "C" felony under Code
 20 30 section 124.401(1)(c)(8) to an aggravated misdemeanor under
 20 31 Code section 124.401(1)(d).  The bill also strikes a substance
 20 32 in Code section 124.204(6)(i)(3) from schedule I and does not
 20 33 reclassify the substance in any other substance schedule.
 20 34    The bill also removes numerous substances from schedule I
 20 35 which are currently classified as "stimulants" in Code section
 21  1 124.204(6)(i).
 21  2    The bill also strikes two narcotic substances from schedule
 21  3 III and adds three substances to schedule IV.  A violation
 21  4 involving a schedule IV controlled substance is punishable as

 20 27 under schedule I.  The transfer of the substance within
 20 28 schedule I also changes the criminal penalty for a violation
 20 29 involving the substance from a class "C" felony under Code
 20 30 section 124.401(1)(c)(8) to an aggravated misdemeanor under
 20 31 Code section 124.401(1)(d).  The bill also strikes a substance
 20 32 in Code section 124.204(6)(i)(3) from schedule I and does not
 20 33 reclassify the substance in any other substance schedule.
 20 34    The bill also removes numerous substances from schedule I
 20 35 which are currently classified as "stimulants" in Code section
 21  1 124.204(6)(i).
 21  2    The bill also strikes two narcotic substances from schedule
 21  3 III and adds three substances to schedule IV.  A violation
 21  4 involving a schedule IV controlled substance is punishable as
 21  5 an aggravated misdemeanor in Code section 124.401(1)(d).

 15 22 temporary amendment repealed by operation of law is subject to
 15 23 Code section 4.13 relating to the construction of statutes and
 15 24 the application of a general savings provision.
 15 25    Current law provides that if within 60 days after the next
 15 26 general assembly convenes the general assembly has not made
 15 27 the corresponding changes in Code chapter 124, the temporary
 15 28 designation that the substance is a controlled substance is
 15 29 nullified.
 15 30    COCAINE BASE.  The bill increases the amounts of controlled
 15 31 substances containing cocaine base (crack cocaine) that
 15 32 determine the criminal penalty for certain offenses.  Under
 15 33 the bill, if a person unlawfully manufactures, delivers, or
 15 34 possesses with the intent to deliver a controlled substance
 15 35 containing cocaine base, or unlawfully acts with, enters into
 16  1 a common scheme or design with, or conspires with one or more
 16  2 persons to manufacture, deliver, or possess such a controlled
 16  3 substance, the person commits the following offenses: a class
 16  4 "B" felony punishable by confinement of no more than 50 years
 16  5 and a fine of not more than $1 million if the controlled
 16  6 substance containing cocaine base is more than 125 grams rather
 16  7 than the current 50 grams; a class "B" felony punishable by
 16  8 confinement of no more than 25 years and a fine of not less than
 16  9 $5,000 but not more than $100,000 if the imitation controlled
 16 10 substance is more than 35 grams but not more than 125 grams
 16 11 rather than the current 10 to 50 grams; or a class "C" felony
 16 12 punishable by a fine of not less than $1,000 but not more than
 16 13 $50,000 if the controlled substance containing cocaine base is
 16 14 35 grams or less rather than the current 10 grams or less.
 16 15    IMITATION CONTROLLED SUBSTANCES.  Under current law
 16 16 imitation controlled substances are regulated under Code
 16 17 chapter 124A.  The bill repeals Code chapter 124A and transfers
 16 18 the regulation of imitation controlled substances to Code
 16 19 chapter 124.  The definition and designation of an imitation
 16 20 controlled substance in Code chapter 124 remains identical
 16 21 to the definition and designation of an imitation controlled
 16 22 substance under current law in Code chapter 124A.
 16 23    Under the bill and in current law, an imitation controlled
 16 24 substance means a substance which is not a controlled substance
 16 25 but by color, shape, size, markings, and other aspects of
 16 26 dosage unit appearance, and packaging or other factors, appears
 16 27 to be or resembles a controlled substance. The board of
 16 28 pharmacy may designate a substance as an imitation controlled
 16 29 substance pursuant to the board's rulemaking authority and in
 16 30 accordance with Code chapter 17A.
 16 31    In addition, under current law and in the bill, if a
 16 32 substance has not been designated as an imitation controlled
 16 33 substance by the board of pharmacy and when dosage unit
 16 34 appearance alone does not establish that a substance is an
 16 35 imitation controlled substance, the following factors may
 17  1 be considered in determining whether the substance is an
 17  2 imitation controlled substance: the substance is represented
 17  3 as having the effect of a controlled substance; the substance
 17  4 is represented as a controlled substance or as a substitute for
 17  5 a controlled substance because of its nature or appearance;
 17  6 or a person receives money or other property having a value
 17  7 substantially greater than the actual value of the substance
 17  8 when sold.
 17  9    Under the bill, if a person unlawfully manufactures,
 17 10 delivers, or possesses with the intent to deliver an imitation
 17 11 controlled substance containing any detectable amount of those
 17 12 substances identified in Code section 124.204(9), or unlawfully
 17 13 acts with, enters into a common scheme or design with, or
 17 14 conspires with one or more persons to manufacture, deliver,
 17 15 or possess such imitation controlled substances, the person
 17 16 commits the following offense: a class "B" felony punishable
 17 17 by confinement of no more than 50 years and a fine of not more
 17 18 than $1 million if the imitation controlled substance is more
 17 19 than 10 kilograms; a class "B" felony punishable by confinement
 17 20 of no more than 25 years and a fine of not less than $5,000 but
 17 21 not more than $100,000 if the imitation controlled substance
 17 22 is more than five kilograms but not more than 10 kilograms; a
 17 23 class "C" felony punishable by a fine of not less than $1,000
 17 24 but not more than $50,000 if the imitation controlled substance
 17 25 is five kilograms or less; or an aggravated misdemeanor if the
 17 26 imitation controlled substance is classified in schedule IV or
 17 27 V; or a serious misdemeanor for a first possession offense,
 17 28 an aggravated misdemeanor for a second possession offense,
 17 29 or a class "D" felony for two or more previous possession
 17 30 offenses. Current law in Code section 124A.4 provides that if
 17 31 a person unlawfully manufactures, delivers, or possesses with
 17 32 intent to deliver an imitation controlled substance, the person
 17 33 commits an aggravated misdemeanor, or if the person delivers
 17 34 to a person under 18 years of age who is at least three years
 17 35 younger than the violator, the person commits a class "D"
 18  1 felony.  In addition, under current law, if a person unlawfully
 18  2 and knowingly publishes an advertisement or distributes in a
 18  3 public place a promotion for an imitation controlled substance
 18  4 the person commits a serious misdemeanor.
 18  5    The bill enhances the criminal penalties for controlled
 18  6 substances classified in Code sections 124.204(4)(ai) and
 18  7 124.204(6)(i) from an aggravated misdemeanor to a class "C"
 18  8 felony punishable pursuant to Code section 124.401(1)(c)(8).
 18  9 This change equalizes the criminal penalties with violations
 18 10 involving other schedule I controlled substances.
 18 11    The bill provides that if the same person commits two or
 18 12 more acts which are in violation of Code section 124.401(1)
 18 13 and the acts occur in the same location or time period so the
 18 14 acts are attributable to a single scheme, the acts may be
 18 15 considered a single violation and the weights of the imitation
 18 16 controlled substance may be combined for purposes of charging
 18 17 the offender.
 18 18    The amendment to Code section 124.401A provides that
 18 19 a person who is 18 years of age or older who unlawfully
 18 20 manufactures with the intent to distribute, distributes,
 18 21 or possesses with the intent to distribute an imitation
 18 22 controlled substance to another person 18 years of age or older
 18 23 within 1,000 feet of the real property comprising a public or
 18 24 nonpublic school, may be sentenced up to an additional term of
 18 25 confinement of five years in addition to any other penalty.
 18 26    The amendment to Code section 124.401B provides that
 18 27 a person who unlawfully possesses an imitation controlled
 18 28 substance within 1,000 feet of the real property comprising a
 18 29 school, public park, public pool, public recreation center, or
 18 30 marked school bus may be sentenced up to 100 hours of community
 18 31 service.
 18 32    The amendments to Code section 124.406 relate to the
 18 33 distribution or possession with the intent to distribute an
 18 34 imitation controlled substance to a person under 18 years of
 18 35 age.  A person who distributes or possesses with the intent to
 19  1 distribute an imitation controlled substance, represented to
 19  2 be a substance listed in schedule I or schedule II, to a person
 19  3 under 18 years of age commits a class "B" felony. The required
 19  4 penalty for such a violation is a minimum term of confinement
 19  5 of 10 years if the substance was distributed within 1,000
 19  6 feet of the real property comprising a public or nonpublic
 19  7 school, public park, public pool, or public recreation center.
 19  8 A person who distributes or possesses with the intent to
 19  9 distribute an imitation controlled substance, represented to be
 19 10 a substance listed in schedule III, to a person under 18 years
 19 11 of age, who is at least three years younger than the violator,
 19 12 commits a class "C" felony.  A person who distributes or
 19 13 possesses with the intent to distribute an imitation controlled
 19 14 substance, represented to be a substance listed in schedule
 19 15 IV or schedule V, to a person under 18 years of age, who is
 19 16 at least three years younger than the violator, commits an
 19 17 aggravated misdemeanor.
 19 18    The amendment to Code section 124.415 requires that a peace
 19 19 officer make a reasonable effort to identify a person under 18
 19 20 years of age discovered to be in possession of an imitation
 19 21 controlled substance, and if the person is not referred to
 19 22 juvenile court, the peace officer shall make a reasonable
 19 23 effort to notify the person's custodial parent of the
 19 24 possession unless the officer has reasonable grounds to believe
 19 25 such notification is not in the best interests of the person.
 19 26 The bill specifies that if the person is taken into custody
 19 27 the juvenile court officer shall make a reasonable effort to
 19 28 identify the school of attendance and to notify the school or
 19 29 nonpublic school of the taking into custody of the person.
 19 30    The bill creates Code section 124.417, which is similar to
 19 31 Code section 124A.5 repealed by the bill.  A person registered
 19 32 under Code section 124.302 does not violate the bill if the
 19 33 person manufactures, delivers, possesses, or possesses with the
 19 34 intent to manufacture or deliver, or acts with others to do
 19 35 such activities, if the person uses the imitation controlled
 20  1 substance for use as a placebo by a registered practitioner in
 20  2 the court of professional practice or research.
 20  3    SCHEDULE I, III, AND IV CONTROLLED SUBSTANCES.  The bill
 20  4 transfers numerous substances classified as "hallucinogenic
 20  5 substances" under schedule I and reclassifies the substances
 20  6 as "other substances" under schedule I.  By transferring the
 20  7 substances to "other substances", a person commits a class "C"
 20  8 felony under Code section 124.401(1)(c)(8) if the violation
 20  9 involves such a substance. Under current law, a person commits
 20 10 an aggravated misdemeanor under Code section 124.401(1)(d) when
 20 11 committing such violations.
 20 12    The bill adds new substances as "hallucinogenic substances"
 20 13 under schedule I.  A person commits a class "C" felony under
 20 14 Code section 124.401(1)(c)(8) if the violation involves the new
 20 15 hallucinogenic substances.
 20 16    The bill adds new substances as "stimulants" under schedule
 20 17 I.  A person commits a class "C" felony under Code section
 20 18 124.401(1)(c)(8) if the violation involves the new stimulant
 20 19 substances.
 20 20    The bill also adds new substances to the classification of
 20 21 "other substances" under schedule I.  A person commits a class
 20 22 "C" felony under Code section 124.401(1)(c)(8) for a violation
 20 23 involving the new substances.
 20 24    The bill strikes one substance classified as a
 20 25 "hallucinogenic substance" under schedule I and reclassifies
 20 26 the substance as a "stimulant" containing a synthetic cathinone
 20 27 under schedule I.  The transfer of the substance within
 20 28 schedule I also changes the criminal penalty for a violation
 20 29 involving the substance from a class "C" felony under Code
 20 30 section 124.401(1)(c)(8) to an aggravated misdemeanor under
 20 31 Code section 124.401(1)(d).  The bill also strikes a substance
 20 32 in Code section 124.204(6)(i)(3) from schedule I and does not
 20 33 reclassify the substance in any other substance schedule.
 20 34    The bill also removes numerous substances from schedule I
 20 35 which are currently classified as "stimulants" in Code section
 21  1 124.204(6)(i).
 21  2    The bill also strikes two narcotic substances from schedule
 21  3 III and adds three substances to schedule IV.  A violation
 21  4 involving a schedule IV controlled substance is punishable as
 21  5 an aggravated misdemeanor in Code section 124.401(1)(d).

 15 30    COCAINE BASE.  The bill increases the amounts of controlled
 15 31 substances containing cocaine base (crack cocaine) that
 15 32 determine the criminal penalty for certain offenses.  Under
 15 33 the bill, if a person unlawfully manufactures, delivers, or
 15 34 possesses with the intent to deliver a controlled substance
 15 35 containing cocaine base, or unlawfully acts with, enters into
 16  1 a common scheme or design with, or conspires with one or more
 16  2 persons to manufacture, deliver, or possess such a controlled
 16  3 substance, the person commits the following offenses: a class
 16  4 "B" felony punishable by confinement of no more than 50 years
 16  5 and a fine of not more than $1 million if the controlled
 16  6 substance containing cocaine base is more than 125 grams rather
 16  7 than the current 50 grams; a class "B" felony punishable by
 16  8 confinement of no more than 25 years and a fine of not less than
 16  9 $5,000 but not more than $100,000 if the imitation controlled
 16 10 substance is more than 35 grams but not more than 125 grams
 16 11 rather than the current 10 to 50 grams; or a class "C" felony
 16 12 punishable by a fine of not less than $1,000 but not more than
 16 13 $50,000 if the controlled substance containing cocaine base is
 16 14 35 grams or less rather than the current 10 grams or less.
 16 15    IMITATION CONTROLLED SUBSTANCES.  Under current law
 16 16 imitation controlled substances are regulated under Code
 16 17 chapter 124A.  The bill repeals Code chapter 124A and transfers
 16 18 the regulation of imitation controlled substances to Code
 16 19 chapter 124.  The definition and designation of an imitation
 16 20 controlled substance in Code chapter 124 remains identical
 16 21 to the definition and designation of an imitation controlled
 16 22 substance under current law in Code chapter 124A.
 16 23    Under the bill and in current law, an imitation controlled
 16 24 substance means a substance which is not a controlled substance
 16 25 but by color, shape, size, markings, and other aspects of
 16 26 dosage unit appearance, and packaging or other factors, appears
 16 27 to be or resembles a controlled substance. The board of
 16 28 pharmacy may designate a substance as an imitation controlled
 16 29 substance pursuant to the board's rulemaking authority and in
 16 30 accordance with Code chapter 17A.
 16 31    In addition, under current law and in the bill, if a
 16 32 substance has not been designated as an imitation controlled
 16 33 substance by the board of pharmacy and when dosage unit
 16 34 appearance alone does not establish that a substance is an
 16 35 imitation controlled substance, the following factors may
 17  1 be considered in determining whether the substance is an
 17  2 imitation controlled substance: the substance is represented
 17  3 as having the effect of a controlled substance; the substance
 17  4 is represented as a controlled substance or as a substitute for
 17  5 a controlled substance because of its nature or appearance;
 17  6 or a person receives money or other property having a value
 17  7 substantially greater than the actual value of the substance
 17  8 when sold.
 17  9    Under the bill, if a person unlawfully manufactures,
 17 10 delivers, or possesses with the intent to deliver an imitation
 17 11 controlled substance containing any detectable amount of those
 17 12 substances identified in Code section 124.204(9), or unlawfully
 17 13 acts with, enters into a common scheme or design with, or
 17 14 conspires with one or more persons to manufacture, deliver,
 17 15 or possess such imitation controlled substances, the person
 17 16 commits the following offense: a class "B" felony punishable
 17 17 by confinement of no more than 50 years and a fine of not more
 17 18 than $1 million if the imitation controlled substance is more
 17 19 than 10 kilograms; a class "B" felony punishable by confinement
 17 20 of no more than 25 years and a fine of not less than $5,000 but
 17 21 not more than $100,000 if the imitation controlled substance

 17 31 a person unlawfully manufactures, delivers, or possesses with
 17 32 intent to deliver an imitation controlled substance, the person
 17 33 commits an aggravated misdemeanor, or if the person delivers
 17 34 to a person under 18 years of age who is at least three years

 18  9 This change equalizes the criminal penalties with violations
 18 10 involving other schedule I controlled substances.
 18 11    The bill provides that if the same person commits two or

 18 13 and the acts occur in the same location or time period so the
 18 14 acts are attributable to a single scheme, the acts may be

 18 22 controlled substance to another person 18 years of age or older
 18 23 within 1,000 feet of the real property comprising a public or

 18 32    The amendments to Code section 124.406 relate to the
 18 33 distribution or possession with the intent to distribute an
 18 34 imitation controlled substance to a person under 18 years of
 18 35 age.  A person who distributes or possesses with the intent to
 19  1 distribute an imitation controlled substance, represented to
 19  2 be a substance listed in schedule I or schedule II, to a person
 19  3 under 18 years of age commits a class "B" felony. The required
 19  4 penalty for such a violation is a minimum term of confinement
 19  5 of 10 years if the substance was distributed within 1,000
 19  6 feet of the real property comprising a public or nonpublic
 19  7 school, public park, public pool, or public recreation center.
 19  8 A person who distributes or possesses with the intent to

 19 10 a substance listed in schedule III, to a person under 18 years
 19 11 of age, who is at least three years younger than the violator,
 19 12 commits a class "C" felony.  A person who distributes or

 19 14 substance, represented to be a substance listed in schedule
 19 15 IV or schedule V, to a person under 18 years of age, who is
 19 16 at least three years younger than the violator, commits an
 19 17 aggravated misdemeanor.
 19 18    The amendment to Code section 124.415 requires that a peace
 19 19 officer make a reasonable effort to identify a person under 18
 19 20 years of age discovered to be in possession of an imitation
 19 21 controlled substance, and if the person is not referred to
 19 22 juvenile court, the peace officer shall make a reasonable
 19 23 effort to notify the person's custodial parent of the
 19 24 possession unless the officer has reasonable grounds to believe
 19 25 such notification is not in the best interests of the person.

 19 27 the juvenile court officer shall make a reasonable effort to

 19 29 nonpublic school of the taking into custody of the person.
 19 30    The bill creates Code section 124.417, which is similar to
 19 31 Code section 124A.5 repealed by the bill.  A person registered
 19 32 under Code section 124.302 does not violate the bill if the
 19 33 person manufactures, delivers, possesses, or possesses with the
 19 34 intent to manufacture or deliver, or acts with others to do
 19 35 such activities, if the person uses the imitation controlled
 20  1 substance for use as a placebo by a registered practitioner in
 20  2 the court of professional practice or research.
 20  3    SCHEDULE I, III, AND IV CONTROLLED SUBSTANCES.  The bill
 20  4 transfers numerous substances classified as "hallucinogenic
 20  5 substances" under schedule I and reclassifies the substances
 20  6 as "other substances" under schedule I.  By transferring the
 20  7 substances to "other substances", a person commits a class "C"
 20  8 felony under Code section 124.401(1)(c)(8) if the violation
 20  9 involves such a substance. Under current law, a person commits
 20 10 an aggravated misdemeanor under Code section 124.401(1)(d) when
 20 11 committing such violations.
 20 12    The bill adds new substances as "hallucinogenic substances"
 20 13 under schedule I.  A person commits a class "C" felony under
 20 14 Code section 124.401(1)(c)(8) if the violation involves the new
 20 15 hallucinogenic substances.
 20 16    The bill adds new substances as "stimulants" under schedule
 20 17 I.  A person commits a class "C" felony under Code section
 20 18 124.401(1)(c)(8) if the violation involves the new stimulant
 20 19 substances.
 20 20    The bill also adds new substances to the classification of
 20 21 "other substances" under schedule I.  A person commits a class
 20 22 "C" felony under Code section 124.401(1)(c)(8) for a violation
 20 23 involving the new substances.
 20 24    The bill strikes one substance classified as a
 20 25 "hallucinogenic substance" under schedule I and reclassifies
 20 26 the substance as a "stimulant" containing a synthetic cathinone
 20 27 under schedule I.  The transfer of the substance within
 20 28 schedule I also changes the criminal penalty for a violation
 20 29 involving the substance from a class "C" felony under Code
 20 30 section 124.401(1)(c)(8) to an aggravated misdemeanor under
 20 31 Code section 124.401(1)(d).  The bill also strikes a substance
 20 32 in Code section 124.204(6)(i)(3) from schedule I and does not
 20 33 reclassify the substance in any other substance schedule.
 20 34    The bill also removes numerous substances from schedule I
 20 35 which are currently classified as "stimulants" in Code section
 21  1 124.204(6)(i).
 21  2    The bill also strikes two narcotic substances from schedule
 21  3 III and adds three substances to schedule IV.  A violation
 21  4 involving a schedule IV controlled substance is punishable as
 21  5 an aggravated misdemeanor in Code section 124.401(1)(d).

 15 25    Current law provides that if within 60 days after the next
 15 26 general assembly convenes the general assembly has not made
 15 27 the corresponding changes in Code chapter 124, the temporary
 15 28 designation that the substance is a controlled substance is
 15 29 nullified.
 15 30    COCAINE BASE.  The bill increases the amounts of controlled
 15 31 substances containing cocaine base (crack cocaine) that
 15 32 determine the criminal penalty for certain offenses.  Under
 15 33 the bill, if a person unlawfully manufactures, delivers, or
 15 34 possesses with the intent to deliver a controlled substance
 15 35 containing cocaine base, or unlawfully acts with, enters into
 16  1 a common scheme or design with, or conspires with one or more
 16  2 persons to manufacture, deliver, or possess such a controlled
 16  3 substance, the person commits the following offenses: a class
 16  4 "B" felony punishable by confinement of no more than 50 years
 16  5 and a fine of not more than $1 million if the controlled
 16  6 substance containing cocaine base is more than 125 grams rather
 16  7 than the current 50 grams; a class "B" felony punishable by
 16  8 confinement of no more than 25 years and a fine of not less than
 16  9 $5,000 but not more than $100,000 if the imitation controlled
 16 10 substance is more than 35 grams but not more than 125 grams
 16 11 rather than the current 10 to 50 grams; or a class "C" felony
 16 12 punishable by a fine of not less than $1,000 but not more than
 16 13 $50,000 if the controlled substance containing cocaine base is
 16 14 35 grams or less rather than the current 10 grams or less.
 16 15    IMITATION CONTROLLED SUBSTANCES.  Under current law
 16 16 imitation controlled substances are regulated under Code
 16 17 chapter 124A.  The bill repeals Code chapter 124A and transfers
 16 18 the regulation of imitation controlled substances to Code
 16 19 chapter 124.  The definition and designation of an imitation
 16 20 controlled substance in Code chapter 124 remains identical
 16 21 to the definition and designation of an imitation controlled
 16 22 substance under current law in Code chapter 124A.
 16 23    Under the bill and in current law, an imitation controlled
 16 24 substance means a substance which is not a controlled substance
 16 25 but by color, shape, size, markings, and other aspects of
 16 26 dosage unit appearance, and packaging or other factors, appears
 16 27 to be or resembles a controlled substance. The board of
 16 28 pharmacy may designate a substance as an imitation controlled
 16 29 substance pursuant to the board's rulemaking authority and in
 16 30 accordance with Code chapter 17A.
 16 31    In addition, under current law and in the bill, if a
 16 32 substance has not been designated as an imitation controlled
 16 33 substance by the board of pharmacy and when dosage unit
 16 34 appearance alone does not establish that a substance is an
 16 35 imitation controlled substance, the following factors may
 17  1 be considered in determining whether the substance is an
 17  2 imitation controlled substance: the substance is represented
 17  3 as having the effect of a controlled substance; the substance
 17  4 is represented as a controlled substance or as a substitute for
 17  5 a controlled substance because of its nature or appearance;
 17  6 or a person receives money or other property having a value
 17  7 substantially greater than the actual value of the substance
 17  8 when sold.
 17  9    Under the bill, if a person unlawfully manufactures,
 17 10 delivers, or possesses with the intent to deliver an imitation
 17 11 controlled substance containing any detectable amount of those
 17 12 substances identified in Code section 124.204(9), or unlawfully
 17 13 acts with, enters into a common scheme or design with, or
 17 14 conspires with one or more persons to manufacture, deliver,
 17 15 or possess such imitation controlled substances, the person
 17 16 commits the following offense: a class "B" felony punishable
 17 17 by confinement of no more than 50 years and a fine of not more
 17 18 than $1 million if the imitation controlled substance is more
 17 19 than 10 kilograms; a class "B" felony punishable by confinement
 17 20 of no more than 25 years and a fine of not less than $5,000 but
 17 21 not more than $100,000 if the imitation controlled substance
 17 22 is more than five kilograms but not more than 10 kilograms; a
 17 23 class "C" felony punishable by a fine of not less than $1,000
 17 24 but not more than $50,000 if the imitation controlled substance
 17 25 is five kilograms or less; or an aggravated misdemeanor if the
 17 26 imitation controlled substance is classified in schedule IV or
 17 27 V; or a serious misdemeanor for a first possession offense,
 17 28 an aggravated misdemeanor for a second possession offense,
 17 29 or a class "D" felony for two or more previous possession
 17 30 offenses. Current law in Code section 124A.4 provides that if
 17 31 a person unlawfully manufactures, delivers, or possesses with
 17 32 intent to deliver an imitation controlled substance, the person
 17 33 commits an aggravated misdemeanor, or if the person delivers
 17 34 to a person under 18 years of age who is at least three years
 17 35 younger than the violator, the person commits a class "D"
 18  1 felony.  In addition, under current law, if a person unlawfully
 18  2 and knowingly publishes an advertisement or distributes in a
 18  3 public place a promotion for an imitation controlled substance
 18  4 the person commits a serious misdemeanor.
 18  5    The bill enhances the criminal penalties for controlled
 18  6 substances classified in Code sections 124.204(4)(ai) and
 18  7 124.204(6)(i) from an aggravated misdemeanor to a class "C"
 18  8 felony punishable pursuant to Code section 124.401(1)(c)(8).
 18  9 This change equalizes the criminal penalties with violations
 18 10 involving other schedule I controlled substances.
 18 11    The bill provides that if the same person commits two or
 18 12 more acts which are in violation of Code section 124.401(1)
 18 13 and the acts occur in the same location or time period so the
 18 14 acts are attributable to a single scheme, the acts may be
 18 15 considered a single violation and the weights of the imitation
 18 16 controlled substance may be combined for purposes of charging
 18 17 the offender.
 18 18    The amendment to Code section 124.401A provides that
 18 19 a person who is 18 years of age or older who unlawfully
 18 20 manufactures with the intent to distribute, distributes,
 18 21 or possesses with the intent to distribute an imitation
 18 22 controlled substance to another person 18 years of age or older
 18 23 within 1,000 feet of the real property comprising a public or
 18 24 nonpublic school, may be sentenced up to an additional term of
 18 25 confinement of five years in addition to any other penalty.
 18 26    The amendment to Code section 124.401B provides that
 18 27 a person who unlawfully possesses an imitation controlled
 18 28 substance within 1,000 feet of the real property comprising a
 18 29 school, public park, public pool, public recreation center, or
 18 30 marked school bus may be sentenced up to 100 hours of community
 18 31 service.
 18 32    The amendments to Code section 124.406 relate to the
 18 33 distribution or possession with the intent to distribute an
 18 34 imitation controlled substance to a person under 18 years of
 18 35 age.  A person who distributes or possesses with the intent to
 19  1 distribute an imitation controlled substance, represented to
 19  2 be a substance listed in schedule I or schedule II, to a person
 19  3 under 18 years of age commits a class "B" felony. The required
 19  4 penalty for such a violation is a minimum term of confinement
 19  5 of 10 years if the substance was distributed within 1,000
 19  6 feet of the real property comprising a public or nonpublic
 19  7 school, public park, public pool, or public recreation center.
 19  8 A person who distributes or possesses with the intent to
 19  9 distribute an imitation controlled substance, represented to be
 19 10 a substance listed in schedule III, to a person under 18 years
 19 11 of age, who is at least three years younger than the violator,
 19 12 commits a class "C" felony.  A person who distributes or
 19 13 possesses with the intent to distribute an imitation controlled
 19 14 substance, represented to be a substance listed in schedule
 19 15 IV or schedule V, to a person under 18 years of age, who is
 19 16 at least three years younger than the violator, commits an
 19 17 aggravated misdemeanor.
 19 18    The amendment to Code section 124.415 requires that a peace
 19 19 officer make a reasonable effort to identify a person under 18
 19 20 years of age discovered to be in possession of an imitation
 19 21 controlled substance, and if the person is not referred to
 19 22 juvenile court, the peace officer shall make a reasonable
 19 23 effort to notify the person's custodial parent of the
 19 24 possession unless the officer has reasonable grounds to believe
 19 25 such notification is not in the best interests of the person.
 19 26 The bill specifies that if the person is taken into custody
 19 27 the juvenile court officer shall make a reasonable effort to
 19 28 identify the school of attendance and to notify the school or
 19 29 nonpublic school of the taking into custody of the person.
 19 30    The bill creates Code section 124.417, which is similar to
 19 31 Code section 124A.5 repealed by the bill.  A person registered
 19 32 under Code section 124.302 does not violate the bill if the
 19 33 person manufactures, delivers, possesses, or possesses with the
 19 34 intent to manufacture or deliver, or acts with others to do
 19 35 such activities, if the person uses the imitation controlled
 20  1 substance for use as a placebo by a registered practitioner in
 20  2 the court of professional practice or research.
 20  3    SCHEDULE I, III, AND IV CONTROLLED SUBSTANCES.  The bill
 20  4 transfers numerous substances classified as "hallucinogenic
 20  5 substances" under schedule I and reclassifies the substances
 20  6 as "other substances" under schedule I.  By transferring the
 20  7 substances to "other substances", a person commits a class "C"
 20  8 felony under Code section 124.401(1)(c)(8) if the violation
 20  9 involves such a substance. Under current law, a person commits
 20 10 an aggravated misdemeanor under Code section 124.401(1)(d) when
 20 11 committing such violations.
 20 12    The bill adds new substances as "hallucinogenic substances"
 20 13 under schedule I.  A person commits a class "C" felony under
 20 14 Code section 124.401(1)(c)(8) if the violation involves the new
 20 15 hallucinogenic substances.
 20 16    The bill adds new substances as "stimulants" under schedule
 20 17 I.  A person commits a class "C" felony under Code section
 20 18 124.401(1)(c)(8) if the violation involves the new stimulant
 20 19 substances.
 20 20    The bill also adds new substances to the classification of
 20 21 "other substances" under schedule I.  A person commits a class
 20 22 "C" felony under Code section 124.401(1)(c)(8) for a violation
 20 23 involving the new substances.
 20 24    The bill strikes one substance classified as a
 20 25 "hallucinogenic substance" under schedule I and reclassifies
 20 26 the substance as a "stimulant" containing a synthetic cathinone
 20 27 under schedule I.  The transfer of the substance within
 20 28 schedule I also changes the criminal penalty for a violation
 20 29 involving the substance from a class "C" felony under Code
 20 30 section 124.401(1)(c)(8) to an aggravated misdemeanor under
 20 31 Code section 124.401(1)(d).  The bill also strikes a substance
 20 32 in Code section 124.204(6)(i)(3) from schedule I and does not
 20 33 reclassify the substance in any other substance schedule.
 20 34    The bill also removes numerous substances from schedule I
 20 35 which are currently classified as "stimulants" in Code section
 21  1 124.204(6)(i).
 21  2    The bill also strikes two narcotic substances from schedule
 21  3 III and adds three substances to schedule IV.  A violation
 21  4 involving a schedule IV controlled substance is punishable as

 15 30    COCAINE BASE.  The bill increases the amounts of controlled
 15 31 substances containing cocaine base (crack cocaine) that
 15 32 determine the criminal penalty for certain offenses.  Under
 15 33 the bill, if a person unlawfully manufactures, delivers, or
 15 34 possesses with the intent to deliver a controlled substance
 15 35 containing cocaine base, or unlawfully acts with, enters into
 16  1 a common scheme or design with, or conspires with one or more
 16  2 persons to manufacture, deliver, or possess such a controlled
 16  3 substance, the person commits the following offenses: a class
 16  4 "B" felony punishable by confinement of no more than 50 years
 16  5 and a fine of not more than $1 million if the controlled
 16  6 substance containing cocaine base is more than 125 grams rather
 16  7 than the current 50 grams; a class "B" felony punishable by
 16  8 confinement of no more than 25 years and a fine of not less than

 16 12 punishable by a fine of not less than $1,000 but not more than
 16 13 $50,000 if the controlled substance containing cocaine base is
 16 14 35 grams or less rather than the current 10 grams or less.
 16 15    IMITATION CONTROLLED SUBSTANCES.  Under current law
 16 16 imitation controlled substances are regulated under Code
 16 17 chapter 124A.  The bill repeals Code chapter 124A and transfers
 16 18 the regulation of imitation controlled substances to Code
 16 19 chapter 124.  The definition and designation of an imitation
 16 20 controlled substance in Code chapter 124 remains identical
 16 21 to the definition and designation of an imitation controlled
 16 22 substance under current law in Code chapter 124A.
 16 23    Under the bill and in current law, an imitation controlled
 16 24 substance means a substance which is not a controlled substance
 16 25 but by color, shape, size, markings, and other aspects of
 16 26 dosage unit appearance, and packaging or other factors, appears
 16 27 to be or resembles a controlled substance. The board of
 16 28 pharmacy may designate a substance as an imitation controlled
 16 29 substance pursuant to the board's rulemaking authority and in
 16 30 accordance with Code chapter 17A.
 16 31    In addition, under current law and in the bill, if a
 16 32 substance has not been designated as an imitation controlled
 16 33 substance by the board of pharmacy and when dosage unit
 16 34 appearance alone does not establish that a substance is an
 16 35 imitation controlled substance, the following factors may
 17  1 be considered in determining whether the substance is an
 17  2 imitation controlled substance: the substance is represented
 17  3 as having the effect of a controlled substance; the substance
 17  4 is represented as a controlled substance or as a substitute for
 17  5 a controlled substance because of its nature or appearance;
 17  6 or a person receives money or other property having a value
 17  7 substantially greater than the actual value of the substance
 17  8 when sold.
 17  9    Under the bill, if a person unlawfully manufactures,
 17 10 delivers, or possesses with the intent to deliver an imitation
 17 11 controlled substance containing any detectable amount of those
 17 12 substances identified in Code section 124.204(9), or unlawfully
 17 13 acts with, enters into a common scheme or design with, or
 17 14 conspires with one or more persons to manufacture, deliver,
 17 15 or possess such imitation controlled substances, the person
 17 16 commits the following offense: a class "B" felony punishable
 17 17 by confinement of no more than 50 years and a fine of not more
 17 18 than $1 million if the imitation controlled substance is more
 17 19 than 10 kilograms; a class "B" felony punishable by confinement
 17 20 of no more than 25 years and a fine of not less than $5,000 but
 17 21 not more than $100,000 if the imitation controlled substance
 17 22 is more than five kilograms but not more than 10 kilograms; a

 17 31 a person unlawfully manufactures, delivers, or possesses with
 17 32 intent to deliver an imitation controlled substance, the person
 17 33 commits an aggravated misdemeanor, or if the person delivers
 17 34 to a person under 18 years of age who is at least three years
 17 35 younger than the violator, the person commits a class "D"
 18  1 felony.  In addition, under current law, if a person unlawfully
 18  2 and knowingly publishes an advertisement or distributes in a
 18  3 public place a promotion for an imitation controlled substance
 18  4 the person commits a serious misdemeanor.
 18  5    The bill enhances the criminal penalties for controlled

 18  9 This change equalizes the criminal penalties with violations
 18 10 involving other schedule I controlled substances.
 18 11    The bill provides that if the same person commits two or

 18 22 controlled substance to another person 18 years of age or older
 18 23 within 1,000 feet of the real property comprising a public or
 18 24 nonpublic school, may be sentenced up to an additional term of
 18 25 confinement of five years in addition to any other penalty.
 18 26    The amendment to Code section 124.401B provides that

 18 32    The amendments to Code section 124.406 relate to the
 18 33 distribution or possession with the intent to distribute an
 18 34 imitation controlled substance to a person under 18 years of
 18 35 age.  A person who distributes or possesses with the intent to
 19  1 distribute an imitation controlled substance, represented to
 19  2 be a substance listed in schedule I or schedule II, to a person
 19  3 under 18 years of age commits a class "B" felony. The required
 19  4 penalty for such a violation is a minimum term of confinement
 19  5 of 10 years if the substance was distributed within 1,000
 19  6 feet of the real property comprising a public or nonpublic
 19  7 school, public park, public pool, or public recreation center.
 19  8 A person who distributes or possesses with the intent to
 19  9 distribute an imitation controlled substance, represented to be
 19 10 a substance listed in schedule III, to a person under 18 years
 19 11 of age, who is at least three years younger than the violator,
 19 12 commits a class "C" felony.  A person who distributes or
 19 13 possesses with the intent to distribute an imitation controlled
 19 14 substance, represented to be a substance listed in schedule
 19 15 IV or schedule V, to a person under 18 years of age, who is
 19 16 at least three years younger than the violator, commits an
 19 17 aggravated misdemeanor.
 19 18    The amendment to Code section 124.415 requires that a peace
 19 19 officer make a reasonable effort to identify a person under 18
 19 20 years of age discovered to be in possession of an imitation
 19 21 controlled substance, and if the person is not referred to
 19 22 juvenile court, the peace officer shall make a reasonable
 19 23 effort to notify the person's custodial parent of the
 19 24 possession unless the officer has reasonable grounds to believe
 19 25 such notification is not in the best interests of the person.

 19 27 the juvenile court officer shall make a reasonable effort to

 19 30    The bill creates Code section 124.417, which is similar to
 19 31 Code section 124A.5 repealed by the bill.  A person registered
 19 32 under Code section 124.302 does not violate the bill if the
 19 33 person manufactures, delivers, possesses, or possesses with the
 19 34 intent to manufacture or deliver, or acts with others to do
 19 35 such activities, if the person uses the imitation controlled
 20  1 substance for use as a placebo by a registered practitioner in
 20  2 the court of professional practice or research.
 20  3    SCHEDULE I, III, AND IV CONTROLLED SUBSTANCES.  The bill
 20  4 transfers numerous substances classified as "hallucinogenic
 20  5 substances" under schedule I and reclassifies the substances
 20  6 as "other substances" under schedule I.  By transferring the
 20  7 substances to "other substances", a person commits a class "C"
 20  8 felony under Code section 124.401(1)(c)(8) if the violation
 20  9 involves such a substance. Under current law, a person commits
 20 10 an aggravated misdemeanor under Code section 124.401(1)(d) when
 20 11 committing such violations.
 20 12    The bill adds new substances as "hallucinogenic substances"
 20 13 under schedule I.  A person commits a class "C" felony under
 20 14 Code section 124.401(1)(c)(8) if the violation involves the new
 20 15 hallucinogenic substances.
 20 16    The bill adds new substances as "stimulants" under schedule
 20 17 I.  A person commits a class "C" felony under Code section
 20 18 124.401(1)(c)(8) if the violation involves the new stimulant
 20 19 substances.
 20 20    The bill also adds new substances to the classification of
 20 21 "other substances" under schedule I.  A person commits a class
 20 22 "C" felony under Code section 124.401(1)(c)(8) for a violation
 20 23 involving the new substances.
 20 24    The bill strikes one substance classified as a
 20 25 "hallucinogenic substance" under schedule I and reclassifies
 20 26 the substance as a "stimulant" containing a synthetic cathinone
 20 27 under schedule I.  The transfer of the substance within
 20 28 schedule I also changes the criminal penalty for a violation
 20 29 involving the substance from a class "C" felony under Code
 20 30 section 124.401(1)(c)(8) to an aggravated misdemeanor under
 20 31 Code section 124.401(1)(d).  The bill also strikes a substance
 20 32 in Code section 124.204(6)(i)(3) from schedule I and does not
 20 33 reclassify the substance in any other substance schedule.

 20 35 which are currently classified as "stimulants" in Code section
 21  1 124.204(6)(i).
 21  2    The bill also strikes two narcotic substances from schedule
 21  3 III and adds three substances to schedule IV.  A violation

 15 26 general assembly convenes the general assembly has not made
 15 27 the corresponding changes in Code chapter 124, the temporary
 15 28 designation that the substance is a controlled substance is

 15 30    COCAINE BASE.  The bill increases the amounts of controlled
 15 31 substances containing cocaine base (crack cocaine) that
 15 32 determine the criminal penalty for certain offenses.  Under
 15 33 the bill, if a person unlawfully manufactures, delivers, or
 15 34 possesses with the intent to deliver a controlled substance
 15 35 containing cocaine base, or unlawfully acts with, enters into
 16  1 a common scheme or design with, or conspires with one or more
 16  2 persons to manufacture, deliver, or possess such a controlled
 16  3 substance, the person commits the following offenses: a class
 16  4 "B" felony punishable by confinement of no more than 50 years
 16  5 and a fine of not more than $1 million if the controlled
 16  6 substance containing cocaine base is more than 125 grams rather
 16  7 than the current 50 grams; a class "B" felony punishable by
 16  8 confinement of no more than 25 years and a fine of not less than
 16  9 $5,000 but not more than $100,000 if the imitation controlled
 16 10 substance is more than 35 grams but not more than 125 grams
 16 11 rather than the current 10 to 50 grams; or a class "C" felony
 16 12 punishable by a fine of not less than $1,000 but not more than
 16 13 $50,000 if the controlled substance containing cocaine base is
 16 14 35 grams or less rather than the current 10 grams or less.
 16 15    IMITATION CONTROLLED SUBSTANCES.  Under current law
 16 16 imitation controlled substances are regulated under Code
 16 17 chapter 124A.  The bill repeals Code chapter 124A and transfers
 16 18 the regulation of imitation controlled substances to Code
 16 19 chapter 124.  The definition and designation of an imitation
 16 20 controlled substance in Code chapter 124 remains identical
 16 21 to the definition and designation of an imitation controlled
 16 22 substance under current law in Code chapter 124A.
 16 23    Under the bill and in current law, an imitation controlled
 16 24 substance means a substance which is not a controlled substance
 16 25 but by color, shape, size, markings, and other aspects of
 16 26 dosage unit appearance, and packaging or other factors, appears
 16 27 to be or resembles a controlled substance. The board of
 16 28 pharmacy may designate a substance as an imitation controlled
 16 29 substance pursuant to the board's rulemaking authority and in
 16 30 accordance with Code chapter 17A.
 16 31    In addition, under current law and in the bill, if a
 16 32 substance has not been designated as an imitation controlled
 16 33 substance by the board of pharmacy and when dosage unit
 16 34 appearance alone does not establish that a substance is an
 16 35 imitation controlled substance, the following factors may
 17  1 be considered in determining whether the substance is an
 17  2 imitation controlled substance: the substance is represented
 17  3 as having the effect of a controlled substance; the substance
 17  4 is represented as a controlled substance or as a substitute for
 17  5 a controlled substance because of its nature or appearance;
 17  6 or a person receives money or other property having a value
 17  7 substantially greater than the actual value of the substance
 17  8 when sold.
 17  9    Under the bill, if a person unlawfully manufactures,
 17 10 delivers, or possesses with the intent to deliver an imitation
 17 11 controlled substance containing any detectable amount of those
 17 12 substances identified in Code section 124.204(9), or unlawfully
 17 13 acts with, enters into a common scheme or design with, or
 17 14 conspires with one or more persons to manufacture, deliver,
 17 15 or possess such imitation controlled substances, the person
 17 16 commits the following offense: a class "B" felony punishable
 17 17 by confinement of no more than 50 years and a fine of not more
 17 18 than $1 million if the imitation controlled substance is more
 17 19 than 10 kilograms; a class "B" felony punishable by confinement
 17 20 of no more than 25 years and a fine of not less than $5,000 but
 17 21 not more than $100,000 if the imitation controlled substance
 17 22 is more than five kilograms but not more than 10 kilograms; a
 17 23 class "C" felony punishable by a fine of not less than $1,000
 17 24 but not more than $50,000 if the imitation controlled substance
 17 25 is five kilograms or less; or an aggravated misdemeanor if the
 17 26 imitation controlled substance is classified in schedule IV or
 17 27 V; or a serious misdemeanor for a first possession offense,
 17 28 an aggravated misdemeanor for a second possession offense,
 17 29 or a class "D" felony for two or more previous possession
 17 30 offenses. Current law in Code section 124A.4 provides that if
 17 31 a person unlawfully manufactures, delivers, or possesses with
 17 32 intent to deliver an imitation controlled substance, the person
 17 33 commits an aggravated misdemeanor, or if the person delivers
 17 34 to a person under 18 years of age who is at least three years
 17 35 younger than the violator, the person commits a class "D"
 18  1 felony.  In addition, under current law, if a person unlawfully
 18  2 and knowingly publishes an advertisement or distributes in a
 18  3 public place a promotion for an imitation controlled substance
 18  4 the person commits a serious misdemeanor.
 18  5    The bill enhances the criminal penalties for controlled
 18  6 substances classified in Code sections 124.204(4)(ai) and
 18  7 124.204(6)(i) from an aggravated misdemeanor to a class "C"
 18  8 felony punishable pursuant to Code section 124.401(1)(c)(8).
 18  9 This change equalizes the criminal penalties with violations
 18 10 involving other schedule I controlled substances.
 18 11    The bill provides that if the same person commits two or
 18 12 more acts which are in violation of Code section 124.401(1)
 18 13 and the acts occur in the same location or time period so the
 18 14 acts are attributable to a single scheme, the acts may be
 18 15 considered a single violation and the weights of the imitation
 18 16 controlled substance may be combined for purposes of charging
 18 17 the offender.
 18 18    The amendment to Code section 124.401A provides that
 18 19 a person who is 18 years of age or older who unlawfully
 18 20 manufactures with the intent to distribute, distributes,
 18 21 or possesses with the intent to distribute an imitation
 18 22 controlled substance to another person 18 years of age or older
 18 23 within 1,000 feet of the real property comprising a public or
 18 24 nonpublic school, may be sentenced up to an additional term of
 18 25 confinement of five years in addition to any other penalty.
 18 26    The amendment to Code section 124.401B provides that
 18 27 a person who unlawfully possesses an imitation controlled
 18 28 substance within 1,000 feet of the real property comprising a
 18 29 school, public park, public pool, public recreation center, or
 18 30 marked school bus may be sentenced up to 100 hours of community
 18 31 service.
 18 32    The amendments to Code section 124.406 relate to the
 18 33 distribution or possession with the intent to distribute an
 18 34 imitation controlled substance to a person under 18 years of
 18 35 age.  A person who distributes or possesses with the intent to
 19  1 distribute an imitation controlled substance, represented to
 19  2 be a substance listed in schedule I or schedule II, to a person
 19  3 under 18 years of age commits a class "B" felony. The required
 19  4 penalty for such a violation is a minimum term of confinement
 19  5 of 10 years if the substance was distributed within 1,000
 19  6 feet of the real property comprising a public or nonpublic
 19  7 school, public park, public pool, or public recreation center.
 19  8 A person who distributes or possesses with the intent to
 19  9 distribute an imitation controlled substance, represented to be
 19 10 a substance listed in schedule III, to a person under 18 years
 19 11 of age, who is at least three years younger than the violator,
 19 12 commits a class "C" felony.  A person who distributes or
 19 13 possesses with the intent to distribute an imitation controlled
 19 14 substance, represented to be a substance listed in schedule
 19 15 IV or schedule V, to a person under 18 years of age, who is
 19 16 at least three years younger than the violator, commits an
 19 17 aggravated misdemeanor.
 19 18    The amendment to Code section 124.415 requires that a peace
 19 19 officer make a reasonable effort to identify a person under 18
 19 20 years of age discovered to be in possession of an imitation
 19 21 controlled substance, and if the person is not referred to
 19 22 juvenile court, the peace officer shall make a reasonable
 19 23 effort to notify the person's custodial parent of the
 19 24 possession unless the officer has reasonable grounds to believe
 19 25 such notification is not in the best interests of the person.
 19 26 The bill specifies that if the person is taken into custody
 19 27 the juvenile court officer shall make a reasonable effort to
 19 28 identify the school of attendance and to notify the school or
 19 29 nonpublic school of the taking into custody of the person.
 19 30    The bill creates Code section 124.417, which is similar to
 19 31 Code section 124A.5 repealed by the bill.  A person registered
 19 32 under Code section 124.302 does not violate the bill if the
 19 33 person manufactures, delivers, possesses, or possesses with the
 19 34 intent to manufacture or deliver, or acts with others to do
 19 35 such activities, if the person uses the imitation controlled
 20  1 substance for use as a placebo by a registered practitioner in
 20  2 the court of professional practice or research.
 20  3    SCHEDULE I, III, AND IV CONTROLLED SUBSTANCES.  The bill
 20  4 transfers numerous substances classified as "hallucinogenic
 20  5 substances" under schedule I and reclassifies the substances
 20  6 as "other substances" under schedule I.  By transferring the
 20  7 substances to "other substances", a person commits a class "C"
 20  8 felony under Code section 124.401(1)(c)(8) if the violation
 20  9 involves such a substance. Under current law, a person commits
 20 10 an aggravated misdemeanor under Code section 124.401(1)(d) when
 20 11 committing such violations.
 20 12    The bill adds new substances as "hallucinogenic substances"
 20 13 under schedule I.  A person commits a class "C" felony under
 20 14 Code section 124.401(1)(c)(8) if the violation involves the new
 20 15 hallucinogenic substances.
 20 16    The bill adds new substances as "stimulants" under schedule
 20 17 I.  A person commits a class "C" felony under Code section
 20 18 124.401(1)(c)(8) if the violation involves the new stimulant
 20 19 substances.
 20 20    The bill also adds new substances to the classification of
 20 21 "other substances" under schedule I.  A person commits a class
 20 22 "C" felony under Code section 124.401(1)(c)(8) for a violation
 20 23 involving the new substances.
 20 24    The bill strikes one substance classified as a
 20 25 "hallucinogenic substance" under schedule I and reclassifies
 20 26 the substance as a "stimulant" containing a synthetic cathinone
 20 27 under schedule I.  The transfer of the substance within
 20 28 schedule I also changes the criminal penalty for a violation
 20 29 involving the substance from a class "C" felony under Code
 20 30 section 124.401(1)(c)(8) to an aggravated misdemeanor under
 20 31 Code section 124.401(1)(d).  The bill also strikes a substance
 20 32 in Code section 124.204(6)(i)(3) from schedule I and does not
 20 33 reclassify the substance in any other substance schedule.
 20 34    The bill also removes numerous substances from schedule I
 20 35 which are currently classified as "stimulants" in Code section
 21  1 124.204(6)(i).
 21  2    The bill also strikes two narcotic substances from schedule
 21  3 III and adds three substances to schedule IV.  A violation
 21  4 involving a schedule IV controlled substance is punishable as

 16 15    IMITATION CONTROLLED SUBSTANCES.  Under current law
 16 16 imitation controlled substances are regulated under Code
 16 17 chapter 124A.  The bill repeals Code chapter 124A and transfers
 16 18 the regulation of imitation controlled substances to Code
 16 19 chapter 124.  The definition and designation of an imitation
 16 20 controlled substance in Code chapter 124 remains identical
 16 21 to the definition and designation of an imitation controlled
 16 22 substance under current law in Code chapter 124A.

 16 25 but by color, shape, size, markings, and other aspects of

 17 18 than $1 million if the imitation controlled substance is more
 17 19 than 10 kilograms; a class "B" felony punishable by confinement

 15 33 the bill, if a person unlawfully manufactures, delivers, or
 15 34 possesses with the intent to deliver a controlled substance
 15 35 containing cocaine base, or unlawfully acts with, enters into
 16  1 a common scheme or design with, or conspires with one or more
 16  2 persons to manufacture, deliver, or possess such a controlled
 16  3 substance, the person commits the following offenses: a class
 16  4 "B" felony punishable by confinement of no more than 50 years
 16  5 and a fine of not more than $1 million if the controlled
 16  6 substance containing cocaine base is more than 125 grams rather
 16  7 than the current 50 grams; a class "B" felony punishable by
 16  8 confinement of no more than 25 years and a fine of not less than
 16  9 $5,000 but not more than $100,000 if the imitation controlled
 16 10 substance is more than 35 grams but not more than 125 grams
 16 11 rather than the current 10 to 50 grams; or a class "C" felony
 16 12 punishable by a fine of not less than $1,000 but not more than
 16 13 $50,000 if the controlled substance containing cocaine base is
 16 14 35 grams or less rather than the current 10 grams or less.
 16 15    IMITATION CONTROLLED SUBSTANCES.  Under current law
 16 16 imitation controlled substances are regulated under Code
 16 17 chapter 124A.  The bill repeals Code chapter 124A and transfers
 16 18 the regulation of imitation controlled substances to Code
 16 19 chapter 124.  The definition and designation of an imitation
 16 20 controlled substance in Code chapter 124 remains identical
 16 21 to the definition and designation of an imitation controlled
 16 22 substance under current law in Code chapter 124A.
 16 23    Under the bill and in current law, an imitation controlled
 16 24 substance means a substance which is not a controlled substance
 16 25 but by color, shape, size, markings, and other aspects of
 16 26 dosage unit appearance, and packaging or other factors, appears
 16 27 to be or resembles a controlled substance. The board of
 16 28 pharmacy may designate a substance as an imitation controlled
 16 29 substance pursuant to the board's rulemaking authority and in
 16 30 accordance with Code chapter 17A.
 16 31    In addition, under current law and in the bill, if a
 16 32 substance has not been designated as an imitation controlled
 16 33 substance by the board of pharmacy and when dosage unit
 16 34 appearance alone does not establish that a substance is an
 16 35 imitation controlled substance, the following factors may
 17  1 be considered in determining whether the substance is an
 17  2 imitation controlled substance: the substance is represented
 17  3 as having the effect of a controlled substance; the substance
 17  4 is represented as a controlled substance or as a substitute for
 17  5 a controlled substance because of its nature or appearance;
 17  6 or a person receives money or other property having a value
 17  7 substantially greater than the actual value of the substance
 17  8 when sold.
 17  9    Under the bill, if a person unlawfully manufactures,
 17 10 delivers, or possesses with the intent to deliver an imitation
 17 11 controlled substance containing any detectable amount of those
 17 12 substances identified in Code section 124.204(9), or unlawfully
 17 13 acts with, enters into a common scheme or design with, or
 17 14 conspires with one or more persons to manufacture, deliver,
 17 15 or possess such imitation controlled substances, the person
 17 16 commits the following offense: a class "B" felony punishable
 17 17 by confinement of no more than 50 years and a fine of not more
 17 18 than $1 million if the imitation controlled substance is more
 17 19 than 10 kilograms; a class "B" felony punishable by confinement
 17 20 of no more than 25 years and a fine of not less than $5,000 but
 17 21 not more than $100,000 if the imitation controlled substance
 17 22 is more than five kilograms but not more than 10 kilograms; a
 17 23 class "C" felony punishable by a fine of not less than $1,000
 17 24 but not more than $50,000 if the imitation controlled substance
 17 25 is five kilograms or less; or an aggravated misdemeanor if the
 17 26 imitation controlled substance is classified in schedule IV or
 17 27 V; or a serious misdemeanor for a first possession offense,
 17 28 an aggravated misdemeanor for a second possession offense,
 17 29 or a class "D" felony for two or more previous possession
 17 30 offenses. Current law in Code section 124A.4 provides that if
 17 31 a person unlawfully manufactures, delivers, or possesses with
 17 32 intent to deliver an imitation controlled substance, the person
 17 33 commits an aggravated misdemeanor, or if the person delivers
 17 34 to a person under 18 years of age who is at least three years
 17 35 younger than the violator, the person commits a class "D"
 18  1 felony.  In addition, under current law, if a person unlawfully
 18  2 and knowingly publishes an advertisement or distributes in a
 18  3 public place a promotion for an imitation controlled substance
 18  4 the person commits a serious misdemeanor.
 18  5    The bill enhances the criminal penalties for controlled
 18  6 substances classified in Code sections 124.204(4)(ai) and
 18  7 124.204(6)(i) from an aggravated misdemeanor to a class "C"
 18  8 felony punishable pursuant to Code section 124.401(1)(c)(8).
 18  9 This change equalizes the criminal penalties with violations
 18 10 involving other schedule I controlled substances.
 18 11    The bill provides that if the same person commits two or
 18 12 more acts which are in violation of Code section 124.401(1)
 18 13 and the acts occur in the same location or time period so the
 18 14 acts are attributable to a single scheme, the acts may be
 18 15 considered a single violation and the weights of the imitation
 18 16 controlled substance may be combined for purposes of charging
 18 17 the offender.
 18 18    The amendment to Code section 124.401A provides that
 18 19 a person who is 18 years of age or older who unlawfully
 18 20 manufactures with the intent to distribute, distributes,
 18 21 or possesses with the intent to distribute an imitation
 18 22 controlled substance to another person 18 years of age or older
 18 23 within 1,000 feet of the real property comprising a public or
 18 24 nonpublic school, may be sentenced up to an additional term of
 18 25 confinement of five years in addition to any other penalty.
 18 26    The amendment to Code section 124.401B provides that
 18 27 a person who unlawfully possesses an imitation controlled
 18 28 substance within 1,000 feet of the real property comprising a
 18 29 school, public park, public pool, public recreation center, or
 18 30 marked school bus may be sentenced up to 100 hours of community
 18 31 service.
 18 32    The amendments to Code section 124.406 relate to the
 18 33 distribution or possession with the intent to distribute an
 18 34 imitation controlled substance to a person under 18 years of
 18 35 age.  A person who distributes or possesses with the intent to
 19  1 distribute an imitation controlled substance, represented to
 19  2 be a substance listed in schedule I or schedule II, to a person
 19  3 under 18 years of age commits a class "B" felony. The required
 19  4 penalty for such a violation is a minimum term of confinement
 19  5 of 10 years if the substance was distributed within 1,000
 19  6 feet of the real property comprising a public or nonpublic
 19  7 school, public park, public pool, or public recreation center.
 19  8 A person who distributes or possesses with the intent to
 19  9 distribute an imitation controlled substance, represented to be
 19 10 a substance listed in schedule III, to a person under 18 years
 19 11 of age, who is at least three years younger than the violator,
 19 12 commits a class "C" felony.  A person who distributes or
 19 13 possesses with the intent to distribute an imitation controlled
 19 14 substance, represented to be a substance listed in schedule
 19 15 IV or schedule V, to a person under 18 years of age, who is
 19 16 at least three years younger than the violator, commits an
 19 17 aggravated misdemeanor.
 19 18    The amendment to Code section 124.415 requires that a peace
 19 19 officer make a reasonable effort to identify a person under 18
 19 20 years of age discovered to be in possession of an imitation
 19 21 controlled substance, and if the person is not referred to
 19 22 juvenile court, the peace officer shall make a reasonable
 19 23 effort to notify the person's custodial parent of the
 19 24 possession unless the officer has reasonable grounds to believe
 19 25 such notification is not in the best interests of the person.
 19 26 The bill specifies that if the person is taken into custody
 19 27 the juvenile court officer shall make a reasonable effort to
 19 28 identify the school of attendance and to notify the school or
 19 29 nonpublic school of the taking into custody of the person.
 19 30    The bill creates Code section 124.417, which is similar to
 19 31 Code section 124A.5 repealed by the bill.  A person registered
 19 32 under Code section 124.302 does not violate the bill if the
 19 33 person manufactures, delivers, possesses, or possesses with the
 19 34 intent to manufacture or deliver, or acts with others to do
 19 35 such activities, if the person uses the imitation controlled
 20  1 substance for use as a placebo by a registered practitioner in
 20  2 the court of professional practice or research.
 20  3    SCHEDULE I, III, AND IV CONTROLLED SUBSTANCES.  The bill
 20  4 transfers numerous substances classified as "hallucinogenic
 20  5 substances" under schedule I and reclassifies the substances
 20  6 as "other substances" under schedule I.  By transferring the
 20  7 substances to "other substances", a person commits a class "C"
 20  8 felony under Code section 124.401(1)(c)(8) if the violation
 20  9 involves such a substance. Under current law, a person commits
 20 10 an aggravated misdemeanor under Code section 124.401(1)(d) when
 20 11 committing such violations.
 20 12    The bill adds new substances as "hallucinogenic substances"
 20 13 under schedule I.  A person commits a class "C" felony under
 20 14 Code section 124.401(1)(c)(8) if the violation involves the new
 20 15 hallucinogenic substances.
 20 16    The bill adds new substances as "stimulants" under schedule
 20 17 I.  A person commits a class "C" felony under Code section
 20 18 124.401(1)(c)(8) if the violation involves the new stimulant
 20 19 substances.
 20 20    The bill also adds new substances to the classification of
 20 21 "other substances" under schedule I.  A person commits a class
 20 22 "C" felony under Code section 124.401(1)(c)(8) for a violation
 20 23 involving the new substances.
 20 24    The bill strikes one substance classified as a
 20 25 "hallucinogenic substance" under schedule I and reclassifies
 20 26 the substance as a "stimulant" containing a synthetic cathinone
 20 27 under schedule I.  The transfer of the substance within
 20 28 schedule I also changes the criminal penalty for a violation
 20 29 involving the substance from a class "C" felony under Code
 20 30 section 124.401(1)(c)(8) to an aggravated misdemeanor under
 20 31 Code section 124.401(1)(d).  The bill also strikes a substance
 20 32 in Code section 124.204(6)(i)(3) from schedule I and does not
 20 33 reclassify the substance in any other substance schedule.
 20 34    The bill also removes numerous substances from schedule I
 20 35 which are currently classified as "stimulants" in Code section
 21  1 124.204(6)(i).
 21  2    The bill also strikes two narcotic substances from schedule
 21  3 III and adds three substances to schedule IV.  A violation
 21  4 involving a schedule IV controlled substance is punishable as
 21  5 an aggravated misdemeanor in Code section 124.401(1)(d).

 15 30    COCAINE BASE.  The bill increases the amounts of controlled
 15 31 substances containing cocaine base (crack cocaine) that
 15 32 determine the criminal penalty for certain offenses.  Under
 15 33 the bill, if a person unlawfully manufactures, delivers, or
 15 34 possesses with the intent to deliver a controlled substance
 15 35 containing cocaine base, or unlawfully acts with, enters into
 16  1 a common scheme or design with, or conspires with one or more
 16  2 persons to manufacture, deliver, or possess such a controlled
 16  3 substance, the person commits the following offenses: a class
 16  4 "B" felony punishable by confinement of no more than 50 years
 16  5 and a fine of not more than $1 million if the controlled
 16  6 substance containing cocaine base is more than 125 grams rather
 16  7 than the current 50 grams; a class "B" felony punishable by
 16  8 confinement of no more than 25 years and a fine of not less than
 16  9 $5,000 but not more than $100,000 if the imitation controlled
 16 10 substance is more than 35 grams but not more than 125 grams
 16 11 rather than the current 10 to 50 grams; or a class "C" felony
 16 12 punishable by a fine of not less than $1,000 but not more than
 16 13 $50,000 if the controlled substance containing cocaine base is
 16 14 35 grams or less rather than the current 10 grams or less.
 16 15    IMITATION CONTROLLED SUBSTANCES.  Under current law
 16 16 imitation controlled substances are regulated under Code
 16 17 chapter 124A.  The bill repeals Code chapter 124A and transfers
 16 18 the regulation of imitation controlled substances to Code
 16 19 chapter 124.  The definition and designation of an imitation
 16 20 controlled substance in Code chapter 124 remains identical
 16 21 to the definition and designation of an imitation controlled
 16 22 substance under current law in Code chapter 124A.
 16 23    Under the bill and in current law, an imitation controlled
 16 24 substance means a substance which is not a controlled substance
 16 25 but by color, shape, size, markings, and other aspects of
 16 26 dosage unit appearance, and packaging or other factors, appears
 16 27 to be or resembles a controlled substance. The board of
 16 28 pharmacy may designate a substance as an imitation controlled
 16 29 substance pursuant to the board's rulemaking authority and in
 16 30 accordance with Code chapter 17A.
 16 31    In addition, under current law and in the bill, if a
 16 32 substance has not been designated as an imitation controlled
 16 33 substance by the board of pharmacy and when dosage unit
 16 34 appearance alone does not establish that a substance is an
 16 35 imitation controlled substance, the following factors may
 17  1 be considered in determining whether the substance is an
 17  2 imitation controlled substance: the substance is represented
 17  3 as having the effect of a controlled substance; the substance
 17  4 is represented as a controlled substance or as a substitute for
 17  5 a controlled substance because of its nature or appearance;
 17  6 or a person receives money or other property having a value
 17  7 substantially greater than the actual value of the substance
 17  8 when sold.
 17  9    Under the bill, if a person unlawfully manufactures,
 17 10 delivers, or possesses with the intent to deliver an imitation
 17 11 controlled substance containing any detectable amount of those
 17 12 substances identified in Code section 124.204(9), or unlawfully
 17 13 acts with, enters into a common scheme or design with, or
 17 14 conspires with one or more persons to manufacture, deliver,
 17 15 or possess such imitation controlled substances, the person
 17 16 commits the following offense: a class "B" felony punishable
 17 17 by confinement of no more than 50 years and a fine of not more
 17 18 than $1 million if the imitation controlled substance is more
 17 19 than 10 kilograms; a class "B" felony punishable by confinement
 17 20 of no more than 25 years and a fine of not less than $5,000 but
 17 21 not more than $100,000 if the imitation controlled substance
 17 22 is more than five kilograms but not more than 10 kilograms; a
 17 23 class "C" felony punishable by a fine of not less than $1,000
 17 24 but not more than $50,000 if the imitation controlled substance
 17 25 is five kilograms or less; or an aggravated misdemeanor if the
 17 26 imitation controlled substance is classified in schedule IV or
 17 27 V; or a serious misdemeanor for a first possession offense,
 17 28 an aggravated misdemeanor for a second possession offense,
 17 29 or a class "D" felony for two or more previous possession
 17 30 offenses. Current law in Code section 124A.4 provides that if
 17 31 a person unlawfully manufactures, delivers, or possesses with
 17 32 intent to deliver an imitation controlled substance, the person
 17 33 commits an aggravated misdemeanor, or if the person delivers
 17 34 to a person under 18 years of age who is at least three years
 17 35 younger than the violator, the person commits a class "D"
 18  1 felony.  In addition, under current law, if a person unlawfully
 18  2 and knowingly publishes an advertisement or distributes in a
 18  3 public place a promotion for an imitation controlled substance
 18  4 the person commits a serious misdemeanor.
 18  5    The bill enhances the criminal penalties for controlled
 18  6 substances classified in Code sections 124.204(4)(ai) and
 18  7 124.204(6)(i) from an aggravated misdemeanor to a class "C"
 18  8 felony punishable pursuant to Code section 124.401(1)(c)(8).
 18  9 This change equalizes the criminal penalties with violations
 18 10 involving other schedule I controlled substances.
 18 11    The bill provides that if the same person commits two or
 18 12 more acts which are in violation of Code section 124.401(1)
 18 13 and the acts occur in the same location or time period so the
 18 14 acts are attributable to a single scheme, the acts may be
 18 15 considered a single violation and the weights of the imitation
 18 16 controlled substance may be combined for purposes of charging
 18 17 the offender.
 18 18    The amendment to Code section 124.401A provides that
 18 19 a person who is 18 years of age or older who unlawfully
 18 20 manufactures with the intent to distribute, distributes,
 18 21 or possesses with the intent to distribute an imitation
 18 22 controlled substance to another person 18 years of age or older
 18 23 within 1,000 feet of the real property comprising a public or
 18 24 nonpublic school, may be sentenced up to an additional term of
 18 25 confinement of five years in addition to any other penalty.
 18 26    The amendment to Code section 124.401B provides that
 18 27 a person who unlawfully possesses an imitation controlled
 18 28 substance within 1,000 feet of the real property comprising a
 18 29 school, public park, public pool, public recreation center, or
 18 30 marked school bus may be sentenced up to 100 hours of community
 18 31 service.
 18 32    The amendments to Code section 124.406 relate to the
 18 33 distribution or possession with the intent to distribute an
 18 34 imitation controlled substance to a person under 18 years of
 18 35 age.  A person who distributes or possesses with the intent to
 19  1 distribute an imitation controlled substance, represented to
 19  2 be a substance listed in schedule I or schedule II, to a person
 19  3 under 18 years of age commits a class "B" felony. The required
 19  4 penalty for such a violation is a minimum term of confinement
 19  5 of 10 years if the substance was distributed within 1,000
 19  6 feet of the real property comprising a public or nonpublic
 19  7 school, public park, public pool, or public recreation center.
 19  8 A person who distributes or possesses with the intent to
 19  9 distribute an imitation controlled substance, represented to be
 19 10 a substance listed in schedule III, to a person under 18 years
 19 11 of age, who is at least three years younger than the violator,
 19 12 commits a class "C" felony.  A person who distributes or
 19 13 possesses with the intent to distribute an imitation controlled
 19 14 substance, represented to be a substance listed in schedule
 19 15 IV or schedule V, to a person under 18 years of age, who is
 19 16 at least three years younger than the violator, commits an
 19 17 aggravated misdemeanor.
 19 18    The amendment to Code section 124.415 requires that a peace
 19 19 officer make a reasonable effort to identify a person under 18
 19 20 years of age discovered to be in possession of an imitation
 19 21 controlled substance, and if the person is not referred to
 19 22 juvenile court, the peace officer shall make a reasonable
 19 23 effort to notify the person's custodial parent of the
 19 24 possession unless the officer has reasonable grounds to believe
 19 25 such notification is not in the best interests of the person.

 19 27 the juvenile court officer shall make a reasonable effort to
 19 28 identify the school of attendance and to notify the school or
 19 29 nonpublic school of the taking into custody of the person.
 19 30    The bill creates Code section 124.417, which is similar to
 19 31 Code section 124A.5 repealed by the bill.  A person registered
 19 32 under Code section 124.302 does not violate the bill if the
 19 33 person manufactures, delivers, possesses, or possesses with the
 19 34 intent to manufacture or deliver, or acts with others to do
 19 35 such activities, if the person uses the imitation controlled
 20  1 substance for use as a placebo by a registered practitioner in

 20  4 transfers numerous substances classified as "hallucinogenic
 20  5 substances" under schedule I and reclassifies the substances

 20  7 substances to "other substances", a person commits a class "C"
 20  8 felony under Code section 124.401(1)(c)(8) if the violation
 20  9 involves such a substance. Under current law, a person commits
 20 10 an aggravated misdemeanor under Code section 124.401(1)(d) when
 20 11 committing such violations.
 20 12    The bill adds new substances as "hallucinogenic substances"
 20 13 under schedule I.  A person commits a class "C" felony under
 20 14 Code section 124.401(1)(c)(8) if the violation involves the new
 20 15 hallucinogenic substances.
 20 16    The bill adds new substances as "stimulants" under schedule
 20 17 I.  A person commits a class "C" felony under Code section
 20 18 124.401(1)(c)(8) if the violation involves the new stimulant
 20 19 substances.
 20 20    The bill also adds new substances to the classification of
 20 21 "other substances" under schedule I.  A person commits a class
 20 22 "C" felony under Code section 124.401(1)(c)(8) for a violation
 20 23 involving the new substances.
 20 24    The bill strikes one substance classified as a
 20 25 "hallucinogenic substance" under schedule I and reclassifies
 20 26 the substance as a "stimulant" containing a synthetic cathinone
 20 27 under schedule I.  The transfer of the substance within
 20 28 schedule I also changes the criminal penalty for a violation
 20 29 involving the substance from a class "C" felony under Code
 20 30 section 124.401(1)(c)(8) to an aggravated misdemeanor under
 20 31 Code section 124.401(1)(d).  The bill also strikes a substance
 20 32 in Code section 124.204(6)(i)(3) from schedule I and does not
 20 33 reclassify the substance in any other substance schedule.
 20 34    The bill also removes numerous substances from schedule I
 20 35 which are currently classified as "stimulants" in Code section
 21  1 124.204(6)(i).
 21  2    The bill also strikes two narcotic substances from schedule

 16 13 $50,000 if the controlled substance containing cocaine base is
 16 14 35 grams or less rather than the current 10 grams or less.
 16 15    IMITATION CONTROLLED SUBSTANCES.  Under current law
 16 16 imitation controlled substances are regulated under Code
 16 17 chapter 124A.  The bill repeals Code chapter 124A and transfers
 16 18 the regulation of imitation controlled substances to Code
 16 19 chapter 124.  The definition and designation of an imitation
 16 20 controlled substance in Code chapter 124 remains identical
 16 21 to the definition and designation of an imitation controlled
 16 22 substance under current law in Code chapter 124A.
 16 23    Under the bill and in current law, an imitation controlled
 16 24 substance means a substance which is not a controlled substance
 16 25 but by color, shape, size, markings, and other aspects of
 16 26 dosage unit appearance, and packaging or other factors, appears
 16 27 to be or resembles a controlled substance. The board of
 16 28 pharmacy may designate a substance as an imitation controlled
 16 29 substance pursuant to the board's rulemaking authority and in
 16 30 accordance with Code chapter 17A.
 16 31    In addition, under current law and in the bill, if a
 16 32 substance has not been designated as an imitation controlled
 16 33 substance by the board of pharmacy and when dosage unit
 16 34 appearance alone does not establish that a substance is an
 16 35 imitation controlled substance, the following factors may
 17  1 be considered in determining whether the substance is an
 17  2 imitation controlled substance: the substance is represented
 17  3 as having the effect of a controlled substance; the substance
 17  4 is represented as a controlled substance or as a substitute for
 17  5 a controlled substance because of its nature or appearance;
 17  6 or a person receives money or other property having a value
 17  7 substantially greater than the actual value of the substance
 17  8 when sold.
 17  9    Under the bill, if a person unlawfully manufactures,
 17 10 delivers, or possesses with the intent to deliver an imitation
 17 11 controlled substance containing any detectable amount of those
 17 12 substances identified in Code section 124.204(9), or unlawfully
 17 13 acts with, enters into a common scheme or design with, or
 17 14 conspires with one or more persons to manufacture, deliver,
 17 15 or possess such imitation controlled substances, the person
 17 16 commits the following offense: a class "B" felony punishable
 17 17 by confinement of no more than 50 years and a fine of not more
 17 18 than $1 million if the imitation controlled substance is more
 17 19 than 10 kilograms; a class "B" felony punishable by confinement
 17 20 of no more than 25 years and a fine of not less than $5,000 but
 17 21 not more than $100,000 if the imitation controlled substance
 17 22 is more than five kilograms but not more than 10 kilograms; a
 17 23 class "C" felony punishable by a fine of not less than $1,000
 17 24 but not more than $50,000 if the imitation controlled substance
 17 25 is five kilograms or less; or an aggravated misdemeanor if the
 17 26 imitation controlled substance is classified in schedule IV or
 17 27 V; or a serious misdemeanor for a first possession offense,
 17 28 an aggravated misdemeanor for a second possession offense,
 17 29 or a class "D" felony for two or more previous possession
 17 30 offenses. Current law in Code section 124A.4 provides that if
 17 31 a person unlawfully manufactures, delivers, or possesses with
 17 32 intent to deliver an imitation controlled substance, the person
 17 33 commits an aggravated misdemeanor, or if the person delivers
 17 34 to a person under 18 years of age who is at least three years
 17 35 younger than the violator, the person commits a class "D"
 18  1 felony.  In addition, under current law, if a person unlawfully
 18  2 and knowingly publishes an advertisement or distributes in a
 18  3 public place a promotion for an imitation controlled substance
 18  4 the person commits a serious misdemeanor.
 18  5    The bill enhances the criminal penalties for controlled
 18  6 substances classified in Code sections 124.204(4)(ai) and
 18  7 124.204(6)(i) from an aggravated misdemeanor to a class "C"
 18  8 felony punishable pursuant to Code section 124.401(1)(c)(8).
 18  9 This change equalizes the criminal penalties with violations
 18 10 involving other schedule I controlled substances.
 18 11    The bill provides that if the same person commits two or
 18 12 more acts which are in violation of Code section 124.401(1)
 18 13 and the acts occur in the same location or time period so the
 18 14 acts are attributable to a single scheme, the acts may be
 18 15 considered a single violation and the weights of the imitation
 18 16 controlled substance may be combined for purposes of charging
 18 17 the offender.
 18 18    The amendment to Code section 124.401A provides that
 18 19 a person who is 18 years of age or older who unlawfully
 18 20 manufactures with the intent to distribute, distributes,
 18 21 or possesses with the intent to distribute an imitation
 18 22 controlled substance to another person 18 years of age or older
 18 23 within 1,000 feet of the real property comprising a public or
 18 24 nonpublic school, may be sentenced up to an additional term of
 18 25 confinement of five years in addition to any other penalty.
 18 26    The amendment to Code section 124.401B provides that
 18 27 a person who unlawfully possesses an imitation controlled
 18 28 substance within 1,000 feet of the real property comprising a
 18 29 school, public park, public pool, public recreation center, or
 18 30 marked school bus may be sentenced up to 100 hours of community
 18 31 service.
 18 32    The amendments to Code section 124.406 relate to the
 18 33 distribution or possession with the intent to distribute an
 18 34 imitation controlled substance to a person under 18 years of
 18 35 age.  A person who distributes or possesses with the intent to
 19  1 distribute an imitation controlled substance, represented to
 19  2 be a substance listed in schedule I or schedule II, to a person
 19  3 under 18 years of age commits a class "B" felony. The required
 19  4 penalty for such a violation is a minimum term of confinement
 19  5 of 10 years if the substance was distributed within 1,000
 19  6 feet of the real property comprising a public or nonpublic
 19  7 school, public park, public pool, or public recreation center.
 19  8 A person who distributes or possesses with the intent to
 19  9 distribute an imitation controlled substance, represented to be
 19 10 a substance listed in schedule III, to a person under 18 years
 19 11 of age, who is at least three years younger than the violator,
 19 12 commits a class "C" felony.  A person who distributes or
 19 13 possesses with the intent to distribute an imitation controlled
 19 14 substance, represented to be a substance listed in schedule
 19 15 IV or schedule V, to a person under 18 years of age, who is
 19 16 at least three years younger than the violator, commits an
 19 17 aggravated misdemeanor.
 19 18    The amendment to Code section 124.415 requires that a peace
 19 19 officer make a reasonable effort to identify a person under 18
 19 20 years of age discovered to be in possession of an imitation
 19 21 controlled substance, and if the person is not referred to
 19 22 juvenile court, the peace officer shall make a reasonable
 19 23 effort to notify the person's custodial parent of the
 19 24 possession unless the officer has reasonable grounds to believe
 19 25 such notification is not in the best interests of the person.
 19 26 The bill specifies that if the person is taken into custody
 19 27 the juvenile court officer shall make a reasonable effort to
 19 28 identify the school of attendance and to notify the school or
 19 29 nonpublic school of the taking into custody of the person.
 19 30    The bill creates Code section 124.417, which is similar to
 19 31 Code section 124A.5 repealed by the bill.  A person registered
 19 32 under Code section 124.302 does not violate the bill if the
 19 33 person manufactures, delivers, possesses, or possesses with the
 19 34 intent to manufacture or deliver, or acts with others to do
 19 35 such activities, if the person uses the imitation controlled
 20  1 substance for use as a placebo by a registered practitioner in
 20  2 the court of professional practice or research.
 20  3    SCHEDULE I, III, AND IV CONTROLLED SUBSTANCES.  The bill
 20  4 transfers numerous substances classified as "hallucinogenic
 20  5 substances" under schedule I and reclassifies the substances
 20  6 as "other substances" under schedule I.  By transferring the
 20  7 substances to "other substances", a person commits a class "C"
 20  8 felony under Code section 124.401(1)(c)(8) if the violation
 20  9 involves such a substance. Under current law, a person commits
 20 10 an aggravated misdemeanor under Code section 124.401(1)(d) when
 20 11 committing such violations.
 20 12    The bill adds new substances as "hallucinogenic substances"
 20 13 under schedule I.  A person commits a class "C" felony under
 20 14 Code section 124.401(1)(c)(8) if the violation involves the new
 20 15 hallucinogenic substances.
 20 16    The bill adds new substances as "stimulants" under schedule
 20 17 I.  A person commits a class "C" felony under Code section
 20 18 124.401(1)(c)(8) if the violation involves the new stimulant
 20 19 substances.
 20 20    The bill also adds new substances to the classification of
 20 21 "other substances" under schedule I.  A person commits a class
 20 22 "C" felony under Code section 124.401(1)(c)(8) for a violation
 20 23 involving the new substances.
 20 24    The bill strikes one substance classified as a
 20 25 "hallucinogenic substance" under schedule I and reclassifies
 20 26 the substance as a "stimulant" containing a synthetic cathinone
 20 27 under schedule I.  The transfer of the substance within
 20 28 schedule I also changes the criminal penalty for a violation
 20 29 involving the substance from a class "C" felony under Code
 20 30 section 124.401(1)(c)(8) to an aggravated misdemeanor under
 20 31 Code section 124.401(1)(d).  The bill also strikes a substance
 20 32 in Code section 124.204(6)(i)(3) from schedule I and does not
 20 33 reclassify the substance in any other substance schedule.
 20 34    The bill also removes numerous substances from schedule I
 20 35 which are currently classified as "stimulants" in Code section
 21  1 124.204(6)(i).
 21  2    The bill also strikes two narcotic substances from schedule
 21  3 III and adds three substances to schedule IV.  A violation
 21  4 involving a schedule IV controlled substance is punishable as
 21  5 an aggravated misdemeanor in Code section 124.401(1)(d).

 15 31 substances containing cocaine base (crack cocaine) that
 15 32 determine the criminal penalty for certain offenses.  Under
 15 33 the bill, if a person unlawfully manufactures, delivers, or
 15 34 possesses with the intent to deliver a controlled substance
 15 35 containing cocaine base, or unlawfully acts with, enters into
 16  1 a common scheme or design with, or conspires with one or more
 16  2 persons to manufacture, deliver, or possess such a controlled
 16  3 substance, the person commits the following offenses: a class
 16  4 "B" felony punishable by confinement of no more than 50 years
 16  5 and a fine of not more than $1 million if the controlled
 16  6 substance containing cocaine base is more than 125 grams rather
 16  7 than the current 50 grams; a class "B" felony punishable by
 16  8 confinement of no more than 25 years and a fine of not less than
 16  9 $5,000 but not more than $100,000 if the imitation controlled
 16 10 substance is more than 35 grams but not more than 125 grams
 16 11 rather than the current 10 to 50 grams; or a class "C" felony
 16 12 punishable by a fine of not less than $1,000 but not more than
 16 13 $50,000 if the controlled substance containing cocaine base is
 16 14 35 grams or less rather than the current 10 grams or less.
 16 15    IMITATION CONTROLLED SUBSTANCES.  Under current law
 16 16 imitation controlled substances are regulated under Code
 16 17 chapter 124A.  The bill repeals Code chapter 124A and transfers
 16 18 the regulation of imitation controlled substances to Code
 16 19 chapter 124.  The definition and designation of an imitation
 16 20 controlled substance in Code chapter 124 remains identical
 16 21 to the definition and designation of an imitation controlled
 16 22 substance under current law in Code chapter 124A.
 16 23    Under the bill and in current law, an imitation controlled
 16 24 substance means a substance which is not a controlled substance
 16 25 but by color, shape, size, markings, and other aspects of
 16 26 dosage unit appearance, and packaging or other factors, appears
 16 27 to be or resembles a controlled substance. The board of
 16 28 pharmacy may designate a substance as an imitation controlled
 16 29 substance pursuant to the board's rulemaking authority and in
 16 30 accordance with Code chapter 17A.
 16 31    In addition, under current law and in the bill, if a
 16 32 substance has not been designated as an imitation controlled
 16 33 substance by the board of pharmacy and when dosage unit
 16 34 appearance alone does not establish that a substance is an
 16 35 imitation controlled substance, the following factors may
 17  1 be considered in determining whether the substance is an
 17  2 imitation controlled substance: the substance is represented
 17  3 as having the effect of a controlled substance; the substance
 17  4 is represented as a controlled substance or as a substitute for
 17  5 a controlled substance because of its nature or appearance;
 17  6 or a person receives money or other property having a value
 17  7 substantially greater than the actual value of the substance
 17  8 when sold.
 17  9    Under the bill, if a person unlawfully manufactures,
 17 10 delivers, or possesses with the intent to deliver an imitation
 17 11 controlled substance containing any detectable amount of those
 17 12 substances identified in Code section 124.204(9), or unlawfully
 17 13 acts with, enters into a common scheme or design with, or
 17 14 conspires with one or more persons to manufacture, deliver,
 17 15 or possess such imitation controlled substances, the person
 17 16 commits the following offense: a class "B" felony punishable
 17 17 by confinement of no more than 50 years and a fine of not more
 17 18 than $1 million if the imitation controlled substance is more
 17 19 than 10 kilograms; a class "B" felony punishable by confinement
 17 20 of no more than 25 years and a fine of not less than $5,000 but
 17 21 not more than $100,000 if the imitation controlled substance
 17 22 is more than five kilograms but not more than 10 kilograms; a
 17 23 class "C" felony punishable by a fine of not less than $1,000
 17 24 but not more than $50,000 if the imitation controlled substance
 17 25 is five kilograms or less; or an aggravated misdemeanor if the
 17 26 imitation controlled substance is classified in schedule IV or
 17 27 V; or a serious misdemeanor for a first possession offense,
 17 28 an aggravated misdemeanor for a second possession offense,
 17 29 or a class "D" felony for two or more previous possession
 17 30 offenses. Current law in Code section 124A.4 provides that if
 17 31 a person unlawfully manufactures, delivers, or possesses with
 17 32 intent to deliver an imitation controlled substance, the person
 17 33 commits an aggravated misdemeanor, or if the person delivers
 17 34 to a person under 18 years of age who is at least three years
 17 35 younger than the violator, the person commits a class "D"
 18  1 felony.  In addition, under current law, if a person unlawfully
 18  2 and knowingly publishes an advertisement or distributes in a
 18  3 public place a promotion for an imitation controlled substance
 18  4 the person commits a serious misdemeanor.
 18  5    The bill enhances the criminal penalties for controlled
 18  6 substances classified in Code sections 124.204(4)(ai) and
 18  7 124.204(6)(i) from an aggravated misdemeanor to a class "C"
 18  8 felony punishable pursuant to Code section 124.401(1)(c)(8).
 18  9 This change equalizes the criminal penalties with violations
 18 10 involving other schedule I controlled substances.
 18 11    The bill provides that if the same person commits two or
 18 12 more acts which are in violation of Code section 124.401(1)
 18 13 and the acts occur in the same location or time period so the
 18 14 acts are attributable to a single scheme, the acts may be
 18 15 considered a single violation and the weights of the imitation
 18 16 controlled substance may be combined for purposes of charging
 18 17 the offender.
 18 18    The amendment to Code section 124.401A provides that

 18 25 confinement of five years in addition to any other penalty.
 18 26    The amendment to Code section 124.401B provides that
 18 27 a person who unlawfully possesses an imitation controlled
 18 28 substance within 1,000 feet of the real property comprising a
 18 29 school, public park, public pool, public recreation center, or
 18 30 marked school bus may be sentenced up to 100 hours of community
 18 31 service.
 18 32    The amendments to Code section 124.406 relate to the
 18 33 distribution or possession with the intent to distribute an
 18 34 imitation controlled substance to a person under 18 years of
 18 35 age.  A person who distributes or possesses with the intent to
 19  1 distribute an imitation controlled substance, represented to
 19  2 be a substance listed in schedule I or schedule II, to a person
 19  3 under 18 years of age commits a class "B" felony. The required
 19  4 penalty for such a violation is a minimum term of confinement
 19  5 of 10 years if the substance was distributed within 1,000
 19  6 feet of the real property comprising a public or nonpublic
 19  7 school, public park, public pool, or public recreation center.
 19  8 A person who distributes or possesses with the intent to

 19 10 a substance listed in schedule III, to a person under 18 years
 19 11 of age, who is at least three years younger than the violator,

 19 14 substance, represented to be a substance listed in schedule
 19 15 IV or schedule V, to a person under 18 years of age, who is
 19 16 at least three years younger than the violator, commits an
 19 17 aggravated misdemeanor.
 19 18    The amendment to Code section 124.415 requires that a peace
 19 19 officer make a reasonable effort to identify a person under 18
 19 20 years of age discovered to be in possession of an imitation
 19 21 controlled substance, and if the person is not referred to
 19 22 juvenile court, the peace officer shall make a reasonable
 19 23 effort to notify the person's custodial parent of the

 19 27 the juvenile court officer shall make a reasonable effort to
 19 28 identify the school of attendance and to notify the school or
 19 29 nonpublic school of the taking into custody of the person.
 19 30    The bill creates Code section 124.417, which is similar to
 19 31 Code section 124A.5 repealed by the bill.  A person registered
 19 32 under Code section 124.302 does not violate the bill if the
 19 33 person manufactures, delivers, possesses, or possesses with the
 19 34 intent to manufacture or deliver, or acts with others to do
 19 35 such activities, if the person uses the imitation controlled
 20  1 substance for use as a placebo by a registered practitioner in
 20  2 the court of professional practice or research.

 20  4 transfers numerous substances classified as "hallucinogenic
 20  5 substances" under schedule I and reclassifies the substances
 20  6 as "other substances" under schedule I.  By transferring the
 20  7 substances to "other substances", a person commits a class "C"
 20  8 felony under Code section 124.401(1)(c)(8) if the violation
 20  9 involves such a substance. Under current law, a person commits
 20 10 an aggravated misdemeanor under Code section 124.401(1)(d) when
 20 11 committing such violations.
 20 12    The bill adds new substances as "hallucinogenic substances"
 20 13 under schedule I.  A person commits a class "C" felony under
 20 14 Code section 124.401(1)(c)(8) if the violation involves the new
 20 15 hallucinogenic substances.
 20 16    The bill adds new substances as "stimulants" under schedule
 20 17 I.  A person commits a class "C" felony under Code section
 20 18 124.401(1)(c)(8) if the violation involves the new stimulant
 20 19 substances.
 20 20    The bill also adds new substances to the classification of
 20 21 "other substances" under schedule I.  A person commits a class
 20 22 "C" felony under Code section 124.401(1)(c)(8) for a violation
 20 23 involving the new substances.
 20 24    The bill strikes one substance classified as a
 20 25 "hallucinogenic substance" under schedule I and reclassifies
 20 26 the substance as a "stimulant" containing a synthetic cathinone

 20 28 schedule I also changes the criminal penalty for a violation
 20 29 involving the substance from a class "C" felony under Code
 20 30 section 124.401(1)(c)(8) to an aggravated misdemeanor under
 20 31 Code section 124.401(1)(d).  The bill also strikes a substance
 20 32 in Code section 124.204(6)(i)(3) from schedule I and does not
 20 33 reclassify the substance in any other substance schedule.
 20 34    The bill also removes numerous substances from schedule I

 16 30 accordance with Code chapter 17A.
 16 31    In addition, under current law and in the bill, if a
 16 32 substance has not been designated as an imitation controlled
 16 33 substance by the board of pharmacy and when dosage unit
 16 34 appearance alone does not establish that a substance is an
 16 35 imitation controlled substance, the following factors may
 17  1 be considered in determining whether the substance is an
 17  2 imitation controlled substance: the substance is represented
 17  3 as having the effect of a controlled substance; the substance
 17  4 is represented as a controlled substance or as a substitute for
 17  5 a controlled substance because of its nature or appearance;
 17  6 or a person receives money or other property having a value
 17  7 substantially greater than the actual value of the substance
 17  8 when sold.
 17  9    Under the bill, if a person unlawfully manufactures,
 17 10 delivers, or possesses with the intent to deliver an imitation
 17 11 controlled substance containing any detectable amount of those
 17 12 substances identified in Code section 124.204(9), or unlawfully
 17 13 acts with, enters into a common scheme or design with, or
 17 14 conspires with one or more persons to manufacture, deliver,
 17 15 or possess such imitation controlled substances, the person
 17 16 commits the following offense: a class "B" felony punishable
 17 17 by confinement of no more than 50 years and a fine of not more
 17 18 than $1 million if the imitation controlled substance is more
 17 19 than 10 kilograms; a class "B" felony punishable by confinement
 17 20 of no more than 25 years and a fine of not less than $5,000 but
 17 21 not more than $100,000 if the imitation controlled substance
 17 22 is more than five kilograms but not more than 10 kilograms; a
 17 23 class "C" felony punishable by a fine of not less than $1,000
 17 24 but not more than $50,000 if the imitation controlled substance
 17 25 is five kilograms or less; or an aggravated misdemeanor if the
 17 26 imitation controlled substance is classified in schedule IV or
 17 27 V; or a serious misdemeanor for a first possession offense,
 17 28 an aggravated misdemeanor for a second possession offense,
 17 29 or a class "D" felony for two or more previous possession
 17 30 offenses. Current law in Code section 124A.4 provides that if
 17 31 a person unlawfully manufactures, delivers, or possesses with
 17 32 intent to deliver an imitation controlled substance, the person
 17 33 commits an aggravated misdemeanor, or if the person delivers
 17 34 to a person under 18 years of age who is at least three years
 17 35 younger than the violator, the person commits a class "D"
 18  1 felony.  In addition, under current law, if a person unlawfully
 18  2 and knowingly publishes an advertisement or distributes in a
 18  3 public place a promotion for an imitation controlled substance
 18  4 the person commits a serious misdemeanor.
 18  5    The bill enhances the criminal penalties for controlled
 18  6 substances classified in Code sections 124.204(4)(ai) and
 18  7 124.204(6)(i) from an aggravated misdemeanor to a class "C"
 18  8 felony punishable pursuant to Code section 124.401(1)(c)(8).
 18  9 This change equalizes the criminal penalties with violations
 18 10 involving other schedule I controlled substances.
 18 11    The bill provides that if the same person commits two or
 18 12 more acts which are in violation of Code section 124.401(1)
 18 13 and the acts occur in the same location or time period so the
 18 14 acts are attributable to a single scheme, the acts may be
 18 15 considered a single violation and the weights of the imitation
 18 16 controlled substance may be combined for purposes of charging
 18 17 the offender.
 18 18    The amendment to Code section 124.401A provides that
 18 19 a person who is 18 years of age or older who unlawfully
 18 20 manufactures with the intent to distribute, distributes,
 18 21 or possesses with the intent to distribute an imitation
 18 22 controlled substance to another person 18 years of age or older
 18 23 within 1,000 feet of the real property comprising a public or
 18 24 nonpublic school, may be sentenced up to an additional term of
 18 25 confinement of five years in addition to any other penalty.
 18 26    The amendment to Code section 124.401B provides that
 18 27 a person who unlawfully possesses an imitation controlled
 18 28 substance within 1,000 feet of the real property comprising a
 18 29 school, public park, public pool, public recreation center, or
 18 30 marked school bus may be sentenced up to 100 hours of community
 18 31 service.
 18 32    The amendments to Code section 124.406 relate to the
 18 33 distribution or possession with the intent to distribute an
 18 34 imitation controlled substance to a person under 18 years of
 18 35 age.  A person who distributes or possesses with the intent to
 19  1 distribute an imitation controlled substance, represented to
 19  2 be a substance listed in schedule I or schedule II, to a person
 19  3 under 18 years of age commits a class "B" felony. The required
 19  4 penalty for such a violation is a minimum term of confinement
 19  5 of 10 years if the substance was distributed within 1,000
 19  6 feet of the real property comprising a public or nonpublic
 19  7 school, public park, public pool, or public recreation center.
 19  8 A person who distributes or possesses with the intent to
 19  9 distribute an imitation controlled substance, represented to be
 19 10 a substance listed in schedule III, to a person under 18 years
 19 11 of age, who is at least three years younger than the violator,
 19 12 commits a class "C" felony.  A person who distributes or
 19 13 possesses with the intent to distribute an imitation controlled
 19 14 substance, represented to be a substance listed in schedule
 19 15 IV or schedule V, to a person under 18 years of age, who is
 19 16 at least three years younger than the violator, commits an
 19 17 aggravated misdemeanor.
 19 18    The amendment to Code section 124.415 requires that a peace
 19 19 officer make a reasonable effort to identify a person under 18
 19 20 years of age discovered to be in possession of an imitation
 19 21 controlled substance, and if the person is not referred to
 19 22 juvenile court, the peace officer shall make a reasonable
 19 23 effort to notify the person's custodial parent of the
 19 24 possession unless the officer has reasonable grounds to believe
 19 25 such notification is not in the best interests of the person.
 19 26 The bill specifies that if the person is taken into custody
 19 27 the juvenile court officer shall make a reasonable effort to
 19 28 identify the school of attendance and to notify the school or
 19 29 nonpublic school of the taking into custody of the person.
 19 30    The bill creates Code section 124.417, which is similar to
 19 31 Code section 124A.5 repealed by the bill.  A person registered
 19 32 under Code section 124.302 does not violate the bill if the
 19 33 person manufactures, delivers, possesses, or possesses with the
 19 34 intent to manufacture or deliver, or acts with others to do
 19 35 such activities, if the person uses the imitation controlled
 20  1 substance for use as a placebo by a registered practitioner in
 20  2 the court of professional practice or research.
 20  3    SCHEDULE I, III, AND IV CONTROLLED SUBSTANCES.  The bill
 20  4 transfers numerous substances classified as "hallucinogenic
 20  5 substances" under schedule I and reclassifies the substances
 20  6 as "other substances" under schedule I.  By transferring the
 20  7 substances to "other substances", a person commits a class "C"
 20  8 felony under Code section 124.401(1)(c)(8) if the violation
 20  9 involves such a substance. Under current law, a person commits
 20 10 an aggravated misdemeanor under Code section 124.401(1)(d) when
 20 11 committing such violations.
 20 12    The bill adds new substances as "hallucinogenic substances"
 20 13 under schedule I.  A person commits a class "C" felony under
 20 14 Code section 124.401(1)(c)(8) if the violation involves the new
 20 15 hallucinogenic substances.
 20 16    The bill adds new substances as "stimulants" under schedule
 20 17 I.  A person commits a class "C" felony under Code section
 20 18 124.401(1)(c)(8) if the violation involves the new stimulant
 20 19 substances.
 20 20    The bill also adds new substances to the classification of
 20 21 "other substances" under schedule I.  A person commits a class
 20 22 "C" felony under Code section 124.401(1)(c)(8) for a violation
 20 23 involving the new substances.
 20 24    The bill strikes one substance classified as a
 20 25 "hallucinogenic substance" under schedule I and reclassifies
 20 26 the substance as a "stimulant" containing a synthetic cathinone
 20 27 under schedule I.  The transfer of the substance within
 20 28 schedule I also changes the criminal penalty for a violation
 20 29 involving the substance from a class "C" felony under Code
 20 30 section 124.401(1)(c)(8) to an aggravated misdemeanor under
 20 31 Code section 124.401(1)(d).  The bill also strikes a substance
 20 32 in Code section 124.204(6)(i)(3) from schedule I and does not
 20 33 reclassify the substance in any other substance schedule.
 20 34    The bill also removes numerous substances from schedule I
 20 35 which are currently classified as "stimulants" in Code section
 21  1 124.204(6)(i).
 21  2    The bill also strikes two narcotic substances from schedule
 21  3 III and adds three substances to schedule IV.  A violation
 21  4 involving a schedule IV controlled substance is punishable as
 21  5 an aggravated misdemeanor in Code section 124.401(1)(d).

 15 33 the bill, if a person unlawfully manufactures, delivers, or
 15 34 possesses with the intent to deliver a controlled substance
 15 35 containing cocaine base, or unlawfully acts with, enters into
 16  1 a common scheme or design with, or conspires with one or more
 16  2 persons to manufacture, deliver, or possess such a controlled
 16  3 substance, the person commits the following offenses: a class
 16  4 "B" felony punishable by confinement of no more than 50 years
 16  5 and a fine of not more than $1 million if the controlled
 16  6 substance containing cocaine base is more than 125 grams rather
 16  7 than the current 50 grams; a class "B" felony punishable by
 16  8 confinement of no more than 25 years and a fine of not less than
 16  9 $5,000 but not more than $100,000 if the imitation controlled
 16 10 substance is more than 35 grams but not more than 125 grams
 16 11 rather than the current 10 to 50 grams; or a class "C" felony
 16 12 punishable by a fine of not less than $1,000 but not more than
 16 13 $50,000 if the controlled substance containing cocaine base is
 16 14 35 grams or less rather than the current 10 grams or less.
 16 15    IMITATION CONTROLLED SUBSTANCES.  Under current law
 16 16 imitation controlled substances are regulated under Code
 16 17 chapter 124A.  The bill repeals Code chapter 124A and transfers
 16 18 the regulation of imitation controlled substances to Code
 16 19 chapter 124.  The definition and designation of an imitation
 16 20 controlled substance in Code chapter 124 remains identical
 16 21 to the definition and designation of an imitation controlled
 16 22 substance under current law in Code chapter 124A.
 16 23    Under the bill and in current law, an imitation controlled
 16 24 substance means a substance which is not a controlled substance
 16 25 but by color, shape, size, markings, and other aspects of
 16 26 dosage unit appearance, and packaging or other factors, appears
 16 27 to be or resembles a controlled substance. The board of
 16 28 pharmacy may designate a substance as an imitation controlled
 16 29 substance pursuant to the board's rulemaking authority and in
 16 30 accordance with Code chapter 17A.
 16 31    In addition, under current law and in the bill, if a
 16 32 substance has not been designated as an imitation controlled
 16 33 substance by the board of pharmacy and when dosage unit
 16 34 appearance alone does not establish that a substance is an
 16 35 imitation controlled substance, the following factors may
 17  1 be considered in determining whether the substance is an
 17  2 imitation controlled substance: the substance is represented
 17  3 as having the effect of a controlled substance; the substance
 17  4 is represented as a controlled substance or as a substitute for
 17  5 a controlled substance because of its nature or appearance;
 17  6 or a person receives money or other property having a value
 17  7 substantially greater than the actual value of the substance
 17  8 when sold.
 17  9    Under the bill, if a person unlawfully manufactures,
 17 10 delivers, or possesses with the intent to deliver an imitation
 17 11 controlled substance containing any detectable amount of those
 17 12 substances identified in Code section 124.204(9), or unlawfully
 17 13 acts with, enters into a common scheme or design with, or
 17 14 conspires with one or more persons to manufacture, deliver,
 17 15 or possess such imitation controlled substances, the person
 17 16 commits the following offense: a class "B" felony punishable
 17 17 by confinement of no more than 50 years and a fine of not more
 17 18 than $1 million if the imitation controlled substance is more
 17 19 than 10 kilograms; a class "B" felony punishable by confinement
 17 20 of no more than 25 years and a fine of not less than $5,000 but
 17 21 not more than $100,000 if the imitation controlled substance
 17 22 is more than five kilograms but not more than 10 kilograms; a
 17 23 class "C" felony punishable by a fine of not less than $1,000
 17 24 but not more than $50,000 if the imitation controlled substance
 17 25 is five kilograms or less; or an aggravated misdemeanor if the
 17 26 imitation controlled substance is classified in schedule IV or
 17 27 V; or a serious misdemeanor for a first possession offense,
 17 28 an aggravated misdemeanor for a second possession offense,
 17 29 or a class "D" felony for two or more previous possession
 17 30 offenses. Current law in Code section 124A.4 provides that if
 17 31 a person unlawfully manufactures, delivers, or possesses with
 17 32 intent to deliver an imitation controlled substance, the person
 17 33 commits an aggravated misdemeanor, or if the person delivers
 17 34 to a person under 18 years of age who is at least three years
 17 35 younger than the violator, the person commits a class "D"
 18  1 felony.  In addition, under current law, if a person unlawfully
 18  2 and knowingly publishes an advertisement or distributes in a
 18  3 public place a promotion for an imitation controlled substance
 18  4 the person commits a serious misdemeanor.
 18  5    The bill enhances the criminal penalties for controlled
 18  6 substances classified in Code sections 124.204(4)(ai) and
 18  7 124.204(6)(i) from an aggravated misdemeanor to a class "C"
 18  8 felony punishable pursuant to Code section 124.401(1)(c)(8).
 18  9 This change equalizes the criminal penalties with violations
 18 10 involving other schedule I controlled substances.
 18 11    The bill provides that if the same person commits two or
 18 12 more acts which are in violation of Code section 124.401(1)
 18 13 and the acts occur in the same location or time period so the
 18 14 acts are attributable to a single scheme, the acts may be
 18 15 considered a single violation and the weights of the imitation
 18 16 controlled substance may be combined for purposes of charging
 18 17 the offender.
 18 18    The amendment to Code section 124.401A provides that
 18 19 a person who is 18 years of age or older who unlawfully

 18 22 controlled substance to another person 18 years of age or older
 18 23 within 1,000 feet of the real property comprising a public or
 18 24 nonpublic school, may be sentenced up to an additional term of
 18 25 confinement of five years in addition to any other penalty.
 18 26    The amendment to Code section 124.401B provides that
 18 27 a person who unlawfully possesses an imitation controlled
 18 28 substance within 1,000 feet of the real property comprising a
 18 29 school, public park, public pool, public recreation center, or
 18 30 marked school bus may be sentenced up to 100 hours of community
 18 31 service.
 18 32    The amendments to Code section 124.406 relate to the
 18 33 distribution or possession with the intent to distribute an
 18 34 imitation controlled substance to a person under 18 years of
 18 35 age.  A person who distributes or possesses with the intent to
 19  1 distribute an imitation controlled substance, represented to
 19  2 be a substance listed in schedule I or schedule II, to a person
 19  3 under 18 years of age commits a class "B" felony. The required
 19  4 penalty for such a violation is a minimum term of confinement
 19  5 of 10 years if the substance was distributed within 1,000
 19  6 feet of the real property comprising a public or nonpublic
 19  7 school, public park, public pool, or public recreation center.
 19  8 A person who distributes or possesses with the intent to

 19 10 a substance listed in schedule III, to a person under 18 years
 19 11 of age, who is at least three years younger than the violator,
 19 12 commits a class "C" felony.  A person who distributes or
 19 13 possesses with the intent to distribute an imitation controlled
 19 14 substance, represented to be a substance listed in schedule
 19 15 IV or schedule V, to a person under 18 years of age, who is
 19 16 at least three years younger than the violator, commits an
 19 17 aggravated misdemeanor.
 19 18    The amendment to Code section 124.415 requires that a peace
 19 19 officer make a reasonable effort to identify a person under 18
 19 20 years of age discovered to be in possession of an imitation
 19 21 controlled substance, and if the person is not referred to
 19 22 juvenile court, the peace officer shall make a reasonable
 19 23 effort to notify the person's custodial parent of the
 19 24 possession unless the officer has reasonable grounds to believe
 19 25 such notification is not in the best interests of the person.

 19 27 the juvenile court officer shall make a reasonable effort to
 19 28 identify the school of attendance and to notify the school or
 19 29 nonpublic school of the taking into custody of the person.
 19 30    The bill creates Code section 124.417, which is similar to
 19 31 Code section 124A.5 repealed by the bill.  A person registered
 19 32 under Code section 124.302 does not violate the bill if the
 19 33 person manufactures, delivers, possesses, or possesses with the
 19 34 intent to manufacture or deliver, or acts with others to do
 19 35 such activities, if the person uses the imitation controlled
 20  1 substance for use as a placebo by a registered practitioner in

 20  4 transfers numerous substances classified as "hallucinogenic
 20  5 substances" under schedule I and reclassifies the substances

 20  7 substances to "other substances", a person commits a class "C"
 20  8 felony under Code section 124.401(1)(c)(8) if the violation
 20  9 involves such a substance. Under current law, a person commits
 20 10 an aggravated misdemeanor under Code section 124.401(1)(d) when
 20 11 committing such violations.
 20 12    The bill adds new substances as "hallucinogenic substances"
 20 13 under schedule I.  A person commits a class "C" felony under
 20 14 Code section 124.401(1)(c)(8) if the violation involves the new
 20 15 hallucinogenic substances.
 20 16    The bill adds new substances as "stimulants" under schedule
 20 17 I.  A person commits a class "C" felony under Code section
 20 18 124.401(1)(c)(8) if the violation involves the new stimulant
 20 19 substances.
 20 20    The bill also adds new substances to the classification of
 20 21 "other substances" under schedule I.  A person commits a class
 20 22 "C" felony under Code section 124.401(1)(c)(8) for a violation
 20 23 involving the new substances.
 20 24    The bill strikes one substance classified as a
 20 25 "hallucinogenic substance" under schedule I and reclassifies
 20 26 the substance as a "stimulant" containing a synthetic cathinone
 20 27 under schedule I.  The transfer of the substance within
 20 28 schedule I also changes the criminal penalty for a violation
 20 29 involving the substance from a class "C" felony under Code
 20 30 section 124.401(1)(c)(8) to an aggravated misdemeanor under
 20 31 Code section 124.401(1)(d).  The bill also strikes a substance
 20 32 in Code section 124.204(6)(i)(3) from schedule I and does not
 20 33 reclassify the substance in any other substance schedule.
 20 34    The bill also removes numerous substances from schedule I
 20 35 which are currently classified as "stimulants" in Code section
 21  1 124.204(6)(i).
 21  2    The bill also strikes two narcotic substances from schedule

 16 15    IMITATION CONTROLLED SUBSTANCES.  Under current law
 16 16 imitation controlled substances are regulated under Code

 16 28 pharmacy may designate a substance as an imitation controlled
 16 29 substance pursuant to the board's rulemaking authority and in

 16 31    In addition, under current law and in the bill, if a
 16 32 substance has not been designated as an imitation controlled
 16 33 substance by the board of pharmacy and when dosage unit
 16 34 appearance alone does not establish that a substance is an

 17 16 commits the following offense: a class "B" felony punishable
 17 17 by confinement of no more than 50 years and a fine of not more
 17 18 than $1 million if the imitation controlled substance is more
 17 19 than 10 kilograms; a class "B" felony punishable by confinement
 17 20 of no more than 25 years and a fine of not less than $5,000 but
 17 21 not more than $100,000 if the imitation controlled substance
 17 22 is more than five kilograms but not more than 10 kilograms; a
 17 23 class "C" felony punishable by a fine of not less than $1,000
 17 24 but not more than $50,000 if the imitation controlled substance
 17 25 is five kilograms or less; or an aggravated misdemeanor if the
 17 26 imitation controlled substance is classified in schedule IV or
 17 27 V; or a serious misdemeanor for a first possession offense,
 17 28 an aggravated misdemeanor for a second possession offense,
 17 29 or a class "D" felony for two or more previous possession
 17 30 offenses. Current law in Code section 124A.4 provides that if
 17 31 a person unlawfully manufactures, delivers, or possesses with
 17 32 intent to deliver an imitation controlled substance, the person
 17 33 commits an aggravated misdemeanor, or if the person delivers
 17 34 to a person under 18 years of age who is at least three years
 17 35 younger than the violator, the person commits a class "D"
 18  1 felony.  In addition, under current law, if a person unlawfully
 18  2 and knowingly publishes an advertisement or distributes in a
 18  3 public place a promotion for an imitation controlled substance
 18  4 the person commits a serious misdemeanor.
 18  5    The bill enhances the criminal penalties for controlled
 18  6 substances classified in Code sections 124.204(4)(ai) and
 18  7 124.204(6)(i) from an aggravated misdemeanor to a class "C"
 18  8 felony punishable pursuant to Code section 124.401(1)(c)(8).
 18  9 This change equalizes the criminal penalties with violations
 18 10 involving other schedule I controlled substances.
 18 11    The bill provides that if the same person commits two or
 18 12 more acts which are in violation of Code section 124.401(1)
 18 13 and the acts occur in the same location or time period so the
 18 14 acts are attributable to a single scheme, the acts may be
 18 15 considered a single violation and the weights of the imitation
 18 16 controlled substance may be combined for purposes of charging
 18 17 the offender.
 18 18    The amendment to Code section 124.401A provides that
 18 19 a person who is 18 years of age or older who unlawfully
 18 20 manufactures with the intent to distribute, distributes,
 18 21 or possesses with the intent to distribute an imitation
 18 22 controlled substance to another person 18 years of age or older
 18 23 within 1,000 feet of the real property comprising a public or
 18 24 nonpublic school, may be sentenced up to an additional term of
 18 25 confinement of five years in addition to any other penalty.
 18 26    The amendment to Code section 124.401B provides that
 18 27 a person who unlawfully possesses an imitation controlled
 18 28 substance within 1,000 feet of the real property comprising a
 18 29 school, public park, public pool, public recreation center, or
 18 30 marked school bus may be sentenced up to 100 hours of community
 18 31 service.
 18 32    The amendments to Code section 124.406 relate to the
 18 33 distribution or possession with the intent to distribute an
 18 34 imitation controlled substance to a person under 18 years of
 18 35 age.  A person who distributes or possesses with the intent to
 19  1 distribute an imitation controlled substance, represented to
 19  2 be a substance listed in schedule I or schedule II, to a person
 19  3 under 18 years of age commits a class "B" felony. The required
 19  4 penalty for such a violation is a minimum term of confinement
 19  5 of 10 years if the substance was distributed within 1,000
 19  6 feet of the real property comprising a public or nonpublic
 19  7 school, public park, public pool, or public recreation center.
 19  8 A person who distributes or possesses with the intent to
 19  9 distribute an imitation controlled substance, represented to be
 19 10 a substance listed in schedule III, to a person under 18 years
 19 11 of age, who is at least three years younger than the violator,
 19 12 commits a class "C" felony.  A person who distributes or
 19 13 possesses with the intent to distribute an imitation controlled
 19 14 substance, represented to be a substance listed in schedule
 19 15 IV or schedule V, to a person under 18 years of age, who is
 19 16 at least three years younger than the violator, commits an
 19 17 aggravated misdemeanor.
 19 18    The amendment to Code section 124.415 requires that a peace
 19 19 officer make a reasonable effort to identify a person under 18
 19 20 years of age discovered to be in possession of an imitation
 19 21 controlled substance, and if the person is not referred to
 19 22 juvenile court, the peace officer shall make a reasonable
 19 23 effort to notify the person's custodial parent of the
 19 24 possession unless the officer has reasonable grounds to believe
 19 25 such notification is not in the best interests of the person.
 19 26 The bill specifies that if the person is taken into custody
 19 27 the juvenile court officer shall make a reasonable effort to
 19 28 identify the school of attendance and to notify the school or
 19 29 nonpublic school of the taking into custody of the person.
 19 30    The bill creates Code section 124.417, which is similar to
 19 31 Code section 124A.5 repealed by the bill.  A person registered
 19 32 under Code section 124.302 does not violate the bill if the
 19 33 person manufactures, delivers, possesses, or possesses with the
 19 34 intent to manufacture or deliver, or acts with others to do
 19 35 such activities, if the person uses the imitation controlled
 20  1 substance for use as a placebo by a registered practitioner in
 20  2 the court of professional practice or research.
 20  3    SCHEDULE I, III, AND IV CONTROLLED SUBSTANCES.  The bill
 20  4 transfers numerous substances classified as "hallucinogenic
 20  5 substances" under schedule I and reclassifies the substances
 20  6 as "other substances" under schedule I.  By transferring the
 20  7 substances to "other substances", a person commits a class "C"
 20  8 felony under Code section 124.401(1)(c)(8) if the violation
 20  9 involves such a substance. Under current law, a person commits
 20 10 an aggravated misdemeanor under Code section 124.401(1)(d) when
 20 11 committing such violations.
 20 12    The bill adds new substances as "hallucinogenic substances"
 20 13 under schedule I.  A person commits a class "C" felony under
 20 14 Code section 124.401(1)(c)(8) if the violation involves the new
 20 15 hallucinogenic substances.
 20 16    The bill adds new substances as "stimulants" under schedule
 20 17 I.  A person commits a class "C" felony under Code section
 20 18 124.401(1)(c)(8) if the violation involves the new stimulant
 20 19 substances.
 20 20    The bill also adds new substances to the classification of
 20 21 "other substances" under schedule I.  A person commits a class
 20 22 "C" felony under Code section 124.401(1)(c)(8) for a violation
 20 23 involving the new substances.
 20 24    The bill strikes one substance classified as a
 20 25 "hallucinogenic substance" under schedule I and reclassifies
 20 26 the substance as a "stimulant" containing a synthetic cathinone
 20 27 under schedule I.  The transfer of the substance within
 20 28 schedule I also changes the criminal penalty for a violation
 20 29 involving the substance from a class "C" felony under Code
 20 30 section 124.401(1)(c)(8) to an aggravated misdemeanor under
 20 31 Code section 124.401(1)(d).  The bill also strikes a substance
 20 32 in Code section 124.204(6)(i)(3) from schedule I and does not
 20 33 reclassify the substance in any other substance schedule.
 20 34    The bill also removes numerous substances from schedule I
 20 35 which are currently classified as "stimulants" in Code section
 21  1 124.204(6)(i).
 21  2    The bill also strikes two narcotic substances from schedule
 21  3 III and adds three substances to schedule IV.  A violation
 21  4 involving a schedule IV controlled substance is punishable as
 21  5 an aggravated misdemeanor in Code section 124.401(1)(d).

 16  1 a common scheme or design with, or conspires with one or more
 16  2 persons to manufacture, deliver, or possess such a controlled
 16  3 substance, the person commits the following offenses: a class
 16  4 "B" felony punishable by confinement of no more than 50 years
 16  5 and a fine of not more than $1 million if the controlled
 16  6 substance containing cocaine base is more than 125 grams rather
 16  7 than the current 50 grams; a class "B" felony punishable by
 16  8 confinement of no more than 25 years and a fine of not less than
 16  9 $5,000 but not more than $100,000 if the imitation controlled
 16 10 substance is more than 35 grams but not more than 125 grams
 16 11 rather than the current 10 to 50 grams; or a class "C" felony
 16 12 punishable by a fine of not less than $1,000 but not more than
 16 13 $50,000 if the controlled substance containing cocaine base is
 16 14 35 grams or less rather than the current 10 grams or less.
 16 15    IMITATION CONTROLLED SUBSTANCES.  Under current law
 16 16 imitation controlled substances are regulated under Code
 16 17 chapter 124A.  The bill repeals Code chapter 124A and transfers
 16 18 the regulation of imitation controlled substances to Code
 16 19 chapter 124.  The definition and designation of an imitation
 16 20 controlled substance in Code chapter 124 remains identical
 16 21 to the definition and designation of an imitation controlled
 16 22 substance under current law in Code chapter 124A.
 16 23    Under the bill and in current law, an imitation controlled
 16 24 substance means a substance which is not a controlled substance
 16 25 but by color, shape, size, markings, and other aspects of
 16 26 dosage unit appearance, and packaging or other factors, appears
 16 27 to be or resembles a controlled substance. The board of
 16 28 pharmacy may designate a substance as an imitation controlled
 16 29 substance pursuant to the board's rulemaking authority and in
 16 30 accordance with Code chapter 17A.
 16 31    In addition, under current law and in the bill, if a
 16 32 substance has not been designated as an imitation controlled
 16 33 substance by the board of pharmacy and when dosage unit
 16 34 appearance alone does not establish that a substance is an
 16 35 imitation controlled substance, the following factors may
 17  1 be considered in determining whether the substance is an
 17  2 imitation controlled substance: the substance is represented
 17  3 as having the effect of a controlled substance; the substance
 17  4 is represented as a controlled substance or as a substitute for
 17  5 a controlled substance because of its nature or appearance;
 17  6 or a person receives money or other property having a value
 17  7 substantially greater than the actual value of the substance
 17  8 when sold.
 17  9    Under the bill, if a person unlawfully manufactures,
 17 10 delivers, or possesses with the intent to deliver an imitation
 17 11 controlled substance containing any detectable amount of those
 17 12 substances identified in Code section 124.204(9), or unlawfully
 17 13 acts with, enters into a common scheme or design with, or
 17 14 conspires with one or more persons to manufacture, deliver,
 17 15 or possess such imitation controlled substances, the person
 17 16 commits the following offense: a class "B" felony punishable
 17 17 by confinement of no more than 50 years and a fine of not more
 17 18 than $1 million if the imitation controlled substance is more
 17 19 than 10 kilograms; a class "B" felony punishable by confinement
 17 20 of no more than 25 years and a fine of not less than $5,000 but
 17 21 not more than $100,000 if the imitation controlled substance
 17 22 is more than five kilograms but not more than 10 kilograms; a
 17 23 class "C" felony punishable by a fine of not less than $1,000
 17 24 but not more than $50,000 if the imitation controlled substance
 17 25 is five kilograms or less; or an aggravated misdemeanor if the
 17 26 imitation controlled substance is classified in schedule IV or
 17 27 V; or a serious misdemeanor for a first possession offense,
 17 28 an aggravated misdemeanor for a second possession offense,
 17 29 or a class "D" felony for two or more previous possession
 17 30 offenses. Current law in Code section 124A.4 provides that if
 17 31 a person unlawfully manufactures, delivers, or possesses with
 17 32 intent to deliver an imitation controlled substance, the person
 17 33 commits an aggravated misdemeanor, or if the person delivers
 17 34 to a person under 18 years of age who is at least three years
 17 35 younger than the violator, the person commits a class "D"
 18  1 felony.  In addition, under current law, if a person unlawfully
 18  2 and knowingly publishes an advertisement or distributes in a
 18  3 public place a promotion for an imitation controlled substance
 18  4 the person commits a serious misdemeanor.
 18  5    The bill enhances the criminal penalties for controlled
 18  6 substances classified in Code sections 124.204(4)(ai) and
 18  7 124.204(6)(i) from an aggravated misdemeanor to a class "C"
 18  8 felony punishable pursuant to Code section 124.401(1)(c)(8).
 18  9 This change equalizes the criminal penalties with violations
 18 10 involving other schedule I controlled substances.
 18 11    The bill provides that if the same person commits two or
 18 12 more acts which are in violation of Code section 124.401(1)
 18 13 and the acts occur in the same location or time period so the
 18 14 acts are attributable to a single scheme, the acts may be
 18 15 considered a single violation and the weights of the imitation
 18 16 controlled substance may be combined for purposes of charging
 18 17 the offender.
 18 18    The amendment to Code section 124.401A provides that
 18 19 a person who is 18 years of age or older who unlawfully
 18 20 manufactures with the intent to distribute, distributes,
 18 21 or possesses with the intent to distribute an imitation
 18 22 controlled substance to another person 18 years of age or older
 18 23 within 1,000 feet of the real property comprising a public or
 18 24 nonpublic school, may be sentenced up to an additional term of
 18 25 confinement of five years in addition to any other penalty.
 18 26    The amendment to Code section 124.401B provides that
 18 27 a person who unlawfully possesses an imitation controlled
 18 28 substance within 1,000 feet of the real property comprising a
 18 29 school, public park, public pool, public recreation center, or
 18 30 marked school bus may be sentenced up to 100 hours of community
 18 31 service.
 18 32    The amendments to Code section 124.406 relate to the
 18 33 distribution or possession with the intent to distribute an
 18 34 imitation controlled substance to a person under 18 years of
 18 35 age.  A person who distributes or possesses with the intent to
 19  1 distribute an imitation controlled substance, represented to
 19  2 be a substance listed in schedule I or schedule II, to a person
 19  3 under 18 years of age commits a class "B" felony. The required
 19  4 penalty for such a violation is a minimum term of confinement
 19  5 of 10 years if the substance was distributed within 1,000
 19  6 feet of the real property comprising a public or nonpublic
 19  7 school, public park, public pool, or public recreation center.
 19  8 A person who distributes or possesses with the intent to
 19  9 distribute an imitation controlled substance, represented to be
 19 10 a substance listed in schedule III, to a person under 18 years
 19 11 of age, who is at least three years younger than the violator,
 19 12 commits a class "C" felony.  A person who distributes or
 19 13 possesses with the intent to distribute an imitation controlled
 19 14 substance, represented to be a substance listed in schedule
 19 15 IV or schedule V, to a person under 18 years of age, who is
 19 16 at least three years younger than the violator, commits an
 19 17 aggravated misdemeanor.
 19 18    The amendment to Code section 124.415 requires that a peace
 19 19 officer make a reasonable effort to identify a person under 18
 19 20 years of age discovered to be in possession of an imitation
 19 21 controlled substance, and if the person is not referred to
 19 22 juvenile court, the peace officer shall make a reasonable
 19 23 effort to notify the person's custodial parent of the
 19 24 possession unless the officer has reasonable grounds to believe
 19 25 such notification is not in the best interests of the person.
 19 26 The bill specifies that if the person is taken into custody
 19 27 the juvenile court officer shall make a reasonable effort to
 19 28 identify the school of attendance and to notify the school or
 19 29 nonpublic school of the taking into custody of the person.
 19 30    The bill creates Code section 124.417, which is similar to
 19 31 Code section 124A.5 repealed by the bill.  A person registered
 19 32 under Code section 124.302 does not violate the bill if the
 19 33 person manufactures, delivers, possesses, or possesses with the
 19 34 intent to manufacture or deliver, or acts with others to do
 19 35 such activities, if the person uses the imitation controlled
 20  1 substance for use as a placebo by a registered practitioner in
 20  2 the court of professional practice or research.
 20  3    SCHEDULE I, III, AND IV CONTROLLED SUBSTANCES.  The bill
 20  4 transfers numerous substances classified as "hallucinogenic
 20  5 substances" under schedule I and reclassifies the substances
 20  6 as "other substances" under schedule I.  By transferring the
 20  7 substances to "other substances", a person commits a class "C"
 20  8 felony under Code section 124.401(1)(c)(8) if the violation
 20  9 involves such a substance. Under current law, a person commits
 20 10 an aggravated misdemeanor under Code section 124.401(1)(d) when
 20 11 committing such violations.
 20 12    The bill adds new substances as "hallucinogenic substances"
 20 13 under schedule I.  A person commits a class "C" felony under
 20 14 Code section 124.401(1)(c)(8) if the violation involves the new
 20 15 hallucinogenic substances.
 20 16    The bill adds new substances as "stimulants" under schedule
 20 17 I.  A person commits a class "C" felony under Code section
 20 18 124.401(1)(c)(8) if the violation involves the new stimulant
 20 19 substances.
 20 20    The bill also adds new substances to the classification of
 20 21 "other substances" under schedule I.  A person commits a class
 20 22 "C" felony under Code section 124.401(1)(c)(8) for a violation
 20 23 involving the new substances.
 20 24    The bill strikes one substance classified as a
 20 25 "hallucinogenic substance" under schedule I and reclassifies
 20 26 the substance as a "stimulant" containing a synthetic cathinone
 20 27 under schedule I.  The transfer of the substance within
 20 28 schedule I also changes the criminal penalty for a violation
 20 29 involving the substance from a class "C" felony under Code
 20 30 section 124.401(1)(c)(8) to an aggravated misdemeanor under
 20 31 Code section 124.401(1)(d).  The bill also strikes a substance
 20 32 in Code section 124.204(6)(i)(3) from schedule I and does not
 20 33 reclassify the substance in any other substance schedule.
 20 34    The bill also removes numerous substances from schedule I
 20 35 which are currently classified as "stimulants" in Code section
 21  1 124.204(6)(i).
 21  2    The bill also strikes two narcotic substances from schedule
 21  3 III and adds three substances to schedule IV.  A violation
 21  4 involving a schedule IV controlled substance is punishable as

 16 20 controlled substance in Code chapter 124 remains identical

 16 29 substance pursuant to the board's rulemaking authority and in
 16 30 accordance with Code chapter 17A.
 16 31    In addition, under current law and in the bill, if a

 16 34 appearance alone does not establish that a substance is an

 18 12 more acts which are in violation of Code section 124.401(1)
 18 13 and the acts occur in the same location or time period so the
 18 14 acts are attributable to a single scheme, the acts may be
 18 15 considered a single violation and the weights of the imitation
 18 16 controlled substance may be combined for purposes of charging
 18 17 the offender.
 18 18    The amendment to Code section 124.401A provides that
 18 19 a person who is 18 years of age or older who unlawfully
 18 20 manufactures with the intent to distribute, distributes,
 18 21 or possesses with the intent to distribute an imitation
 18 22 controlled substance to another person 18 years of age or older
 18 23 within 1,000 feet of the real property comprising a public or
 18 24 nonpublic school, may be sentenced up to an additional term of
 18 25 confinement of five years in addition to any other penalty.
 18 26    The amendment to Code section 124.401B provides that
 18 27 a person who unlawfully possesses an imitation controlled
 18 28 substance within 1,000 feet of the real property comprising a
 18 29 school, public park, public pool, public recreation center, or
 18 30 marked school bus may be sentenced up to 100 hours of community
 18 31 service.
 18 32    The amendments to Code section 124.406 relate to the
 18 33 distribution or possession with the intent to distribute an
 18 34 imitation controlled substance to a person under 18 years of
 18 35 age.  A person who distributes or possesses with the intent to
 19  1 distribute an imitation controlled substance, represented to
 19  2 be a substance listed in schedule I or schedule II, to a person
 19  3 under 18 years of age commits a class "B" felony. The required
 19  4 penalty for such a violation is a minimum term of confinement
 19  5 of 10 years if the substance was distributed within 1,000
 19  6 feet of the real property comprising a public or nonpublic
 19  7 school, public park, public pool, or public recreation center.
 19  8 A person who distributes or possesses with the intent to
 19  9 distribute an imitation controlled substance, represented to be
 19 10 a substance listed in schedule III, to a person under 18 years
 19 11 of age, who is at least three years younger than the violator,
 19 12 commits a class "C" felony.  A person who distributes or
 19 13 possesses with the intent to distribute an imitation controlled
 19 14 substance, represented to be a substance listed in schedule
 19 15 IV or schedule V, to a person under 18 years of age, who is
 19 16 at least three years younger than the violator, commits an
 19 17 aggravated misdemeanor.
 19 18    The amendment to Code section 124.415 requires that a peace
 19 19 officer make a reasonable effort to identify a person under 18
 19 20 years of age discovered to be in possession of an imitation
 19 21 controlled substance, and if the person is not referred to
 19 22 juvenile court, the peace officer shall make a reasonable
 19 23 effort to notify the person's custodial parent of the
 19 24 possession unless the officer has reasonable grounds to believe
 19 25 such notification is not in the best interests of the person.
 19 26 The bill specifies that if the person is taken into custody
 19 27 the juvenile court officer shall make a reasonable effort to
 19 28 identify the school of attendance and to notify the school or
 19 29 nonpublic school of the taking into custody of the person.
 19 30    The bill creates Code section 124.417, which is similar to
 19 31 Code section 124A.5 repealed by the bill.  A person registered
 19 32 under Code section 124.302 does not violate the bill if the
 19 33 person manufactures, delivers, possesses, or possesses with the
 19 34 intent to manufacture or deliver, or acts with others to do
 19 35 such activities, if the person uses the imitation controlled
 20  1 substance for use as a placebo by a registered practitioner in
 20  2 the court of professional practice or research.
 20  3    SCHEDULE I, III, AND IV CONTROLLED SUBSTANCES.  The bill
 20  4 transfers numerous substances classified as "hallucinogenic
 20  5 substances" under schedule I and reclassifies the substances
 20  6 as "other substances" under schedule I.  By transferring the
 20  7 substances to "other substances", a person commits a class "C"
 20  8 felony under Code section 124.401(1)(c)(8) if the violation
 20  9 involves such a substance. Under current law, a person commits
 20 10 an aggravated misdemeanor under Code section 124.401(1)(d) when
 20 11 committing such violations.
 20 12    The bill adds new substances as "hallucinogenic substances"
 20 13 under schedule I.  A person commits a class "C" felony under
 20 14 Code section 124.401(1)(c)(8) if the violation involves the new
 20 15 hallucinogenic substances.
 20 16    The bill adds new substances as "stimulants" under schedule
 20 17 I.  A person commits a class "C" felony under Code section
 20 18 124.401(1)(c)(8) if the violation involves the new stimulant
 20 19 substances.
 20 20    The bill also adds new substances to the classification of
 20 21 "other substances" under schedule I.  A person commits a class
 20 22 "C" felony under Code section 124.401(1)(c)(8) for a violation
 20 23 involving the new substances.
 20 24    The bill strikes one substance classified as a
 20 25 "hallucinogenic substance" under schedule I and reclassifies
 20 26 the substance as a "stimulant" containing a synthetic cathinone
 20 27 under schedule I.  The transfer of the substance within
 20 28 schedule I also changes the criminal penalty for a violation
 20 29 involving the substance from a class "C" felony under Code
 20 30 section 124.401(1)(c)(8) to an aggravated misdemeanor under
 20 31 Code section 124.401(1)(d).  The bill also strikes a substance
 20 32 in Code section 124.204(6)(i)(3) from schedule I and does not
 20 33 reclassify the substance in any other substance schedule.
 20 34    The bill also removes numerous substances from schedule I
 20 35 which are currently classified as "stimulants" in Code section
 21  1 124.204(6)(i).
 21  2    The bill also strikes two narcotic substances from schedule
 21  3 III and adds three substances to schedule IV.  A violation
 21  4 involving a schedule IV controlled substance is punishable as
 21  5 an aggravated misdemeanor in Code section 124.401(1)(d).

 16  2 persons to manufacture, deliver, or possess such a controlled
 16  3 substance, the person commits the following offenses: a class
 16  4 "B" felony punishable by confinement of no more than 50 years
 16  5 and a fine of not more than $1 million if the controlled
 16  6 substance containing cocaine base is more than 125 grams rather
 16  7 than the current 50 grams; a class "B" felony punishable by
 16  8 confinement of no more than 25 years and a fine of not less than
 16  9 $5,000 but not more than $100,000 if the imitation controlled
 16 10 substance is more than 35 grams but not more than 125 grams
 16 11 rather than the current 10 to 50 grams; or a class "C" felony
 16 12 punishable by a fine of not less than $1,000 but not more than
 16 13 $50,000 if the controlled substance containing cocaine base is
 16 14 35 grams or less rather than the current 10 grams or less.
 16 15    IMITATION CONTROLLED SUBSTANCES.  Under current law
 16 16 imitation controlled substances are regulated under Code
 16 17 chapter 124A.  The bill repeals Code chapter 124A and transfers
 16 18 the regulation of imitation controlled substances to Code
 16 19 chapter 124.  The definition and designation of an imitation
 16 20 controlled substance in Code chapter 124 remains identical
 16 21 to the definition and designation of an imitation controlled
 16 22 substance under current law in Code chapter 124A.
 16 23    Under the bill and in current law, an imitation controlled
 16 24 substance means a substance which is not a controlled substance
 16 25 but by color, shape, size, markings, and other aspects of
 16 26 dosage unit appearance, and packaging or other factors, appears
 16 27 to be or resembles a controlled substance. The board of
 16 28 pharmacy may designate a substance as an imitation controlled
 16 29 substance pursuant to the board's rulemaking authority and in
 16 30 accordance with Code chapter 17A.
 16 31    In addition, under current law and in the bill, if a
 16 32 substance has not been designated as an imitation controlled
 16 33 substance by the board of pharmacy and when dosage unit
 16 34 appearance alone does not establish that a substance is an
 16 35 imitation controlled substance, the following factors may
 17  1 be considered in determining whether the substance is an
 17  2 imitation controlled substance: the substance is represented
 17  3 as having the effect of a controlled substance; the substance
 17  4 is represented as a controlled substance or as a substitute for
 17  5 a controlled substance because of its nature or appearance;
 17  6 or a person receives money or other property having a value
 17  7 substantially greater than the actual value of the substance
 17  8 when sold.
 17  9    Under the bill, if a person unlawfully manufactures,
 17 10 delivers, or possesses with the intent to deliver an imitation
 17 11 controlled substance containing any detectable amount of those
 17 12 substances identified in Code section 124.204(9), or unlawfully
 17 13 acts with, enters into a common scheme or design with, or
 17 14 conspires with one or more persons to manufacture, deliver,
 17 15 or possess such imitation controlled substances, the person
 17 16 commits the following offense: a class "B" felony punishable
 17 17 by confinement of no more than 50 years and a fine of not more
 17 18 than $1 million if the imitation controlled substance is more
 17 19 than 10 kilograms; a class "B" felony punishable by confinement
 17 20 of no more than 25 years and a fine of not less than $5,000 but
 17 21 not more than $100,000 if the imitation controlled substance
 17 22 is more than five kilograms but not more than 10 kilograms; a
 17 23 class "C" felony punishable by a fine of not less than $1,000
 17 24 but not more than $50,000 if the imitation controlled substance
 17 25 is five kilograms or less; or an aggravated misdemeanor if the
 17 26 imitation controlled substance is classified in schedule IV or
 17 27 V; or a serious misdemeanor for a first possession offense,
 17 28 an aggravated misdemeanor for a second possession offense,
 17 29 or a class "D" felony for two or more previous possession
 17 30 offenses. Current law in Code section 124A.4 provides that if
 17 31 a person unlawfully manufactures, delivers, or possesses with
 17 32 intent to deliver an imitation controlled substance, the person
 17 33 commits an aggravated misdemeanor, or if the person delivers
 17 34 to a person under 18 years of age who is at least three years
 17 35 younger than the violator, the person commits a class "D"
 18  1 felony.  In addition, under current law, if a person unlawfully
 18  2 and knowingly publishes an advertisement or distributes in a
 18  3 public place a promotion for an imitation controlled substance
 18  4 the person commits a serious misdemeanor.
 18  5    The bill enhances the criminal penalties for controlled
 18  6 substances classified in Code sections 124.204(4)(ai) and
 18  7 124.204(6)(i) from an aggravated misdemeanor to a class "C"
 18  8 felony punishable pursuant to Code section 124.401(1)(c)(8).
 18  9 This change equalizes the criminal penalties with violations
 18 10 involving other schedule I controlled substances.
 18 11    The bill provides that if the same person commits two or
 18 12 more acts which are in violation of Code section 124.401(1)
 18 13 and the acts occur in the same location or time period so the
 18 14 acts are attributable to a single scheme, the acts may be
 18 15 considered a single violation and the weights of the imitation
 18 16 controlled substance may be combined for purposes of charging
 18 17 the offender.
 18 18    The amendment to Code section 124.401A provides that
 18 19 a person who is 18 years of age or older who unlawfully
 18 20 manufactures with the intent to distribute, distributes,
 18 21 or possesses with the intent to distribute an imitation
 18 22 controlled substance to another person 18 years of age or older
 18 23 within 1,000 feet of the real property comprising a public or
 18 24 nonpublic school, may be sentenced up to an additional term of
 18 25 confinement of five years in addition to any other penalty.
 18 26    The amendment to Code section 124.401B provides that
 18 27 a person who unlawfully possesses an imitation controlled
 18 28 substance within 1,000 feet of the real property comprising a
 18 29 school, public park, public pool, public recreation center, or
 18 30 marked school bus may be sentenced up to 100 hours of community
 18 31 service.
 18 32    The amendments to Code section 124.406 relate to the
 18 33 distribution or possession with the intent to distribute an
 18 34 imitation controlled substance to a person under 18 years of
 18 35 age.  A person who distributes or possesses with the intent to
 19  1 distribute an imitation controlled substance, represented to
 19  2 be a substance listed in schedule I or schedule II, to a person
 19  3 under 18 years of age commits a class "B" felony. The required
 19  4 penalty for such a violation is a minimum term of confinement
 19  5 of 10 years if the substance was distributed within 1,000
 19  6 feet of the real property comprising a public or nonpublic
 19  7 school, public park, public pool, or public recreation center.
 19  8 A person who distributes or possesses with the intent to
 19  9 distribute an imitation controlled substance, represented to be
 19 10 a substance listed in schedule III, to a person under 18 years
 19 11 of age, who is at least three years younger than the violator,
 19 12 commits a class "C" felony.  A person who distributes or
 19 13 possesses with the intent to distribute an imitation controlled
 19 14 substance, represented to be a substance listed in schedule
 19 15 IV or schedule V, to a person under 18 years of age, who is
 19 16 at least three years younger than the violator, commits an
 19 17 aggravated misdemeanor.
 19 18    The amendment to Code section 124.415 requires that a peace
 19 19 officer make a reasonable effort to identify a person under 18
 19 20 years of age discovered to be in possession of an imitation
 19 21 controlled substance, and if the person is not referred to
 19 22 juvenile court, the peace officer shall make a reasonable
 19 23 effort to notify the person's custodial parent of the
 19 24 possession unless the officer has reasonable grounds to believe
 19 25 such notification is not in the best interests of the person.
 19 26 The bill specifies that if the person is taken into custody
 19 27 the juvenile court officer shall make a reasonable effort to
 19 28 identify the school of attendance and to notify the school or
 19 29 nonpublic school of the taking into custody of the person.
 19 30    The bill creates Code section 124.417, which is similar to
 19 31 Code section 124A.5 repealed by the bill.  A person registered
 19 32 under Code section 124.302 does not violate the bill if the
 19 33 person manufactures, delivers, possesses, or possesses with the
 19 34 intent to manufacture or deliver, or acts with others to do
 19 35 such activities, if the person uses the imitation controlled
 20  1 substance for use as a placebo by a registered practitioner in
 20  2 the court of professional practice or research.

 20  4 transfers numerous substances classified as "hallucinogenic
 20  5 substances" under schedule I and reclassifies the substances

 20  7 substances to "other substances", a person commits a class "C"
 20  8 felony under Code section 124.401(1)(c)(8) if the violation
 20  9 involves such a substance. Under current law, a person commits
 20 10 an aggravated misdemeanor under Code section 124.401(1)(d) when
 20 11 committing such violations.
 20 12    The bill adds new substances as "hallucinogenic substances"
 20 13 under schedule I.  A person commits a class "C" felony under
 20 14 Code section 124.401(1)(c)(8) if the violation involves the new
 20 15 hallucinogenic substances.
 20 16    The bill adds new substances as "stimulants" under schedule
 20 17 I.  A person commits a class "C" felony under Code section
 20 18 124.401(1)(c)(8) if the violation involves the new stimulant
 20 19 substances.
 20 20    The bill also adds new substances to the classification of
 20 21 "other substances" under schedule I.  A person commits a class
 20 22 "C" felony under Code section 124.401(1)(c)(8) for a violation
 20 23 involving the new substances.
 20 24    The bill strikes one substance classified as a
 20 25 "hallucinogenic substance" under schedule I and reclassifies
 20 26 the substance as a "stimulant" containing a synthetic cathinone
 20 27 under schedule I.  The transfer of the substance within
 20 28 schedule I also changes the criminal penalty for a violation
 20 29 involving the substance from a class "C" felony under Code
 20 30 section 124.401(1)(c)(8) to an aggravated misdemeanor under
 20 31 Code section 124.401(1)(d).  The bill also strikes a substance
 20 32 in Code section 124.204(6)(i)(3) from schedule I and does not
 20 33 reclassify the substance in any other substance schedule.
 20 34    The bill also removes numerous substances from schedule I
 20 35 which are currently classified as "stimulants" in Code section

 19  8 A person who distributes or possesses with the intent to
 19  9 distribute an imitation controlled substance, represented to be
 19 10 a substance listed in schedule III, to a person under 18 years
 19 11 of age, who is at least three years younger than the violator,
 19 12 commits a class "C" felony.  A person who distributes or
 19 13 possesses with the intent to distribute an imitation controlled
 19 14 substance, represented to be a substance listed in schedule
 19 15 IV or schedule V, to a person under 18 years of age, who is
 19 16 at least three years younger than the violator, commits an
 19 17 aggravated misdemeanor.
 19 18    The amendment to Code section 124.415 requires that a peace
 19 19 officer make a reasonable effort to identify a person under 18
 19 20 years of age discovered to be in possession of an imitation
 19 21 controlled substance, and if the person is not referred to
 19 22 juvenile court, the peace officer shall make a reasonable
 19 23 effort to notify the person's custodial parent of the
 19 24 possession unless the officer has reasonable grounds to believe
 19 25 such notification is not in the best interests of the person.
 19 26 The bill specifies that if the person is taken into custody
 19 27 the juvenile court officer shall make a reasonable effort to
 19 28 identify the school of attendance and to notify the school or
 19 29 nonpublic school of the taking into custody of the person.
 19 30    The bill creates Code section 124.417, which is similar to
 19 31 Code section 124A.5 repealed by the bill.  A person registered
 19 32 under Code section 124.302 does not violate the bill if the
 19 33 person manufactures, delivers, possesses, or possesses with the
 19 34 intent to manufacture or deliver, or acts with others to do
 19 35 such activities, if the person uses the imitation controlled
 20  1 substance for use as a placebo by a registered practitioner in
 20  2 the court of professional practice or research.
 20  3    SCHEDULE I, III, AND IV CONTROLLED SUBSTANCES.  The bill
 20  4 transfers numerous substances classified as "hallucinogenic
 20  5 substances" under schedule I and reclassifies the substances
 20  6 as "other substances" under schedule I.  By transferring the
 20  7 substances to "other substances", a person commits a class "C"
 20  8 felony under Code section 124.401(1)(c)(8) if the violation
 20  9 involves such a substance. Under current law, a person commits
 20 10 an aggravated misdemeanor under Code section 124.401(1)(d) when
 20 11 committing such violations.
 20 12    The bill adds new substances as "hallucinogenic substances"
 20 13 under schedule I.  A person commits a class "C" felony under
 20 14 Code section 124.401(1)(c)(8) if the violation involves the new
 20 15 hallucinogenic substances.
 20 16    The bill adds new substances as "stimulants" under schedule
 20 17 I.  A person commits a class "C" felony under Code section
 20 18 124.401(1)(c)(8) if the violation involves the new stimulant
 20 19 substances.
 20 20    The bill also adds new substances to the classification of
 20 21 "other substances" under schedule I.  A person commits a class
 20 22 "C" felony under Code section 124.401(1)(c)(8) for a violation
 20 23 involving the new substances.
 20 24    The bill strikes one substance classified as a
 20 25 "hallucinogenic substance" under schedule I and reclassifies
 20 26 the substance as a "stimulant" containing a synthetic cathinone
 20 27 under schedule I.  The transfer of the substance within
 20 28 schedule I also changes the criminal penalty for a violation
 20 29 involving the substance from a class "C" felony under Code
 20 30 section 124.401(1)(c)(8) to an aggravated misdemeanor under
 20 31 Code section 124.401(1)(d).  The bill also strikes a substance
 20 32 in Code section 124.204(6)(i)(3) from schedule I and does not
 20 33 reclassify the substance in any other substance schedule.
 20 34    The bill also removes numerous substances from schedule I
 20 35 which are currently classified as "stimulants" in Code section
 21  1 124.204(6)(i).
 21  2    The bill also strikes two narcotic substances from schedule
 21  3 III and adds three substances to schedule IV.  A violation
 21  4 involving a schedule IV controlled substance is punishable as
 21  5 an aggravated misdemeanor in Code section 124.401(1)(d).

 16  4 "B" felony punishable by confinement of no more than 50 years
 16  5 and a fine of not more than $1 million if the controlled
 16  6 substance containing cocaine base is more than 125 grams rather
 16  7 than the current 50 grams; a class "B" felony punishable by
 16  8 confinement of no more than 25 years and a fine of not less than
 16  9 $5,000 but not more than $100,000 if the imitation controlled
 16 10 substance is more than 35 grams but not more than 125 grams
 16 11 rather than the current 10 to 50 grams; or a class "C" felony
 16 12 punishable by a fine of not less than $1,000 but not more than
 16 13 $50,000 if the controlled substance containing cocaine base is
 16 14 35 grams or less rather than the current 10 grams or less.
 16 15    IMITATION CONTROLLED SUBSTANCES.  Under current law
 16 16 imitation controlled substances are regulated under Code
 16 17 chapter 124A.  The bill repeals Code chapter 124A and transfers
 16 18 the regulation of imitation controlled substances to Code
 16 19 chapter 124.  The definition and designation of an imitation
 16 20 controlled substance in Code chapter 124 remains identical
 16 21 to the definition and designation of an imitation controlled
 16 22 substance under current law in Code chapter 124A.
 16 23    Under the bill and in current law, an imitation controlled
 16 24 substance means a substance which is not a controlled substance
 16 25 but by color, shape, size, markings, and other aspects of
 16 26 dosage unit appearance, and packaging or other factors, appears
 16 27 to be or resembles a controlled substance. The board of
 16 28 pharmacy may designate a substance as an imitation controlled
 16 29 substance pursuant to the board's rulemaking authority and in
 16 30 accordance with Code chapter 17A.
 16 31    In addition, under current law and in the bill, if a
 16 32 substance has not been designated as an imitation controlled
 16 33 substance by the board of pharmacy and when dosage unit
 16 34 appearance alone does not establish that a substance is an
 16 35 imitation controlled substance, the following factors may
 17  1 be considered in determining whether the substance is an
 17  2 imitation controlled substance: the substance is represented
 17  3 as having the effect of a controlled substance; the substance
 17  4 is represented as a controlled substance or as a substitute for
 17  5 a controlled substance because of its nature or appearance;
 17  6 or a person receives money or other property having a value
 17  7 substantially greater than the actual value of the substance
 17  8 when sold.
 17  9    Under the bill, if a person unlawfully manufactures,
 17 10 delivers, or possesses with the intent to deliver an imitation
 17 11 controlled substance containing any detectable amount of those
 17 12 substances identified in Code section 124.204(9), or unlawfully
 17 13 acts with, enters into a common scheme or design with, or
 17 14 conspires with one or more persons to manufacture, deliver,
 17 15 or possess such imitation controlled substances, the person
 17 16 commits the following offense: a class "B" felony punishable
 17 17 by confinement of no more than 50 years and a fine of not more
 17 18 than $1 million if the imitation controlled substance is more
 17 19 than 10 kilograms; a class "B" felony punishable by confinement
 17 20 of no more than 25 years and a fine of not less than $5,000 but
 17 21 not more than $100,000 if the imitation controlled substance
 17 22 is more than five kilograms but not more than 10 kilograms; a
 17 23 class "C" felony punishable by a fine of not less than $1,000
 17 24 but not more than $50,000 if the imitation controlled substance
 17 25 is five kilograms or less; or an aggravated misdemeanor if the
 17 26 imitation controlled substance is classified in schedule IV or
 17 27 V; or a serious misdemeanor for a first possession offense,
 17 28 an aggravated misdemeanor for a second possession offense,
 17 29 or a class "D" felony for two or more previous possession
 17 30 offenses. Current law in Code section 124A.4 provides that if
 17 31 a person unlawfully manufactures, delivers, or possesses with
 17 32 intent to deliver an imitation controlled substance, the person
 17 33 commits an aggravated misdemeanor, or if the person delivers
 17 34 to a person under 18 years of age who is at least three years
 17 35 younger than the violator, the person commits a class "D"
 18  1 felony.  In addition, under current law, if a person unlawfully
 18  2 and knowingly publishes an advertisement or distributes in a
 18  3 public place a promotion for an imitation controlled substance
 18  4 the person commits a serious misdemeanor.
 18  5    The bill enhances the criminal penalties for controlled
 18  6 substances classified in Code sections 124.204(4)(ai) and
 18  7 124.204(6)(i) from an aggravated misdemeanor to a class "C"
 18  8 felony punishable pursuant to Code section 124.401(1)(c)(8).
 18  9 This change equalizes the criminal penalties with violations
 18 10 involving other schedule I controlled substances.
 18 11    The bill provides that if the same person commits two or
 18 12 more acts which are in violation of Code section 124.401(1)
 18 13 and the acts occur in the same location or time period so the
 18 14 acts are attributable to a single scheme, the acts may be
 18 15 considered a single violation and the weights of the imitation
 18 16 controlled substance may be combined for purposes of charging
 18 17 the offender.
 18 18    The amendment to Code section 124.401A provides that
 18 19 a person who is 18 years of age or older who unlawfully
 18 20 manufactures with the intent to distribute, distributes,
 18 21 or possesses with the intent to distribute an imitation
 18 22 controlled substance to another person 18 years of age or older
 18 23 within 1,000 feet of the real property comprising a public or
 18 24 nonpublic school, may be sentenced up to an additional term of
 18 25 confinement of five years in addition to any other penalty.
 18 26    The amendment to Code section 124.401B provides that
 18 27 a person who unlawfully possesses an imitation controlled
 18 28 substance within 1,000 feet of the real property comprising a
 18 29 school, public park, public pool, public recreation center, or
 18 30 marked school bus may be sentenced up to 100 hours of community
 18 31 service.
 18 32    The amendments to Code section 124.406 relate to the
 18 33 distribution or possession with the intent to distribute an
 18 34 imitation controlled substance to a person under 18 years of
 18 35 age.  A person who distributes or possesses with the intent to
 19  1 distribute an imitation controlled substance, represented to
 19  2 be a substance listed in schedule I or schedule II, to a person
 19  3 under 18 years of age commits a class "B" felony. The required
 19  4 penalty for such a violation is a minimum term of confinement
 19  5 of 10 years if the substance was distributed within 1,000
 19  6 feet of the real property comprising a public or nonpublic
 19  7 school, public park, public pool, or public recreation center.
 19  8 A person who distributes or possesses with the intent to
 19  9 distribute an imitation controlled substance, represented to be
 19 10 a substance listed in schedule III, to a person under 18 years
 19 11 of age, who is at least three years younger than the violator,
 19 12 commits a class "C" felony.  A person who distributes or
 19 13 possesses with the intent to distribute an imitation controlled
 19 14 substance, represented to be a substance listed in schedule
 19 15 IV or schedule V, to a person under 18 years of age, who is
 19 16 at least three years younger than the violator, commits an
 19 17 aggravated misdemeanor.
 19 18    The amendment to Code section 124.415 requires that a peace
 19 19 officer make a reasonable effort to identify a person under 18
 19 20 years of age discovered to be in possession of an imitation
 19 21 controlled substance, and if the person is not referred to
 19 22 juvenile court, the peace officer shall make a reasonable
 19 23 effort to notify the person's custodial parent of the
 19 24 possession unless the officer has reasonable grounds to believe
 19 25 such notification is not in the best interests of the person.
 19 26 The bill specifies that if the person is taken into custody
 19 27 the juvenile court officer shall make a reasonable effort to
 19 28 identify the school of attendance and to notify the school or
 19 29 nonpublic school of the taking into custody of the person.
 19 30    The bill creates Code section 124.417, which is similar to
 19 31 Code section 124A.5 repealed by the bill.  A person registered
 19 32 under Code section 124.302 does not violate the bill if the
 19 33 person manufactures, delivers, possesses, or possesses with the
 19 34 intent to manufacture or deliver, or acts with others to do
 19 35 such activities, if the person uses the imitation controlled
 20  1 substance for use as a placebo by a registered practitioner in
 20  2 the court of professional practice or research.
 20  3    SCHEDULE I, III, AND IV CONTROLLED SUBSTANCES.  The bill
 20  4 transfers numerous substances classified as "hallucinogenic
 20  5 substances" under schedule I and reclassifies the substances
 20  6 as "other substances" under schedule I.  By transferring the
 20  7 substances to "other substances", a person commits a class "C"
 20  8 felony under Code section 124.401(1)(c)(8) if the violation
 20  9 involves such a substance. Under current law, a person commits
 20 10 an aggravated misdemeanor under Code section 124.401(1)(d) when
 20 11 committing such violations.
 20 12    The bill adds new substances as "hallucinogenic substances"
 20 13 under schedule I.  A person commits a class "C" felony under
 20 14 Code section 124.401(1)(c)(8) if the violation involves the new
 20 15 hallucinogenic substances.
 20 16    The bill adds new substances as "stimulants" under schedule
 20 17 I.  A person commits a class "C" felony under Code section
 20 18 124.401(1)(c)(8) if the violation involves the new stimulant
 20 19 substances.
 20 20    The bill also adds new substances to the classification of
 20 21 "other substances" under schedule I.  A person commits a class
 20 22 "C" felony under Code section 124.401(1)(c)(8) for a violation
 20 23 involving the new substances.
 20 24    The bill strikes one substance classified as a
 20 25 "hallucinogenic substance" under schedule I and reclassifies
 20 26 the substance as a "stimulant" containing a synthetic cathinone
 20 27 under schedule I.  The transfer of the substance within
 20 28 schedule I also changes the criminal penalty for a violation
 20 29 involving the substance from a class "C" felony under Code
 20 30 section 124.401(1)(c)(8) to an aggravated misdemeanor under
 20 31 Code section 124.401(1)(d).  The bill also strikes a substance
 20 32 in Code section 124.204(6)(i)(3) from schedule I and does not
 20 33 reclassify the substance in any other substance schedule.
 20 34    The bill also removes numerous substances from schedule I
 20 35 which are currently classified as "stimulants" in Code section
 21  1 124.204(6)(i).
 21  2    The bill also strikes two narcotic substances from schedule
 21  3 III and adds three substances to schedule IV.  A violation

 16 15    IMITATION CONTROLLED SUBSTANCES.  Under current law
 16 16 imitation controlled substances are regulated under Code
 16 17 chapter 124A.  The bill repeals Code chapter 124A and transfers
 16 18 the regulation of imitation controlled substances to Code
 16 19 chapter 124.  The definition and designation of an imitation
 16 20 controlled substance in Code chapter 124 remains identical
 16 21 to the definition and designation of an imitation controlled
 16 22 substance under current law in Code chapter 124A.
 16 23    Under the bill and in current law, an imitation controlled
 16 24 substance means a substance which is not a controlled substance
 16 25 but by color, shape, size, markings, and other aspects of
 16 26 dosage unit appearance, and packaging or other factors, appears

 16 28 pharmacy may designate a substance as an imitation controlled
 16 29 substance pursuant to the board's rulemaking authority and in
 16 30 accordance with Code chapter 17A.
 16 31    In addition, under current law and in the bill, if a
 16 32 substance has not been designated as an imitation controlled
 16 33 substance by the board of pharmacy and when dosage unit
 16 34 appearance alone does not establish that a substance is an
 16 35 imitation controlled substance, the following factors may

 17  9    Under the bill, if a person unlawfully manufactures,
 17 10 delivers, or possesses with the intent to deliver an imitation
 17 11 controlled substance containing any detectable amount of those
 17 12 substances identified in Code section 124.204(9), or unlawfully
 17 13 acts with, enters into a common scheme or design with, or
 17 14 conspires with one or more persons to manufacture, deliver,

 17 18 than $1 million if the imitation controlled substance is more
 17 19 than 10 kilograms; a class "B" felony punishable by confinement

 18 20 manufactures with the intent to distribute, distributes,

 19  1 distribute an imitation controlled substance, represented to
 19  2 be a substance listed in schedule I or schedule II, to a person
 19  3 under 18 years of age commits a class "B" felony. The required
 19  4 penalty for such a violation is a minimum term of confinement

 19 33 person manufactures, delivers, possesses, or possesses with the
 19 34 intent to manufacture or deliver, or acts with others to do
 19 35 such activities, if the person uses the imitation controlled
 20  1 substance for use as a placebo by a registered practitioner in
 20  2 the court of professional practice or research.

 20  6 as "other substances" under schedule I.  By transferring the
 20  7 substances to "other substances", a person commits a class "C"
 20  8 felony under Code section 124.401(1)(c)(8) if the violation
 20  9 involves such a substance. Under current law, a person commits
 20 10 an aggravated misdemeanor under Code section 124.401(1)(d) when
 20 11 committing such violations.
 20 12    The bill adds new substances as "hallucinogenic substances"
 20 13 under schedule I.  A person commits a class "C" felony under
 20 14 Code section 124.401(1)(c)(8) if the violation involves the new
 20 15 hallucinogenic substances.
 20 16    The bill adds new substances as "stimulants" under schedule
 20 17 I.  A person commits a class "C" felony under Code section
 20 18 124.401(1)(c)(8) if the violation involves the new stimulant
 20 19 substances.
 20 20    The bill also adds new substances to the classification of
 20 21 "other substances" under schedule I.  A person commits a class
 20 22 "C" felony under Code section 124.401(1)(c)(8) for a violation
 20 23 involving the new substances.
 20 24    The bill strikes one substance classified as a
 20 25 "hallucinogenic substance" under schedule I and reclassifies
 20 26 the substance as a "stimulant" containing a synthetic cathinone
 20 27 under schedule I.  The transfer of the substance within
 20 28 schedule I also changes the criminal penalty for a violation
 20 29 involving the substance from a class "C" felony under Code
 20 30 section 124.401(1)(c)(8) to an aggravated misdemeanor under
 20 31 Code section 124.401(1)(d).  The bill also strikes a substance
 20 32 in Code section 124.204(6)(i)(3) from schedule I and does not
 20 33 reclassify the substance in any other substance schedule.
 20 34    The bill also removes numerous substances from schedule I
 20 35 which are currently classified as "stimulants" in Code section
 21  1 124.204(6)(i).
 21  2    The bill also strikes two narcotic substances from schedule
 21  3 III and adds three substances to schedule IV.  A violation
 21  4 involving a schedule IV controlled substance is punishable as
 21  5 an aggravated misdemeanor in Code section 124.401(1)(d).

 16  6 substance containing cocaine base is more than 125 grams rather

 16  8 confinement of no more than 25 years and a fine of not less than

 16 13 $50,000 if the controlled substance containing cocaine base is
 16 14 35 grams or less rather than the current 10 grams or less.
 16 15    IMITATION CONTROLLED SUBSTANCES.  Under current law
 16 16 imitation controlled substances are regulated under Code
 16 17 chapter 124A.  The bill repeals Code chapter 124A and transfers
 16 18 the regulation of imitation controlled substances to Code
 16 19 chapter 124.  The definition and designation of an imitation
 16 20 controlled substance in Code chapter 124 remains identical
 16 21 to the definition and designation of an imitation controlled
 16 22 substance under current law in Code chapter 124A.
 16 23    Under the bill and in current law, an imitation controlled
 16 24 substance means a substance which is not a controlled substance
 16 25 but by color, shape, size, markings, and other aspects of
 16 26 dosage unit appearance, and packaging or other factors, appears
 16 27 to be or resembles a controlled substance. The board of
 16 28 pharmacy may designate a substance as an imitation controlled
 16 29 substance pursuant to the board's rulemaking authority and in
 16 30 accordance with Code chapter 17A.
 16 31    In addition, under current law and in the bill, if a
 16 32 substance has not been designated as an imitation controlled
 16 33 substance by the board of pharmacy and when dosage unit
 16 34 appearance alone does not establish that a substance is an
 16 35 imitation controlled substance, the following factors may
 17  1 be considered in determining whether the substance is an
 17  2 imitation controlled substance: the substance is represented
 17  3 as having the effect of a controlled substance; the substance
 17  4 is represented as a controlled substance or as a substitute for
 17  5 a controlled substance because of its nature or appearance;
 17  6 or a person receives money or other property having a value
 17  7 substantially greater than the actual value of the substance
 17  8 when sold.
 17  9    Under the bill, if a person unlawfully manufactures,
 17 10 delivers, or possesses with the intent to deliver an imitation
 17 11 controlled substance containing any detectable amount of those
 17 12 substances identified in Code section 124.204(9), or unlawfully
 17 13 acts with, enters into a common scheme or design with, or
 17 14 conspires with one or more persons to manufacture, deliver,
 17 15 or possess such imitation controlled substances, the person
 17 16 commits the following offense: a class "B" felony punishable
 17 17 by confinement of no more than 50 years and a fine of not more
 17 18 than $1 million if the imitation controlled substance is more
 17 19 than 10 kilograms; a class "B" felony punishable by confinement
 17 20 of no more than 25 years and a fine of not less than $5,000 but
 17 21 not more than $100,000 if the imitation controlled substance
 17 22 is more than five kilograms but not more than 10 kilograms; a
 17 23 class "C" felony punishable by a fine of not less than $1,000
 17 24 but not more than $50,000 if the imitation controlled substance
 17 25 is five kilograms or less; or an aggravated misdemeanor if the
 17 26 imitation controlled substance is classified in schedule IV or
 17 27 V; or a serious misdemeanor for a first possession offense,
 17 28 an aggravated misdemeanor for a second possession offense,
 17 29 or a class "D" felony for two or more previous possession
 17 30 offenses. Current law in Code section 124A.4 provides that if
 17 31 a person unlawfully manufactures, delivers, or possesses with
 17 32 intent to deliver an imitation controlled substance, the person
 17 33 commits an aggravated misdemeanor, or if the person delivers
 17 34 to a person under 18 years of age who is at least three years
 17 35 younger than the violator, the person commits a class "D"
 18  1 felony.  In addition, under current law, if a person unlawfully
 18  2 and knowingly publishes an advertisement or distributes in a
 18  3 public place a promotion for an imitation controlled substance
 18  4 the person commits a serious misdemeanor.
 18  5    The bill enhances the criminal penalties for controlled
 18  6 substances classified in Code sections 124.204(4)(ai) and
 18  7 124.204(6)(i) from an aggravated misdemeanor to a class "C"
 18  8 felony punishable pursuant to Code section 124.401(1)(c)(8).
 18  9 This change equalizes the criminal penalties with violations
 18 10 involving other schedule I controlled substances.
 18 11    The bill provides that if the same person commits two or
 18 12 more acts which are in violation of Code section 124.401(1)
 18 13 and the acts occur in the same location or time period so the
 18 14 acts are attributable to a single scheme, the acts may be
 18 15 considered a single violation and the weights of the imitation
 18 16 controlled substance may be combined for purposes of charging
 18 17 the offender.
 18 18    The amendment to Code section 124.401A provides that
 18 19 a person who is 18 years of age or older who unlawfully
 18 20 manufactures with the intent to distribute, distributes,
 18 21 or possesses with the intent to distribute an imitation
 18 22 controlled substance to another person 18 years of age or older
 18 23 within 1,000 feet of the real property comprising a public or
 18 24 nonpublic school, may be sentenced up to an additional term of
 18 25 confinement of five years in addition to any other penalty.
 18 26    The amendment to Code section 124.401B provides that
 18 27 a person who unlawfully possesses an imitation controlled
 18 28 substance within 1,000 feet of the real property comprising a
 18 29 school, public park, public pool, public recreation center, or
 18 30 marked school bus may be sentenced up to 100 hours of community
 18 31 service.
 18 32    The amendments to Code section 124.406 relate to the
 18 33 distribution or possession with the intent to distribute an
 18 34 imitation controlled substance to a person under 18 years of
 18 35 age.  A person who distributes or possesses with the intent to
 19  1 distribute an imitation controlled substance, represented to
 19  2 be a substance listed in schedule I or schedule II, to a person
 19  3 under 18 years of age commits a class "B" felony. The required
 19  4 penalty for such a violation is a minimum term of confinement
 19  5 of 10 years if the substance was distributed within 1,000
 19  6 feet of the real property comprising a public or nonpublic
 19  7 school, public park, public pool, or public recreation center.
 19  8 A person who distributes or possesses with the intent to
 19  9 distribute an imitation controlled substance, represented to be
 19 10 a substance listed in schedule III, to a person under 18 years
 19 11 of age, who is at least three years younger than the violator,
 19 12 commits a class "C" felony.  A person who distributes or
 19 13 possesses with the intent to distribute an imitation controlled
 19 14 substance, represented to be a substance listed in schedule
 19 15 IV or schedule V, to a person under 18 years of age, who is
 19 16 at least three years younger than the violator, commits an
 19 17 aggravated misdemeanor.
 19 18    The amendment to Code section 124.415 requires that a peace
 19 19 officer make a reasonable effort to identify a person under 18
 19 20 years of age discovered to be in possession of an imitation
 19 21 controlled substance, and if the person is not referred to
 19 22 juvenile court, the peace officer shall make a reasonable
 19 23 effort to notify the person's custodial parent of the
 19 24 possession unless the officer has reasonable grounds to believe
 19 25 such notification is not in the best interests of the person.
 19 26 The bill specifies that if the person is taken into custody
 19 27 the juvenile court officer shall make a reasonable effort to
 19 28 identify the school of attendance and to notify the school or
 19 29 nonpublic school of the taking into custody of the person.
 19 30    The bill creates Code section 124.417, which is similar to
 19 31 Code section 124A.5 repealed by the bill.  A person registered
 19 32 under Code section 124.302 does not violate the bill if the
 19 33 person manufactures, delivers, possesses, or possesses with the
 19 34 intent to manufacture or deliver, or acts with others to do
 19 35 such activities, if the person uses the imitation controlled
 20  1 substance for use as a placebo by a registered practitioner in
 20  2 the court of professional practice or research.
 20  3    SCHEDULE I, III, AND IV CONTROLLED SUBSTANCES.  The bill
 20  4 transfers numerous substances classified as "hallucinogenic
 20  5 substances" under schedule I and reclassifies the substances
 20  6 as "other substances" under schedule I.  By transferring the
 20  7 substances to "other substances", a person commits a class "C"
 20  8 felony under Code section 124.401(1)(c)(8) if the violation
 20  9 involves such a substance. Under current law, a person commits
 20 10 an aggravated misdemeanor under Code section 124.401(1)(d) when
 20 11 committing such violations.
 20 12    The bill adds new substances as "hallucinogenic substances"
 20 13 under schedule I.  A person commits a class "C" felony under
 20 14 Code section 124.401(1)(c)(8) if the violation involves the new
 20 15 hallucinogenic substances.
 20 16    The bill adds new substances as "stimulants" under schedule
 20 17 I.  A person commits a class "C" felony under Code section
 20 18 124.401(1)(c)(8) if the violation involves the new stimulant
 20 19 substances.
 20 20    The bill also adds new substances to the classification of
 20 21 "other substances" under schedule I.  A person commits a class
 20 22 "C" felony under Code section 124.401(1)(c)(8) for a violation
 20 23 involving the new substances.
 20 24    The bill strikes one substance classified as a
 20 25 "hallucinogenic substance" under schedule I and reclassifies
 20 26 the substance as a "stimulant" containing a synthetic cathinone
 20 27 under schedule I.  The transfer of the substance within
 20 28 schedule I also changes the criminal penalty for a violation
 20 29 involving the substance from a class "C" felony under Code
 20 30 section 124.401(1)(c)(8) to an aggravated misdemeanor under
 20 31 Code section 124.401(1)(d).  The bill also strikes a substance
 20 32 in Code section 124.204(6)(i)(3) from schedule I and does not
 20 33 reclassify the substance in any other substance schedule.
 20 34    The bill also removes numerous substances from schedule I
 20 35 which are currently classified as "stimulants" in Code section
 21  1 124.204(6)(i).
 21  2    The bill also strikes two narcotic substances from schedule
 21  3 III and adds three substances to schedule IV.  A violation
 21  4 involving a schedule IV controlled substance is punishable as

 16 15    IMITATION CONTROLLED SUBSTANCES.  Under current law
 16 16 imitation controlled substances are regulated under Code
 16 17 chapter 124A.  The bill repeals Code chapter 124A and transfers
 16 18 the regulation of imitation controlled substances to Code
 16 19 chapter 124.  The definition and designation of an imitation
 16 20 controlled substance in Code chapter 124 remains identical
 16 21 to the definition and designation of an imitation controlled
 16 22 substance under current law in Code chapter 124A.
 16 23    Under the bill and in current law, an imitation controlled
 16 24 substance means a substance which is not a controlled substance
 16 25 but by color, shape, size, markings, and other aspects of
 16 26 dosage unit appearance, and packaging or other factors, appears
 16 27 to be or resembles a controlled substance. The board of
 16 28 pharmacy may designate a substance as an imitation controlled
 16 29 substance pursuant to the board's rulemaking authority and in
 16 30 accordance with Code chapter 17A.
 16 31    In addition, under current law and in the bill, if a
 16 32 substance has not been designated as an imitation controlled
 16 33 substance by the board of pharmacy and when dosage unit
 16 34 appearance alone does not establish that a substance is an
 16 35 imitation controlled substance, the following factors may
 17  1 be considered in determining whether the substance is an
 17  2 imitation controlled substance: the substance is represented
 17  3 as having the effect of a controlled substance; the substance

 17  6 or a person receives money or other property having a value
 17  7 substantially greater than the actual value of the substance

 17  9    Under the bill, if a person unlawfully manufactures,
 17 10 delivers, or possesses with the intent to deliver an imitation
 17 11 controlled substance containing any detectable amount of those
 17 12 substances identified in Code section 124.204(9), or unlawfully
 17 13 acts with, enters into a common scheme or design with, or
 17 14 conspires with one or more persons to manufacture, deliver,

 17 18 than $1 million if the imitation controlled substance is more
 17 19 than 10 kilograms; a class "B" felony punishable by confinement

 17 31 a person unlawfully manufactures, delivers, or possesses with
 17 32 intent to deliver an imitation controlled substance, the person
 17 33 commits an aggravated misdemeanor, or if the person delivers
 17 34 to a person under 18 years of age who is at least three years

 18 33 distribution or possession with the intent to distribute an
 18 34 imitation controlled substance to a person under 18 years of

 19  1 distribute an imitation controlled substance, represented to
 19  2 be a substance listed in schedule I or schedule II, to a person
 19  3 under 18 years of age commits a class "B" felony. The required
 19  4 penalty for such a violation is a minimum term of confinement
 19  5 of 10 years if the substance was distributed within 1,000
 19  6 feet of the real property comprising a public or nonpublic
 19  7 school, public park, public pool, or public recreation center.
 19  8 A person who distributes or possesses with the intent to

 20  7 substances to "other substances", a person commits a class "C"
 20  8 felony under Code section 124.401(1)(c)(8) if the violation
 20  9 involves such a substance. Under current law, a person commits

 20 11 committing such violations.
 20 12    The bill adds new substances as "hallucinogenic substances"
 20 13 under schedule I.  A person commits a class "C" felony under

 20 15 hallucinogenic substances.
 20 16    The bill adds new substances as "stimulants" under schedule

 20 19 substances.
 20 20    The bill also adds new substances to the classification of

 20 22 "C" felony under Code section 124.401(1)(c)(8) for a violation
 20 23 involving the new substances.
 20 24    The bill strikes one substance classified as a
 20 25 "hallucinogenic substance" under schedule I and reclassifies
 20 26 the substance as a "stimulant" containing a synthetic cathinone
 20 27 under schedule I.  The transfer of the substance within
 20 28 schedule I also changes the criminal penalty for a violation
 20 29 involving the substance from a class "C" felony under Code
 20 30 section 124.401(1)(c)(8) to an aggravated misdemeanor under
 20 31 Code section 124.401(1)(d).  The bill also strikes a substance

 16  9 $5,000 but not more than $100,000 if the imitation controlled
 16 10 substance is more than 35 grams but not more than 125 grams
 16 11 rather than the current 10 to 50 grams; or a class "C" felony
 16 12 punishable by a fine of not less than $1,000 but not more than
 16 13 $50,000 if the controlled substance containing cocaine base is
 16 14 35 grams or less rather than the current 10 grams or less.
 16 15    IMITATION CONTROLLED SUBSTANCES.  Under current law
 16 16 imitation controlled substances are regulated under Code
 16 17 chapter 124A.  The bill repeals Code chapter 124A and transfers
 16 18 the regulation of imitation controlled substances to Code
 16 19 chapter 124.  The definition and designation of an imitation
 16 20 controlled substance in Code chapter 124 remains identical
 16 21 to the definition and designation of an imitation controlled
 16 22 substance under current law in Code chapter 124A.
 16 23    Under the bill and in current law, an imitation controlled
 16 24 substance means a substance which is not a controlled substance
 16 25 but by color, shape, size, markings, and other aspects of
 16 26 dosage unit appearance, and packaging or other factors, appears
 16 27 to be or resembles a controlled substance. The board of
 16 28 pharmacy may designate a substance as an imitation controlled
 16 29 substance pursuant to the board's rulemaking authority and in
 16 30 accordance with Code chapter 17A.
 16 31    In addition, under current law and in the bill, if a
 16 32 substance has not been designated as an imitation controlled
 16 33 substance by the board of pharmacy and when dosage unit
 16 34 appearance alone does not establish that a substance is an
 16 35 imitation controlled substance, the following factors may
 17  1 be considered in determining whether the substance is an
 17  2 imitation controlled substance: the substance is represented
 17  3 as having the effect of a controlled substance; the substance
 17  4 is represented as a controlled substance or as a substitute for
 17  5 a controlled substance because of its nature or appearance;
 17  6 or a person receives money or other property having a value
 17  7 substantially greater than the actual value of the substance
 17  8 when sold.
 17  9    Under the bill, if a person unlawfully manufactures,
 17 10 delivers, or possesses with the intent to deliver an imitation
 17 11 controlled substance containing any detectable amount of those
 17 12 substances identified in Code section 124.204(9), or unlawfully
 17 13 acts with, enters into a common scheme or design with, or
 17 14 conspires with one or more persons to manufacture, deliver,
 17 15 or possess such imitation controlled substances, the person
 17 16 commits the following offense: a class "B" felony punishable
 17 17 by confinement of no more than 50 years and a fine of not more
 17 18 than $1 million if the imitation controlled substance is more
 17 19 than 10 kilograms; a class "B" felony punishable by confinement
 17 20 of no more than 25 years and a fine of not less than $5,000 but
 17 21 not more than $100,000 if the imitation controlled substance
 17 22 is more than five kilograms but not more than 10 kilograms; a
 17 23 class "C" felony punishable by a fine of not less than $1,000
 17 24 but not more than $50,000 if the imitation controlled substance
 17 25 is five kilograms or less; or an aggravated misdemeanor if the
 17 26 imitation controlled substance is classified in schedule IV or
 17 27 V; or a serious misdemeanor for a first possession offense,
 17 28 an aggravated misdemeanor for a second possession offense,
 17 29 or a class "D" felony for two or more previous possession
 17 30 offenses. Current law in Code section 124A.4 provides that if
 17 31 a person unlawfully manufactures, delivers, or possesses with
 17 32 intent to deliver an imitation controlled substance, the person
 17 33 commits an aggravated misdemeanor, or if the person delivers
 17 34 to a person under 18 years of age who is at least three years
 17 35 younger than the violator, the person commits a class "D"
 18  1 felony.  In addition, under current law, if a person unlawfully
 18  2 and knowingly publishes an advertisement or distributes in a
 18  3 public place a promotion for an imitation controlled substance
 18  4 the person commits a serious misdemeanor.
 18  5    The bill enhances the criminal penalties for controlled
 18  6 substances classified in Code sections 124.204(4)(ai) and
 18  7 124.204(6)(i) from an aggravated misdemeanor to a class "C"
 18  8 felony punishable pursuant to Code section 124.401(1)(c)(8).
 18  9 This change equalizes the criminal penalties with violations
 18 10 involving other schedule I controlled substances.
 18 11    The bill provides that if the same person commits two or
 18 12 more acts which are in violation of Code section 124.401(1)
 18 13 and the acts occur in the same location or time period so the
 18 14 acts are attributable to a single scheme, the acts may be
 18 15 considered a single violation and the weights of the imitation
 18 16 controlled substance may be combined for purposes of charging
 18 17 the offender.
 18 18    The amendment to Code section 124.401A provides that
 18 19 a person who is 18 years of age or older who unlawfully
 18 20 manufactures with the intent to distribute, distributes,
 18 21 or possesses with the intent to distribute an imitation
 18 22 controlled substance to another person 18 years of age or older
 18 23 within 1,000 feet of the real property comprising a public or
 18 24 nonpublic school, may be sentenced up to an additional term of
 18 25 confinement of five years in addition to any other penalty.
 18 26    The amendment to Code section 124.401B provides that
 18 27 a person who unlawfully possesses an imitation controlled
 18 28 substance within 1,000 feet of the real property comprising a
 18 29 school, public park, public pool, public recreation center, or
 18 30 marked school bus may be sentenced up to 100 hours of community
 18 31 service.
 18 32    The amendments to Code section 124.406 relate to the
 18 33 distribution or possession with the intent to distribute an
 18 34 imitation controlled substance to a person under 18 years of
 18 35 age.  A person who distributes or possesses with the intent to
 19  1 distribute an imitation controlled substance, represented to
 19  2 be a substance listed in schedule I or schedule II, to a person
 19  3 under 18 years of age commits a class "B" felony. The required
 19  4 penalty for such a violation is a minimum term of confinement
 19  5 of 10 years if the substance was distributed within 1,000
 19  6 feet of the real property comprising a public or nonpublic
 19  7 school, public park, public pool, or public recreation center.
 19  8 A person who distributes or possesses with the intent to
 19  9 distribute an imitation controlled substance, represented to be
 19 10 a substance listed in schedule III, to a person under 18 years
 19 11 of age, who is at least three years younger than the violator,
 19 12 commits a class "C" felony.  A person who distributes or
 19 13 possesses with the intent to distribute an imitation controlled
 19 14 substance, represented to be a substance listed in schedule
 19 15 IV or schedule V, to a person under 18 years of age, who is
 19 16 at least three years younger than the violator, commits an
 19 17 aggravated misdemeanor.
 19 18    The amendment to Code section 124.415 requires that a peace
 19 19 officer make a reasonable effort to identify a person under 18
 19 20 years of age discovered to be in possession of an imitation
 19 21 controlled substance, and if the person is not referred to
 19 22 juvenile court, the peace officer shall make a reasonable
 19 23 effort to notify the person's custodial parent of the
 19 24 possession unless the officer has reasonable grounds to believe
 19 25 such notification is not in the best interests of the person.
 19 26 The bill specifies that if the person is taken into custody
 19 27 the juvenile court officer shall make a reasonable effort to
 19 28 identify the school of attendance and to notify the school or
 19 29 nonpublic school of the taking into custody of the person.
 19 30    The bill creates Code section 124.417, which is similar to
 19 31 Code section 124A.5 repealed by the bill.  A person registered
 19 32 under Code section 124.302 does not violate the bill if the
 19 33 person manufactures, delivers, possesses, or possesses with the
 19 34 intent to manufacture or deliver, or acts with others to do
 19 35 such activities, if the person uses the imitation controlled
 20  1 substance for use as a placebo by a registered practitioner in
 20  2 the court of professional practice or research.
 20  3    SCHEDULE I, III, AND IV CONTROLLED SUBSTANCES.  The bill
 20  4 transfers numerous substances classified as "hallucinogenic
 20  5 substances" under schedule I and reclassifies the substances
 20  6 as "other substances" under schedule I.  By transferring the
 20  7 substances to "other substances", a person commits a class "C"
 20  8 felony under Code section 124.401(1)(c)(8) if the violation
 20  9 involves such a substance. Under current law, a person commits
 20 10 an aggravated misdemeanor under Code section 124.401(1)(d) when
 20 11 committing such violations.
 20 12    The bill adds new substances as "hallucinogenic substances"
 20 13 under schedule I.  A person commits a class "C" felony under
 20 14 Code section 124.401(1)(c)(8) if the violation involves the new
 20 15 hallucinogenic substances.
 20 16    The bill adds new substances as "stimulants" under schedule
 20 17 I.  A person commits a class "C" felony under Code section
 20 18 124.401(1)(c)(8) if the violation involves the new stimulant
 20 19 substances.
 20 20    The bill also adds new substances to the classification of
 20 21 "other substances" under schedule I.  A person commits a class
 20 22 "C" felony under Code section 124.401(1)(c)(8) for a violation
 20 23 involving the new substances.
 20 24    The bill strikes one substance classified as a
 20 25 "hallucinogenic substance" under schedule I and reclassifies
 20 26 the substance as a "stimulant" containing a synthetic cathinone
 20 27 under schedule I.  The transfer of the substance within
 20 28 schedule I also changes the criminal penalty for a violation
 20 29 involving the substance from a class "C" felony under Code
 20 30 section 124.401(1)(c)(8) to an aggravated misdemeanor under
 20 31 Code section 124.401(1)(d).  The bill also strikes a substance
 20 32 in Code section 124.204(6)(i)(3) from schedule I and does not
 20 33 reclassify the substance in any other substance schedule.
 20 34    The bill also removes numerous substances from schedule I
 20 35 which are currently classified as "stimulants" in Code section
 21  1 124.204(6)(i).
 21  2    The bill also strikes two narcotic substances from schedule
 21  3 III and adds three substances to schedule IV.  A violation
 21  4 involving a schedule IV controlled substance is punishable as
 21  5 an aggravated misdemeanor in Code section 124.401(1)(d).

 16 15    IMITATION CONTROLLED SUBSTANCES.  Under current law
 16 16 imitation controlled substances are regulated under Code
 16 17 chapter 124A.  The bill repeals Code chapter 124A and transfers

 16 20 controlled substance in Code chapter 124 remains identical
 16 21 to the definition and designation of an imitation controlled
 16 22 substance under current law in Code chapter 124A.

 16 28 pharmacy may designate a substance as an imitation controlled
 16 29 substance pursuant to the board's rulemaking authority and in
 16 30 accordance with Code chapter 17A.
 16 31    In addition, under current law and in the bill, if a
 16 32 substance has not been designated as an imitation controlled
 16 33 substance by the board of pharmacy and when dosage unit
 16 34 appearance alone does not establish that a substance is an
 16 35 imitation controlled substance, the following factors may
 17  1 be considered in determining whether the substance is an
 17  2 imitation controlled substance: the substance is represented
 17  3 as having the effect of a controlled substance; the substance
 17  4 is represented as a controlled substance or as a substitute for

 17 11 controlled substance containing any detectable amount of those
 17 12 substances identified in Code section 124.204(9), or unlawfully

 17 16 commits the following offense: a class "B" felony punishable
 17 17 by confinement of no more than 50 years and a fine of not more
 17 18 than $1 million if the imitation controlled substance is more
 17 19 than 10 kilograms; a class "B" felony punishable by confinement

 18  5    The bill enhances the criminal penalties for controlled

 19  6 feet of the real property comprising a public or nonpublic

 20 28 schedule I also changes the criminal penalty for a violation
 20 29 involving the substance from a class "C" felony under Code
 20 30 section 124.401(1)(c)(8) to an aggravated misdemeanor under

 17 21 not more than $100,000 if the imitation controlled substance
 17 22 is more than five kilograms but not more than 10 kilograms; a
 17 23 class "C" felony punishable by a fine of not less than $1,000
 17 24 but not more than $50,000 if the imitation controlled substance
 17 25 is five kilograms or less; or an aggravated misdemeanor if the
 17 26 imitation controlled substance is classified in schedule IV or
 17 27 V; or a serious misdemeanor for a first possession offense,
 17 28 an aggravated misdemeanor for a second possession offense,
 17 29 or a class "D" felony for two or more previous possession
 17 30 offenses. Current law in Code section 124A.4 provides that if
 17 31 a person unlawfully manufactures, delivers, or possesses with
 17 32 intent to deliver an imitation controlled substance, the person
 17 33 commits an aggravated misdemeanor, or if the person delivers
 17 34 to a person under 18 years of age who is at least three years
 17 35 younger than the violator, the person commits a class "D"
 18  1 felony.  In addition, under current law, if a person unlawfully
 18  2 and knowingly publishes an advertisement or distributes in a
 18  3 public place a promotion for an imitation controlled substance
 18  4 the person commits a serious misdemeanor.
 18  5    The bill enhances the criminal penalties for controlled
 18  6 substances classified in Code sections 124.204(4)(ai) and
 18  7 124.204(6)(i) from an aggravated misdemeanor to a class "C"
 18  8 felony punishable pursuant to Code section 124.401(1)(c)(8).
 18  9 This change equalizes the criminal penalties with violations
 18 10 involving other schedule I controlled substances.
 18 11    The bill provides that if the same person commits two or
 18 12 more acts which are in violation of Code section 124.401(1)
 18 13 and the acts occur in the same location or time period so the
 18 14 acts are attributable to a single scheme, the acts may be
 18 15 considered a single violation and the weights of the imitation
 18 16 controlled substance may be combined for purposes of charging
 18 17 the offender.
 18 18    The amendment to Code section 124.401A provides that
 18 19 a person who is 18 years of age or older who unlawfully
 18 20 manufactures with the intent to distribute, distributes,
 18 21 or possesses with the intent to distribute an imitation
 18 22 controlled substance to another person 18 years of age or older
 18 23 within 1,000 feet of the real property comprising a public or
 18 24 nonpublic school, may be sentenced up to an additional term of
 18 25 confinement of five years in addition to any other penalty.
 18 26    The amendment to Code section 124.401B provides that
 18 27 a person who unlawfully possesses an imitation controlled
 18 28 substance within 1,000 feet of the real property comprising a
 18 29 school, public park, public pool, public recreation center, or
 18 30 marked school bus may be sentenced up to 100 hours of community
 18 31 service.
 18 32    The amendments to Code section 124.406 relate to the
 18 33 distribution or possession with the intent to distribute an
 18 34 imitation controlled substance to a person under 18 years of
 18 35 age.  A person who distributes or possesses with the intent to
 19  1 distribute an imitation controlled substance, represented to
 19  2 be a substance listed in schedule I or schedule II, to a person
 19  3 under 18 years of age commits a class "B" felony. The required
 19  4 penalty for such a violation is a minimum term of confinement
 19  5 of 10 years if the substance was distributed within 1,000
 19  6 feet of the real property comprising a public or nonpublic
 19  7 school, public park, public pool, or public recreation center.
 19  8 A person who distributes or possesses with the intent to
 19  9 distribute an imitation controlled substance, represented to be
 19 10 a substance listed in schedule III, to a person under 18 years
 19 11 of age, who is at least three years younger than the violator,
 19 12 commits a class "C" felony.  A person who distributes or
 19 13 possesses with the intent to distribute an imitation controlled
 19 14 substance, represented to be a substance listed in schedule
 19 15 IV or schedule V, to a person under 18 years of age, who is
 19 16 at least three years younger than the violator, commits an
 19 17 aggravated misdemeanor.
 19 18    The amendment to Code section 124.415 requires that a peace
 19 19 officer make a reasonable effort to identify a person under 18
 19 20 years of age discovered to be in possession of an imitation
 19 21 controlled substance, and if the person is not referred to
 19 22 juvenile court, the peace officer shall make a reasonable
 19 23 effort to notify the person's custodial parent of the
 19 24 possession unless the officer has reasonable grounds to believe
 19 25 such notification is not in the best interests of the person.
 19 26 The bill specifies that if the person is taken into custody
 19 27 the juvenile court officer shall make a reasonable effort to
 19 28 identify the school of attendance and to notify the school or
 19 29 nonpublic school of the taking into custody of the person.
 19 30    The bill creates Code section 124.417, which is similar to
 19 31 Code section 124A.5 repealed by the bill.  A person registered
 19 32 under Code section 124.302 does not violate the bill if the
 19 33 person manufactures, delivers, possesses, or possesses with the
 19 34 intent to manufacture or deliver, or acts with others to do
 19 35 such activities, if the person uses the imitation controlled
 20  1 substance for use as a placebo by a registered practitioner in
 20  2 the court of professional practice or research.
 20  3    SCHEDULE I, III, AND IV CONTROLLED SUBSTANCES.  The bill
 20  4 transfers numerous substances classified as "hallucinogenic
 20  5 substances" under schedule I and reclassifies the substances
 20  6 as "other substances" under schedule I.  By transferring the
 20  7 substances to "other substances", a person commits a class "C"
 20  8 felony under Code section 124.401(1)(c)(8) if the violation
 20  9 involves such a substance. Under current law, a person commits
 20 10 an aggravated misdemeanor under Code section 124.401(1)(d) when
 20 11 committing such violations.
 20 12    The bill adds new substances as "hallucinogenic substances"
 20 13 under schedule I.  A person commits a class "C" felony under
 20 14 Code section 124.401(1)(c)(8) if the violation involves the new
 20 15 hallucinogenic substances.
 20 16    The bill adds new substances as "stimulants" under schedule
 20 17 I.  A person commits a class "C" felony under Code section
 20 18 124.401(1)(c)(8) if the violation involves the new stimulant
 20 19 substances.
 20 20    The bill also adds new substances to the classification of
 20 21 "other substances" under schedule I.  A person commits a class
 20 22 "C" felony under Code section 124.401(1)(c)(8) for a violation
 20 23 involving the new substances.
 20 24    The bill strikes one substance classified as a
 20 25 "hallucinogenic substance" under schedule I and reclassifies
 20 26 the substance as a "stimulant" containing a synthetic cathinone
 20 27 under schedule I.  The transfer of the substance within
 20 28 schedule I also changes the criminal penalty for a violation
 20 29 involving the substance from a class "C" felony under Code
 20 30 section 124.401(1)(c)(8) to an aggravated misdemeanor under
 20 31 Code section 124.401(1)(d).  The bill also strikes a substance
 20 32 in Code section 124.204(6)(i)(3) from schedule I and does not
 20 33 reclassify the substance in any other substance schedule.
 20 34    The bill also removes numerous substances from schedule I
 20 35 which are currently classified as "stimulants" in Code section
 21  1 124.204(6)(i).
 21  2    The bill also strikes two narcotic substances from schedule
 21  3 III and adds three substances to schedule IV.  A violation
 21  4 involving a schedule IV controlled substance is punishable as
 21  5 an aggravated misdemeanor in Code section 124.401(1)(d).

 16 11 rather than the current 10 to 50 grams; or a class "C" felony
 16 12 punishable by a fine of not less than $1,000 but not more than
 16 13 $50,000 if the controlled substance containing cocaine base is
 16 14 35 grams or less rather than the current 10 grams or less.
 16 15    IMITATION CONTROLLED SUBSTANCES.  Under current law
 16 16 imitation controlled substances are regulated under Code
 16 17 chapter 124A.  The bill repeals Code chapter 124A and transfers
 16 18 the regulation of imitation controlled substances to Code
 16 19 chapter 124.  The definition and designation of an imitation
 16 20 controlled substance in Code chapter 124 remains identical
 16 21 to the definition and designation of an imitation controlled
 16 22 substance under current law in Code chapter 124A.
 16 23    Under the bill and in current law, an imitation controlled
 16 24 substance means a substance which is not a controlled substance
 16 25 but by color, shape, size, markings, and other aspects of
 16 26 dosage unit appearance, and packaging or other factors, appears
 16 27 to be or resembles a controlled substance. The board of
 16 28 pharmacy may designate a substance as an imitation controlled
 16 29 substance pursuant to the board's rulemaking authority and in
 16 30 accordance with Code chapter 17A.
 16 31    In addition, under current law and in the bill, if a
 16 32 substance has not been designated as an imitation controlled
 16 33 substance by the board of pharmacy and when dosage unit
 16 34 appearance alone does not establish that a substance is an
 16 35 imitation controlled substance, the following factors may
 17  1 be considered in determining whether the substance is an
 17  2 imitation controlled substance: the substance is represented
 17  3 as having the effect of a controlled substance; the substance
 17  4 is represented as a controlled substance or as a substitute for
 17  5 a controlled substance because of its nature or appearance;
 17  6 or a person receives money or other property having a value
 17  7 substantially greater than the actual value of the substance
 17  8 when sold.
 17  9    Under the bill, if a person unlawfully manufactures,
 17 10 delivers, or possesses with the intent to deliver an imitation
 17 11 controlled substance containing any detectable amount of those
 17 12 substances identified in Code section 124.204(9), or unlawfully
 17 13 acts with, enters into a common scheme or design with, or
 17 14 conspires with one or more persons to manufacture, deliver,
 17 15 or possess such imitation controlled substances, the person
 17 16 commits the following offense: a class "B" felony punishable
 17 17 by confinement of no more than 50 years and a fine of not more
 17 18 than $1 million if the imitation controlled substance is more
 17 19 than 10 kilograms; a class "B" felony punishable by confinement
 17 20 of no more than 25 years and a fine of not less than $5,000 but
 17 21 not more than $100,000 if the imitation controlled substance
 17 22 is more than five kilograms but not more than 10 kilograms; a
 17 23 class "C" felony punishable by a fine of not less than $1,000
 17 24 but not more than $50,000 if the imitation controlled substance
 17 25 is five kilograms or less; or an aggravated misdemeanor if the
 17 26 imitation controlled substance is classified in schedule IV or
 17 27 V; or a serious misdemeanor for a first possession offense,
 17 28 an aggravated misdemeanor for a second possession offense,
 17 29 or a class "D" felony for two or more previous possession
 17 30 offenses. Current law in Code section 124A.4 provides that if
 17 31 a person unlawfully manufactures, delivers, or possesses with
 17 32 intent to deliver an imitation controlled substance, the person
 17 33 commits an aggravated misdemeanor, or if the person delivers
 17 34 to a person under 18 years of age who is at least three years
 17 35 younger than the violator, the person commits a class "D"
 18  1 felony.  In addition, under current law, if a person unlawfully
 18  2 and knowingly publishes an advertisement or distributes in a
 18  3 public place a promotion for an imitation controlled substance
 18  4 the person commits a serious misdemeanor.
 18  5    The bill enhances the criminal penalties for controlled
 18  6 substances classified in Code sections 124.204(4)(ai) and
 18  7 124.204(6)(i) from an aggravated misdemeanor to a class "C"
 18  8 felony punishable pursuant to Code section 124.401(1)(c)(8).
 18  9 This change equalizes the criminal penalties with violations
 18 10 involving other schedule I controlled substances.
 18 11    The bill provides that if the same person commits two or
 18 12 more acts which are in violation of Code section 124.401(1)
 18 13 and the acts occur in the same location or time period so the
 18 14 acts are attributable to a single scheme, the acts may be
 18 15 considered a single violation and the weights of the imitation
 18 16 controlled substance may be combined for purposes of charging
 18 17 the offender.
 18 18    The amendment to Code section 124.401A provides that
 18 19 a person who is 18 years of age or older who unlawfully
 18 20 manufactures with the intent to distribute, distributes,
 18 21 or possesses with the intent to distribute an imitation
 18 22 controlled substance to another person 18 years of age or older
 18 23 within 1,000 feet of the real property comprising a public or
 18 24 nonpublic school, may be sentenced up to an additional term of
 18 25 confinement of five years in addition to any other penalty.
 18 26    The amendment to Code section 124.401B provides that
 18 27 a person who unlawfully possesses an imitation controlled
 18 28 substance within 1,000 feet of the real property comprising a
 18 29 school, public park, public pool, public recreation center, or
 18 30 marked school bus may be sentenced up to 100 hours of community
 18 31 service.
 18 32    The amendments to Code section 124.406 relate to the
 18 33 distribution or possession with the intent to distribute an
 18 34 imitation controlled substance to a person under 18 years of
 18 35 age.  A person who distributes or possesses with the intent to
 19  1 distribute an imitation controlled substance, represented to
 19  2 be a substance listed in schedule I or schedule II, to a person
 19  3 under 18 years of age commits a class "B" felony. The required
 19  4 penalty for such a violation is a minimum term of confinement
 19  5 of 10 years if the substance was distributed within 1,000
 19  6 feet of the real property comprising a public or nonpublic
 19  7 school, public park, public pool, or public recreation center.
 19  8 A person who distributes or possesses with the intent to
 19  9 distribute an imitation controlled substance, represented to be
 19 10 a substance listed in schedule III, to a person under 18 years
 19 11 of age, who is at least three years younger than the violator,
 19 12 commits a class "C" felony.  A person who distributes or
 19 13 possesses with the intent to distribute an imitation controlled
 19 14 substance, represented to be a substance listed in schedule
 19 15 IV or schedule V, to a person under 18 years of age, who is
 19 16 at least three years younger than the violator, commits an
 19 17 aggravated misdemeanor.
 19 18    The amendment to Code section 124.415 requires that a peace
 19 19 officer make a reasonable effort to identify a person under 18
 19 20 years of age discovered to be in possession of an imitation
 19 21 controlled substance, and if the person is not referred to
 19 22 juvenile court, the peace officer shall make a reasonable
 19 23 effort to notify the person's custodial parent of the
 19 24 possession unless the officer has reasonable grounds to believe
 19 25 such notification is not in the best interests of the person.
 19 26 The bill specifies that if the person is taken into custody
 19 27 the juvenile court officer shall make a reasonable effort to
 19 28 identify the school of attendance and to notify the school or
 19 29 nonpublic school of the taking into custody of the person.
 19 30    The bill creates Code section 124.417, which is similar to
 19 31 Code section 124A.5 repealed by the bill.  A person registered
 19 32 under Code section 124.302 does not violate the bill if the
 19 33 person manufactures, delivers, possesses, or possesses with the
 19 34 intent to manufacture or deliver, or acts with others to do
 19 35 such activities, if the person uses the imitation controlled
 20  1 substance for use as a placebo by a registered practitioner in
 20  2 the court of professional practice or research.
 20  3    SCHEDULE I, III, AND IV CONTROLLED SUBSTANCES.  The bill
 20  4 transfers numerous substances classified as "hallucinogenic
 20  5 substances" under schedule I and reclassifies the substances
 20  6 as "other substances" under schedule I.  By transferring the
 20  7 substances to "other substances", a person commits a class "C"
 20  8 felony under Code section 124.401(1)(c)(8) if the violation
 20  9 involves such a substance. Under current law, a person commits
 20 10 an aggravated misdemeanor under Code section 124.401(1)(d) when
 20 11 committing such violations.
 20 12    The bill adds new substances as "hallucinogenic substances"
 20 13 under schedule I.  A person commits a class "C" felony under
 20 14 Code section 124.401(1)(c)(8) if the violation involves the new
 20 15 hallucinogenic substances.
 20 16    The bill adds new substances as "stimulants" under schedule
 20 17 I.  A person commits a class "C" felony under Code section
 20 18 124.401(1)(c)(8) if the violation involves the new stimulant
 20 19 substances.
 20 20    The bill also adds new substances to the classification of
 20 21 "other substances" under schedule I.  A person commits a class
 20 22 "C" felony under Code section 124.401(1)(c)(8) for a violation
 20 23 involving the new substances.
 20 24    The bill strikes one substance classified as a
 20 25 "hallucinogenic substance" under schedule I and reclassifies
 20 26 the substance as a "stimulant" containing a synthetic cathinone
 20 27 under schedule I.  The transfer of the substance within
 20 28 schedule I also changes the criminal penalty for a violation
 20 29 involving the substance from a class "C" felony under Code
 20 30 section 124.401(1)(c)(8) to an aggravated misdemeanor under
 20 31 Code section 124.401(1)(d).  The bill also strikes a substance
 20 32 in Code section 124.204(6)(i)(3) from schedule I and does not
 20 33 reclassify the substance in any other substance schedule.
 20 34    The bill also removes numerous substances from schedule I
 20 35 which are currently classified as "stimulants" in Code section
 21  1 124.204(6)(i).
 21  2    The bill also strikes two narcotic substances from schedule
 21  3 III and adds three substances to schedule IV.  A violation
 21  4 involving a schedule IV controlled substance is punishable as

 16 15    IMITATION CONTROLLED SUBSTANCES.  Under current law
 16 16 imitation controlled substances are regulated under Code
 16 17 chapter 124A.  The bill repeals Code chapter 124A and transfers
 16 18 the regulation of imitation controlled substances to Code
 16 19 chapter 124.  The definition and designation of an imitation
 16 20 controlled substance in Code chapter 124 remains identical
 16 21 to the definition and designation of an imitation controlled
 16 22 substance under current law in Code chapter 124A.
 16 23    Under the bill and in current law, an imitation controlled

 16 25 but by color, shape, size, markings, and other aspects of

 16 31    In addition, under current law and in the bill, if a
 16 32 substance has not been designated as an imitation controlled
 16 33 substance by the board of pharmacy and when dosage unit
 16 34 appearance alone does not establish that a substance is an
 16 35 imitation controlled substance, the following factors may
 17  1 be considered in determining whether the substance is an
 17  2 imitation controlled substance: the substance is represented
 17  3 as having the effect of a controlled substance; the substance
 17  4 is represented as a controlled substance or as a substitute for

 17  6 or a person receives money or other property having a value
 17  7 substantially greater than the actual value of the substance
 17  8 when sold.
 17  9    Under the bill, if a person unlawfully manufactures,
 17 10 delivers, or possesses with the intent to deliver an imitation
 17 11 controlled substance containing any detectable amount of those
 17 12 substances identified in Code section 124.204(9), or unlawfully
 17 13 acts with, enters into a common scheme or design with, or
 17 14 conspires with one or more persons to manufacture, deliver,
 17 15 or possess such imitation controlled substances, the person
 17 16 commits the following offense: a class "B" felony punishable
 17 17 by confinement of no more than 50 years and a fine of not more
 17 18 than $1 million if the imitation controlled substance is more
 17 19 than 10 kilograms; a class "B" felony punishable by confinement

 17 28 an aggravated misdemeanor for a second possession offense,
 17 29 or a class "D" felony for two or more previous possession
 17 30 offenses. Current law in Code section 124A.4 provides that if
 17 31 a person unlawfully manufactures, delivers, or possesses with
 17 32 intent to deliver an imitation controlled substance, the person
 17 33 commits an aggravated misdemeanor, or if the person delivers
 17 34 to a person under 18 years of age who is at least three years
 17 35 younger than the violator, the person commits a class "D"

 18  2 and knowingly publishes an advertisement or distributes in a
 18  3 public place a promotion for an imitation controlled substance
 18  4 the person commits a serious misdemeanor.
 18  5    The bill enhances the criminal penalties for controlled
 18  6 substances classified in Code sections 124.204(4)(ai) and
 18  7 124.204(6)(i) from an aggravated misdemeanor to a class "C"
 18  8 felony punishable pursuant to Code section 124.401(1)(c)(8).

 18 14 acts are attributable to a single scheme, the acts may be
 18 15 considered a single violation and the weights of the imitation
 18 16 controlled substance may be combined for purposes of charging
 18 17 the offender.
 18 18    The amendment to Code section 124.401A provides that
 18 19 a person who is 18 years of age or older who unlawfully
 18 20 manufactures with the intent to distribute, distributes,

 19  2 be a substance listed in schedule I or schedule II, to a person
 19  3 under 18 years of age commits a class "B" felony. The required
 19  4 penalty for such a violation is a minimum term of confinement
 19  5 of 10 years if the substance was distributed within 1,000
 19  6 feet of the real property comprising a public or nonpublic
 19  7 school, public park, public pool, or public recreation center.
 19  8 A person who distributes or possesses with the intent to
 19  9 distribute an imitation controlled substance, represented to be
 19 10 a substance listed in schedule III, to a person under 18 years
 19 11 of age, who is at least three years younger than the violator,
 19 12 commits a class "C" felony.  A person who distributes or
 19 13 possesses with the intent to distribute an imitation controlled
 19 14 substance, represented to be a substance listed in schedule
 19 15 IV or schedule V, to a person under 18 years of age, who is
 19 16 at least three years younger than the violator, commits an
 19 17 aggravated misdemeanor.
 19 18    The amendment to Code section 124.415 requires that a peace
 19 19 officer make a reasonable effort to identify a person under 18
 19 20 years of age discovered to be in possession of an imitation
 19 21 controlled substance, and if the person is not referred to
 19 22 juvenile court, the peace officer shall make a reasonable
 19 23 effort to notify the person's custodial parent of the
 19 24 possession unless the officer has reasonable grounds to believe
 19 25 such notification is not in the best interests of the person.
 19 26 The bill specifies that if the person is taken into custody
 19 27 the juvenile court officer shall make a reasonable effort to
 19 28 identify the school of attendance and to notify the school or
 19 29 nonpublic school of the taking into custody of the person.
 19 30    The bill creates Code section 124.417, which is similar to
 19 31 Code section 124A.5 repealed by the bill.  A person registered
 19 32 under Code section 124.302 does not violate the bill if the
 19 33 person manufactures, delivers, possesses, or possesses with the
 19 34 intent to manufacture or deliver, or acts with others to do
 19 35 such activities, if the person uses the imitation controlled
 20  1 substance for use as a placebo by a registered practitioner in
 20  2 the court of professional practice or research.
 20  3    SCHEDULE I, III, AND IV CONTROLLED SUBSTANCES.  The bill
 20  4 transfers numerous substances classified as "hallucinogenic
 20  5 substances" under schedule I and reclassifies the substances
 20  6 as "other substances" under schedule I.  By transferring the
 20  7 substances to "other substances", a person commits a class "C"
 20  8 felony under Code section 124.401(1)(c)(8) if the violation
 20  9 involves such a substance. Under current law, a person commits
 20 10 an aggravated misdemeanor under Code section 124.401(1)(d) when
 20 11 committing such violations.
 20 12    The bill adds new substances as "hallucinogenic substances"
 20 13 under schedule I.  A person commits a class "C" felony under
 20 14 Code section 124.401(1)(c)(8) if the violation involves the new
 20 15 hallucinogenic substances.
 20 16    The bill adds new substances as "stimulants" under schedule
 20 17 I.  A person commits a class "C" felony under Code section
 20 18 124.401(1)(c)(8) if the violation involves the new stimulant
 20 19 substances.
 20 20    The bill also adds new substances to the classification of
 20 21 "other substances" under schedule I.  A person commits a class
 20 22 "C" felony under Code section 124.401(1)(c)(8) for a violation
 20 23 involving the new substances.
 20 24    The bill strikes one substance classified as a
 20 25 "hallucinogenic substance" under schedule I and reclassifies
 20 26 the substance as a "stimulant" containing a synthetic cathinone
 20 27 under schedule I.  The transfer of the substance within
 20 28 schedule I also changes the criminal penalty for a violation
 20 29 involving the substance from a class "C" felony under Code
 20 30 section 124.401(1)(c)(8) to an aggravated misdemeanor under
 20 31 Code section 124.401(1)(d).  The bill also strikes a substance
 20 32 in Code section 124.204(6)(i)(3) from schedule I and does not
 20 33 reclassify the substance in any other substance schedule.
 20 34    The bill also removes numerous substances from schedule I
 20 35 which are currently classified as "stimulants" in Code section
 21  1 124.204(6)(i).
 21  2    The bill also strikes two narcotic substances from schedule
 21  3 III and adds three substances to schedule IV.  A violation
 21  4 involving a schedule IV controlled substance is punishable as
 21  5 an aggravated misdemeanor in Code section 124.401(1)(d).

 16 13 $50,000 if the controlled substance containing cocaine base is
 16 14 35 grams or less rather than the current 10 grams or less.
 16 15    IMITATION CONTROLLED SUBSTANCES.  Under current law
 16 16 imitation controlled substances are regulated under Code
 16 17 chapter 124A.  The bill repeals Code chapter 124A and transfers
 16 18 the regulation of imitation controlled substances to Code
 16 19 chapter 124.  The definition and designation of an imitation
 16 20 controlled substance in Code chapter 124 remains identical
 16 21 to the definition and designation of an imitation controlled
 16 22 substance under current law in Code chapter 124A.
 16 23    Under the bill and in current law, an imitation controlled
 16 24 substance means a substance which is not a controlled substance
 16 25 but by color, shape, size, markings, and other aspects of
 16 26 dosage unit appearance, and packaging or other factors, appears
 16 27 to be or resembles a controlled substance. The board of
 16 28 pharmacy may designate a substance as an imitation controlled
 16 29 substance pursuant to the board's rulemaking authority and in
 16 30 accordance with Code chapter 17A.
 16 31    In addition, under current law and in the bill, if a
 16 32 substance has not been designated as an imitation controlled
 16 33 substance by the board of pharmacy and when dosage unit
 16 34 appearance alone does not establish that a substance is an
 16 35 imitation controlled substance, the following factors may
 17  1 be considered in determining whether the substance is an
 17  2 imitation controlled substance: the substance is represented
 17  3 as having the effect of a controlled substance; the substance
 17  4 is represented as a controlled substance or as a substitute for
 17  5 a controlled substance because of its nature or appearance;
 17  6 or a person receives money or other property having a value
 17  7 substantially greater than the actual value of the substance
 17  8 when sold.
 17  9    Under the bill, if a person unlawfully manufactures,
 17 10 delivers, or possesses with the intent to deliver an imitation
 17 11 controlled substance containing any detectable amount of those
 17 12 substances identified in Code section 124.204(9), or unlawfully
 17 13 acts with, enters into a common scheme or design with, or
 17 14 conspires with one or more persons to manufacture, deliver,
 17 15 or possess such imitation controlled substances, the person
 17 16 commits the following offense: a class "B" felony punishable
 17 17 by confinement of no more than 50 years and a fine of not more
 17 18 than $1 million if the imitation controlled substance is more
 17 19 than 10 kilograms; a class "B" felony punishable by confinement
 17 20 of no more than 25 years and a fine of not less than $5,000 but
 17 21 not more than $100,000 if the imitation controlled substance
 17 22 is more than five kilograms but not more than 10 kilograms; a
 17 23 class "C" felony punishable by a fine of not less than $1,000
 17 24 but not more than $50,000 if the imitation controlled substance
 17 25 is five kilograms or less; or an aggravated misdemeanor if the
 17 26 imitation controlled substance is classified in schedule IV or
 17 27 V; or a serious misdemeanor for a first possession offense,
 17 28 an aggravated misdemeanor for a second possession offense,
 17 29 or a class "D" felony for two or more previous possession
 17 30 offenses. Current law in Code section 124A.4 provides that if
 17 31 a person unlawfully manufactures, delivers, or possesses with
 17 32 intent to deliver an imitation controlled substance, the person
 17 33 commits an aggravated misdemeanor, or if the person delivers
 17 34 to a person under 18 years of age who is at least three years
 17 35 younger than the violator, the person commits a class "D"
 18  1 felony.  In addition, under current law, if a person unlawfully
 18  2 and knowingly publishes an advertisement or distributes in a
 18  3 public place a promotion for an imitation controlled substance
 18  4 the person commits a serious misdemeanor.
 18  5    The bill enhances the criminal penalties for controlled
 18  6 substances classified in Code sections 124.204(4)(ai) and
 18  7 124.204(6)(i) from an aggravated misdemeanor to a class "C"
 18  8 felony punishable pursuant to Code section 124.401(1)(c)(8).
 18  9 This change equalizes the criminal penalties with violations
 18 10 involving other schedule I controlled substances.
 18 11    The bill provides that if the same person commits two or
 18 12 more acts which are in violation of Code section 124.401(1)
 18 13 and the acts occur in the same location or time period so the
 18 14 acts are attributable to a single scheme, the acts may be
 18 15 considered a single violation and the weights of the imitation
 18 16 controlled substance may be combined for purposes of charging
 18 17 the offender.
 18 18    The amendment to Code section 124.401A provides that
 18 19 a person who is 18 years of age or older who unlawfully
 18 20 manufactures with the intent to distribute, distributes,
 18 21 or possesses with the intent to distribute an imitation
 18 22 controlled substance to another person 18 years of age or older
 18 23 within 1,000 feet of the real property comprising a public or
 18 24 nonpublic school, may be sentenced up to an additional term of
 18 25 confinement of five years in addition to any other penalty.
 18 26    The amendment to Code section 124.401B provides that
 18 27 a person who unlawfully possesses an imitation controlled
 18 28 substance within 1,000 feet of the real property comprising a
 18 29 school, public park, public pool, public recreation center, or
 18 30 marked school bus may be sentenced up to 100 hours of community
 18 31 service.
 18 32    The amendments to Code section 124.406 relate to the
 18 33 distribution or possession with the intent to distribute an
 18 34 imitation controlled substance to a person under 18 years of
 18 35 age.  A person who distributes or possesses with the intent to
 19  1 distribute an imitation controlled substance, represented to
 19  2 be a substance listed in schedule I or schedule II, to a person
 19  3 under 18 years of age commits a class "B" felony. The required
 19  4 penalty for such a violation is a minimum term of confinement
 19  5 of 10 years if the substance was distributed within 1,000
 19  6 feet of the real property comprising a public or nonpublic
 19  7 school, public park, public pool, or public recreation center.
 19  8 A person who distributes or possesses with the intent to
 19  9 distribute an imitation controlled substance, represented to be
 19 10 a substance listed in schedule III, to a person under 18 years
 19 11 of age, who is at least three years younger than the violator,
 19 12 commits a class "C" felony.  A person who distributes or
 19 13 possesses with the intent to distribute an imitation controlled
 19 14 substance, represented to be a substance listed in schedule
 19 15 IV or schedule V, to a person under 18 years of age, who is
 19 16 at least three years younger than the violator, commits an
 19 17 aggravated misdemeanor.
 19 18    The amendment to Code section 124.415 requires that a peace
 19 19 officer make a reasonable effort to identify a person under 18
 19 20 years of age discovered to be in possession of an imitation
 19 21 controlled substance, and if the person is not referred to
 19 22 juvenile court, the peace officer shall make a reasonable
 19 23 effort to notify the person's custodial parent of the
 19 24 possession unless the officer has reasonable grounds to believe
 19 25 such notification is not in the best interests of the person.
 19 26 The bill specifies that if the person is taken into custody
 19 27 the juvenile court officer shall make a reasonable effort to
 19 28 identify the school of attendance and to notify the school or
 19 29 nonpublic school of the taking into custody of the person.
 19 30    The bill creates Code section 124.417, which is similar to
 19 31 Code section 124A.5 repealed by the bill.  A person registered
 19 32 under Code section 124.302 does not violate the bill if the
 19 33 person manufactures, delivers, possesses, or possesses with the
 19 34 intent to manufacture or deliver, or acts with others to do
 19 35 such activities, if the person uses the imitation controlled
 20  1 substance for use as a placebo by a registered practitioner in
 20  2 the court of professional practice or research.
 20  3    SCHEDULE I, III, AND IV CONTROLLED SUBSTANCES.  The bill
 20  4 transfers numerous substances classified as "hallucinogenic
 20  5 substances" under schedule I and reclassifies the substances
 20  6 as "other substances" under schedule I.  By transferring the
 20  7 substances to "other substances", a person commits a class "C"
 20  8 felony under Code section 124.401(1)(c)(8) if the violation
 20  9 involves such a substance. Under current law, a person commits
 20 10 an aggravated misdemeanor under Code section 124.401(1)(d) when
 20 11 committing such violations.
 20 12    The bill adds new substances as "hallucinogenic substances"
 20 13 under schedule I.  A person commits a class "C" felony under
 20 14 Code section 124.401(1)(c)(8) if the violation involves the new
 20 15 hallucinogenic substances.
 20 16    The bill adds new substances as "stimulants" under schedule
 20 17 I.  A person commits a class "C" felony under Code section
 20 18 124.401(1)(c)(8) if the violation involves the new stimulant
 20 19 substances.
 20 20    The bill also adds new substances to the classification of
 20 21 "other substances" under schedule I.  A person commits a class
 20 22 "C" felony under Code section 124.401(1)(c)(8) for a violation
 20 23 involving the new substances.
 20 24    The bill strikes one substance classified as a
 20 25 "hallucinogenic substance" under schedule I and reclassifies
 20 26 the substance as a "stimulant" containing a synthetic cathinone
 20 27 under schedule I.  The transfer of the substance within
 20 28 schedule I also changes the criminal penalty for a violation
 20 29 involving the substance from a class "C" felony under Code
 20 30 section 124.401(1)(c)(8) to an aggravated misdemeanor under
 20 31 Code section 124.401(1)(d).  The bill also strikes a substance
 20 32 in Code section 124.204(6)(i)(3) from schedule I and does not
 20 33 reclassify the substance in any other substance schedule.
 20 34    The bill also removes numerous substances from schedule I
 20 35 which are currently classified as "stimulants" in Code section
 21  1 124.204(6)(i).
 21  2    The bill also strikes two narcotic substances from schedule
 21  3 III and adds three substances to schedule IV.  A violation
 21  4 involving a schedule IV controlled substance is punishable as
 21  5 an aggravated misdemeanor in Code section 124.401(1)(d).

 16 15    IMITATION CONTROLLED SUBSTANCES.  Under current law
 16 16 imitation controlled substances are regulated under Code
 16 17 chapter 124A.  The bill repeals Code chapter 124A and transfers
 16 18 the regulation of imitation controlled substances to Code
 16 19 chapter 124.  The definition and designation of an imitation
 16 20 controlled substance in Code chapter 124 remains identical
 16 21 to the definition and designation of an imitation controlled
 16 22 substance under current law in Code chapter 124A.
 16 23    Under the bill and in current law, an imitation controlled
 16 24 substance means a substance which is not a controlled substance
 16 25 but by color, shape, size, markings, and other aspects of
 16 26 dosage unit appearance, and packaging or other factors, appears
 16 27 to be or resembles a controlled substance. The board of
 16 28 pharmacy may designate a substance as an imitation controlled
 16 29 substance pursuant to the board's rulemaking authority and in
 16 30 accordance with Code chapter 17A.
 16 31    In addition, under current law and in the bill, if a
 16 32 substance has not been designated as an imitation controlled
 16 33 substance by the board of pharmacy and when dosage unit
 16 34 appearance alone does not establish that a substance is an
 16 35 imitation controlled substance, the following factors may
 17  1 be considered in determining whether the substance is an
 17  2 imitation controlled substance: the substance is represented
 17  3 as having the effect of a controlled substance; the substance
 17  4 is represented as a controlled substance or as a substitute for
 17  5 a controlled substance because of its nature or appearance;
 17  6 or a person receives money or other property having a value
 17  7 substantially greater than the actual value of the substance
 17  8 when sold.
 17  9    Under the bill, if a person unlawfully manufactures,
 17 10 delivers, or possesses with the intent to deliver an imitation
 17 11 controlled substance containing any detectable amount of those
 17 12 substances identified in Code section 124.204(9), or unlawfully
 17 13 acts with, enters into a common scheme or design with, or
 17 14 conspires with one or more persons to manufacture, deliver,
 17 15 or possess such imitation controlled substances, the person
 17 16 commits the following offense: a class "B" felony punishable
 17 17 by confinement of no more than 50 years and a fine of not more
 17 18 than $1 million if the imitation controlled substance is more
 17 19 than 10 kilograms; a class "B" felony punishable by confinement
 17 20 of no more than 25 years and a fine of not less than $5,000 but
 17 21 not more than $100,000 if the imitation controlled substance
 17 22 is more than five kilograms but not more than 10 kilograms; a
 17 23 class "C" felony punishable by a fine of not less than $1,000
 17 24 but not more than $50,000 if the imitation controlled substance
 17 25 is five kilograms or less; or an aggravated misdemeanor if the
 17 26 imitation controlled substance is classified in schedule IV or

 17 28 an aggravated misdemeanor for a second possession offense,
 17 29 or a class "D" felony for two or more previous possession
 17 30 offenses. Current law in Code section 124A.4 provides that if
 17 31 a person unlawfully manufactures, delivers, or possesses with
 17 32 intent to deliver an imitation controlled substance, the person
 17 33 commits an aggravated misdemeanor, or if the person delivers
 17 34 to a person under 18 years of age who is at least three years
 17 35 younger than the violator, the person commits a class "D"
 18  1 felony.  In addition, under current law, if a person unlawfully
 18  2 and knowingly publishes an advertisement or distributes in a
 18  3 public place a promotion for an imitation controlled substance
 18  4 the person commits a serious misdemeanor.
 18  5    The bill enhances the criminal penalties for controlled
 18  6 substances classified in Code sections 124.204(4)(ai) and
 18  7 124.204(6)(i) from an aggravated misdemeanor to a class "C"
 18  8 felony punishable pursuant to Code section 124.401(1)(c)(8).
 18  9 This change equalizes the criminal penalties with violations
 18 10 involving other schedule I controlled substances.
 18 11    The bill provides that if the same person commits two or
 18 12 more acts which are in violation of Code section 124.401(1)
 18 13 and the acts occur in the same location or time period so the
 18 14 acts are attributable to a single scheme, the acts may be

 18 16 controlled substance may be combined for purposes of charging
 18 17 the offender.
 18 18    The amendment to Code section 124.401A provides that
 18 19 a person who is 18 years of age or older who unlawfully
 18 20 manufactures with the intent to distribute, distributes,
 18 21 or possesses with the intent to distribute an imitation
 18 22 controlled substance to another person 18 years of age or older
 18 23 within 1,000 feet of the real property comprising a public or
 18 24 nonpublic school, may be sentenced up to an additional term of
 18 25 confinement of five years in addition to any other penalty.
 18 26    The amendment to Code section 124.401B provides that
 18 27 a person who unlawfully possesses an imitation controlled
 18 28 substance within 1,000 feet of the real property comprising a
 18 29 school, public park, public pool, public recreation center, or
 18 30 marked school bus may be sentenced up to 100 hours of community
 18 31 service.
 18 32    The amendments to Code section 124.406 relate to the
 18 33 distribution or possession with the intent to distribute an
 18 34 imitation controlled substance to a person under 18 years of
 18 35 age.  A person who distributes or possesses with the intent to
 19  1 distribute an imitation controlled substance, represented to
 19  2 be a substance listed in schedule I or schedule II, to a person
 19  3 under 18 years of age commits a class "B" felony. The required

 19  5 of 10 years if the substance was distributed within 1,000
 19  6 feet of the real property comprising a public or nonpublic
 19  7 school, public park, public pool, or public recreation center.

 19 10 a substance listed in schedule III, to a person under 18 years
 19 11 of age, who is at least three years younger than the violator,
 19 12 commits a class "C" felony.  A person who distributes or
 19 13 possesses with the intent to distribute an imitation controlled
 19 14 substance, represented to be a substance listed in schedule
 19 15 IV or schedule V, to a person under 18 years of age, who is
 19 16 at least three years younger than the violator, commits an
 19 17 aggravated misdemeanor.
 19 18    The amendment to Code section 124.415 requires that a peace
 19 19 officer make a reasonable effort to identify a person under 18
 19 20 years of age discovered to be in possession of an imitation
 19 21 controlled substance, and if the person is not referred to
 19 22 juvenile court, the peace officer shall make a reasonable
 19 23 effort to notify the person's custodial parent of the
 19 24 possession unless the officer has reasonable grounds to believe
 19 25 such notification is not in the best interests of the person.
 19 26 The bill specifies that if the person is taken into custody
 19 27 the juvenile court officer shall make a reasonable effort to
 19 28 identify the school of attendance and to notify the school or
 19 29 nonpublic school of the taking into custody of the person.
 19 30    The bill creates Code section 124.417, which is similar to
 19 31 Code section 124A.5 repealed by the bill.  A person registered
 19 32 under Code section 124.302 does not violate the bill if the
 19 33 person manufactures, delivers, possesses, or possesses with the
 19 34 intent to manufacture or deliver, or acts with others to do
 19 35 such activities, if the person uses the imitation controlled
 20  1 substance for use as a placebo by a registered practitioner in
 20  2 the court of professional practice or research.
 20  3    SCHEDULE I, III, AND IV CONTROLLED SUBSTANCES.  The bill
 20  4 transfers numerous substances classified as "hallucinogenic

 20  7 substances to "other substances", a person commits a class "C"
 20  8 felony under Code section 124.401(1)(c)(8) if the violation
 20  9 involves such a substance. Under current law, a person commits
 20 10 an aggravated misdemeanor under Code section 124.401(1)(d) when
 20 11 committing such violations.
 20 12    The bill adds new substances as "hallucinogenic substances"
 20 13 under schedule I.  A person commits a class "C" felony under
 20 14 Code section 124.401(1)(c)(8) if the violation involves the new
 20 15 hallucinogenic substances.
 20 16    The bill adds new substances as "stimulants" under schedule
 20 17 I.  A person commits a class "C" felony under Code section
 20 18 124.401(1)(c)(8) if the violation involves the new stimulant
 20 19 substances.
 20 20    The bill also adds new substances to the classification of
 20 21 "other substances" under schedule I.  A person commits a class
 20 22 "C" felony under Code section 124.401(1)(c)(8) for a violation
 20 23 involving the new substances.
 20 24    The bill strikes one substance classified as a
 20 25 "hallucinogenic substance" under schedule I and reclassifies
 20 26 the substance as a "stimulant" containing a synthetic cathinone
 20 27 under schedule I.  The transfer of the substance within
 20 28 schedule I also changes the criminal penalty for a violation
 20 29 involving the substance from a class "C" felony under Code
 20 30 section 124.401(1)(c)(8) to an aggravated misdemeanor under
 20 31 Code section 124.401(1)(d).  The bill also strikes a substance
 20 32 in Code section 124.204(6)(i)(3) from schedule I and does not
 20 33 reclassify the substance in any other substance schedule.
 20 34    The bill also removes numerous substances from schedule I
 20 35 which are currently classified as "stimulants" in Code section
 21  1 124.204(6)(i).
 21  2    The bill also strikes two narcotic substances from schedule
 21  3 III and adds three substances to schedule IV.  A violation
 21  4 involving a schedule IV controlled substance is punishable as
 21  5 an aggravated misdemeanor in Code section 124.401(1)(d).

 16 15    IMITATION CONTROLLED SUBSTANCES.  Under current law
 16 16 imitation controlled substances are regulated under Code
 16 17 chapter 124A.  The bill repeals Code chapter 124A and transfers
 16 18 the regulation of imitation controlled substances to Code
 16 19 chapter 124.  The definition and designation of an imitation
 16 20 controlled substance in Code chapter 124 remains identical
 16 21 to the definition and designation of an imitation controlled
 16 22 substance under current law in Code chapter 124A.
 16 23    Under the bill and in current law, an imitation controlled
 16 24 substance means a substance which is not a controlled substance
 16 25 but by color, shape, size, markings, and other aspects of
 16 26 dosage unit appearance, and packaging or other factors, appears
 16 27 to be or resembles a controlled substance. The board of
 16 28 pharmacy may designate a substance as an imitation controlled
 16 29 substance pursuant to the board's rulemaking authority and in
 16 30 accordance with Code chapter 17A.
 16 31    In addition, under current law and in the bill, if a
 16 32 substance has not been designated as an imitation controlled
 16 33 substance by the board of pharmacy and when dosage unit
 16 34 appearance alone does not establish that a substance is an
 16 35 imitation controlled substance, the following factors may
 17  1 be considered in determining whether the substance is an
 17  2 imitation controlled substance: the substance is represented
 17  3 as having the effect of a controlled substance; the substance
 17  4 is represented as a controlled substance or as a substitute for
 17  5 a controlled substance because of its nature or appearance;
 17  6 or a person receives money or other property having a value
 17  7 substantially greater than the actual value of the substance
 17  8 when sold.
 17  9    Under the bill, if a person unlawfully manufactures,
 17 10 delivers, or possesses with the intent to deliver an imitation
 17 11 controlled substance containing any detectable amount of those
 17 12 substances identified in Code section 124.204(9), or unlawfully
 17 13 acts with, enters into a common scheme or design with, or
 17 14 conspires with one or more persons to manufacture, deliver,
 17 15 or possess such imitation controlled substances, the person
 17 16 commits the following offense: a class "B" felony punishable
 17 17 by confinement of no more than 50 years and a fine of not more
 17 18 than $1 million if the imitation controlled substance is more
 17 19 than 10 kilograms; a class "B" felony punishable by confinement
 17 20 of no more than 25 years and a fine of not less than $5,000 but
 17 21 not more than $100,000 if the imitation controlled substance
 17 22 is more than five kilograms but not more than 10 kilograms; a
 17 23 class "C" felony punishable by a fine of not less than $1,000
 17 24 but not more than $50,000 if the imitation controlled substance
 17 25 is five kilograms or less; or an aggravated misdemeanor if the
 17 26 imitation controlled substance is classified in schedule IV or
 17 27 V; or a serious misdemeanor for a first possession offense,
 17 28 an aggravated misdemeanor for a second possession offense,
 17 29 or a class "D" felony for two or more previous possession
 17 30 offenses. Current law in Code section 124A.4 provides that if
 17 31 a person unlawfully manufactures, delivers, or possesses with
 17 32 intent to deliver an imitation controlled substance, the person
 17 33 commits an aggravated misdemeanor, or if the person delivers
 17 34 to a person under 18 years of age who is at least three years
 17 35 younger than the violator, the person commits a class "D"
 18  1 felony.  In addition, under current law, if a person unlawfully
 18  2 and knowingly publishes an advertisement or distributes in a
 18  3 public place a promotion for an imitation controlled substance
 18  4 the person commits a serious misdemeanor.
 18  5    The bill enhances the criminal penalties for controlled
 18  6 substances classified in Code sections 124.204(4)(ai) and
 18  7 124.204(6)(i) from an aggravated misdemeanor to a class "C"
 18  8 felony punishable pursuant to Code section 124.401(1)(c)(8).
 18  9 This change equalizes the criminal penalties with violations
 18 10 involving other schedule I controlled substances.
 18 11    The bill provides that if the same person commits two or
 18 12 more acts which are in violation of Code section 124.401(1)
 18 13 and the acts occur in the same location or time period so the
 18 14 acts are attributable to a single scheme, the acts may be
 18 15 considered a single violation and the weights of the imitation
 18 16 controlled substance may be combined for purposes of charging
 18 17 the offender.
 18 18    The amendment to Code section 124.401A provides that
 18 19 a person who is 18 years of age or older who unlawfully
 18 20 manufactures with the intent to distribute, distributes,
 18 21 or possesses with the intent to distribute an imitation
 18 22 controlled substance to another person 18 years of age or older
 18 23 within 1,000 feet of the real property comprising a public or
 18 24 nonpublic school, may be sentenced up to an additional term of
 18 25 confinement of five years in addition to any other penalty.
 18 26    The amendment to Code section 124.401B provides that
 18 27 a person who unlawfully possesses an imitation controlled
 18 28 substance within 1,000 feet of the real property comprising a
 18 29 school, public park, public pool, public recreation center, or
 18 30 marked school bus may be sentenced up to 100 hours of community
 18 31 service.
 18 32    The amendments to Code section 124.406 relate to the
 18 33 distribution or possession with the intent to distribute an
 18 34 imitation controlled substance to a person under 18 years of
 18 35 age.  A person who distributes or possesses with the intent to
 19  1 distribute an imitation controlled substance, represented to
 19  2 be a substance listed in schedule I or schedule II, to a person
 19  3 under 18 years of age commits a class "B" felony. The required
 19  4 penalty for such a violation is a minimum term of confinement
 19  5 of 10 years if the substance was distributed within 1,000
 19  6 feet of the real property comprising a public or nonpublic
 19  7 school, public park, public pool, or public recreation center.
 19  8 A person who distributes or possesses with the intent to
 19  9 distribute an imitation controlled substance, represented to be
 19 10 a substance listed in schedule III, to a person under 18 years
 19 11 of age, who is at least three years younger than the violator,
 19 12 commits a class "C" felony.  A person who distributes or
 19 13 possesses with the intent to distribute an imitation controlled
 19 14 substance, represented to be a substance listed in schedule
 19 15 IV or schedule V, to a person under 18 years of age, who is
 19 16 at least three years younger than the violator, commits an
 19 17 aggravated misdemeanor.
 19 18    The amendment to Code section 124.415 requires that a peace
 19 19 officer make a reasonable effort to identify a person under 18
 19 20 years of age discovered to be in possession of an imitation
 19 21 controlled substance, and if the person is not referred to
 19 22 juvenile court, the peace officer shall make a reasonable
 19 23 effort to notify the person's custodial parent of the
 19 24 possession unless the officer has reasonable grounds to believe
 19 25 such notification is not in the best interests of the person.
 19 26 The bill specifies that if the person is taken into custody
 19 27 the juvenile court officer shall make a reasonable effort to
 19 28 identify the school of attendance and to notify the school or
 19 29 nonpublic school of the taking into custody of the person.
 19 30    The bill creates Code section 124.417, which is similar to
 19 31 Code section 124A.5 repealed by the bill.  A person registered
 19 32 under Code section 124.302 does not violate the bill if the
 19 33 person manufactures, delivers, possesses, or possesses with the
 19 34 intent to manufacture or deliver, or acts with others to do
 19 35 such activities, if the person uses the imitation controlled
 20  1 substance for use as a placebo by a registered practitioner in
 20  2 the court of professional practice or research.
 20  3    SCHEDULE I, III, AND IV CONTROLLED SUBSTANCES.  The bill
 20  4 transfers numerous substances classified as "hallucinogenic
 20  5 substances" under schedule I and reclassifies the substances
 20  6 as "other substances" under schedule I.  By transferring the
 20  7 substances to "other substances", a person commits a class "C"
 20  8 felony under Code section 124.401(1)(c)(8) if the violation
 20  9 involves such a substance. Under current law, a person commits
 20 10 an aggravated misdemeanor under Code section 124.401(1)(d) when
 20 11 committing such violations.
 20 12    The bill adds new substances as "hallucinogenic substances"
 20 13 under schedule I.  A person commits a class "C" felony under
 20 14 Code section 124.401(1)(c)(8) if the violation involves the new
 20 15 hallucinogenic substances.
 20 16    The bill adds new substances as "stimulants" under schedule
 20 17 I.  A person commits a class "C" felony under Code section
 20 18 124.401(1)(c)(8) if the violation involves the new stimulant
 20 19 substances.
 20 20    The bill also adds new substances to the classification of
 20 21 "other substances" under schedule I.  A person commits a class
 20 22 "C" felony under Code section 124.401(1)(c)(8) for a violation
 20 23 involving the new substances.
 20 24    The bill strikes one substance classified as a
 20 25 "hallucinogenic substance" under schedule I and reclassifies
 20 26 the substance as a "stimulant" containing a synthetic cathinone
 20 27 under schedule I.  The transfer of the substance within
 20 28 schedule I also changes the criminal penalty for a violation
 20 29 involving the substance from a class "C" felony under Code
 20 30 section 124.401(1)(c)(8) to an aggravated misdemeanor under
 20 31 Code section 124.401(1)(d).  The bill also strikes a substance
 20 32 in Code section 124.204(6)(i)(3) from schedule I and does not
 20 33 reclassify the substance in any other substance schedule.
 20 34    The bill also removes numerous substances from schedule I
 20 35 which are currently classified as "stimulants" in Code section
 21  1 124.204(6)(i).
 21  2    The bill also strikes two narcotic substances from schedule
 21  3 III and adds three substances to schedule IV.  A violation
 21  4 involving a schedule IV controlled substance is punishable as
 21  5 an aggravated misdemeanor in Code section 124.401(1)(d).

 16 16 imitation controlled substances are regulated under Code
 16 17 chapter 124A.  The bill repeals Code chapter 124A and transfers
 16 18 the regulation of imitation controlled substances to Code
 16 19 chapter 124.  The definition and designation of an imitation
 16 20 controlled substance in Code chapter 124 remains identical
 16 21 to the definition and designation of an imitation controlled
 16 22 substance under current law in Code chapter 124A.
 16 23    Under the bill and in current law, an imitation controlled
 16 24 substance means a substance which is not a controlled substance
 16 25 but by color, shape, size, markings, and other aspects of
 16 26 dosage unit appearance, and packaging or other factors, appears
 16 27 to be or resembles a controlled substance. The board of
 16 28 pharmacy may designate a substance as an imitation controlled
 16 29 substance pursuant to the board's rulemaking authority and in
 16 30 accordance with Code chapter 17A.
 16 31    In addition, under current law and in the bill, if a
 16 32 substance has not been designated as an imitation controlled
 16 33 substance by the board of pharmacy and when dosage unit
 16 34 appearance alone does not establish that a substance is an
 16 35 imitation controlled substance, the following factors may

 17 11 controlled substance containing any detectable amount of those
 17 12 substances identified in Code section 124.204(9), or unlawfully

 17 17 by confinement of no more than 50 years and a fine of not more
 17 18 than $1 million if the imitation controlled substance is more
 17 19 than 10 kilograms; a class "B" felony punishable by confinement

 18  9 This change equalizes the criminal penalties with violations
 18 10 involving other schedule I controlled substances.
 18 11    The bill provides that if the same person commits two or
 18 12 more acts which are in violation of Code section 124.401(1)
 18 13 and the acts occur in the same location or time period so the

 20 28 schedule I also changes the criminal penalty for a violation
 20 29 involving the substance from a class "C" felony under Code
 20 30 section 124.401(1)(c)(8) to an aggravated misdemeanor under
 20 31 Code section 124.401(1)(d).  The bill also strikes a substance
 20 32 in Code section 124.204(6)(i)(3) from schedule I and does not
 20 33 reclassify the substance in any other substance schedule.
 20 34    The bill also removes numerous substances from schedule I
 20 35 which are currently classified as "stimulants" in Code section
 21  1 124.204(6)(i).
 21  2    The bill also strikes two narcotic substances from schedule
 21  3 III and adds three substances to schedule IV.  A violation

 17 22 is more than five kilograms but not more than 10 kilograms; a
 17 23 class "C" felony punishable by a fine of not less than $1,000
 17 24 but not more than $50,000 if the imitation controlled substance
 17 25 is five kilograms or less; or an aggravated misdemeanor if the
 17 26 imitation controlled substance is classified in schedule IV or
 17 27 V; or a serious misdemeanor for a first possession offense,
 17 28 an aggravated misdemeanor for a second possession offense,
 17 29 or a class "D" felony for two or more previous possession
 17 30 offenses. Current law in Code section 124A.4 provides that if
 17 31 a person unlawfully manufactures, delivers, or possesses with
 17 32 intent to deliver an imitation controlled substance, the person
 17 33 commits an aggravated misdemeanor, or if the person delivers
 17 34 to a person under 18 years of age who is at least three years
 17 35 younger than the violator, the person commits a class "D"
 18  1 felony.  In addition, under current law, if a person unlawfully
 18  2 and knowingly publishes an advertisement or distributes in a
 18  3 public place a promotion for an imitation controlled substance
 18  4 the person commits a serious misdemeanor.
 18  5    The bill enhances the criminal penalties for controlled
 18  6 substances classified in Code sections 124.204(4)(ai) and
 18  7 124.204(6)(i) from an aggravated misdemeanor to a class "C"
 18  8 felony punishable pursuant to Code section 124.401(1)(c)(8).
 18  9 This change equalizes the criminal penalties with violations
 18 10 involving other schedule I controlled substances.
 18 11    The bill provides that if the same person commits two or
 18 12 more acts which are in violation of Code section 124.401(1)
 18 13 and the acts occur in the same location or time period so the
 18 14 acts are attributable to a single scheme, the acts may be
 18 15 considered a single violation and the weights of the imitation
 18 16 controlled substance may be combined for purposes of charging
 18 17 the offender.
 18 18    The amendment to Code section 124.401A provides that
 18 19 a person who is 18 years of age or older who unlawfully
 18 20 manufactures with the intent to distribute, distributes,
 18 21 or possesses with the intent to distribute an imitation
 18 22 controlled substance to another person 18 years of age or older
 18 23 within 1,000 feet of the real property comprising a public or
 18 24 nonpublic school, may be sentenced up to an additional term of
 18 25 confinement of five years in addition to any other penalty.
 18 26    The amendment to Code section 124.401B provides that
 18 27 a person who unlawfully possesses an imitation controlled
 18 28 substance within 1,000 feet of the real property comprising a
 18 29 school, public park, public pool, public recreation center, or
 18 30 marked school bus may be sentenced up to 100 hours of community
 18 31 service.
 18 32    The amendments to Code section 124.406 relate to the
 18 33 distribution or possession with the intent to distribute an
 18 34 imitation controlled substance to a person under 18 years of
 18 35 age.  A person who distributes or possesses with the intent to
 19  1 distribute an imitation controlled substance, represented to
 19  2 be a substance listed in schedule I or schedule II, to a person
 19  3 under 18 years of age commits a class "B" felony. The required
 19  4 penalty for such a violation is a minimum term of confinement
 19  5 of 10 years if the substance was distributed within 1,000
 19  6 feet of the real property comprising a public or nonpublic
 19  7 school, public park, public pool, or public recreation center.
 19  8 A person who distributes or possesses with the intent to
 19  9 distribute an imitation controlled substance, represented to be
 19 10 a substance listed in schedule III, to a person under 18 years
 19 11 of age, who is at least three years younger than the violator,
 19 12 commits a class "C" felony.  A person who distributes or
 19 13 possesses with the intent to distribute an imitation controlled
 19 14 substance, represented to be a substance listed in schedule
 19 15 IV or schedule V, to a person under 18 years of age, who is
 19 16 at least three years younger than the violator, commits an
 19 17 aggravated misdemeanor.
 19 18    The amendment to Code section 124.415 requires that a peace
 19 19 officer make a reasonable effort to identify a person under 18
 19 20 years of age discovered to be in possession of an imitation
 19 21 controlled substance, and if the person is not referred to
 19 22 juvenile court, the peace officer shall make a reasonable
 19 23 effort to notify the person's custodial parent of the
 19 24 possession unless the officer has reasonable grounds to believe
 19 25 such notification is not in the best interests of the person.
 19 26 The bill specifies that if the person is taken into custody
 19 27 the juvenile court officer shall make a reasonable effort to
 19 28 identify the school of attendance and to notify the school or
 19 29 nonpublic school of the taking into custody of the person.
 19 30    The bill creates Code section 124.417, which is similar to
 19 31 Code section 124A.5 repealed by the bill.  A person registered
 19 32 under Code section 124.302 does not violate the bill if the
 19 33 person manufactures, delivers, possesses, or possesses with the
 19 34 intent to manufacture or deliver, or acts with others to do
 19 35 such activities, if the person uses the imitation controlled
 20  1 substance for use as a placebo by a registered practitioner in
 20  2 the court of professional practice or research.
 20  3    SCHEDULE I, III, AND IV CONTROLLED SUBSTANCES.  The bill
 20  4 transfers numerous substances classified as "hallucinogenic
 20  5 substances" under schedule I and reclassifies the substances
 20  6 as "other substances" under schedule I.  By transferring the
 20  7 substances to "other substances", a person commits a class "C"
 20  8 felony under Code section 124.401(1)(c)(8) if the violation
 20  9 involves such a substance. Under current law, a person commits
 20 10 an aggravated misdemeanor under Code section 124.401(1)(d) when
 20 11 committing such violations.
 20 12    The bill adds new substances as "hallucinogenic substances"
 20 13 under schedule I.  A person commits a class "C" felony under
 20 14 Code section 124.401(1)(c)(8) if the violation involves the new
 20 15 hallucinogenic substances.
 20 16    The bill adds new substances as "stimulants" under schedule
 20 17 I.  A person commits a class "C" felony under Code section
 20 18 124.401(1)(c)(8) if the violation involves the new stimulant
 20 19 substances.
 20 20    The bill also adds new substances to the classification of
 20 21 "other substances" under schedule I.  A person commits a class
 20 22 "C" felony under Code section 124.401(1)(c)(8) for a violation
 20 23 involving the new substances.
 20 24    The bill strikes one substance classified as a
 20 25 "hallucinogenic substance" under schedule I and reclassifies
 20 26 the substance as a "stimulant" containing a synthetic cathinone
 20 27 under schedule I.  The transfer of the substance within
 20 28 schedule I also changes the criminal penalty for a violation
 20 29 involving the substance from a class "C" felony under Code
 20 30 section 124.401(1)(c)(8) to an aggravated misdemeanor under
 20 31 Code section 124.401(1)(d).  The bill also strikes a substance
 20 32 in Code section 124.204(6)(i)(3) from schedule I and does not
 20 33 reclassify the substance in any other substance schedule.
 20 34    The bill also removes numerous substances from schedule I
 20 35 which are currently classified as "stimulants" in Code section
 21  1 124.204(6)(i).
 21  2    The bill also strikes two narcotic substances from schedule
 21  3 III and adds three substances to schedule IV.  A violation
 21  4 involving a schedule IV controlled substance is punishable as
 21  5 an aggravated misdemeanor in Code section 124.401(1)(d).

 16 18 the regulation of imitation controlled substances to Code
 16 19 chapter 124.  The definition and designation of an imitation
 16 20 controlled substance in Code chapter 124 remains identical
 16 21 to the definition and designation of an imitation controlled
 16 22 substance under current law in Code chapter 124A.
 16 23    Under the bill and in current law, an imitation controlled
 16 24 substance means a substance which is not a controlled substance
 16 25 but by color, shape, size, markings, and other aspects of
 16 26 dosage unit appearance, and packaging or other factors, appears
 16 27 to be or resembles a controlled substance. The board of
 16 28 pharmacy may designate a substance as an imitation controlled
 16 29 substance pursuant to the board's rulemaking authority and in
 16 30 accordance with Code chapter 17A.
 16 31    In addition, under current law and in the bill, if a
 16 32 substance has not been designated as an imitation controlled
 16 33 substance by the board of pharmacy and when dosage unit
 16 34 appearance alone does not establish that a substance is an
 16 35 imitation controlled substance, the following factors may
 17  1 be considered in determining whether the substance is an
 17  2 imitation controlled substance: the substance is represented
 17  3 as having the effect of a controlled substance; the substance
 17  4 is represented as a controlled substance or as a substitute for
 17  5 a controlled substance because of its nature or appearance;
 17  6 or a person receives money or other property having a value
 17  7 substantially greater than the actual value of the substance
 17  8 when sold.
 17  9    Under the bill, if a person unlawfully manufactures,
 17 10 delivers, or possesses with the intent to deliver an imitation
 17 11 controlled substance containing any detectable amount of those
 17 12 substances identified in Code section 124.204(9), or unlawfully
 17 13 acts with, enters into a common scheme or design with, or
 17 14 conspires with one or more persons to manufacture, deliver,
 17 15 or possess such imitation controlled substances, the person
 17 16 commits the following offense: a class "B" felony punishable
 17 17 by confinement of no more than 50 years and a fine of not more
 17 18 than $1 million if the imitation controlled substance is more
 17 19 than 10 kilograms; a class "B" felony punishable by confinement
 17 20 of no more than 25 years and a fine of not less than $5,000 but
 17 21 not more than $100,000 if the imitation controlled substance
 17 22 is more than five kilograms but not more than 10 kilograms; a
 17 23 class "C" felony punishable by a fine of not less than $1,000
 17 24 but not more than $50,000 if the imitation controlled substance
 17 25 is five kilograms or less; or an aggravated misdemeanor if the
 17 26 imitation controlled substance is classified in schedule IV or
 17 27 V; or a serious misdemeanor for a first possession offense,
 17 28 an aggravated misdemeanor for a second possession offense,
 17 29 or a class "D" felony for two or more previous possession
 17 30 offenses. Current law in Code section 124A.4 provides that if
 17 31 a person unlawfully manufactures, delivers, or possesses with
 17 32 intent to deliver an imitation controlled substance, the person
 17 33 commits an aggravated misdemeanor, or if the person delivers
 17 34 to a person under 18 years of age who is at least three years
 17 35 younger than the violator, the person commits a class "D"
 18  1 felony.  In addition, under current law, if a person unlawfully
 18  2 and knowingly publishes an advertisement or distributes in a
 18  3 public place a promotion for an imitation controlled substance
 18  4 the person commits a serious misdemeanor.
 18  5    The bill enhances the criminal penalties for controlled
 18  6 substances classified in Code sections 124.204(4)(ai) and
 18  7 124.204(6)(i) from an aggravated misdemeanor to a class "C"
 18  8 felony punishable pursuant to Code section 124.401(1)(c)(8).
 18  9 This change equalizes the criminal penalties with violations
 18 10 involving other schedule I controlled substances.
 18 11    The bill provides that if the same person commits two or
 18 12 more acts which are in violation of Code section 124.401(1)
 18 13 and the acts occur in the same location or time period so the
 18 14 acts are attributable to a single scheme, the acts may be
 18 15 considered a single violation and the weights of the imitation
 18 16 controlled substance may be combined for purposes of charging
 18 17 the offender.
 18 18    The amendment to Code section 124.401A provides that
 18 19 a person who is 18 years of age or older who unlawfully
 18 20 manufactures with the intent to distribute, distributes,
 18 21 or possesses with the intent to distribute an imitation
 18 22 controlled substance to another person 18 years of age or older
 18 23 within 1,000 feet of the real property comprising a public or
 18 24 nonpublic school, may be sentenced up to an additional term of
 18 25 confinement of five years in addition to any other penalty.
 18 26    The amendment to Code section 124.401B provides that
 18 27 a person who unlawfully possesses an imitation controlled
 18 28 substance within 1,000 feet of the real property comprising a
 18 29 school, public park, public pool, public recreation center, or
 18 30 marked school bus may be sentenced up to 100 hours of community
 18 31 service.
 18 32    The amendments to Code section 124.406 relate to the
 18 33 distribution or possession with the intent to distribute an
 18 34 imitation controlled substance to a person under 18 years of
 18 35 age.  A person who distributes or possesses with the intent to
 19  1 distribute an imitation controlled substance, represented to
 19  2 be a substance listed in schedule I or schedule II, to a person
 19  3 under 18 years of age commits a class "B" felony. The required
 19  4 penalty for such a violation is a minimum term of confinement
 19  5 of 10 years if the substance was distributed within 1,000
 19  6 feet of the real property comprising a public or nonpublic
 19  7 school, public park, public pool, or public recreation center.
 19  8 A person who distributes or possesses with the intent to
 19  9 distribute an imitation controlled substance, represented to be
 19 10 a substance listed in schedule III, to a person under 18 years
 19 11 of age, who is at least three years younger than the violator,

 19 13 possesses with the intent to distribute an imitation controlled
 19 14 substance, represented to be a substance listed in schedule
 19 15 IV or schedule V, to a person under 18 years of age, who is
 19 16 at least three years younger than the violator, commits an
 19 17 aggravated misdemeanor.
 19 18    The amendment to Code section 124.415 requires that a peace
 19 19 officer make a reasonable effort to identify a person under 18
 19 20 years of age discovered to be in possession of an imitation
 19 21 controlled substance, and if the person is not referred to
 19 22 juvenile court, the peace officer shall make a reasonable
 19 23 effort to notify the person's custodial parent of the
 19 24 possession unless the officer has reasonable grounds to believe
 19 25 such notification is not in the best interests of the person.
 19 26 The bill specifies that if the person is taken into custody
 19 27 the juvenile court officer shall make a reasonable effort to
 19 28 identify the school of attendance and to notify the school or
 19 29 nonpublic school of the taking into custody of the person.
 19 30    The bill creates Code section 124.417, which is similar to
 19 31 Code section 124A.5 repealed by the bill.  A person registered
 19 32 under Code section 124.302 does not violate the bill if the
 19 33 person manufactures, delivers, possesses, or possesses with the
 19 34 intent to manufacture or deliver, or acts with others to do
 19 35 such activities, if the person uses the imitation controlled
 20  1 substance for use as a placebo by a registered practitioner in

 20  4 transfers numerous substances classified as "hallucinogenic
 20  5 substances" under schedule I and reclassifies the substances
 20  6 as "other substances" under schedule I.  By transferring the
 20  7 substances to "other substances", a person commits a class "C"
 20  8 felony under Code section 124.401(1)(c)(8) if the violation
 20  9 involves such a substance. Under current law, a person commits
 20 10 an aggravated misdemeanor under Code section 124.401(1)(d) when
 20 11 committing such violations.
 20 12    The bill adds new substances as "hallucinogenic substances"
 20 13 under schedule I.  A person commits a class "C" felony under
 20 14 Code section 124.401(1)(c)(8) if the violation involves the new
 20 15 hallucinogenic substances.
 20 16    The bill adds new substances as "stimulants" under schedule
 20 17 I.  A person commits a class "C" felony under Code section
 20 18 124.401(1)(c)(8) if the violation involves the new stimulant
 20 19 substances.
 20 20    The bill also adds new substances to the classification of
 20 21 "other substances" under schedule I.  A person commits a class
 20 22 "C" felony under Code section 124.401(1)(c)(8) for a violation
 20 23 involving the new substances.
 20 24    The bill strikes one substance classified as a
 20 25 "hallucinogenic substance" under schedule I and reclassifies
 20 26 the substance as a "stimulant" containing a synthetic cathinone
 20 27 under schedule I.  The transfer of the substance within
 20 28 schedule I also changes the criminal penalty for a violation
 20 29 involving the substance from a class "C" felony under Code
 20 30 section 124.401(1)(c)(8) to an aggravated misdemeanor under
 20 31 Code section 124.401(1)(d).  The bill also strikes a substance
 20 32 in Code section 124.204(6)(i)(3) from schedule I and does not
 20 33 reclassify the substance in any other substance schedule.
 20 34    The bill also removes numerous substances from schedule I
 20 35 which are currently classified as "stimulants" in Code section
 21  1 124.204(6)(i).
 21  2    The bill also strikes two narcotic substances from schedule
 21  3 III and adds three substances to schedule IV.  A violation
 21  4 involving a schedule IV controlled substance is punishable as

 16 30 accordance with Code chapter 17A.
 16 31    In addition, under current law and in the bill, if a

 19 18    The amendment to Code section 124.415 requires that a peace
 19 19 officer make a reasonable effort to identify a person under 18
 19 20 years of age discovered to be in possession of an imitation
 19 21 controlled substance, and if the person is not referred to
 19 22 juvenile court, the peace officer shall make a reasonable
 19 23 effort to notify the person's custodial parent of the
 19 24 possession unless the officer has reasonable grounds to believe
 19 25 such notification is not in the best interests of the person.
 19 26 The bill specifies that if the person is taken into custody
 19 27 the juvenile court officer shall make a reasonable effort to
 19 28 identify the school of attendance and to notify the school or
 19 29 nonpublic school of the taking into custody of the person.
 19 30    The bill creates Code section 124.417, which is similar to
 19 31 Code section 124A.5 repealed by the bill.  A person registered
 19 32 under Code section 124.302 does not violate the bill if the
 19 33 person manufactures, delivers, possesses, or possesses with the
 19 34 intent to manufacture or deliver, or acts with others to do
 19 35 such activities, if the person uses the imitation controlled
 20  1 substance for use as a placebo by a registered practitioner in
 20  2 the court of professional practice or research.
 20  3    SCHEDULE I, III, AND IV CONTROLLED SUBSTANCES.  The bill
 20  4 transfers numerous substances classified as "hallucinogenic
 20  5 substances" under schedule I and reclassifies the substances
 20  6 as "other substances" under schedule I.  By transferring the
 20  7 substances to "other substances", a person commits a class "C"
 20  8 felony under Code section 124.401(1)(c)(8) if the violation
 20  9 involves such a substance. Under current law, a person commits
 20 10 an aggravated misdemeanor under Code section 124.401(1)(d) when
 20 11 committing such violations.
 20 12    The bill adds new substances as "hallucinogenic substances"
 20 13 under schedule I.  A person commits a class "C" felony under
 20 14 Code section 124.401(1)(c)(8) if the violation involves the new
 20 15 hallucinogenic substances.
 20 16    The bill adds new substances as "stimulants" under schedule
 20 17 I.  A person commits a class "C" felony under Code section
 20 18 124.401(1)(c)(8) if the violation involves the new stimulant
 20 19 substances.
 20 20    The bill also adds new substances to the classification of
 20 21 "other substances" under schedule I.  A person commits a class
 20 22 "C" felony under Code section 124.401(1)(c)(8) for a violation
 20 23 involving the new substances.
 20 24    The bill strikes one substance classified as a
 20 25 "hallucinogenic substance" under schedule I and reclassifies
 20 26 the substance as a "stimulant" containing a synthetic cathinone
 20 27 under schedule I.  The transfer of the substance within
 20 28 schedule I also changes the criminal penalty for a violation
 20 29 involving the substance from a class "C" felony under Code
 20 30 section 124.401(1)(c)(8) to an aggravated misdemeanor under
 20 31 Code section 124.401(1)(d).  The bill also strikes a substance
 20 32 in Code section 124.204(6)(i)(3) from schedule I and does not
 20 33 reclassify the substance in any other substance schedule.
 20 34    The bill also removes numerous substances from schedule I
 20 35 which are currently classified as "stimulants" in Code section
 21  1 124.204(6)(i).
 21  2    The bill also strikes two narcotic substances from schedule
 21  3 III and adds three substances to schedule IV.  A violation
 21  4 involving a schedule IV controlled substance is punishable as
 21  5 an aggravated misdemeanor in Code section 124.401(1)(d).

 16 20 controlled substance in Code chapter 124 remains identical
 16 21 to the definition and designation of an imitation controlled
 16 22 substance under current law in Code chapter 124A.
 16 23    Under the bill and in current law, an imitation controlled
 16 24 substance means a substance which is not a controlled substance
 16 25 but by color, shape, size, markings, and other aspects of
 16 26 dosage unit appearance, and packaging or other factors, appears
 16 27 to be or resembles a controlled substance. The board of
 16 28 pharmacy may designate a substance as an imitation controlled
 16 29 substance pursuant to the board's rulemaking authority and in
 16 30 accordance with Code chapter 17A.
 16 31    In addition, under current law and in the bill, if a
 16 32 substance has not been designated as an imitation controlled
 16 33 substance by the board of pharmacy and when dosage unit
 16 34 appearance alone does not establish that a substance is an
 16 35 imitation controlled substance, the following factors may
 17  1 be considered in determining whether the substance is an
 17  2 imitation controlled substance: the substance is represented
 17  3 as having the effect of a controlled substance; the substance
 17  4 is represented as a controlled substance or as a substitute for
 17  5 a controlled substance because of its nature or appearance;
 17  6 or a person receives money or other property having a value
 17  7 substantially greater than the actual value of the substance
 17  8 when sold.
 17  9    Under the bill, if a person unlawfully manufactures,
 17 10 delivers, or possesses with the intent to deliver an imitation
 17 11 controlled substance containing any detectable amount of those
 17 12 substances identified in Code section 124.204(9), or unlawfully
 17 13 acts with, enters into a common scheme or design with, or
 17 14 conspires with one or more persons to manufacture, deliver,
 17 15 or possess such imitation controlled substances, the person
 17 16 commits the following offense: a class "B" felony punishable
 17 17 by confinement of no more than 50 years and a fine of not more
 17 18 than $1 million if the imitation controlled substance is more
 17 19 than 10 kilograms; a class "B" felony punishable by confinement
 17 20 of no more than 25 years and a fine of not less than $5,000 but
 17 21 not more than $100,000 if the imitation controlled substance
 17 22 is more than five kilograms but not more than 10 kilograms; a
 17 23 class "C" felony punishable by a fine of not less than $1,000
 17 24 but not more than $50,000 if the imitation controlled substance
 17 25 is five kilograms or less; or an aggravated misdemeanor if the
 17 26 imitation controlled substance is classified in schedule IV or
 17 27 V; or a serious misdemeanor for a first possession offense,
 17 28 an aggravated misdemeanor for a second possession offense,
 17 29 or a class "D" felony for two or more previous possession
 17 30 offenses. Current law in Code section 124A.4 provides that if
 17 31 a person unlawfully manufactures, delivers, or possesses with
 17 32 intent to deliver an imitation controlled substance, the person
 17 33 commits an aggravated misdemeanor, or if the person delivers
 17 34 to a person under 18 years of age who is at least three years
 17 35 younger than the violator, the person commits a class "D"
 18  1 felony.  In addition, under current law, if a person unlawfully
 18  2 and knowingly publishes an advertisement or distributes in a
 18  3 public place a promotion for an imitation controlled substance
 18  4 the person commits a serious misdemeanor.
 18  5    The bill enhances the criminal penalties for controlled
 18  6 substances classified in Code sections 124.204(4)(ai) and
 18  7 124.204(6)(i) from an aggravated misdemeanor to a class "C"
 18  8 felony punishable pursuant to Code section 124.401(1)(c)(8).
 18  9 This change equalizes the criminal penalties with violations
 18 10 involving other schedule I controlled substances.
 18 11    The bill provides that if the same person commits two or
 18 12 more acts which are in violation of Code section 124.401(1)
 18 13 and the acts occur in the same location or time period so the
 18 14 acts are attributable to a single scheme, the acts may be
 18 15 considered a single violation and the weights of the imitation
 18 16 controlled substance may be combined for purposes of charging
 18 17 the offender.
 18 18    The amendment to Code section 124.401A provides that
 18 19 a person who is 18 years of age or older who unlawfully
 18 20 manufactures with the intent to distribute, distributes,
 18 21 or possesses with the intent to distribute an imitation
 18 22 controlled substance to another person 18 years of age or older
 18 23 within 1,000 feet of the real property comprising a public or
 18 24 nonpublic school, may be sentenced up to an additional term of
 18 25 confinement of five years in addition to any other penalty.
 18 26    The amendment to Code section 124.401B provides that
 18 27 a person who unlawfully possesses an imitation controlled
 18 28 substance within 1,000 feet of the real property comprising a
 18 29 school, public park, public pool, public recreation center, or
 18 30 marked school bus may be sentenced up to 100 hours of community
 18 31 service.
 18 32    The amendments to Code section 124.406 relate to the
 18 33 distribution or possession with the intent to distribute an
 18 34 imitation controlled substance to a person under 18 years of
 18 35 age.  A person who distributes or possesses with the intent to
 19  1 distribute an imitation controlled substance, represented to
 19  2 be a substance listed in schedule I or schedule II, to a person
 19  3 under 18 years of age commits a class "B" felony. The required
 19  4 penalty for such a violation is a minimum term of confinement
 19  5 of 10 years if the substance was distributed within 1,000
 19  6 feet of the real property comprising a public or nonpublic
 19  7 school, public park, public pool, or public recreation center.
 19  8 A person who distributes or possesses with the intent to
 19  9 distribute an imitation controlled substance, represented to be
 19 10 a substance listed in schedule III, to a person under 18 years
 19 11 of age, who is at least three years younger than the violator,
 19 12 commits a class "C" felony.  A person who distributes or
 19 13 possesses with the intent to distribute an imitation controlled
 19 14 substance, represented to be a substance listed in schedule
 19 15 IV or schedule V, to a person under 18 years of age, who is
 19 16 at least three years younger than the violator, commits an
 19 17 aggravated misdemeanor.
 19 18    The amendment to Code section 124.415 requires that a peace
 19 19 officer make a reasonable effort to identify a person under 18
 19 20 years of age discovered to be in possession of an imitation
 19 21 controlled substance, and if the person is not referred to
 19 22 juvenile court, the peace officer shall make a reasonable
 19 23 effort to notify the person's custodial parent of the
 19 24 possession unless the officer has reasonable grounds to believe
 19 25 such notification is not in the best interests of the person.
 19 26 The bill specifies that if the person is taken into custody
 19 27 the juvenile court officer shall make a reasonable effort to
 19 28 identify the school of attendance and to notify the school or
 19 29 nonpublic school of the taking into custody of the person.
 19 30    The bill creates Code section 124.417, which is similar to
 19 31 Code section 124A.5 repealed by the bill.  A person registered
 19 32 under Code section 124.302 does not violate the bill if the
 19 33 person manufactures, delivers, possesses, or possesses with the
 19 34 intent to manufacture or deliver, or acts with others to do
 19 35 such activities, if the person uses the imitation controlled
 20  1 substance for use as a placebo by a registered practitioner in

 20  9 involves such a substance. Under current law, a person commits
 20 10 an aggravated misdemeanor under Code section 124.401(1)(d) when
 20 11 committing such violations.
 20 12    The bill adds new substances as "hallucinogenic substances"
 20 13 under schedule I.  A person commits a class "C" felony under
 20 14 Code section 124.401(1)(c)(8) if the violation involves the new
 20 15 hallucinogenic substances.
 20 16    The bill adds new substances as "stimulants" under schedule
 20 17 I.  A person commits a class "C" felony under Code section
 20 18 124.401(1)(c)(8) if the violation involves the new stimulant
 20 19 substances.
 20 20    The bill also adds new substances to the classification of
 20 21 "other substances" under schedule I.  A person commits a class
 20 22 "C" felony under Code section 124.401(1)(c)(8) for a violation
 20 23 involving the new substances.
 20 24    The bill strikes one substance classified as a
 20 25 "hallucinogenic substance" under schedule I and reclassifies
 20 26 the substance as a "stimulant" containing a synthetic cathinone
 20 27 under schedule I.  The transfer of the substance within
 20 28 schedule I also changes the criminal penalty for a violation
 20 29 involving the substance from a class "C" felony under Code
 20 30 section 124.401(1)(c)(8) to an aggravated misdemeanor under
 20 31 Code section 124.401(1)(d).  The bill also strikes a substance
 20 32 in Code section 124.204(6)(i)(3) from schedule I and does not
 20 33 reclassify the substance in any other substance schedule.
 20 34    The bill also removes numerous substances from schedule I
 20 35 which are currently classified as "stimulants" in Code section
 21  1 124.204(6)(i).
 21  2    The bill also strikes two narcotic substances from schedule
 21  3 III and adds three substances to schedule IV.  A violation

 16 32 substance has not been designated as an imitation controlled
 16 33 substance by the board of pharmacy and when dosage unit
 16 34 appearance alone does not establish that a substance is an
 16 35 imitation controlled substance, the following factors may
 17  1 be considered in determining whether the substance is an
 17  2 imitation controlled substance: the substance is represented
 17  3 as having the effect of a controlled substance; the substance
 17  4 is represented as a controlled substance or as a substitute for
 17  5 a controlled substance because of its nature or appearance;
 17  6 or a person receives money or other property having a value
 17  7 substantially greater than the actual value of the substance
 17  8 when sold.
 17  9    Under the bill, if a person unlawfully manufactures,
 17 10 delivers, or possesses with the intent to deliver an imitation
 17 11 controlled substance containing any detectable amount of those
 17 12 substances identified in Code section 124.204(9), or unlawfully
 17 13 acts with, enters into a common scheme or design with, or
 17 14 conspires with one or more persons to manufacture, deliver,
 17 15 or possess such imitation controlled substances, the person
 17 16 commits the following offense: a class "B" felony punishable
 17 17 by confinement of no more than 50 years and a fine of not more
 17 18 than $1 million if the imitation controlled substance is more
 17 19 than 10 kilograms; a class "B" felony punishable by confinement
 17 20 of no more than 25 years and a fine of not less than $5,000 but
 17 21 not more than $100,000 if the imitation controlled substance
 17 22 is more than five kilograms but not more than 10 kilograms; a
 17 23 class "C" felony punishable by a fine of not less than $1,000
 17 24 but not more than $50,000 if the imitation controlled substance
 17 25 is five kilograms or less; or an aggravated misdemeanor if the
 17 26 imitation controlled substance is classified in schedule IV or
 17 27 V; or a serious misdemeanor for a first possession offense,
 17 28 an aggravated misdemeanor for a second possession offense,
 17 29 or a class "D" felony for two or more previous possession
 17 30 offenses. Current law in Code section 124A.4 provides that if
 17 31 a person unlawfully manufactures, delivers, or possesses with
 17 32 intent to deliver an imitation controlled substance, the person
 17 33 commits an aggravated misdemeanor, or if the person delivers
 17 34 to a person under 18 years of age who is at least three years
 17 35 younger than the violator, the person commits a class "D"
 18  1 felony.  In addition, under current law, if a person unlawfully
 18  2 and knowingly publishes an advertisement or distributes in a
 18  3 public place a promotion for an imitation controlled substance
 18  4 the person commits a serious misdemeanor.
 18  5    The bill enhances the criminal penalties for controlled
 18  6 substances classified in Code sections 124.204(4)(ai) and
 18  7 124.204(6)(i) from an aggravated misdemeanor to a class "C"
 18  8 felony punishable pursuant to Code section 124.401(1)(c)(8).
 18  9 This change equalizes the criminal penalties with violations
 18 10 involving other schedule I controlled substances.
 18 11    The bill provides that if the same person commits two or
 18 12 more acts which are in violation of Code section 124.401(1)
 18 13 and the acts occur in the same location or time period so the
 18 14 acts are attributable to a single scheme, the acts may be
 18 15 considered a single violation and the weights of the imitation
 18 16 controlled substance may be combined for purposes of charging
 18 17 the offender.
 18 18    The amendment to Code section 124.401A provides that
 18 19 a person who is 18 years of age or older who unlawfully
 18 20 manufactures with the intent to distribute, distributes,
 18 21 or possesses with the intent to distribute an imitation
 18 22 controlled substance to another person 18 years of age or older
 18 23 within 1,000 feet of the real property comprising a public or
 18 24 nonpublic school, may be sentenced up to an additional term of
 18 25 confinement of five years in addition to any other penalty.
 18 26    The amendment to Code section 124.401B provides that
 18 27 a person who unlawfully possesses an imitation controlled
 18 28 substance within 1,000 feet of the real property comprising a
 18 29 school, public park, public pool, public recreation center, or
 18 30 marked school bus may be sentenced up to 100 hours of community
 18 31 service.
 18 32    The amendments to Code section 124.406 relate to the
 18 33 distribution or possession with the intent to distribute an
 18 34 imitation controlled substance to a person under 18 years of
 18 35 age.  A person who distributes or possesses with the intent to
 19  1 distribute an imitation controlled substance, represented to
 19  2 be a substance listed in schedule I or schedule II, to a person
 19  3 under 18 years of age commits a class "B" felony. The required
 19  4 penalty for such a violation is a minimum term of confinement
 19  5 of 10 years if the substance was distributed within 1,000
 19  6 feet of the real property comprising a public or nonpublic
 19  7 school, public park, public pool, or public recreation center.
 19  8 A person who distributes or possesses with the intent to
 19  9 distribute an imitation controlled substance, represented to be
 19 10 a substance listed in schedule III, to a person under 18 years
 19 11 of age, who is at least three years younger than the violator,
 19 12 commits a class "C" felony.  A person who distributes or
 19 13 possesses with the intent to distribute an imitation controlled
 19 14 substance, represented to be a substance listed in schedule
 19 15 IV or schedule V, to a person under 18 years of age, who is
 19 16 at least three years younger than the violator, commits an
 19 17 aggravated misdemeanor.
 19 18    The amendment to Code section 124.415 requires that a peace
 19 19 officer make a reasonable effort to identify a person under 18
 19 20 years of age discovered to be in possession of an imitation
 19 21 controlled substance, and if the person is not referred to
 19 22 juvenile court, the peace officer shall make a reasonable
 19 23 effort to notify the person's custodial parent of the
 19 24 possession unless the officer has reasonable grounds to believe
 19 25 such notification is not in the best interests of the person.
 19 26 The bill specifies that if the person is taken into custody
 19 27 the juvenile court officer shall make a reasonable effort to
 19 28 identify the school of attendance and to notify the school or
 19 29 nonpublic school of the taking into custody of the person.
 19 30    The bill creates Code section 124.417, which is similar to
 19 31 Code section 124A.5 repealed by the bill.  A person registered
 19 32 under Code section 124.302 does not violate the bill if the
 19 33 person manufactures, delivers, possesses, or possesses with the
 19 34 intent to manufacture or deliver, or acts with others to do
 19 35 such activities, if the person uses the imitation controlled
 20  1 substance for use as a placebo by a registered practitioner in
 20  2 the court of professional practice or research.
 20  3    SCHEDULE I, III, AND IV CONTROLLED SUBSTANCES.  The bill
 20  4 transfers numerous substances classified as "hallucinogenic
 20  5 substances" under schedule I and reclassifies the substances
 20  6 as "other substances" under schedule I.  By transferring the
 20  7 substances to "other substances", a person commits a class "C"
 20  8 felony under Code section 124.401(1)(c)(8) if the violation
 20  9 involves such a substance. Under current law, a person commits
 20 10 an aggravated misdemeanor under Code section 124.401(1)(d) when
 20 11 committing such violations.
 20 12    The bill adds new substances as "hallucinogenic substances"
 20 13 under schedule I.  A person commits a class "C" felony under
 20 14 Code section 124.401(1)(c)(8) if the violation involves the new
 20 15 hallucinogenic substances.
 20 16    The bill adds new substances as "stimulants" under schedule
 20 17 I.  A person commits a class "C" felony under Code section
 20 18 124.401(1)(c)(8) if the violation involves the new stimulant
 20 19 substances.
 20 20    The bill also adds new substances to the classification of
 20 21 "other substances" under schedule I.  A person commits a class
 20 22 "C" felony under Code section 124.401(1)(c)(8) for a violation
 20 23 involving the new substances.
 20 24    The bill strikes one substance classified as a
 20 25 "hallucinogenic substance" under schedule I and reclassifies
 20 26 the substance as a "stimulant" containing a synthetic cathinone
 20 27 under schedule I.  The transfer of the substance within
 20 28 schedule I also changes the criminal penalty for a violation
 20 29 involving the substance from a class "C" felony under Code
 20 30 section 124.401(1)(c)(8) to an aggravated misdemeanor under
 20 31 Code section 124.401(1)(d).  The bill also strikes a substance
 20 32 in Code section 124.204(6)(i)(3) from schedule I and does not
 20 33 reclassify the substance in any other substance schedule.
 20 34    The bill also removes numerous substances from schedule I
 20 35 which are currently classified as "stimulants" in Code section
 21  1 124.204(6)(i).
 21  2    The bill also strikes two narcotic substances from schedule
 21  3 III and adds three substances to schedule IV.  A violation
 21  4 involving a schedule IV controlled substance is punishable as
 21  5 an aggravated misdemeanor in Code section 124.401(1)(d).

 16 23    Under the bill and in current law, an imitation controlled
 16 24 substance means a substance which is not a controlled substance
 16 25 but by color, shape, size, markings, and other aspects of
 16 26 dosage unit appearance, and packaging or other factors, appears
 16 27 to be or resembles a controlled substance. The board of
 16 28 pharmacy may designate a substance as an imitation controlled
 16 29 substance pursuant to the board's rulemaking authority and in
 16 30 accordance with Code chapter 17A.
 16 31    In addition, under current law and in the bill, if a
 16 32 substance has not been designated as an imitation controlled
 16 33 substance by the board of pharmacy and when dosage unit
 16 34 appearance alone does not establish that a substance is an
 16 35 imitation controlled substance, the following factors may
 17  1 be considered in determining whether the substance is an
 17  2 imitation controlled substance: the substance is represented

 17 11 controlled substance containing any detectable amount of those
 17 12 substances identified in Code section 124.204(9), or unlawfully
 17 13 acts with, enters into a common scheme or design with, or
 17 14 conspires with one or more persons to manufacture, deliver,
 17 15 or possess such imitation controlled substances, the person
 17 16 commits the following offense: a class "B" felony punishable
 17 17 by confinement of no more than 50 years and a fine of not more
 17 18 than $1 million if the imitation controlled substance is more
 17 19 than 10 kilograms; a class "B" felony punishable by confinement
 17 20 of no more than 25 years and a fine of not less than $5,000 but
 17 21 not more than $100,000 if the imitation controlled substance
 17 22 is more than five kilograms but not more than 10 kilograms; a
 17 23 class "C" felony punishable by a fine of not less than $1,000
 17 24 but not more than $50,000 if the imitation controlled substance
 17 25 is five kilograms or less; or an aggravated misdemeanor if the
 17 26 imitation controlled substance is classified in schedule IV or

 17 28 an aggravated misdemeanor for a second possession offense,
 17 29 or a class "D" felony for two or more previous possession
 17 30 offenses. Current law in Code section 124A.4 provides that if

 18  1 felony.  In addition, under current law, if a person unlawfully
 18  2 and knowingly publishes an advertisement or distributes in a
 18  3 public place a promotion for an imitation controlled substance
 18  4 the person commits a serious misdemeanor.
 18  5    The bill enhances the criminal penalties for controlled
 18  6 substances classified in Code sections 124.204(4)(ai) and
 18  7 124.204(6)(i) from an aggravated misdemeanor to a class "C"
 18  8 felony punishable pursuant to Code section 124.401(1)(c)(8).
 18  9 This change equalizes the criminal penalties with violations
 18 10 involving other schedule I controlled substances.
 18 11    The bill provides that if the same person commits two or
 18 12 more acts which are in violation of Code section 124.401(1)
 18 13 and the acts occur in the same location or time period so the
 18 14 acts are attributable to a single scheme, the acts may be

 18 31 service.
 18 32    The amendments to Code section 124.406 relate to the
 18 33 distribution or possession with the intent to distribute an
 18 34 imitation controlled substance to a person under 18 years of
 18 35 age.  A person who distributes or possesses with the intent to
 19  1 distribute an imitation controlled substance, represented to
 19  2 be a substance listed in schedule I or schedule II, to a person
 19  3 under 18 years of age commits a class "B" felony. The required

 20 11 committing such violations.
 20 12    The bill adds new substances as "hallucinogenic substances"

 20 23 involving the new substances.
 20 24    The bill strikes one substance classified as a
 20 25 "hallucinogenic substance" under schedule I and reclassifies

 20 28 schedule I also changes the criminal penalty for a violation
 20 29 involving the substance from a class "C" felony under Code
 20 30 section 124.401(1)(c)(8) to an aggravated misdemeanor under
 20 31 Code section 124.401(1)(d).  The bill also strikes a substance
 20 32 in Code section 124.204(6)(i)(3) from schedule I and does not
 20 33 reclassify the substance in any other substance schedule.
 20 34    The bill also removes numerous substances from schedule I

 19  5 of 10 years if the substance was distributed within 1,000
 19  6 feet of the real property comprising a public or nonpublic
 19  7 school, public park, public pool, or public recreation center.
 19  8 A person who distributes or possesses with the intent to
 19  9 distribute an imitation controlled substance, represented to be
 19 10 a substance listed in schedule III, to a person under 18 years
 19 11 of age, who is at least three years younger than the violator,
 19 12 commits a class "C" felony.  A person who distributes or
 19 13 possesses with the intent to distribute an imitation controlled
 19 14 substance, represented to be a substance listed in schedule
 19 15 IV or schedule V, to a person under 18 years of age, who is
 19 16 at least three years younger than the violator, commits an
 19 17 aggravated misdemeanor.
 19 18    The amendment to Code section 124.415 requires that a peace
 19 19 officer make a reasonable effort to identify a person under 18
 19 20 years of age discovered to be in possession of an imitation
 19 21 controlled substance, and if the person is not referred to
 19 22 juvenile court, the peace officer shall make a reasonable
 19 23 effort to notify the person's custodial parent of the
 19 24 possession unless the officer has reasonable grounds to believe
 19 25 such notification is not in the best interests of the person.
 19 26 The bill specifies that if the person is taken into custody
 19 27 the juvenile court officer shall make a reasonable effort to
 19 28 identify the school of attendance and to notify the school or
 19 29 nonpublic school of the taking into custody of the person.
 19 30    The bill creates Code section 124.417, which is similar to
 19 31 Code section 124A.5 repealed by the bill.  A person registered
 19 32 under Code section 124.302 does not violate the bill if the
 19 33 person manufactures, delivers, possesses, or possesses with the
 19 34 intent to manufacture or deliver, or acts with others to do
 19 35 such activities, if the person uses the imitation controlled
 20  1 substance for use as a placebo by a registered practitioner in
 20  2 the court of professional practice or research.
 20  3    SCHEDULE I, III, AND IV CONTROLLED SUBSTANCES.  The bill
 20  4 transfers numerous substances classified as "hallucinogenic
 20  5 substances" under schedule I and reclassifies the substances
 20  6 as "other substances" under schedule I.  By transferring the
 20  7 substances to "other substances", a person commits a class "C"
 20  8 felony under Code section 124.401(1)(c)(8) if the violation
 20  9 involves such a substance. Under current law, a person commits
 20 10 an aggravated misdemeanor under Code section 124.401(1)(d) when
 20 11 committing such violations.
 20 12    The bill adds new substances as "hallucinogenic substances"
 20 13 under schedule I.  A person commits a class "C" felony under
 20 14 Code section 124.401(1)(c)(8) if the violation involves the new
 20 15 hallucinogenic substances.
 20 16    The bill adds new substances as "stimulants" under schedule
 20 17 I.  A person commits a class "C" felony under Code section
 20 18 124.401(1)(c)(8) if the violation involves the new stimulant
 20 19 substances.
 20 20    The bill also adds new substances to the classification of
 20 21 "other substances" under schedule I.  A person commits a class
 20 22 "C" felony under Code section 124.401(1)(c)(8) for a violation
 20 23 involving the new substances.
 20 24    The bill strikes one substance classified as a
 20 25 "hallucinogenic substance" under schedule I and reclassifies
 20 26 the substance as a "stimulant" containing a synthetic cathinone
 20 27 under schedule I.  The transfer of the substance within
 20 28 schedule I also changes the criminal penalty for a violation
 20 29 involving the substance from a class "C" felony under Code
 20 30 section 124.401(1)(c)(8) to an aggravated misdemeanor under
 20 31 Code section 124.401(1)(d).  The bill also strikes a substance
 20 32 in Code section 124.204(6)(i)(3) from schedule I and does not
 20 33 reclassify the substance in any other substance schedule.
 20 34    The bill also removes numerous substances from schedule I
 20 35 which are currently classified as "stimulants" in Code section
 21  1 124.204(6)(i).
 21  2    The bill also strikes two narcotic substances from schedule
 21  3 III and adds three substances to schedule IV.  A violation
 21  4 involving a schedule IV controlled substance is punishable as
 21  5 an aggravated misdemeanor in Code section 124.401(1)(d).

 16 25 but by color, shape, size, markings, and other aspects of
 16 26 dosage unit appearance, and packaging or other factors, appears
 16 27 to be or resembles a controlled substance. The board of
 16 28 pharmacy may designate a substance as an imitation controlled
 16 29 substance pursuant to the board's rulemaking authority and in
 16 30 accordance with Code chapter 17A.
 16 31    In addition, under current law and in the bill, if a
 16 32 substance has not been designated as an imitation controlled
 16 33 substance by the board of pharmacy and when dosage unit
 16 34 appearance alone does not establish that a substance is an
 16 35 imitation controlled substance, the following factors may
 17  1 be considered in determining whether the substance is an
 17  2 imitation controlled substance: the substance is represented
 17  3 as having the effect of a controlled substance; the substance
 17  4 is represented as a controlled substance or as a substitute for
 17  5 a controlled substance because of its nature or appearance;
 17  6 or a person receives money or other property having a value
 17  7 substantially greater than the actual value of the substance
 17  8 when sold.
 17  9    Under the bill, if a person unlawfully manufactures,
 17 10 delivers, or possesses with the intent to deliver an imitation
 17 11 controlled substance containing any detectable amount of those
 17 12 substances identified in Code section 124.204(9), or unlawfully
 17 13 acts with, enters into a common scheme or design with, or
 17 14 conspires with one or more persons to manufacture, deliver,
 17 15 or possess such imitation controlled substances, the person
 17 16 commits the following offense: a class "B" felony punishable
 17 17 by confinement of no more than 50 years and a fine of not more
 17 18 than $1 million if the imitation controlled substance is more
 17 19 than 10 kilograms; a class "B" felony punishable by confinement
 17 20 of no more than 25 years and a fine of not less than $5,000 but
 17 21 not more than $100,000 if the imitation controlled substance
 17 22 is more than five kilograms but not more than 10 kilograms; a
 17 23 class "C" felony punishable by a fine of not less than $1,000
 17 24 but not more than $50,000 if the imitation controlled substance
 17 25 is five kilograms or less; or an aggravated misdemeanor if the
 17 26 imitation controlled substance is classified in schedule IV or
 17 27 V; or a serious misdemeanor for a first possession offense,
 17 28 an aggravated misdemeanor for a second possession offense,
 17 29 or a class "D" felony for two or more previous possession
 17 30 offenses. Current law in Code section 124A.4 provides that if
 17 31 a person unlawfully manufactures, delivers, or possesses with
 17 32 intent to deliver an imitation controlled substance, the person
 17 33 commits an aggravated misdemeanor, or if the person delivers
 17 34 to a person under 18 years of age who is at least three years
 17 35 younger than the violator, the person commits a class "D"
 18  1 felony.  In addition, under current law, if a person unlawfully
 18  2 and knowingly publishes an advertisement or distributes in a
 18  3 public place a promotion for an imitation controlled substance
 18  4 the person commits a serious misdemeanor.
 18  5    The bill enhances the criminal penalties for controlled
 18  6 substances classified in Code sections 124.204(4)(ai) and
 18  7 124.204(6)(i) from an aggravated misdemeanor to a class "C"
 18  8 felony punishable pursuant to Code section 124.401(1)(c)(8).
 18  9 This change equalizes the criminal penalties with violations
 18 10 involving other schedule I controlled substances.
 18 11    The bill provides that if the same person commits two or
 18 12 more acts which are in violation of Code section 124.401(1)
 18 13 and the acts occur in the same location or time period so the
 18 14 acts are attributable to a single scheme, the acts may be
 18 15 considered a single violation and the weights of the imitation
 18 16 controlled substance may be combined for purposes of charging
 18 17 the offender.
 18 18    The amendment to Code section 124.401A provides that
 18 19 a person who is 18 years of age or older who unlawfully
 18 20 manufactures with the intent to distribute, distributes,
 18 21 or possesses with the intent to distribute an imitation
 18 22 controlled substance to another person 18 years of age or older
 18 23 within 1,000 feet of the real property comprising a public or

 18 25 confinement of five years in addition to any other penalty.
 18 26    The amendment to Code section 124.401B provides that

 18 29 school, public park, public pool, public recreation center, or
 18 30 marked school bus may be sentenced up to 100 hours of community
 18 31 service.
 18 32    The amendments to Code section 124.406 relate to the
 18 33 distribution or possession with the intent to distribute an
 18 34 imitation controlled substance to a person under 18 years of
 18 35 age.  A person who distributes or possesses with the intent to
 19  1 distribute an imitation controlled substance, represented to
 19  2 be a substance listed in schedule I or schedule II, to a person
 19  3 under 18 years of age commits a class "B" felony. The required
 19  4 penalty for such a violation is a minimum term of confinement
 19  5 of 10 years if the substance was distributed within 1,000
 19  6 feet of the real property comprising a public or nonpublic
 19  7 school, public park, public pool, or public recreation center.
 19  8 A person who distributes or possesses with the intent to
 19  9 distribute an imitation controlled substance, represented to be
 19 10 a substance listed in schedule III, to a person under 18 years
 19 11 of age, who is at least three years younger than the violator,
 19 12 commits a class "C" felony.  A person who distributes or
 19 13 possesses with the intent to distribute an imitation controlled
 19 14 substance, represented to be a substance listed in schedule
 19 15 IV or schedule V, to a person under 18 years of age, who is

 19 21 controlled substance, and if the person is not referred to
 19 22 juvenile court, the peace officer shall make a reasonable
 19 23 effort to notify the person's custodial parent of the
 19 24 possession unless the officer has reasonable grounds to believe
 19 25 such notification is not in the best interests of the person.
 19 26 The bill specifies that if the person is taken into custody
 19 27 the juvenile court officer shall make a reasonable effort to
 19 28 identify the school of attendance and to notify the school or
 19 29 nonpublic school of the taking into custody of the person.
 19 30    The bill creates Code section 124.417, which is similar to
 19 31 Code section 124A.5 repealed by the bill.  A person registered
 19 32 under Code section 124.302 does not violate the bill if the
 19 33 person manufactures, delivers, possesses, or possesses with the
 19 34 intent to manufacture or deliver, or acts with others to do

 20 11 committing such violations.
 20 12    The bill adds new substances as "hallucinogenic substances"

 20 19 substances.
 20 20    The bill also adds new substances to the classification of
 20 21 "other substances" under schedule I.  A person commits a class
 20 22 "C" felony under Code section 124.401(1)(c)(8) for a violation
 20 23 involving the new substances.
 20 24    The bill strikes one substance classified as a

 20 28 schedule I also changes the criminal penalty for a violation
 20 29 involving the substance from a class "C" felony under Code
 20 30 section 124.401(1)(c)(8) to an aggravated misdemeanor under
 20 31 Code section 124.401(1)(d).  The bill also strikes a substance
 20 32 in Code section 124.204(6)(i)(3) from schedule I and does not
 20 33 reclassify the substance in any other substance schedule.
 20 34    The bill also removes numerous substances from schedule I
 20 35 which are currently classified as "stimulants" in Code section
 21  1 124.204(6)(i).
 21  2    The bill also strikes two narcotic substances from schedule

 16 33 substance by the board of pharmacy and when dosage unit
 16 34 appearance alone does not establish that a substance is an
 16 35 imitation controlled substance, the following factors may
 17  1 be considered in determining whether the substance is an
 17  2 imitation controlled substance: the substance is represented
 17  3 as having the effect of a controlled substance; the substance
 17  4 is represented as a controlled substance or as a substitute for
 17  5 a controlled substance because of its nature or appearance;
 17  6 or a person receives money or other property having a value
 17  7 substantially greater than the actual value of the substance
 17  8 when sold.
 17  9    Under the bill, if a person unlawfully manufactures,
 17 10 delivers, or possesses with the intent to deliver an imitation
 17 11 controlled substance containing any detectable amount of those
 17 12 substances identified in Code section 124.204(9), or unlawfully
 17 13 acts with, enters into a common scheme or design with, or
 17 14 conspires with one or more persons to manufacture, deliver,
 17 15 or possess such imitation controlled substances, the person
 17 16 commits the following offense: a class "B" felony punishable
 17 17 by confinement of no more than 50 years and a fine of not more
 17 18 than $1 million if the imitation controlled substance is more
 17 19 than 10 kilograms; a class "B" felony punishable by confinement
 17 20 of no more than 25 years and a fine of not less than $5,000 but
 17 21 not more than $100,000 if the imitation controlled substance
 17 22 is more than five kilograms but not more than 10 kilograms; a
 17 23 class "C" felony punishable by a fine of not less than $1,000
 17 24 but not more than $50,000 if the imitation controlled substance

 17 26 imitation controlled substance is classified in schedule IV or
 17 27 V; or a serious misdemeanor for a first possession offense,
 17 28 an aggravated misdemeanor for a second possession offense,
 17 29 or a class "D" felony for two or more previous possession
 17 30 offenses. Current law in Code section 124A.4 provides that if
 17 31 a person unlawfully manufactures, delivers, or possesses with
 17 32 intent to deliver an imitation controlled substance, the person
 17 33 commits an aggravated misdemeanor, or if the person delivers
 17 34 to a person under 18 years of age who is at least three years
 17 35 younger than the violator, the person commits a class "D"
 18  1 felony.  In addition, under current law, if a person unlawfully
 18  2 and knowingly publishes an advertisement or distributes in a
 18  3 public place a promotion for an imitation controlled substance
 18  4 the person commits a serious misdemeanor.
 18  5    The bill enhances the criminal penalties for controlled
 18  6 substances classified in Code sections 124.204(4)(ai) and
 18  7 124.204(6)(i) from an aggravated misdemeanor to a class "C"
 18  8 felony punishable pursuant to Code section 124.401(1)(c)(8).
 18  9 This change equalizes the criminal penalties with violations
 18 10 involving other schedule I controlled substances.
 18 11    The bill provides that if the same person commits two or
 18 12 more acts which are in violation of Code section 124.401(1)
 18 13 and the acts occur in the same location or time period so the
 18 14 acts are attributable to a single scheme, the acts may be
 18 15 considered a single violation and the weights of the imitation
 18 16 controlled substance may be combined for purposes of charging
 18 17 the offender.
 18 18    The amendment to Code section 124.401A provides that
 18 19 a person who is 18 years of age or older who unlawfully
 18 20 manufactures with the intent to distribute, distributes,
 18 21 or possesses with the intent to distribute an imitation
 18 22 controlled substance to another person 18 years of age or older
 18 23 within 1,000 feet of the real property comprising a public or
 18 24 nonpublic school, may be sentenced up to an additional term of
 18 25 confinement of five years in addition to any other penalty.
 18 26    The amendment to Code section 124.401B provides that
 18 27 a person who unlawfully possesses an imitation controlled
 18 28 substance within 1,000 feet of the real property comprising a
 18 29 school, public park, public pool, public recreation center, or
 18 30 marked school bus may be sentenced up to 100 hours of community
 18 31 service.
 18 32    The amendments to Code section 124.406 relate to the
 18 33 distribution or possession with the intent to distribute an
 18 34 imitation controlled substance to a person under 18 years of
 18 35 age.  A person who distributes or possesses with the intent to
 19  1 distribute an imitation controlled substance, represented to
 19  2 be a substance listed in schedule I or schedule II, to a person
 19  3 under 18 years of age commits a class "B" felony. The required
 19  4 penalty for such a violation is a minimum term of confinement
 19  5 of 10 years if the substance was distributed within 1,000
 19  6 feet of the real property comprising a public or nonpublic
 19  7 school, public park, public pool, or public recreation center.
 19  8 A person who distributes or possesses with the intent to
 19  9 distribute an imitation controlled substance, represented to be
 19 10 a substance listed in schedule III, to a person under 18 years
 19 11 of age, who is at least three years younger than the violator,
 19 12 commits a class "C" felony.  A person who distributes or
 19 13 possesses with the intent to distribute an imitation controlled
 19 14 substance, represented to be a substance listed in schedule
 19 15 IV or schedule V, to a person under 18 years of age, who is
 19 16 at least three years younger than the violator, commits an
 19 17 aggravated misdemeanor.
 19 18    The amendment to Code section 124.415 requires that a peace
 19 19 officer make a reasonable effort to identify a person under 18
 19 20 years of age discovered to be in possession of an imitation
 19 21 controlled substance, and if the person is not referred to
 19 22 juvenile court, the peace officer shall make a reasonable
 19 23 effort to notify the person's custodial parent of the
 19 24 possession unless the officer has reasonable grounds to believe
 19 25 such notification is not in the best interests of the person.
 19 26 The bill specifies that if the person is taken into custody
 19 27 the juvenile court officer shall make a reasonable effort to
 19 28 identify the school of attendance and to notify the school or
 19 29 nonpublic school of the taking into custody of the person.
 19 30    The bill creates Code section 124.417, which is similar to
 19 31 Code section 124A.5 repealed by the bill.  A person registered
 19 32 under Code section 124.302 does not violate the bill if the
 19 33 person manufactures, delivers, possesses, or possesses with the
 19 34 intent to manufacture or deliver, or acts with others to do
 19 35 such activities, if the person uses the imitation controlled
 20  1 substance for use as a placebo by a registered practitioner in
 20  2 the court of professional practice or research.
 20  3    SCHEDULE I, III, AND IV CONTROLLED SUBSTANCES.  The bill
 20  4 transfers numerous substances classified as "hallucinogenic
 20  5 substances" under schedule I and reclassifies the substances
 20  6 as "other substances" under schedule I.  By transferring the
 20  7 substances to "other substances", a person commits a class "C"
 20  8 felony under Code section 124.401(1)(c)(8) if the violation
 20  9 involves such a substance. Under current law, a person commits
 20 10 an aggravated misdemeanor under Code section 124.401(1)(d) when
 20 11 committing such violations.
 20 12    The bill adds new substances as "hallucinogenic substances"
 20 13 under schedule I.  A person commits a class "C" felony under
 20 14 Code section 124.401(1)(c)(8) if the violation involves the new
 20 15 hallucinogenic substances.
 20 16    The bill adds new substances as "stimulants" under schedule
 20 17 I.  A person commits a class "C" felony under Code section
 20 18 124.401(1)(c)(8) if the violation involves the new stimulant
 20 19 substances.
 20 20    The bill also adds new substances to the classification of
 20 21 "other substances" under schedule I.  A person commits a class
 20 22 "C" felony under Code section 124.401(1)(c)(8) for a violation
 20 23 involving the new substances.
 20 24    The bill strikes one substance classified as a
 20 25 "hallucinogenic substance" under schedule I and reclassifies
 20 26 the substance as a "stimulant" containing a synthetic cathinone
 20 27 under schedule I.  The transfer of the substance within
 20 28 schedule I also changes the criminal penalty for a violation
 20 29 involving the substance from a class "C" felony under Code
 20 30 section 124.401(1)(c)(8) to an aggravated misdemeanor under
 20 31 Code section 124.401(1)(d).  The bill also strikes a substance
 20 32 in Code section 124.204(6)(i)(3) from schedule I and does not
 20 33 reclassify the substance in any other substance schedule.
 20 34    The bill also removes numerous substances from schedule I
 20 35 which are currently classified as "stimulants" in Code section
 21  1 124.204(6)(i).
 21  2    The bill also strikes two narcotic substances from schedule
 21  3 III and adds three substances to schedule IV.  A violation
 21  4 involving a schedule IV controlled substance is punishable as
 21  5 an aggravated misdemeanor in Code section 124.401(1)(d).

 19 18    The amendment to Code section 124.415 requires that a peace
 19 19 officer make a reasonable effort to identify a person under 18
 19 20 years of age discovered to be in possession of an imitation
 19 21 controlled substance, and if the person is not referred to
 19 22 juvenile court, the peace officer shall make a reasonable
 19 23 effort to notify the person's custodial parent of the
 19 24 possession unless the officer has reasonable grounds to believe
 19 25 such notification is not in the best interests of the person.

 19 27 the juvenile court officer shall make a reasonable effort to
 19 28 identify the school of attendance and to notify the school or
 19 29 nonpublic school of the taking into custody of the person.
 19 30    The bill creates Code section 124.417, which is similar to
 19 31 Code section 124A.5 repealed by the bill.  A person registered
 19 32 under Code section 124.302 does not violate the bill if the
 19 33 person manufactures, delivers, possesses, or possesses with the
 19 34 intent to manufacture or deliver, or acts with others to do
 19 35 such activities, if the person uses the imitation controlled
 20  1 substance for use as a placebo by a registered practitioner in
 20  2 the court of professional practice or research.
 20  3    SCHEDULE I, III, AND IV CONTROLLED SUBSTANCES.  The bill
 20  4 transfers numerous substances classified as "hallucinogenic
 20  5 substances" under schedule I and reclassifies the substances
 20  6 as "other substances" under schedule I.  By transferring the
 20  7 substances to "other substances", a person commits a class "C"
 20  8 felony under Code section 124.401(1)(c)(8) if the violation
 20  9 involves such a substance. Under current law, a person commits
 20 10 an aggravated misdemeanor under Code section 124.401(1)(d) when
 20 11 committing such violations.
 20 12    The bill adds new substances as "hallucinogenic substances"
 20 13 under schedule I.  A person commits a class "C" felony under

 20 19 substances.
 20 20    The bill also adds new substances to the classification of
 20 21 "other substances" under schedule I.  A person commits a class
 20 22 "C" felony under Code section 124.401(1)(c)(8) for a violation
 20 23 involving the new substances.
 20 24    The bill strikes one substance classified as a
 20 25 "hallucinogenic substance" under schedule I and reclassifies
 20 26 the substance as a "stimulant" containing a synthetic cathinone
 20 27 under schedule I.  The transfer of the substance within
 20 28 schedule I also changes the criminal penalty for a violation
 20 29 involving the substance from a class "C" felony under Code
 20 30 section 124.401(1)(c)(8) to an aggravated misdemeanor under
 20 31 Code section 124.401(1)(d).  The bill also strikes a substance
 20 32 in Code section 124.204(6)(i)(3) from schedule I and does not
 20 33 reclassify the substance in any other substance schedule.
 20 34    The bill also removes numerous substances from schedule I
 20 35 which are currently classified as "stimulants" in Code section
 21  1 124.204(6)(i).
 21  2    The bill also strikes two narcotic substances from schedule
 21  3 III and adds three substances to schedule IV.  A violation
 21  4 involving a schedule IV controlled substance is punishable as

 16 31    In addition, under current law and in the bill, if a
 16 32 substance has not been designated as an imitation controlled
 16 33 substance by the board of pharmacy and when dosage unit
 16 34 appearance alone does not establish that a substance is an
 16 35 imitation controlled substance, the following factors may
 17  1 be considered in determining whether the substance is an
 17  2 imitation controlled substance: the substance is represented
 17  3 as having the effect of a controlled substance; the substance
 17  4 is represented as a controlled substance or as a substitute for
 17  5 a controlled substance because of its nature or appearance;
 17  6 or a person receives money or other property having a value
 17  7 substantially greater than the actual value of the substance
 17  8 when sold.
 17  9    Under the bill, if a person unlawfully manufactures,
 17 10 delivers, or possesses with the intent to deliver an imitation
 17 11 controlled substance containing any detectable amount of those

 17 13 acts with, enters into a common scheme or design with, or
 17 14 conspires with one or more persons to manufacture, deliver,
 17 15 or possess such imitation controlled substances, the person
 17 16 commits the following offense: a class "B" felony punishable
 17 17 by confinement of no more than 50 years and a fine of not more
 17 18 than $1 million if the imitation controlled substance is more
 17 19 than 10 kilograms; a class "B" felony punishable by confinement
 17 20 of no more than 25 years and a fine of not less than $5,000 but
 17 21 not more than $100,000 if the imitation controlled substance

 17 23 class "C" felony punishable by a fine of not less than $1,000
 17 24 but not more than $50,000 if the imitation controlled substance
 17 25 is five kilograms or less; or an aggravated misdemeanor if the
 17 26 imitation controlled substance is classified in schedule IV or
 17 27 V; or a serious misdemeanor for a first possession offense,
 17 28 an aggravated misdemeanor for a second possession offense,
 17 29 or a class "D" felony for two or more previous possession
 17 30 offenses. Current law in Code section 124A.4 provides that if
 17 31 a person unlawfully manufactures, delivers, or possesses with
 17 32 intent to deliver an imitation controlled substance, the person
 17 33 commits an aggravated misdemeanor, or if the person delivers
 17 34 to a person under 18 years of age who is at least three years
 17 35 younger than the violator, the person commits a class "D"

 18  4 the person commits a serious misdemeanor.
 18  5    The bill enhances the criminal penalties for controlled
 18  6 substances classified in Code sections 124.204(4)(ai) and
 18  7 124.204(6)(i) from an aggravated misdemeanor to a class "C"
 18  8 felony punishable pursuant to Code section 124.401(1)(c)(8).
 18  9 This change equalizes the criminal penalties with violations
 18 10 involving other schedule I controlled substances.
 18 11    The bill provides that if the same person commits two or
 18 12 more acts which are in violation of Code section 124.401(1)
 18 13 and the acts occur in the same location or time period so the
 18 14 acts are attributable to a single scheme, the acts may be
 18 15 considered a single violation and the weights of the imitation
 18 16 controlled substance may be combined for purposes of charging
 18 17 the offender.
 18 18    The amendment to Code section 124.401A provides that
 18 19 a person who is 18 years of age or older who unlawfully
 18 20 manufactures with the intent to distribute, distributes,
 18 21 or possesses with the intent to distribute an imitation
 18 22 controlled substance to another person 18 years of age or older
 18 23 within 1,000 feet of the real property comprising a public or

 19  1 distribute an imitation controlled substance, represented to
 19  2 be a substance listed in schedule I or schedule II, to a person
 19  3 under 18 years of age commits a class "B" felony. The required
 19  4 penalty for such a violation is a minimum term of confinement
 19  5 of 10 years if the substance was distributed within 1,000

 17 28 an aggravated misdemeanor for a second possession offense,
 17 29 or a class "D" felony for two or more previous possession
 17 30 offenses. Current law in Code section 124A.4 provides that if
 17 31 a person unlawfully manufactures, delivers, or possesses with
 17 32 intent to deliver an imitation controlled substance, the person
 17 33 commits an aggravated misdemeanor, or if the person delivers
 17 34 to a person under 18 years of age who is at least three years
 17 35 younger than the violator, the person commits a class "D"
 18  1 felony.  In addition, under current law, if a person unlawfully
 18  2 and knowingly publishes an advertisement or distributes in a
 18  3 public place a promotion for an imitation controlled substance

 18  5    The bill enhances the criminal penalties for controlled
 18  6 substances classified in Code sections 124.204(4)(ai) and
 18  7 124.204(6)(i) from an aggravated misdemeanor to a class "C"
 18  8 felony punishable pursuant to Code section 124.401(1)(c)(8).
 18  9 This change equalizes the criminal penalties with violations
 18 10 involving other schedule I controlled substances.
 18 11    The bill provides that if the same person commits two or
 18 12 more acts which are in violation of Code section 124.401(1)
 18 13 and the acts occur in the same location or time period so the
 18 14 acts are attributable to a single scheme, the acts may be
 18 15 considered a single violation and the weights of the imitation
 18 16 controlled substance may be combined for purposes of charging
 18 17 the offender.
 18 18    The amendment to Code section 124.401A provides that
 18 19 a person who is 18 years of age or older who unlawfully

 18 22 controlled substance to another person 18 years of age or older
 18 23 within 1,000 feet of the real property comprising a public or
 18 24 nonpublic school, may be sentenced up to an additional term of
 18 25 confinement of five years in addition to any other penalty.
 18 26    The amendment to Code section 124.401B provides that
 18 27 a person who unlawfully possesses an imitation controlled
 18 28 substance within 1,000 feet of the real property comprising a
 18 29 school, public park, public pool, public recreation center, or
 18 30 marked school bus may be sentenced up to 100 hours of community
 18 31 service.
 18 32    The amendments to Code section 124.406 relate to the
 18 33 distribution or possession with the intent to distribute an
 18 34 imitation controlled substance to a person under 18 years of
 18 35 age.  A person who distributes or possesses with the intent to
 19  1 distribute an imitation controlled substance, represented to
 19  2 be a substance listed in schedule I or schedule II, to a person
 19  3 under 18 years of age commits a class "B" felony. The required
 19  4 penalty for such a violation is a minimum term of confinement
 19  5 of 10 years if the substance was distributed within 1,000
 19  6 feet of the real property comprising a public or nonpublic

 19 18    The amendment to Code section 124.415 requires that a peace
 19 19 officer make a reasonable effort to identify a person under 18
 19 20 years of age discovered to be in possession of an imitation
 19 21 controlled substance, and if the person is not referred to
 19 22 juvenile court, the peace officer shall make a reasonable
 19 23 effort to notify the person's custodial parent of the
 19 24 possession unless the officer has reasonable grounds to believe
 19 25 such notification is not in the best interests of the person.
 19 26 The bill specifies that if the person is taken into custody
 19 27 the juvenile court officer shall make a reasonable effort to
 19 28 identify the school of attendance and to notify the school or
 19 29 nonpublic school of the taking into custody of the person.
 19 30    The bill creates Code section 124.417, which is similar to
 19 31 Code section 124A.5 repealed by the bill.  A person registered
 19 32 under Code section 124.302 does not violate the bill if the
 19 33 person manufactures, delivers, possesses, or possesses with the
 19 34 intent to manufacture or deliver, or acts with others to do
 19 35 such activities, if the person uses the imitation controlled
 20  1 substance for use as a placebo by a registered practitioner in
 20  2 the court of professional practice or research.
 20  3    SCHEDULE I, III, AND IV CONTROLLED SUBSTANCES.  The bill
 20  4 transfers numerous substances classified as "hallucinogenic
 20  5 substances" under schedule I and reclassifies the substances
 20  6 as "other substances" under schedule I.  By transferring the
 20  7 substances to "other substances", a person commits a class "C"
 20  8 felony under Code section 124.401(1)(c)(8) if the violation
 20  9 involves such a substance. Under current law, a person commits
 20 10 an aggravated misdemeanor under Code section 124.401(1)(d) when
 20 11 committing such violations.
 20 12    The bill adds new substances as "hallucinogenic substances"

 20 19 substances.
 20 20    The bill also adds new substances to the classification of
 20 21 "other substances" under schedule I.  A person commits a class
 20 22 "C" felony under Code section 124.401(1)(c)(8) for a violation
 20 23 involving the new substances.
 20 24    The bill strikes one substance classified as a
 20 25 "hallucinogenic substance" under schedule I and reclassifies
 20 26 the substance as a "stimulant" containing a synthetic cathinone
 20 27 under schedule I.  The transfer of the substance within
 20 28 schedule I also changes the criminal penalty for a violation
 20 29 involving the substance from a class "C" felony under Code
 20 30 section 124.401(1)(c)(8) to an aggravated misdemeanor under
 20 31 Code section 124.401(1)(d).  The bill also strikes a substance
 20 32 in Code section 124.204(6)(i)(3) from schedule I and does not
 20 33 reclassify the substance in any other substance schedule.
 20 34    The bill also removes numerous substances from schedule I
 20 35 which are currently classified as "stimulants" in Code section
 21  1 124.204(6)(i).
 21  2    The bill also strikes two narcotic substances from schedule
 21  3 III and adds three substances to schedule IV.  A violation
 21  4 involving a schedule IV controlled substance is punishable as
 21  5 an aggravated misdemeanor in Code section 124.401(1)(d).

 19 21 controlled substance, and if the person is not referred to
 19 22 juvenile court, the peace officer shall make a reasonable

 19 30    The bill creates Code section 124.417, which is similar to
 19 31 Code section 124A.5 repealed by the bill.  A person registered
 19 32 under Code section 124.302 does not violate the bill if the
 19 33 person manufactures, delivers, possesses, or possesses with the
 19 34 intent to manufacture or deliver, or acts with others to do
 19 35 such activities, if the person uses the imitation controlled
 20  1 substance for use as a placebo by a registered practitioner in

 20  7 substances to "other substances", a person commits a class "C"
 20  8 felony under Code section 124.401(1)(c)(8) if the violation
 20  9 involves such a substance. Under current law, a person commits

 20 11 committing such violations.
 20 12    The bill adds new substances as "hallucinogenic substances"

 20 23 involving the new substances.
 20 24    The bill strikes one substance classified as a
 20 25 "hallucinogenic substance" under schedule I and reclassifies
 20 26 the substance as a "stimulant" containing a synthetic cathinone

 20 30 section 124.401(1)(c)(8) to an aggravated misdemeanor under
 20 31 Code section 124.401(1)(d).  The bill also strikes a substance

 17  9    Under the bill, if a person unlawfully manufactures,

 17 13 acts with, enters into a common scheme or design with, or
 17 14 conspires with one or more persons to manufacture, deliver,
 17 15 or possess such imitation controlled substances, the person
 17 16 commits the following offense: a class "B" felony punishable

 17 28 an aggravated misdemeanor for a second possession offense,
 17 29 or a class "D" felony for two or more previous possession
 17 30 offenses. Current law in Code section 124A.4 provides that if
 17 31 a person unlawfully manufactures, delivers, or possesses with
 17 32 intent to deliver an imitation controlled substance, the person
 17 33 commits an aggravated misdemeanor, or if the person delivers
 17 34 to a person under 18 years of age who is at least three years
 17 35 younger than the violator, the person commits a class "D"
 18  1 felony.  In addition, under current law, if a person unlawfully
 18  2 and knowingly publishes an advertisement or distributes in a
 18  3 public place a promotion for an imitation controlled substance
 18  4 the person commits a serious misdemeanor.
 18  5    The bill enhances the criminal penalties for controlled
 18  6 substances classified in Code sections 124.204(4)(ai) and
 18  7 124.204(6)(i) from an aggravated misdemeanor to a class "C"

 18 13 and the acts occur in the same location or time period so the
 18 14 acts are attributable to a single scheme, the acts may be
 18 15 considered a single violation and the weights of the imitation
 18 16 controlled substance may be combined for purposes of charging
 18 17 the offender.

 19 30    The bill creates Code section 124.417, which is similar to
 19 31 Code section 124A.5 repealed by the bill.  A person registered

 17 13 acts with, enters into a common scheme or design with, or
 17 14 conspires with one or more persons to manufacture, deliver,
 17 15 or possess such imitation controlled substances, the person
 17 16 commits the following offense: a class "B" felony punishable
 17 17 by confinement of no more than 50 years and a fine of not more
 17 18 than $1 million if the imitation controlled substance is more
 17 19 than 10 kilograms; a class "B" felony punishable by confinement
 17 20 of no more than 25 years and a fine of not less than $5,000 but

 17 33 commits an aggravated misdemeanor, or if the person delivers
 17 34 to a person under 18 years of age who is at least three years
 17 35 younger than the violator, the person commits a class "D"

 18 13 and the acts occur in the same location or time period so the
 18 14 acts are attributable to a single scheme, the acts may be

 18 33 distribution or possession with the intent to distribute an
 18 34 imitation controlled substance to a person under 18 years of
 18 35 age.  A person who distributes or possesses with the intent to
 19  1 distribute an imitation controlled substance, represented to
 19  2 be a substance listed in schedule I or schedule II, to a person
 19  3 under 18 years of age commits a class "B" felony. The required
 19  4 penalty for such a violation is a minimum term of confinement
 19  5 of 10 years if the substance was distributed within 1,000

 19 33 person manufactures, delivers, possesses, or possesses with the
 19 34 intent to manufacture or deliver, or acts with others to do

 20  7 substances to "other substances", a person commits a class "C"
 20  8 felony under Code section 124.401(1)(c)(8) if the violation
 20  9 involves such a substance. Under current law, a person commits
 20 10 an aggravated misdemeanor under Code section 124.401(1)(d) when
 20 11 committing such violations.
 20 12    The bill adds new substances as "hallucinogenic substances"

 20 19 substances.
 20 20    The bill also adds new substances to the classification of

 20 23 involving the new substances.
 20 24    The bill strikes one substance classified as a
 20 25 "hallucinogenic substance" under schedule I and reclassifies
 20 26 the substance as a "stimulant" containing a synthetic cathinone
 20 27 under schedule I.  The transfer of the substance within
 20 28 schedule I also changes the criminal penalty for a violation
 20 29 involving the substance from a class "C" felony under Code
 20 30 section 124.401(1)(c)(8) to an aggravated misdemeanor under

 19 19 officer make a reasonable effort to identify a person under 18
 19 20 years of age discovered to be in possession of an imitation
 19 21 controlled substance, and if the person is not referred to
 19 22 juvenile court, the peace officer shall make a reasonable
 19 23 effort to notify the person's custodial parent of the
 19 24 possession unless the officer has reasonable grounds to believe
 19 25 such notification is not in the best interests of the person.
 19 26 The bill specifies that if the person is taken into custody
 19 27 the juvenile court officer shall make a reasonable effort to
 19 28 identify the school of attendance and to notify the school or
 19 29 nonpublic school of the taking into custody of the person.
 19 30    The bill creates Code section 124.417, which is similar to
 19 31 Code section 124A.5 repealed by the bill.  A person registered
 19 32 under Code section 124.302 does not violate the bill if the
 19 33 person manufactures, delivers, possesses, or possesses with the
 19 34 intent to manufacture or deliver, or acts with others to do

 20  4 transfers numerous substances classified as "hallucinogenic
 20  5 substances" under schedule I and reclassifies the substances
 20  6 as "other substances" under schedule I.  By transferring the
 20  7 substances to "other substances", a person commits a class "C"
 20  8 felony under Code section 124.401(1)(c)(8) if the violation
 20  9 involves such a substance. Under current law, a person commits
 20 10 an aggravated misdemeanor under Code section 124.401(1)(d) when
 20 11 committing such violations.
 20 12    The bill adds new substances as "hallucinogenic substances"

 20 19 substances.
 20 20    The bill also adds new substances to the classification of
 20 21 "other substances" under schedule I.  A person commits a class
 20 22 "C" felony under Code section 124.401(1)(c)(8) for a violation
 20 23 involving the new substances.
 20 24    The bill strikes one substance classified as a
 20 25 "hallucinogenic substance" under schedule I and reclassifies
 20 26 the substance as a "stimulant" containing a synthetic cathinone
 20 27 under schedule I.  The transfer of the substance within
 20 28 schedule I also changes the criminal penalty for a violation
 20 29 involving the substance from a class "C" felony under Code
 20 30 section 124.401(1)(c)(8) to an aggravated misdemeanor under
 20 31 Code section 124.401(1)(d).  The bill also strikes a substance
 20 32 in Code section 124.204(6)(i)(3) from schedule I and does not
 20 33 reclassify the substance in any other substance schedule.
 20 34    The bill also removes numerous substances from schedule I
 20 35 which are currently classified as "stimulants" in Code section
 21  1 124.204(6)(i).
 21  2    The bill also strikes two narcotic substances from schedule
 21  3 III and adds three substances to schedule IV.  A violation
 21  4 involving a schedule IV controlled substance is punishable as
 21  5 an aggravated misdemeanor in Code section 124.401(1)(d).

 19 18    The amendment to Code section 124.415 requires that a peace
 19 19 officer make a reasonable effort to identify a person under 18

 19 21 controlled substance, and if the person is not referred to
 19 22 juvenile court, the peace officer shall make a reasonable
 19 23 effort to notify the person's custodial parent of the
 19 24 possession unless the officer has reasonable grounds to believe
 19 25 such notification is not in the best interests of the person.

 19 27 the juvenile court officer shall make a reasonable effort to
 19 28 identify the school of attendance and to notify the school or

 20  7 substances to "other substances", a person commits a class "C"
 20  8 felony under Code section 124.401(1)(c)(8) if the violation
 20  9 involves such a substance. Under current law, a person commits
 20 10 an aggravated misdemeanor under Code section 124.401(1)(d) when
 20 11 committing such violations.
 20 12    The bill adds new substances as "hallucinogenic substances"

 20 19 substances.
 20 20    The bill also adds new substances to the classification of

 20 23 involving the new substances.
 20 24    The bill strikes one substance classified as a
 20 25 "hallucinogenic substance" under schedule I and reclassifies
 20 26 the substance as a "stimulant" containing a synthetic cathinone
 20 27 under schedule I.  The transfer of the substance within
 20 28 schedule I also changes the criminal penalty for a violation
 20 29 involving the substance from a class "C" felony under Code
 20 30 section 124.401(1)(c)(8) to an aggravated misdemeanor under
 20 31 Code section 124.401(1)(d).  The bill also strikes a substance
 20 32 in Code section 124.204(6)(i)(3) from schedule I and does not
 20 33 reclassify the substance in any other substance schedule.
 20 34    The bill also removes numerous substances from schedule I
 20 35 which are currently classified as "stimulants" in Code section
 21  1 124.204(6)(i).
 21  2    The bill also strikes two narcotic substances from schedule

 18 14 acts are attributable to a single scheme, the acts may be

 19  6 feet of the real property comprising a public or nonpublic
 19  7 school, public park, public pool, or public recreation center.
 19  8 A person who distributes or possesses with the intent to
 19  9 distribute an imitation controlled substance, represented to be
 19 10 a substance listed in schedule III, to a person under 18 years
 19 11 of age, who is at least three years younger than the violator,
 19 12 commits a class "C" felony.  A person who distributes or

 19 14 substance, represented to be a substance listed in schedule
 19 15 IV or schedule V, to a person under 18 years of age, who is
 19 16 at least three years younger than the violator, commits an
 19 17 aggravated misdemeanor.
 19 18    The amendment to Code section 124.415 requires that a peace
 19 19 officer make a reasonable effort to identify a person under 18
 19 20 years of age discovered to be in possession of an imitation
 19 21 controlled substance, and if the person is not referred to
 19 22 juvenile court, the peace officer shall make a reasonable
 19 23 effort to notify the person's custodial parent of the
 19 24 possession unless the officer has reasonable grounds to believe
 19 25 such notification is not in the best interests of the person.
 19 26 The bill specifies that if the person is taken into custody
 19 27 the juvenile court officer shall make a reasonable effort to
 19 28 identify the school of attendance and to notify the school or
 19 29 nonpublic school of the taking into custody of the person.
 19 30    The bill creates Code section 124.417, which is similar to
 19 31 Code section 124A.5 repealed by the bill.  A person registered
 19 32 under Code section 124.302 does not violate the bill if the
 19 33 person manufactures, delivers, possesses, or possesses with the
 19 34 intent to manufacture or deliver, or acts with others to do
 19 35 such activities, if the person uses the imitation controlled
 20  1 substance for use as a placebo by a registered practitioner in
 20  2 the court of professional practice or research.
 20  3    SCHEDULE I, III, AND IV CONTROLLED SUBSTANCES.  The bill
 20  4 transfers numerous substances classified as "hallucinogenic
 20  5 substances" under schedule I and reclassifies the substances
 20  6 as "other substances" under schedule I.  By transferring the
 20  7 substances to "other substances", a person commits a class "C"
 20  8 felony under Code section 124.401(1)(c)(8) if the violation
 20  9 involves such a substance. Under current law, a person commits
 20 10 an aggravated misdemeanor under Code section 124.401(1)(d) when
 20 11 committing such violations.
 20 12    The bill adds new substances as "hallucinogenic substances"
 20 13 under schedule I.  A person commits a class "C" felony under

 20 15 hallucinogenic substances.
 20 16    The bill adds new substances as "stimulants" under schedule
 20 17 I.  A person commits a class "C" felony under Code section
 20 18 124.401(1)(c)(8) if the violation involves the new stimulant
 20 19 substances.
 20 20    The bill also adds new substances to the classification of
 20 21 "other substances" under schedule I.  A person commits a class
 20 22 "C" felony under Code section 124.401(1)(c)(8) for a violation
 20 23 involving the new substances.
 20 24    The bill strikes one substance classified as a
 20 25 "hallucinogenic substance" under schedule I and reclassifies
 20 26 the substance as a "stimulant" containing a synthetic cathinone
 20 27 under schedule I.  The transfer of the substance within
 20 28 schedule I also changes the criminal penalty for a violation
 20 29 involving the substance from a class "C" felony under Code
 20 30 section 124.401(1)(c)(8) to an aggravated misdemeanor under
 20 31 Code section 124.401(1)(d).  The bill also strikes a substance
 20 32 in Code section 124.204(6)(i)(3) from schedule I and does not
 20 33 reclassify the substance in any other substance schedule.
 20 34    The bill also removes numerous substances from schedule I
 20 35 which are currently classified as "stimulants" in Code section
 21  1 124.204(6)(i).
 21  2    The bill also strikes two narcotic substances from schedule
 21  3 III and adds three substances to schedule IV.  A violation
 21  4 involving a schedule IV controlled substance is punishable as

 17 33 commits an aggravated misdemeanor, or if the person delivers
 17 34 to a person under 18 years of age who is at least three years
 17 35 younger than the violator, the person commits a class "D"

 19 15 IV or schedule V, to a person under 18 years of age, who is
 19 16 at least three years younger than the violator, commits an
 19 17 aggravated misdemeanor.
 19 18    The amendment to Code section 124.415 requires that a peace
 19 19 officer make a reasonable effort to identify a person under 18
 19 20 years of age discovered to be in possession of an imitation
 19 21 controlled substance, and if the person is not referred to
 19 22 juvenile court, the peace officer shall make a reasonable
 19 23 effort to notify the person's custodial parent of the
 19 24 possession unless the officer has reasonable grounds to believe
 19 25 such notification is not in the best interests of the person.

 19 27 the juvenile court officer shall make a reasonable effort to
 19 28 identify the school of attendance and to notify the school or

 19 30    The bill creates Code section 124.417, which is similar to
 19 31 Code section 124A.5 repealed by the bill.  A person registered
 19 32 under Code section 124.302 does not violate the bill if the
 19 33 person manufactures, delivers, possesses, or possesses with the
 19 34 intent to manufacture or deliver, or acts with others to do
 19 35 such activities, if the person uses the imitation controlled
 20  1 substance for use as a placebo by a registered practitioner in
 20  2 the court of professional practice or research.
 20  3    SCHEDULE I, III, AND IV CONTROLLED SUBSTANCES.  The bill
 20  4 transfers numerous substances classified as "hallucinogenic
 20  5 substances" under schedule I and reclassifies the substances
 20  6 as "other substances" under schedule I.  By transferring the
 20  7 substances to "other substances", a person commits a class "C"
 20  8 felony under Code section 124.401(1)(c)(8) if the violation
 20  9 involves such a substance. Under current law, a person commits
 20 10 an aggravated misdemeanor under Code section 124.401(1)(d) when
 20 11 committing such violations.
 20 12    The bill adds new substances as "hallucinogenic substances"
 20 13 under schedule I.  A person commits a class "C" felony under

 20 15 hallucinogenic substances.
 20 16    The bill adds new substances as "stimulants" under schedule

 20 19 substances.
 20 20    The bill also adds new substances to the classification of
 20 21 "other substances" under schedule I.  A person commits a class
 20 22 "C" felony under Code section 124.401(1)(c)(8) for a violation
 20 23 involving the new substances.
 20 24    The bill strikes one substance classified as a
 20 25 "hallucinogenic substance" under schedule I and reclassifies
 20 26 the substance as a "stimulant" containing a synthetic cathinone
 20 27 under schedule I.  The transfer of the substance within
 20 28 schedule I also changes the criminal penalty for a violation
 20 29 involving the substance from a class "C" felony under Code
 20 30 section 124.401(1)(c)(8) to an aggravated misdemeanor under
 20 31 Code section 124.401(1)(d).  The bill also strikes a substance
 20 32 in Code section 124.204(6)(i)(3) from schedule I and does not
 20 33 reclassify the substance in any other substance schedule.
 20 34    The bill also removes numerous substances from schedule I
 20 35 which are currently classified as "stimulants" in Code section
 21  1 124.204(6)(i).
 21  2    The bill also strikes two narcotic substances from schedule
 21  3 III and adds three substances to schedule IV.  A violation
 21  4 involving a schedule IV controlled substance is punishable as
 21  5 an aggravated misdemeanor in Code section 124.401(1)(d).

 17 28 an aggravated misdemeanor for a second possession offense,
 17 29 or a class "D" felony for two or more previous possession
 17 30 offenses. Current law in Code section 124A.4 provides that if
 17 31 a person unlawfully manufactures, delivers, or possesses with
 17 32 intent to deliver an imitation controlled substance, the person
 17 33 commits an aggravated misdemeanor, or if the person delivers
 17 34 to a person under 18 years of age who is at least three years
 17 35 younger than the violator, the person commits a class "D"
 18  1 felony.  In addition, under current law, if a person unlawfully
 18  2 and knowingly publishes an advertisement or distributes in a
 18  3 public place a promotion for an imitation controlled substance
 18  4 the person commits a serious misdemeanor.

 18 12 more acts which are in violation of Code section 124.401(1)
 18 13 and the acts occur in the same location or time period so the
 18 14 acts are attributable to a single scheme, the acts may be
 18 15 considered a single violation and the weights of the imitation
 18 16 controlled substance may be combined for purposes of charging
 18 17 the offender.

 18 21 or possesses with the intent to distribute an imitation
 18 22 controlled substance to another person 18 years of age or older

 20  3    SCHEDULE I, III, AND IV CONTROLLED SUBSTANCES.  The bill
 20  4 transfers numerous substances classified as "hallucinogenic
 20  5 substances" under schedule I and reclassifies the substances
 20  6 as "other substances" under schedule I.  By transferring the
 20  7 substances to "other substances", a person commits a class "C"
 20  8 felony under Code section 124.401(1)(c)(8) if the violation
 20  9 involves such a substance. Under current law, a person commits
 20 10 an aggravated misdemeanor under Code section 124.401(1)(d) when
 20 11 committing such violations.
 20 12    The bill adds new substances as "hallucinogenic substances"
 20 13 under schedule I.  A person commits a class "C" felony under

 20 19 substances.
 20 20    The bill also adds new substances to the classification of

 20 23 involving the new substances.
 20 24    The bill strikes one substance classified as a
 20 25 "hallucinogenic substance" under schedule I and reclassifies
 20 26 the substance as a "stimulant" containing a synthetic cathinone
 20 27 under schedule I.  The transfer of the substance within
 20 28 schedule I also changes the criminal penalty for a violation
 20 29 involving the substance from a class "C" felony under Code
 20 30 section 124.401(1)(c)(8) to an aggravated misdemeanor under
 20 31 Code section 124.401(1)(d).  The bill also strikes a substance
 20 32 in Code section 124.204(6)(i)(3) from schedule I and does not
 20 33 reclassify the substance in any other substance schedule.
 20 34    The bill also removes numerous substances from schedule I
 20 35 which are currently classified as "stimulants" in Code section
 21  1 124.204(6)(i).
 21  2    The bill also strikes two narcotic substances from schedule

 17 33 commits an aggravated misdemeanor, or if the person delivers
 17 34 to a person under 18 years of age who is at least three years
 17 35 younger than the violator, the person commits a class "D"

 18 16 controlled substance may be combined for purposes of charging
 18 17 the offender.
 18 18    The amendment to Code section 124.401A provides that
 18 19 a person who is 18 years of age or older who unlawfully
 18 20 manufactures with the intent to distribute, distributes,
 18 21 or possesses with the intent to distribute an imitation
 18 22 controlled substance to another person 18 years of age or older
 18 23 within 1,000 feet of the real property comprising a public or
 18 24 nonpublic school, may be sentenced up to an additional term of
 18 25 confinement of five years in addition to any other penalty.
 18 26    The amendment to Code section 124.401B provides that
 18 27 a person who unlawfully possesses an imitation controlled
 18 28 substance within 1,000 feet of the real property comprising a
 18 29 school, public park, public pool, public recreation center, or
 18 30 marked school bus may be sentenced up to 100 hours of community
 18 31 service.
 18 32    The amendments to Code section 124.406 relate to the
 18 33 distribution or possession with the intent to distribute an
 18 34 imitation controlled substance to a person under 18 years of
 18 35 age.  A person who distributes or possesses with the intent to
 19  1 distribute an imitation controlled substance, represented to
 19  2 be a substance listed in schedule I or schedule II, to a person
 19  3 under 18 years of age commits a class "B" felony. The required
 19  4 penalty for such a violation is a minimum term of confinement
 19  5 of 10 years if the substance was distributed within 1,000
 19  6 feet of the real property comprising a public or nonpublic
 19  7 school, public park, public pool, or public recreation center.
 19  8 A person who distributes or possesses with the intent to
 19  9 distribute an imitation controlled substance, represented to be
 19 10 a substance listed in schedule III, to a person under 18 years
 19 11 of age, who is at least three years younger than the violator,

 19 21 controlled substance, and if the person is not referred to
 19 22 juvenile court, the peace officer shall make a reasonable
 19 23 effort to notify the person's custodial parent of the
 19 24 possession unless the officer has reasonable grounds to believe
 19 25 such notification is not in the best interests of the person.
 19 26 The bill specifies that if the person is taken into custody
 19 27 the juvenile court officer shall make a reasonable effort to
 19 28 identify the school of attendance and to notify the school or
 19 29 nonpublic school of the taking into custody of the person.
 19 30    The bill creates Code section 124.417, which is similar to
 19 31 Code section 124A.5 repealed by the bill.  A person registered
 19 32 under Code section 124.302 does not violate the bill if the
 19 33 person manufactures, delivers, possesses, or possesses with the
 19 34 intent to manufacture or deliver, or acts with others to do
 19 35 such activities, if the person uses the imitation controlled
 20  1 substance for use as a placebo by a registered practitioner in
 20  2 the court of professional practice or research.
 20  3    SCHEDULE I, III, AND IV CONTROLLED SUBSTANCES.  The bill
 20  4 transfers numerous substances classified as "hallucinogenic
 20  5 substances" under schedule I and reclassifies the substances
 20  6 as "other substances" under schedule I.  By transferring the
 20  7 substances to "other substances", a person commits a class "C"
 20  8 felony under Code section 124.401(1)(c)(8) if the violation
 20  9 involves such a substance. Under current law, a person commits
 20 10 an aggravated misdemeanor under Code section 124.401(1)(d) when
 20 11 committing such violations.
 20 12    The bill adds new substances as "hallucinogenic substances"
 20 13 under schedule I.  A person commits a class "C" felony under

 20 19 substances.
 20 20    The bill also adds new substances to the classification of
 20 21 "other substances" under schedule I.  A person commits a class
 20 22 "C" felony under Code section 124.401(1)(c)(8) for a violation
 20 23 involving the new substances.
 20 24    The bill strikes one substance classified as a
 20 25 "hallucinogenic substance" under schedule I and reclassifies
 20 26 the substance as a "stimulant" containing a synthetic cathinone
 20 27 under schedule I.  The transfer of the substance within
 20 28 schedule I also changes the criminal penalty for a violation
 20 29 involving the substance from a class "C" felony under Code
 20 30 section 124.401(1)(c)(8) to an aggravated misdemeanor under
 20 31 Code section 124.401(1)(d).  The bill also strikes a substance
 20 32 in Code section 124.204(6)(i)(3) from schedule I and does not
 20 33 reclassify the substance in any other substance schedule.
 20 34    The bill also removes numerous substances from schedule I
 20 35 which are currently classified as "stimulants" in Code section
 21  1 124.204(6)(i).
 21  2    The bill also strikes two narcotic substances from schedule
 21  3 III and adds three substances to schedule IV.  A violation
 21  4 involving a schedule IV controlled substance is punishable as
 21  5 an aggravated misdemeanor in Code section 124.401(1)(d).

 18  1 felony.  In addition, under current law, if a person unlawfully
 18  2 and knowingly publishes an advertisement or distributes in a
 18  3 public place a promotion for an imitation controlled substance
 18  4 the person commits a serious misdemeanor.
 18  5    The bill enhances the criminal penalties for controlled
 18  6 substances classified in Code sections 124.204(4)(ai) and
 18  7 124.204(6)(i) from an aggravated misdemeanor to a class "C"
 18  8 felony punishable pursuant to Code section 124.401(1)(c)(8).
 18  9 This change equalizes the criminal penalties with violations
 18 10 involving other schedule I controlled substances.
 18 11    The bill provides that if the same person commits two or
 18 12 more acts which are in violation of Code section 124.401(1)
 18 13 and the acts occur in the same location or time period so the
 18 14 acts are attributable to a single scheme, the acts may be

 18 16 controlled substance may be combined for purposes of charging
 18 17 the offender.

 19 31 Code section 124A.5 repealed by the bill.  A person registered
 19 32 under Code section 124.302 does not violate the bill if the
 19 33 person manufactures, delivers, possesses, or possesses with the
 19 34 intent to manufacture or deliver, or acts with others to do
 19 35 such activities, if the person uses the imitation controlled
 20  1 substance for use as a placebo by a registered practitioner in

 20  3    SCHEDULE I, III, AND IV CONTROLLED SUBSTANCES.  The bill
 20  4 transfers numerous substances classified as "hallucinogenic
 20  5 substances" under schedule I and reclassifies the substances
 20  6 as "other substances" under schedule I.  By transferring the
 20  7 substances to "other substances", a person commits a class "C"
 20  8 felony under Code section 124.401(1)(c)(8) if the violation
 20  9 involves such a substance. Under current law, a person commits
 20 10 an aggravated misdemeanor under Code section 124.401(1)(d) when
 20 11 committing such violations.
 20 12    The bill adds new substances as "hallucinogenic substances"

 20 19 substances.
 20 20    The bill also adds new substances to the classification of

 20 22 "C" felony under Code section 124.401(1)(c)(8) for a violation
 20 23 involving the new substances.
 20 24    The bill strikes one substance classified as a
 20 25 "hallucinogenic substance" under schedule I and reclassifies
 20 26 the substance as a "stimulant" containing a synthetic cathinone
 20 27 under schedule I.  The transfer of the substance within
 20 28 schedule I also changes the criminal penalty for a violation
 20 29 involving the substance from a class "C" felony under Code
 20 30 section 124.401(1)(c)(8) to an aggravated misdemeanor under
 20 31 Code section 124.401(1)(d).  The bill also strikes a substance

 20 33 reclassify the substance in any other substance schedule.
 20 34    The bill also removes numerous substances from schedule I
 20 35 which are currently classified as "stimulants" in Code section
 21  1 124.204(6)(i).
 21  2    The bill also strikes two narcotic substances from schedule

 18  9 This change equalizes the criminal penalties with violations
 18 10 involving other schedule I controlled substances.
 18 11    The bill provides that if the same person commits two or
 18 12 more acts which are in violation of Code section 124.401(1)
 18 13 and the acts occur in the same location or time period so the

 20 25 "hallucinogenic substance" under schedule I and reclassifies
