  2 10 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  2 11 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  2 12    Current law provides that a bicycle shall have a front
  2 13 lighted lamp and either a rear lighted lamp or a rear reflector
  2 14 at any time from sunset to sunrise, and at such other times
  2 15 when conditions such as fog, snow, sleet, or rain provide
  2 16 insufficient lighting to render clearly discernible persons and
  2 17 vehicles on the highway at a distance of 500 feet ahead.
  2 18    This bill provides that a bicycle or its rider shall have
  2 19 a front and rear lighted lamp during the stated periods of
  2 20 time, and may not have a rear reflector in lieu of the rear
  2 21 lighted lamp. The scheduled fine for violating this provision
  2 22 is $25. However, the bill provides that a citation issued for
  2 23 failure to have a front lamp or rear lamp on a bicycle or on a
  2 24 bicycle rider shall first provide for a 72=hour period within
  2 25 which the person charged with the violation shall replace or
  2 26 repair the lamp. If the person complies with the directive to
  2 27 replace or repair the bicycle or rider lamp, the citation shall
  2 28 be expunged.
