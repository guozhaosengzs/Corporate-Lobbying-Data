  6 28                           EXPLANATION
  6 29 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  6 30 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  6 31    This bill makes changes relating to notice and election
  6 32 requirements and limitations for the issuance of certain bonds
  6 33 by political subdivisions of the state.
  6 34    Current law specifies those bond issuances requiring
  6 35 voter approval and the dates of the elections at which these
  7  1 public measures may be submitted to the voters and requires
  7  2 that notice of the election be published between 4 and 20
  7  3 days prior to the election. The notice is required to show
  7  4 all public measures to be voted on at election. The bill
  7  5 requires counties, cities, townships, school districts, and
  7  6 merged areas, and any local board or commission authorized by
  7  7 law to issue bonds, to publish notice of the election on the
  7  8 proposition to issue the bonds at least 60 days before the day
  7  9 of the election. The bill applies to those bond issuances that
  7 10 under current law may be issued only upon voter approval. The
  7 11 additional notice is required to include the complete text of
  7 12 the public measure, the date of the meeting at which the bond
  7 13 election was called, and the date of the bond election.
  7 14    The bill also provides that a military or overseas voter
  7 15 may request and vote an armed forces absentee ballot for a
  7 16 local bond election. Under current law, armed forces absentee
  7 17 ballots must be printed 45 days before an associated election
  7 18 and must be mailed to military and overseas voters at specified
  7 19 times. Under current law, armed forces absentee ballots are
  7 20 only available for federal elections. Current law also allows
  7 21 certain family members of military and overseas voters to
  7 22 request armed forces absentee ballots on behalf of an eligible
  7 23 voter and requires that a county commissioner of elections
  7 24 (county auditor) send armed forces absentee ballots to an
  7 25 eligible voter for every federal election during a given
  7 26 calendar year, if a voter's request for such a ballot in that
  7 27 year does not specify a particular election. The bill extends
  7 28 these provisions to include bond elections.
  7 29    Current law provides that when a bond proposition is
  7 30 submitted to voters and fails to gain approval, the entity
  7 31 submitting the proposal is prohibited from resubmitting the
  7 32 proposal to voters, in any form, for a period of six months.
  7 33 Under the bill, if an entity submits a proposal which fails to
  7 34 gain approval of the voters, the entity is then prohibited from
  7 35 resubmitting the proposal to voters for a period of one year.
  8  1 If a failed proposal is later resubmitted and again fails to
  8  2 gain approval, the entity is then prohibited from resubmitting
  8  3 the proposal for two years.
  8  4    The bill may include a state mandate as defined in Code
  8  5 section 25B.3.  The bill makes inapplicable Code section 25B.2,
  8  6 subsection 3, which would relieve a political subdivision from
  8  7 complying with a state mandate if funding for the cost of
  8  8 the state mandate is not provided or specified. Therefore,
  8  9 political subdivisions are required to comply with any state
  8 10 mandate included in the bill.

  7  7 law to issue bonds, to publish notice of the election on the

  6 29 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  6 30 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  6 31    This bill makes changes relating to notice and election
  6 32 requirements and limitations for the issuance of certain bonds
  6 33 by political subdivisions of the state.
  6 34    Current law specifies those bond issuances requiring
  6 35 voter approval and the dates of the elections at which these
  7  1 public measures may be submitted to the voters and requires
  7  2 that notice of the election be published between 4 and 20
  7  3 days prior to the election. The notice is required to show
  7  4 all public measures to be voted on at election. The bill
  7  5 requires counties, cities, townships, school districts, and
  7  6 merged areas, and any local board or commission authorized by
  7  7 law to issue bonds, to publish notice of the election on the
  7  8 proposition to issue the bonds at least 60 days before the day
  7  9 of the election. The bill applies to those bond issuances that
  7 10 under current law may be issued only upon voter approval. The
  7 11 additional notice is required to include the complete text of
  7 12 the public measure, the date of the meeting at which the bond
  7 13 election was called, and the date of the bond election.
  7 14    The bill also provides that a military or overseas voter
  7 15 may request and vote an armed forces absentee ballot for a
  7 16 local bond election. Under current law, armed forces absentee
  7 17 ballots must be printed 45 days before an associated election
  7 18 and must be mailed to military and overseas voters at specified
  7 19 times. Under current law, armed forces absentee ballots are
  7 20 only available for federal elections. Current law also allows
  7 21 certain family members of military and overseas voters to
  7 22 request armed forces absentee ballots on behalf of an eligible
  7 23 voter and requires that a county commissioner of elections
  7 24 (county auditor) send armed forces absentee ballots to an
  7 25 eligible voter for every federal election during a given
  7 26 calendar year, if a voter's request for such a ballot in that
  7 27 year does not specify a particular election. The bill extends
  7 28 these provisions to include bond elections.
  7 29    Current law provides that when a bond proposition is
  7 30 submitted to voters and fails to gain approval, the entity
  7 31 submitting the proposal is prohibited from resubmitting the
  7 32 proposal to voters, in any form, for a period of six months.
  7 33 Under the bill, if an entity submits a proposal which fails to
  7 34 gain approval of the voters, the entity is then prohibited from
  7 35 resubmitting the proposal to voters for a period of one year.
  8  1 If a failed proposal is later resubmitted and again fails to

  8  3 the proposal for two years.
  8  4    The bill may include a state mandate as defined in Code
  8  5 section 25B.3.  The bill makes inapplicable Code section 25B.2,
  8  6 subsection 3, which would relieve a political subdivision from
