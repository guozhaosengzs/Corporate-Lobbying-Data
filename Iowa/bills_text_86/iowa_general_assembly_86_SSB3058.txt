or

16


incurred
on
or
after
the
effective
date
of

date

Act.

For
purposes
of

section,

is
made
and
an
20


obligation
is
incurred
at
the
time
provided
in
section

EXPLANATION
22


The
inclusion
of
this
explanation
does
not
constitute
agreement
with
23


the
explanation’s
substance
by
the
members
of
the
general
assembly.
24


GENERAL.
This
bill
amends
Code
chapter
684
referred
to
25


as
the
“Uniform
Fraudulent
Transfer
Act”
as
approved
by
the
26


national
conference
of
commissioners
on
uniform
state
laws.


27


The
law
concerns
an
avoidance
action
brought
by
a
creditor
28


(plaintiff)
to
set
aside
(void)
a
transfer
made
or
obligation
29


incurred
by
an
insolvent
debtor
to
a
third-party
transferee
30


(defendant)
including
as
part
of
a
bankruptcy
proceeding.
31


Consequently,
the
creditor
seeks
that
the
value
of
the
property
32


be
returned
to
the
debtor
or
the
debtor’s
bankruptcy
estate.
33


MODEL
ACT.
The
bill
is
based
on
revisions
to
that
Act


34


approved
by
the
commissioners
in
2014.

replaces

term
“fraudulent

with
the
broader
term
“voidable

transaction”
and
changes
the
name
of
the
Code
chapter
to
the
2


“Iowa
Uniform
Voidable
Transactions
Act”
(Code
section
684.12).
3


EXTINGUISHING
OF
CLAIM.
The
bill
changes
a
current
Iowa
4


law
that
extinguishes
a
claim
after
five
years
(Code
section
5


684.9).
The
bill
adopts
the
model
Act’s
four-year
limitation.
6


RECORDS.
The
bill
replaces
the
term
“writing”
with
“record”
7


and
provides
that
a
“record”
may
be
in
an
electronic
format
8


(Code
section
684.1).
Currently,
an
obligation
is
incurred
9


when
it
is
made
orally
or
if
evidenced
by
a
writing
(Code
10


section
684.6).
11


INSOLVENCY.
Generally,
a
debtor
is
insolvent
if
the
sum
12


of
the
debtor’s
debts
is
more
than
the
sum
of
debtor’s
assets
13


(Code
section
684.2).
The
bill
provides
that
such
debts
do
14


not
include
those
subject
to
a
bona
fide
dispute.
It
also
15


eliminates
special
treatment
accorded
to
partnerships
by
16


providing
that
the
aggregate
net
worth
of
the
general
partners
17


is
no
longer
to
be
added
to
the
partnership’s
assets.
18


UNIFORM
COMMERCIAL
CODE
——
ARTICLE
9
TRANSACTIONS.
The
bill
19


provides
that
a
transfer
may
be
voidable
even
if
the
transferee
20


is
also
a
secured
creditor
under
Article
9
of
the
Uniform
21


Commercial
Code
(Code
chapter
554).
The
secured
creditor
must
22


receive
collateral
for
partial
or
full
satisfaction
of
the
23


obligation
and
the
transfer
must
occur
without
public
sale
or
24


judicial
foreclosure
(Code
section
684.8).
25


ORGANIZATIONS
AND
SERIES.
The
bill
adds
the
term
26


“organization”
which
is
defined
to
mean
a
“person”
other
than
27


an
individual
(Code
section
684.1).
It
also
provides
that
an
28


organization
and
separate
legal
components
of
that
organization
29


referred
to
as
a
“series”
may
each
be
treated
as
a
separate
30


person
unconnected
to
an
avoidance
action
(new
Code
section
31


684.9B).
In
order
to
be
considered
a
separate
person,
the
32


organization
or
series
must
be
created
in
the
same
organic
33


record
(e.g.,
articles
of
incorporation),
and
the
debt
must
be
34


enforceable

PROCEDURAL
RULES.
The
bill
provides
that
a
rebuttable
2


presumption
exists
that
a
debtor
is
insolvent
if
the
debtor
3


fails
to
pay
debts
as
they
become
due.
It
also
provides
that
4


a
creditor
has
the
burden
of
proving

elements
of
a
claim
5


(Code
section
684.5)
and
a

has
the
burden
of
proving

the
elements
of
a

(Code
section

The
