 19 27 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
 19 28 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
 19 29    This bill relates to civil protective orders in sexual abuse
 19 30 cases, and makes penalties applicable.
 19 31    Under current law, a defendant accused of sexual abuse must
 19 32 be arrested for sexual abuse before a victim can apply for a
 19 33 criminal no=contact order against the defendant (Code section
 19 34 664A.3) or the victim can apply for a criminal no=contact order
 19 35 against a defendant upon the defendant's release from jail or
 20  1 prison (Code section 709.19).
 20  2    The bill creates new Code chapter 236A, the sexual abuse Act,
 20  3 allowing a victim of sexual abuse to seek relief from sexual
 20  4 abuse by filing a petition in district court for a sexual abuse
 20  5 civil protective order (emergency, temporary, and permanent)
 20  6 prior to the arrest of the defendant in such a situation
 20  7 affording the victim and the victim's family members, whose
 20  8 welfare may be affected by the sexual abuse situation, the
 20  9 same civil protections as victims of domestic abuse under Code
 20 10 chapter 236.  The bill defines sexual abuse as the commission
 20 11 of a crime defined in Code chapter 709 (sexual abuse) and
 20 12 Code sections 726.2 (incest) and 728.12 (sexual exploitation
 20 13 of a minor), and to include sexual abuse crimes in other
 20 14 jurisdictions under statutes that are substantially similar to
 20 15 the aforementioned statutes.
 20 16    Under the bill, upon a finding by the court, by a
 20 17 preponderance of the evidence, that a defendant has engaged
 20 18 in sexual abuse against the plaintiff, the court may order
 20 19 the defendant to cease the abuse, and order the defendant to
 20 20 stay away from the plaintiff's residence, school, or place
 20 21 of employment. In seeking a protective order, a victim has
 20 22 the right to seek help from the court with or without the
 20 23 assistance of an attorney and without the payment of court
 20 24 costs.
 20 25    The bill requires criminal or juvenile justice agencies to
 20 26 collect and maintain information on incidents involving sexual
 20 27 abuse and to provide the information to the department of
 20 28 public safety.
 20 29    The bill makes conforming changes to Code provisions
 20 30 relating to the issuance of and violations of civil protective
 20 31 orders, the duties of the departments of justice and public
 20 32 health, delinquency detention, insurance practices, court
 20 33 operating costs, and peace officer arrests.
