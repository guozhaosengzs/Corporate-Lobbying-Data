 40 23 not compete with private enterprise. Under current law, the
 40 24 DOT may compete with private enterprise in aircraft pool
 40 25 operations. The bill eliminates that exception.

 40 27 of registration for aircraft are required to display the

 42 29 The bill also expands Code sections that refer to commercial
 42 30 driver's licenses to also refer to commercial learner's
 42 31 permits.
 42 32    The bill requires the DOT to adopt rules to administer
 42 33 commercial learner's permits in compliance with the procedures
 42 34 set forth by federal law. The bill allows the DOT to adopt
 42 35 such rules on an emergency basis, with such provision taking
 43  1 effect upon enactment. The bill provides for qualifications
 43  2 and requirements for holders of a commercial learner's permit,

 43 21 of a driving skills test if the applicant has separated
 43 22 from military service in the past 90 days, except where the
 43 23 applicant has violated a state or local traffic law. The bill
 43 24 extends the military separation limit to one year, and expands
 43 25 the exception to include violations of military traffic laws.
 43 26    The bill provides that the fee for removing full air brake,
 43 27 manual transmission, tractor=trailer, or passenger vehicle
 43 28 restrictions on a commercial driver's license or commercial
 43 29 learner's permit is $10. The bill also requires the DOT to

 42 29 The bill also expands Code sections that refer to commercial
 42 30 driver's licenses to also refer to commercial learner's
 42 31 permits.

 40 17                           EXPLANATION
 40 18 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
 40 19 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
 40 20    This bill relates to matters under the purview of the
 40 21 department of transportation (DOT).
 40 22    DIVISION I == AVIATION.  Generally, state agencies may
 40 23 not compete with private enterprise. Under current law, the
 40 24 DOT may compete with private enterprise in aircraft pool
 40 25 operations. The bill eliminates that exception.
 40 26    Under current law, certain persons with a certificate
 40 27 of registration for aircraft are required to display the
 40 28 registration and present the registration to the DOT upon
 40 29 request. The bill eliminates these requirements.
 40 30    DIVISION II == TRANSPORTATION DEPARTMENT AND COMMISSION.
 40 31    DEPARTMENT OF TRANSPORTATION.  Code chapter 307, which
 40 32 establishes the DOT, is amended and reorganized to reflect
 40 33 the current structure and responsibilities of the department
 40 34 and its divisions. Provisions which relate to the state

 41  1 307 and moved to Code chapter 307A, which relates to the
 41  2 commission.
 41  3    The bill also repeals a Code section establishing the DOT's
 41  4 responsibility to train construction inspectors to perform

 41  9 commission, is amended to include provisions establishing the
 41 10 commission and providing for its organization and membership.
 41 11 Provisions which relate to the duties performed by the DOT are
 41 12 repealed from Code chapter 307A and moved to Code chapter 307.
 41 13    DIVISION III == MOTOR VEHICLES.  Current law provides that
 41 14 travel trailers, including fifth=wheel travel trailers, shall
 41 15 not exceed 40 feet. The bill increases this limitation to 45
 41 16 feet.
 41 17    The bill expands the provision governing the issuance of
 41 18 regular registration plates rather than "official" registration
 41 19 plates to certain persons exempt from registration fees to
 41 20 include federal law enforcement officers.
 41 21    The bill increases the fee for issuance of a replacement
 41 22 driver's license which does not identify a person as "under 18"
 41 23 or "under 21" upon attaining such age from $1 to $10.
 41 24    The bill provides that a person whose driver's license was
 41 25 suspended or revoked for certain motor vehicle violations and
 41 26 was also suspended or revoked for operating=while=intoxicated
 41 27 is eligible for a temporary restricted license if the person
 41 28 meets the eligibility requirements of both provisions.
 41 29    The bill provides that annual permits for vehicles of
 41 30 excessive size may be issued for vehicles with divisible loads
 41 31 of bagged livestock bedding. The bill also provides that motor

 41 33 sales of motor vehicles at the Iowa state fair, if the state
 41 34 fair is in the dealer's community.
 41 35    The bill amends provisions relating to vehicle registrations
 42  1 pursuant to registration reciprocity apportionment agreements.
 42  2 The bill alters the late filing penalty for registration fees
 42  3 imposed by the department from five percent of fees due to
 42  4 all states to five percent of the fees due to the state of
 42  5 Iowa. The bill also provides that late penalties calculated
 42  6 by the department will remain due to the state until the fees
 42  7 and penalties are received.  The effective date of these fee
 42  8 provisions is January 1, 2016.
 42  9    DIVISION IV == RAIL TRANSPORTATION.  The bill repeals
 42 10 Code sections requiring headlights and windshields on track
 42 11 power cars and the accompanying penalties, governing caboose
 42 12 standards, requiring establishment and maintenance of freight
 42 13 offices that are accessible to the public, requiring horns

 42 25 redefines commercial driver's license and defines commercial
 42 26 learner's permit as the terms are defined in the United
 42 27 States code of federal regulations. The bill alters weight
 42 28 calculations for commercial motor vehicles and tank vehicles.
 42 29 The bill also expands Code sections that refer to commercial
 42 30 driver's licenses to also refer to commercial learner's
 42 31 permits.
 42 32    The bill requires the DOT to adopt rules to administer
 42 33 commercial learner's permits in compliance with the procedures
 42 34 set forth by federal law. The bill allows the DOT to adopt
 42 35 such rules on an emergency basis, with such provision taking
 43  1 effect upon enactment. The bill provides for qualifications
 43  2 and requirements for holders of a commercial learner's permit,
 43  3 including operation of the vehicle accompanied by a holder
 43  4 of a commercial driver's license in certain circumstances.
 43  5 The bill also provides that commercial learner's permits
 43  6 are preconditions to the initial issuance or upgrade of a
 43  7 commercial driver's license, permit holders are not eligible to
 43  8 take driver's tests required for a commercial driver's license
 43  9 for 14 days after issuance of the permit, and commercial

 43 11 transporting hazardous material.

 43 13 commercial driver's licenses in compliance with the procedures
 43 14 set forth by federal law. The bill allows the DOT to adopt
 43 15 such rules on an emergency basis, with such provision taking
 43 16 effect upon enactment. The bill also allows the DOT to
 43 17 administer rules requiring additional information, proofs, or
 43 18 certifications in order to qualify for a commercial driver's
 43 19 license.
 43 20    Current law provides that the DOT may waive the requirement
 43 21 of a driving skills test if the applicant has separated
 43 22 from military service in the past 90 days, except where the
 43 23 applicant has violated a state or local traffic law. The bill
 43 24 extends the military separation limit to one year, and expands
 43 25 the exception to include violations of military traffic laws.
 43 26    The bill provides that the fee for removing full air brake,
 43 27 manual transmission, tractor=trailer, or passenger vehicle
 43 28 restrictions on a commercial driver's license or commercial
 43 29 learner's permit is $10. The bill also requires the DOT to
 43 30 disqualify the commercial driver's license or commercial
 43 31 learner's permit of a person suspected or convicted of fraud
 43 32 related to the testing for or issuance of the license or
 43 33 permit, and to adopt rules governing such disqualification.
