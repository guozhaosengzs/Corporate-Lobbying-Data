  6 16                           EXPLANATION
  6 17 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  6 18 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  6 19    This bill relates to voter registration by allowing
  6 20 registration of eligible electors to vote following review
  6 21 of electronic records received from driver's license and
  6 22 nonoperator's identification card applications by county
  6 23 commissioners of registration (county auditors).
  6 24    The bill requires that the office of driver services of the
  6 25 department of transportation transmit to the state registrar of
  6 26 voters (the secretary of state) electronic records containing
  6 27 the legal name, age, residence, and citizenship information
  6 28 for, and the electronic signature of, each person submitting
  6 29 an application for a driver's license or nonoperator's
  6 30 identification card, or any renewal application. Current Code
  6 31 section 321.182 requires that an application for a license
  6 32 or card include an applicant's full name, signature, current
  6 33 mailing address, current residential address, date of birth,
  6 34 social security number, and other information. Under current
  6 35 administrative rules of the state department of transportation,
  7  1 an applicant for a license or card is required to provide proof
  7  2 of lawful status in the United States. Also under current
  7  3 administrative rules, a person's signature for a driver's
  7  4 license or nonoperator's identification card application is
  7  5 required to be captured electronically. Under current law,
  7  6 a county treasurer's office participating in county issuance
  7  7 of driver's licenses is required to participate in voter
  7  8 registration to the same extent as a license facility of the
  7  9 state department of transportation.
  7 10    The bill requires the state registrar of voters to transmit
  7 11 the electronic records and electronic signatures to the county
  7 12 commissioner of registration of the county where the person
  7 13 resides. The bill requires that the county commissioner review
  7 14 the electronic record and any other relevant information to
  7 15 determine if a person is an eligible elector. If the county
  7 16 commissioner determines a person to be an eligible elector
  7 17 and the person is not registered to vote in the county, the
  7 18 county commissioner is required to notify the person of the
  7 19 separate processes to decline to register to vote or to declare
  7 20 a political party affiliation. If a notified person fails to
  7 21 decline voter registration within 21 days after the county
  7 22 commissioner issued the notification, the bill provides that
  7 23 the electronic record and electronic signature shall constitute
  7 24 a completed voter registration form for that person and the
  7 25 bill requires the county commissioner to register the person to
  7 26 vote in that county and send the person an acknowledgment as
  7 27 required by current law.
  7 28    The bill prohibits a county commissioner from adding a
  7 29 person's name to a voter registration list until at least 21
  7 30 days after the commissioner has issued notification to the
  7 31 person. The bill requires that a county commissioner send an
  7 32 acknowledgment of registration within seven business days of
  7 33 registering a person under the bill. The bill also provides
  7 34 that the electronic record and electronic signature of a person
  7 35 who does not qualify as an eligible elector does not constitute
  8  1 a completed voter registration form. Under the bill, such a
  8  2 person submitting an application for a license or card will
  8  3 not be subject to charges for voter registration fraud under
  8  4 section 39A.2 for submitting such an application.
  8  5    The bill also grants the state voter registration commission
  8  6 the authority to adopt rules to administer and interpret the
  8  7 provisions of the bill relating to voter registration at motor
  8  8 vehicle driver's license stations.  If interpretive rulemaking
  8  9 authority is clearly vested in the discretion of an agency by
  8 10 statute, the applicable judicial standard of review is whether
  8 11 the rules constitute an irrational, illogical, or wholly
  8 12 unjustifiable interpretation of law by the agency (Code section
  8 13 17A.19(10)(l)). If interpretive rulemaking authority is not
  8 14 clearly vested in the discretion of an agency, the applicable
  8 15 judicial standard of review is whether the rules constitute an
  8 16 erroneous interpretation of law (Code section 17A.19(10)(c)).
  8 17    The bill makes changes to current law related to address
  8 18 confidentiality program participants under Code chapter
  8 19 9E by requiring the state registrar to adopt rules for
  8 20 administration of registration for those participants. The
  8 21 bill maintains current law to allow for submission of a paper
  8 22 voter registration form through driver's license offices. The
  8 23 bill specifies that a requirement that separate registration
  8 24 forms be signed by each individual registrant only applies to
  8 25 paper registration forms. Under the bill, driver's license
  8 26 offices are required to transmit voter registration forms
  8 27 to the appropriate county commissioner and to transmit all
  8 28 electronic records and electronic signatures to the state
  8 29 registrar of voters.
  8 30    The bill provides that the state voter registration
  8 31 commission and the department of transportation may adopt
  8 32 emergency rules to implement the provisions of the bill. Under
  8 33 current law, the state registrar of voters is required to
  8 34 establish rules regulating transmission of voter registration
  8 35 forms from driver's license stations. Under the bill, such
  9  1 rules are required to be established by the state commission.
  9  2    The bill may include a state mandate as defined in Code
  9  3 section 25B.3.  The bill makes inapplicable Code section 25B.2,
  9  4 subsection 3, which would relieve a political subdivision from
  9  5 complying with a state mandate if funding for the cost of
  9  6 the state mandate is not provided or specified.  Therefore,
  9  7 political subdivisions are required to comply with any state
  9  8 mandate included in the bill.
  9  9    The bill takes effect upon enactment.

  6 20 registration of eligible electors to vote following review
  6 21 of electronic records received from driver's license and
  6 22 nonoperator's identification card applications by county
  6 23 commissioners of registration (county auditors).
  6 24    The bill requires that the office of driver services of the
  6 25 department of transportation transmit to the state registrar of
  6 26 voters (the secretary of state) electronic records containing
  6 27 the legal name, age, residence, and citizenship information
  6 28 for, and the electronic signature of, each person submitting
  6 29 an application for a driver's license or nonoperator's
  6 30 identification card, or any renewal application. Current Code
  6 31 section 321.182 requires that an application for a license
  6 32 or card include an applicant's full name, signature, current
  6 33 mailing address, current residential address, date of birth,
  6 34 social security number, and other information. Under current
  6 35 administrative rules of the state department of transportation,
  7  1 an applicant for a license or card is required to provide proof
  7  2 of lawful status in the United States. Also under current
  7  3 administrative rules, a person's signature for a driver's
  7  4 license or nonoperator's identification card application is
  7  5 required to be captured electronically. Under current law,
  7  6 a county treasurer's office participating in county issuance
  7  7 of driver's licenses is required to participate in voter
  7  8 registration to the same extent as a license facility of the
  7  9 state department of transportation.
  7 10    The bill requires the state registrar of voters to transmit
  7 11 the electronic records and electronic signatures to the county
  7 12 commissioner of registration of the county where the person
  7 13 resides. The bill requires that the county commissioner review
  7 14 the electronic record and any other relevant information to
  7 15 determine if a person is an eligible elector. If the county
  7 16 commissioner determines a person to be an eligible elector
  7 17 and the person is not registered to vote in the county, the
  7 18 county commissioner is required to notify the person of the
  7 19 separate processes to decline to register to vote or to declare
  7 20 a political party affiliation. If a notified person fails to
  7 21 decline voter registration within 21 days after the county
  7 22 commissioner issued the notification, the bill provides that
  7 23 the electronic record and electronic signature shall constitute
  7 24 a completed voter registration form for that person and the
  7 25 bill requires the county commissioner to register the person to
  7 26 vote in that county and send the person an acknowledgment as
  7 27 required by current law.
  7 28    The bill prohibits a county commissioner from adding a
  7 29 person's name to a voter registration list until at least 21
  7 30 days after the commissioner has issued notification to the
  7 31 person. The bill requires that a county commissioner send an
  7 32 acknowledgment of registration within seven business days of
  7 33 registering a person under the bill. The bill also provides
  7 34 that the electronic record and electronic signature of a person
  7 35 who does not qualify as an eligible elector does not constitute
  8  1 a completed voter registration form. Under the bill, such a
  8  2 person submitting an application for a license or card will
  8  3 not be subject to charges for voter registration fraud under
  8  4 section 39A.2 for submitting such an application.
  8  5    The bill also grants the state voter registration commission
  8  6 the authority to adopt rules to administer and interpret the
  8  7 provisions of the bill relating to voter registration at motor
  8  8 vehicle driver's license stations.  If interpretive rulemaking
  8  9 authority is clearly vested in the discretion of an agency by
  8 10 statute, the applicable judicial standard of review is whether
  8 11 the rules constitute an irrational, illogical, or wholly
  8 12 unjustifiable interpretation of law by the agency (Code section
  8 13 17A.19(10)(l)). If interpretive rulemaking authority is not
  8 14 clearly vested in the discretion of an agency, the applicable
  8 15 judicial standard of review is whether the rules constitute an
  8 16 erroneous interpretation of law (Code section 17A.19(10)(c)).
  8 17    The bill makes changes to current law related to address
  8 18 confidentiality program participants under Code chapter
  8 19 9E by requiring the state registrar to adopt rules for
  8 20 administration of registration for those participants. The
  8 21 bill maintains current law to allow for submission of a paper
  8 22 voter registration form through driver's license offices. The
  8 23 bill specifies that a requirement that separate registration
  8 24 forms be signed by each individual registrant only applies to
  8 25 paper registration forms. Under the bill, driver's license
  8 26 offices are required to transmit voter registration forms
  8 27 to the appropriate county commissioner and to transmit all
  8 28 electronic records and electronic signatures to the state
  8 29 registrar of voters.
  8 30    The bill provides that the state voter registration
  8 31 commission and the department of transportation may adopt
  8 32 emergency rules to implement the provisions of the bill. Under
  8 33 current law, the state registrar of voters is required to
  8 34 establish rules regulating transmission of voter registration
  8 35 forms from driver's license stations. Under the bill, such
  9  1 rules are required to be established by the state commission.
  9  2    The bill may include a state mandate as defined in Code
  9  3 section 25B.3.  The bill makes inapplicable Code section 25B.2,
  9  4 subsection 3, which would relieve a political subdivision from
  9  5 complying with a state mandate if funding for the cost of
  9  6 the state mandate is not provided or specified.  Therefore,
  9  7 political subdivisions are required to comply with any state
  9  8 mandate included in the bill.

  7 28    The bill prohibits a county commissioner from adding a

  6 16                           EXPLANATION
  6 17 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  6 18 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  6 19    This bill relates to voter registration by allowing
  6 20 registration of eligible electors to vote following review
  6 21 of electronic records received from driver's license and
  6 22 nonoperator's identification card applications by county
  6 23 commissioners of registration (county auditors).
  6 24    The bill requires that the office of driver services of the
  6 25 department of transportation transmit to the state registrar of
  6 26 voters (the secretary of state) electronic records containing
  6 27 the legal name, age, residence, and citizenship information
  6 28 for, and the electronic signature of, each person submitting
  6 29 an application for a driver's license or nonoperator's
  6 30 identification card, or any renewal application. Current Code
  6 31 section 321.182 requires that an application for a license
  6 32 or card include an applicant's full name, signature, current
  6 33 mailing address, current residential address, date of birth,
  6 34 social security number, and other information. Under current
  6 35 administrative rules of the state department of transportation,
  7  1 an applicant for a license or card is required to provide proof
  7  2 of lawful status in the United States. Also under current
  7  3 administrative rules, a person's signature for a driver's
  7  4 license or nonoperator's identification card application is
  7  5 required to be captured electronically. Under current law,
  7  6 a county treasurer's office participating in county issuance
  7  7 of driver's licenses is required to participate in voter
  7  8 registration to the same extent as a license facility of the
  7  9 state department of transportation.
  7 10    The bill requires the state registrar of voters to transmit
  7 11 the electronic records and electronic signatures to the county
  7 12 commissioner of registration of the county where the person
  7 13 resides. The bill requires that the county commissioner review
  7 14 the electronic record and any other relevant information to
  7 15 determine if a person is an eligible elector. If the county
  7 16 commissioner determines a person to be an eligible elector
  7 17 and the person is not registered to vote in the county, the
  7 18 county commissioner is required to notify the person of the
  7 19 separate processes to decline to register to vote or to declare
  7 20 a political party affiliation. If a notified person fails to
  7 21 decline voter registration within 21 days after the county
  7 22 commissioner issued the notification, the bill provides that
  7 23 the electronic record and electronic signature shall constitute
  7 24 a completed voter registration form for that person and the
  7 25 bill requires the county commissioner to register the person to
  7 26 vote in that county and send the person an acknowledgment as
  7 27 required by current law.
  7 28    The bill prohibits a county commissioner from adding a
  7 29 person's name to a voter registration list until at least 21
  7 30 days after the commissioner has issued notification to the
  7 31 person. The bill requires that a county commissioner send an
  7 32 acknowledgment of registration within seven business days of
  7 33 registering a person under the bill. The bill also provides
  7 34 that the electronic record and electronic signature of a person
  7 35 who does not qualify as an eligible elector does not constitute
  8  1 a completed voter registration form. Under the bill, such a
  8  2 person submitting an application for a license or card will
  8  3 not be subject to charges for voter registration fraud under
  8  4 section 39A.2 for submitting such an application.
  8  5    The bill also grants the state voter registration commission
  8  6 the authority to adopt rules to administer and interpret the
  8  7 provisions of the bill relating to voter registration at motor
  8  8 vehicle driver's license stations.  If interpretive rulemaking
  8  9 authority is clearly vested in the discretion of an agency by
  8 10 statute, the applicable judicial standard of review is whether
  8 11 the rules constitute an irrational, illogical, or wholly
  8 12 unjustifiable interpretation of law by the agency (Code section
  8 13 17A.19(10)(l)). If interpretive rulemaking authority is not
  8 14 clearly vested in the discretion of an agency, the applicable
  8 15 judicial standard of review is whether the rules constitute an
  8 16 erroneous interpretation of law (Code section 17A.19(10)(c)).
  8 17    The bill makes changes to current law related to address
  8 18 confidentiality program participants under Code chapter
  8 19 9E by requiring the state registrar to adopt rules for
  8 20 administration of registration for those participants. The
  8 21 bill maintains current law to allow for submission of a paper
  8 22 voter registration form through driver's license offices. The
  8 23 bill specifies that a requirement that separate registration
  8 24 forms be signed by each individual registrant only applies to
  8 25 paper registration forms. Under the bill, driver's license
  8 26 offices are required to transmit voter registration forms
  8 27 to the appropriate county commissioner and to transmit all
  8 28 electronic records and electronic signatures to the state
  8 29 registrar of voters.
  8 30    The bill provides that the state voter registration
  8 31 commission and the department of transportation may adopt
  8 32 emergency rules to implement the provisions of the bill. Under
  8 33 current law, the state registrar of voters is required to
  8 34 establish rules regulating transmission of voter registration
  8 35 forms from driver's license stations. Under the bill, such
  9  1 rules are required to be established by the state commission.
  9  2    The bill may include a state mandate as defined in Code
  9  3 section 25B.3.  The bill makes inapplicable Code section 25B.2,
  9  4 subsection 3, which would relieve a political subdivision from
  9  5 complying with a state mandate if funding for the cost of
  9  6 the state mandate is not provided or specified.  Therefore,
  9  7 political subdivisions are required to comply with any state
  9  8 mandate included in the bill.

  6 15 of immediate importance, takes effect upon enactment.
  6 16                           EXPLANATION
  6 17 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  6 18 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  6 19    This bill relates to voter registration by allowing
  6 20 registration of eligible electors to vote following review
  6 21 of electronic records received from driver's license and
  6 22 nonoperator's identification card applications by county
  6 23 commissioners of registration (county auditors).
  6 24    The bill requires that the office of driver services of the
  6 25 department of transportation transmit to the state registrar of
  6 26 voters (the secretary of state) electronic records containing
  6 27 the legal name, age, residence, and citizenship information
  6 28 for, and the electronic signature of, each person submitting
  6 29 an application for a driver's license or nonoperator's
  6 30 identification card, or any renewal application. Current Code
  6 31 section 321.182 requires that an application for a license
  6 32 or card include an applicant's full name, signature, current
  6 33 mailing address, current residential address, date of birth,
  6 34 social security number, and other information. Under current
  6 35 administrative rules of the state department of transportation,
  7  1 an applicant for a license or card is required to provide proof
  7  2 of lawful status in the United States. Also under current
  7  3 administrative rules, a person's signature for a driver's
  7  4 license or nonoperator's identification card application is
  7  5 required to be captured electronically. Under current law,
  7  6 a county treasurer's office participating in county issuance
  7  7 of driver's licenses is required to participate in voter
  7  8 registration to the same extent as a license facility of the
  7  9 state department of transportation.
  7 10    The bill requires the state registrar of voters to transmit
  7 11 the electronic records and electronic signatures to the county
  7 12 commissioner of registration of the county where the person
  7 13 resides. The bill requires that the county commissioner review
  7 14 the electronic record and any other relevant information to
  7 15 determine if a person is an eligible elector. If the county
  7 16 commissioner determines a person to be an eligible elector
  7 17 and the person is not registered to vote in the county, the
  7 18 county commissioner is required to notify the person of the
  7 19 separate processes to decline to register to vote or to declare
  7 20 a political party affiliation. If a notified person fails to
  7 21 decline voter registration within 21 days after the county
  7 22 commissioner issued the notification, the bill provides that
  7 23 the electronic record and electronic signature shall constitute
  7 24 a completed voter registration form for that person and the
  7 25 bill requires the county commissioner to register the person to
  7 26 vote in that county and send the person an acknowledgment as
  7 27 required by current law.
  7 28    The bill prohibits a county commissioner from adding a
  7 29 person's name to a voter registration list until at least 21
  7 30 days after the commissioner has issued notification to the
  7 31 person. The bill requires that a county commissioner send an
  7 32 acknowledgment of registration within seven business days of
  7 33 registering a person under the bill. The bill also provides
  7 34 that the electronic record and electronic signature of a person
  7 35 who does not qualify as an eligible elector does not constitute
  8  1 a completed voter registration form. Under the bill, such a
  8  2 person submitting an application for a license or card will
  8  3 not be subject to charges for voter registration fraud under
  8  4 section 39A.2 for submitting such an application.
  8  5    The bill also grants the state voter registration commission
  8  6 the authority to adopt rules to administer and interpret the
  8  7 provisions of the bill relating to voter registration at motor
  8  8 vehicle driver's license stations.  If interpretive rulemaking
  8  9 authority is clearly vested in the discretion of an agency by
  8 10 statute, the applicable judicial standard of review is whether
  8 11 the rules constitute an irrational, illogical, or wholly
  8 12 unjustifiable interpretation of law by the agency (Code section
  8 13 17A.19(10)(l)). If interpretive rulemaking authority is not
  8 14 clearly vested in the discretion of an agency, the applicable
  8 15 judicial standard of review is whether the rules constitute an
  8 16 erroneous interpretation of law (Code section 17A.19(10)(c)).
  8 17    The bill makes changes to current law related to address
  8 18 confidentiality program participants under Code chapter
  8 19 9E by requiring the state registrar to adopt rules for
  8 20 administration of registration for those participants. The
  8 21 bill maintains current law to allow for submission of a paper
  8 22 voter registration form through driver's license offices. The
  8 23 bill specifies that a requirement that separate registration
  8 24 forms be signed by each individual registrant only applies to
  8 25 paper registration forms. Under the bill, driver's license
  8 26 offices are required to transmit voter registration forms
  8 27 to the appropriate county commissioner and to transmit all
  8 28 electronic records and electronic signatures to the state
  8 29 registrar of voters.
  8 30    The bill provides that the state voter registration
  8 31 commission and the department of transportation may adopt
  8 32 emergency rules to implement the provisions of the bill. Under
  8 33 current law, the state registrar of voters is required to
  8 34 establish rules regulating transmission of voter registration
  8 35 forms from driver's license stations. Under the bill, such
  9  1 rules are required to be established by the state commission.
  9  2    The bill may include a state mandate as defined in Code
  9  3 section 25B.3.  The bill makes inapplicable Code section 25B.2,
  9  4 subsection 3, which would relieve a political subdivision from
  9  5 complying with a state mandate if funding for the cost of
  9  6 the state mandate is not provided or specified.  Therefore,
  9  7 political subdivisions are required to comply with any state
  9  8 mandate included in the bill.

  6 33 mailing address, current residential address, date of birth,
  6 34 social security number, and other information. Under current
  6 35 administrative rules of the state department of transportation,
  7  1 an applicant for a license or card is required to provide proof
  7  2 of lawful status in the United States. Also under current
  7  3 administrative rules, a person's signature for a driver's
  7  4 license or nonoperator's identification card application is
  7  5 required to be captured electronically. Under current law,
  7  6 a county treasurer's office participating in county issuance
  7  7 of driver's licenses is required to participate in voter
  7  8 registration to the same extent as a license facility of the
  7  9 state department of transportation.
  7 10    The bill requires the state registrar of voters to transmit
  7 11 the electronic records and electronic signatures to the county
  7 12 commissioner of registration of the county where the person
  7 13 resides. The bill requires that the county commissioner review
  7 14 the electronic record and any other relevant information to
  7 15 determine if a person is an eligible elector. If the county
  7 16 commissioner determines a person to be an eligible elector
  7 17 and the person is not registered to vote in the county, the
  7 18 county commissioner is required to notify the person of the
  7 19 separate processes to decline to register to vote or to declare
  7 20 a political party affiliation. If a notified person fails to
  7 21 decline voter registration within 21 days after the county
  7 22 commissioner issued the notification, the bill provides that
  7 23 the electronic record and electronic signature shall constitute
  7 24 a completed voter registration form for that person and the
  7 25 bill requires the county commissioner to register the person to
  7 26 vote in that county and send the person an acknowledgment as
  7 27 required by current law.
  7 28    The bill prohibits a county commissioner from adding a
  7 29 person's name to a voter registration list until at least 21
  7 30 days after the commissioner has issued notification to the
  7 31 person. The bill requires that a county commissioner send an
  7 32 acknowledgment of registration within seven business days of
  7 33 registering a person under the bill. The bill also provides
  7 34 that the electronic record and electronic signature of a person
  7 35 who does not qualify as an eligible elector does not constitute
  8  1 a completed voter registration form. Under the bill, such a
  8  2 person submitting an application for a license or card will
  8  3 not be subject to charges for voter registration fraud under
  8  4 section 39A.2 for submitting such an application.
  8  5    The bill also grants the state voter registration commission
  8  6 the authority to adopt rules to administer and interpret the
  8  7 provisions of the bill relating to voter registration at motor
  8  8 vehicle driver's license stations.  If interpretive rulemaking
  8  9 authority is clearly vested in the discretion of an agency by
  8 10 statute, the applicable judicial standard of review is whether
  8 11 the rules constitute an irrational, illogical, or wholly
  8 12 unjustifiable interpretation of law by the agency (Code section
  8 13 17A.19(10)(l)). If interpretive rulemaking authority is not
  8 14 clearly vested in the discretion of an agency, the applicable
  8 15 judicial standard of review is whether the rules constitute an
  8 16 erroneous interpretation of law (Code section 17A.19(10)(c)).
  8 17    The bill makes changes to current law related to address
  8 18 confidentiality program participants under Code chapter
  8 19 9E by requiring the state registrar to adopt rules for
  8 20 administration of registration for those participants. The
  8 21 bill maintains current law to allow for submission of a paper
  8 22 voter registration form through driver's license offices. The
  8 23 bill specifies that a requirement that separate registration
  8 24 forms be signed by each individual registrant only applies to
  8 25 paper registration forms. Under the bill, driver's license
  8 26 offices are required to transmit voter registration forms
  8 27 to the appropriate county commissioner and to transmit all
  8 28 electronic records and electronic signatures to the state
  8 29 registrar of voters.
  8 30    The bill provides that the state voter registration
  8 31 commission and the department of transportation may adopt
  8 32 emergency rules to implement the provisions of the bill. Under
  8 33 current law, the state registrar of voters is required to
  8 34 establish rules regulating transmission of voter registration
  8 35 forms from driver's license stations. Under the bill, such
  9  1 rules are required to be established by the state commission.
  9  2    The bill may include a state mandate as defined in Code
  9  3 section 25B.3.  The bill makes inapplicable Code section 25B.2,
  9  4 subsection 3, which would relieve a political subdivision from
  9  5 complying with a state mandate if funding for the cost of
  9  6 the state mandate is not provided or specified.  Therefore,
  9  7 political subdivisions are required to comply with any state
  9  8 mandate included in the bill.

  8  8 vehicle driver's license stations.  If interpretive rulemaking
  8  9 authority is clearly vested in the discretion of an agency by

  8 11 the rules constitute an irrational, illogical, or wholly
  8 12 unjustifiable interpretation of law by the agency (Code section
  8 13 17A.19(10)(l)). If interpretive rulemaking authority is not

  7 17 and the person is not registered to vote in the county, the
  7 18 county commissioner is required to notify the person of the
