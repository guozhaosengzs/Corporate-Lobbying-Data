  8 28    Sec. 10.    8 28    Sec. 10.    8 29 contracting state ==== tax considerations.
  8 30    1.  The general assembly acknowledges that section 529A of
  8 31 the Internal Revenue Code permits access to qualified ABLE
  8 32 programs by residents of a state without such a program.  The
  8 33 general assembly finds that becoming a contracting state may
  8 34 accomplish the public purpose set forth in section 12I.1,
  8 35 subsection 1, in the same manner as if the qualified ABLE
  9  1 program under the Iowa ABLE savings plan trust were to be
  9  2 implemented and administered by this state.  To that end,
  9  3 the treasurer of state, as trustee of the trust, may defer
  9  4 implementation of the qualified ABLE program under the trust
  9  5 and alternatively cause this state to become a contracting
  9  6 state by entering into an agreement with another state with a
  9  7 qualified ABLE program to provide Iowa residents access to that
  9  8 state's qualified ABLE program.  The trust shall not enter into
  9  9 an agreement pursuant to this section unless the treasurer,
  9 10 as trustee of the trust, determines that all of the following
  9 11 requirements are satisfied:
  9 12    a.  The program is a qualified ABLE program.
  9 13    b.  The qualified ABLE program provides comparable benefits
  9 14 and protections to Iowa residents as would be provided under
  9 15 the Iowa ABLE savings plan trust.
  9 16    c.  That entering into an agreement for access to the
  9 17 qualified ABLE program would not result in increased costs to
  9 18 the state or to account owners and designated beneficiaries as
  9 19 compared to the costs of implementing and administering the
  9 20 qualified ABLE program under the Iowa ABLE savings plan trust.
  9 21    d.  The qualified ABLE program will be audited annually by
  9 22 an independent certified public accountant or by the state
  9 23 auditor, or similar public official, of the state that has
  9 24 implemented the qualified ABLE program.
  9 25    e.  The qualified ABLE program will provide information to
  9 26 the treasurer of state as trustee of the trust so as to allow
  9 27 the trustee to fulfill the reporting requirements in section
  9 28 12I.7.
  9 29    2.  a.  The maximum amount that may be deducted for Iowa
  9 30 income tax purposes for contributions to the qualified ABLE
  9 31 program with which the state has contracted pursuant to
  9 32 this section shall not exceed the maximum deductible amount
  9 33 determined for the year pursuant to section 12D.3, subsection
  9 34 1, paragraph "a".  This maximum amount applies per designated
  9 35 beneficiary that is a resident of this state per year.
 10  1    b.  State income tax treatment of the qualified ABLE program
 10  2 with which the state has contracted pursuant to this section
 10  3 shall be as provided in section 422.7, subsections 34 and 34A.
 10  4    3.  State inheritance tax treatment of interests in the
 10  5 qualified ABLE program with which the state has contracted
 10  6 pursuant to this section shall be as provided in section 450.4,
 10  7 subsection 9.
 10  8    Sec. 11.    8 30    1.  The general assembly acknowledges that section 529A of

  9 11 requirements are satisfied:
  9 12    a.  The program is a qualified ABLE program.
  9 13    b.  The qualified ABLE program provides comparable benefits
  9 14 and protections to Iowa residents as would be provided under
  9 15 the Iowa ABLE savings plan trust.
  9 16    c.  That entering into an agreement for access to the
  9 17 qualified ABLE program would not result in increased costs to
  9 18 the state or to account owners and designated beneficiaries as
  9 19 compared to the costs of implementing and administering the
  9 20 qualified ABLE program under the Iowa ABLE savings plan trust.
  9 21    d.  The qualified ABLE program will be audited annually by
  9 22 an independent certified public accountant or by the state
  9 23 auditor, or similar public official, of the state that has
  9 24 implemented the qualified ABLE program.
  9 25    e.  The qualified ABLE program will provide information to
  9 26 the treasurer of state as trustee of the trust so as to allow
  9 27 the trustee to fulfill the reporting requirements in section

 11 20                           EXPLANATION
 11 21 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
 11 22 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
 11 23    This bill creates an Iowa ABLE (Achieving A Better Life
 11 24 Experience) savings plan trust and provides for various Iowa
 11 25 individual income tax and inheritance tax benefits.
 11 26    BACKGROUND.  On December 19, 2014, the federal Achieving
 11 27 A Better Life Experience Act of 2014 (ABLE Act) was enacted
 11 28 as part of the federal Tax Increase Prevention Act of 2014
 11 29 (Pub. L. No. 113=295).  The ABLE Act allows states to create
 11 30 programs to assist individuals in saving private funds for
 11 31 the purpose of supporting individuals with disabilities.
 11 32 Qualifying state programs will allow for the establishment
 11 33 of accounts into which eligible disabled individuals or
 11 34 others may make contributions for the payment of future
 11 35 disability=related expenses of the eligible disabled
 12  1 individual.  Funds and earnings in accounts established
 12  2 under qualifying state programs are afforded federal benefits
 12  3 in certain circumstances, including federal tax exemption,
 12  4 bankruptcy protection, and exclusion from consideration under
 12  5 certain means=tested programs, such as Medicaid or supplemental
 12  6 security income.
 12  7    IOWA ABLE SAVINGS PLAN TRUST.  The bill creates the Iowa
 12  8 ABLE savings plan trust (trust) under the treasurer of state
 12  9 (state treasurer) that will meet the requirements of {529A of
 12 10 the Internal Revenue Code (federal ABLE program).  The state
 12 11 treasurer is the trustee of the trust and has numerous powers,
 12 12 as specified in the bill, for the purpose of carrying out the
 12 13 purpose of the trust.
 12 14    The trust is authorized to enter into participation
 12 15 agreements with individuals for the payment of future qualified
 12 16 disability expenses, and to enter into contracts with other
 12 17 states (contracting state) to allow these states' residents
 12 18 access to the Iowa ABLE program.  "Qualified disability
 12 19 expenses" means the same as defined under the federal ABLE
 12 20 program, which generally defines the term to include expenses
 12 21 related to a designated beneficiary's education, housing,
 12 22 transportation, employment training and support, assistive
 12 23 technology and personal support services, health, prevention
 12 24 and wellness, financial management and administrative services,
 12 25 legal fees, expenses for oversight and monitoring, funeral and
 12 26 burial expenses, and other expenses approved by the secretary
 12 27 of the United States treasury (secretary).
 12 28    Unless otherwise allowed under the federal ABLE program,
 12 29 the person with whom the state treasurer enters into a
 12 30 participation agreement must be both the account owner and
 12 31 designated beneficiary.  However, the bill allows a trustee
 12 32 or legal guardian to be designated as custodian of an account
 12 33 for a designated beneficiary who is a minor or who lacks
 12 34 capacity to enter into a participation agreement, provided such
 12 35 designation would be allowed under the federal ABLE program.
 13  1 "Designated beneficiary" is defined in the bill as a person who
 13  2 is a resident of Iowa or a contracting state and who qualifies
 13  3 as an eligible individual under the federal ABLE program, which
 13  4 includes individuals who are entitled to benefits based on
 13  5 blindness or disability under Title II (disability insurance)
 13  6 or Title XVI (supplemental security income) of the federal
 13  7 Social Security Act if such blindness or disability occurred
 13  8 before attaining 26 years of age, and if such individual files
 13  9 a disability certification with the secretary.
 13 10    The bill requires the state treasurer to maintain a separate
 13 11 account in the trust for each designated beneficiary of a
 13 12 participation agreement.  Unless otherwise allowed under the
 13 13 federal ABLE program, only one participation agreement shall be
 13 14 allowed per designated beneficiary.  Any person is allowed to
 13 15 make contributions in the form of cash to an account on behalf
 13 16 of a designated beneficiary.  The trust is required to maintain
 13 17 limits on the annual contributions to an account, and the
 13 18 aggregate balance in an account, matching those set forth in
 13 19 the federal ABLE program, which prohibits annual contributions
 13 20 to an account from exceeding the annual gift tax exclusion
 13 21 amount ($14,000 for 2015), and prohibits an aggregate account
 13 22 balance from exceeding the limit set by a state under its
 13 23 qualified tuition program (currently $320,000 for Iowa).
 13 24    The bill also permits the treasurer of state to defer
 13 25 implementation of the Iowa ABLE program and alternatively enter
 13 26 into an agreement with another state's qualified ABLE program
 13 27 to provide Iowa residents access to that state's program, if
 13 28 certain requirements specified in the bill are satisfied.
 13 29    The bill provides other various terms and conditions for
 13 30 participation agreements, use and segregation of trust funds,
 13 31 cancellation of agreements and refund of account balances,
 13 32 and ownership rights in the trust.  The bill provides that an
 13 33 account may be claimed by the Iowa Medicaid program upon the
 13 34 death of the designated beneficiary, in accordance with the
 13 35 federal ABLE program.  The bill requires the state treasurer to
 14  1 prepare and submit audited financial reports to the governor
 14  2 and general assembly, and further requires the state treasurer
 14  3 to comply with any reporting requirements of the federal ABLE
 14  4 program. The bill applies to qualified disability expenses
 14  5 incurred on or after July 1, 2015.
 14  6    IOWA TAX BENEFITS.  The bill provides several tax benefits
 14  7 under the trust.  First, the value of any interest in the
 14  8 trust or other contracted state's qualified ABLE program
 14  9 of a decedent who was an Iowa resident dying on or after
 14 10 January 1, 2016, is excluded from the Iowa inheritance tax.
 14 11 Second, contributions to the trust or other contracted state's
 14 12 qualified ABLE program made on or after January 1, 2016, on
 14 13 behalf of a designated beneficiary who is an Iowa resident
 14 14 are deductible from the Iowa individual income tax up to the
 14 15 maximum amount allowed per beneficiary per year for purposes
 14 16 of the Iowa educational savings plan trust in Code chapter
 14 17 12D.  For 2015, that amount is set at $3,163.  Any amounts
 14 18 refunded to a taxpayer from the cancellation of a participation
 14 19 agreement or that are withdrawn for purposes other than the
 14 20 payment of qualified disability expenses of the designated
 14 21 beneficiary must be included in Iowa net income to the extent
 14 22 they were previously deducted by the taxpayer or any other
 14 23 person as a contribution.  Third, income and earnings from the
 14 24 trust or received by resident account owners from a contracted
 14 25 state's qualified ABLE program are exempt from the Iowa
 14 26 individual income tax.  The individual income tax benefits
 14 27 apply to tax years beginning on or after January 1, 2016.
 14 28    CONTINGENT IMPLEMENTATION.  The implementation of the bill
 14 29 is subject to an appropriation with the purpose of the trust
 14 30 stated.

 12  1 individual.  Funds and earnings in accounts established
 12  2 under qualifying state programs are afforded federal benefits
 12  3 in certain circumstances, including federal tax exemption,
 12  4 bankruptcy protection, and exclusion from consideration under
 12  5 certain means=tested programs, such as Medicaid or supplemental
 12  6 security income.
 12  7    IOWA ABLE SAVINGS PLAN TRUST.  The bill creates the Iowa
 12  8 ABLE savings plan trust (trust) under the treasurer of state
 12  9 (state treasurer) that will meet the requirements of {529A of
 12 10 the Internal Revenue Code (federal ABLE program).  The state
 12 11 treasurer is the trustee of the trust and has numerous powers,
 12 12 as specified in the bill, for the purpose of carrying out the
 12 13 purpose of the trust.
 12 14    The trust is authorized to enter into participation
 12 15 agreements with individuals for the payment of future qualified
 12 16 disability expenses, and to enter into contracts with other
 12 17 states (contracting state) to allow these states' residents
 12 18 access to the Iowa ABLE program.  "Qualified disability
 12 19 expenses" means the same as defined under the federal ABLE
 12 20 program, which generally defines the term to include expenses
 12 21 related to a designated beneficiary's education, housing,
 12 22 transportation, employment training and support, assistive
 12 23 technology and personal support services, health, prevention
 12 24 and wellness, financial management and administrative services,
 12 25 legal fees, expenses for oversight and monitoring, funeral and
 12 26 burial expenses, and other expenses approved by the secretary
 12 27 of the United States treasury (secretary).
 12 28    Unless otherwise allowed under the federal ABLE program,
 12 29 the person with whom the state treasurer enters into a
 12 30 participation agreement must be both the account owner and
 12 31 designated beneficiary.  However, the bill allows a trustee
 12 32 or legal guardian to be designated as custodian of an account
 12 33 for a designated beneficiary who is a minor or who lacks
 12 34 capacity to enter into a participation agreement, provided such
 12 35 designation would be allowed under the federal ABLE program.
 13  1 "Designated beneficiary" is defined in the bill as a person who
 13  2 is a resident of Iowa or a contracting state and who qualifies
 13  3 as an eligible individual under the federal ABLE program, which
 13  4 includes individuals who are entitled to benefits based on
 13  5 blindness or disability under Title II (disability insurance)
 13  6 or Title XVI (supplemental security income) of the federal
 13  7 Social Security Act if such blindness or disability occurred
 13  8 before attaining 26 years of age, and if such individual files
 13  9 a disability certification with the secretary.
 13 10    The bill requires the state treasurer to maintain a separate
 13 11 account in the trust for each designated beneficiary of a
 13 12 participation agreement.  Unless otherwise allowed under the
 13 13 federal ABLE program, only one participation agreement shall be
 13 14 allowed per designated beneficiary.  Any person is allowed to
 13 15 make contributions in the form of cash to an account on behalf
 13 16 of a designated beneficiary.  The trust is required to maintain
 13 17 limits on the annual contributions to an account, and the
 13 18 aggregate balance in an account, matching those set forth in
 13 19 the federal ABLE program, which prohibits annual contributions
 13 20 to an account from exceeding the annual gift tax exclusion
 13 21 amount ($14,000 for 2015), and prohibits an aggregate account
 13 22 balance from exceeding the limit set by a state under its
 13 23 qualified tuition program (currently $320,000 for Iowa).
 13 24    The bill also permits the treasurer of state to defer
 13 25 implementation of the Iowa ABLE program and alternatively enter
 13 26 into an agreement with another state's qualified ABLE program
 13 27 to provide Iowa residents access to that state's program, if
 13 28 certain requirements specified in the bill are satisfied.
 13 29    The bill provides other various terms and conditions for
 13 30 participation agreements, use and segregation of trust funds,
 13 31 cancellation of agreements and refund of account balances,
 13 32 and ownership rights in the trust.  The bill provides that an
 13 33 account may be claimed by the Iowa Medicaid program upon the
 13 34 death of the designated beneficiary, in accordance with the
 13 35 federal ABLE program.  The bill requires the state treasurer to
 14  1 prepare and submit audited financial reports to the governor
 14  2 and general assembly, and further requires the state treasurer
 14  3 to comply with any reporting requirements of the federal ABLE
 14  4 program. The bill applies to qualified disability expenses
 14  5 incurred on or after July 1, 2015.
 14  6    IOWA TAX BENEFITS.  The bill provides several tax benefits
 14  7 under the trust.  First, the value of any interest in the
 14  8 trust or other contracted state's qualified ABLE program
 14  9 of a decedent who was an Iowa resident dying on or after
 14 10 January 1, 2016, is excluded from the Iowa inheritance tax.
 14 11 Second, contributions to the trust or other contracted state's
 14 12 qualified ABLE program made on or after January 1, 2016, on
 14 13 behalf of a designated beneficiary who is an Iowa resident

 14 15 maximum amount allowed per beneficiary per year for purposes
 14 16 of the Iowa educational savings plan trust in Code chapter
 14 17 12D.  For 2015, that amount is set at $3,163.  Any amounts
 14 18 refunded to a taxpayer from the cancellation of a participation
 14 19 agreement or that are withdrawn for purposes other than the
 14 20 payment of qualified disability expenses of the designated
 14 21 beneficiary must be included in Iowa net income to the extent
 14 22 they were previously deducted by the taxpayer or any other
 14 23 person as a contribution.  Third, income and earnings from the
 14 24 trust or received by resident account owners from a contracted
 14 25 state's qualified ABLE program are exempt from the Iowa
 14 26 individual income tax.  The individual income tax benefits
 14 27 apply to tax years beginning on or after January 1, 2016.

 12 29 the person with whom the state treasurer enters into a
 12 30 participation agreement must be both the account owner and

 12  9 (state treasurer) that will meet the requirements of {529A of
 12 10 the Internal Revenue Code (federal ABLE program).  The state
 12 11 treasurer is the trustee of the trust and has numerous powers,

 12 13 purpose of the trust.
 12 14    The trust is authorized to enter into participation

 12 16 disability expenses, and to enter into contracts with other
 12 17 states (contracting state) to allow these states' residents

 11 25 individual income tax and inheritance tax benefits.
 11 26    BACKGROUND.  On December 19, 2014, the federal Achieving
 11 27 A Better Life Experience Act of 2014 (ABLE Act) was enacted
 11 28 as part of the federal Tax Increase Prevention Act of 2014

 11 33 of accounts into which eligible disabled individuals or
 11 34 others may make contributions for the payment of future

 12  4 bankruptcy protection, and exclusion from consideration under
 12  5 certain means=tested programs, such as Medicaid or supplemental

 12  7    IOWA ABLE SAVINGS PLAN TRUST.  The bill creates the Iowa
 12  8 ABLE savings plan trust (trust) under the treasurer of state

 12 35 designation would be allowed under the federal ABLE program.
 13  1 "Designated beneficiary" is defined in the bill as a person who
 13  2 is a resident of Iowa or a contracting state and who qualifies
 13  3 as an eligible individual under the federal ABLE program, which
 13  4 includes individuals who are entitled to benefits based on
 13  5 blindness or disability under Title II (disability insurance)
 13  6 or Title XVI (supplemental security income) of the federal
 13  7 Social Security Act if such blindness or disability occurred
 13  8 before attaining 26 years of age, and if such individual files
 13  9 a disability certification with the secretary.
 13 10    The bill requires the state treasurer to maintain a separate
 13 11 account in the trust for each designated beneficiary of a
 13 12 participation agreement.  Unless otherwise allowed under the
 13 13 federal ABLE program, only one participation agreement shall be
 13 14 allowed per designated beneficiary.  Any person is allowed to
 13 15 make contributions in the form of cash to an account on behalf
 13 16 of a designated beneficiary.  The trust is required to maintain
 13 17 limits on the annual contributions to an account, and the
 13 18 aggregate balance in an account, matching those set forth in
 13 19 the federal ABLE program, which prohibits annual contributions
 13 20 to an account from exceeding the annual gift tax exclusion
 13 21 amount ($14,000 for 2015), and prohibits an aggregate account
 13 22 balance from exceeding the limit set by a state under its
 13 23 qualified tuition program (currently $320,000 for Iowa).
 13 24    The bill also permits the treasurer of state to defer
 13 25 implementation of the Iowa ABLE program and alternatively enter
 13 26 into an agreement with another state's qualified ABLE program
 13 27 to provide Iowa residents access to that state's program, if
 13 28 certain requirements specified in the bill are satisfied.
 13 29    The bill provides other various terms and conditions for
 13 30 participation agreements, use and segregation of trust funds,
 13 31 cancellation of agreements and refund of account balances,
 13 32 and ownership rights in the trust.  The bill provides that an
 13 33 account may be claimed by the Iowa Medicaid program upon the
 13 34 death of the designated beneficiary, in accordance with the
 13 35 federal ABLE program.  The bill requires the state treasurer to
 14  1 prepare and submit audited financial reports to the governor
 14  2 and general assembly, and further requires the state treasurer
 14  3 to comply with any reporting requirements of the federal ABLE
 14  4 program. The bill applies to qualified disability expenses
 14  5 incurred on or after July 1, 2015.
 14  6    IOWA TAX BENEFITS.  The bill provides several tax benefits
 14  7 under the trust.  First, the value of any interest in the
 14  8 trust or other contracted state's qualified ABLE program
 14  9 of a decedent who was an Iowa resident dying on or after
 14 10 January 1, 2016, is excluded from the Iowa inheritance tax.
 14 11 Second, contributions to the trust or other contracted state's
 14 12 qualified ABLE program made on or after January 1, 2016, on
 14 13 behalf of a designated beneficiary who is an Iowa resident
 14 14 are deductible from the Iowa individual income tax up to the
 14 15 maximum amount allowed per beneficiary per year for purposes
 14 16 of the Iowa educational savings plan trust in Code chapter
 14 17 12D.  For 2015, that amount is set at $3,163.  Any amounts
 14 18 refunded to a taxpayer from the cancellation of a participation
 14 19 agreement or that are withdrawn for purposes other than the
 14 20 payment of qualified disability expenses of the designated
 14 21 beneficiary must be included in Iowa net income to the extent
 14 22 they were previously deducted by the taxpayer or any other
 14 23 person as a contribution.  Third, income and earnings from the
 14 24 trust or received by resident account owners from a contracted
 14 25 state's qualified ABLE program are exempt from the Iowa
 14 26 individual income tax.  The individual income tax benefits
 14 27 apply to tax years beginning on or after January 1, 2016.
 14 28    CONTINGENT IMPLEMENTATION.  The implementation of the bill
 14 29 is subject to an appropriation with the purpose of the trust

 11 21 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
 11 22 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
 11 23    This bill creates an Iowa ABLE (Achieving A Better Life
 11 24 Experience) savings plan trust and provides for various Iowa
 11 25 individual income tax and inheritance tax benefits.
 11 26    BACKGROUND.  On December 19, 2014, the federal Achieving
 11 27 A Better Life Experience Act of 2014 (ABLE Act) was enacted
 11 28 as part of the federal Tax Increase Prevention Act of 2014
 11 29 (Pub. L. No. 113=295).  The ABLE Act allows states to create
 11 30 programs to assist individuals in saving private funds for
 11 31 the purpose of supporting individuals with disabilities.
 11 32 Qualifying state programs will allow for the establishment
 11 33 of accounts into which eligible disabled individuals or
 11 34 others may make contributions for the payment of future
 11 35 disability=related expenses of the eligible disabled
 12  1 individual.  Funds and earnings in accounts established
 12  2 under qualifying state programs are afforded federal benefits
 12  3 in certain circumstances, including federal tax exemption,
 12  4 bankruptcy protection, and exclusion from consideration under
 12  5 certain means=tested programs, such as Medicaid or supplemental
 12  6 security income.
 12  7    IOWA ABLE SAVINGS PLAN TRUST.  The bill creates the Iowa
 12  8 ABLE savings plan trust (trust) under the treasurer of state
 12  9 (state treasurer) that will meet the requirements of {529A of
 12 10 the Internal Revenue Code (federal ABLE program).  The state
 12 11 treasurer is the trustee of the trust and has numerous powers,
 12 12 as specified in the bill, for the purpose of carrying out the
 12 13 purpose of the trust.
 12 14    The trust is authorized to enter into participation
 12 15 agreements with individuals for the payment of future qualified
 12 16 disability expenses, and to enter into contracts with other
 12 17 states (contracting state) to allow these states' residents
 12 18 access to the Iowa ABLE program.  "Qualified disability
 12 19 expenses" means the same as defined under the federal ABLE
 12 20 program, which generally defines the term to include expenses
 12 21 related to a designated beneficiary's education, housing,
 12 22 transportation, employment training and support, assistive
 12 23 technology and personal support services, health, prevention
 12 24 and wellness, financial management and administrative services,
 12 25 legal fees, expenses for oversight and monitoring, funeral and
 12 26 burial expenses, and other expenses approved by the secretary
 12 27 of the United States treasury (secretary).
 12 28    Unless otherwise allowed under the federal ABLE program,
 12 29 the person with whom the state treasurer enters into a
 12 30 participation agreement must be both the account owner and
 12 31 designated beneficiary.  However, the bill allows a trustee
 12 32 or legal guardian to be designated as custodian of an account
 12 33 for a designated beneficiary who is a minor or who lacks
 12 34 capacity to enter into a participation agreement, provided such
 12 35 designation would be allowed under the federal ABLE program.
 13  1 "Designated beneficiary" is defined in the bill as a person who
 13  2 is a resident of Iowa or a contracting state and who qualifies
 13  3 as an eligible individual under the federal ABLE program, which
 13  4 includes individuals who are entitled to benefits based on
 13  5 blindness or disability under Title II (disability insurance)
 13  6 or Title XVI (supplemental security income) of the federal
 13  7 Social Security Act if such blindness or disability occurred
 13  8 before attaining 26 years of age, and if such individual files
 13  9 a disability certification with the secretary.
 13 10    The bill requires the state treasurer to maintain a separate
 13 11 account in the trust for each designated beneficiary of a
 13 12 participation agreement.  Unless otherwise allowed under the
 13 13 federal ABLE program, only one participation agreement shall be
 13 14 allowed per designated beneficiary.  Any person is allowed to
 13 15 make contributions in the form of cash to an account on behalf
 13 16 of a designated beneficiary.  The trust is required to maintain
 13 17 limits on the annual contributions to an account, and the
 13 18 aggregate balance in an account, matching those set forth in
 13 19 the federal ABLE program, which prohibits annual contributions
 13 20 to an account from exceeding the annual gift tax exclusion
 13 21 amount ($14,000 for 2015), and prohibits an aggregate account
 13 22 balance from exceeding the limit set by a state under its
 13 23 qualified tuition program (currently $320,000 for Iowa).
 13 24    The bill also permits the treasurer of state to defer
 13 25 implementation of the Iowa ABLE program and alternatively enter
 13 26 into an agreement with another state's qualified ABLE program
 13 27 to provide Iowa residents access to that state's program, if
 13 28 certain requirements specified in the bill are satisfied.
 13 29    The bill provides other various terms and conditions for
 13 30 participation agreements, use and segregation of trust funds,
 13 31 cancellation of agreements and refund of account balances,
 13 32 and ownership rights in the trust.  The bill provides that an
 13 33 account may be claimed by the Iowa Medicaid program upon the
 13 34 death of the designated beneficiary, in accordance with the
 13 35 federal ABLE program.  The bill requires the state treasurer to
 14  1 prepare and submit audited financial reports to the governor
 14  2 and general assembly, and further requires the state treasurer
 14  3 to comply with any reporting requirements of the federal ABLE
 14  4 program. The bill applies to qualified disability expenses
 14  5 incurred on or after July 1, 2015.
 14  6    IOWA TAX BENEFITS.  The bill provides several tax benefits
 14  7 under the trust.  First, the value of any interest in the
 14  8 trust or other contracted state's qualified ABLE program
 14  9 of a decedent who was an Iowa resident dying on or after
 14 10 January 1, 2016, is excluded from the Iowa inheritance tax.
 14 11 Second, contributions to the trust or other contracted state's
 14 12 qualified ABLE program made on or after January 1, 2016, on
 14 13 behalf of a designated beneficiary who is an Iowa resident
 14 14 are deductible from the Iowa individual income tax up to the
 14 15 maximum amount allowed per beneficiary per year for purposes
 14 16 of the Iowa educational savings plan trust in Code chapter
 14 17 12D.  For 2015, that amount is set at $3,163.  Any amounts
 14 18 refunded to a taxpayer from the cancellation of a participation
 14 19 agreement or that are withdrawn for purposes other than the
 14 20 payment of qualified disability expenses of the designated
 14 21 beneficiary must be included in Iowa net income to the extent
 14 22 they were previously deducted by the taxpayer or any other
 14 23 person as a contribution.  Third, income and earnings from the
 14 24 trust or received by resident account owners from a contracted
 14 25 state's qualified ABLE program are exempt from the Iowa
 14 26 individual income tax.  The individual income tax benefits
 14 27 apply to tax years beginning on or after January 1, 2016.
 14 28    CONTINGENT IMPLEMENTATION.  The implementation of the bill

 12  7    IOWA ABLE SAVINGS PLAN TRUST.  The bill creates the Iowa
 12  8 ABLE savings plan trust (trust) under the treasurer of state
 12  9 (state treasurer) that will meet the requirements of {529A of
 12 10 the Internal Revenue Code (federal ABLE program).  The state
 12 11 treasurer is the trustee of the trust and has numerous powers,
 12 12 as specified in the bill, for the purpose of carrying out the
 12 13 purpose of the trust.
 12 14    The trust is authorized to enter into participation
 12 15 agreements with individuals for the payment of future qualified
 12 16 disability expenses, and to enter into contracts with other
 12 17 states (contracting state) to allow these states' residents

 12 33 for a designated beneficiary who is a minor or who lacks

 13  7 Social Security Act if such blindness or disability occurred
 13  8 before attaining 26 years of age, and if such individual files
 13  9 a disability certification with the secretary.
 13 10    The bill requires the state treasurer to maintain a separate

 13 14 allowed per designated beneficiary.  Any person is allowed to
 13 15 make contributions in the form of cash to an account on behalf

 11 21 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
 11 22 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
 11 23    This bill creates an Iowa ABLE (Achieving A Better Life
 11 24 Experience) savings plan trust and provides for various Iowa
 11 25 individual income tax and inheritance tax benefits.
 11 26    BACKGROUND.  On December 19, 2014, the federal Achieving
 11 27 A Better Life Experience Act of 2014 (ABLE Act) was enacted
 11 28 as part of the federal Tax Increase Prevention Act of 2014
 11 29 (Pub. L. No. 113=295).  The ABLE Act allows states to create
 11 30 programs to assist individuals in saving private funds for
 11 31 the purpose of supporting individuals with disabilities.
 11 32 Qualifying state programs will allow for the establishment
 11 33 of accounts into which eligible disabled individuals or
 11 34 others may make contributions for the payment of future
 11 35 disability=related expenses of the eligible disabled
 12  1 individual.  Funds and earnings in accounts established
 12  2 under qualifying state programs are afforded federal benefits
 12  3 in certain circumstances, including federal tax exemption,
 12  4 bankruptcy protection, and exclusion from consideration under
 12  5 certain means=tested programs, such as Medicaid or supplemental
 12  6 security income.
 12  7    IOWA ABLE SAVINGS PLAN TRUST.  The bill creates the Iowa
 12  8 ABLE savings plan trust (trust) under the treasurer of state
 12  9 (state treasurer) that will meet the requirements of {529A of
 12 10 the Internal Revenue Code (federal ABLE program).  The state
 12 11 treasurer is the trustee of the trust and has numerous powers,
 12 12 as specified in the bill, for the purpose of carrying out the
 12 13 purpose of the trust.
 12 14    The trust is authorized to enter into participation
 12 15 agreements with individuals for the payment of future qualified
 12 16 disability expenses, and to enter into contracts with other
 12 17 states (contracting state) to allow these states' residents
 12 18 access to the Iowa ABLE program.  "Qualified disability
 12 19 expenses" means the same as defined under the federal ABLE
 12 20 program, which generally defines the term to include expenses
 12 21 related to a designated beneficiary's education, housing,
 12 22 transportation, employment training and support, assistive
 12 23 technology and personal support services, health, prevention
 12 24 and wellness, financial management and administrative services,
 12 25 legal fees, expenses for oversight and monitoring, funeral and
 12 26 burial expenses, and other expenses approved by the secretary
 12 27 of the United States treasury (secretary).
 12 28    Unless otherwise allowed under the federal ABLE program,
 12 29 the person with whom the state treasurer enters into a
 12 30 participation agreement must be both the account owner and
 12 31 designated beneficiary.  However, the bill allows a trustee
 12 32 or legal guardian to be designated as custodian of an account
 12 33 for a designated beneficiary who is a minor or who lacks
 12 34 capacity to enter into a participation agreement, provided such
 12 35 designation would be allowed under the federal ABLE program.
 13  1 "Designated beneficiary" is defined in the bill as a person who
 13  2 is a resident of Iowa or a contracting state and who qualifies
 13  3 as an eligible individual under the federal ABLE program, which
 13  4 includes individuals who are entitled to benefits based on
 13  5 blindness or disability under Title II (disability insurance)
 13  6 or Title XVI (supplemental security income) of the federal
 13  7 Social Security Act if such blindness or disability occurred
 13  8 before attaining 26 years of age, and if such individual files
 13  9 a disability certification with the secretary.
 13 10    The bill requires the state treasurer to maintain a separate
 13 11 account in the trust for each designated beneficiary of a
 13 12 participation agreement.  Unless otherwise allowed under the
 13 13 federal ABLE program, only one participation agreement shall be
 13 14 allowed per designated beneficiary.  Any person is allowed to
 13 15 make contributions in the form of cash to an account on behalf
 13 16 of a designated beneficiary.  The trust is required to maintain
 13 17 limits on the annual contributions to an account, and the
 13 18 aggregate balance in an account, matching those set forth in
 13 19 the federal ABLE program, which prohibits annual contributions
 13 20 to an account from exceeding the annual gift tax exclusion
 13 21 amount ($14,000 for 2015), and prohibits an aggregate account
 13 22 balance from exceeding the limit set by a state under its
 13 23 qualified tuition program (currently $320,000 for Iowa).
 13 24    The bill also permits the treasurer of state to defer
 13 25 implementation of the Iowa ABLE program and alternatively enter
 13 26 into an agreement with another state's qualified ABLE program
 13 27 to provide Iowa residents access to that state's program, if
 13 28 certain requirements specified in the bill are satisfied.
 13 29    The bill provides other various terms and conditions for
 13 30 participation agreements, use and segregation of trust funds,
 13 31 cancellation of agreements and refund of account balances,
 13 32 and ownership rights in the trust.  The bill provides that an
 13 33 account may be claimed by the Iowa Medicaid program upon the
 13 34 death of the designated beneficiary, in accordance with the
 13 35 federal ABLE program.  The bill requires the state treasurer to
 14  1 prepare and submit audited financial reports to the governor
 14  2 and general assembly, and further requires the state treasurer
 14  3 to comply with any reporting requirements of the federal ABLE
 14  4 program. The bill applies to qualified disability expenses
 14  5 incurred on or after July 1, 2015.
 14  6    IOWA TAX BENEFITS.  The bill provides several tax benefits

 11 20                           EXPLANATION
 11 21 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
 11 22 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
 11 23    This bill creates an Iowa ABLE (Achieving A Better Life
 11 24 Experience) savings plan trust and provides for various Iowa
 11 25 individual income tax and inheritance tax benefits.
 11 26    BACKGROUND.  On December 19, 2014, the federal Achieving
 11 27 A Better Life Experience Act of 2014 (ABLE Act) was enacted
 11 28 as part of the federal Tax Increase Prevention Act of 2014
 11 29 (Pub. L. No. 113=295).  The ABLE Act allows states to create
 11 30 programs to assist individuals in saving private funds for
 11 31 the purpose of supporting individuals with disabilities.
 11 32 Qualifying state programs will allow for the establishment
 11 33 of accounts into which eligible disabled individuals or
 11 34 others may make contributions for the payment of future
 11 35 disability=related expenses of the eligible disabled
 12  1 individual.  Funds and earnings in accounts established
 12  2 under qualifying state programs are afforded federal benefits
 12  3 in certain circumstances, including federal tax exemption,
 12  4 bankruptcy protection, and exclusion from consideration under
 12  5 certain means=tested programs, such as Medicaid or supplemental
 12  6 security income.
 12  7    IOWA ABLE SAVINGS PLAN TRUST.  The bill creates the Iowa
 12  8 ABLE savings plan trust (trust) under the treasurer of state
 12  9 (state treasurer) that will meet the requirements of {529A of
 12 10 the Internal Revenue Code (federal ABLE program).  The state
 12 11 treasurer is the trustee of the trust and has numerous powers,
 12 12 as specified in the bill, for the purpose of carrying out the
 12 13 purpose of the trust.
 12 14    The trust is authorized to enter into participation
 12 15 agreements with individuals for the payment of future qualified
 12 16 disability expenses, and to enter into contracts with other
 12 17 states (contracting state) to allow these states' residents
 12 18 access to the Iowa ABLE program.  "Qualified disability
 12 19 expenses" means the same as defined under the federal ABLE
 12 20 program, which generally defines the term to include expenses
 12 21 related to a designated beneficiary's education, housing,
 12 22 transportation, employment training and support, assistive
 12 23 technology and personal support services, health, prevention
 12 24 and wellness, financial management and administrative services,
 12 25 legal fees, expenses for oversight and monitoring, funeral and
 12 26 burial expenses, and other expenses approved by the secretary
 12 27 of the United States treasury (secretary).
 12 28    Unless otherwise allowed under the federal ABLE program,
 12 29 the person with whom the state treasurer enters into a
 12 30 participation agreement must be both the account owner and
 12 31 designated beneficiary.  However, the bill allows a trustee
 12 32 or legal guardian to be designated as custodian of an account
 12 33 for a designated beneficiary who is a minor or who lacks
 12 34 capacity to enter into a participation agreement, provided such
 12 35 designation would be allowed under the federal ABLE program.
 13  1 "Designated beneficiary" is defined in the bill as a person who
 13  2 is a resident of Iowa or a contracting state and who qualifies
 13  3 as an eligible individual under the federal ABLE program, which
 13  4 includes individuals who are entitled to benefits based on
 13  5 blindness or disability under Title II (disability insurance)
 13  6 or Title XVI (supplemental security income) of the federal
 13  7 Social Security Act if such blindness or disability occurred
 13  8 before attaining 26 years of age, and if such individual files
 13  9 a disability certification with the secretary.
 13 10    The bill requires the state treasurer to maintain a separate
 13 11 account in the trust for each designated beneficiary of a
 13 12 participation agreement.  Unless otherwise allowed under the
 13 13 federal ABLE program, only one participation agreement shall be
 13 14 allowed per designated beneficiary.  Any person is allowed to
 13 15 make contributions in the form of cash to an account on behalf
 13 16 of a designated beneficiary.  The trust is required to maintain
 13 17 limits on the annual contributions to an account, and the
 13 18 aggregate balance in an account, matching those set forth in
 13 19 the federal ABLE program, which prohibits annual contributions
 13 20 to an account from exceeding the annual gift tax exclusion
 13 21 amount ($14,000 for 2015), and prohibits an aggregate account
 13 22 balance from exceeding the limit set by a state under its
 13 23 qualified tuition program (currently $320,000 for Iowa).
 13 24    The bill also permits the treasurer of state to defer
 13 25 implementation of the Iowa ABLE program and alternatively enter
 13 26 into an agreement with another state's qualified ABLE program
 13 27 to provide Iowa residents access to that state's program, if
 13 28 certain requirements specified in the bill are satisfied.
 13 29    The bill provides other various terms and conditions for
 13 30 participation agreements, use and segregation of trust funds,
 13 31 cancellation of agreements and refund of account balances,
 13 32 and ownership rights in the trust.  The bill provides that an
 13 33 account may be claimed by the Iowa Medicaid program upon the
 13 34 death of the designated beneficiary, in accordance with the
 13 35 federal ABLE program.  The bill requires the state treasurer to
 14  1 prepare and submit audited financial reports to the governor
 14  2 and general assembly, and further requires the state treasurer
 14  3 to comply with any reporting requirements of the federal ABLE
 14  4 program. The bill applies to qualified disability expenses
 14  5 incurred on or after July 1, 2015.
 14  6    IOWA TAX BENEFITS.  The bill provides several tax benefits
 14  7 under the trust.  First, the value of any interest in the
 14  8 trust or other contracted state's qualified ABLE program
 14  9 of a decedent who was an Iowa resident dying on or after
 14 10 January 1, 2016, is excluded from the Iowa inheritance tax.
 14 11 Second, contributions to the trust or other contracted state's
 14 12 qualified ABLE program made on or after January 1, 2016, on
 14 13 behalf of a designated beneficiary who is an Iowa resident
 14 14 are deductible from the Iowa individual income tax up to the
 14 15 maximum amount allowed per beneficiary per year for purposes
 14 16 of the Iowa educational savings plan trust in Code chapter
 14 17 12D.  For 2015, that amount is set at $3,163.  Any amounts
 14 18 refunded to a taxpayer from the cancellation of a participation
 14 19 agreement or that are withdrawn for purposes other than the
 14 20 payment of qualified disability expenses of the designated
 14 21 beneficiary must be included in Iowa net income to the extent
 14 22 they were previously deducted by the taxpayer or any other
 14 23 person as a contribution.  Third, income and earnings from the
 14 24 trust or received by resident account owners from a contracted
 14 25 state's qualified ABLE program are exempt from the Iowa
 14 26 individual income tax.  The individual income tax benefits
 14 27 apply to tax years beginning on or after January 1, 2016.
 14 28    CONTINGENT IMPLEMENTATION.  The implementation of the bill
 14 29 is subject to an appropriation with the purpose of the trust
 14 30 stated.

 11 20                           EXPLANATION
 11 21 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
 11 22 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
 11 23    This bill creates an Iowa ABLE (Achieving A Better Life
 11 24 Experience) savings plan trust and provides for various Iowa
 11 25 individual income tax and inheritance tax benefits.
 11 26    BACKGROUND.  On December 19, 2014, the federal Achieving
 11 27 A Better Life Experience Act of 2014 (ABLE Act) was enacted
 11 28 as part of the federal Tax Increase Prevention Act of 2014
 11 29 (Pub. L. No. 113=295).  The ABLE Act allows states to create
 11 30 programs to assist individuals in saving private funds for
 11 31 the purpose of supporting individuals with disabilities.
 11 32 Qualifying state programs will allow for the establishment
 11 33 of accounts into which eligible disabled individuals or
 11 34 others may make contributions for the payment of future
 11 35 disability=related expenses of the eligible disabled
 12  1 individual.  Funds and earnings in accounts established
 12  2 under qualifying state programs are afforded federal benefits
 12  3 in certain circumstances, including federal tax exemption,
 12  4 bankruptcy protection, and exclusion from consideration under
 12  5 certain means=tested programs, such as Medicaid or supplemental
 12  6 security income.
 12  7    IOWA ABLE SAVINGS PLAN TRUST.  The bill creates the Iowa
 12  8 ABLE savings plan trust (trust) under the treasurer of state
 12  9 (state treasurer) that will meet the requirements of {529A of
 12 10 the Internal Revenue Code (federal ABLE program).  The state
 12 11 treasurer is the trustee of the trust and has numerous powers,
 12 12 as specified in the bill, for the purpose of carrying out the
 12 13 purpose of the trust.
 12 14    The trust is authorized to enter into participation
 12 15 agreements with individuals for the payment of future qualified
 12 16 disability expenses, and to enter into contracts with other
 12 17 states (contracting state) to allow these states' residents
 12 18 access to the Iowa ABLE program.  "Qualified disability
 12 19 expenses" means the same as defined under the federal ABLE
 12 20 program, which generally defines the term to include expenses
 12 21 related to a designated beneficiary's education, housing,
 12 22 transportation, employment training and support, assistive
 12 23 technology and personal support services, health, prevention
 12 24 and wellness, financial management and administrative services,
 12 25 legal fees, expenses for oversight and monitoring, funeral and
 12 26 burial expenses, and other expenses approved by the secretary
 12 27 of the United States treasury (secretary).
 12 28    Unless otherwise allowed under the federal ABLE program,
 12 29 the person with whom the state treasurer enters into a
 12 30 participation agreement must be both the account owner and
 12 31 designated beneficiary.  However, the bill allows a trustee
 12 32 or legal guardian to be designated as custodian of an account
 12 33 for a designated beneficiary who is a minor or who lacks
 12 34 capacity to enter into a participation agreement, provided such
 12 35 designation would be allowed under the federal ABLE program.
 13  1 "Designated beneficiary" is defined in the bill as a person who
 13  2 is a resident of Iowa or a contracting state and who qualifies
 13  3 as an eligible individual under the federal ABLE program, which
 13  4 includes individuals who are entitled to benefits based on
 13  5 blindness or disability under Title II (disability insurance)
 13  6 or Title XVI (supplemental security income) of the federal
 13  7 Social Security Act if such blindness or disability occurred
 13  8 before attaining 26 years of age, and if such individual files
 13  9 a disability certification with the secretary.
 13 10    The bill requires the state treasurer to maintain a separate
 13 11 account in the trust for each designated beneficiary of a
 13 12 participation agreement.  Unless otherwise allowed under the
 13 13 federal ABLE program, only one participation agreement shall be
 13 14 allowed per designated beneficiary.  Any person is allowed to
 13 15 make contributions in the form of cash to an account on behalf
 13 16 of a designated beneficiary.  The trust is required to maintain
 13 17 limits on the annual contributions to an account, and the
 13 18 aggregate balance in an account, matching those set forth in
 13 19 the federal ABLE program, which prohibits annual contributions
 13 20 to an account from exceeding the annual gift tax exclusion
 13 21 amount ($14,000 for 2015), and prohibits an aggregate account
 13 22 balance from exceeding the limit set by a state under its
 13 23 qualified tuition program (currently $320,000 for Iowa).
 13 24    The bill also permits the treasurer of state to defer
 13 25 implementation of the Iowa ABLE program and alternatively enter
 13 26 into an agreement with another state's qualified ABLE program
 13 27 to provide Iowa residents access to that state's program, if
 13 28 certain requirements specified in the bill are satisfied.
 13 29    The bill provides other various terms and conditions for
 13 30 participation agreements, use and segregation of trust funds,
 13 31 cancellation of agreements and refund of account balances,
 13 32 and ownership rights in the trust.  The bill provides that an
 13 33 account may be claimed by the Iowa Medicaid program upon the
 13 34 death of the designated beneficiary, in accordance with the
 13 35 federal ABLE program.  The bill requires the state treasurer to
 14  1 prepare and submit audited financial reports to the governor
 14  2 and general assembly, and further requires the state treasurer
 14  3 to comply with any reporting requirements of the federal ABLE
 14  4 program. The bill applies to qualified disability expenses
 14  5 incurred on or after July 1, 2015.
 14  6    IOWA TAX BENEFITS.  The bill provides several tax benefits
 14  7 under the trust.  First, the value of any interest in the
 14  8 trust or other contracted state's qualified ABLE program
 14  9 of a decedent who was an Iowa resident dying on or after
 14 10 January 1, 2016, is excluded from the Iowa inheritance tax.
 14 11 Second, contributions to the trust or other contracted state's
 14 12 qualified ABLE program made on or after January 1, 2016, on
 14 13 behalf of a designated beneficiary who is an Iowa resident
 14 14 are deductible from the Iowa individual income tax up to the
 14 15 maximum amount allowed per beneficiary per year for purposes
 14 16 of the Iowa educational savings plan trust in Code chapter
 14 17 12D.  For 2015, that amount is set at $3,163.  Any amounts
 14 18 refunded to a taxpayer from the cancellation of a participation
 14 19 agreement or that are withdrawn for purposes other than the
 14 20 payment of qualified disability expenses of the designated
 14 21 beneficiary must be included in Iowa net income to the extent
 14 22 they were previously deducted by the taxpayer or any other
 14 23 person as a contribution.  Third, income and earnings from the
 14 24 trust or received by resident account owners from a contracted
 14 25 state's qualified ABLE program are exempt from the Iowa
 14 26 individual income tax.  The individual income tax benefits
 14 27 apply to tax years beginning on or after January 1, 2016.

 12  8 ABLE savings plan trust (trust) under the treasurer of state
 12  9 (state treasurer) that will meet the requirements of {529A of

 12 11 treasurer is the trustee of the trust and has numerous powers,

 12 13 purpose of the trust.
 12 14    The trust is authorized to enter into participation
 12 15 agreements with individuals for the payment of future qualified
 12 16 disability expenses, and to enter into contracts with other
 12 17 states (contracting state) to allow these states' residents
 12 18 access to the Iowa ABLE program.  "Qualified disability
 12 19 expenses" means the same as defined under the federal ABLE
 12 20 program, which generally defines the term to include expenses
 12 21 related to a designated beneficiary's education, housing,
 12 22 transportation, employment training and support, assistive

 12 27 of the United States treasury (secretary).
 12 28    Unless otherwise allowed under the federal ABLE program,
 12 29 the person with whom the state treasurer enters into a
 12 30 participation agreement must be both the account owner and
 12 31 designated beneficiary.  However, the bill allows a trustee
 12 32 or legal guardian to be designated as custodian of an account
 12 33 for a designated beneficiary who is a minor or who lacks
 12 34 capacity to enter into a participation agreement, provided such
 12 35 designation would be allowed under the federal ABLE program.
 13  1 "Designated beneficiary" is defined in the bill as a person who
 13  2 is a resident of Iowa or a contracting state and who qualifies
 13  3 as an eligible individual under the federal ABLE program, which
 13  4 includes individuals who are entitled to benefits based on
 13  5 blindness or disability under Title II (disability insurance)
 13  6 or Title XVI (supplemental security income) of the federal
 13  7 Social Security Act if such blindness or disability occurred
 13  8 before attaining 26 years of age, and if such individual files
 13  9 a disability certification with the secretary.
 13 10    The bill requires the state treasurer to maintain a separate
 13 11 account in the trust for each designated beneficiary of a
 13 12 participation agreement.  Unless otherwise allowed under the
 13 13 federal ABLE program, only one participation agreement shall be
 13 14 allowed per designated beneficiary.  Any person is allowed to
 13 15 make contributions in the form of cash to an account on behalf
 13 16 of a designated beneficiary.  The trust is required to maintain
 13 17 limits on the annual contributions to an account, and the
 13 18 aggregate balance in an account, matching those set forth in
 13 19 the federal ABLE program, which prohibits annual contributions
 13 20 to an account from exceeding the annual gift tax exclusion
 13 21 amount ($14,000 for 2015), and prohibits an aggregate account
 13 22 balance from exceeding the limit set by a state under its
 13 23 qualified tuition program (currently $320,000 for Iowa).
 13 24    The bill also permits the treasurer of state to defer
 13 25 implementation of the Iowa ABLE program and alternatively enter
 13 26 into an agreement with another state's qualified ABLE program
 13 27 to provide Iowa residents access to that state's program, if

 13 32 and ownership rights in the trust.  The bill provides that an
 13 33 account may be claimed by the Iowa Medicaid program upon the
 13 34 death of the designated beneficiary, in accordance with the
 13 35 federal ABLE program.  The bill requires the state treasurer to
 14  1 prepare and submit audited financial reports to the governor
 14  2 and general assembly, and further requires the state treasurer
 14  3 to comply with any reporting requirements of the federal ABLE

 12 12 as specified in the bill, for the purpose of carrying out the
 12 13 purpose of the trust.
 12 14    The trust is authorized to enter into participation
 12 15 agreements with individuals for the payment of future qualified
 12 16 disability expenses, and to enter into contracts with other
 12 17 states (contracting state) to allow these states' residents
 12 18 access to the Iowa ABLE program.  "Qualified disability
 12 19 expenses" means the same as defined under the federal ABLE
 12 20 program, which generally defines the term to include expenses
 12 21 related to a designated beneficiary's education, housing,
 12 22 transportation, employment training and support, assistive
 12 23 technology and personal support services, health, prevention
 12 24 and wellness, financial management and administrative services,
 12 25 legal fees, expenses for oversight and monitoring, funeral and
 12 26 burial expenses, and other expenses approved by the secretary
 12 27 of the United States treasury (secretary).
 12 28    Unless otherwise allowed under the federal ABLE program,
 12 29 the person with whom the state treasurer enters into a
 12 30 participation agreement must be both the account owner and
 12 31 designated beneficiary.  However, the bill allows a trustee
 12 32 or legal guardian to be designated as custodian of an account
 12 33 for a designated beneficiary who is a minor or who lacks
 12 34 capacity to enter into a participation agreement, provided such
 12 35 designation would be allowed under the federal ABLE program.
 13  1 "Designated beneficiary" is defined in the bill as a person who
 13  2 is a resident of Iowa or a contracting state and who qualifies
 13  3 as an eligible individual under the federal ABLE program, which
 13  4 includes individuals who are entitled to benefits based on
 13  5 blindness or disability under Title II (disability insurance)
 13  6 or Title XVI (supplemental security income) of the federal
 13  7 Social Security Act if such blindness or disability occurred
 13  8 before attaining 26 years of age, and if such individual files
 13  9 a disability certification with the secretary.
 13 10    The bill requires the state treasurer to maintain a separate
 13 11 account in the trust for each designated beneficiary of a
 13 12 participation agreement.  Unless otherwise allowed under the
 13 13 federal ABLE program, only one participation agreement shall be
 13 14 allowed per designated beneficiary.  Any person is allowed to
 13 15 make contributions in the form of cash to an account on behalf
 13 16 of a designated beneficiary.  The trust is required to maintain
 13 17 limits on the annual contributions to an account, and the
 13 18 aggregate balance in an account, matching those set forth in
 13 19 the federal ABLE program, which prohibits annual contributions
 13 20 to an account from exceeding the annual gift tax exclusion
 13 21 amount ($14,000 for 2015), and prohibits an aggregate account
 13 22 balance from exceeding the limit set by a state under its
 13 23 qualified tuition program (currently $320,000 for Iowa).
 13 24    The bill also permits the treasurer of state to defer
 13 25 implementation of the Iowa ABLE program and alternatively enter
 13 26 into an agreement with another state's qualified ABLE program
 13 27 to provide Iowa residents access to that state's program, if
 13 28 certain requirements specified in the bill are satisfied.
 13 29    The bill provides other various terms and conditions for
 13 30 participation agreements, use and segregation of trust funds,
 13 31 cancellation of agreements and refund of account balances,
 13 32 and ownership rights in the trust.  The bill provides that an
 13 33 account may be claimed by the Iowa Medicaid program upon the
 13 34 death of the designated beneficiary, in accordance with the
 13 35 federal ABLE program.  The bill requires the state treasurer to
 14  1 prepare and submit audited financial reports to the governor
 14  2 and general assembly, and further requires the state treasurer
 14  3 to comply with any reporting requirements of the federal ABLE
 14  4 program. The bill applies to qualified disability expenses
 14  5 incurred on or after July 1, 2015.
 14  6    IOWA TAX BENEFITS.  The bill provides several tax benefits
 14  7 under the trust.  First, the value of any interest in the
 14  8 trust or other contracted state's qualified ABLE program
 14  9 of a decedent who was an Iowa resident dying on or after
 14 10 January 1, 2016, is excluded from the Iowa inheritance tax.
 14 11 Second, contributions to the trust or other contracted state's
 14 12 qualified ABLE program made on or after January 1, 2016, on
 14 13 behalf of a designated beneficiary who is an Iowa resident
 14 14 are deductible from the Iowa individual income tax up to the
 14 15 maximum amount allowed per beneficiary per year for purposes
 14 16 of the Iowa educational savings plan trust in Code chapter
 14 17 12D.  For 2015, that amount is set at $3,163.  Any amounts
 14 18 refunded to a taxpayer from the cancellation of a participation
 14 19 agreement or that are withdrawn for purposes other than the
 14 20 payment of qualified disability expenses of the designated
 14 21 beneficiary must be included in Iowa net income to the extent
 14 22 they were previously deducted by the taxpayer or any other
 14 23 person as a contribution.  Third, income and earnings from the
 14 24 trust or received by resident account owners from a contracted
 14 25 state's qualified ABLE program are exempt from the Iowa
 14 26 individual income tax.  The individual income tax benefits
 14 27 apply to tax years beginning on or after January 1, 2016.
 14 28    CONTINGENT IMPLEMENTATION.  The implementation of the bill
 14 29 is subject to an appropriation with the purpose of the trust
 14 30 stated.

 11 24 Experience) savings plan trust and provides for various Iowa
 11 25 individual income tax and inheritance tax benefits.
 11 26    BACKGROUND.  On December 19, 2014, the federal Achieving
 11 27 A Better Life Experience Act of 2014 (ABLE Act) was enacted
 11 28 as part of the federal Tax Increase Prevention Act of 2014
 11 29 (Pub. L. No. 113=295).  The ABLE Act allows states to create
 11 30 programs to assist individuals in saving private funds for

 11 32 Qualifying state programs will allow for the establishment
 11 33 of accounts into which eligible disabled individuals or
 11 34 others may make contributions for the payment of future
 11 35 disability=related expenses of the eligible disabled
 12  1 individual.  Funds and earnings in accounts established
 12  2 under qualifying state programs are afforded federal benefits
 12  3 in certain circumstances, including federal tax exemption,
 12  4 bankruptcy protection, and exclusion from consideration under
 12  5 certain means=tested programs, such as Medicaid or supplemental
 12  6 security income.
 12  7    IOWA ABLE SAVINGS PLAN TRUST.  The bill creates the Iowa
 12  8 ABLE savings plan trust (trust) under the treasurer of state
 12  9 (state treasurer) that will meet the requirements of {529A of
 12 10 the Internal Revenue Code (federal ABLE program).  The state
 12 11 treasurer is the trustee of the trust and has numerous powers,
 12 12 as specified in the bill, for the purpose of carrying out the
 12 13 purpose of the trust.
 12 14    The trust is authorized to enter into participation
 12 15 agreements with individuals for the payment of future qualified
 12 16 disability expenses, and to enter into contracts with other
 12 17 states (contracting state) to allow these states' residents
 12 18 access to the Iowa ABLE program.  "Qualified disability
 12 19 expenses" means the same as defined under the federal ABLE
 12 20 program, which generally defines the term to include expenses
 12 21 related to a designated beneficiary's education, housing,
 12 22 transportation, employment training and support, assistive

 12 32 or legal guardian to be designated as custodian of an account
 12 33 for a designated beneficiary who is a minor or who lacks

 13  6 or Title XVI (supplemental security income) of the federal
 13  7 Social Security Act if such blindness or disability occurred
 13  8 before attaining 26 years of age, and if such individual files
 13  9 a disability certification with the secretary.
 13 10    The bill requires the state treasurer to maintain a separate
 13 11 account in the trust for each designated beneficiary of a
 13 12 participation agreement.  Unless otherwise allowed under the
 13 13 federal ABLE program, only one participation agreement shall be
 13 14 allowed per designated beneficiary.  Any person is allowed to
 13 15 make contributions in the form of cash to an account on behalf
 13 16 of a designated beneficiary.  The trust is required to maintain
 13 17 limits on the annual contributions to an account, and the
 13 18 aggregate balance in an account, matching those set forth in

 13 22 balance from exceeding the limit set by a state under its
 13 23 qualified tuition program (currently $320,000 for Iowa).
 13 24    The bill also permits the treasurer of state to defer
 13 25 implementation of the Iowa ABLE program and alternatively enter
 13 26 into an agreement with another state's qualified ABLE program
 13 27 to provide Iowa residents access to that state's program, if
 13 28 certain requirements specified in the bill are satisfied.
 13 29    The bill provides other various terms and conditions for

 14 19 agreement or that are withdrawn for purposes other than the
 14 20 payment of qualified disability expenses of the designated

 11 23    This bill creates an Iowa ABLE (Achieving A Better Life
 11 24 Experience) savings plan trust and provides for various Iowa
 11 25 individual income tax and inheritance tax benefits.
 11 26    BACKGROUND.  On December 19, 2014, the federal Achieving
 11 27 A Better Life Experience Act of 2014 (ABLE Act) was enacted
 11 28 as part of the federal Tax Increase Prevention Act of 2014
 11 29 (Pub. L. No. 113=295).  The ABLE Act allows states to create
 11 30 programs to assist individuals in saving private funds for
 11 31 the purpose of supporting individuals with disabilities.
 11 32 Qualifying state programs will allow for the establishment
 11 33 of accounts into which eligible disabled individuals or
 11 34 others may make contributions for the payment of future
 11 35 disability=related expenses of the eligible disabled
 12  1 individual.  Funds and earnings in accounts established
 12  2 under qualifying state programs are afforded federal benefits
 12  3 in certain circumstances, including federal tax exemption,
 12  4 bankruptcy protection, and exclusion from consideration under
 12  5 certain means=tested programs, such as Medicaid or supplemental
 12  6 security income.
 12  7    IOWA ABLE SAVINGS PLAN TRUST.  The bill creates the Iowa
 12  8 ABLE savings plan trust (trust) under the treasurer of state
 12  9 (state treasurer) that will meet the requirements of {529A of
 12 10 the Internal Revenue Code (federal ABLE program).  The state
 12 11 treasurer is the trustee of the trust and has numerous powers,
 12 12 as specified in the bill, for the purpose of carrying out the
 12 13 purpose of the trust.
 12 14    The trust is authorized to enter into participation
 12 15 agreements with individuals for the payment of future qualified
 12 16 disability expenses, and to enter into contracts with other
 12 17 states (contracting state) to allow these states' residents
 12 18 access to the Iowa ABLE program.  "Qualified disability
 12 19 expenses" means the same as defined under the federal ABLE
 12 20 program, which generally defines the term to include expenses
 12 21 related to a designated beneficiary's education, housing,
 12 22 transportation, employment training and support, assistive
 12 23 technology and personal support services, health, prevention
 12 24 and wellness, financial management and administrative services,
 12 25 legal fees, expenses for oversight and monitoring, funeral and
 12 26 burial expenses, and other expenses approved by the secretary
 12 27 of the United States treasury (secretary).
 12 28    Unless otherwise allowed under the federal ABLE program,
 12 29 the person with whom the state treasurer enters into a
 12 30 participation agreement must be both the account owner and
 12 31 designated beneficiary.  However, the bill allows a trustee
 12 32 or legal guardian to be designated as custodian of an account
 12 33 for a designated beneficiary who is a minor or who lacks
 12 34 capacity to enter into a participation agreement, provided such
 12 35 designation would be allowed under the federal ABLE program.
 13  1 "Designated beneficiary" is defined in the bill as a person who
 13  2 is a resident of Iowa or a contracting state and who qualifies
 13  3 as an eligible individual under the federal ABLE program, which
 13  4 includes individuals who are entitled to benefits based on
 13  5 blindness or disability under Title II (disability insurance)
 13  6 or Title XVI (supplemental security income) of the federal
 13  7 Social Security Act if such blindness or disability occurred
 13  8 before attaining 26 years of age, and if such individual files
 13  9 a disability certification with the secretary.
 13 10    The bill requires the state treasurer to maintain a separate
 13 11 account in the trust for each designated beneficiary of a
 13 12 participation agreement.  Unless otherwise allowed under the
 13 13 federal ABLE program, only one participation agreement shall be
 13 14 allowed per designated beneficiary.  Any person is allowed to
 13 15 make contributions in the form of cash to an account on behalf
 13 16 of a designated beneficiary.  The trust is required to maintain
 13 17 limits on the annual contributions to an account, and the
 13 18 aggregate balance in an account, matching those set forth in
 13 19 the federal ABLE program, which prohibits annual contributions
 13 20 to an account from exceeding the annual gift tax exclusion
 13 21 amount ($14,000 for 2015), and prohibits an aggregate account
 13 22 balance from exceeding the limit set by a state under its
 13 23 qualified tuition program (currently $320,000 for Iowa).
 13 24    The bill also permits the treasurer of state to defer
 13 25 implementation of the Iowa ABLE program and alternatively enter
 13 26 into an agreement with another state's qualified ABLE program
 13 27 to provide Iowa residents access to that state's program, if
 13 28 certain requirements specified in the bill are satisfied.
 13 29    The bill provides other various terms and conditions for
 13 30 participation agreements, use and segregation of trust funds,
 13 31 cancellation of agreements and refund of account balances,
 13 32 and ownership rights in the trust.  The bill provides that an
 13 33 account may be claimed by the Iowa Medicaid program upon the
 13 34 death of the designated beneficiary, in accordance with the
 13 35 federal ABLE program.  The bill requires the state treasurer to
 14  1 prepare and submit audited financial reports to the governor
 14  2 and general assembly, and further requires the state treasurer
 14  3 to comply with any reporting requirements of the federal ABLE
 14  4 program. The bill applies to qualified disability expenses
 14  5 incurred on or after July 1, 2015.
 14  6    IOWA TAX BENEFITS.  The bill provides several tax benefits
 14  7 under the trust.  First, the value of any interest in the
 14  8 trust or other contracted state's qualified ABLE program
 14  9 of a decedent who was an Iowa resident dying on or after
 14 10 January 1, 2016, is excluded from the Iowa inheritance tax.
 14 11 Second, contributions to the trust or other contracted state's
 14 12 qualified ABLE program made on or after January 1, 2016, on
 14 13 behalf of a designated beneficiary who is an Iowa resident
 14 14 are deductible from the Iowa individual income tax up to the
 14 15 maximum amount allowed per beneficiary per year for purposes
 14 16 of the Iowa educational savings plan trust in Code chapter
 14 17 12D.  For 2015, that amount is set at $3,163.  Any amounts
 14 18 refunded to a taxpayer from the cancellation of a participation
 14 19 agreement or that are withdrawn for purposes other than the
 14 20 payment of qualified disability expenses of the designated
 14 21 beneficiary must be included in Iowa net income to the extent
 14 22 they were previously deducted by the taxpayer or any other

 13 15 make contributions in the form of cash to an account on behalf
 13 16 of a designated beneficiary.  The trust is required to maintain
 13 17 limits on the annual contributions to an account, and the

 14  2 and general assembly, and further requires the state treasurer
 14  3 to comply with any reporting requirements of the federal ABLE
 14  4 program. The bill applies to qualified disability expenses

 14 15 maximum amount allowed per beneficiary per year for purposes
 14 16 of the Iowa educational savings plan trust in Code chapter

 14 19 agreement or that are withdrawn for purposes other than the
 14 20 payment of qualified disability expenses of the designated

 11 27 A Better Life Experience Act of 2014 (ABLE Act) was enacted
 11 28 as part of the federal Tax Increase Prevention Act of 2014
 11 29 (Pub. L. No. 113=295).  The ABLE Act allows states to create
 11 30 programs to assist individuals in saving private funds for
 11 31 the purpose of supporting individuals with disabilities.
 11 32 Qualifying state programs will allow for the establishment
 11 33 of accounts into which eligible disabled individuals or
 11 34 others may make contributions for the payment of future
 11 35 disability=related expenses of the eligible disabled
 12  1 individual.  Funds and earnings in accounts established

 12  4 bankruptcy protection, and exclusion from consideration under
 12  5 certain means=tested programs, such as Medicaid or supplemental

 12  8 ABLE savings plan trust (trust) under the treasurer of state
 12  9 (state treasurer) that will meet the requirements of {529A of
 12 10 the Internal Revenue Code (federal ABLE program).  The state
 12 11 treasurer is the trustee of the trust and has numerous powers,
 12 12 as specified in the bill, for the purpose of carrying out the
 12 13 purpose of the trust.
 12 14    The trust is authorized to enter into participation
 12 15 agreements with individuals for the payment of future qualified
 12 16 disability expenses, and to enter into contracts with other
 12 17 states (contracting state) to allow these states' residents
 12 18 access to the Iowa ABLE program.  "Qualified disability
 12 19 expenses" means the same as defined under the federal ABLE
 12 20 program, which generally defines the term to include expenses
 12 21 related to a designated beneficiary's education, housing,
 12 22 transportation, employment training and support, assistive

 12 32 or legal guardian to be designated as custodian of an account
 12 33 for a designated beneficiary who is a minor or who lacks
 12 34 capacity to enter into a participation agreement, provided such

 13  1 "Designated beneficiary" is defined in the bill as a person who
 13  2 is a resident of Iowa or a contracting state and who qualifies
 13  3 as an eligible individual under the federal ABLE program, which

 13  5 blindness or disability under Title II (disability insurance)
 13  6 or Title XVI (supplemental security income) of the federal
 13  7 Social Security Act if such blindness or disability occurred
 13  8 before attaining 26 years of age, and if such individual files
 13  9 a disability certification with the secretary.
 13 10    The bill requires the state treasurer to maintain a separate
 13 11 account in the trust for each designated beneficiary of a
 13 12 participation agreement.  Unless otherwise allowed under the
 13 13 federal ABLE program, only one participation agreement shall be
 13 14 allowed per designated beneficiary.  Any person is allowed to
 13 15 make contributions in the form of cash to an account on behalf
 13 16 of a designated beneficiary.  The trust is required to maintain
 13 17 limits on the annual contributions to an account, and the
 13 18 aggregate balance in an account, matching those set forth in

 13  6 or Title XVI (supplemental security income) of the federal
 13  7 Social Security Act if such blindness or disability occurred
 13  8 before attaining 26 years of age, and if such individual files
 13  9 a disability certification with the secretary.
 13 10    The bill requires the state treasurer to maintain a separate
 13 11 account in the trust for each designated beneficiary of a
 13 12 participation agreement.  Unless otherwise allowed under the
 13 13 federal ABLE program, only one participation agreement shall be
 13 14 allowed per designated beneficiary.  Any person is allowed to
 13 15 make contributions in the form of cash to an account on behalf
 13 16 of a designated beneficiary.  The trust is required to maintain
 13 17 limits on the annual contributions to an account, and the
 13 18 aggregate balance in an account, matching those set forth in
 13 19 the federal ABLE program, which prohibits annual contributions
 13 20 to an account from exceeding the annual gift tax exclusion
 13 21 amount ($14,000 for 2015), and prohibits an aggregate account
 13 22 balance from exceeding the limit set by a state under its
 13 23 qualified tuition program (currently $320,000 for Iowa).
 13 24    The bill also permits the treasurer of state to defer
 13 25 implementation of the Iowa ABLE program and alternatively enter
 13 26 into an agreement with another state's qualified ABLE program
 13 27 to provide Iowa residents access to that state's program, if
 13 28 certain requirements specified in the bill are satisfied.
 13 29    The bill provides other various terms and conditions for
 13 30 participation agreements, use and segregation of trust funds,
 13 31 cancellation of agreements and refund of account balances,
 13 32 and ownership rights in the trust.  The bill provides that an
 13 33 account may be claimed by the Iowa Medicaid program upon the
 13 34 death of the designated beneficiary, in accordance with the
 13 35 federal ABLE program.  The bill requires the state treasurer to
 14  1 prepare and submit audited financial reports to the governor
 14  2 and general assembly, and further requires the state treasurer
 14  3 to comply with any reporting requirements of the federal ABLE
 14  4 program. The bill applies to qualified disability expenses
 14  5 incurred on or after July 1, 2015.
 14  6    IOWA TAX BENEFITS.  The bill provides several tax benefits
 14  7 under the trust.  First, the value of any interest in the
 14  8 trust or other contracted state's qualified ABLE program
 14  9 of a decedent who was an Iowa resident dying on or after
 14 10 January 1, 2016, is excluded from the Iowa inheritance tax.

 14 15 maximum amount allowed per beneficiary per year for purposes
 14 16 of the Iowa educational savings plan trust in Code chapter
 14 17 12D.  For 2015, that amount is set at $3,163.  Any amounts
 14 18 refunded to a taxpayer from the cancellation of a participation
 14 19 agreement or that are withdrawn for purposes other than the
 14 20 payment of qualified disability expenses of the designated
 14 21 beneficiary must be included in Iowa net income to the extent
 14 22 they were previously deducted by the taxpayer or any other
 14 23 person as a contribution.  Third, income and earnings from the
 14 24 trust or received by resident account owners from a contracted
 14 25 state's qualified ABLE program are exempt from the Iowa

 12  8 ABLE savings plan trust (trust) under the treasurer of state
 12  9 (state treasurer) that will meet the requirements of {529A of
 12 10 the Internal Revenue Code (federal ABLE program).  The state
 12 11 treasurer is the trustee of the trust and has numerous powers,
 12 12 as specified in the bill, for the purpose of carrying out the
 12 13 purpose of the trust.
 12 14    The trust is authorized to enter into participation
 12 15 agreements with individuals for the payment of future qualified
 12 16 disability expenses, and to enter into contracts with other
 12 17 states (contracting state) to allow these states' residents
 12 18 access to the Iowa ABLE program.  "Qualified disability
 12 19 expenses" means the same as defined under the federal ABLE
 12 20 program, which generally defines the term to include expenses
 12 21 related to a designated beneficiary's education, housing,
 12 22 transportation, employment training and support, assistive
 12 23 technology and personal support services, health, prevention
 12 24 and wellness, financial management and administrative services,
 12 25 legal fees, expenses for oversight and monitoring, funeral and

 12 32 or legal guardian to be designated as custodian of an account
 12 33 for a designated beneficiary who is a minor or who lacks
 12 34 capacity to enter into a participation agreement, provided such

 13  5 blindness or disability under Title II (disability insurance)
 13  6 or Title XVI (supplemental security income) of the federal
 13  7 Social Security Act if such blindness or disability occurred

 13  9 a disability certification with the secretary.
 13 10    The bill requires the state treasurer to maintain a separate
 13 11 account in the trust for each designated beneficiary of a
 13 12 participation agreement.  Unless otherwise allowed under the
 13 13 federal ABLE program, only one participation agreement shall be
 13 14 allowed per designated beneficiary.  Any person is allowed to
 13 15 make contributions in the form of cash to an account on behalf
 13 16 of a designated beneficiary.  The trust is required to maintain
 13 17 limits on the annual contributions to an account, and the
 13 18 aggregate balance in an account, matching those set forth in
 13 19 the federal ABLE program, which prohibits annual contributions
 13 20 to an account from exceeding the annual gift tax exclusion
 13 21 amount ($14,000 for 2015), and prohibits an aggregate account
 13 22 balance from exceeding the limit set by a state under its
 13 23 qualified tuition program (currently $320,000 for Iowa).

 12  8 ABLE savings plan trust (trust) under the treasurer of state
 12  9 (state treasurer) that will meet the requirements of {529A of
 12 10 the Internal Revenue Code (federal ABLE program).  The state
 12 11 treasurer is the trustee of the trust and has numerous powers,
 12 12 as specified in the bill, for the purpose of carrying out the
 12 13 purpose of the trust.
 12 14    The trust is authorized to enter into participation
 12 15 agreements with individuals for the payment of future qualified
 12 16 disability expenses, and to enter into contracts with other
 12 17 states (contracting state) to allow these states' residents
 12 18 access to the Iowa ABLE program.  "Qualified disability
 12 19 expenses" means the same as defined under the federal ABLE
 12 20 program, which generally defines the term to include expenses
 12 21 related to a designated beneficiary's education, housing,
 12 22 transportation, employment training and support, assistive
 12 23 technology and personal support services, health, prevention
 12 24 and wellness, financial management and administrative services,
 12 25 legal fees, expenses for oversight and monitoring, funeral and
 12 26 burial expenses, and other expenses approved by the secretary
 12 27 of the United States treasury (secretary).
 12 28    Unless otherwise allowed under the federal ABLE program,
 12 29 the person with whom the state treasurer enters into a
 12 30 participation agreement must be both the account owner and
 12 31 designated beneficiary.  However, the bill allows a trustee
 12 32 or legal guardian to be designated as custodian of an account
 12 33 for a designated beneficiary who is a minor or who lacks
 12 34 capacity to enter into a participation agreement, provided such
 12 35 designation would be allowed under the federal ABLE program.
 13  1 "Designated beneficiary" is defined in the bill as a person who
 13  2 is a resident of Iowa or a contracting state and who qualifies
 13  3 as an eligible individual under the federal ABLE program, which
 13  4 includes individuals who are entitled to benefits based on
 13  5 blindness or disability under Title II (disability insurance)
 13  6 or Title XVI (supplemental security income) of the federal
 13  7 Social Security Act if such blindness or disability occurred
 13  8 before attaining 26 years of age, and if such individual files
 13  9 a disability certification with the secretary.
 13 10    The bill requires the state treasurer to maintain a separate
 13 11 account in the trust for each designated beneficiary of a
 13 12 participation agreement.  Unless otherwise allowed under the
 13 13 federal ABLE program, only one participation agreement shall be
 13 14 allowed per designated beneficiary.  Any person is allowed to
 13 15 make contributions in the form of cash to an account on behalf
 13 16 of a designated beneficiary.  The trust is required to maintain
 13 17 limits on the annual contributions to an account, and the
 13 18 aggregate balance in an account, matching those set forth in
 13 19 the federal ABLE program, which prohibits annual contributions
 13 20 to an account from exceeding the annual gift tax exclusion
 13 21 amount ($14,000 for 2015), and prohibits an aggregate account
 13 22 balance from exceeding the limit set by a state under its
 13 23 qualified tuition program (currently $320,000 for Iowa).
 13 24    The bill also permits the treasurer of state to defer
 13 25 implementation of the Iowa ABLE program and alternatively enter
 13 26 into an agreement with another state's qualified ABLE program
 13 27 to provide Iowa residents access to that state's program, if
 13 28 certain requirements specified in the bill are satisfied.
 13 29    The bill provides other various terms and conditions for
 13 30 participation agreements, use and segregation of trust funds,
 13 31 cancellation of agreements and refund of account balances,
 13 32 and ownership rights in the trust.  The bill provides that an
 13 33 account may be claimed by the Iowa Medicaid program upon the
 13 34 death of the designated beneficiary, in accordance with the
 13 35 federal ABLE program.  The bill requires the state treasurer to
 14  1 prepare and submit audited financial reports to the governor
 14  2 and general assembly, and further requires the state treasurer
 14  3 to comply with any reporting requirements of the federal ABLE
 14  4 program. The bill applies to qualified disability expenses
 14  5 incurred on or after July 1, 2015.
 14  6    IOWA TAX BENEFITS.  The bill provides several tax benefits
 14  7 under the trust.  First, the value of any interest in the
 14  8 trust or other contracted state's qualified ABLE program
 14  9 of a decedent who was an Iowa resident dying on or after
 14 10 January 1, 2016, is excluded from the Iowa inheritance tax.
 14 11 Second, contributions to the trust or other contracted state's
 14 12 qualified ABLE program made on or after January 1, 2016, on
 14 13 behalf of a designated beneficiary who is an Iowa resident
 14 14 are deductible from the Iowa individual income tax up to the
 14 15 maximum amount allowed per beneficiary per year for purposes
 14 16 of the Iowa educational savings plan trust in Code chapter
 14 17 12D.  For 2015, that amount is set at $3,163.  Any amounts
 14 18 refunded to a taxpayer from the cancellation of a participation
 14 19 agreement or that are withdrawn for purposes other than the
 14 20 payment of qualified disability expenses of the designated
 14 21 beneficiary must be included in Iowa net income to the extent

 13 12 participation agreement.  Unless otherwise allowed under the
 13 13 federal ABLE program, only one participation agreement shall be
 13 14 allowed per designated beneficiary.  Any person is allowed to
 13 15 make contributions in the form of cash to an account on behalf
 13 16 of a designated beneficiary.  The trust is required to maintain
 13 17 limits on the annual contributions to an account, and the
 13 18 aggregate balance in an account, matching those set forth in
 13 19 the federal ABLE program, which prohibits annual contributions
 13 20 to an account from exceeding the annual gift tax exclusion
 13 21 amount ($14,000 for 2015), and prohibits an aggregate account
 13 22 balance from exceeding the limit set by a state under its
 13 23 qualified tuition program (currently $320,000 for Iowa).
 13 24    The bill also permits the treasurer of state to defer
 13 25 implementation of the Iowa ABLE program and alternatively enter
 13 26 into an agreement with another state's qualified ABLE program
 13 27 to provide Iowa residents access to that state's program, if
 13 28 certain requirements specified in the bill are satisfied.
 13 29    The bill provides other various terms and conditions for
 13 30 participation agreements, use and segregation of trust funds,
 13 31 cancellation of agreements and refund of account balances,
 13 32 and ownership rights in the trust.  The bill provides that an
 13 33 account may be claimed by the Iowa Medicaid program upon the
 13 34 death of the designated beneficiary, in accordance with the
 13 35 federal ABLE program.  The bill requires the state treasurer to
 14  1 prepare and submit audited financial reports to the governor
 14  2 and general assembly, and further requires the state treasurer
 14  3 to comply with any reporting requirements of the federal ABLE
 14  4 program. The bill applies to qualified disability expenses
 14  5 incurred on or after July 1, 2015.
 14  6    IOWA TAX BENEFITS.  The bill provides several tax benefits
 14  7 under the trust.  First, the value of any interest in the
 14  8 trust or other contracted state's qualified ABLE program
 14  9 of a decedent who was an Iowa resident dying on or after
 14 10 January 1, 2016, is excluded from the Iowa inheritance tax.
 14 11 Second, contributions to the trust or other contracted state's
 14 12 qualified ABLE program made on or after January 1, 2016, on
 14 13 behalf of a designated beneficiary who is an Iowa resident
 14 14 are deductible from the Iowa individual income tax up to the
 14 15 maximum amount allowed per beneficiary per year for purposes
 14 16 of the Iowa educational savings plan trust in Code chapter
 14 17 12D.  For 2015, that amount is set at $3,163.  Any amounts
 14 18 refunded to a taxpayer from the cancellation of a participation
 14 19 agreement or that are withdrawn for purposes other than the
 14 20 payment of qualified disability expenses of the designated
 14 21 beneficiary must be included in Iowa net income to the extent
 14 22 they were previously deducted by the taxpayer or any other
 14 23 person as a contribution.  Third, income and earnings from the
 14 24 trust or received by resident account owners from a contracted
 14 25 state's qualified ABLE program are exempt from the Iowa
 14 26 individual income tax.  The individual income tax benefits
 14 27 apply to tax years beginning on or after January 1, 2016.

 12 17 states (contracting state) to allow these states' residents
 12 18 access to the Iowa ABLE program.  "Qualified disability

 12 32 or legal guardian to be designated as custodian of an account
 12 33 for a designated beneficiary who is a minor or who lacks
 12 34 capacity to enter into a participation agreement, provided such

 13  1 "Designated beneficiary" is defined in the bill as a person who
 13  2 is a resident of Iowa or a contracting state and who qualifies
 13  3 as an eligible individual under the federal ABLE program, which

 12 28    Unless otherwise allowed under the federal ABLE program,
 12 29 the person with whom the state treasurer enters into a
 12 30 participation agreement must be both the account owner and
 12 31 designated beneficiary.  However, the bill allows a trustee
 12 32 or legal guardian to be designated as custodian of an account
 12 33 for a designated beneficiary who is a minor or who lacks
 12 34 capacity to enter into a participation agreement, provided such
 12 35 designation would be allowed under the federal ABLE program.
 13  1 "Designated beneficiary" is defined in the bill as a person who
 13  2 is a resident of Iowa or a contracting state and who qualifies
 13  3 as an eligible individual under the federal ABLE program, which
 13  4 includes individuals who are entitled to benefits based on
 13  5 blindness or disability under Title II (disability insurance)
 13  6 or Title XVI (supplemental security income) of the federal
 13  7 Social Security Act if such blindness or disability occurred
 13  8 before attaining 26 years of age, and if such individual files
 13  9 a disability certification with the secretary.
 13 10    The bill requires the state treasurer to maintain a separate
 13 11 account in the trust for each designated beneficiary of a
 13 12 participation agreement.  Unless otherwise allowed under the
 13 13 federal ABLE program, only one participation agreement shall be
 13 14 allowed per designated beneficiary.  Any person is allowed to
 13 15 make contributions in the form of cash to an account on behalf
 13 16 of a designated beneficiary.  The trust is required to maintain
 13 17 limits on the annual contributions to an account, and the
 13 18 aggregate balance in an account, matching those set forth in
 13 19 the federal ABLE program, which prohibits annual contributions
 13 20 to an account from exceeding the annual gift tax exclusion
 13 21 amount ($14,000 for 2015), and prohibits an aggregate account
 13 22 balance from exceeding the limit set by a state under its
 13 23 qualified tuition program (currently $320,000 for Iowa).
 13 24    The bill also permits the treasurer of state to defer
 13 25 implementation of the Iowa ABLE program and alternatively enter
 13 26 into an agreement with another state's qualified ABLE program
 13 27 to provide Iowa residents access to that state's program, if
 13 28 certain requirements specified in the bill are satisfied.
 13 29    The bill provides other various terms and conditions for
 13 30 participation agreements, use and segregation of trust funds,
 13 31 cancellation of agreements and refund of account balances,
 13 32 and ownership rights in the trust.  The bill provides that an
 13 33 account may be claimed by the Iowa Medicaid program upon the
 13 34 death of the designated beneficiary, in accordance with the
 13 35 federal ABLE program.  The bill requires the state treasurer to
 14  1 prepare and submit audited financial reports to the governor
 14  2 and general assembly, and further requires the state treasurer
 14  3 to comply with any reporting requirements of the federal ABLE
 14  4 program. The bill applies to qualified disability expenses
 14  5 incurred on or after July 1, 2015.
 14  6    IOWA TAX BENEFITS.  The bill provides several tax benefits
 14  7 under the trust.  First, the value of any interest in the
 14  8 trust or other contracted state's qualified ABLE program
 14  9 of a decedent who was an Iowa resident dying on or after
 14 10 January 1, 2016, is excluded from the Iowa inheritance tax.
 14 11 Second, contributions to the trust or other contracted state's
 14 12 qualified ABLE program made on or after January 1, 2016, on
 14 13 behalf of a designated beneficiary who is an Iowa resident
 14 14 are deductible from the Iowa individual income tax up to the
 14 15 maximum amount allowed per beneficiary per year for purposes
 14 16 of the Iowa educational savings plan trust in Code chapter
 14 17 12D.  For 2015, that amount is set at $3,163.  Any amounts
 14 18 refunded to a taxpayer from the cancellation of a participation
 14 19 agreement or that are withdrawn for purposes other than the
 14 20 payment of qualified disability expenses of the designated
 14 21 beneficiary must be included in Iowa net income to the extent
 14 22 they were previously deducted by the taxpayer or any other
 14 23 person as a contribution.  Third, income and earnings from the
 14 24 trust or received by resident account owners from a contracted
 14 25 state's qualified ABLE program are exempt from the Iowa
 14 26 individual income tax.  The individual income tax benefits
 14 27 apply to tax years beginning on or after January 1, 2016.

 12 35 designation would be allowed under the federal ABLE program.
 13  1 "Designated beneficiary" is defined in the bill as a person who
 13  2 is a resident of Iowa or a contracting state and who qualifies
 13  3 as an eligible individual under the federal ABLE program, which
 13  4 includes individuals who are entitled to benefits based on
 13  5 blindness or disability under Title II (disability insurance)
 13  6 or Title XVI (supplemental security income) of the federal
 13  7 Social Security Act if such blindness or disability occurred
 13  8 before attaining 26 years of age, and if such individual files
 13  9 a disability certification with the secretary.
 13 10    The bill requires the state treasurer to maintain a separate
 13 11 account in the trust for each designated beneficiary of a
 13 12 participation agreement.  Unless otherwise allowed under the
 13 13 federal ABLE program, only one participation agreement shall be
 13 14 allowed per designated beneficiary.  Any person is allowed to
 13 15 make contributions in the form of cash to an account on behalf
 13 16 of a designated beneficiary.  The trust is required to maintain
 13 17 limits on the annual contributions to an account, and the
 13 18 aggregate balance in an account, matching those set forth in
 13 19 the federal ABLE program, which prohibits annual contributions
 13 20 to an account from exceeding the annual gift tax exclusion
 13 21 amount ($14,000 for 2015), and prohibits an aggregate account
 13 22 balance from exceeding the limit set by a state under its
 13 23 qualified tuition program (currently $320,000 for Iowa).
 13 24    The bill also permits the treasurer of state to defer
 13 25 implementation of the Iowa ABLE program and alternatively enter
 13 26 into an agreement with another state's qualified ABLE program
 13 27 to provide Iowa residents access to that state's program, if
 13 28 certain requirements specified in the bill are satisfied.
 13 29    The bill provides other various terms and conditions for
 13 30 participation agreements, use and segregation of trust funds,
 13 31 cancellation of agreements and refund of account balances,
 13 32 and ownership rights in the trust.  The bill provides that an
 13 33 account may be claimed by the Iowa Medicaid program upon the
 13 34 death of the designated beneficiary, in accordance with the
 13 35 federal ABLE program.  The bill requires the state treasurer to
 14  1 prepare and submit audited financial reports to the governor
 14  2 and general assembly, and further requires the state treasurer
 14  3 to comply with any reporting requirements of the federal ABLE
 14  4 program. The bill applies to qualified disability expenses
 14  5 incurred on or after July 1, 2015.
 14  6    IOWA TAX BENEFITS.  The bill provides several tax benefits
 14  7 under the trust.  First, the value of any interest in the
 14  8 trust or other contracted state's qualified ABLE program
 14  9 of a decedent who was an Iowa resident dying on or after
 14 10 January 1, 2016, is excluded from the Iowa inheritance tax.
 14 11 Second, contributions to the trust or other contracted state's
 14 12 qualified ABLE program made on or after January 1, 2016, on
 14 13 behalf of a designated beneficiary who is an Iowa resident
 14 14 are deductible from the Iowa individual income tax up to the
 14 15 maximum amount allowed per beneficiary per year for purposes
 14 16 of the Iowa educational savings plan trust in Code chapter
 14 17 12D.  For 2015, that amount is set at $3,163.  Any amounts
 14 18 refunded to a taxpayer from the cancellation of a participation
 14 19 agreement or that are withdrawn for purposes other than the
 14 20 payment of qualified disability expenses of the designated
 14 21 beneficiary must be included in Iowa net income to the extent
 14 22 they were previously deducted by the taxpayer or any other
 14 23 person as a contribution.  Third, income and earnings from the
 14 24 trust or received by resident account owners from a contracted
 14 25 state's qualified ABLE program are exempt from the Iowa
 14 26 individual income tax.  The individual income tax benefits
 14 27 apply to tax years beginning on or after January 1, 2016.

 14 10 January 1, 2016, is excluded from the Iowa inheritance tax.
 14 11 Second, contributions to the trust or other contracted state's
 14 12 qualified ABLE program made on or after January 1, 2016, on
 14 13 behalf of a designated beneficiary who is an Iowa resident
 14 14 are deductible from the Iowa individual income tax up to the
 14 15 maximum amount allowed per beneficiary per year for purposes
 14 16 of the Iowa educational savings plan trust in Code chapter
 14 17 12D.  For 2015, that amount is set at $3,163.  Any amounts
 14 18 refunded to a taxpayer from the cancellation of a participation
 14 19 agreement or that are withdrawn for purposes other than the
 14 20 payment of qualified disability expenses of the designated
 14 21 beneficiary must be included in Iowa net income to the extent
 14 22 they were previously deducted by the taxpayer or any other
 14 23 person as a contribution.  Third, income and earnings from the
 14 24 trust or received by resident account owners from a contracted
 14 25 state's qualified ABLE program are exempt from the Iowa
 14 26 individual income tax.  The individual income tax benefits

 12 32 or legal guardian to be designated as custodian of an account
 12 33 for a designated beneficiary who is a minor or who lacks
 12 34 capacity to enter into a participation agreement, provided such

 13  5 blindness or disability under Title II (disability insurance)

 13 14 allowed per designated beneficiary.  Any person is allowed to
 13 15 make contributions in the form of cash to an account on behalf
 13 16 of a designated beneficiary.  The trust is required to maintain
 13 17 limits on the annual contributions to an account, and the
 13 18 aggregate balance in an account, matching those set forth in
 13 19 the federal ABLE program, which prohibits annual contributions
 13 20 to an account from exceeding the annual gift tax exclusion
 13 21 amount ($14,000 for 2015), and prohibits an aggregate account
 13 22 balance from exceeding the limit set by a state under its
 13 23 qualified tuition program (currently $320,000 for Iowa).

 13 11 account in the trust for each designated beneficiary of a
 13 12 participation agreement.  Unless otherwise allowed under the
 13 13 federal ABLE program, only one participation agreement shall be
 13 14 allowed per designated beneficiary.  Any person is allowed to
 13 15 make contributions in the form of cash to an account on behalf
 13 16 of a designated beneficiary.  The trust is required to maintain
 13 17 limits on the annual contributions to an account, and the
 13 18 aggregate balance in an account, matching those set forth in
 13 19 the federal ABLE program, which prohibits annual contributions
 13 20 to an account from exceeding the annual gift tax exclusion
 13 21 amount ($14,000 for 2015), and prohibits an aggregate account
 13 22 balance from exceeding the limit set by a state under its
 13 23 qualified tuition program (currently $320,000 for Iowa).
 13 24    The bill also permits the treasurer of state to defer
 13 25 implementation of the Iowa ABLE program and alternatively enter
 13 26 into an agreement with another state's qualified ABLE program
 13 27 to provide Iowa residents access to that state's program, if
 13 28 certain requirements specified in the bill are satisfied.
 13 29    The bill provides other various terms and conditions for
 13 30 participation agreements, use and segregation of trust funds,
 13 31 cancellation of agreements and refund of account balances,
 13 32 and ownership rights in the trust.  The bill provides that an
 13 33 account may be claimed by the Iowa Medicaid program upon the
 13 34 death of the designated beneficiary, in accordance with the
 13 35 federal ABLE program.  The bill requires the state treasurer to
 14  1 prepare and submit audited financial reports to the governor
 14  2 and general assembly, and further requires the state treasurer
 14  3 to comply with any reporting requirements of the federal ABLE
 14  4 program. The bill applies to qualified disability expenses
 14  5 incurred on or after July 1, 2015.
 14  6    IOWA TAX BENEFITS.  The bill provides several tax benefits
 14  7 under the trust.  First, the value of any interest in the

 14 10 January 1, 2016, is excluded from the Iowa inheritance tax.

 14 15 maximum amount allowed per beneficiary per year for purposes
 14 16 of the Iowa educational savings plan trust in Code chapter

 14 18 refunded to a taxpayer from the cancellation of a participation
 14 19 agreement or that are withdrawn for purposes other than the
 14 20 payment of qualified disability expenses of the designated
 14 21 beneficiary must be included in Iowa net income to the extent

 14 15 maximum amount allowed per beneficiary per year for purposes
 14 16 of the Iowa educational savings plan trust in Code chapter

 14 18 refunded to a taxpayer from the cancellation of a participation
 14 19 agreement or that are withdrawn for purposes other than the
 14 20 payment of qualified disability expenses of the designated
 14 21 beneficiary must be included in Iowa net income to the extent
