  9  2                           EXPLANATION
  9  3 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  9  4 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  9  5    This bill relates to the issuance and verification of, and
  9  6 the transfer of records concerning nonprofessional permits
  9  7 to carry weapons and the confidentiality of records for such
  9  8 permits and for permits to acquire pistols or revolvers, and
  9  9 including effective date and applicability provisions.
  9 10    POSSESSION AND VERIFICATION OF PERMIT TO CARRY WEAPONS ====
  9 11 FINE.  The bill under Code section 724.5 makes it a simple
  9 12 misdemeanor punishable by a $10 scheduled fine if a person
  9 13 armed with a revolver, pistol, or pocket billy concealed upon
  9 14 the person does not possess the permit to carry weapons in the
  9 15 immediate possession of the person, and fails to produce such
  9 16 permit for inspection upon the request of a peace officer.
  9 17 The bill specifies that a peace officer shall verify through
  9 18 electronic means, if possible, the validity of the person's
  9 19 permit to carry weapons. Current law provides that if a
  9 20 person commits such a violation the person commits a simple
  9 21 misdemeanor.
  9 22    DURABLE COPY OF PERMIT.  The bill requires that the
  9 23 department of public safety, in addition to the sheriff issuing
  9 24 a nonprofessional permit to carry weapons, issue a durable
  9 25 copy of the nonprofessional permit to carry weapons to the
  9 26 permit holder.  The bill provides that within 14 days after
  9 27 the sheriff has issued an initial, renewal, or duplicate
  9 28 permit to carry weapons, the sheriff shall transmit the permit
  9 29 holder's information to the department of public safety for the
  9 30 department to issue the permit holder a more durable copy of
  9 31 the permit.  The bill requires the department of public safety
  9 32 to issue the more durable copy of the permit to the permit
  9 33 holder within 30 days of the permit holder's information being
  9 34 transmitted to the department.  The bill also provides that
  9 35 the durable copy of the permit issued pursuant to the bill
 10  1 shall be considered a valid permit in addition to the permit
 10  2 issued by the sheriff. The bill specifies that the durable
 10  3 copy of the permit shall have a uniform appearance, size,
 10  4 and content prescribed and published by the commissioner of
 10  5 public safety and shall contain the name of the permit holder
 10  6 and the effective date of the permit, but shall not contain
 10  7 the permit holder's social security number or photograph and
 10  8 shall not contain information about a particular weapon or any
 10  9 ammunition.
 10 10    INTERNET HANDGUN SAFETY TRAINING COURSE.  The bill provides
 10 11 in Code section 724.9 that the handgun safety training course
 10 12 required to obtain a permit to carry under Code section 724.11
 10 13 may be conducted over the internet in a live or web=based
 10 14 format, as long as completion of the course is verified by the
 10 15 instructor or provider of the course.
 10 16    ISSUANCE OF PERMIT TO CARRY OR RENEWAL ==== TRAINING
 10 17 REQUIREMENTS.  Under current law, prior to issuing any renewal
 10 18 of a permit to carry weapons, the sheriff or commissioner under
 10 19 Code section 724.11 shall determine if the requirements of Code
 10 20 sections 724.6, 724.7, 724.8, 724.9, and 724.10 have been met.
 10 21 The bill provides for additional or alternative requirements
 10 22 under certain circumstances.
 10 23    The bill provides that beginning with the first renewal of
 10 24 a permit issued after the calendar year 2010, and alternating
 10 25 renewals thereafter, if a renewal applicant applies within 30
 10 26 days prior to the expiration of the permit or within 30 days
 10 27 after expiration of the permit, the training requirements of
 10 28 Code section 724.9(1) do not apply.
 10 29    The bill provides that beginning with the second renewal of
 10 30 a permit issued after the calendar year 2010, and alternating
 10 31 renewals thereafter, if a renewal applicant applies within
 10 32 30 days prior to the expiration of the permit or within 30
 10 33 days after expiration of the permit, a renewal applicant shall
 10 34 qualify by taking an online training course certified by the
 10 35 national rifle association or the Iowa law enforcement academy,
 11  1 and the training program requirements of Code section 724.9(1)
 11  2 do not apply.
 11  3    If any renewal applicant applies more than 30 days after
 11  4 the expiration of the permit, the bill specifies the training
 11  5 program requirements in Code section 724.9(1) do apply to the
 11  6 applicant, and any subsequent renewal of this permit shall be
 11  7 considered a first renewal for purposes of determining the
 11  8 training requirements.
 11  9    The bill specifies that the training program requirements
 11 10 in Code section 724.9(1) do not apply to a renewal applicant
 11 11 who is able to demonstrate completion of small arms training
 11 12 (military) as specified in Code section 724.9(1)(d).  For all
 11 13 other renewal applicants who have applied more than 30 days
 11 14 after the expiration of the permit, the bill allows, in lieu of
 11 15 the training program requirements in Code section 724.9(1), the
 11 16 renewal applicant to choose to qualify on a firing range under
 11 17 the supervision of an instructor certified by the national
 11 18 rifle association or the department of public safety or another
 11 19 state's department of public safety, state police department,
 11 20 or similar certifying body.
 11 21    As an alternative, a renewal applicant, under the bill, may
 11 22 choose to qualify at any renewal, under the training program
 11 23 requirements in Code section 724.9(1), or the renewal applicant
 11 24 may choose to qualify on a firing range under the supervision
 11 25 of an instructor certified by the national rifle association
 11 26 or the department of public safety or another state's
 11 27 department of public safety, state police department, or
 11 28 similar certifying body. Such training or qualification must
 11 29 occur within the 24=month period prior to the expiration of
 11 30 the applicant's current permit, except that the 24=month time
 11 31 period limitation to complete the training or qualification
 11 32 does not apply to an applicant who is able to demonstrate
 11 33 completion of small arms training (military) as specified in
 11 34 Code section 724.9(1)(d).
 11 35    RENEWAL FEE.  The bill does not increase or decrease the
 12  1 fee for a renewal of a permit to carry weapons but does allow
 12  2 a renewal applicant to pay the $25 renewal application fee
 12  3 if the renewal applicant applies within 30 days prior to
 12  4 the expiration of the permit or within 30 days after such
 12  5 expiration.  Current law requires that in order to be assessed
 12  6 the $25 renewal application fee, the renewal applicant must
 12  7 apply at least 30 days prior to the expiration of the permit to
 12  8 carry weapons.
 12  9    TRANSFER OF REGULATION OF PERMIT.  The bill specifies that
 12 10 the department of public safety shall by rule specify the
 12 11 procedure to transfer the regulation of a nonprofessional
 12 12 permit holder's permit to another sheriff for the purposes of
 12 13 issuing a renewal or duplicate permit, or complying with Code
 12 14 section 724.13 relating to permit suspensions and revocations
 12 15 and criminal history background checks, if the permit holder
 12 16 has changed residences from one county to another county since
 12 17 the issuance of the permit.
 12 18    CONFIDENTIALITY.  The bill provides in Code section
 12 19 724.23 that, notwithstanding any other law or rule to the
 12 20 contrary, the commissioner of public safety and any issuing
 12 21 officer (county sheriff) shall keep confidential personally

 13 10 or in person, requests whether another person possesses a
 13 11 professional or nonprofessional permit to carry weapons or a

 14 22 dealer or seller about the legality of a transfer of a firearm
 14 23 or ammunition commits a class "D" felony.  Any person who
 14 24 willfully procures another to engage in conduct prohibited by
 14 25 this new Code section shall be held accountable as a principal.
 14 26    The new Code section does not apply to a law enforcement

  9 29 holder's information to the department of public safety for the
  9 30 department to issue the permit holder a more durable copy of
  9 31 the permit.  The bill requires the department of public safety
  9 32 to issue the more durable copy of the permit to the permit
  9 33 holder within 30 days of the permit holder's information being

 10 25 renewals thereafter, if a renewal applicant applies within 30
 10 26 days prior to the expiration of the permit or within 30 days
 10 27 after expiration of the permit, the training requirements of
 10 28 Code section 724.9(1) do not apply.
 10 29    The bill provides that beginning with the second renewal of
 10 30 a permit issued after the calendar year 2010, and alternating

 11 13 other renewal applicants who have applied more than 30 days
 11 14 after the expiration of the permit, the bill allows, in lieu of
 11 15 the training program requirements in Code section 724.9(1), the
 11 16 renewal applicant to choose to qualify on a firing range under
 11 17 the supervision of an instructor certified by the national
 11 18 rifle association or the department of public safety or another

 11 24 may choose to qualify on a firing range under the supervision
 11 25 of an instructor certified by the national rifle association

 12 13 issuing a renewal or duplicate permit, or complying with Code
 12 14 section 724.13 relating to permit suspensions and revocations

 14 23 or ammunition commits a class "D" felony.  Any person who
 14 24 willfully procures another to engage in conduct prohibited by
 14 25 this new Code section shall be held accountable as a principal.

 12 14 section 724.13 relating to permit suspensions and revocations

 13 10 or in person, requests whether another person possesses a
 13 11 professional or nonprofessional permit to carry weapons or a

 13  7 the employee or agent.
 13  8    The bill also permits the release of confidential
 13  9 information to a member of the public, if the person in writing
 13 10 or in person, requests whether another person possesses a
 13 11 professional or nonprofessional permit to carry weapons or a

 13 14 requesting the information must provide the department of
 13 15 public safety or issuing officer with the member's name and
 13 16 the reason for the request in writing and on a form prescribed
 13 17 by the department of public safety even if the person appears

 14 23 or ammunition commits a class "D" felony.  Any person who
 14 24 willfully procures another to engage in conduct prohibited by
 14 25 this new Code section shall be held accountable as a principal.

 11 25 of an instructor certified by the national rifle association
 11 26 or the department of public safety or another state's

 11 28 similar certifying body. Such training or qualification must
 11 29 occur within the 24=month period prior to the expiration of
 11 30 the applicant's current permit, except that the 24=month time
 11 31 period limitation to complete the training or qualification

 12 14 section 724.13 relating to permit suspensions and revocations

 12 21 officer (county sheriff) shall keep confidential personally
 12 22 identifiable information of applicants and holders of
 12 23 nonprofessional permits to carry weapons and permits to
 12 24 acquire pistols or revolvers. The release of any confidential

 13  1 agency investigating a violation of law where probable cause
 13  2 exists, the release for purposes of conducting a background

 13  7 the employee or agent.
 13  8    The bill also permits the release of confidential
 13  9 information to a member of the public, if the person in writing
 13 10 or in person, requests whether another person possesses a
 13 11 professional or nonprofessional permit to carry weapons or a
 13 12 permit to acquire pistols or revolvers.  Prior to the release
 13 13 of the information under the bill, the member of the public
 13 14 requesting the information must provide the department of
 13 15 public safety or issuing officer with the member's name and
 13 16 the reason for the request in writing and on a form prescribed
 13 17 by the department of public safety even if the person appears
 13 18 in person to request such information.  The bill requires the
 13 19 request to include the name of the other person and one of
 13 20 the following personal identifiers: the date of birth of the
 13 21 person, the address of the person, or the telephone number of

 13 26 safety shall be limited to an acknowledgment as to whether the
 13 27 person possesses a professional or nonprofessional permit to
 13 28 carry weapons or a permit to acquire pistols or revolvers,

 14 12    FRAUDULENT TRANSFER OF FIREARMS OR AMMUNITION.  The
 14 13 bill creates a new Code section to provide that a person
 14 14 who knowingly solicits, persuades, encourages, or entices

 14 16 or ammunition to transfer a firearm or ammunition under
 14 17 circumstances that the person knows would violate the laws
 14 18 of this state or of the United States commits a class "D"
 14 19 felony.  A person who knowingly provides materially false

 14 21 firearms or ammunition with the intent to deceive the firearms
 14 22 dealer or seller about the legality of a transfer of a firearm
 14 23 or ammunition commits a class "D" felony.  Any person who
 14 24 willfully procures another to engage in conduct prohibited by
 14 25 this new Code section shall be held accountable as a principal.
 14 26    The new Code section does not apply to a law enforcement
