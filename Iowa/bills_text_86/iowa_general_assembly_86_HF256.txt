  1 19    1.  a.  If the department or a local authority uses a fixed
  1 20 automated traffic law enforcement system to monitor a street,
  1 21 road, or highway in this state, the department or the local
  1 22 authority shall post a permanent sign at least five hundred
  1 23 feet, but no more than one thousand feet, in advance of the
  1 24 location where the system is in use to advise drivers that the
  1 25 system is in place.
  1 26    b.  If the department or a local authority uses a mobile
  1 27 automated traffic law enforcement system to monitor a street,
  1 28 road, or highway in this state, the department or the local
  1 29 authority shall post a temporary sign at least five hundred
  1 30 feet, but no more than one thousand feet, in advance of the
  1 31 location where the system is in use to advise drivers that the
  1 32 system is in place.
  1 33    2.  The signage required by this section shall be as
  1 34 prescribed by the manual on uniform traffic=control devices
  1 35 adopted by the department pursuant to section 321.252.
  2  1    Sec. 3.  IMPLEMENTATION OF ACT.  Section 25B.2, subsection
  2  2 3, shall not apply to this Act.

  2  4 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  2  5 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  2  6    Current administrative rules require signage in advance
  2  7 of the location of automated traffic law enforcement systems
  2  8 located on roads under the jurisdiction of the department of
  2  9 transportation (DOT).  This bill codifies these provisions and
  2 10 requires the DOT and local authorities to use such signage on
  2 11 all streets, roads, and highways in the state.
  2 12    The bill defines "automated traffic law enforcement system"
  2 13 as a device with one or more sensors working in conjunction
  2 14 with an official traffic=control signal, a speed measuring
  2 15 device, a railroad grade crossing signal light, or any other
  2 16 official traffic=control device.
  2 17    The bill requires the DOT and local authorities to post signs
  2 18 indicating the presence of an automated traffic law enforcement
  2 19 system at least 500 feet, but no more than 1,000 feet, in
  2 20 advance of the location of the system to advise drivers that
  2 21 the system is in place. In addition, the bill provides that
  2 22 fixed systems require permanent signage, and mobile systems
  2 23 require temporary signage. The signage required shall be as
  2 24 prescribed by the manual on uniform traffic=control devices
  2 25 adopted by the DOT.
  2 26    The bill may include a state mandate as defined in Code
  2 27 section 25B.3.  The bill makes inapplicable Code section 25B.2,
  2 28 subsection 3, which would relieve a political subdivision from
  2 29 complying with a state mandate if funding for the cost of
  2 30 the state mandate is not provided or specified.  Therefore,
  2 31 political subdivisions are required to comply with any state
  2 32 mandate included in the bill.
