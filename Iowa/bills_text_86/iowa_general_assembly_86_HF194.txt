  2  4    This bill relates to the statute=of=repose period in a
  2  5 case arising out of the unsafe or defective condition of an
  2  6 improvement to nonresidential construction.
  2  7    Under current law, a case arising out of the unsafe or
  2  8 defective condition of an improvement to real property, whether
  2  9 residential or nonresidential construction, is subject to
  2 10 a 15=year statute of repose. Such cases are based upon an
  2 11 injury to property or an injury or death of a person. The bill
  2 12 reduces the period of the statute of repose for cases relating
  2 13 to nonresidential construction from 15 years to 10 years. The
  2 14 statute=of=repose period for cases relating to residential
  2 15 construction remains 15 years.
  2 16    The bill defines "residential construction" by cross
  2 17 reference to the definition of that term contained in Code
  2 18 chapter 572, which relates to mechanic's liens. Code section
  2 19 572.1 defines "residential construction" as construction on
  2 20 single=family or two=family dwellings occupied or used, or
  2 21 intended to be occupied or used, primarily for residential
  2 22 purposes. The bill defines "nonresidential construction" as
  2 23 any construction that is not residential construction.
  2 24    A statute=of=repose period differs from a
  2 25 statute=of=limitations period in that a statute of repose
  2 26 establishes a time period after which a lawsuit based upon
  2 27 negligence in an improvement to real property cannot be filed
  2 28 regardless of whether an injury to a person or to property has
  2 29 occurred. A statute=of=limitations period begins at the date
  2 30 of the injury or upon discovery of the deficiency.
  2 31    The bill does not reduce the statute of repose for
  2 32 residential and nonresidential construction projects in
  2 33 existence prior to the effective date of the Act.
