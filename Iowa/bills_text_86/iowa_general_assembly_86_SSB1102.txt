technology
provides
a
mechanism
to
transform

of
20


health
and
medical
care
in
Iowa
and

quality
and

increase
31


efficiencies
in
administrative
health
care,
reduce

network
by
the
9


department
of
public
health,
an
electronic
health
information
10


advisory
council,
and
an
executive
committee.
The
bill
instead
11


places
these
functions
under
a
designated
entity,
which
is
a
12


nonprofit
corporation
designated
by
the
department
through
a
13


competitive
process
as
the
entity
responsible
for
administering
14


and
governing
the
network.
The
bill
includes
definitions,
15

requirements
for
the
composition
and
18


duties
of
the
board
of
directors
of
the
designated
entity,
and
19


legal
and
policy
requirements.
These
provisions
take
effect
20


only
upon
the
assumption
of
the
administration
and
governance
21


of
the
network
by
the
designated
entity.

The
bill
makes
changes

24


and
“record
locator
service”;
the
sharing
of
patient
health
25


information
available
through
the
record
locator
service;
26


and
the
privacy
and
security
requirements
applicable
to
the
27


sharing
of
patient

by
participants
authorized
28


to
use
the
record
locator
service
for
treatments,
payment,
29


health
care
operations,
public
health
activities,
and
care
30


coordination.
The
provisions
are
effective
upon
enactment
and
31


would
continue
in
effect
through
the
transition
period.
The
32


bill
also
provides
for
the

of
the
administration
33


and
governance
of
the
Iowa
health
information
network
to
the
34


designated
entity
and
provides
for
the
repeal
of
