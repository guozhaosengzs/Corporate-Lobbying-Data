  5 12                           EXPLANATION
  5 13 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  5 14 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  5 15    This bill requires certain peace officers, including tribal
  5 16 law enforcement officers, to wear a body camera.
  5 17    The bill defines "agency" to mean a law enforcement agency.
  5 18    The bill defines "body camera" to mean an electronic device
  5 19 that is capable of recording video and audio data or capable of
  5 20 transmitting video and audio data to be recorded remotely, and
  5 21 is worn on the person of a peace officer.
  5 22    The body camera requirement applies to a county sheriff
  5 23 or deputy sheriff, city peace officer, peace officer member
  5 24 of the department of public safety, peace officer at a
  5 25 regents institution, conservation officer, an employee of the
  5 26 department of transportation designated as a peace officer,
  5 27 an employee of an aviation authority designated as a peace
  5 28 officer, and a certified tribal law enforcement officer.
  5 29    The bill requires a peace officer to wear a body camera
  5 30 at all times while on duty and in uniform.  The bill further
  5 31 requires that the peace officer record all interactions with
  5 32 people in the performance of the official duties of the peace
  5 33 officer from the beginning to the end of those interactions.
  5 34    The bill specifies that a body camera must be worn on the
  5 35 chest or at the eye level of the peace officer.
  6  1 The bill prohibits a body camera from containing facial
  6  2 recognition technology unless the use of such technology has
  6  3 been authorized by the court pursuant to an arrest or search
  6  4 warrant.
  6  5    The bill requires a peace officer to inform a person when
  6  6 that person is being recorded by a body camera unless informing
  6  7 the person would be unsafe, impractical, or impossible.
  6  8    If a peace officer who is wearing a body camera enters a
  6  9 residence without a warrant or where no exigent circumstances
  6 10 exist, the bill requires that the peace officer immediately ask
  6 11 whether the resident desires the peace officer to stop the body
  6 12 camera recording while the peace officer is in the residence.
  6 13 If the person responds in the affirmative, the bill requires
  6 14 the peace officer to stop the body camera recording.  The bill
  6 15 also requires the peace officer to record the question and any
  6 16 answer to the question.
  6 17    If a peace officer wearing a body camera interacts with a
  6 18 person reporting a crime, providing information regarding a
  6 19 crime or ongoing investigation, or claiming to be a victim of a
  6 20 crime, the bill requires the peace officer to immediately ask
  6 21 whether the person desires the peace officer to stop the body
  6 22 camera recording of the interaction.  If the person responds in
  6 23 the affirmative, the bill requires the peace officer to stop
  6 24 the body camera recording.  The bill also requires the peace
  6 25 officer to record the question and any answer to the question.
  6 26    The contents of a recording created by a body camera are
  6 27 confidential except as provided for in the bill.
  6 28    The bill requires that an agency shall retain the contents
  6 29 of a recording created by a body camera for 30 days.  However,
  6 30 an agency shall retain the contents of a recording created by
  6 31 a body camera for three years if any of the following apply:
  6 32 the recording depicts an incident involving the use of force;
  6 33 the recording depicts an incident that leads to detention or
  6 34 arrest of a person; the recording is relevant to a formal
  6 35 or informal complaint against a peace officer or agency; or
  7  1 a request has been made to retain the recording.  Under the
  7  2 bill, the contents of the recording may be retained even longer
  7  3 than three years if the contents may be relevant to a criminal
  7  4 prosecution.
  7  5    Any of the following persons may make a request that the
  7  6 contents of a recording created by a body camera be retained
  7  7 for three years: a person who is a part of the content of the
  7  8 recording; a person whose property has been seized or damaged
  7  9 in relation to, or is otherwise involved with, a crime that is
  7 10 related to the recording; a parent or guardian of a person who
  7 11 is part of the content of the recording or whose property was
  7 12 seized, damaged, or involved with a crime that is related to
  7 13 the recording; the attorney for a person who is part of the
  7 14 content of the recording or whose property was seized, damaged,
  7 15 or involved with a crime that is related to the recording; any
  7 16 other person if such person has been given written authority
  7 17 to disclose the contents of the recording by the person who
  7 18 is part of the content of the recording or whose property was
  7 19 seized or damaged.
  7 20    The bill provides that a person, who is not a part of the
  7 21 content of a recording created by a body camera, may request a
  7 22 copy of and receive such recording if each person who is part
  7 23 of the content of the recording consents in writing.
  7 24    Prior to deleting or disposing of the contents of a recording
  7 25 created by a body camera, the bill requires the person who has
  7 26 the responsibility of deleting or disposing of such a recording
  7 27 on behalf of the agency, to review all applicable and available
  7 28 records, files, and databases to ascertain whether any reason
  7 29 exists that the recording should not be disposed of or deleted.
  7 30    A peace officer who fails to record any interaction with
  7 31 a person or who fails to stop recording such interaction
  7 32 as required by the bill commits a violation. For a first
  7 33 violation of the bill a peace officer shall be given a written
  7 34 reprimand.  For a second or subsequent violation of the bill
  7 35 the peace officer shall be suspended until an investigation
  8  1 into the cause of the violation has been completed.
  8  2    The bill also provides that if an agency is unable to produce
  8  3 a body camera recording during a criminal prosecution or civil
  8  4 action, a rebuttable presumption arises that the recording
  8  5 would corroborate the version of the facts advanced by the
  8  6 defendant in the criminal action or the party opposing the
  8  7 peace officer or agency in the civil action.
  8  8    The bill specifies that an agency shall participate in any
  8  9 existing state or federal programs that fund or supplement
  8 10 the costs to purchase and maintain body cameras worn by peace
  8 11 officers.
  8 12    The bill may include a state mandate as defined in Code
  8 13 section 25B.3.  The bill makes inapplicable Code section 25B.2,
  8 14 subsection 3, which would relieve a political subdivision from
  8 15 complying with a state mandate if funding for the cost of
  8 16 the state mandate is not provided or specified.  Therefore,
  8 17 political subdivisions are required to comply with any state
  8 18 mandate included in the bill.

  5 15    This bill requires certain peace officers, including tribal
  5 16 law enforcement officers, to wear a body camera.
  5 17    The bill defines "agency" to mean a law enforcement agency.
  5 18    The bill defines "body camera" to mean an electronic device
  5 19 that is capable of recording video and audio data or capable of
  5 20 transmitting video and audio data to be recorded remotely, and

  6 26    The contents of a recording created by a body camera are
  6 27 confidential except as provided for in the bill.
  6 28    The bill requires that an agency shall retain the contents
  6 29 of a recording created by a body camera for 30 days.  However,
  6 30 an agency shall retain the contents of a recording created by
  6 31 a body camera for three years if any of the following apply:
  6 32 the recording depicts an incident involving the use of force;
  6 33 the recording depicts an incident that leads to detention or
  6 34 arrest of a person; the recording is relevant to a formal
  6 35 or informal complaint against a peace officer or agency; or
  7  1 a request has been made to retain the recording.  Under the
  7  2 bill, the contents of the recording may be retained even longer
  7  3 than three years if the contents may be relevant to a criminal
  7  4 prosecution.
  7  5    Any of the following persons may make a request that the
  7  6 contents of a recording created by a body camera be retained
  7  7 for three years: a person who is a part of the content of the
  7  8 recording; a person whose property has been seized or damaged
  7  9 in relation to, or is otherwise involved with, a crime that is
  7 10 related to the recording; a parent or guardian of a person who
  7 11 is part of the content of the recording or whose property was
  7 12 seized, damaged, or involved with a crime that is related to
  7 13 the recording; the attorney for a person who is part of the
  7 14 content of the recording or whose property was seized, damaged,
  7 15 or involved with a crime that is related to the recording; any
  7 16 other person if such person has been given written authority
  7 17 to disclose the contents of the recording by the person who
  7 18 is part of the content of the recording or whose property was
  7 19 seized or damaged.
  7 20    The bill provides that a person, who is not a part of the
  7 21 content of a recording created by a body camera, may request a
  7 22 copy of and receive such recording if each person who is part
  7 23 of the content of the recording consents in writing.
  7 24    Prior to deleting or disposing of the contents of a recording
  7 25 created by a body camera, the bill requires the person who has
  7 26 the responsibility of deleting or disposing of such a recording
  7 27 on behalf of the agency, to review all applicable and available
  7 28 records, files, and databases to ascertain whether any reason
  7 29 exists that the recording should not be disposed of or deleted.
  7 30    A peace officer who fails to record any interaction with
  7 31 a person or who fails to stop recording such interaction
  7 32 as required by the bill commits a violation. For a first
  7 33 violation of the bill a peace officer shall be given a written
  7 34 reprimand.  For a second or subsequent violation of the bill
  7 35 the peace officer shall be suspended until an investigation
  8  1 into the cause of the violation has been completed.
  8  2    The bill also provides that if an agency is unable to produce
  8  3 a body camera recording during a criminal prosecution or civil
  8  4 action, a rebuttable presumption arises that the recording
  8  5 would corroborate the version of the facts advanced by the
  8  6 defendant in the criminal action or the party opposing the
  8  7 peace officer or agency in the civil action.
  8  8    The bill specifies that an agency shall participate in any
  8  9 existing state or federal programs that fund or supplement
  8 10 the costs to purchase and maintain body cameras worn by peace
  8 11 officers.
  8 12    The bill may include a state mandate as defined in Code
  8 13 section 25B.3.  The bill makes inapplicable Code section 25B.2,
  8 14 subsection 3, which would relieve a political subdivision from
  8 15 complying with a state mandate if funding for the cost of
  8 16 the state mandate is not provided or specified.  Therefore,
  8 17 political subdivisions are required to comply with any state
  8 18 mandate included in the bill.

  5 12                           EXPLANATION
  5 13 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  5 14 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  5 15    This bill requires certain peace officers, including tribal
  5 16 law enforcement officers, to wear a body camera.
  5 17    The bill defines "agency" to mean a law enforcement agency.
  5 18    The bill defines "body camera" to mean an electronic device
  5 19 that is capable of recording video and audio data or capable of
  5 20 transmitting video and audio data to be recorded remotely, and
  5 21 is worn on the person of a peace officer.
  5 22    The body camera requirement applies to a county sheriff
  5 23 or deputy sheriff, city peace officer, peace officer member
  5 24 of the department of public safety, peace officer at a
  5 25 regents institution, conservation officer, an employee of the
  5 26 department of transportation designated as a peace officer,
  5 27 an employee of an aviation authority designated as a peace
  5 28 officer, and a certified tribal law enforcement officer.
  5 29    The bill requires a peace officer to wear a body camera
  5 30 at all times while on duty and in uniform.  The bill further
  5 31 requires that the peace officer record all interactions with
  5 32 people in the performance of the official duties of the peace
  5 33 officer from the beginning to the end of those interactions.
  5 34    The bill specifies that a body camera must be worn on the
  5 35 chest or at the eye level of the peace officer.
  6  1 The bill prohibits a body camera from containing facial
  6  2 recognition technology unless the use of such technology has
  6  3 been authorized by the court pursuant to an arrest or search
  6  4 warrant.
  6  5    The bill requires a peace officer to inform a person when
  6  6 that person is being recorded by a body camera unless informing
  6  7 the person would be unsafe, impractical, or impossible.
  6  8    If a peace officer who is wearing a body camera enters a
  6  9 residence without a warrant or where no exigent circumstances
  6 10 exist, the bill requires that the peace officer immediately ask
  6 11 whether the resident desires the peace officer to stop the body
  6 12 camera recording while the peace officer is in the residence.
  6 13 If the person responds in the affirmative, the bill requires
  6 14 the peace officer to stop the body camera recording.  The bill
  6 15 also requires the peace officer to record the question and any
  6 16 answer to the question.
  6 17    If a peace officer wearing a body camera interacts with a
  6 18 person reporting a crime, providing information regarding a
  6 19 crime or ongoing investigation, or claiming to be a victim of a
  6 20 crime, the bill requires the peace officer to immediately ask
  6 21 whether the person desires the peace officer to stop the body
  6 22 camera recording of the interaction.  If the person responds in
  6 23 the affirmative, the bill requires the peace officer to stop
  6 24 the body camera recording.  The bill also requires the peace
  6 25 officer to record the question and any answer to the question.
  6 26    The contents of a recording created by a body camera are
  6 27 confidential except as provided for in the bill.
  6 28    The bill requires that an agency shall retain the contents
  6 29 of a recording created by a body camera for 30 days.  However,
  6 30 an agency shall retain the contents of a recording created by
  6 31 a body camera for three years if any of the following apply:
  6 32 the recording depicts an incident involving the use of force;
  6 33 the recording depicts an incident that leads to detention or
  6 34 arrest of a person; the recording is relevant to a formal
  6 35 or informal complaint against a peace officer or agency; or
  7  1 a request has been made to retain the recording.  Under the
  7  2 bill, the contents of the recording may be retained even longer
  7  3 than three years if the contents may be relevant to a criminal
  7  4 prosecution.
  7  5    Any of the following persons may make a request that the
  7  6 contents of a recording created by a body camera be retained
  7  7 for three years: a person who is a part of the content of the
  7  8 recording; a person whose property has been seized or damaged
  7  9 in relation to, or is otherwise involved with, a crime that is
  7 10 related to the recording; a parent or guardian of a person who
  7 11 is part of the content of the recording or whose property was
  7 12 seized, damaged, or involved with a crime that is related to
  7 13 the recording; the attorney for a person who is part of the
  7 14 content of the recording or whose property was seized, damaged,
  7 15 or involved with a crime that is related to the recording; any
  7 16 other person if such person has been given written authority
  7 17 to disclose the contents of the recording by the person who
  7 18 is part of the content of the recording or whose property was
  7 19 seized or damaged.
  7 20    The bill provides that a person, who is not a part of the
  7 21 content of a recording created by a body camera, may request a
  7 22 copy of and receive such recording if each person who is part
  7 23 of the content of the recording consents in writing.
  7 24    Prior to deleting or disposing of the contents of a recording
  7 25 created by a body camera, the bill requires the person who has
  7 26 the responsibility of deleting or disposing of such a recording
  7 27 on behalf of the agency, to review all applicable and available
  7 28 records, files, and databases to ascertain whether any reason
  7 29 exists that the recording should not be disposed of or deleted.
  7 30    A peace officer who fails to record any interaction with
  7 31 a person or who fails to stop recording such interaction
  7 32 as required by the bill commits a violation. For a first
  7 33 violation of the bill a peace officer shall be given a written
  7 34 reprimand.  For a second or subsequent violation of the bill
  7 35 the peace officer shall be suspended until an investigation
  8  1 into the cause of the violation has been completed.
  8  2    The bill also provides that if an agency is unable to produce
  8  3 a body camera recording during a criminal prosecution or civil
  8  4 action, a rebuttable presumption arises that the recording
  8  5 would corroborate the version of the facts advanced by the
  8  6 defendant in the criminal action or the party opposing the
  8  7 peace officer or agency in the civil action.
  8  8    The bill specifies that an agency shall participate in any
  8  9 existing state or federal programs that fund or supplement
  8 10 the costs to purchase and maintain body cameras worn by peace
  8 11 officers.
  8 12    The bill may include a state mandate as defined in Code
  8 13 section 25B.3.  The bill makes inapplicable Code section 25B.2,
  8 14 subsection 3, which would relieve a political subdivision from
  8 15 complying with a state mandate if funding for the cost of
  8 16 the state mandate is not provided or specified.  Therefore,
  8 17 political subdivisions are required to comply with any state
  8 18 mandate included in the bill.

  5  1 during a criminal prosecution or civil action which is required
  5  2 to be made and retained pursuant to this section, a rebuttable
  5  3 presumption arises that the recording would corroborate the

  5  6 civil action.
  5  7    9.  The agency shall participate in any existing state or

  5 12                           EXPLANATION
  5 13 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  5 14 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  5 15    This bill requires certain peace officers, including tribal
  5 16 law enforcement officers, to wear a body camera.
  5 17    The bill defines "agency" to mean a law enforcement agency.
  5 18    The bill defines "body camera" to mean an electronic device
  5 19 that is capable of recording video and audio data or capable of
  5 20 transmitting video and audio data to be recorded remotely, and
  5 21 is worn on the person of a peace officer.
  5 22    The body camera requirement applies to a county sheriff
  5 23 or deputy sheriff, city peace officer, peace officer member
  5 24 of the department of public safety, peace officer at a
  5 25 regents institution, conservation officer, an employee of the
  5 26 department of transportation designated as a peace officer,
  5 27 an employee of an aviation authority designated as a peace
  5 28 officer, and a certified tribal law enforcement officer.
  5 29    The bill requires a peace officer to wear a body camera
  5 30 at all times while on duty and in uniform.  The bill further
  5 31 requires that the peace officer record all interactions with
  5 32 people in the performance of the official duties of the peace
  5 33 officer from the beginning to the end of those interactions.
  5 34    The bill specifies that a body camera must be worn on the
  5 35 chest or at the eye level of the peace officer.
  6  1 The bill prohibits a body camera from containing facial
  6  2 recognition technology unless the use of such technology has
  6  3 been authorized by the court pursuant to an arrest or search
  6  4 warrant.
  6  5    The bill requires a peace officer to inform a person when
  6  6 that person is being recorded by a body camera unless informing
  6  7 the person would be unsafe, impractical, or impossible.
  6  8    If a peace officer who is wearing a body camera enters a
  6  9 residence without a warrant or where no exigent circumstances
  6 10 exist, the bill requires that the peace officer immediately ask
  6 11 whether the resident desires the peace officer to stop the body
  6 12 camera recording while the peace officer is in the residence.
  6 13 If the person responds in the affirmative, the bill requires
  6 14 the peace officer to stop the body camera recording.  The bill
  6 15 also requires the peace officer to record the question and any
  6 16 answer to the question.
  6 17    If a peace officer wearing a body camera interacts with a
  6 18 person reporting a crime, providing information regarding a
  6 19 crime or ongoing investigation, or claiming to be a victim of a
  6 20 crime, the bill requires the peace officer to immediately ask
  6 21 whether the person desires the peace officer to stop the body
  6 22 camera recording of the interaction.  If the person responds in
  6 23 the affirmative, the bill requires the peace officer to stop
  6 24 the body camera recording.  The bill also requires the peace
  6 25 officer to record the question and any answer to the question.
  6 26    The contents of a recording created by a body camera are
  6 27 confidential except as provided for in the bill.
  6 28    The bill requires that an agency shall retain the contents
  6 29 of a recording created by a body camera for 30 days.  However,
  6 30 an agency shall retain the contents of a recording created by
  6 31 a body camera for three years if any of the following apply:
  6 32 the recording depicts an incident involving the use of force;
  6 33 the recording depicts an incident that leads to detention or
  6 34 arrest of a person; the recording is relevant to a formal
  6 35 or informal complaint against a peace officer or agency; or
  7  1 a request has been made to retain the recording.  Under the
  7  2 bill, the contents of the recording may be retained even longer
  7  3 than three years if the contents may be relevant to a criminal
  7  4 prosecution.
  7  5    Any of the following persons may make a request that the
  7  6 contents of a recording created by a body camera be retained
  7  7 for three years: a person who is a part of the content of the
  7  8 recording; a person whose property has been seized or damaged
  7  9 in relation to, or is otherwise involved with, a crime that is
  7 10 related to the recording; a parent or guardian of a person who
  7 11 is part of the content of the recording or whose property was
  7 12 seized, damaged, or involved with a crime that is related to
  7 13 the recording; the attorney for a person who is part of the
  7 14 content of the recording or whose property was seized, damaged,
  7 15 or involved with a crime that is related to the recording; any
  7 16 other person if such person has been given written authority
  7 17 to disclose the contents of the recording by the person who
  7 18 is part of the content of the recording or whose property was
  7 19 seized or damaged.
  7 20    The bill provides that a person, who is not a part of the
  7 21 content of a recording created by a body camera, may request a
  7 22 copy of and receive such recording if each person who is part
  7 23 of the content of the recording consents in writing.
  7 24    Prior to deleting or disposing of the contents of a recording
  7 25 created by a body camera, the bill requires the person who has
  7 26 the responsibility of deleting or disposing of such a recording
  7 27 on behalf of the agency, to review all applicable and available
  7 28 records, files, and databases to ascertain whether any reason
  7 29 exists that the recording should not be disposed of or deleted.
  7 30    A peace officer who fails to record any interaction with
  7 31 a person or who fails to stop recording such interaction
  7 32 as required by the bill commits a violation. For a first
  7 33 violation of the bill a peace officer shall be given a written
  7 34 reprimand.  For a second or subsequent violation of the bill
  7 35 the peace officer shall be suspended until an investigation
  8  1 into the cause of the violation has been completed.
  8  2    The bill also provides that if an agency is unable to produce
  8  3 a body camera recording during a criminal prosecution or civil
  8  4 action, a rebuttable presumption arises that the recording
  8  5 would corroborate the version of the facts advanced by the
  8  6 defendant in the criminal action or the party opposing the
  8  7 peace officer or agency in the civil action.
  8  8    The bill specifies that an agency shall participate in any
  8  9 existing state or federal programs that fund or supplement
  8 10 the costs to purchase and maintain body cameras worn by peace
  8 11 officers.
  8 12    The bill may include a state mandate as defined in Code
  8 13 section 25B.3.  The bill makes inapplicable Code section 25B.2,
  8 14 subsection 3, which would relieve a political subdivision from
  8 15 complying with a state mandate if funding for the cost of
  8 16 the state mandate is not provided or specified.  Therefore,
  8 17 political subdivisions are required to comply with any state
  8 18 mandate included in the bill.

  6 33 the recording depicts an incident that leads to detention or
  6 34 arrest of a person; the recording is relevant to a formal
  6 35 or informal complaint against a peace officer or agency; or

  7  3 than three years if the contents may be relevant to a criminal
  7  4 prosecution.
  7  5    Any of the following persons may make a request that the

  7  7 for three years: a person who is a part of the content of the

  7 20    The bill provides that a person, who is not a part of the
  7 21 content of a recording created by a body camera, may request a
  7 22 copy of and receive such recording if each person who is part
  7 23 of the content of the recording consents in writing.
  7 24    Prior to deleting or disposing of the contents of a recording
  7 25 created by a body camera, the bill requires the person who has
  7 26 the responsibility of deleting or disposing of such a recording
  7 27 on behalf of the agency, to review all applicable and available
  7 28 records, files, and databases to ascertain whether any reason

  7 30    A peace officer who fails to record any interaction with
  7 31 a person or who fails to stop recording such interaction
  7 32 as required by the bill commits a violation. For a first
  7 33 violation of the bill a peace officer shall be given a written
  7 34 reprimand.  For a second or subsequent violation of the bill
  7 35 the peace officer shall be suspended until an investigation
  8  1 into the cause of the violation has been completed.
  8  2    The bill also provides that if an agency is unable to produce

  8  4 action, a rebuttable presumption arises that the recording
  8  5 would corroborate the version of the facts advanced by the
  8  6 defendant in the criminal action or the party opposing the
  8  7 peace officer or agency in the civil action.
  8  8    The bill specifies that an agency shall participate in any
  8  9 existing state or federal programs that fund or supplement
  8 10 the costs to purchase and maintain body cameras worn by peace
  8 11 officers.
  8 12    The bill may include a state mandate as defined in Code
  8 13 section 25B.3.  The bill makes inapplicable Code section 25B.2,
  8 14 subsection 3, which would relieve a political subdivision from
  8 15 complying with a state mandate if funding for the cost of
  8 16 the state mandate is not provided or specified.  Therefore,
  8 17 political subdivisions are required to comply with any state
  8 18 mandate included in the bill.

  5 12                           EXPLANATION
  5 13 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  5 14 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  5 15    This bill requires certain peace officers, including tribal
  5 16 law enforcement officers, to wear a body camera.
  5 17    The bill defines "agency" to mean a law enforcement agency.
  5 18    The bill defines "body camera" to mean an electronic device
  5 19 that is capable of recording video and audio data or capable of
  5 20 transmitting video and audio data to be recorded remotely, and
  5 21 is worn on the person of a peace officer.
  5 22    The body camera requirement applies to a county sheriff
  5 23 or deputy sheriff, city peace officer, peace officer member
  5 24 of the department of public safety, peace officer at a
  5 25 regents institution, conservation officer, an employee of the
  5 26 department of transportation designated as a peace officer,
  5 27 an employee of an aviation authority designated as a peace
  5 28 officer, and a certified tribal law enforcement officer.
  5 29    The bill requires a peace officer to wear a body camera
  5 30 at all times while on duty and in uniform.  The bill further
  5 31 requires that the peace officer record all interactions with
  5 32 people in the performance of the official duties of the peace
  5 33 officer from the beginning to the end of those interactions.
  5 34    The bill specifies that a body camera must be worn on the
  5 35 chest or at the eye level of the peace officer.
  6  1 The bill prohibits a body camera from containing facial
  6  2 recognition technology unless the use of such technology has
  6  3 been authorized by the court pursuant to an arrest or search
  6  4 warrant.
  6  5    The bill requires a peace officer to inform a person when
  6  6 that person is being recorded by a body camera unless informing
  6  7 the person would be unsafe, impractical, or impossible.
  6  8    If a peace officer who is wearing a body camera enters a
  6  9 residence without a warrant or where no exigent circumstances
  6 10 exist, the bill requires that the peace officer immediately ask
  6 11 whether the resident desires the peace officer to stop the body
  6 12 camera recording while the peace officer is in the residence.
  6 13 If the person responds in the affirmative, the bill requires
  6 14 the peace officer to stop the body camera recording.  The bill
  6 15 also requires the peace officer to record the question and any
  6 16 answer to the question.
  6 17    If a peace officer wearing a body camera interacts with a
  6 18 person reporting a crime, providing information regarding a
  6 19 crime or ongoing investigation, or claiming to be a victim of a
  6 20 crime, the bill requires the peace officer to immediately ask
  6 21 whether the person desires the peace officer to stop the body
  6 22 camera recording of the interaction.  If the person responds in
  6 23 the affirmative, the bill requires the peace officer to stop
  6 24 the body camera recording.  The bill also requires the peace
  6 25 officer to record the question and any answer to the question.
  6 26    The contents of a recording created by a body camera are
  6 27 confidential except as provided for in the bill.
  6 28    The bill requires that an agency shall retain the contents
  6 29 of a recording created by a body camera for 30 days.  However,
  6 30 an agency shall retain the contents of a recording created by
  6 31 a body camera for three years if any of the following apply:
  6 32 the recording depicts an incident involving the use of force;
  6 33 the recording depicts an incident that leads to detention or
  6 34 arrest of a person; the recording is relevant to a formal
  6 35 or informal complaint against a peace officer or agency; or
  7  1 a request has been made to retain the recording.  Under the
  7  2 bill, the contents of the recording may be retained even longer
  7  3 than three years if the contents may be relevant to a criminal
  7  4 prosecution.
  7  5    Any of the following persons may make a request that the
  7  6 contents of a recording created by a body camera be retained
  7  7 for three years: a person who is a part of the content of the
  7  8 recording; a person whose property has been seized or damaged
  7  9 in relation to, or is otherwise involved with, a crime that is
  7 10 related to the recording; a parent or guardian of a person who
  7 11 is part of the content of the recording or whose property was
  7 12 seized, damaged, or involved with a crime that is related to
  7 13 the recording; the attorney for a person who is part of the
  7 14 content of the recording or whose property was seized, damaged,
  7 15 or involved with a crime that is related to the recording; any
  7 16 other person if such person has been given written authority
  7 17 to disclose the contents of the recording by the person who
  7 18 is part of the content of the recording or whose property was
  7 19 seized or damaged.
  7 20    The bill provides that a person, who is not a part of the
  7 21 content of a recording created by a body camera, may request a
  7 22 copy of and receive such recording if each person who is part
  7 23 of the content of the recording consents in writing.
  7 24    Prior to deleting or disposing of the contents of a recording
  7 25 created by a body camera, the bill requires the person who has
  7 26 the responsibility of deleting or disposing of such a recording
  7 27 on behalf of the agency, to review all applicable and available
  7 28 records, files, and databases to ascertain whether any reason
  7 29 exists that the recording should not be disposed of or deleted.
  7 30    A peace officer who fails to record any interaction with
  7 31 a person or who fails to stop recording such interaction
  7 32 as required by the bill commits a violation. For a first
  7 33 violation of the bill a peace officer shall be given a written
  7 34 reprimand.  For a second or subsequent violation of the bill
  7 35 the peace officer shall be suspended until an investigation
  8  1 into the cause of the violation has been completed.
  8  2    The bill also provides that if an agency is unable to produce
  8  3 a body camera recording during a criminal prosecution or civil
  8  4 action, a rebuttable presumption arises that the recording
  8  5 would corroborate the version of the facts advanced by the
  8  6 defendant in the criminal action or the party opposing the
  8  7 peace officer or agency in the civil action.
  8  8    The bill specifies that an agency shall participate in any
  8  9 existing state or federal programs that fund or supplement
  8 10 the costs to purchase and maintain body cameras worn by peace
  8 11 officers.
  8 12    The bill may include a state mandate as defined in Code
  8 13 section 25B.3.  The bill makes inapplicable Code section 25B.2,
  8 14 subsection 3, which would relieve a political subdivision from
  8 15 complying with a state mandate if funding for the cost of
  8 16 the state mandate is not provided or specified.  Therefore,
  8 17 political subdivisions are required to comply with any state
  8 18 mandate included in the bill.

  2 17 exist, the peace officer shall immediately ask whether the

  2 19 recording while the peace officer is in the residence. If the
  2 20 resident responds in the affirmative, the peace officer shall
  2 21 stop the body camera recording.  The peace officer shall record
  2 22 the question required by this paragraph and any answer to the
  2 23 question.

  5 12                           EXPLANATION
  5 13 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  5 14 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  5 15    This bill requires certain peace officers, including tribal
  5 16 law enforcement officers, to wear a body camera.
  5 17    The bill defines "agency" to mean a law enforcement agency.
  5 18    The bill defines "body camera" to mean an electronic device
  5 19 that is capable of recording video and audio data or capable of
  5 20 transmitting video and audio data to be recorded remotely, and
  5 21 is worn on the person of a peace officer.
  5 22    The body camera requirement applies to a county sheriff
  5 23 or deputy sheriff, city peace officer, peace officer member
  5 24 of the department of public safety, peace officer at a
  5 25 regents institution, conservation officer, an employee of the
  5 26 department of transportation designated as a peace officer,

  5 28 officer, and a certified tribal law enforcement officer.
  5 29    The bill requires a peace officer to wear a body camera
  5 30 at all times while on duty and in uniform.  The bill further
  5 31 requires that the peace officer record all interactions with
  5 32 people in the performance of the official duties of the peace
  5 33 officer from the beginning to the end of those interactions.
  5 34    The bill specifies that a body camera must be worn on the
  5 35 chest or at the eye level of the peace officer.
  6  1 The bill prohibits a body camera from containing facial
  6  2 recognition technology unless the use of such technology has
  6  3 been authorized by the court pursuant to an arrest or search
  6  4 warrant.
  6  5    The bill requires a peace officer to inform a person when
  6  6 that person is being recorded by a body camera unless informing
  6  7 the person would be unsafe, impractical, or impossible.
  6  8    If a peace officer who is wearing a body camera enters a
  6  9 residence without a warrant or where no exigent circumstances
  6 10 exist, the bill requires that the peace officer immediately ask
  6 11 whether the resident desires the peace officer to stop the body
  6 12 camera recording while the peace officer is in the residence.
  6 13 If the person responds in the affirmative, the bill requires
  6 14 the peace officer to stop the body camera recording.  The bill
  6 15 also requires the peace officer to record the question and any
  6 16 answer to the question.
  6 17    If a peace officer wearing a body camera interacts with a
  6 18 person reporting a crime, providing information regarding a

  6 20 crime, the bill requires the peace officer to immediately ask
  6 21 whether the person desires the peace officer to stop the body
  6 22 camera recording of the interaction.  If the person responds in
  6 23 the affirmative, the bill requires the peace officer to stop
  6 24 the body camera recording.  The bill also requires the peace
  6 25 officer to record the question and any answer to the question.
  6 26    The contents of a recording created by a body camera are
  6 27 confidential except as provided for in the bill.
  6 28    The bill requires that an agency shall retain the contents
  6 29 of a recording created by a body camera for 30 days.  However,
  6 30 an agency shall retain the contents of a recording created by
  6 31 a body camera for three years if any of the following apply:
  6 32 the recording depicts an incident involving the use of force;
  6 33 the recording depicts an incident that leads to detention or
  6 34 arrest of a person; the recording is relevant to a formal
  6 35 or informal complaint against a peace officer or agency; or
  7  1 a request has been made to retain the recording.  Under the
  7  2 bill, the contents of the recording may be retained even longer
  7  3 than three years if the contents may be relevant to a criminal
  7  4 prosecution.
  7  5    Any of the following persons may make a request that the
  7  6 contents of a recording created by a body camera be retained
  7  7 for three years: a person who is a part of the content of the
  7  8 recording; a person whose property has been seized or damaged
  7  9 in relation to, or is otherwise involved with, a crime that is
  7 10 related to the recording; a parent or guardian of a person who
  7 11 is part of the content of the recording or whose property was
  7 12 seized, damaged, or involved with a crime that is related to
  7 13 the recording; the attorney for a person who is part of the
  7 14 content of the recording or whose property was seized, damaged,
  7 15 or involved with a crime that is related to the recording; any
  7 16 other person if such person has been given written authority
  7 17 to disclose the contents of the recording by the person who
  7 18 is part of the content of the recording or whose property was
  7 19 seized or damaged.
  7 20    The bill provides that a person, who is not a part of the
  7 21 content of a recording created by a body camera, may request a
  7 22 copy of and receive such recording if each person who is part
  7 23 of the content of the recording consents in writing.
  7 24    Prior to deleting or disposing of the contents of a recording
  7 25 created by a body camera, the bill requires the person who has
  7 26 the responsibility of deleting or disposing of such a recording
  7 27 on behalf of the agency, to review all applicable and available
  7 28 records, files, and databases to ascertain whether any reason
  7 29 exists that the recording should not be disposed of or deleted.
  7 30    A peace officer who fails to record any interaction with
  7 31 a person or who fails to stop recording such interaction
  7 32 as required by the bill commits a violation. For a first
  7 33 violation of the bill a peace officer shall be given a written
  7 34 reprimand.  For a second or subsequent violation of the bill
  7 35 the peace officer shall be suspended until an investigation
  8  1 into the cause of the violation has been completed.
  8  2    The bill also provides that if an agency is unable to produce
  8  3 a body camera recording during a criminal prosecution or civil
  8  4 action, a rebuttable presumption arises that the recording
  8  5 would corroborate the version of the facts advanced by the
  8  6 defendant in the criminal action or the party opposing the
  8  7 peace officer or agency in the civil action.
  8  8    The bill specifies that an agency shall participate in any
  8  9 existing state or federal programs that fund or supplement
  8 10 the costs to purchase and maintain body cameras worn by peace
  8 11 officers.
  8 12    The bill may include a state mandate as defined in Code
  8 13 section 25B.3.  The bill makes inapplicable Code section 25B.2,
  8 14 subsection 3, which would relieve a political subdivision from
  8 15 complying with a state mandate if funding for the cost of
  8 16 the state mandate is not provided or specified.  Therefore,
  8 17 political subdivisions are required to comply with any state
  8 18 mandate included in the bill.

  5 12                           EXPLANATION
  5 13 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  5 14 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  5 15    This bill requires certain peace officers, including tribal
  5 16 law enforcement officers, to wear a body camera.
  5 17    The bill defines "agency" to mean a law enforcement agency.
  5 18    The bill defines "body camera" to mean an electronic device
  5 19 that is capable of recording video and audio data or capable of
  5 20 transmitting video and audio data to be recorded remotely, and
  5 21 is worn on the person of a peace officer.
  5 22    The body camera requirement applies to a county sheriff
  5 23 or deputy sheriff, city peace officer, peace officer member
  5 24 of the department of public safety, peace officer at a
  5 25 regents institution, conservation officer, an employee of the
  5 26 department of transportation designated as a peace officer,
  5 27 an employee of an aviation authority designated as a peace
  5 28 officer, and a certified tribal law enforcement officer.
  5 29    The bill requires a peace officer to wear a body camera
  5 30 at all times while on duty and in uniform.  The bill further
  5 31 requires that the peace officer record all interactions with
  5 32 people in the performance of the official duties of the peace
  5 33 officer from the beginning to the end of those interactions.
  5 34    The bill specifies that a body camera must be worn on the
  5 35 chest or at the eye level of the peace officer.
  6  1 The bill prohibits a body camera from containing facial
  6  2 recognition technology unless the use of such technology has
  6  3 been authorized by the court pursuant to an arrest or search
  6  4 warrant.
  6  5    The bill requires a peace officer to inform a person when
  6  6 that person is being recorded by a body camera unless informing
  6  7 the person would be unsafe, impractical, or impossible.
  6  8    If a peace officer who is wearing a body camera enters a
  6  9 residence without a warrant or where no exigent circumstances
  6 10 exist, the bill requires that the peace officer immediately ask
  6 11 whether the resident desires the peace officer to stop the body
  6 12 camera recording while the peace officer is in the residence.
  6 13 If the person responds in the affirmative, the bill requires
  6 14 the peace officer to stop the body camera recording.  The bill
  6 15 also requires the peace officer to record the question and any
  6 16 answer to the question.
  6 17    If a peace officer wearing a body camera interacts with a
  6 18 person reporting a crime, providing information regarding a
  6 19 crime or ongoing investigation, or claiming to be a victim of a
  6 20 crime, the bill requires the peace officer to immediately ask
  6 21 whether the person desires the peace officer to stop the body
  6 22 camera recording of the interaction.  If the person responds in
  6 23 the affirmative, the bill requires the peace officer to stop
  6 24 the body camera recording.  The bill also requires the peace
  6 25 officer to record the question and any answer to the question.
  6 26    The contents of a recording created by a body camera are
  6 27 confidential except as provided for in the bill.
  6 28    The bill requires that an agency shall retain the contents
  6 29 of a recording created by a body camera for 30 days.  However,
  6 30 an agency shall retain the contents of a recording created by
  6 31 a body camera for three years if any of the following apply:
  6 32 the recording depicts an incident involving the use of force;
  6 33 the recording depicts an incident that leads to detention or
  6 34 arrest of a person; the recording is relevant to a formal
  6 35 or informal complaint against a peace officer or agency; or
  7  1 a request has been made to retain the recording.  Under the
  7  2 bill, the contents of the recording may be retained even longer
  7  3 than three years if the contents may be relevant to a criminal
  7  4 prosecution.
  7  5    Any of the following persons may make a request that the
  7  6 contents of a recording created by a body camera be retained
  7  7 for three years: a person who is a part of the content of the
  7  8 recording; a person whose property has been seized or damaged
  7  9 in relation to, or is otherwise involved with, a crime that is
  7 10 related to the recording; a parent or guardian of a person who
  7 11 is part of the content of the recording or whose property was
  7 12 seized, damaged, or involved with a crime that is related to
  7 13 the recording; the attorney for a person who is part of the
  7 14 content of the recording or whose property was seized, damaged,
  7 15 or involved with a crime that is related to the recording; any
  7 16 other person if such person has been given written authority
  7 17 to disclose the contents of the recording by the person who
  7 18 is part of the content of the recording or whose property was
  7 19 seized or damaged.
  7 20    The bill provides that a person, who is not a part of the
  7 21 content of a recording created by a body camera, may request a
  7 22 copy of and receive such recording if each person who is part
  7 23 of the content of the recording consents in writing.
  7 24    Prior to deleting or disposing of the contents of a recording
  7 25 created by a body camera, the bill requires the person who has
  7 26 the responsibility of deleting or disposing of such a recording
  7 27 on behalf of the agency, to review all applicable and available
  7 28 records, files, and databases to ascertain whether any reason
  7 29 exists that the recording should not be disposed of or deleted.
  7 30    A peace officer who fails to record any interaction with
  7 31 a person or who fails to stop recording such interaction
  7 32 as required by the bill commits a violation. For a first
  7 33 violation of the bill a peace officer shall be given a written
  7 34 reprimand.  For a second or subsequent violation of the bill
  7 35 the peace officer shall be suspended until an investigation
  8  1 into the cause of the violation has been completed.
  8  2    The bill also provides that if an agency is unable to produce
  8  3 a body camera recording during a criminal prosecution or civil
  8  4 action, a rebuttable presumption arises that the recording
  8  5 would corroborate the version of the facts advanced by the
  8  6 defendant in the criminal action or the party opposing the
  8  7 peace officer or agency in the civil action.
  8  8    The bill specifies that an agency shall participate in any
  8  9 existing state or federal programs that fund or supplement
  8 10 the costs to purchase and maintain body cameras worn by peace
  8 11 officers.
  8 12    The bill may include a state mandate as defined in Code
  8 13 section 25B.3.  The bill makes inapplicable Code section 25B.2,
  8 14 subsection 3, which would relieve a political subdivision from
  8 15 complying with a state mandate if funding for the cost of
  8 16 the state mandate is not provided or specified.  Therefore,
  8 17 political subdivisions are required to comply with any state
  8 18 mandate included in the bill.

  5 13 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  5 14 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  5 15    This bill requires certain peace officers, including tribal

  6  9 residence without a warrant or where no exigent circumstances
  6 10 exist, the bill requires that the peace officer immediately ask
  6 11 whether the resident desires the peace officer to stop the body
  6 12 camera recording while the peace officer is in the residence.
  6 13 If the person responds in the affirmative, the bill requires
  6 14 the peace officer to stop the body camera recording.  The bill
  6 15 also requires the peace officer to record the question and any
  6 16 answer to the question.
  6 17    If a peace officer wearing a body camera interacts with a
  6 18 person reporting a crime, providing information regarding a
  6 19 crime or ongoing investigation, or claiming to be a victim of a
  6 20 crime, the bill requires the peace officer to immediately ask
  6 21 whether the person desires the peace officer to stop the body
  6 22 camera recording of the interaction.  If the person responds in
  6 23 the affirmative, the bill requires the peace officer to stop
  6 24 the body camera recording.  The bill also requires the peace
  6 25 officer to record the question and any answer to the question.
  6 26    The contents of a recording created by a body camera are
  6 27 confidential except as provided for in the bill.
  6 28    The bill requires that an agency shall retain the contents
  6 29 of a recording created by a body camera for 30 days.  However,
  6 30 an agency shall retain the contents of a recording created by
  6 31 a body camera for three years if any of the following apply:
  6 32 the recording depicts an incident involving the use of force;
  6 33 the recording depicts an incident that leads to detention or
  6 34 arrest of a person; the recording is relevant to a formal
  6 35 or informal complaint against a peace officer or agency; or
  7  1 a request has been made to retain the recording.  Under the
  7  2 bill, the contents of the recording may be retained even longer
  7  3 than three years if the contents may be relevant to a criminal
  7  4 prosecution.
  7  5    Any of the following persons may make a request that the
  7  6 contents of a recording created by a body camera be retained
  7  7 for three years: a person who is a part of the content of the
  7  8 recording; a person whose property has been seized or damaged
  7  9 in relation to, or is otherwise involved with, a crime that is
  7 10 related to the recording; a parent or guardian of a person who
  7 11 is part of the content of the recording or whose property was
  7 12 seized, damaged, or involved with a crime that is related to
  7 13 the recording; the attorney for a person who is part of the
  7 14 content of the recording or whose property was seized, damaged,
  7 15 or involved with a crime that is related to the recording; any
  7 16 other person if such person has been given written authority
  7 17 to disclose the contents of the recording by the person who
  7 18 is part of the content of the recording or whose property was
  7 19 seized or damaged.
  7 20    The bill provides that a person, who is not a part of the
  7 21 content of a recording created by a body camera, may request a
  7 22 copy of and receive such recording if each person who is part
  7 23 of the content of the recording consents in writing.
  7 24    Prior to deleting or disposing of the contents of a recording
  7 25 created by a body camera, the bill requires the person who has
  7 26 the responsibility of deleting or disposing of such a recording
  7 27 on behalf of the agency, to review all applicable and available
  7 28 records, files, and databases to ascertain whether any reason
  7 29 exists that the recording should not be disposed of or deleted.
  7 30    A peace officer who fails to record any interaction with
  7 31 a person or who fails to stop recording such interaction
  7 32 as required by the bill commits a violation. For a first
  7 33 violation of the bill a peace officer shall be given a written
  7 34 reprimand.  For a second or subsequent violation of the bill
  7 35 the peace officer shall be suspended until an investigation
  8  1 into the cause of the violation has been completed.
  8  2    The bill also provides that if an agency is unable to produce
  8  3 a body camera recording during a criminal prosecution or civil
  8  4 action, a rebuttable presumption arises that the recording
  8  5 would corroborate the version of the facts advanced by the
  8  6 defendant in the criminal action or the party opposing the
  8  7 peace officer or agency in the civil action.
  8  8    The bill specifies that an agency shall participate in any
  8  9 existing state or federal programs that fund or supplement
  8 10 the costs to purchase and maintain body cameras worn by peace
  8 11 officers.
  8 12    The bill may include a state mandate as defined in Code
  8 13 section 25B.3.  The bill makes inapplicable Code section 25B.2,
  8 14 subsection 3, which would relieve a political subdivision from
  8 15 complying with a state mandate if funding for the cost of
  8 16 the state mandate is not provided or specified.  Therefore,
  8 17 political subdivisions are required to comply with any state
  8 18 mandate included in the bill.

  5 12                           EXPLANATION
  5 13 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  5 14 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  5 15    This bill requires certain peace officers, including tribal
  5 16 law enforcement officers, to wear a body camera.
  5 17    The bill defines "agency" to mean a law enforcement agency.
  5 18    The bill defines "body camera" to mean an electronic device
  5 19 that is capable of recording video and audio data or capable of
  5 20 transmitting video and audio data to be recorded remotely, and
  5 21 is worn on the person of a peace officer.
  5 22    The body camera requirement applies to a county sheriff
  5 23 or deputy sheriff, city peace officer, peace officer member
  5 24 of the department of public safety, peace officer at a
  5 25 regents institution, conservation officer, an employee of the
  5 26 department of transportation designated as a peace officer,
  5 27 an employee of an aviation authority designated as a peace
  5 28 officer, and a certified tribal law enforcement officer.
  5 29    The bill requires a peace officer to wear a body camera
  5 30 at all times while on duty and in uniform.  The bill further
  5 31 requires that the peace officer record all interactions with
  5 32 people in the performance of the official duties of the peace
  5 33 officer from the beginning to the end of those interactions.
  5 34    The bill specifies that a body camera must be worn on the
  5 35 chest or at the eye level of the peace officer.
  6  1 The bill prohibits a body camera from containing facial
  6  2 recognition technology unless the use of such technology has
  6  3 been authorized by the court pursuant to an arrest or search
  6  4 warrant.
  6  5    The bill requires a peace officer to inform a person when
  6  6 that person is being recorded by a body camera unless informing
  6  7 the person would be unsafe, impractical, or impossible.
  6  8    If a peace officer who is wearing a body camera enters a
  6  9 residence without a warrant or where no exigent circumstances
  6 10 exist, the bill requires that the peace officer immediately ask
  6 11 whether the resident desires the peace officer to stop the body
  6 12 camera recording while the peace officer is in the residence.
  6 13 If the person responds in the affirmative, the bill requires
  6 14 the peace officer to stop the body camera recording.  The bill
  6 15 also requires the peace officer to record the question and any
  6 16 answer to the question.
  6 17    If a peace officer wearing a body camera interacts with a
  6 18 person reporting a crime, providing information regarding a
  6 19 crime or ongoing investigation, or claiming to be a victim of a
  6 20 crime, the bill requires the peace officer to immediately ask
  6 21 whether the person desires the peace officer to stop the body
  6 22 camera recording of the interaction.  If the person responds in
  6 23 the affirmative, the bill requires the peace officer to stop
  6 24 the body camera recording.  The bill also requires the peace
  6 25 officer to record the question and any answer to the question.
  6 26    The contents of a recording created by a body camera are
  6 27 confidential except as provided for in the bill.
  6 28    The bill requires that an agency shall retain the contents
  6 29 of a recording created by a body camera for 30 days.  However,
  6 30 an agency shall retain the contents of a recording created by
  6 31 a body camera for three years if any of the following apply:
  6 32 the recording depicts an incident involving the use of force;
  6 33 the recording depicts an incident that leads to detention or
  6 34 arrest of a person; the recording is relevant to a formal
  6 35 or informal complaint against a peace officer or agency; or
  7  1 a request has been made to retain the recording.  Under the
  7  2 bill, the contents of the recording may be retained even longer
  7  3 than three years if the contents may be relevant to a criminal
  7  4 prosecution.
  7  5    Any of the following persons may make a request that the
  7  6 contents of a recording created by a body camera be retained
  7  7 for three years: a person who is a part of the content of the
  7  8 recording; a person whose property has been seized or damaged
  7  9 in relation to, or is otherwise involved with, a crime that is
  7 10 related to the recording; a parent or guardian of a person who
  7 11 is part of the content of the recording or whose property was
  7 12 seized, damaged, or involved with a crime that is related to
  7 13 the recording; the attorney for a person who is part of the
  7 14 content of the recording or whose property was seized, damaged,
  7 15 or involved with a crime that is related to the recording; any
  7 16 other person if such person has been given written authority
  7 17 to disclose the contents of the recording by the person who
  7 18 is part of the content of the recording or whose property was
  7 19 seized or damaged.
  7 20    The bill provides that a person, who is not a part of the
  7 21 content of a recording created by a body camera, may request a
  7 22 copy of and receive such recording if each person who is part
  7 23 of the content of the recording consents in writing.
  7 24    Prior to deleting or disposing of the contents of a recording
  7 25 created by a body camera, the bill requires the person who has
  7 26 the responsibility of deleting or disposing of such a recording
  7 27 on behalf of the agency, to review all applicable and available
  7 28 records, files, and databases to ascertain whether any reason
  7 29 exists that the recording should not be disposed of or deleted.
  7 30    A peace officer who fails to record any interaction with
  7 31 a person or who fails to stop recording such interaction
  7 32 as required by the bill commits a violation. For a first
  7 33 violation of the bill a peace officer shall be given a written
  7 34 reprimand.  For a second or subsequent violation of the bill
  7 35 the peace officer shall be suspended until an investigation
  8  1 into the cause of the violation has been completed.
  8  2    The bill also provides that if an agency is unable to produce
  8  3 a body camera recording during a criminal prosecution or civil
  8  4 action, a rebuttable presumption arises that the recording
  8  5 would corroborate the version of the facts advanced by the
  8  6 defendant in the criminal action or the party opposing the
  8  7 peace officer or agency in the civil action.
  8  8    The bill specifies that an agency shall participate in any
  8  9 existing state or federal programs that fund or supplement
  8 10 the costs to purchase and maintain body cameras worn by peace
  8 11 officers.
  8 12    The bill may include a state mandate as defined in Code
  8 13 section 25B.3.  The bill makes inapplicable Code section 25B.2,
  8 14 subsection 3, which would relieve a political subdivision from
  8 15 complying with a state mandate if funding for the cost of
  8 16 the state mandate is not provided or specified.  Therefore,
  8 17 political subdivisions are required to comply with any state
  8 18 mandate included in the bill.

  5  5 action or the party opposing the peace officer or agency in the
  5  6 civil action.
  5  7    9.  The agency shall participate in any existing state or

  5 12                           EXPLANATION
  5 13 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  5 14 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  5 15    This bill requires certain peace officers, including tribal
  5 16 law enforcement officers, to wear a body camera.
  5 17    The bill defines "agency" to mean a law enforcement agency.
  5 18    The bill defines "body camera" to mean an electronic device
  5 19 that is capable of recording video and audio data or capable of
  5 20 transmitting video and audio data to be recorded remotely, and
  5 21 is worn on the person of a peace officer.
  5 22    The body camera requirement applies to a county sheriff
  5 23 or deputy sheriff, city peace officer, peace officer member
  5 24 of the department of public safety, peace officer at a
  5 25 regents institution, conservation officer, an employee of the
  5 26 department of transportation designated as a peace officer,
  5 27 an employee of an aviation authority designated as a peace
  5 28 officer, and a certified tribal law enforcement officer.
  5 29    The bill requires a peace officer to wear a body camera
  5 30 at all times while on duty and in uniform.  The bill further
  5 31 requires that the peace officer record all interactions with
  5 32 people in the performance of the official duties of the peace
  5 33 officer from the beginning to the end of those interactions.
  5 34    The bill specifies that a body camera must be worn on the
  5 35 chest or at the eye level of the peace officer.
  6  1 The bill prohibits a body camera from containing facial
  6  2 recognition technology unless the use of such technology has
  6  3 been authorized by the court pursuant to an arrest or search
  6  4 warrant.
  6  5    The bill requires a peace officer to inform a person when
  6  6 that person is being recorded by a body camera unless informing
  6  7 the person would be unsafe, impractical, or impossible.
  6  8    If a peace officer who is wearing a body camera enters a
  6  9 residence without a warrant or where no exigent circumstances
  6 10 exist, the bill requires that the peace officer immediately ask
  6 11 whether the resident desires the peace officer to stop the body
  6 12 camera recording while the peace officer is in the residence.
  6 13 If the person responds in the affirmative, the bill requires
  6 14 the peace officer to stop the body camera recording.  The bill
  6 15 also requires the peace officer to record the question and any
  6 16 answer to the question.
  6 17    If a peace officer wearing a body camera interacts with a
  6 18 person reporting a crime, providing information regarding a
  6 19 crime or ongoing investigation, or claiming to be a victim of a
  6 20 crime, the bill requires the peace officer to immediately ask
  6 21 whether the person desires the peace officer to stop the body
  6 22 camera recording of the interaction.  If the person responds in
  6 23 the affirmative, the bill requires the peace officer to stop
  6 24 the body camera recording.  The bill also requires the peace
  6 25 officer to record the question and any answer to the question.
  6 26    The contents of a recording created by a body camera are
  6 27 confidential except as provided for in the bill.
  6 28    The bill requires that an agency shall retain the contents
  6 29 of a recording created by a body camera for 30 days.  However,
  6 30 an agency shall retain the contents of a recording created by
  6 31 a body camera for three years if any of the following apply:
  6 32 the recording depicts an incident involving the use of force;
  6 33 the recording depicts an incident that leads to detention or
  6 34 arrest of a person; the recording is relevant to a formal
  6 35 or informal complaint against a peace officer or agency; or
  7  1 a request has been made to retain the recording.  Under the
  7  2 bill, the contents of the recording may be retained even longer
  7  3 than three years if the contents may be relevant to a criminal
  7  4 prosecution.
  7  5    Any of the following persons may make a request that the
  7  6 contents of a recording created by a body camera be retained
  7  7 for three years: a person who is a part of the content of the
  7  8 recording; a person whose property has been seized or damaged
  7  9 in relation to, or is otherwise involved with, a crime that is
  7 10 related to the recording; a parent or guardian of a person who
  7 11 is part of the content of the recording or whose property was
  7 12 seized, damaged, or involved with a crime that is related to
  7 13 the recording; the attorney for a person who is part of the
  7 14 content of the recording or whose property was seized, damaged,
  7 15 or involved with a crime that is related to the recording; any
  7 16 other person if such person has been given written authority
  7 17 to disclose the contents of the recording by the person who
  7 18 is part of the content of the recording or whose property was
  7 19 seized or damaged.
  7 20    The bill provides that a person, who is not a part of the
  7 21 content of a recording created by a body camera, may request a
  7 22 copy of and receive such recording if each person who is part
  7 23 of the content of the recording consents in writing.
  7 24    Prior to deleting or disposing of the contents of a recording
  7 25 created by a body camera, the bill requires the person who has
  7 26 the responsibility of deleting or disposing of such a recording
  7 27 on behalf of the agency, to review all applicable and available
  7 28 records, files, and databases to ascertain whether any reason
  7 29 exists that the recording should not be disposed of or deleted.
  7 30    A peace officer who fails to record any interaction with
  7 31 a person or who fails to stop recording such interaction
  7 32 as required by the bill commits a violation. For a first
  7 33 violation of the bill a peace officer shall be given a written
  7 34 reprimand.  For a second or subsequent violation of the bill
  7 35 the peace officer shall be suspended until an investigation
  8  1 into the cause of the violation has been completed.
  8  2    The bill also provides that if an agency is unable to produce
  8  3 a body camera recording during a criminal prosecution or civil
  8  4 action, a rebuttable presumption arises that the recording
  8  5 would corroborate the version of the facts advanced by the
  8  6 defendant in the criminal action or the party opposing the
  8  7 peace officer or agency in the civil action.
  8  8    The bill specifies that an agency shall participate in any
  8  9 existing state or federal programs that fund or supplement
  8 10 the costs to purchase and maintain body cameras worn by peace
  8 11 officers.
  8 12    The bill may include a state mandate as defined in Code
  8 13 section 25B.3.  The bill makes inapplicable Code section 25B.2,
  8 14 subsection 3, which would relieve a political subdivision from
  8 15 complying with a state mandate if funding for the cost of
  8 16 the state mandate is not provided or specified.  Therefore,
  8 17 political subdivisions are required to comply with any state
  8 18 mandate included in the bill.

  5 12                           EXPLANATION
  5 13 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  5 14 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  5 15    This bill requires certain peace officers, including tribal
  5 16 law enforcement officers, to wear a body camera.
  5 17    The bill defines "agency" to mean a law enforcement agency.
  5 18    The bill defines "body camera" to mean an electronic device
  5 19 that is capable of recording video and audio data or capable of
  5 20 transmitting video and audio data to be recorded remotely, and
  5 21 is worn on the person of a peace officer.
  5 22    The body camera requirement applies to a county sheriff
  5 23 or deputy sheriff, city peace officer, peace officer member
  5 24 of the department of public safety, peace officer at a
  5 25 regents institution, conservation officer, an employee of the
  5 26 department of transportation designated as a peace officer,
  5 27 an employee of an aviation authority designated as a peace
  5 28 officer, and a certified tribal law enforcement officer.
  5 29    The bill requires a peace officer to wear a body camera
  5 30 at all times while on duty and in uniform.  The bill further
  5 31 requires that the peace officer record all interactions with
  5 32 people in the performance of the official duties of the peace
  5 33 officer from the beginning to the end of those interactions.
  5 34    The bill specifies that a body camera must be worn on the
  5 35 chest or at the eye level of the peace officer.
  6  1 The bill prohibits a body camera from containing facial
  6  2 recognition technology unless the use of such technology has
  6  3 been authorized by the court pursuant to an arrest or search
  6  4 warrant.
  6  5    The bill requires a peace officer to inform a person when
  6  6 that person is being recorded by a body camera unless informing
  6  7 the person would be unsafe, impractical, or impossible.
  6  8    If a peace officer who is wearing a body camera enters a
  6  9 residence without a warrant or where no exigent circumstances
  6 10 exist, the bill requires that the peace officer immediately ask
  6 11 whether the resident desires the peace officer to stop the body
  6 12 camera recording while the peace officer is in the residence.
  6 13 If the person responds in the affirmative, the bill requires
  6 14 the peace officer to stop the body camera recording.  The bill
  6 15 also requires the peace officer to record the question and any
  6 16 answer to the question.
  6 17    If a peace officer wearing a body camera interacts with a
  6 18 person reporting a crime, providing information regarding a
  6 19 crime or ongoing investigation, or claiming to be a victim of a
  6 20 crime, the bill requires the peace officer to immediately ask
  6 21 whether the person desires the peace officer to stop the body
  6 22 camera recording of the interaction.  If the person responds in
  6 23 the affirmative, the bill requires the peace officer to stop
  6 24 the body camera recording.  The bill also requires the peace
  6 25 officer to record the question and any answer to the question.
  6 26    The contents of a recording created by a body camera are
  6 27 confidential except as provided for in the bill.
  6 28    The bill requires that an agency shall retain the contents
  6 29 of a recording created by a body camera for 30 days.  However,
  6 30 an agency shall retain the contents of a recording created by
  6 31 a body camera for three years if any of the following apply:
  6 32 the recording depicts an incident involving the use of force;
  6 33 the recording depicts an incident that leads to detention or
  6 34 arrest of a person; the recording is relevant to a formal
  6 35 or informal complaint against a peace officer or agency; or
  7  1 a request has been made to retain the recording.  Under the
  7  2 bill, the contents of the recording may be retained even longer
  7  3 than three years if the contents may be relevant to a criminal
  7  4 prosecution.
  7  5    Any of the following persons may make a request that the
  7  6 contents of a recording created by a body camera be retained
  7  7 for three years: a person who is a part of the content of the
  7  8 recording; a person whose property has been seized or damaged
  7  9 in relation to, or is otherwise involved with, a crime that is
  7 10 related to the recording; a parent or guardian of a person who
  7 11 is part of the content of the recording or whose property was
  7 12 seized, damaged, or involved with a crime that is related to
  7 13 the recording; the attorney for a person who is part of the
  7 14 content of the recording or whose property was seized, damaged,
  7 15 or involved with a crime that is related to the recording; any
  7 16 other person if such person has been given written authority
  7 17 to disclose the contents of the recording by the person who
  7 18 is part of the content of the recording or whose property was
  7 19 seized or damaged.
  7 20    The bill provides that a person, who is not a part of the
  7 21 content of a recording created by a body camera, may request a
  7 22 copy of and receive such recording if each person who is part
  7 23 of the content of the recording consents in writing.
  7 24    Prior to deleting or disposing of the contents of a recording
  7 25 created by a body camera, the bill requires the person who has
  7 26 the responsibility of deleting or disposing of such a recording
  7 27 on behalf of the agency, to review all applicable and available
  7 28 records, files, and databases to ascertain whether any reason
  7 29 exists that the recording should not be disposed of or deleted.
  7 30    A peace officer who fails to record any interaction with
  7 31 a person or who fails to stop recording such interaction
  7 32 as required by the bill commits a violation. For a first
  7 33 violation of the bill a peace officer shall be given a written
  7 34 reprimand.  For a second or subsequent violation of the bill
  7 35 the peace officer shall be suspended until an investigation
  8  1 into the cause of the violation has been completed.
  8  2    The bill also provides that if an agency is unable to produce
  8  3 a body camera recording during a criminal prosecution or civil
  8  4 action, a rebuttable presumption arises that the recording
  8  5 would corroborate the version of the facts advanced by the
  8  6 defendant in the criminal action or the party opposing the
  8  7 peace officer or agency in the civil action.
  8  8    The bill specifies that an agency shall participate in any
  8  9 existing state or federal programs that fund or supplement
  8 10 the costs to purchase and maintain body cameras worn by peace
  8 11 officers.
  8 12    The bill may include a state mandate as defined in Code
  8 13 section 25B.3.  The bill makes inapplicable Code section 25B.2,
  8 14 subsection 3, which would relieve a political subdivision from
  8 15 complying with a state mandate if funding for the cost of
  8 16 the state mandate is not provided or specified.  Therefore,
  8 17 political subdivisions are required to comply with any state
  8 18 mandate included in the bill.

  4 22 records, files, and databases to ascertain whether any reason
  4 23 exists that the recording should not be deleted or disposed of
  4 24 under this section or under the policies of the agency. The

  4 26 of if such a reason exists.

  5  1 during a criminal prosecution or civil action which is required
  5  2 to be made and retained pursuant to this section, a rebuttable
  5  3 presumption arises that the recording would corroborate the

  5  6 civil action.
  5  7    9.  The agency shall participate in any existing state or

  5 12                           EXPLANATION
  5 13 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  5 14 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  5 15    This bill requires certain peace officers, including tribal
  5 16 law enforcement officers, to wear a body camera.
  5 17    The bill defines "agency" to mean a law enforcement agency.
  5 18    The bill defines "body camera" to mean an electronic device
  5 19 that is capable of recording video and audio data or capable of
  5 20 transmitting video and audio data to be recorded remotely, and
  5 21 is worn on the person of a peace officer.
  5 22    The body camera requirement applies to a county sheriff
  5 23 or deputy sheriff, city peace officer, peace officer member
  5 24 of the department of public safety, peace officer at a
  5 25 regents institution, conservation officer, an employee of the
  5 26 department of transportation designated as a peace officer,
  5 27 an employee of an aviation authority designated as a peace
  5 28 officer, and a certified tribal law enforcement officer.
  5 29    The bill requires a peace officer to wear a body camera
  5 30 at all times while on duty and in uniform.  The bill further
  5 31 requires that the peace officer record all interactions with
  5 32 people in the performance of the official duties of the peace
  5 33 officer from the beginning to the end of those interactions.
  5 34    The bill specifies that a body camera must be worn on the
  5 35 chest or at the eye level of the peace officer.
  6  1 The bill prohibits a body camera from containing facial
  6  2 recognition technology unless the use of such technology has
  6  3 been authorized by the court pursuant to an arrest or search
  6  4 warrant.
  6  5    The bill requires a peace officer to inform a person when
  6  6 that person is being recorded by a body camera unless informing
  6  7 the person would be unsafe, impractical, or impossible.
  6  8    If a peace officer who is wearing a body camera enters a
  6  9 residence without a warrant or where no exigent circumstances
  6 10 exist, the bill requires that the peace officer immediately ask
  6 11 whether the resident desires the peace officer to stop the body
  6 12 camera recording while the peace officer is in the residence.
  6 13 If the person responds in the affirmative, the bill requires
  6 14 the peace officer to stop the body camera recording.  The bill
  6 15 also requires the peace officer to record the question and any
  6 16 answer to the question.
  6 17    If a peace officer wearing a body camera interacts with a
  6 18 person reporting a crime, providing information regarding a
  6 19 crime or ongoing investigation, or claiming to be a victim of a
  6 20 crime, the bill requires the peace officer to immediately ask
  6 21 whether the person desires the peace officer to stop the body
  6 22 camera recording of the interaction.  If the person responds in
  6 23 the affirmative, the bill requires the peace officer to stop
  6 24 the body camera recording.  The bill also requires the peace
  6 25 officer to record the question and any answer to the question.
  6 26    The contents of a recording created by a body camera are
  6 27 confidential except as provided for in the bill.
  6 28    The bill requires that an agency shall retain the contents
  6 29 of a recording created by a body camera for 30 days.  However,
  6 30 an agency shall retain the contents of a recording created by
  6 31 a body camera for three years if any of the following apply:
  6 32 the recording depicts an incident involving the use of force;
  6 33 the recording depicts an incident that leads to detention or
  6 34 arrest of a person; the recording is relevant to a formal
  6 35 or informal complaint against a peace officer or agency; or
  7  1 a request has been made to retain the recording.  Under the
  7  2 bill, the contents of the recording may be retained even longer
  7  3 than three years if the contents may be relevant to a criminal
  7  4 prosecution.
  7  5    Any of the following persons may make a request that the
  7  6 contents of a recording created by a body camera be retained
  7  7 for three years: a person who is a part of the content of the
  7  8 recording; a person whose property has been seized or damaged
  7  9 in relation to, or is otherwise involved with, a crime that is
  7 10 related to the recording; a parent or guardian of a person who
  7 11 is part of the content of the recording or whose property was
  7 12 seized, damaged, or involved with a crime that is related to
  7 13 the recording; the attorney for a person who is part of the
  7 14 content of the recording or whose property was seized, damaged,
  7 15 or involved with a crime that is related to the recording; any
  7 16 other person if such person has been given written authority
  7 17 to disclose the contents of the recording by the person who
  7 18 is part of the content of the recording or whose property was
  7 19 seized or damaged.
  7 20    The bill provides that a person, who is not a part of the
  7 21 content of a recording created by a body camera, may request a
  7 22 copy of and receive such recording if each person who is part
  7 23 of the content of the recording consents in writing.
  7 24    Prior to deleting or disposing of the contents of a recording
  7 25 created by a body camera, the bill requires the person who has
  7 26 the responsibility of deleting or disposing of such a recording
  7 27 on behalf of the agency, to review all applicable and available
  7 28 records, files, and databases to ascertain whether any reason
  7 29 exists that the recording should not be disposed of or deleted.
  7 30    A peace officer who fails to record any interaction with
  7 31 a person or who fails to stop recording such interaction
  7 32 as required by the bill commits a violation. For a first
  7 33 violation of the bill a peace officer shall be given a written
  7 34 reprimand.  For a second or subsequent violation of the bill
  7 35 the peace officer shall be suspended until an investigation
  8  1 into the cause of the violation has been completed.
  8  2    The bill also provides that if an agency is unable to produce
  8  3 a body camera recording during a criminal prosecution or civil
  8  4 action, a rebuttable presumption arises that the recording
  8  5 would corroborate the version of the facts advanced by the
  8  6 defendant in the criminal action or the party opposing the
  8  7 peace officer or agency in the civil action.
  8  8    The bill specifies that an agency shall participate in any
  8  9 existing state or federal programs that fund or supplement
  8 10 the costs to purchase and maintain body cameras worn by peace
  8 11 officers.
  8 12    The bill may include a state mandate as defined in Code
  8 13 section 25B.3.  The bill makes inapplicable Code section 25B.2,
  8 14 subsection 3, which would relieve a political subdivision from
  8 15 complying with a state mandate if funding for the cost of
  8 16 the state mandate is not provided or specified.  Therefore,
  8 17 political subdivisions are required to comply with any state
  8 18 mandate included in the bill.

  5 12                           EXPLANATION
  5 13 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  5 14 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  5 15    This bill requires certain peace officers, including tribal
  5 16 law enforcement officers, to wear a body camera.
  5 17    The bill defines "agency" to mean a law enforcement agency.
  5 18    The bill defines "body camera" to mean an electronic device
  5 19 that is capable of recording video and audio data or capable of
  5 20 transmitting video and audio data to be recorded remotely, and
  5 21 is worn on the person of a peace officer.
  5 22    The body camera requirement applies to a county sheriff
  5 23 or deputy sheriff, city peace officer, peace officer member

  5 31 requires that the peace officer record all interactions with

  5 33 officer from the beginning to the end of those interactions.
  5 34    The bill specifies that a body camera must be worn on the

  6  1 The bill prohibits a body camera from containing facial

  6  5    The bill requires a peace officer to inform a person when
  6  6 that person is being recorded by a body camera unless informing
  6  7 the person would be unsafe, impractical, or impossible.
  6  8    If a peace officer who is wearing a body camera enters a
  6  9 residence without a warrant or where no exigent circumstances
  6 10 exist, the bill requires that the peace officer immediately ask
  6 11 whether the resident desires the peace officer to stop the body
  6 12 camera recording while the peace officer is in the residence.
  6 13 If the person responds in the affirmative, the bill requires
  6 14 the peace officer to stop the body camera recording.  The bill
  6 15 also requires the peace officer to record the question and any
  6 16 answer to the question.

  6 27 confidential except as provided for in the bill.
  6 28    The bill requires that an agency shall retain the contents
  6 29 of a recording created by a body camera for 30 days.  However,

  6 31 a body camera for three years if any of the following apply:
  6 32 the recording depicts an incident involving the use of force;
  6 33 the recording depicts an incident that leads to detention or
  6 34 arrest of a person; the recording is relevant to a formal
  6 35 or informal complaint against a peace officer or agency; or
  7  1 a request has been made to retain the recording.  Under the
  7  2 bill, the contents of the recording may be retained even longer
  7  3 than three years if the contents may be relevant to a criminal
  7  4 prosecution.
  7  5    Any of the following persons may make a request that the
  7  6 contents of a recording created by a body camera be retained
  7  7 for three years: a person who is a part of the content of the
  7  8 recording; a person whose property has been seized or damaged
  7  9 in relation to, or is otherwise involved with, a crime that is
  7 10 related to the recording; a parent or guardian of a person who
  7 11 is part of the content of the recording or whose property was

  7 17 to disclose the contents of the recording by the person who
  7 18 is part of the content of the recording or whose property was
  7 19 seized or damaged.
  7 20    The bill provides that a person, who is not a part of the
  7 21 content of a recording created by a body camera, may request a
  7 22 copy of and receive such recording if each person who is part
  7 23 of the content of the recording consents in writing.
  7 24    Prior to deleting or disposing of the contents of a recording
  7 25 created by a body camera, the bill requires the person who has
  7 26 the responsibility of deleting or disposing of such a recording
  7 27 on behalf of the agency, to review all applicable and available
  7 28 records, files, and databases to ascertain whether any reason
  7 29 exists that the recording should not be disposed of or deleted.
  7 30    A peace officer who fails to record any interaction with
  7 31 a person or who fails to stop recording such interaction
  7 32 as required by the bill commits a violation. For a first
  7 33 violation of the bill a peace officer shall be given a written
  7 34 reprimand.  For a second or subsequent violation of the bill
  7 35 the peace officer shall be suspended until an investigation
  8  1 into the cause of the violation has been completed.
  8  2    The bill also provides that if an agency is unable to produce
  8  3 a body camera recording during a criminal prosecution or civil
  8  4 action, a rebuttable presumption arises that the recording
  8  5 would corroborate the version of the facts advanced by the
  8  6 defendant in the criminal action or the party opposing the
  8  7 peace officer or agency in the civil action.
  8  8    The bill specifies that an agency shall participate in any
  8  9 existing state or federal programs that fund or supplement
  8 10 the costs to purchase and maintain body cameras worn by peace
  8 11 officers.
  8 12    The bill may include a state mandate as defined in Code
  8 13 section 25B.3.  The bill makes inapplicable Code section 25B.2,
  8 14 subsection 3, which would relieve a political subdivision from
  8 15 complying with a state mandate if funding for the cost of
  8 16 the state mandate is not provided or specified.  Therefore,
  8 17 political subdivisions are required to comply with any state
  8 18 mandate included in the bill.

  5 12                           EXPLANATION
  5 13 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  5 14 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  5 15    This bill requires certain peace officers, including tribal
  5 16 law enforcement officers, to wear a body camera.
  5 17    The bill defines "agency" to mean a law enforcement agency.
  5 18    The bill defines "body camera" to mean an electronic device
  5 19 that is capable of recording video and audio data or capable of
  5 20 transmitting video and audio data to be recorded remotely, and
  5 21 is worn on the person of a peace officer.
  5 22    The body camera requirement applies to a county sheriff
  5 23 or deputy sheriff, city peace officer, peace officer member
  5 24 of the department of public safety, peace officer at a
  5 25 regents institution, conservation officer, an employee of the
  5 26 department of transportation designated as a peace officer,
  5 27 an employee of an aviation authority designated as a peace
  5 28 officer, and a certified tribal law enforcement officer.
  5 29    The bill requires a peace officer to wear a body camera
  5 30 at all times while on duty and in uniform.  The bill further
  5 31 requires that the peace officer record all interactions with
  5 32 people in the performance of the official duties of the peace
  5 33 officer from the beginning to the end of those interactions.
  5 34    The bill specifies that a body camera must be worn on the
  5 35 chest or at the eye level of the peace officer.
  6  1 The bill prohibits a body camera from containing facial
  6  2 recognition technology unless the use of such technology has
  6  3 been authorized by the court pursuant to an arrest or search
  6  4 warrant.
  6  5    The bill requires a peace officer to inform a person when
  6  6 that person is being recorded by a body camera unless informing
  6  7 the person would be unsafe, impractical, or impossible.
  6  8    If a peace officer who is wearing a body camera enters a
  6  9 residence without a warrant or where no exigent circumstances
  6 10 exist, the bill requires that the peace officer immediately ask
  6 11 whether the resident desires the peace officer to stop the body
  6 12 camera recording while the peace officer is in the residence.
  6 13 If the person responds in the affirmative, the bill requires
  6 14 the peace officer to stop the body camera recording.  The bill
  6 15 also requires the peace officer to record the question and any
  6 16 answer to the question.
  6 17    If a peace officer wearing a body camera interacts with a
  6 18 person reporting a crime, providing information regarding a
  6 19 crime or ongoing investigation, or claiming to be a victim of a
  6 20 crime, the bill requires the peace officer to immediately ask
  6 21 whether the person desires the peace officer to stop the body
  6 22 camera recording of the interaction.  If the person responds in
  6 23 the affirmative, the bill requires the peace officer to stop
  6 24 the body camera recording.  The bill also requires the peace
  6 25 officer to record the question and any answer to the question.
  6 26    The contents of a recording created by a body camera are
  6 27 confidential except as provided for in the bill.
  6 28    The bill requires that an agency shall retain the contents
  6 29 of a recording created by a body camera for 30 days.  However,
  6 30 an agency shall retain the contents of a recording created by
  6 31 a body camera for three years if any of the following apply:
  6 32 the recording depicts an incident involving the use of force;
  6 33 the recording depicts an incident that leads to detention or
  6 34 arrest of a person; the recording is relevant to a formal
  6 35 or informal complaint against a peace officer or agency; or
  7  1 a request has been made to retain the recording.  Under the
  7  2 bill, the contents of the recording may be retained even longer
  7  3 than three years if the contents may be relevant to a criminal
  7  4 prosecution.
  7  5    Any of the following persons may make a request that the
  7  6 contents of a recording created by a body camera be retained
  7  7 for three years: a person who is a part of the content of the
  7  8 recording; a person whose property has been seized or damaged
  7  9 in relation to, or is otherwise involved with, a crime that is
  7 10 related to the recording; a parent or guardian of a person who
  7 11 is part of the content of the recording or whose property was
  7 12 seized, damaged, or involved with a crime that is related to
  7 13 the recording; the attorney for a person who is part of the
  7 14 content of the recording or whose property was seized, damaged,
  7 15 or involved with a crime that is related to the recording; any
  7 16 other person if such person has been given written authority
  7 17 to disclose the contents of the recording by the person who
  7 18 is part of the content of the recording or whose property was
  7 19 seized or damaged.
  7 20    The bill provides that a person, who is not a part of the
  7 21 content of a recording created by a body camera, may request a
  7 22 copy of and receive such recording if each person who is part
  7 23 of the content of the recording consents in writing.
  7 24    Prior to deleting or disposing of the contents of a recording
  7 25 created by a body camera, the bill requires the person who has
  7 26 the responsibility of deleting or disposing of such a recording
  7 27 on behalf of the agency, to review all applicable and available
  7 28 records, files, and databases to ascertain whether any reason
  7 29 exists that the recording should not be disposed of or deleted.
  7 30    A peace officer who fails to record any interaction with
  7 31 a person or who fails to stop recording such interaction
  7 32 as required by the bill commits a violation. For a first
  7 33 violation of the bill a peace officer shall be given a written
  7 34 reprimand.  For a second or subsequent violation of the bill
  7 35 the peace officer shall be suspended until an investigation
  8  1 into the cause of the violation has been completed.
  8  2    The bill also provides that if an agency is unable to produce
  8  3 a body camera recording during a criminal prosecution or civil
  8  4 action, a rebuttable presumption arises that the recording
  8  5 would corroborate the version of the facts advanced by the
  8  6 defendant in the criminal action or the party opposing the
  8  7 peace officer or agency in the civil action.
  8  8    The bill specifies that an agency shall participate in any
  8  9 existing state or federal programs that fund or supplement
  8 10 the costs to purchase and maintain body cameras worn by peace
  8 11 officers.
  8 12    The bill may include a state mandate as defined in Code
  8 13 section 25B.3.  The bill makes inapplicable Code section 25B.2,
  8 14 subsection 3, which would relieve a political subdivision from
  8 15 complying with a state mandate if funding for the cost of
  8 16 the state mandate is not provided or specified.  Therefore,
  8 17 political subdivisions are required to comply with any state
  8 18 mandate included in the bill.

  7 20    The bill provides that a person, who is not a part of the
  7 21 content of a recording created by a body camera, may request a
  7 22 copy of and receive such recording if each person who is part
  7 23 of the content of the recording consents in writing.
  7 24    Prior to deleting or disposing of the contents of a recording
  7 25 created by a body camera, the bill requires the person who has
  7 26 the responsibility of deleting or disposing of such a recording
  7 27 on behalf of the agency, to review all applicable and available
  7 28 records, files, and databases to ascertain whether any reason
  7 29 exists that the recording should not be disposed of or deleted.
  7 30    A peace officer who fails to record any interaction with
  7 31 a person or who fails to stop recording such interaction
  7 32 as required by the bill commits a violation. For a first
  7 33 violation of the bill a peace officer shall be given a written
  7 34 reprimand.  For a second or subsequent violation of the bill
  7 35 the peace officer shall be suspended until an investigation
  8  1 into the cause of the violation has been completed.
  8  2    The bill also provides that if an agency is unable to produce
  8  3 a body camera recording during a criminal prosecution or civil
  8  4 action, a rebuttable presumption arises that the recording
  8  5 would corroborate the version of the facts advanced by the
  8  6 defendant in the criminal action or the party opposing the
  8  7 peace officer or agency in the civil action.
  8  8    The bill specifies that an agency shall participate in any
  8  9 existing state or federal programs that fund or supplement
  8 10 the costs to purchase and maintain body cameras worn by peace
  8 11 officers.
  8 12    The bill may include a state mandate as defined in Code
  8 13 section 25B.3.  The bill makes inapplicable Code section 25B.2,
  8 14 subsection 3, which would relieve a political subdivision from
  8 15 complying with a state mandate if funding for the cost of
  8 16 the state mandate is not provided or specified.  Therefore,
  8 17 political subdivisions are required to comply with any state
  8 18 mandate included in the bill.

  5 12                           EXPLANATION
  5 13 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  5 14 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  5 15    This bill requires certain peace officers, including tribal
  5 16 law enforcement officers, to wear a body camera.
  5 17    The bill defines "agency" to mean a law enforcement agency.
  5 18    The bill defines "body camera" to mean an electronic device
  5 19 that is capable of recording video and audio data or capable of
  5 20 transmitting video and audio data to be recorded remotely, and
  5 21 is worn on the person of a peace officer.
  5 22    The body camera requirement applies to a county sheriff
  5 23 or deputy sheriff, city peace officer, peace officer member
  5 24 of the department of public safety, peace officer at a
  5 25 regents institution, conservation officer, an employee of the
  5 26 department of transportation designated as a peace officer,
  5 27 an employee of an aviation authority designated as a peace
  5 28 officer, and a certified tribal law enforcement officer.
  5 29    The bill requires a peace officer to wear a body camera
  5 30 at all times while on duty and in uniform.  The bill further
  5 31 requires that the peace officer record all interactions with
  5 32 people in the performance of the official duties of the peace
  5 33 officer from the beginning to the end of those interactions.
  5 34    The bill specifies that a body camera must be worn on the
  5 35 chest or at the eye level of the peace officer.
  6  1 The bill prohibits a body camera from containing facial
  6  2 recognition technology unless the use of such technology has
  6  3 been authorized by the court pursuant to an arrest or search
  6  4 warrant.
  6  5    The bill requires a peace officer to inform a person when
  6  6 that person is being recorded by a body camera unless informing
  6  7 the person would be unsafe, impractical, or impossible.
  6  8    If a peace officer who is wearing a body camera enters a
  6  9 residence without a warrant or where no exigent circumstances
  6 10 exist, the bill requires that the peace officer immediately ask
  6 11 whether the resident desires the peace officer to stop the body
  6 12 camera recording while the peace officer is in the residence.
  6 13 If the person responds in the affirmative, the bill requires
  6 14 the peace officer to stop the body camera recording.  The bill
  6 15 also requires the peace officer to record the question and any
  6 16 answer to the question.
  6 17    If a peace officer wearing a body camera interacts with a
  6 18 person reporting a crime, providing information regarding a
  6 19 crime or ongoing investigation, or claiming to be a victim of a
  6 20 crime, the bill requires the peace officer to immediately ask
  6 21 whether the person desires the peace officer to stop the body
  6 22 camera recording of the interaction.  If the person responds in
  6 23 the affirmative, the bill requires the peace officer to stop
  6 24 the body camera recording.  The bill also requires the peace
  6 25 officer to record the question and any answer to the question.
  6 26    The contents of a recording created by a body camera are
  6 27 confidential except as provided for in the bill.
  6 28    The bill requires that an agency shall retain the contents
  6 29 of a recording created by a body camera for 30 days.  However,
  6 30 an agency shall retain the contents of a recording created by
  6 31 a body camera for three years if any of the following apply:
  6 32 the recording depicts an incident involving the use of force;
  6 33 the recording depicts an incident that leads to detention or
  6 34 arrest of a person; the recording is relevant to a formal
  6 35 or informal complaint against a peace officer or agency; or
  7  1 a request has been made to retain the recording.  Under the
  7  2 bill, the contents of the recording may be retained even longer
  7  3 than three years if the contents may be relevant to a criminal
  7  4 prosecution.
  7  5    Any of the following persons may make a request that the
  7  6 contents of a recording created by a body camera be retained
  7  7 for three years: a person who is a part of the content of the
  7  8 recording; a person whose property has been seized or damaged
  7  9 in relation to, or is otherwise involved with, a crime that is
  7 10 related to the recording; a parent or guardian of a person who
  7 11 is part of the content of the recording or whose property was
  7 12 seized, damaged, or involved with a crime that is related to
  7 13 the recording; the attorney for a person who is part of the
  7 14 content of the recording or whose property was seized, damaged,
  7 15 or involved with a crime that is related to the recording; any
  7 16 other person if such person has been given written authority
  7 17 to disclose the contents of the recording by the person who
  7 18 is part of the content of the recording or whose property was
  7 19 seized or damaged.
  7 20    The bill provides that a person, who is not a part of the
  7 21 content of a recording created by a body camera, may request a
  7 22 copy of and receive such recording if each person who is part
  7 23 of the content of the recording consents in writing.
  7 24    Prior to deleting or disposing of the contents of a recording
  7 25 created by a body camera, the bill requires the person who has
  7 26 the responsibility of deleting or disposing of such a recording
  7 27 on behalf of the agency, to review all applicable and available
  7 28 records, files, and databases to ascertain whether any reason
  7 29 exists that the recording should not be disposed of or deleted.
  7 30    A peace officer who fails to record any interaction with
  7 31 a person or who fails to stop recording such interaction
  7 32 as required by the bill commits a violation. For a first
  7 33 violation of the bill a peace officer shall be given a written
  7 34 reprimand.  For a second or subsequent violation of the bill
  7 35 the peace officer shall be suspended until an investigation
  8  1 into the cause of the violation has been completed.
  8  2    The bill also provides that if an agency is unable to produce
  8  3 a body camera recording during a criminal prosecution or civil
  8  4 action, a rebuttable presumption arises that the recording
  8  5 would corroborate the version of the facts advanced by the
  8  6 defendant in the criminal action or the party opposing the
  8  7 peace officer or agency in the civil action.
  8  8    The bill specifies that an agency shall participate in any
  8  9 existing state or federal programs that fund or supplement
  8 10 the costs to purchase and maintain body cameras worn by peace
  8 11 officers.
  8 12    The bill may include a state mandate as defined in Code
  8 13 section 25B.3.  The bill makes inapplicable Code section 25B.2,
  8 14 subsection 3, which would relieve a political subdivision from
  8 15 complying with a state mandate if funding for the cost of
  8 16 the state mandate is not provided or specified.  Therefore,
  8 17 political subdivisions are required to comply with any state
  8 18 mandate included in the bill.

  6 18 person reporting a crime, providing information regarding a
  6 19 crime or ongoing investigation, or claiming to be a victim of a
  6 20 crime, the bill requires the peace officer to immediately ask
  6 21 whether the person desires the peace officer to stop the body
  6 22 camera recording of the interaction.  If the person responds in
  6 23 the affirmative, the bill requires the peace officer to stop
  6 24 the body camera recording.  The bill also requires the peace
  6 25 officer to record the question and any answer to the question.
  6 26    The contents of a recording created by a body camera are
  6 27 confidential except as provided for in the bill.
  6 28    The bill requires that an agency shall retain the contents
  6 29 of a recording created by a body camera for 30 days.  However,
  6 30 an agency shall retain the contents of a recording created by
  6 31 a body camera for three years if any of the following apply:
  6 32 the recording depicts an incident involving the use of force;
  6 33 the recording depicts an incident that leads to detention or
  6 34 arrest of a person; the recording is relevant to a formal
  6 35 or informal complaint against a peace officer or agency; or
  7  1 a request has been made to retain the recording.  Under the
  7  2 bill, the contents of the recording may be retained even longer
  7  3 than three years if the contents may be relevant to a criminal
  7  4 prosecution.
  7  5    Any of the following persons may make a request that the
  7  6 contents of a recording created by a body camera be retained
  7  7 for three years: a person who is a part of the content of the
  7  8 recording; a person whose property has been seized or damaged
  7  9 in relation to, or is otherwise involved with, a crime that is
  7 10 related to the recording; a parent or guardian of a person who
  7 11 is part of the content of the recording or whose property was
  7 12 seized, damaged, or involved with a crime that is related to
  7 13 the recording; the attorney for a person who is part of the
  7 14 content of the recording or whose property was seized, damaged,
  7 15 or involved with a crime that is related to the recording; any
  7 16 other person if such person has been given written authority
  7 17 to disclose the contents of the recording by the person who
  7 18 is part of the content of the recording or whose property was
  7 19 seized or damaged.
  7 20    The bill provides that a person, who is not a part of the
  7 21 content of a recording created by a body camera, may request a
  7 22 copy of and receive such recording if each person who is part
  7 23 of the content of the recording consents in writing.
  7 24    Prior to deleting or disposing of the contents of a recording
  7 25 created by a body camera, the bill requires the person who has
  7 26 the responsibility of deleting or disposing of such a recording
  7 27 on behalf of the agency, to review all applicable and available
  7 28 records, files, and databases to ascertain whether any reason
  7 29 exists that the recording should not be disposed of or deleted.
  7 30    A peace officer who fails to record any interaction with
  7 31 a person or who fails to stop recording such interaction
  7 32 as required by the bill commits a violation. For a first
  7 33 violation of the bill a peace officer shall be given a written
  7 34 reprimand.  For a second or subsequent violation of the bill
  7 35 the peace officer shall be suspended until an investigation
  8  1 into the cause of the violation has been completed.
  8  2    The bill also provides that if an agency is unable to produce
  8  3 a body camera recording during a criminal prosecution or civil
  8  4 action, a rebuttable presumption arises that the recording
  8  5 would corroborate the version of the facts advanced by the
  8  6 defendant in the criminal action or the party opposing the
  8  7 peace officer or agency in the civil action.
  8  8    The bill specifies that an agency shall participate in any
  8  9 existing state or federal programs that fund or supplement
  8 10 the costs to purchase and maintain body cameras worn by peace
  8 11 officers.
  8 12    The bill may include a state mandate as defined in Code
  8 13 section 25B.3.  The bill makes inapplicable Code section 25B.2,
  8 14 subsection 3, which would relieve a political subdivision from
  8 15 complying with a state mandate if funding for the cost of
  8 16 the state mandate is not provided or specified.  Therefore,
  8 17 political subdivisions are required to comply with any state
  8 18 mandate included in the bill.

  2 19 recording while the peace officer is in the residence. If the
  2 20 resident responds in the affirmative, the peace officer shall

  5 12                           EXPLANATION
  5 13 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  5 14 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  5 15    This bill requires certain peace officers, including tribal
  5 16 law enforcement officers, to wear a body camera.
  5 17    The bill defines "agency" to mean a law enforcement agency.
  5 18    The bill defines "body camera" to mean an electronic device
  5 19 that is capable of recording video and audio data or capable of
  5 20 transmitting video and audio data to be recorded remotely, and
  5 21 is worn on the person of a peace officer.
  5 22    The body camera requirement applies to a county sheriff
  5 23 or deputy sheriff, city peace officer, peace officer member
  5 24 of the department of public safety, peace officer at a
  5 25 regents institution, conservation officer, an employee of the
  5 26 department of transportation designated as a peace officer,
  5 27 an employee of an aviation authority designated as a peace
  5 28 officer, and a certified tribal law enforcement officer.
  5 29    The bill requires a peace officer to wear a body camera
  5 30 at all times while on duty and in uniform.  The bill further
  5 31 requires that the peace officer record all interactions with
  5 32 people in the performance of the official duties of the peace
  5 33 officer from the beginning to the end of those interactions.
  5 34    The bill specifies that a body camera must be worn on the
  5 35 chest or at the eye level of the peace officer.
  6  1 The bill prohibits a body camera from containing facial
  6  2 recognition technology unless the use of such technology has
  6  3 been authorized by the court pursuant to an arrest or search
  6  4 warrant.
  6  5    The bill requires a peace officer to inform a person when
  6  6 that person is being recorded by a body camera unless informing
  6  7 the person would be unsafe, impractical, or impossible.
  6  8    If a peace officer who is wearing a body camera enters a
  6  9 residence without a warrant or where no exigent circumstances
  6 10 exist, the bill requires that the peace officer immediately ask
  6 11 whether the resident desires the peace officer to stop the body
  6 12 camera recording while the peace officer is in the residence.
  6 13 If the person responds in the affirmative, the bill requires
  6 14 the peace officer to stop the body camera recording.  The bill
  6 15 also requires the peace officer to record the question and any
  6 16 answer to the question.
  6 17    If a peace officer wearing a body camera interacts with a
  6 18 person reporting a crime, providing information regarding a
  6 19 crime or ongoing investigation, or claiming to be a victim of a
  6 20 crime, the bill requires the peace officer to immediately ask
  6 21 whether the person desires the peace officer to stop the body
  6 22 camera recording of the interaction.  If the person responds in
  6 23 the affirmative, the bill requires the peace officer to stop
  6 24 the body camera recording.  The bill also requires the peace
  6 25 officer to record the question and any answer to the question.
  6 26    The contents of a recording created by a body camera are
  6 27 confidential except as provided for in the bill.
  6 28    The bill requires that an agency shall retain the contents
  6 29 of a recording created by a body camera for 30 days.  However,
  6 30 an agency shall retain the contents of a recording created by
  6 31 a body camera for three years if any of the following apply:
  6 32 the recording depicts an incident involving the use of force;
  6 33 the recording depicts an incident that leads to detention or
  6 34 arrest of a person; the recording is relevant to a formal
  6 35 or informal complaint against a peace officer or agency; or
  7  1 a request has been made to retain the recording.  Under the
  7  2 bill, the contents of the recording may be retained even longer
  7  3 than three years if the contents may be relevant to a criminal
  7  4 prosecution.
  7  5    Any of the following persons may make a request that the
  7  6 contents of a recording created by a body camera be retained
  7  7 for three years: a person who is a part of the content of the
  7  8 recording; a person whose property has been seized or damaged
  7  9 in relation to, or is otherwise involved with, a crime that is
  7 10 related to the recording; a parent or guardian of a person who
  7 11 is part of the content of the recording or whose property was
  7 12 seized, damaged, or involved with a crime that is related to
  7 13 the recording; the attorney for a person who is part of the
  7 14 content of the recording or whose property was seized, damaged,

  7 17 to disclose the contents of the recording by the person who
  7 18 is part of the content of the recording or whose property was

  7 20    The bill provides that a person, who is not a part of the
  7 21 content of a recording created by a body camera, may request a
  7 22 copy of and receive such recording if each person who is part
  7 23 of the content of the recording consents in writing.
  7 24    Prior to deleting or disposing of the contents of a recording
  7 25 created by a body camera, the bill requires the person who has
  7 26 the responsibility of deleting or disposing of such a recording
  7 27 on behalf of the agency, to review all applicable and available
  7 28 records, files, and databases to ascertain whether any reason
  7 29 exists that the recording should not be disposed of or deleted.
  7 30    A peace officer who fails to record any interaction with
  7 31 a person or who fails to stop recording such interaction
  7 32 as required by the bill commits a violation. For a first
  7 33 violation of the bill a peace officer shall be given a written
  7 34 reprimand.  For a second or subsequent violation of the bill
  7 35 the peace officer shall be suspended until an investigation
  8  1 into the cause of the violation has been completed.
  8  2    The bill also provides that if an agency is unable to produce
  8  3 a body camera recording during a criminal prosecution or civil
  8  4 action, a rebuttable presumption arises that the recording
  8  5 would corroborate the version of the facts advanced by the
  8  6 defendant in the criminal action or the party opposing the
  8  7 peace officer or agency in the civil action.
  8  8    The bill specifies that an agency shall participate in any
  8  9 existing state or federal programs that fund or supplement
  8 10 the costs to purchase and maintain body cameras worn by peace
  8 11 officers.
  8 12    The bill may include a state mandate as defined in Code
  8 13 section 25B.3.  The bill makes inapplicable Code section 25B.2,
  8 14 subsection 3, which would relieve a political subdivision from
  8 15 complying with a state mandate if funding for the cost of
  8 16 the state mandate is not provided or specified.  Therefore,
  8 17 political subdivisions are required to comply with any state
  8 18 mandate included in the bill.

  5 29    The bill requires a peace officer to wear a body camera
  5 30 at all times while on duty and in uniform.  The bill further

  5 32 people in the performance of the official duties of the peace
  5 33 officer from the beginning to the end of those interactions.
  5 34    The bill specifies that a body camera must be worn on the
  5 35 chest or at the eye level of the peace officer.
  6  1 The bill prohibits a body camera from containing facial
  6  2 recognition technology unless the use of such technology has
  6  3 been authorized by the court pursuant to an arrest or search
  6  4 warrant.
  6  5    The bill requires a peace officer to inform a person when
  6  6 that person is being recorded by a body camera unless informing
  6  7 the person would be unsafe, impractical, or impossible.
  6  8    If a peace officer who is wearing a body camera enters a
  6  9 residence without a warrant or where no exigent circumstances
  6 10 exist, the bill requires that the peace officer immediately ask
  6 11 whether the resident desires the peace officer to stop the body
  6 12 camera recording while the peace officer is in the residence.
  6 13 If the person responds in the affirmative, the bill requires
  6 14 the peace officer to stop the body camera recording.  The bill
  6 15 also requires the peace officer to record the question and any
  6 16 answer to the question.

  6 20 crime, the bill requires the peace officer to immediately ask
  6 21 whether the person desires the peace officer to stop the body
  6 22 camera recording of the interaction.  If the person responds in
  6 23 the affirmative, the bill requires the peace officer to stop
  6 24 the body camera recording.  The bill also requires the peace
  6 25 officer to record the question and any answer to the question.

  6 27 confidential except as provided for in the bill.
  6 28    The bill requires that an agency shall retain the contents
  6 29 of a recording created by a body camera for 30 days.  However,
  6 30 an agency shall retain the contents of a recording created by
  6 31 a body camera for three years if any of the following apply:
  6 32 the recording depicts an incident involving the use of force;
  6 33 the recording depicts an incident that leads to detention or
  6 34 arrest of a person; the recording is relevant to a formal
  6 35 or informal complaint against a peace officer or agency; or
  7  1 a request has been made to retain the recording.  Under the
  7  2 bill, the contents of the recording may be retained even longer
  7  3 than three years if the contents may be relevant to a criminal
  7  4 prosecution.
  7  5    Any of the following persons may make a request that the
  7  6 contents of a recording created by a body camera be retained
  7  7 for three years: a person who is a part of the content of the
  7  8 recording; a person whose property has been seized or damaged
  7  9 in relation to, or is otherwise involved with, a crime that is
  7 10 related to the recording; a parent or guardian of a person who
  7 11 is part of the content of the recording or whose property was
  7 12 seized, damaged, or involved with a crime that is related to
  7 13 the recording; the attorney for a person who is part of the
  7 14 content of the recording or whose property was seized, damaged,
  7 15 or involved with a crime that is related to the recording; any
  7 16 other person if such person has been given written authority
  7 17 to disclose the contents of the recording by the person who
  7 18 is part of the content of the recording or whose property was
  7 19 seized or damaged.
  7 20    The bill provides that a person, who is not a part of the
  7 21 content of a recording created by a body camera, may request a
  7 22 copy of and receive such recording if each person who is part
  7 23 of the content of the recording consents in writing.
  7 24    Prior to deleting or disposing of the contents of a recording
  7 25 created by a body camera, the bill requires the person who has
  7 26 the responsibility of deleting or disposing of such a recording
  7 27 on behalf of the agency, to review all applicable and available
  7 28 records, files, and databases to ascertain whether any reason
  7 29 exists that the recording should not be disposed of or deleted.
  7 30    A peace officer who fails to record any interaction with
  7 31 a person or who fails to stop recording such interaction
  7 32 as required by the bill commits a violation. For a first
  7 33 violation of the bill a peace officer shall be given a written
  7 34 reprimand.  For a second or subsequent violation of the bill
  7 35 the peace officer shall be suspended until an investigation
  8  1 into the cause of the violation has been completed.
  8  2    The bill also provides that if an agency is unable to produce
  8  3 a body camera recording during a criminal prosecution or civil
  8  4 action, a rebuttable presumption arises that the recording
  8  5 would corroborate the version of the facts advanced by the
  8  6 defendant in the criminal action or the party opposing the
  8  7 peace officer or agency in the civil action.
  8  8    The bill specifies that an agency shall participate in any
  8  9 existing state or federal programs that fund or supplement
  8 10 the costs to purchase and maintain body cameras worn by peace
  8 11 officers.
  8 12    The bill may include a state mandate as defined in Code
  8 13 section 25B.3.  The bill makes inapplicable Code section 25B.2,
  8 14 subsection 3, which would relieve a political subdivision from
  8 15 complying with a state mandate if funding for the cost of
  8 16 the state mandate is not provided or specified.  Therefore,
  8 17 political subdivisions are required to comply with any state
  8 18 mandate included in the bill.

  5 12                           EXPLANATION
  5 13 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  5 14 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  5 15    This bill requires certain peace officers, including tribal
  5 16 law enforcement officers, to wear a body camera.
  5 17    The bill defines "agency" to mean a law enforcement agency.
  5 18    The bill defines "body camera" to mean an electronic device
  5 19 that is capable of recording video and audio data or capable of
  5 20 transmitting video and audio data to be recorded remotely, and
  5 21 is worn on the person of a peace officer.
  5 22    The body camera requirement applies to a county sheriff
  5 23 or deputy sheriff, city peace officer, peace officer member
  5 24 of the department of public safety, peace officer at a
  5 25 regents institution, conservation officer, an employee of the
  5 26 department of transportation designated as a peace officer,
  5 27 an employee of an aviation authority designated as a peace
  5 28 officer, and a certified tribal law enforcement officer.
  5 29    The bill requires a peace officer to wear a body camera
  5 30 at all times while on duty and in uniform.  The bill further
  5 31 requires that the peace officer record all interactions with
  5 32 people in the performance of the official duties of the peace
  5 33 officer from the beginning to the end of those interactions.
  5 34    The bill specifies that a body camera must be worn on the
  5 35 chest or at the eye level of the peace officer.
  6  1 The bill prohibits a body camera from containing facial
  6  2 recognition technology unless the use of such technology has
  6  3 been authorized by the court pursuant to an arrest or search
  6  4 warrant.
  6  5    The bill requires a peace officer to inform a person when
  6  6 that person is being recorded by a body camera unless informing
  6  7 the person would be unsafe, impractical, or impossible.
  6  8    If a peace officer who is wearing a body camera enters a
  6  9 residence without a warrant or where no exigent circumstances
  6 10 exist, the bill requires that the peace officer immediately ask
  6 11 whether the resident desires the peace officer to stop the body
  6 12 camera recording while the peace officer is in the residence.
  6 13 If the person responds in the affirmative, the bill requires
  6 14 the peace officer to stop the body camera recording.  The bill
  6 15 also requires the peace officer to record the question and any
  6 16 answer to the question.
  6 17    If a peace officer wearing a body camera interacts with a
  6 18 person reporting a crime, providing information regarding a
  6 19 crime or ongoing investigation, or claiming to be a victim of a
  6 20 crime, the bill requires the peace officer to immediately ask
  6 21 whether the person desires the peace officer to stop the body
  6 22 camera recording of the interaction.  If the person responds in
  6 23 the affirmative, the bill requires the peace officer to stop
  6 24 the body camera recording.  The bill also requires the peace
  6 25 officer to record the question and any answer to the question.
  6 26    The contents of a recording created by a body camera are
  6 27 confidential except as provided for in the bill.
  6 28    The bill requires that an agency shall retain the contents
  6 29 of a recording created by a body camera for 30 days.  However,
  6 30 an agency shall retain the contents of a recording created by
  6 31 a body camera for three years if any of the following apply:
  6 32 the recording depicts an incident involving the use of force;
  6 33 the recording depicts an incident that leads to detention or
  6 34 arrest of a person; the recording is relevant to a formal
  6 35 or informal complaint against a peace officer or agency; or
  7  1 a request has been made to retain the recording.  Under the
  7  2 bill, the contents of the recording may be retained even longer
  7  3 than three years if the contents may be relevant to a criminal
  7  4 prosecution.
  7  5    Any of the following persons may make a request that the
  7  6 contents of a recording created by a body camera be retained
  7  7 for three years: a person who is a part of the content of the
  7  8 recording; a person whose property has been seized or damaged
  7  9 in relation to, or is otherwise involved with, a crime that is
  7 10 related to the recording; a parent or guardian of a person who
  7 11 is part of the content of the recording or whose property was
  7 12 seized, damaged, or involved with a crime that is related to
  7 13 the recording; the attorney for a person who is part of the
  7 14 content of the recording or whose property was seized, damaged,
  7 15 or involved with a crime that is related to the recording; any
  7 16 other person if such person has been given written authority
  7 17 to disclose the contents of the recording by the person who
  7 18 is part of the content of the recording or whose property was
  7 19 seized or damaged.
  7 20    The bill provides that a person, who is not a part of the
  7 21 content of a recording created by a body camera, may request a
  7 22 copy of and receive such recording if each person who is part
  7 23 of the content of the recording consents in writing.
  7 24    Prior to deleting or disposing of the contents of a recording
  7 25 created by a body camera, the bill requires the person who has
  7 26 the responsibility of deleting or disposing of such a recording
  7 27 on behalf of the agency, to review all applicable and available
  7 28 records, files, and databases to ascertain whether any reason
  7 29 exists that the recording should not be disposed of or deleted.
  7 30    A peace officer who fails to record any interaction with
  7 31 a person or who fails to stop recording such interaction
  7 32 as required by the bill commits a violation. For a first
  7 33 violation of the bill a peace officer shall be given a written
  7 34 reprimand.  For a second or subsequent violation of the bill
  7 35 the peace officer shall be suspended until an investigation
  8  1 into the cause of the violation has been completed.
  8  2    The bill also provides that if an agency is unable to produce
  8  3 a body camera recording during a criminal prosecution or civil
  8  4 action, a rebuttable presumption arises that the recording
  8  5 would corroborate the version of the facts advanced by the
  8  6 defendant in the criminal action or the party opposing the
  8  7 peace officer or agency in the civil action.
  8  8    The bill specifies that an agency shall participate in any
  8  9 existing state or federal programs that fund or supplement
  8 10 the costs to purchase and maintain body cameras worn by peace
  8 11 officers.
  8 12    The bill may include a state mandate as defined in Code
  8 13 section 25B.3.  The bill makes inapplicable Code section 25B.2,
  8 14 subsection 3, which would relieve a political subdivision from
  8 15 complying with a state mandate if funding for the cost of
  8 16 the state mandate is not provided or specified.  Therefore,
  8 17 political subdivisions are required to comply with any state
  8 18 mandate included in the bill.

  5 12                           EXPLANATION
  5 13 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  5 14 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  5 15    This bill requires certain peace officers, including tribal
  5 16 law enforcement officers, to wear a body camera.
  5 17    The bill defines "agency" to mean a law enforcement agency.
  5 18    The bill defines "body camera" to mean an electronic device
  5 19 that is capable of recording video and audio data or capable of
  5 20 transmitting video and audio data to be recorded remotely, and
  5 21 is worn on the person of a peace officer.
  5 22    The body camera requirement applies to a county sheriff
  5 23 or deputy sheriff, city peace officer, peace officer member
  5 24 of the department of public safety, peace officer at a
  5 25 regents institution, conservation officer, an employee of the
  5 26 department of transportation designated as a peace officer,
  5 27 an employee of an aviation authority designated as a peace
  5 28 officer, and a certified tribal law enforcement officer.
  5 29    The bill requires a peace officer to wear a body camera
  5 30 at all times while on duty and in uniform.  The bill further
  5 31 requires that the peace officer record all interactions with
  5 32 people in the performance of the official duties of the peace
  5 33 officer from the beginning to the end of those interactions.
  5 34    The bill specifies that a body camera must be worn on the
  5 35 chest or at the eye level of the peace officer.
  6  1 The bill prohibits a body camera from containing facial
  6  2 recognition technology unless the use of such technology has
  6  3 been authorized by the court pursuant to an arrest or search
  6  4 warrant.
  6  5    The bill requires a peace officer to inform a person when
  6  6 that person is being recorded by a body camera unless informing
  6  7 the person would be unsafe, impractical, or impossible.
  6  8    If a peace officer who is wearing a body camera enters a
  6  9 residence without a warrant or where no exigent circumstances
  6 10 exist, the bill requires that the peace officer immediately ask
  6 11 whether the resident desires the peace officer to stop the body
  6 12 camera recording while the peace officer is in the residence.
  6 13 If the person responds in the affirmative, the bill requires
  6 14 the peace officer to stop the body camera recording.  The bill
  6 15 also requires the peace officer to record the question and any
  6 16 answer to the question.
  6 17    If a peace officer wearing a body camera interacts with a
  6 18 person reporting a crime, providing information regarding a
  6 19 crime or ongoing investigation, or claiming to be a victim of a
  6 20 crime, the bill requires the peace officer to immediately ask
  6 21 whether the person desires the peace officer to stop the body
  6 22 camera recording of the interaction.  If the person responds in
  6 23 the affirmative, the bill requires the peace officer to stop
  6 24 the body camera recording.  The bill also requires the peace
  6 25 officer to record the question and any answer to the question.
  6 26    The contents of a recording created by a body camera are
  6 27 confidential except as provided for in the bill.
  6 28    The bill requires that an agency shall retain the contents
  6 29 of a recording created by a body camera for 30 days.  However,
  6 30 an agency shall retain the contents of a recording created by
  6 31 a body camera for three years if any of the following apply:
  6 32 the recording depicts an incident involving the use of force;
  6 33 the recording depicts an incident that leads to detention or
  6 34 arrest of a person; the recording is relevant to a formal
  6 35 or informal complaint against a peace officer or agency; or
  7  1 a request has been made to retain the recording.  Under the
  7  2 bill, the contents of the recording may be retained even longer
  7  3 than three years if the contents may be relevant to a criminal
  7  4 prosecution.
  7  5    Any of the following persons may make a request that the
  7  6 contents of a recording created by a body camera be retained
  7  7 for three years: a person who is a part of the content of the
  7  8 recording; a person whose property has been seized or damaged
  7  9 in relation to, or is otherwise involved with, a crime that is
  7 10 related to the recording; a parent or guardian of a person who
  7 11 is part of the content of the recording or whose property was
  7 12 seized, damaged, or involved with a crime that is related to
  7 13 the recording; the attorney for a person who is part of the
  7 14 content of the recording or whose property was seized, damaged,
  7 15 or involved with a crime that is related to the recording; any
  7 16 other person if such person has been given written authority
  7 17 to disclose the contents of the recording by the person who
  7 18 is part of the content of the recording or whose property was
  7 19 seized or damaged.
  7 20    The bill provides that a person, who is not a part of the
  7 21 content of a recording created by a body camera, may request a
  7 22 copy of and receive such recording if each person who is part
  7 23 of the content of the recording consents in writing.
  7 24    Prior to deleting or disposing of the contents of a recording
  7 25 created by a body camera, the bill requires the person who has
  7 26 the responsibility of deleting or disposing of such a recording
  7 27 on behalf of the agency, to review all applicable and available
  7 28 records, files, and databases to ascertain whether any reason
  7 29 exists that the recording should not be disposed of or deleted.
  7 30    A peace officer who fails to record any interaction with
  7 31 a person or who fails to stop recording such interaction
  7 32 as required by the bill commits a violation. For a first
  7 33 violation of the bill a peace officer shall be given a written
  7 34 reprimand.  For a second or subsequent violation of the bill
  7 35 the peace officer shall be suspended until an investigation
  8  1 into the cause of the violation has been completed.
  8  2    The bill also provides that if an agency is unable to produce
  8  3 a body camera recording during a criminal prosecution or civil
  8  4 action, a rebuttable presumption arises that the recording
  8  5 would corroborate the version of the facts advanced by the
  8  6 defendant in the criminal action or the party opposing the
  8  7 peace officer or agency in the civil action.
  8  8    The bill specifies that an agency shall participate in any
  8  9 existing state or federal programs that fund or supplement
  8 10 the costs to purchase and maintain body cameras worn by peace
  8 11 officers.
  8 12    The bill may include a state mandate as defined in Code
  8 13 section 25B.3.  The bill makes inapplicable Code section 25B.2,
  8 14 subsection 3, which would relieve a political subdivision from
  8 15 complying with a state mandate if funding for the cost of
  8 16 the state mandate is not provided or specified.  Therefore,
  8 17 political subdivisions are required to comply with any state
  8 18 mandate included in the bill.

  5 12                           EXPLANATION
  5 13 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  5 14 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  5 15    This bill requires certain peace officers, including tribal
  5 16 law enforcement officers, to wear a body camera.
  5 17    The bill defines "agency" to mean a law enforcement agency.
  5 18    The bill defines "body camera" to mean an electronic device
  5 19 that is capable of recording video and audio data or capable of
  5 20 transmitting video and audio data to be recorded remotely, and
  5 21 is worn on the person of a peace officer.
  5 22    The body camera requirement applies to a county sheriff
  5 23 or deputy sheriff, city peace officer, peace officer member
  5 24 of the department of public safety, peace officer at a
  5 25 regents institution, conservation officer, an employee of the
  5 26 department of transportation designated as a peace officer,
  5 27 an employee of an aviation authority designated as a peace
  5 28 officer, and a certified tribal law enforcement officer.
  5 29    The bill requires a peace officer to wear a body camera
  5 30 at all times while on duty and in uniform.  The bill further
  5 31 requires that the peace officer record all interactions with
  5 32 people in the performance of the official duties of the peace
  5 33 officer from the beginning to the end of those interactions.
  5 34    The bill specifies that a body camera must be worn on the
  5 35 chest or at the eye level of the peace officer.
  6  1 The bill prohibits a body camera from containing facial
  6  2 recognition technology unless the use of such technology has
  6  3 been authorized by the court pursuant to an arrest or search
  6  4 warrant.
  6  5    The bill requires a peace officer to inform a person when
  6  6 that person is being recorded by a body camera unless informing
  6  7 the person would be unsafe, impractical, or impossible.
  6  8    If a peace officer who is wearing a body camera enters a
  6  9 residence without a warrant or where no exigent circumstances
  6 10 exist, the bill requires that the peace officer immediately ask
  6 11 whether the resident desires the peace officer to stop the body
  6 12 camera recording while the peace officer is in the residence.
  6 13 If the person responds in the affirmative, the bill requires
  6 14 the peace officer to stop the body camera recording.  The bill
  6 15 also requires the peace officer to record the question and any
  6 16 answer to the question.
  6 17    If a peace officer wearing a body camera interacts with a
  6 18 person reporting a crime, providing information regarding a
  6 19 crime or ongoing investigation, or claiming to be a victim of a
  6 20 crime, the bill requires the peace officer to immediately ask
  6 21 whether the person desires the peace officer to stop the body
  6 22 camera recording of the interaction.  If the person responds in
  6 23 the affirmative, the bill requires the peace officer to stop
  6 24 the body camera recording.  The bill also requires the peace
  6 25 officer to record the question and any answer to the question.
  6 26    The contents of a recording created by a body camera are
  6 27 confidential except as provided for in the bill.
  6 28    The bill requires that an agency shall retain the contents
  6 29 of a recording created by a body camera for 30 days.  However,
  6 30 an agency shall retain the contents of a recording created by
  6 31 a body camera for three years if any of the following apply:
  6 32 the recording depicts an incident involving the use of force;
  6 33 the recording depicts an incident that leads to detention or
  6 34 arrest of a person; the recording is relevant to a formal
  6 35 or informal complaint against a peace officer or agency; or
  7  1 a request has been made to retain the recording.  Under the
  7  2 bill, the contents of the recording may be retained even longer
  7  3 than three years if the contents may be relevant to a criminal
  7  4 prosecution.
  7  5    Any of the following persons may make a request that the
  7  6 contents of a recording created by a body camera be retained
  7  7 for three years: a person who is a part of the content of the
  7  8 recording; a person whose property has been seized or damaged
  7  9 in relation to, or is otherwise involved with, a crime that is
  7 10 related to the recording; a parent or guardian of a person who
  7 11 is part of the content of the recording or whose property was
  7 12 seized, damaged, or involved with a crime that is related to
  7 13 the recording; the attorney for a person who is part of the
  7 14 content of the recording or whose property was seized, damaged,
  7 15 or involved with a crime that is related to the recording; any
  7 16 other person if such person has been given written authority
  7 17 to disclose the contents of the recording by the person who
  7 18 is part of the content of the recording or whose property was
  7 19 seized or damaged.
  7 20    The bill provides that a person, who is not a part of the
  7 21 content of a recording created by a body camera, may request a
  7 22 copy of and receive such recording if each person who is part
  7 23 of the content of the recording consents in writing.
  7 24    Prior to deleting or disposing of the contents of a recording
  7 25 created by a body camera, the bill requires the person who has
  7 26 the responsibility of deleting or disposing of such a recording
  7 27 on behalf of the agency, to review all applicable and available
  7 28 records, files, and databases to ascertain whether any reason
  7 29 exists that the recording should not be disposed of or deleted.
  7 30    A peace officer who fails to record any interaction with
  7 31 a person or who fails to stop recording such interaction
  7 32 as required by the bill commits a violation. For a first
  7 33 violation of the bill a peace officer shall be given a written
  7 34 reprimand.  For a second or subsequent violation of the bill
  7 35 the peace officer shall be suspended until an investigation
  8  1 into the cause of the violation has been completed.
  8  2    The bill also provides that if an agency is unable to produce
  8  3 a body camera recording during a criminal prosecution or civil
  8  4 action, a rebuttable presumption arises that the recording
  8  5 would corroborate the version of the facts advanced by the
  8  6 defendant in the criminal action or the party opposing the
  8  7 peace officer or agency in the civil action.
  8  8    The bill specifies that an agency shall participate in any
  8  9 existing state or federal programs that fund or supplement
  8 10 the costs to purchase and maintain body cameras worn by peace
  8 11 officers.
  8 12    The bill may include a state mandate as defined in Code
  8 13 section 25B.3.  The bill makes inapplicable Code section 25B.2,
  8 14 subsection 3, which would relieve a political subdivision from
  8 15 complying with a state mandate if funding for the cost of
  8 16 the state mandate is not provided or specified.  Therefore,
  8 17 political subdivisions are required to comply with any state
  8 18 mandate included in the bill.

  5 12                           EXPLANATION
  5 13 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  5 14 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  5 15    This bill requires certain peace officers, including tribal
  5 16 law enforcement officers, to wear a body camera.
  5 17    The bill defines "agency" to mean a law enforcement agency.
  5 18    The bill defines "body camera" to mean an electronic device
  5 19 that is capable of recording video and audio data or capable of
  5 20 transmitting video and audio data to be recorded remotely, and
  5 21 is worn on the person of a peace officer.
  5 22    The body camera requirement applies to a county sheriff
  5 23 or deputy sheriff, city peace officer, peace officer member
  5 24 of the department of public safety, peace officer at a
  5 25 regents institution, conservation officer, an employee of the
  5 26 department of transportation designated as a peace officer,
  5 27 an employee of an aviation authority designated as a peace
  5 28 officer, and a certified tribal law enforcement officer.
  5 29    The bill requires a peace officer to wear a body camera
  5 30 at all times while on duty and in uniform.  The bill further
  5 31 requires that the peace officer record all interactions with
  5 32 people in the performance of the official duties of the peace
  5 33 officer from the beginning to the end of those interactions.
  5 34    The bill specifies that a body camera must be worn on the
  5 35 chest or at the eye level of the peace officer.
  6  1 The bill prohibits a body camera from containing facial
  6  2 recognition technology unless the use of such technology has
  6  3 been authorized by the court pursuant to an arrest or search
  6  4 warrant.
  6  5    The bill requires a peace officer to inform a person when
  6  6 that person is being recorded by a body camera unless informing
  6  7 the person would be unsafe, impractical, or impossible.
  6  8    If a peace officer who is wearing a body camera enters a
  6  9 residence without a warrant or where no exigent circumstances
  6 10 exist, the bill requires that the peace officer immediately ask
  6 11 whether the resident desires the peace officer to stop the body
  6 12 camera recording while the peace officer is in the residence.
  6 13 If the person responds in the affirmative, the bill requires
  6 14 the peace officer to stop the body camera recording.  The bill
  6 15 also requires the peace officer to record the question and any
  6 16 answer to the question.
  6 17    If a peace officer wearing a body camera interacts with a
  6 18 person reporting a crime, providing information regarding a
  6 19 crime or ongoing investigation, or claiming to be a victim of a
  6 20 crime, the bill requires the peace officer to immediately ask
  6 21 whether the person desires the peace officer to stop the body
  6 22 camera recording of the interaction.  If the person responds in
  6 23 the affirmative, the bill requires the peace officer to stop
  6 24 the body camera recording.  The bill also requires the peace
  6 25 officer to record the question and any answer to the question.
  6 26    The contents of a recording created by a body camera are
  6 27 confidential except as provided for in the bill.
  6 28    The bill requires that an agency shall retain the contents
  6 29 of a recording created by a body camera for 30 days.  However,
  6 30 an agency shall retain the contents of a recording created by
  6 31 a body camera for three years if any of the following apply:
  6 32 the recording depicts an incident involving the use of force;
  6 33 the recording depicts an incident that leads to detention or
  6 34 arrest of a person; the recording is relevant to a formal
  6 35 or informal complaint against a peace officer or agency; or
  7  1 a request has been made to retain the recording.  Under the
  7  2 bill, the contents of the recording may be retained even longer
  7  3 than three years if the contents may be relevant to a criminal
  7  4 prosecution.
  7  5    Any of the following persons may make a request that the
  7  6 contents of a recording created by a body camera be retained
  7  7 for three years: a person who is a part of the content of the
  7  8 recording; a person whose property has been seized or damaged
  7  9 in relation to, or is otherwise involved with, a crime that is
  7 10 related to the recording; a parent or guardian of a person who
  7 11 is part of the content of the recording or whose property was
  7 12 seized, damaged, or involved with a crime that is related to
  7 13 the recording; the attorney for a person who is part of the
  7 14 content of the recording or whose property was seized, damaged,
  7 15 or involved with a crime that is related to the recording; any
  7 16 other person if such person has been given written authority
  7 17 to disclose the contents of the recording by the person who
  7 18 is part of the content of the recording or whose property was
  7 19 seized or damaged.
  7 20    The bill provides that a person, who is not a part of the
  7 21 content of a recording created by a body camera, may request a
  7 22 copy of and receive such recording if each person who is part
  7 23 of the content of the recording consents in writing.
  7 24    Prior to deleting or disposing of the contents of a recording
  7 25 created by a body camera, the bill requires the person who has
  7 26 the responsibility of deleting or disposing of such a recording
  7 27 on behalf of the agency, to review all applicable and available
  7 28 records, files, and databases to ascertain whether any reason
  7 29 exists that the recording should not be disposed of or deleted.
  7 30    A peace officer who fails to record any interaction with
  7 31 a person or who fails to stop recording such interaction
  7 32 as required by the bill commits a violation. For a first
  7 33 violation of the bill a peace officer shall be given a written
  7 34 reprimand.  For a second or subsequent violation of the bill
  7 35 the peace officer shall be suspended until an investigation
  8  1 into the cause of the violation has been completed.
  8  2    The bill also provides that if an agency is unable to produce
  8  3 a body camera recording during a criminal prosecution or civil
  8  4 action, a rebuttable presumption arises that the recording
  8  5 would corroborate the version of the facts advanced by the
  8  6 defendant in the criminal action or the party opposing the
  8  7 peace officer or agency in the civil action.
  8  8    The bill specifies that an agency shall participate in any
  8  9 existing state or federal programs that fund or supplement
  8 10 the costs to purchase and maintain body cameras worn by peace
  8 11 officers.
  8 12    The bill may include a state mandate as defined in Code
  8 13 section 25B.3.  The bill makes inapplicable Code section 25B.2,
  8 14 subsection 3, which would relieve a political subdivision from
  8 15 complying with a state mandate if funding for the cost of
  8 16 the state mandate is not provided or specified.  Therefore,
  8 17 political subdivisions are required to comply with any state
  8 18 mandate included in the bill.

  5 12                           EXPLANATION
  5 13 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  5 14 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  5 15    This bill requires certain peace officers, including tribal
  5 16 law enforcement officers, to wear a body camera.
  5 17    The bill defines "agency" to mean a law enforcement agency.
  5 18    The bill defines "body camera" to mean an electronic device
  5 19 that is capable of recording video and audio data or capable of
  5 20 transmitting video and audio data to be recorded remotely, and
  5 21 is worn on the person of a peace officer.
  5 22    The body camera requirement applies to a county sheriff
  5 23 or deputy sheriff, city peace officer, peace officer member
  5 24 of the department of public safety, peace officer at a
  5 25 regents institution, conservation officer, an employee of the
  5 26 department of transportation designated as a peace officer,
  5 27 an employee of an aviation authority designated as a peace
  5 28 officer, and a certified tribal law enforcement officer.
  5 29    The bill requires a peace officer to wear a body camera
  5 30 at all times while on duty and in uniform.  The bill further
  5 31 requires that the peace officer record all interactions with
  5 32 people in the performance of the official duties of the peace
  5 33 officer from the beginning to the end of those interactions.
  5 34    The bill specifies that a body camera must be worn on the
  5 35 chest or at the eye level of the peace officer.
  6  1 The bill prohibits a body camera from containing facial
  6  2 recognition technology unless the use of such technology has
  6  3 been authorized by the court pursuant to an arrest or search
  6  4 warrant.
  6  5    The bill requires a peace officer to inform a person when
  6  6 that person is being recorded by a body camera unless informing
  6  7 the person would be unsafe, impractical, or impossible.
  6  8    If a peace officer who is wearing a body camera enters a
  6  9 residence without a warrant or where no exigent circumstances
  6 10 exist, the bill requires that the peace officer immediately ask
  6 11 whether the resident desires the peace officer to stop the body
  6 12 camera recording while the peace officer is in the residence.
  6 13 If the person responds in the affirmative, the bill requires
  6 14 the peace officer to stop the body camera recording.  The bill
  6 15 also requires the peace officer to record the question and any
  6 16 answer to the question.
  6 17    If a peace officer wearing a body camera interacts with a
  6 18 person reporting a crime, providing information regarding a
  6 19 crime or ongoing investigation, or claiming to be a victim of a
  6 20 crime, the bill requires the peace officer to immediately ask
  6 21 whether the person desires the peace officer to stop the body
  6 22 camera recording of the interaction.  If the person responds in
  6 23 the affirmative, the bill requires the peace officer to stop
  6 24 the body camera recording.  The bill also requires the peace
  6 25 officer to record the question and any answer to the question.
  6 26    The contents of a recording created by a body camera are
  6 27 confidential except as provided for in the bill.
  6 28    The bill requires that an agency shall retain the contents
  6 29 of a recording created by a body camera for 30 days.  However,
  6 30 an agency shall retain the contents of a recording created by
  6 31 a body camera for three years if any of the following apply:
  6 32 the recording depicts an incident involving the use of force;
  6 33 the recording depicts an incident that leads to detention or
  6 34 arrest of a person; the recording is relevant to a formal
  6 35 or informal complaint against a peace officer or agency; or
  7  1 a request has been made to retain the recording.  Under the
  7  2 bill, the contents of the recording may be retained even longer
  7  3 than three years if the contents may be relevant to a criminal
  7  4 prosecution.
  7  5    Any of the following persons may make a request that the
  7  6 contents of a recording created by a body camera be retained
  7  7 for three years: a person who is a part of the content of the
  7  8 recording; a person whose property has been seized or damaged
  7  9 in relation to, or is otherwise involved with, a crime that is
  7 10 related to the recording; a parent or guardian of a person who
  7 11 is part of the content of the recording or whose property was
  7 12 seized, damaged, or involved with a crime that is related to
  7 13 the recording; the attorney for a person who is part of the
  7 14 content of the recording or whose property was seized, damaged,
  7 15 or involved with a crime that is related to the recording; any
  7 16 other person if such person has been given written authority
  7 17 to disclose the contents of the recording by the person who
  7 18 is part of the content of the recording or whose property was
  7 19 seized or damaged.
  7 20    The bill provides that a person, who is not a part of the
  7 21 content of a recording created by a body camera, may request a
  7 22 copy of and receive such recording if each person who is part
  7 23 of the content of the recording consents in writing.
  7 24    Prior to deleting or disposing of the contents of a recording
  7 25 created by a body camera, the bill requires the person who has
  7 26 the responsibility of deleting or disposing of such a recording
  7 27 on behalf of the agency, to review all applicable and available
  7 28 records, files, and databases to ascertain whether any reason
  7 29 exists that the recording should not be disposed of or deleted.
  7 30    A peace officer who fails to record any interaction with
  7 31 a person or who fails to stop recording such interaction
  7 32 as required by the bill commits a violation. For a first
  7 33 violation of the bill a peace officer shall be given a written
  7 34 reprimand.  For a second or subsequent violation of the bill
  7 35 the peace officer shall be suspended until an investigation
  8  1 into the cause of the violation has been completed.
  8  2    The bill also provides that if an agency is unable to produce
  8  3 a body camera recording during a criminal prosecution or civil
  8  4 action, a rebuttable presumption arises that the recording
  8  5 would corroborate the version of the facts advanced by the
  8  6 defendant in the criminal action or the party opposing the
  8  7 peace officer or agency in the civil action.
  8  8    The bill specifies that an agency shall participate in any
  8  9 existing state or federal programs that fund or supplement
  8 10 the costs to purchase and maintain body cameras worn by peace
  8 11 officers.
  8 12    The bill may include a state mandate as defined in Code
  8 13 section 25B.3.  The bill makes inapplicable Code section 25B.2,
  8 14 subsection 3, which would relieve a political subdivision from
  8 15 complying with a state mandate if funding for the cost of
  8 16 the state mandate is not provided or specified.  Therefore,
  8 17 political subdivisions are required to comply with any state
  8 18 mandate included in the bill.

  5 12                           EXPLANATION
  5 13 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  5 14 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  5 15    This bill requires certain peace officers, including tribal
  5 16 law enforcement officers, to wear a body camera.
  5 17    The bill defines "agency" to mean a law enforcement agency.
  5 18    The bill defines "body camera" to mean an electronic device
  5 19 that is capable of recording video and audio data or capable of
  5 20 transmitting video and audio data to be recorded remotely, and
  5 21 is worn on the person of a peace officer.
  5 22    The body camera requirement applies to a county sheriff
  5 23 or deputy sheriff, city peace officer, peace officer member
  5 24 of the department of public safety, peace officer at a
  5 25 regents institution, conservation officer, an employee of the
  5 26 department of transportation designated as a peace officer,
  5 27 an employee of an aviation authority designated as a peace
  5 28 officer, and a certified tribal law enforcement officer.
  5 29    The bill requires a peace officer to wear a body camera
  5 30 at all times while on duty and in uniform.  The bill further
  5 31 requires that the peace officer record all interactions with
  5 32 people in the performance of the official duties of the peace
  5 33 officer from the beginning to the end of those interactions.
  5 34    The bill specifies that a body camera must be worn on the
  5 35 chest or at the eye level of the peace officer.
  6  1 The bill prohibits a body camera from containing facial
  6  2 recognition technology unless the use of such technology has
  6  3 been authorized by the court pursuant to an arrest or search
  6  4 warrant.
  6  5    The bill requires a peace officer to inform a person when
  6  6 that person is being recorded by a body camera unless informing
  6  7 the person would be unsafe, impractical, or impossible.
  6  8    If a peace officer who is wearing a body camera enters a
  6  9 residence without a warrant or where no exigent circumstances
  6 10 exist, the bill requires that the peace officer immediately ask
  6 11 whether the resident desires the peace officer to stop the body
  6 12 camera recording while the peace officer is in the residence.
  6 13 If the person responds in the affirmative, the bill requires
  6 14 the peace officer to stop the body camera recording.  The bill
  6 15 also requires the peace officer to record the question and any
  6 16 answer to the question.
  6 17    If a peace officer wearing a body camera interacts with a
  6 18 person reporting a crime, providing information regarding a
  6 19 crime or ongoing investigation, or claiming to be a victim of a
  6 20 crime, the bill requires the peace officer to immediately ask
  6 21 whether the person desires the peace officer to stop the body
  6 22 camera recording of the interaction.  If the person responds in
  6 23 the affirmative, the bill requires the peace officer to stop
  6 24 the body camera recording.  The bill also requires the peace
  6 25 officer to record the question and any answer to the question.
  6 26    The contents of a recording created by a body camera are
  6 27 confidential except as provided for in the bill.
  6 28    The bill requires that an agency shall retain the contents
  6 29 of a recording created by a body camera for 30 days.  However,
  6 30 an agency shall retain the contents of a recording created by
  6 31 a body camera for three years if any of the following apply:
  6 32 the recording depicts an incident involving the use of force;
  6 33 the recording depicts an incident that leads to detention or
  6 34 arrest of a person; the recording is relevant to a formal
  6 35 or informal complaint against a peace officer or agency; or
  7  1 a request has been made to retain the recording.  Under the
  7  2 bill, the contents of the recording may be retained even longer
  7  3 than three years if the contents may be relevant to a criminal
  7  4 prosecution.
  7  5    Any of the following persons may make a request that the
  7  6 contents of a recording created by a body camera be retained
  7  7 for three years: a person who is a part of the content of the
  7  8 recording; a person whose property has been seized or damaged
  7  9 in relation to, or is otherwise involved with, a crime that is
  7 10 related to the recording; a parent or guardian of a person who
  7 11 is part of the content of the recording or whose property was
  7 12 seized, damaged, or involved with a crime that is related to
  7 13 the recording; the attorney for a person who is part of the
  7 14 content of the recording or whose property was seized, damaged,
  7 15 or involved with a crime that is related to the recording; any
  7 16 other person if such person has been given written authority
  7 17 to disclose the contents of the recording by the person who
  7 18 is part of the content of the recording or whose property was
  7 19 seized or damaged.
  7 20    The bill provides that a person, who is not a part of the
  7 21 content of a recording created by a body camera, may request a
  7 22 copy of and receive such recording if each person who is part
  7 23 of the content of the recording consents in writing.
  7 24    Prior to deleting or disposing of the contents of a recording
  7 25 created by a body camera, the bill requires the person who has
  7 26 the responsibility of deleting or disposing of such a recording
  7 27 on behalf of the agency, to review all applicable and available
  7 28 records, files, and databases to ascertain whether any reason
  7 29 exists that the recording should not be disposed of or deleted.
  7 30    A peace officer who fails to record any interaction with
  7 31 a person or who fails to stop recording such interaction
  7 32 as required by the bill commits a violation. For a first
  7 33 violation of the bill a peace officer shall be given a written
  7 34 reprimand.  For a second or subsequent violation of the bill
  7 35 the peace officer shall be suspended until an investigation
  8  1 into the cause of the violation has been completed.
  8  2    The bill also provides that if an agency is unable to produce
  8  3 a body camera recording during a criminal prosecution or civil
  8  4 action, a rebuttable presumption arises that the recording
  8  5 would corroborate the version of the facts advanced by the
  8  6 defendant in the criminal action or the party opposing the
  8  7 peace officer or agency in the civil action.
  8  8    The bill specifies that an agency shall participate in any
  8  9 existing state or federal programs that fund or supplement
  8 10 the costs to purchase and maintain body cameras worn by peace
  8 11 officers.
  8 12    The bill may include a state mandate as defined in Code
  8 13 section 25B.3.  The bill makes inapplicable Code section 25B.2,
  8 14 subsection 3, which would relieve a political subdivision from
  8 15 complying with a state mandate if funding for the cost of
  8 16 the state mandate is not provided or specified.  Therefore,
  8 17 political subdivisions are required to comply with any state
  8 18 mandate included in the bill.

  8  1 into the cause of the violation has been completed.
  8  2    The bill also provides that if an agency is unable to produce
  8  3 a body camera recording during a criminal prosecution or civil
  8  4 action, a rebuttable presumption arises that the recording
  8  5 would corroborate the version of the facts advanced by the
  8  6 defendant in the criminal action or the party opposing the
  8  7 peace officer or agency in the civil action.
  8  8    The bill specifies that an agency shall participate in any
  8  9 existing state or federal programs that fund or supplement
  8 10 the costs to purchase and maintain body cameras worn by peace
  8 11 officers.
  8 12    The bill may include a state mandate as defined in Code
  8 13 section 25B.3.  The bill makes inapplicable Code section 25B.2,
  8 14 subsection 3, which would relieve a political subdivision from
  8 15 complying with a state mandate if funding for the cost of
  8 16 the state mandate is not provided or specified.  Therefore,
  8 17 political subdivisions are required to comply with any state
  8 18 mandate included in the bill.

  5 12                           EXPLANATION
  5 13 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  5 14 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  5 15    This bill requires certain peace officers, including tribal
  5 16 law enforcement officers, to wear a body camera.
  5 17    The bill defines "agency" to mean a law enforcement agency.
  5 18    The bill defines "body camera" to mean an electronic device
  5 19 that is capable of recording video and audio data or capable of
  5 20 transmitting video and audio data to be recorded remotely, and
  5 21 is worn on the person of a peace officer.
  5 22    The body camera requirement applies to a county sheriff
  5 23 or deputy sheriff, city peace officer, peace officer member
  5 24 of the department of public safety, peace officer at a
  5 25 regents institution, conservation officer, an employee of the
  5 26 department of transportation designated as a peace officer,
  5 27 an employee of an aviation authority designated as a peace
  5 28 officer, and a certified tribal law enforcement officer.
  5 29    The bill requires a peace officer to wear a body camera
  5 30 at all times while on duty and in uniform.  The bill further
  5 31 requires that the peace officer record all interactions with
  5 32 people in the performance of the official duties of the peace
  5 33 officer from the beginning to the end of those interactions.
  5 34    The bill specifies that a body camera must be worn on the
  5 35 chest or at the eye level of the peace officer.
  6  1 The bill prohibits a body camera from containing facial
  6  2 recognition technology unless the use of such technology has
  6  3 been authorized by the court pursuant to an arrest or search
  6  4 warrant.
  6  5    The bill requires a peace officer to inform a person when
  6  6 that person is being recorded by a body camera unless informing
  6  7 the person would be unsafe, impractical, or impossible.
  6  8    If a peace officer who is wearing a body camera enters a
  6  9 residence without a warrant or where no exigent circumstances
  6 10 exist, the bill requires that the peace officer immediately ask
  6 11 whether the resident desires the peace officer to stop the body
  6 12 camera recording while the peace officer is in the residence.
  6 13 If the person responds in the affirmative, the bill requires
  6 14 the peace officer to stop the body camera recording.  The bill
  6 15 also requires the peace officer to record the question and any
  6 16 answer to the question.
  6 17    If a peace officer wearing a body camera interacts with a
  6 18 person reporting a crime, providing information regarding a
  6 19 crime or ongoing investigation, or claiming to be a victim of a
  6 20 crime, the bill requires the peace officer to immediately ask
  6 21 whether the person desires the peace officer to stop the body
  6 22 camera recording of the interaction.  If the person responds in
  6 23 the affirmative, the bill requires the peace officer to stop
  6 24 the body camera recording.  The bill also requires the peace
  6 25 officer to record the question and any answer to the question.
  6 26    The contents of a recording created by a body camera are
  6 27 confidential except as provided for in the bill.
  6 28    The bill requires that an agency shall retain the contents
  6 29 of a recording created by a body camera for 30 days.  However,
  6 30 an agency shall retain the contents of a recording created by
  6 31 a body camera for three years if any of the following apply:
  6 32 the recording depicts an incident involving the use of force;
  6 33 the recording depicts an incident that leads to detention or
  6 34 arrest of a person; the recording is relevant to a formal
  6 35 or informal complaint against a peace officer or agency; or
  7  1 a request has been made to retain the recording.  Under the
  7  2 bill, the contents of the recording may be retained even longer
  7  3 than three years if the contents may be relevant to a criminal
  7  4 prosecution.
  7  5    Any of the following persons may make a request that the
  7  6 contents of a recording created by a body camera be retained
  7  7 for three years: a person who is a part of the content of the
  7  8 recording; a person whose property has been seized or damaged
  7  9 in relation to, or is otherwise involved with, a crime that is
  7 10 related to the recording; a parent or guardian of a person who
  7 11 is part of the content of the recording or whose property was
  7 12 seized, damaged, or involved with a crime that is related to
  7 13 the recording; the attorney for a person who is part of the
  7 14 content of the recording or whose property was seized, damaged,
  7 15 or involved with a crime that is related to the recording; any
  7 16 other person if such person has been given written authority
  7 17 to disclose the contents of the recording by the person who
  7 18 is part of the content of the recording or whose property was
  7 19 seized or damaged.
  7 20    The bill provides that a person, who is not a part of the
  7 21 content of a recording created by a body camera, may request a
  7 22 copy of and receive such recording if each person who is part
  7 23 of the content of the recording consents in writing.
  7 24    Prior to deleting or disposing of the contents of a recording
  7 25 created by a body camera, the bill requires the person who has
  7 26 the responsibility of deleting or disposing of such a recording
  7 27 on behalf of the agency, to review all applicable and available
  7 28 records, files, and databases to ascertain whether any reason
  7 29 exists that the recording should not be disposed of or deleted.
  7 30    A peace officer who fails to record any interaction with
  7 31 a person or who fails to stop recording such interaction
  7 32 as required by the bill commits a violation. For a first
  7 33 violation of the bill a peace officer shall be given a written
  7 34 reprimand.  For a second or subsequent violation of the bill
  7 35 the peace officer shall be suspended until an investigation
  8  1 into the cause of the violation has been completed.
  8  2    The bill also provides that if an agency is unable to produce
  8  3 a body camera recording during a criminal prosecution or civil
  8  4 action, a rebuttable presumption arises that the recording
  8  5 would corroborate the version of the facts advanced by the
  8  6 defendant in the criminal action or the party opposing the
  8  7 peace officer or agency in the civil action.
  8  8    The bill specifies that an agency shall participate in any
  8  9 existing state or federal programs that fund or supplement
  8 10 the costs to purchase and maintain body cameras worn by peace
  8 11 officers.
  8 12    The bill may include a state mandate as defined in Code
  8 13 section 25B.3.  The bill makes inapplicable Code section 25B.2,
  8 14 subsection 3, which would relieve a political subdivision from
  8 15 complying with a state mandate if funding for the cost of
  8 16 the state mandate is not provided or specified.  Therefore,
  8 17 political subdivisions are required to comply with any state
  8 18 mandate included in the bill.

  7 32 as required by the bill commits a violation. For a first
  7 33 violation of the bill a peace officer shall be given a written
  7 34 reprimand.  For a second or subsequent violation of the bill
  7 35 the peace officer shall be suspended until an investigation
  8  1 into the cause of the violation has been completed.
  8  2    The bill also provides that if an agency is unable to produce
  8  3 a body camera recording during a criminal prosecution or civil
  8  4 action, a rebuttable presumption arises that the recording
  8  5 would corroborate the version of the facts advanced by the
  8  6 defendant in the criminal action or the party opposing the
  8  7 peace officer or agency in the civil action.
  8  8    The bill specifies that an agency shall participate in any
  8  9 existing state or federal programs that fund or supplement
  8 10 the costs to purchase and maintain body cameras worn by peace
  8 11 officers.
  8 12    The bill may include a state mandate as defined in Code
  8 13 section 25B.3.  The bill makes inapplicable Code section 25B.2,
  8 14 subsection 3, which would relieve a political subdivision from
  8 15 complying with a state mandate if funding for the cost of
  8 16 the state mandate is not provided or specified.  Therefore,
  8 17 political subdivisions are required to comply with any state
  8 18 mandate included in the bill.

  5 13 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  5 14 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  5 15    This bill requires certain peace officers, including tribal
  5 16 law enforcement officers, to wear a body camera.
  5 17    The bill defines "agency" to mean a law enforcement agency.
  5 18    The bill defines "body camera" to mean an electronic device
  5 19 that is capable of recording video and audio data or capable of
  5 20 transmitting video and audio data to be recorded remotely, and
  5 21 is worn on the person of a peace officer.
  5 22    The body camera requirement applies to a county sheriff
  5 23 or deputy sheriff, city peace officer, peace officer member
  5 24 of the department of public safety, peace officer at a
  5 25 regents institution, conservation officer, an employee of the
  5 26 department of transportation designated as a peace officer,
  5 27 an employee of an aviation authority designated as a peace
  5 28 officer, and a certified tribal law enforcement officer.
  5 29    The bill requires a peace officer to wear a body camera
  5 30 at all times while on duty and in uniform.  The bill further
  5 31 requires that the peace officer record all interactions with
  5 32 people in the performance of the official duties of the peace
  5 33 officer from the beginning to the end of those interactions.
  5 34    The bill specifies that a body camera must be worn on the
  5 35 chest or at the eye level of the peace officer.
  6  1 The bill prohibits a body camera from containing facial
  6  2 recognition technology unless the use of such technology has
  6  3 been authorized by the court pursuant to an arrest or search
  6  4 warrant.
  6  5    The bill requires a peace officer to inform a person when
  6  6 that person is being recorded by a body camera unless informing
  6  7 the person would be unsafe, impractical, or impossible.
  6  8    If a peace officer who is wearing a body camera enters a
  6  9 residence without a warrant or where no exigent circumstances
  6 10 exist, the bill requires that the peace officer immediately ask
  6 11 whether the resident desires the peace officer to stop the body
  6 12 camera recording while the peace officer is in the residence.
  6 13 If the person responds in the affirmative, the bill requires
  6 14 the peace officer to stop the body camera recording.  The bill
  6 15 also requires the peace officer to record the question and any
  6 16 answer to the question.
  6 17    If a peace officer wearing a body camera interacts with a
  6 18 person reporting a crime, providing information regarding a
  6 19 crime or ongoing investigation, or claiming to be a victim of a
  6 20 crime, the bill requires the peace officer to immediately ask
  6 21 whether the person desires the peace officer to stop the body
  6 22 camera recording of the interaction.  If the person responds in
  6 23 the affirmative, the bill requires the peace officer to stop
  6 24 the body camera recording.  The bill also requires the peace
  6 25 officer to record the question and any answer to the question.
  6 26    The contents of a recording created by a body camera are
  6 27 confidential except as provided for in the bill.
  6 28    The bill requires that an agency shall retain the contents
  6 29 of a recording created by a body camera for 30 days.  However,
  6 30 an agency shall retain the contents of a recording created by
  6 31 a body camera for three years if any of the following apply:
  6 32 the recording depicts an incident involving the use of force;
  6 33 the recording depicts an incident that leads to detention or
  6 34 arrest of a person; the recording is relevant to a formal
  6 35 or informal complaint against a peace officer or agency; or
  7  1 a request has been made to retain the recording.  Under the
  7  2 bill, the contents of the recording may be retained even longer
  7  3 than three years if the contents may be relevant to a criminal
  7  4 prosecution.
  7  5    Any of the following persons may make a request that the
  7  6 contents of a recording created by a body camera be retained
  7  7 for three years: a person who is a part of the content of the
  7  8 recording; a person whose property has been seized or damaged
  7  9 in relation to, or is otherwise involved with, a crime that is
  7 10 related to the recording; a parent or guardian of a person who
  7 11 is part of the content of the recording or whose property was
  7 12 seized, damaged, or involved with a crime that is related to
  7 13 the recording; the attorney for a person who is part of the
  7 14 content of the recording or whose property was seized, damaged,
  7 15 or involved with a crime that is related to the recording; any
  7 16 other person if such person has been given written authority
  7 17 to disclose the contents of the recording by the person who
  7 18 is part of the content of the recording or whose property was
  7 19 seized or damaged.
  7 20    The bill provides that a person, who is not a part of the
  7 21 content of a recording created by a body camera, may request a
  7 22 copy of and receive such recording if each person who is part
  7 23 of the content of the recording consents in writing.
  7 24    Prior to deleting or disposing of the contents of a recording
  7 25 created by a body camera, the bill requires the person who has
  7 26 the responsibility of deleting or disposing of such a recording
  7 27 on behalf of the agency, to review all applicable and available
  7 28 records, files, and databases to ascertain whether any reason
  7 29 exists that the recording should not be disposed of or deleted.
  7 30    A peace officer who fails to record any interaction with
  7 31 a person or who fails to stop recording such interaction
  7 32 as required by the bill commits a violation. For a first
  7 33 violation of the bill a peace officer shall be given a written
  7 34 reprimand.  For a second or subsequent violation of the bill
  7 35 the peace officer shall be suspended until an investigation
  8  1 into the cause of the violation has been completed.
  8  2    The bill also provides that if an agency is unable to produce
  8  3 a body camera recording during a criminal prosecution or civil
  8  4 action, a rebuttable presumption arises that the recording
  8  5 would corroborate the version of the facts advanced by the
  8  6 defendant in the criminal action or the party opposing the
  8  7 peace officer or agency in the civil action.

  8  9 existing state or federal programs that fund or supplement
  8 10 the costs to purchase and maintain body cameras worn by peace
  8 11 officers.
  8 12    The bill may include a state mandate as defined in Code

  8 14 subsection 3, which would relieve a political subdivision from

  7 31 a person or who fails to stop recording such interaction
  7 32 as required by the bill commits a violation. For a first
  7 33 violation of the bill a peace officer shall be given a written
  7 34 reprimand.  For a second or subsequent violation of the bill
  7 35 the peace officer shall be suspended until an investigation
  8  1 into the cause of the violation has been completed.
  8  2    The bill also provides that if an agency is unable to produce
  8  3 a body camera recording during a criminal prosecution or civil
  8  4 action, a rebuttable presumption arises that the recording
  8  5 would corroborate the version of the facts advanced by the
  8  6 defendant in the criminal action or the party opposing the
  8  7 peace officer or agency in the civil action.
  8  8    The bill specifies that an agency shall participate in any
  8  9 existing state or federal programs that fund or supplement
  8 10 the costs to purchase and maintain body cameras worn by peace
  8 11 officers.
  8 12    The bill may include a state mandate as defined in Code
  8 13 section 25B.3.  The bill makes inapplicable Code section 25B.2,
  8 14 subsection 3, which would relieve a political subdivision from
  8 15 complying with a state mandate if funding for the cost of
  8 16 the state mandate is not provided or specified.  Therefore,
  8 17 political subdivisions are required to comply with any state
  8 18 mandate included in the bill.

  5 12                           EXPLANATION
  5 13 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  5 14 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  5 15    This bill requires certain peace officers, including tribal
  5 16 law enforcement officers, to wear a body camera.
  5 17    The bill defines "agency" to mean a law enforcement agency.
  5 18    The bill defines "body camera" to mean an electronic device
  5 19 that is capable of recording video and audio data or capable of
  5 20 transmitting video and audio data to be recorded remotely, and
  5 21 is worn on the person of a peace officer.
  5 22    The body camera requirement applies to a county sheriff
  5 23 or deputy sheriff, city peace officer, peace officer member
  5 24 of the department of public safety, peace officer at a
  5 25 regents institution, conservation officer, an employee of the
  5 26 department of transportation designated as a peace officer,
  5 27 an employee of an aviation authority designated as a peace
  5 28 officer, and a certified tribal law enforcement officer.
  5 29    The bill requires a peace officer to wear a body camera
  5 30 at all times while on duty and in uniform.  The bill further
  5 31 requires that the peace officer record all interactions with
  5 32 people in the performance of the official duties of the peace
  5 33 officer from the beginning to the end of those interactions.
  5 34    The bill specifies that a body camera must be worn on the
  5 35 chest or at the eye level of the peace officer.
  6  1 The bill prohibits a body camera from containing facial
  6  2 recognition technology unless the use of such technology has
  6  3 been authorized by the court pursuant to an arrest or search
  6  4 warrant.
  6  5    The bill requires a peace officer to inform a person when
  6  6 that person is being recorded by a body camera unless informing
  6  7 the person would be unsafe, impractical, or impossible.
  6  8    If a peace officer who is wearing a body camera enters a
  6  9 residence without a warrant or where no exigent circumstances
  6 10 exist, the bill requires that the peace officer immediately ask
  6 11 whether the resident desires the peace officer to stop the body
  6 12 camera recording while the peace officer is in the residence.
  6 13 If the person responds in the affirmative, the bill requires
  6 14 the peace officer to stop the body camera recording.  The bill
  6 15 also requires the peace officer to record the question and any
  6 16 answer to the question.
  6 17    If a peace officer wearing a body camera interacts with a
  6 18 person reporting a crime, providing information regarding a
  6 19 crime or ongoing investigation, or claiming to be a victim of a
  6 20 crime, the bill requires the peace officer to immediately ask
  6 21 whether the person desires the peace officer to stop the body
  6 22 camera recording of the interaction.  If the person responds in
  6 23 the affirmative, the bill requires the peace officer to stop
  6 24 the body camera recording.  The bill also requires the peace
  6 25 officer to record the question and any answer to the question.
  6 26    The contents of a recording created by a body camera are
  6 27 confidential except as provided for in the bill.
  6 28    The bill requires that an agency shall retain the contents
  6 29 of a recording created by a body camera for 30 days.  However,
  6 30 an agency shall retain the contents of a recording created by
  6 31 a body camera for three years if any of the following apply:
  6 32 the recording depicts an incident involving the use of force;
  6 33 the recording depicts an incident that leads to detention or
  6 34 arrest of a person; the recording is relevant to a formal
  6 35 or informal complaint against a peace officer or agency; or
  7  1 a request has been made to retain the recording.  Under the
  7  2 bill, the contents of the recording may be retained even longer
  7  3 than three years if the contents may be relevant to a criminal
  7  4 prosecution.
  7  5    Any of the following persons may make a request that the
  7  6 contents of a recording created by a body camera be retained
  7  7 for three years: a person who is a part of the content of the
  7  8 recording; a person whose property has been seized or damaged
  7  9 in relation to, or is otherwise involved with, a crime that is
  7 10 related to the recording; a parent or guardian of a person who
  7 11 is part of the content of the recording or whose property was
  7 12 seized, damaged, or involved with a crime that is related to
  7 13 the recording; the attorney for a person who is part of the
  7 14 content of the recording or whose property was seized, damaged,
  7 15 or involved with a crime that is related to the recording; any
  7 16 other person if such person has been given written authority
  7 17 to disclose the contents of the recording by the person who
  7 18 is part of the content of the recording or whose property was
  7 19 seized or damaged.
  7 20    The bill provides that a person, who is not a part of the
  7 21 content of a recording created by a body camera, may request a
  7 22 copy of and receive such recording if each person who is part
  7 23 of the content of the recording consents in writing.
  7 24    Prior to deleting or disposing of the contents of a recording
  7 25 created by a body camera, the bill requires the person who has
  7 26 the responsibility of deleting or disposing of such a recording
  7 27 on behalf of the agency, to review all applicable and available
  7 28 records, files, and databases to ascertain whether any reason
  7 29 exists that the recording should not be disposed of or deleted.
  7 30    A peace officer who fails to record any interaction with
  7 31 a person or who fails to stop recording such interaction
  7 32 as required by the bill commits a violation. For a first
  7 33 violation of the bill a peace officer shall be given a written
  7 34 reprimand.  For a second or subsequent violation of the bill
  7 35 the peace officer shall be suspended until an investigation
  8  1 into the cause of the violation has been completed.
  8  2    The bill also provides that if an agency is unable to produce
  8  3 a body camera recording during a criminal prosecution or civil
  8  4 action, a rebuttable presumption arises that the recording
  8  5 would corroborate the version of the facts advanced by the
  8  6 defendant in the criminal action or the party opposing the
  8  7 peace officer or agency in the civil action.
  8  8    The bill specifies that an agency shall participate in any
  8  9 existing state or federal programs that fund or supplement
  8 10 the costs to purchase and maintain body cameras worn by peace
  8 11 officers.
  8 12    The bill may include a state mandate as defined in Code
  8 13 section 25B.3.  The bill makes inapplicable Code section 25B.2,
  8 14 subsection 3, which would relieve a political subdivision from
  8 15 complying with a state mandate if funding for the cost of
  8 16 the state mandate is not provided or specified.  Therefore,
  8 17 political subdivisions are required to comply with any state
  8 18 mandate included in the bill.

  7 34 reprimand.  For a second or subsequent violation of the bill
  7 35 the peace officer shall be suspended until an investigation
  8  1 into the cause of the violation has been completed.
  8  2    The bill also provides that if an agency is unable to produce
  8  3 a body camera recording during a criminal prosecution or civil
  8  4 action, a rebuttable presumption arises that the recording
  8  5 would corroborate the version of the facts advanced by the
  8  6 defendant in the criminal action or the party opposing the
  8  7 peace officer or agency in the civil action.
  8  8    The bill specifies that an agency shall participate in any
  8  9 existing state or federal programs that fund or supplement
  8 10 the costs to purchase and maintain body cameras worn by peace
  8 11 officers.
  8 12    The bill may include a state mandate as defined in Code
  8 13 section 25B.3.  The bill makes inapplicable Code section 25B.2,
  8 14 subsection 3, which would relieve a political subdivision from
  8 15 complying with a state mandate if funding for the cost of
  8 16 the state mandate is not provided or specified.  Therefore,
  8 17 political subdivisions are required to comply with any state
  8 18 mandate included in the bill.

  5 12                           EXPLANATION
  5 13 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  5 14 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  5 15    This bill requires certain peace officers, including tribal
  5 16 law enforcement officers, to wear a body camera.
  5 17    The bill defines "agency" to mean a law enforcement agency.
  5 18    The bill defines "body camera" to mean an electronic device
  5 19 that is capable of recording video and audio data or capable of
  5 20 transmitting video and audio data to be recorded remotely, and
  5 21 is worn on the person of a peace officer.
  5 22    The body camera requirement applies to a county sheriff
  5 23 or deputy sheriff, city peace officer, peace officer member
  5 24 of the department of public safety, peace officer at a
  5 25 regents institution, conservation officer, an employee of the
  5 26 department of transportation designated as a peace officer,
  5 27 an employee of an aviation authority designated as a peace
  5 28 officer, and a certified tribal law enforcement officer.
  5 29    The bill requires a peace officer to wear a body camera
  5 30 at all times while on duty and in uniform.  The bill further
  5 31 requires that the peace officer record all interactions with
  5 32 people in the performance of the official duties of the peace
  5 33 officer from the beginning to the end of those interactions.
  5 34    The bill specifies that a body camera must be worn on the
  5 35 chest or at the eye level of the peace officer.
  6  1 The bill prohibits a body camera from containing facial
  6  2 recognition technology unless the use of such technology has
  6  3 been authorized by the court pursuant to an arrest or search
  6  4 warrant.
  6  5    The bill requires a peace officer to inform a person when
  6  6 that person is being recorded by a body camera unless informing
  6  7 the person would be unsafe, impractical, or impossible.
  6  8    If a peace officer who is wearing a body camera enters a
  6  9 residence without a warrant or where no exigent circumstances
  6 10 exist, the bill requires that the peace officer immediately ask
  6 11 whether the resident desires the peace officer to stop the body
  6 12 camera recording while the peace officer is in the residence.
  6 13 If the person responds in the affirmative, the bill requires
  6 14 the peace officer to stop the body camera recording.  The bill
  6 15 also requires the peace officer to record the question and any
  6 16 answer to the question.
  6 17    If a peace officer wearing a body camera interacts with a
  6 18 person reporting a crime, providing information regarding a
  6 19 crime or ongoing investigation, or claiming to be a victim of a
  6 20 crime, the bill requires the peace officer to immediately ask
  6 21 whether the person desires the peace officer to stop the body
  6 22 camera recording of the interaction.  If the person responds in
  6 23 the affirmative, the bill requires the peace officer to stop
  6 24 the body camera recording.  The bill also requires the peace
  6 25 officer to record the question and any answer to the question.
  6 26    The contents of a recording created by a body camera are
  6 27 confidential except as provided for in the bill.
  6 28    The bill requires that an agency shall retain the contents
  6 29 of a recording created by a body camera for 30 days.  However,
  6 30 an agency shall retain the contents of a recording created by
  6 31 a body camera for three years if any of the following apply:
  6 32 the recording depicts an incident involving the use of force;
  6 33 the recording depicts an incident that leads to detention or
  6 34 arrest of a person; the recording is relevant to a formal
  6 35 or informal complaint against a peace officer or agency; or
  7  1 a request has been made to retain the recording.  Under the
  7  2 bill, the contents of the recording may be retained even longer
  7  3 than three years if the contents may be relevant to a criminal
  7  4 prosecution.
  7  5    Any of the following persons may make a request that the
  7  6 contents of a recording created by a body camera be retained
  7  7 for three years: a person who is a part of the content of the
  7  8 recording; a person whose property has been seized or damaged
  7  9 in relation to, or is otherwise involved with, a crime that is
  7 10 related to the recording; a parent or guardian of a person who
  7 11 is part of the content of the recording or whose property was
  7 12 seized, damaged, or involved with a crime that is related to
  7 13 the recording; the attorney for a person who is part of the
  7 14 content of the recording or whose property was seized, damaged,
  7 15 or involved with a crime that is related to the recording; any
  7 16 other person if such person has been given written authority
  7 17 to disclose the contents of the recording by the person who
  7 18 is part of the content of the recording or whose property was
  7 19 seized or damaged.
  7 20    The bill provides that a person, who is not a part of the
  7 21 content of a recording created by a body camera, may request a
  7 22 copy of and receive such recording if each person who is part
  7 23 of the content of the recording consents in writing.
  7 24    Prior to deleting or disposing of the contents of a recording
  7 25 created by a body camera, the bill requires the person who has
  7 26 the responsibility of deleting or disposing of such a recording
  7 27 on behalf of the agency, to review all applicable and available
  7 28 records, files, and databases to ascertain whether any reason
  7 29 exists that the recording should not be disposed of or deleted.
  7 30    A peace officer who fails to record any interaction with
  7 31 a person or who fails to stop recording such interaction
  7 32 as required by the bill commits a violation. For a first
  7 33 violation of the bill a peace officer shall be given a written
  7 34 reprimand.  For a second or subsequent violation of the bill
  7 35 the peace officer shall be suspended until an investigation
  8  1 into the cause of the violation has been completed.
  8  2    The bill also provides that if an agency is unable to produce
  8  3 a body camera recording during a criminal prosecution or civil
  8  4 action, a rebuttable presumption arises that the recording
  8  5 would corroborate the version of the facts advanced by the
  8  6 defendant in the criminal action or the party opposing the
  8  7 peace officer or agency in the civil action.
  8  8    The bill specifies that an agency shall participate in any
  8  9 existing state or federal programs that fund or supplement
  8 10 the costs to purchase and maintain body cameras worn by peace
  8 11 officers.
  8 12    The bill may include a state mandate as defined in Code
  8 13 section 25B.3.  The bill makes inapplicable Code section 25B.2,
  8 14 subsection 3, which would relieve a political subdivision from
  8 15 complying with a state mandate if funding for the cost of
  8 16 the state mandate is not provided or specified.  Therefore,
  8 17 political subdivisions are required to comply with any state
  8 18 mandate included in the bill.

  8  9 existing state or federal programs that fund or supplement
  8 10 the costs to purchase and maintain body cameras worn by peace
  8 11 officers.
  8 12    The bill may include a state mandate as defined in Code
  8 13 section 25B.3.  The bill makes inapplicable Code section 25B.2,
  8 14 subsection 3, which would relieve a political subdivision from
  8 15 complying with a state mandate if funding for the cost of
  8 16 the state mandate is not provided or specified.  Therefore,
  8 17 political subdivisions are required to comply with any state
  8 18 mandate included in the bill.

  5 12                           EXPLANATION
  5 13 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  5 14 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  5 15    This bill requires certain peace officers, including tribal
  5 16 law enforcement officers, to wear a body camera.
  5 17    The bill defines "agency" to mean a law enforcement agency.
  5 18    The bill defines "body camera" to mean an electronic device
  5 19 that is capable of recording video and audio data or capable of
  5 20 transmitting video and audio data to be recorded remotely, and
  5 21 is worn on the person of a peace officer.
  5 22    The body camera requirement applies to a county sheriff
  5 23 or deputy sheriff, city peace officer, peace officer member
  5 24 of the department of public safety, peace officer at a
  5 25 regents institution, conservation officer, an employee of the
  5 26 department of transportation designated as a peace officer,
  5 27 an employee of an aviation authority designated as a peace
  5 28 officer, and a certified tribal law enforcement officer.
  5 29    The bill requires a peace officer to wear a body camera
  5 30 at all times while on duty and in uniform.  The bill further
  5 31 requires that the peace officer record all interactions with
  5 32 people in the performance of the official duties of the peace
  5 33 officer from the beginning to the end of those interactions.
  5 34    The bill specifies that a body camera must be worn on the
  5 35 chest or at the eye level of the peace officer.
  6  1 The bill prohibits a body camera from containing facial
  6  2 recognition technology unless the use of such technology has
  6  3 been authorized by the court pursuant to an arrest or search
  6  4 warrant.
  6  5    The bill requires a peace officer to inform a person when
  6  6 that person is being recorded by a body camera unless informing
  6  7 the person would be unsafe, impractical, or impossible.
  6  8    If a peace officer who is wearing a body camera enters a
  6  9 residence without a warrant or where no exigent circumstances
  6 10 exist, the bill requires that the peace officer immediately ask
  6 11 whether the resident desires the peace officer to stop the body
  6 12 camera recording while the peace officer is in the residence.
  6 13 If the person responds in the affirmative, the bill requires
  6 14 the peace officer to stop the body camera recording.  The bill
  6 15 also requires the peace officer to record the question and any
  6 16 answer to the question.
  6 17    If a peace officer wearing a body camera interacts with a
  6 18 person reporting a crime, providing information regarding a
  6 19 crime or ongoing investigation, or claiming to be a victim of a
  6 20 crime, the bill requires the peace officer to immediately ask
  6 21 whether the person desires the peace officer to stop the body
  6 22 camera recording of the interaction.  If the person responds in
  6 23 the affirmative, the bill requires the peace officer to stop
  6 24 the body camera recording.  The bill also requires the peace
  6 25 officer to record the question and any answer to the question.
  6 26    The contents of a recording created by a body camera are
  6 27 confidential except as provided for in the bill.
  6 28    The bill requires that an agency shall retain the contents
  6 29 of a recording created by a body camera for 30 days.  However,
  6 30 an agency shall retain the contents of a recording created by
  6 31 a body camera for three years if any of the following apply:
  6 32 the recording depicts an incident involving the use of force;
  6 33 the recording depicts an incident that leads to detention or
  6 34 arrest of a person; the recording is relevant to a formal
  6 35 or informal complaint against a peace officer or agency; or
  7  1 a request has been made to retain the recording.  Under the
  7  2 bill, the contents of the recording may be retained even longer
  7  3 than three years if the contents may be relevant to a criminal
  7  4 prosecution.
  7  5    Any of the following persons may make a request that the
  7  6 contents of a recording created by a body camera be retained
  7  7 for three years: a person who is a part of the content of the
  7  8 recording; a person whose property has been seized or damaged
  7  9 in relation to, or is otherwise involved with, a crime that is
  7 10 related to the recording; a parent or guardian of a person who
  7 11 is part of the content of the recording or whose property was
  7 12 seized, damaged, or involved with a crime that is related to
  7 13 the recording; the attorney for a person who is part of the
  7 14 content of the recording or whose property was seized, damaged,
  7 15 or involved with a crime that is related to the recording; any
  7 16 other person if such person has been given written authority
  7 17 to disclose the contents of the recording by the person who
  7 18 is part of the content of the recording or whose property was
  7 19 seized or damaged.
  7 20    The bill provides that a person, who is not a part of the
  7 21 content of a recording created by a body camera, may request a
  7 22 copy of and receive such recording if each person who is part
  7 23 of the content of the recording consents in writing.
  7 24    Prior to deleting or disposing of the contents of a recording
  7 25 created by a body camera, the bill requires the person who has
  7 26 the responsibility of deleting or disposing of such a recording
  7 27 on behalf of the agency, to review all applicable and available
  7 28 records, files, and databases to ascertain whether any reason
  7 29 exists that the recording should not be disposed of or deleted.
  7 30    A peace officer who fails to record any interaction with
  7 31 a person or who fails to stop recording such interaction
  7 32 as required by the bill commits a violation. For a first
  7 33 violation of the bill a peace officer shall be given a written
  7 34 reprimand.  For a second or subsequent violation of the bill
  7 35 the peace officer shall be suspended until an investigation
  8  1 into the cause of the violation has been completed.
  8  2    The bill also provides that if an agency is unable to produce
  8  3 a body camera recording during a criminal prosecution or civil
  8  4 action, a rebuttable presumption arises that the recording
  8  5 would corroborate the version of the facts advanced by the
  8  6 defendant in the criminal action or the party opposing the
  8  7 peace officer or agency in the civil action.
  8  8    The bill specifies that an agency shall participate in any
  8  9 existing state or federal programs that fund or supplement
  8 10 the costs to purchase and maintain body cameras worn by peace
  8 11 officers.
  8 12    The bill may include a state mandate as defined in Code
  8 13 section 25B.3.  The bill makes inapplicable Code section 25B.2,
  8 14 subsection 3, which would relieve a political subdivision from
  8 15 complying with a state mandate if funding for the cost of
  8 16 the state mandate is not provided or specified.  Therefore,
  8 17 political subdivisions are required to comply with any state
  8 18 mandate included in the bill.

  5 12                           EXPLANATION
  5 13 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  5 14 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  5 15    This bill requires certain peace officers, including tribal
  5 16 law enforcement officers, to wear a body camera.
  5 17    The bill defines "agency" to mean a law enforcement agency.
  5 18    The bill defines "body camera" to mean an electronic device
  5 19 that is capable of recording video and audio data or capable of
  5 20 transmitting video and audio data to be recorded remotely, and
  5 21 is worn on the person of a peace officer.
  5 22    The body camera requirement applies to a county sheriff
  5 23 or deputy sheriff, city peace officer, peace officer member
  5 24 of the department of public safety, peace officer at a
  5 25 regents institution, conservation officer, an employee of the
  5 26 department of transportation designated as a peace officer,
  5 27 an employee of an aviation authority designated as a peace
  5 28 officer, and a certified tribal law enforcement officer.
  5 29    The bill requires a peace officer to wear a body camera
  5 30 at all times while on duty and in uniform.  The bill further
  5 31 requires that the peace officer record all interactions with
  5 32 people in the performance of the official duties of the peace
  5 33 officer from the beginning to the end of those interactions.
  5 34    The bill specifies that a body camera must be worn on the
  5 35 chest or at the eye level of the peace officer.
  6  1 The bill prohibits a body camera from containing facial
  6  2 recognition technology unless the use of such technology has
  6  3 been authorized by the court pursuant to an arrest or search
  6  4 warrant.
  6  5    The bill requires a peace officer to inform a person when
  6  6 that person is being recorded by a body camera unless informing
  6  7 the person would be unsafe, impractical, or impossible.
  6  8    If a peace officer who is wearing a body camera enters a
  6  9 residence without a warrant or where no exigent circumstances
  6 10 exist, the bill requires that the peace officer immediately ask
  6 11 whether the resident desires the peace officer to stop the body
  6 12 camera recording while the peace officer is in the residence.
  6 13 If the person responds in the affirmative, the bill requires
  6 14 the peace officer to stop the body camera recording.  The bill
  6 15 also requires the peace officer to record the question and any
  6 16 answer to the question.
  6 17    If a peace officer wearing a body camera interacts with a
  6 18 person reporting a crime, providing information regarding a
  6 19 crime or ongoing investigation, or claiming to be a victim of a
  6 20 crime, the bill requires the peace officer to immediately ask
  6 21 whether the person desires the peace officer to stop the body
  6 22 camera recording of the interaction.  If the person responds in
  6 23 the affirmative, the bill requires the peace officer to stop
  6 24 the body camera recording.  The bill also requires the peace
  6 25 officer to record the question and any answer to the question.
  6 26    The contents of a recording created by a body camera are
  6 27 confidential except as provided for in the bill.
  6 28    The bill requires that an agency shall retain the contents
  6 29 of a recording created by a body camera for 30 days.  However,
  6 30 an agency shall retain the contents of a recording created by
  6 31 a body camera for three years if any of the following apply:
  6 32 the recording depicts an incident involving the use of force;
  6 33 the recording depicts an incident that leads to detention or
  6 34 arrest of a person; the recording is relevant to a formal
  6 35 or informal complaint against a peace officer or agency; or
  7  1 a request has been made to retain the recording.  Under the
  7  2 bill, the contents of the recording may be retained even longer
  7  3 than three years if the contents may be relevant to a criminal
  7  4 prosecution.
  7  5    Any of the following persons may make a request that the
  7  6 contents of a recording created by a body camera be retained
  7  7 for three years: a person who is a part of the content of the
  7  8 recording; a person whose property has been seized or damaged
  7  9 in relation to, or is otherwise involved with, a crime that is
  7 10 related to the recording; a parent or guardian of a person who
  7 11 is part of the content of the recording or whose property was
  7 12 seized, damaged, or involved with a crime that is related to
  7 13 the recording; the attorney for a person who is part of the
  7 14 content of the recording or whose property was seized, damaged,
  7 15 or involved with a crime that is related to the recording; any
  7 16 other person if such person has been given written authority
  7 17 to disclose the contents of the recording by the person who
  7 18 is part of the content of the recording or whose property was
  7 19 seized or damaged.
  7 20    The bill provides that a person, who is not a part of the
  7 21 content of a recording created by a body camera, may request a
  7 22 copy of and receive such recording if each person who is part
  7 23 of the content of the recording consents in writing.
  7 24    Prior to deleting or disposing of the contents of a recording
  7 25 created by a body camera, the bill requires the person who has
  7 26 the responsibility of deleting or disposing of such a recording
  7 27 on behalf of the agency, to review all applicable and available
  7 28 records, files, and databases to ascertain whether any reason
  7 29 exists that the recording should not be disposed of or deleted.
  7 30    A peace officer who fails to record any interaction with
  7 31 a person or who fails to stop recording such interaction
  7 32 as required by the bill commits a violation. For a first
  7 33 violation of the bill a peace officer shall be given a written
  7 34 reprimand.  For a second or subsequent violation of the bill
  7 35 the peace officer shall be suspended until an investigation
  8  1 into the cause of the violation has been completed.
  8  2    The bill also provides that if an agency is unable to produce
  8  3 a body camera recording during a criminal prosecution or civil
  8  4 action, a rebuttable presumption arises that the recording
  8  5 would corroborate the version of the facts advanced by the
  8  6 defendant in the criminal action or the party opposing the
  8  7 peace officer or agency in the civil action.
  8  8    The bill specifies that an agency shall participate in any
  8  9 existing state or federal programs that fund or supplement
  8 10 the costs to purchase and maintain body cameras worn by peace
  8 11 officers.
  8 12    The bill may include a state mandate as defined in Code
  8 13 section 25B.3.  The bill makes inapplicable Code section 25B.2,
  8 14 subsection 3, which would relieve a political subdivision from
  8 15 complying with a state mandate if funding for the cost of
  8 16 the state mandate is not provided or specified.  Therefore,
  8 17 political subdivisions are required to comply with any state
  8 18 mandate included in the bill.

  5 12                           EXPLANATION
  5 13 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  5 14 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  5 15    This bill requires certain peace officers, including tribal
  5 16 law enforcement officers, to wear a body camera.
  5 17    The bill defines "agency" to mean a law enforcement agency.
  5 18    The bill defines "body camera" to mean an electronic device
  5 19 that is capable of recording video and audio data or capable of
  5 20 transmitting video and audio data to be recorded remotely, and
  5 21 is worn on the person of a peace officer.
  5 22    The body camera requirement applies to a county sheriff
  5 23 or deputy sheriff, city peace officer, peace officer member
  5 24 of the department of public safety, peace officer at a
  5 25 regents institution, conservation officer, an employee of the
  5 26 department of transportation designated as a peace officer,
  5 27 an employee of an aviation authority designated as a peace
  5 28 officer, and a certified tribal law enforcement officer.
  5 29    The bill requires a peace officer to wear a body camera
  5 30 at all times while on duty and in uniform.  The bill further
  5 31 requires that the peace officer record all interactions with
  5 32 people in the performance of the official duties of the peace
  5 33 officer from the beginning to the end of those interactions.
  5 34    The bill specifies that a body camera must be worn on the
  5 35 chest or at the eye level of the peace officer.
  6  1 The bill prohibits a body camera from containing facial
  6  2 recognition technology unless the use of such technology has
  6  3 been authorized by the court pursuant to an arrest or search
  6  4 warrant.
  6  5    The bill requires a peace officer to inform a person when
  6  6 that person is being recorded by a body camera unless informing
  6  7 the person would be unsafe, impractical, or impossible.
  6  8    If a peace officer who is wearing a body camera enters a
  6  9 residence without a warrant or where no exigent circumstances
  6 10 exist, the bill requires that the peace officer immediately ask
  6 11 whether the resident desires the peace officer to stop the body
  6 12 camera recording while the peace officer is in the residence.
  6 13 If the person responds in the affirmative, the bill requires
  6 14 the peace officer to stop the body camera recording.  The bill
  6 15 also requires the peace officer to record the question and any
  6 16 answer to the question.
  6 17    If a peace officer wearing a body camera interacts with a
  6 18 person reporting a crime, providing information regarding a
  6 19 crime or ongoing investigation, or claiming to be a victim of a
  6 20 crime, the bill requires the peace officer to immediately ask
  6 21 whether the person desires the peace officer to stop the body
  6 22 camera recording of the interaction.  If the person responds in
  6 23 the affirmative, the bill requires the peace officer to stop
  6 24 the body camera recording.  The bill also requires the peace
  6 25 officer to record the question and any answer to the question.
  6 26    The contents of a recording created by a body camera are
  6 27 confidential except as provided for in the bill.
  6 28    The bill requires that an agency shall retain the contents
  6 29 of a recording created by a body camera for 30 days.  However,
  6 30 an agency shall retain the contents of a recording created by
  6 31 a body camera for three years if any of the following apply:
  6 32 the recording depicts an incident involving the use of force;
  6 33 the recording depicts an incident that leads to detention or
  6 34 arrest of a person; the recording is relevant to a formal
  6 35 or informal complaint against a peace officer or agency; or
  7  1 a request has been made to retain the recording.  Under the
  7  2 bill, the contents of the recording may be retained even longer
  7  3 than three years if the contents may be relevant to a criminal
  7  4 prosecution.
  7  5    Any of the following persons may make a request that the
  7  6 contents of a recording created by a body camera be retained
  7  7 for three years: a person who is a part of the content of the
  7  8 recording; a person whose property has been seized or damaged
  7  9 in relation to, or is otherwise involved with, a crime that is
  7 10 related to the recording; a parent or guardian of a person who
  7 11 is part of the content of the recording or whose property was
  7 12 seized, damaged, or involved with a crime that is related to
  7 13 the recording; the attorney for a person who is part of the
  7 14 content of the recording or whose property was seized, damaged,
  7 15 or involved with a crime that is related to the recording; any
  7 16 other person if such person has been given written authority
  7 17 to disclose the contents of the recording by the person who
  7 18 is part of the content of the recording or whose property was
  7 19 seized or damaged.
  7 20    The bill provides that a person, who is not a part of the
  7 21 content of a recording created by a body camera, may request a
  7 22 copy of and receive such recording if each person who is part
  7 23 of the content of the recording consents in writing.
  7 24    Prior to deleting or disposing of the contents of a recording
  7 25 created by a body camera, the bill requires the person who has
  7 26 the responsibility of deleting or disposing of such a recording
  7 27 on behalf of the agency, to review all applicable and available
  7 28 records, files, and databases to ascertain whether any reason
  7 29 exists that the recording should not be disposed of or deleted.
  7 30    A peace officer who fails to record any interaction with
  7 31 a person or who fails to stop recording such interaction
  7 32 as required by the bill commits a violation. For a first
  7 33 violation of the bill a peace officer shall be given a written
  7 34 reprimand.  For a second or subsequent violation of the bill
  7 35 the peace officer shall be suspended until an investigation
  8  1 into the cause of the violation has been completed.
  8  2    The bill also provides that if an agency is unable to produce
  8  3 a body camera recording during a criminal prosecution or civil
  8  4 action, a rebuttable presumption arises that the recording
  8  5 would corroborate the version of the facts advanced by the
  8  6 defendant in the criminal action or the party opposing the
  8  7 peace officer or agency in the civil action.
  8  8    The bill specifies that an agency shall participate in any
  8  9 existing state or federal programs that fund or supplement
  8 10 the costs to purchase and maintain body cameras worn by peace
  8 11 officers.
  8 12    The bill may include a state mandate as defined in Code
  8 13 section 25B.3.  The bill makes inapplicable Code section 25B.2,
  8 14 subsection 3, which would relieve a political subdivision from
  8 15 complying with a state mandate if funding for the cost of
  8 16 the state mandate is not provided or specified.  Therefore,
  8 17 political subdivisions are required to comply with any state
  8 18 mandate included in the bill.

  5 12                           EXPLANATION
  5 13 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  5 14 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  5 15    This bill requires certain peace officers, including tribal
  5 16 law enforcement officers, to wear a body camera.
  5 17    The bill defines "agency" to mean a law enforcement agency.
  5 18    The bill defines "body camera" to mean an electronic device
  5 19 that is capable of recording video and audio data or capable of
  5 20 transmitting video and audio data to be recorded remotely, and
  5 21 is worn on the person of a peace officer.
  5 22    The body camera requirement applies to a county sheriff
  5 23 or deputy sheriff, city peace officer, peace officer member
  5 24 of the department of public safety, peace officer at a
  5 25 regents institution, conservation officer, an employee of the
  5 26 department of transportation designated as a peace officer,
  5 27 an employee of an aviation authority designated as a peace
  5 28 officer, and a certified tribal law enforcement officer.
  5 29    The bill requires a peace officer to wear a body camera
  5 30 at all times while on duty and in uniform.  The bill further
  5 31 requires that the peace officer record all interactions with
  5 32 people in the performance of the official duties of the peace
  5 33 officer from the beginning to the end of those interactions.
  5 34    The bill specifies that a body camera must be worn on the
  5 35 chest or at the eye level of the peace officer.
  6  1 The bill prohibits a body camera from containing facial
  6  2 recognition technology unless the use of such technology has
  6  3 been authorized by the court pursuant to an arrest or search
  6  4 warrant.
  6  5    The bill requires a peace officer to inform a person when
  6  6 that person is being recorded by a body camera unless informing
  6  7 the person would be unsafe, impractical, or impossible.
  6  8    If a peace officer who is wearing a body camera enters a
  6  9 residence without a warrant or where no exigent circumstances
  6 10 exist, the bill requires that the peace officer immediately ask
  6 11 whether the resident desires the peace officer to stop the body
  6 12 camera recording while the peace officer is in the residence.
  6 13 If the person responds in the affirmative, the bill requires
  6 14 the peace officer to stop the body camera recording.  The bill
  6 15 also requires the peace officer to record the question and any
  6 16 answer to the question.
  6 17    If a peace officer wearing a body camera interacts with a
  6 18 person reporting a crime, providing information regarding a
  6 19 crime or ongoing investigation, or claiming to be a victim of a
  6 20 crime, the bill requires the peace officer to immediately ask
  6 21 whether the person desires the peace officer to stop the body
  6 22 camera recording of the interaction.  If the person responds in
  6 23 the affirmative, the bill requires the peace officer to stop
  6 24 the body camera recording.  The bill also requires the peace
  6 25 officer to record the question and any answer to the question.
  6 26    The contents of a recording created by a body camera are
  6 27 confidential except as provided for in the bill.
  6 28    The bill requires that an agency shall retain the contents
  6 29 of a recording created by a body camera for 30 days.  However,
  6 30 an agency shall retain the contents of a recording created by
  6 31 a body camera for three years if any of the following apply:
  6 32 the recording depicts an incident involving the use of force;
  6 33 the recording depicts an incident that leads to detention or
  6 34 arrest of a person; the recording is relevant to a formal
  6 35 or informal complaint against a peace officer or agency; or
  7  1 a request has been made to retain the recording.  Under the
  7  2 bill, the contents of the recording may be retained even longer
  7  3 than three years if the contents may be relevant to a criminal
  7  4 prosecution.
  7  5    Any of the following persons may make a request that the
  7  6 contents of a recording created by a body camera be retained
  7  7 for three years: a person who is a part of the content of the
  7  8 recording; a person whose property has been seized or damaged
  7  9 in relation to, or is otherwise involved with, a crime that is
  7 10 related to the recording; a parent or guardian of a person who
  7 11 is part of the content of the recording or whose property was
  7 12 seized, damaged, or involved with a crime that is related to
  7 13 the recording; the attorney for a person who is part of the
  7 14 content of the recording or whose property was seized, damaged,
  7 15 or involved with a crime that is related to the recording; any
  7 16 other person if such person has been given written authority
  7 17 to disclose the contents of the recording by the person who
  7 18 is part of the content of the recording or whose property was
  7 19 seized or damaged.
  7 20    The bill provides that a person, who is not a part of the
  7 21 content of a recording created by a body camera, may request a
  7 22 copy of and receive such recording if each person who is part
  7 23 of the content of the recording consents in writing.
  7 24    Prior to deleting or disposing of the contents of a recording
  7 25 created by a body camera, the bill requires the person who has
  7 26 the responsibility of deleting or disposing of such a recording
  7 27 on behalf of the agency, to review all applicable and available
  7 28 records, files, and databases to ascertain whether any reason
  7 29 exists that the recording should not be disposed of or deleted.
  7 30    A peace officer who fails to record any interaction with
  7 31 a person or who fails to stop recording such interaction
  7 32 as required by the bill commits a violation. For a first
  7 33 violation of the bill a peace officer shall be given a written
  7 34 reprimand.  For a second or subsequent violation of the bill
  7 35 the peace officer shall be suspended until an investigation
  8  1 into the cause of the violation has been completed.
  8  2    The bill also provides that if an agency is unable to produce
  8  3 a body camera recording during a criminal prosecution or civil
  8  4 action, a rebuttable presumption arises that the recording
  8  5 would corroborate the version of the facts advanced by the
  8  6 defendant in the criminal action or the party opposing the
  8  7 peace officer or agency in the civil action.
  8  8    The bill specifies that an agency shall participate in any
  8  9 existing state or federal programs that fund or supplement
  8 10 the costs to purchase and maintain body cameras worn by peace
  8 11 officers.
  8 12    The bill may include a state mandate as defined in Code
  8 13 section 25B.3.  The bill makes inapplicable Code section 25B.2,
  8 14 subsection 3, which would relieve a political subdivision from
  8 15 complying with a state mandate if funding for the cost of
  8 16 the state mandate is not provided or specified.  Therefore,
  8 17 political subdivisions are required to comply with any state
  8 18 mandate included in the bill.

  5 12                           EXPLANATION
  5 13 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  5 14 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  5 15    This bill requires certain peace officers, including tribal
  5 16 law enforcement officers, to wear a body camera.
  5 17    The bill defines "agency" to mean a law enforcement agency.
  5 18    The bill defines "body camera" to mean an electronic device
  5 19 that is capable of recording video and audio data or capable of
  5 20 transmitting video and audio data to be recorded remotely, and
  5 21 is worn on the person of a peace officer.
  5 22    The body camera requirement applies to a county sheriff
  5 23 or deputy sheriff, city peace officer, peace officer member
  5 24 of the department of public safety, peace officer at a
  5 25 regents institution, conservation officer, an employee of the
  5 26 department of transportation designated as a peace officer,
  5 27 an employee of an aviation authority designated as a peace
  5 28 officer, and a certified tribal law enforcement officer.
  5 29    The bill requires a peace officer to wear a body camera
  5 30 at all times while on duty and in uniform.  The bill further
  5 31 requires that the peace officer record all interactions with
  5 32 people in the performance of the official duties of the peace
  5 33 officer from the beginning to the end of those interactions.
  5 34    The bill specifies that a body camera must be worn on the
  5 35 chest or at the eye level of the peace officer.
  6  1 The bill prohibits a body camera from containing facial
  6  2 recognition technology unless the use of such technology has
  6  3 been authorized by the court pursuant to an arrest or search
  6  4 warrant.
  6  5    The bill requires a peace officer to inform a person when
  6  6 that person is being recorded by a body camera unless informing
  6  7 the person would be unsafe, impractical, or impossible.
  6  8    If a peace officer who is wearing a body camera enters a
  6  9 residence without a warrant or where no exigent circumstances
  6 10 exist, the bill requires that the peace officer immediately ask
  6 11 whether the resident desires the peace officer to stop the body
  6 12 camera recording while the peace officer is in the residence.
  6 13 If the person responds in the affirmative, the bill requires
  6 14 the peace officer to stop the body camera recording.  The bill
  6 15 also requires the peace officer to record the question and any
  6 16 answer to the question.
  6 17    If a peace officer wearing a body camera interacts with a
  6 18 person reporting a crime, providing information regarding a
  6 19 crime or ongoing investigation, or claiming to be a victim of a
  6 20 crime, the bill requires the peace officer to immediately ask
  6 21 whether the person desires the peace officer to stop the body
  6 22 camera recording of the interaction.  If the person responds in
  6 23 the affirmative, the bill requires the peace officer to stop
  6 24 the body camera recording.  The bill also requires the peace
  6 25 officer to record the question and any answer to the question.
  6 26    The contents of a recording created by a body camera are
  6 27 confidential except as provided for in the bill.
  6 28    The bill requires that an agency shall retain the contents
  6 29 of a recording created by a body camera for 30 days.  However,
  6 30 an agency shall retain the contents of a recording created by
  6 31 a body camera for three years if any of the following apply:
  6 32 the recording depicts an incident involving the use of force;
  6 33 the recording depicts an incident that leads to detention or
  6 34 arrest of a person; the recording is relevant to a formal
  6 35 or informal complaint against a peace officer or agency; or
  7  1 a request has been made to retain the recording.  Under the
  7  2 bill, the contents of the recording may be retained even longer
  7  3 than three years if the contents may be relevant to a criminal
  7  4 prosecution.
  7  5    Any of the following persons may make a request that the
  7  6 contents of a recording created by a body camera be retained
  7  7 for three years: a person who is a part of the content of the
  7  8 recording; a person whose property has been seized or damaged
  7  9 in relation to, or is otherwise involved with, a crime that is
  7 10 related to the recording; a parent or guardian of a person who
  7 11 is part of the content of the recording or whose property was
  7 12 seized, damaged, or involved with a crime that is related to
  7 13 the recording; the attorney for a person who is part of the
  7 14 content of the recording or whose property was seized, damaged,
  7 15 or involved with a crime that is related to the recording; any
  7 16 other person if such person has been given written authority
  7 17 to disclose the contents of the recording by the person who
  7 18 is part of the content of the recording or whose property was
  7 19 seized or damaged.
  7 20    The bill provides that a person, who is not a part of the
  7 21 content of a recording created by a body camera, may request a
  7 22 copy of and receive such recording if each person who is part
  7 23 of the content of the recording consents in writing.
  7 24    Prior to deleting or disposing of the contents of a recording
  7 25 created by a body camera, the bill requires the person who has
  7 26 the responsibility of deleting or disposing of such a recording
  7 27 on behalf of the agency, to review all applicable and available
  7 28 records, files, and databases to ascertain whether any reason
  7 29 exists that the recording should not be disposed of or deleted.
  7 30    A peace officer who fails to record any interaction with
  7 31 a person or who fails to stop recording such interaction
  7 32 as required by the bill commits a violation. For a first
  7 33 violation of the bill a peace officer shall be given a written
  7 34 reprimand.  For a second or subsequent violation of the bill
  7 35 the peace officer shall be suspended until an investigation
  8  1 into the cause of the violation has been completed.
  8  2    The bill also provides that if an agency is unable to produce
  8  3 a body camera recording during a criminal prosecution or civil
  8  4 action, a rebuttable presumption arises that the recording
  8  5 would corroborate the version of the facts advanced by the
  8  6 defendant in the criminal action or the party opposing the
  8  7 peace officer or agency in the civil action.
  8  8    The bill specifies that an agency shall participate in any
  8  9 existing state or federal programs that fund or supplement
  8 10 the costs to purchase and maintain body cameras worn by peace
  8 11 officers.
  8 12    The bill may include a state mandate as defined in Code
  8 13 section 25B.3.  The bill makes inapplicable Code section 25B.2,
  8 14 subsection 3, which would relieve a political subdivision from
  8 15 complying with a state mandate if funding for the cost of
  8 16 the state mandate is not provided or specified.  Therefore,
  8 17 political subdivisions are required to comply with any state
  8 18 mandate included in the bill.

  5 12                           EXPLANATION
  5 13 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  5 14 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  5 15    This bill requires certain peace officers, including tribal
  5 16 law enforcement officers, to wear a body camera.
  5 17    The bill defines "agency" to mean a law enforcement agency.
  5 18    The bill defines "body camera" to mean an electronic device
  5 19 that is capable of recording video and audio data or capable of
  5 20 transmitting video and audio data to be recorded remotely, and
  5 21 is worn on the person of a peace officer.
  5 22    The body camera requirement applies to a county sheriff
  5 23 or deputy sheriff, city peace officer, peace officer member
  5 24 of the department of public safety, peace officer at a
  5 25 regents institution, conservation officer, an employee of the
  5 26 department of transportation designated as a peace officer,
  5 27 an employee of an aviation authority designated as a peace
  5 28 officer, and a certified tribal law enforcement officer.
  5 29    The bill requires a peace officer to wear a body camera
  5 30 at all times while on duty and in uniform.  The bill further
  5 31 requires that the peace officer record all interactions with
  5 32 people in the performance of the official duties of the peace
  5 33 officer from the beginning to the end of those interactions.
  5 34    The bill specifies that a body camera must be worn on the
  5 35 chest or at the eye level of the peace officer.
  6  1 The bill prohibits a body camera from containing facial
  6  2 recognition technology unless the use of such technology has
  6  3 been authorized by the court pursuant to an arrest or search
  6  4 warrant.
  6  5    The bill requires a peace officer to inform a person when
  6  6 that person is being recorded by a body camera unless informing
  6  7 the person would be unsafe, impractical, or impossible.
  6  8    If a peace officer who is wearing a body camera enters a
  6  9 residence without a warrant or where no exigent circumstances
  6 10 exist, the bill requires that the peace officer immediately ask
  6 11 whether the resident desires the peace officer to stop the body
  6 12 camera recording while the peace officer is in the residence.
  6 13 If the person responds in the affirmative, the bill requires
  6 14 the peace officer to stop the body camera recording.  The bill
  6 15 also requires the peace officer to record the question and any
  6 16 answer to the question.
  6 17    If a peace officer wearing a body camera interacts with a
  6 18 person reporting a crime, providing information regarding a
  6 19 crime or ongoing investigation, or claiming to be a victim of a
  6 20 crime, the bill requires the peace officer to immediately ask
  6 21 whether the person desires the peace officer to stop the body
  6 22 camera recording of the interaction.  If the person responds in
  6 23 the affirmative, the bill requires the peace officer to stop
  6 24 the body camera recording.  The bill also requires the peace
  6 25 officer to record the question and any answer to the question.
  6 26    The contents of a recording created by a body camera are
  6 27 confidential except as provided for in the bill.
  6 28    The bill requires that an agency shall retain the contents
  6 29 of a recording created by a body camera for 30 days.  However,
  6 30 an agency shall retain the contents of a recording created by
  6 31 a body camera for three years if any of the following apply:
  6 32 the recording depicts an incident involving the use of force;
  6 33 the recording depicts an incident that leads to detention or
  6 34 arrest of a person; the recording is relevant to a formal
  6 35 or informal complaint against a peace officer or agency; or
  7  1 a request has been made to retain the recording.  Under the
  7  2 bill, the contents of the recording may be retained even longer
  7  3 than three years if the contents may be relevant to a criminal
  7  4 prosecution.
  7  5    Any of the following persons may make a request that the
  7  6 contents of a recording created by a body camera be retained
  7  7 for three years: a person who is a part of the content of the
  7  8 recording; a person whose property has been seized or damaged
  7  9 in relation to, or is otherwise involved with, a crime that is
  7 10 related to the recording; a parent or guardian of a person who
  7 11 is part of the content of the recording or whose property was
  7 12 seized, damaged, or involved with a crime that is related to
  7 13 the recording; the attorney for a person who is part of the
  7 14 content of the recording or whose property was seized, damaged,
  7 15 or involved with a crime that is related to the recording; any
  7 16 other person if such person has been given written authority
  7 17 to disclose the contents of the recording by the person who
  7 18 is part of the content of the recording or whose property was
  7 19 seized or damaged.
  7 20    The bill provides that a person, who is not a part of the
  7 21 content of a recording created by a body camera, may request a
  7 22 copy of and receive such recording if each person who is part
  7 23 of the content of the recording consents in writing.
  7 24    Prior to deleting or disposing of the contents of a recording
  7 25 created by a body camera, the bill requires the person who has
  7 26 the responsibility of deleting or disposing of such a recording
  7 27 on behalf of the agency, to review all applicable and available
  7 28 records, files, and databases to ascertain whether any reason
  7 29 exists that the recording should not be disposed of or deleted.
  7 30    A peace officer who fails to record any interaction with
  7 31 a person or who fails to stop recording such interaction
  7 32 as required by the bill commits a violation. For a first
  7 33 violation of the bill a peace officer shall be given a written
  7 34 reprimand.  For a second or subsequent violation of the bill
  7 35 the peace officer shall be suspended until an investigation
  8  1 into the cause of the violation has been completed.
  8  2    The bill also provides that if an agency is unable to produce
  8  3 a body camera recording during a criminal prosecution or civil
  8  4 action, a rebuttable presumption arises that the recording
  8  5 would corroborate the version of the facts advanced by the
  8  6 defendant in the criminal action or the party opposing the
  8  7 peace officer or agency in the civil action.
  8  8    The bill specifies that an agency shall participate in any
  8  9 existing state or federal programs that fund or supplement
  8 10 the costs to purchase and maintain body cameras worn by peace
  8 11 officers.
  8 12    The bill may include a state mandate as defined in Code
  8 13 section 25B.3.  The bill makes inapplicable Code section 25B.2,
  8 14 subsection 3, which would relieve a political subdivision from
  8 15 complying with a state mandate if funding for the cost of
  8 16 the state mandate is not provided or specified.  Therefore,
  8 17 political subdivisions are required to comply with any state
  8 18 mandate included in the bill.

  3 17 shall be extended to equal the time period for the retention of
  3 18 other evidence that may be use in the criminal prosecution.

  6  8    If a peace officer who is wearing a body camera enters a
  6  9 residence without a warrant or where no exigent circumstances
  6 10 exist, the bill requires that the peace officer immediately ask
  6 11 whether the resident desires the peace officer to stop the body
  6 12 camera recording while the peace officer is in the residence.
  6 13 If the person responds in the affirmative, the bill requires
  6 14 the peace officer to stop the body camera recording.  The bill
  6 15 also requires the peace officer to record the question and any
  6 16 answer to the question.
  6 17    If a peace officer wearing a body camera interacts with a
  6 18 person reporting a crime, providing information regarding a
  6 19 crime or ongoing investigation, or claiming to be a victim of a
  6 20 crime, the bill requires the peace officer to immediately ask
  6 21 whether the person desires the peace officer to stop the body
  6 22 camera recording of the interaction.  If the person responds in
  6 23 the affirmative, the bill requires the peace officer to stop
  6 24 the body camera recording.  The bill also requires the peace
  6 25 officer to record the question and any answer to the question.
  6 26    The contents of a recording created by a body camera are
  6 27 confidential except as provided for in the bill.
  6 28    The bill requires that an agency shall retain the contents
  6 29 of a recording created by a body camera for 30 days.  However,
  6 30 an agency shall retain the contents of a recording created by
  6 31 a body camera for three years if any of the following apply:
  6 32 the recording depicts an incident involving the use of force;
  6 33 the recording depicts an incident that leads to detention or
  6 34 arrest of a person; the recording is relevant to a formal
  6 35 or informal complaint against a peace officer or agency; or
  7  1 a request has been made to retain the recording.  Under the
  7  2 bill, the contents of the recording may be retained even longer
  7  3 than three years if the contents may be relevant to a criminal
  7  4 prosecution.
  7  5    Any of the following persons may make a request that the
  7  6 contents of a recording created by a body camera be retained
  7  7 for three years: a person who is a part of the content of the
  7  8 recording; a person whose property has been seized or damaged
  7  9 in relation to, or is otherwise involved with, a crime that is
  7 10 related to the recording; a parent or guardian of a person who
  7 11 is part of the content of the recording or whose property was
  7 12 seized, damaged, or involved with a crime that is related to
  7 13 the recording; the attorney for a person who is part of the
  7 14 content of the recording or whose property was seized, damaged,
  7 15 or involved with a crime that is related to the recording; any
  7 16 other person if such person has been given written authority
  7 17 to disclose the contents of the recording by the person who
  7 18 is part of the content of the recording or whose property was
  7 19 seized or damaged.
  7 20    The bill provides that a person, who is not a part of the
  7 21 content of a recording created by a body camera, may request a
  7 22 copy of and receive such recording if each person who is part
  7 23 of the content of the recording consents in writing.
  7 24    Prior to deleting or disposing of the contents of a recording
  7 25 created by a body camera, the bill requires the person who has
  7 26 the responsibility of deleting or disposing of such a recording
  7 27 on behalf of the agency, to review all applicable and available
  7 28 records, files, and databases to ascertain whether any reason
  7 29 exists that the recording should not be disposed of or deleted.
  7 30    A peace officer who fails to record any interaction with
  7 31 a person or who fails to stop recording such interaction
  7 32 as required by the bill commits a violation. For a first
  7 33 violation of the bill a peace officer shall be given a written
  7 34 reprimand.  For a second or subsequent violation of the bill
  7 35 the peace officer shall be suspended until an investigation
  8  1 into the cause of the violation has been completed.
  8  2    The bill also provides that if an agency is unable to produce
  8  3 a body camera recording during a criminal prosecution or civil
  8  4 action, a rebuttable presumption arises that the recording
  8  5 would corroborate the version of the facts advanced by the
  8  6 defendant in the criminal action or the party opposing the
  8  7 peace officer or agency in the civil action.
  8  8    The bill specifies that an agency shall participate in any
  8  9 existing state or federal programs that fund or supplement
  8 10 the costs to purchase and maintain body cameras worn by peace
  8 11 officers.
  8 12    The bill may include a state mandate as defined in Code
  8 13 section 25B.3.  The bill makes inapplicable Code section 25B.2,
  8 14 subsection 3, which would relieve a political subdivision from
  8 15 complying with a state mandate if funding for the cost of
  8 16 the state mandate is not provided or specified.  Therefore,
  8 17 political subdivisions are required to comply with any state
  8 18 mandate included in the bill.

  7 17 to disclose the contents of the recording by the person who
  7 18 is part of the content of the recording or whose property was
  7 19 seized or damaged.

  7 21 content of a recording created by a body camera, may request a
  7 22 copy of and receive such recording if each person who is part
  7 23 of the content of the recording consents in writing.
  7 24    Prior to deleting or disposing of the contents of a recording
  7 25 created by a body camera, the bill requires the person who has
  7 26 the responsibility of deleting or disposing of such a recording
  7 27 on behalf of the agency, to review all applicable and available
  7 28 records, files, and databases to ascertain whether any reason
  7 29 exists that the recording should not be disposed of or deleted.
  7 30    A peace officer who fails to record any interaction with
  7 31 a person or who fails to stop recording such interaction
  7 32 as required by the bill commits a violation. For a first

  7 34 reprimand.  For a second or subsequent violation of the bill
  7 35 the peace officer shall be suspended until an investigation
  8  1 into the cause of the violation has been completed.
  8  2    The bill also provides that if an agency is unable to produce
  8  3 a body camera recording during a criminal prosecution or civil
  8  4 action, a rebuttable presumption arises that the recording
  8  5 would corroborate the version of the facts advanced by the
  8  6 defendant in the criminal action or the party opposing the
  8  7 peace officer or agency in the civil action.
  8  8    The bill specifies that an agency shall participate in any
  8  9 existing state or federal programs that fund or supplement
  8 10 the costs to purchase and maintain body cameras worn by peace
  8 11 officers.
  8 12    The bill may include a state mandate as defined in Code
  8 13 section 25B.3.  The bill makes inapplicable Code section 25B.2,
  8 14 subsection 3, which would relieve a political subdivision from
  8 15 complying with a state mandate if funding for the cost of
  8 16 the state mandate is not provided or specified.  Therefore,
  8 17 political subdivisions are required to comply with any state
  8 18 mandate included in the bill.

  5 12                           EXPLANATION
  5 13 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  5 14 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  5 15    This bill requires certain peace officers, including tribal
  5 16 law enforcement officers, to wear a body camera.
  5 17    The bill defines "agency" to mean a law enforcement agency.
  5 18    The bill defines "body camera" to mean an electronic device
  5 19 that is capable of recording video and audio data or capable of
  5 20 transmitting video and audio data to be recorded remotely, and
  5 21 is worn on the person of a peace officer.
  5 22    The body camera requirement applies to a county sheriff
  5 23 or deputy sheriff, city peace officer, peace officer member
  5 24 of the department of public safety, peace officer at a
  5 25 regents institution, conservation officer, an employee of the
  5 26 department of transportation designated as a peace officer,
  5 27 an employee of an aviation authority designated as a peace
  5 28 officer, and a certified tribal law enforcement officer.
  5 29    The bill requires a peace officer to wear a body camera
  5 30 at all times while on duty and in uniform.  The bill further
  5 31 requires that the peace officer record all interactions with
  5 32 people in the performance of the official duties of the peace
  5 33 officer from the beginning to the end of those interactions.
  5 34    The bill specifies that a body camera must be worn on the
  5 35 chest or at the eye level of the peace officer.
  6  1 The bill prohibits a body camera from containing facial
  6  2 recognition technology unless the use of such technology has
  6  3 been authorized by the court pursuant to an arrest or search
  6  4 warrant.
  6  5    The bill requires a peace officer to inform a person when
  6  6 that person is being recorded by a body camera unless informing
  6  7 the person would be unsafe, impractical, or impossible.
  6  8    If a peace officer who is wearing a body camera enters a
  6  9 residence without a warrant or where no exigent circumstances
  6 10 exist, the bill requires that the peace officer immediately ask
  6 11 whether the resident desires the peace officer to stop the body
  6 12 camera recording while the peace officer is in the residence.
  6 13 If the person responds in the affirmative, the bill requires
  6 14 the peace officer to stop the body camera recording.  The bill
  6 15 also requires the peace officer to record the question and any
  6 16 answer to the question.
  6 17    If a peace officer wearing a body camera interacts with a
  6 18 person reporting a crime, providing information regarding a
  6 19 crime or ongoing investigation, or claiming to be a victim of a
  6 20 crime, the bill requires the peace officer to immediately ask
  6 21 whether the person desires the peace officer to stop the body
  6 22 camera recording of the interaction.  If the person responds in
  6 23 the affirmative, the bill requires the peace officer to stop
  6 24 the body camera recording.  The bill also requires the peace
  6 25 officer to record the question and any answer to the question.
  6 26    The contents of a recording created by a body camera are
  6 27 confidential except as provided for in the bill.
  6 28    The bill requires that an agency shall retain the contents
  6 29 of a recording created by a body camera for 30 days.  However,
  6 30 an agency shall retain the contents of a recording created by
  6 31 a body camera for three years if any of the following apply:
  6 32 the recording depicts an incident involving the use of force;
  6 33 the recording depicts an incident that leads to detention or
  6 34 arrest of a person; the recording is relevant to a formal
  6 35 or informal complaint against a peace officer or agency; or
  7  1 a request has been made to retain the recording.  Under the
  7  2 bill, the contents of the recording may be retained even longer
  7  3 than three years if the contents may be relevant to a criminal
  7  4 prosecution.
  7  5    Any of the following persons may make a request that the
  7  6 contents of a recording created by a body camera be retained
  7  7 for three years: a person who is a part of the content of the
  7  8 recording; a person whose property has been seized or damaged
  7  9 in relation to, or is otherwise involved with, a crime that is
  7 10 related to the recording; a parent or guardian of a person who
  7 11 is part of the content of the recording or whose property was
  7 12 seized, damaged, or involved with a crime that is related to
  7 13 the recording; the attorney for a person who is part of the
  7 14 content of the recording or whose property was seized, damaged,
  7 15 or involved with a crime that is related to the recording; any
  7 16 other person if such person has been given written authority
  7 17 to disclose the contents of the recording by the person who
  7 18 is part of the content of the recording or whose property was
  7 19 seized or damaged.
  7 20    The bill provides that a person, who is not a part of the
  7 21 content of a recording created by a body camera, may request a
  7 22 copy of and receive such recording if each person who is part
  7 23 of the content of the recording consents in writing.
  7 24    Prior to deleting or disposing of the contents of a recording
  7 25 created by a body camera, the bill requires the person who has
  7 26 the responsibility of deleting or disposing of such a recording
  7 27 on behalf of the agency, to review all applicable and available
  7 28 records, files, and databases to ascertain whether any reason
  7 29 exists that the recording should not be disposed of or deleted.
  7 30    A peace officer who fails to record any interaction with
  7 31 a person or who fails to stop recording such interaction
  7 32 as required by the bill commits a violation. For a first
  7 33 violation of the bill a peace officer shall be given a written
  7 34 reprimand.  For a second or subsequent violation of the bill
  7 35 the peace officer shall be suspended until an investigation
  8  1 into the cause of the violation has been completed.
  8  2    The bill also provides that if an agency is unable to produce
  8  3 a body camera recording during a criminal prosecution or civil
  8  4 action, a rebuttable presumption arises that the recording
  8  5 would corroborate the version of the facts advanced by the
  8  6 defendant in the criminal action or the party opposing the
  8  7 peace officer or agency in the civil action.
  8  8    The bill specifies that an agency shall participate in any
  8  9 existing state or federal programs that fund or supplement
  8 10 the costs to purchase and maintain body cameras worn by peace
  8 11 officers.
  8 12    The bill may include a state mandate as defined in Code

  8 14 subsection 3, which would relieve a political subdivision from

  5  5 action or the party opposing the peace officer or agency in the
  5  6 civil action.
  5  7    9.  The agency shall participate in any existing state or

  5 12                           EXPLANATION
  5 13 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  5 14 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  5 15    This bill requires certain peace officers, including tribal
  5 16 law enforcement officers, to wear a body camera.
  5 17    The bill defines "agency" to mean a law enforcement agency.
  5 18    The bill defines "body camera" to mean an electronic device
  5 19 that is capable of recording video and audio data or capable of
  5 20 transmitting video and audio data to be recorded remotely, and
  5 21 is worn on the person of a peace officer.
  5 22    The body camera requirement applies to a county sheriff
  5 23 or deputy sheriff, city peace officer, peace officer member
  5 24 of the department of public safety, peace officer at a
  5 25 regents institution, conservation officer, an employee of the
  5 26 department of transportation designated as a peace officer,
  5 27 an employee of an aviation authority designated as a peace
  5 28 officer, and a certified tribal law enforcement officer.
  5 29    The bill requires a peace officer to wear a body camera
  5 30 at all times while on duty and in uniform.  The bill further
  5 31 requires that the peace officer record all interactions with
  5 32 people in the performance of the official duties of the peace
  5 33 officer from the beginning to the end of those interactions.
  5 34    The bill specifies that a body camera must be worn on the
  5 35 chest or at the eye level of the peace officer.
  6  1 The bill prohibits a body camera from containing facial
  6  2 recognition technology unless the use of such technology has
  6  3 been authorized by the court pursuant to an arrest or search
  6  4 warrant.
  6  5    The bill requires a peace officer to inform a person when
  6  6 that person is being recorded by a body camera unless informing
  6  7 the person would be unsafe, impractical, or impossible.
  6  8    If a peace officer who is wearing a body camera enters a
  6  9 residence without a warrant or where no exigent circumstances
  6 10 exist, the bill requires that the peace officer immediately ask
  6 11 whether the resident desires the peace officer to stop the body
  6 12 camera recording while the peace officer is in the residence.
  6 13 If the person responds in the affirmative, the bill requires
  6 14 the peace officer to stop the body camera recording.  The bill
  6 15 also requires the peace officer to record the question and any
  6 16 answer to the question.
  6 17    If a peace officer wearing a body camera interacts with a
  6 18 person reporting a crime, providing information regarding a
  6 19 crime or ongoing investigation, or claiming to be a victim of a
  6 20 crime, the bill requires the peace officer to immediately ask
  6 21 whether the person desires the peace officer to stop the body
  6 22 camera recording of the interaction.  If the person responds in
  6 23 the affirmative, the bill requires the peace officer to stop
  6 24 the body camera recording.  The bill also requires the peace
  6 25 officer to record the question and any answer to the question.
  6 26    The contents of a recording created by a body camera are
  6 27 confidential except as provided for in the bill.
  6 28    The bill requires that an agency shall retain the contents
  6 29 of a recording created by a body camera for 30 days.  However,
  6 30 an agency shall retain the contents of a recording created by
  6 31 a body camera for three years if any of the following apply:
  6 32 the recording depicts an incident involving the use of force;
  6 33 the recording depicts an incident that leads to detention or
  6 34 arrest of a person; the recording is relevant to a formal
  6 35 or informal complaint against a peace officer or agency; or
  7  1 a request has been made to retain the recording.  Under the
  7  2 bill, the contents of the recording may be retained even longer
  7  3 than three years if the contents may be relevant to a criminal
  7  4 prosecution.
  7  5    Any of the following persons may make a request that the
  7  6 contents of a recording created by a body camera be retained
  7  7 for three years: a person who is a part of the content of the
  7  8 recording; a person whose property has been seized or damaged
  7  9 in relation to, or is otherwise involved with, a crime that is
  7 10 related to the recording; a parent or guardian of a person who
  7 11 is part of the content of the recording or whose property was
  7 12 seized, damaged, or involved with a crime that is related to
  7 13 the recording; the attorney for a person who is part of the
  7 14 content of the recording or whose property was seized, damaged,
  7 15 or involved with a crime that is related to the recording; any
  7 16 other person if such person has been given written authority
  7 17 to disclose the contents of the recording by the person who
  7 18 is part of the content of the recording or whose property was
  7 19 seized or damaged.
  7 20    The bill provides that a person, who is not a part of the
  7 21 content of a recording created by a body camera, may request a
  7 22 copy of and receive such recording if each person who is part
  7 23 of the content of the recording consents in writing.
  7 24    Prior to deleting or disposing of the contents of a recording
  7 25 created by a body camera, the bill requires the person who has
  7 26 the responsibility of deleting or disposing of such a recording
  7 27 on behalf of the agency, to review all applicable and available
  7 28 records, files, and databases to ascertain whether any reason
  7 29 exists that the recording should not be disposed of or deleted.
  7 30    A peace officer who fails to record any interaction with
  7 31 a person or who fails to stop recording such interaction
  7 32 as required by the bill commits a violation. For a first
  7 33 violation of the bill a peace officer shall be given a written
  7 34 reprimand.  For a second or subsequent violation of the bill
  7 35 the peace officer shall be suspended until an investigation
  8  1 into the cause of the violation has been completed.
  8  2    The bill also provides that if an agency is unable to produce
  8  3 a body camera recording during a criminal prosecution or civil
  8  4 action, a rebuttable presumption arises that the recording
  8  5 would corroborate the version of the facts advanced by the
  8  6 defendant in the criminal action or the party opposing the
  8  7 peace officer or agency in the civil action.
  8  8    The bill specifies that an agency shall participate in any
  8  9 existing state or federal programs that fund or supplement
  8 10 the costs to purchase and maintain body cameras worn by peace
  8 11 officers.
  8 12    The bill may include a state mandate as defined in Code
  8 13 section 25B.3.  The bill makes inapplicable Code section 25B.2,
  8 14 subsection 3, which would relieve a political subdivision from
  8 15 complying with a state mandate if funding for the cost of
  8 16 the state mandate is not provided or specified.  Therefore,
  8 17 political subdivisions are required to comply with any state
  8 18 mandate included in the bill.

  5 12                           EXPLANATION
  5 13 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  5 14 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  5 15    This bill requires certain peace officers, including tribal
  5 16 law enforcement officers, to wear a body camera.
  5 17    The bill defines "agency" to mean a law enforcement agency.
  5 18    The bill defines "body camera" to mean an electronic device
  5 19 that is capable of recording video and audio data or capable of
  5 20 transmitting video and audio data to be recorded remotely, and
  5 21 is worn on the person of a peace officer.
  5 22    The body camera requirement applies to a county sheriff
  5 23 or deputy sheriff, city peace officer, peace officer member
  5 24 of the department of public safety, peace officer at a
  5 25 regents institution, conservation officer, an employee of the
  5 26 department of transportation designated as a peace officer,
  5 27 an employee of an aviation authority designated as a peace
  5 28 officer, and a certified tribal law enforcement officer.
  5 29    The bill requires a peace officer to wear a body camera
  5 30 at all times while on duty and in uniform.  The bill further
  5 31 requires that the peace officer record all interactions with
  5 32 people in the performance of the official duties of the peace
  5 33 officer from the beginning to the end of those interactions.
  5 34    The bill specifies that a body camera must be worn on the
  5 35 chest or at the eye level of the peace officer.
  6  1 The bill prohibits a body camera from containing facial
  6  2 recognition technology unless the use of such technology has
  6  3 been authorized by the court pursuant to an arrest or search
  6  4 warrant.
  6  5    The bill requires a peace officer to inform a person when
  6  6 that person is being recorded by a body camera unless informing
  6  7 the person would be unsafe, impractical, or impossible.
  6  8    If a peace officer who is wearing a body camera enters a
  6  9 residence without a warrant or where no exigent circumstances
  6 10 exist, the bill requires that the peace officer immediately ask
  6 11 whether the resident desires the peace officer to stop the body
  6 12 camera recording while the peace officer is in the residence.
  6 13 If the person responds in the affirmative, the bill requires
  6 14 the peace officer to stop the body camera recording.  The bill
  6 15 also requires the peace officer to record the question and any
  6 16 answer to the question.
  6 17    If a peace officer wearing a body camera interacts with a
  6 18 person reporting a crime, providing information regarding a
  6 19 crime or ongoing investigation, or claiming to be a victim of a
  6 20 crime, the bill requires the peace officer to immediately ask
  6 21 whether the person desires the peace officer to stop the body
  6 22 camera recording of the interaction.  If the person responds in
  6 23 the affirmative, the bill requires the peace officer to stop
  6 24 the body camera recording.  The bill also requires the peace
  6 25 officer to record the question and any answer to the question.
  6 26    The contents of a recording created by a body camera are
  6 27 confidential except as provided for in the bill.
  6 28    The bill requires that an agency shall retain the contents
  6 29 of a recording created by a body camera for 30 days.  However,
  6 30 an agency shall retain the contents of a recording created by
  6 31 a body camera for three years if any of the following apply:
  6 32 the recording depicts an incident involving the use of force;
  6 33 the recording depicts an incident that leads to detention or
  6 34 arrest of a person; the recording is relevant to a formal
  6 35 or informal complaint against a peace officer or agency; or
  7  1 a request has been made to retain the recording.  Under the
  7  2 bill, the contents of the recording may be retained even longer
  7  3 than three years if the contents may be relevant to a criminal
  7  4 prosecution.
  7  5    Any of the following persons may make a request that the
  7  6 contents of a recording created by a body camera be retained
  7  7 for three years: a person who is a part of the content of the
  7  8 recording; a person whose property has been seized or damaged
  7  9 in relation to, or is otherwise involved with, a crime that is
  7 10 related to the recording; a parent or guardian of a person who
  7 11 is part of the content of the recording or whose property was
  7 12 seized, damaged, or involved with a crime that is related to
  7 13 the recording; the attorney for a person who is part of the
  7 14 content of the recording or whose property was seized, damaged,
  7 15 or involved with a crime that is related to the recording; any
  7 16 other person if such person has been given written authority
  7 17 to disclose the contents of the recording by the person who
  7 18 is part of the content of the recording or whose property was
  7 19 seized or damaged.
  7 20    The bill provides that a person, who is not a part of the
  7 21 content of a recording created by a body camera, may request a
  7 22 copy of and receive such recording if each person who is part
  7 23 of the content of the recording consents in writing.
  7 24    Prior to deleting or disposing of the contents of a recording
  7 25 created by a body camera, the bill requires the person who has
  7 26 the responsibility of deleting or disposing of such a recording
  7 27 on behalf of the agency, to review all applicable and available
  7 28 records, files, and databases to ascertain whether any reason
  7 29 exists that the recording should not be disposed of or deleted.
  7 30    A peace officer who fails to record any interaction with
  7 31 a person or who fails to stop recording such interaction
  7 32 as required by the bill commits a violation. For a first
  7 33 violation of the bill a peace officer shall be given a written
  7 34 reprimand.  For a second or subsequent violation of the bill
  7 35 the peace officer shall be suspended until an investigation
  8  1 into the cause of the violation has been completed.
  8  2    The bill also provides that if an agency is unable to produce
  8  3 a body camera recording during a criminal prosecution or civil
  8  4 action, a rebuttable presumption arises that the recording
  8  5 would corroborate the version of the facts advanced by the
  8  6 defendant in the criminal action or the party opposing the
  8  7 peace officer or agency in the civil action.
  8  8    The bill specifies that an agency shall participate in any
  8  9 existing state or federal programs that fund or supplement
  8 10 the costs to purchase and maintain body cameras worn by peace
  8 11 officers.
  8 12    The bill may include a state mandate as defined in Code
  8 13 section 25B.3.  The bill makes inapplicable Code section 25B.2,
  8 14 subsection 3, which would relieve a political subdivision from
  8 15 complying with a state mandate if funding for the cost of
  8 16 the state mandate is not provided or specified.  Therefore,
  8 17 political subdivisions are required to comply with any state
  8 18 mandate included in the bill.

  5 28 officer, and a certified tribal law enforcement officer.
  5 29    The bill requires a peace officer to wear a body camera
  5 30 at all times while on duty and in uniform.  The bill further
  5 31 requires that the peace officer record all interactions with
  5 32 people in the performance of the official duties of the peace
  5 33 officer from the beginning to the end of those interactions.
  5 34    The bill specifies that a body camera must be worn on the
  5 35 chest or at the eye level of the peace officer.
  6  1 The bill prohibits a body camera from containing facial
  6  2 recognition technology unless the use of such technology has
  6  3 been authorized by the court pursuant to an arrest or search
  6  4 warrant.
  6  5    The bill requires a peace officer to inform a person when
  6  6 that person is being recorded by a body camera unless informing
  6  7 the person would be unsafe, impractical, or impossible.
  6  8    If a peace officer who is wearing a body camera enters a
  6  9 residence without a warrant or where no exigent circumstances
  6 10 exist, the bill requires that the peace officer immediately ask
  6 11 whether the resident desires the peace officer to stop the body
  6 12 camera recording while the peace officer is in the residence.
  6 13 If the person responds in the affirmative, the bill requires
  6 14 the peace officer to stop the body camera recording.  The bill
  6 15 also requires the peace officer to record the question and any
  6 16 answer to the question.
  6 17    If a peace officer wearing a body camera interacts with a
  6 18 person reporting a crime, providing information regarding a
  6 19 crime or ongoing investigation, or claiming to be a victim of a
  6 20 crime, the bill requires the peace officer to immediately ask
  6 21 whether the person desires the peace officer to stop the body
  6 22 camera recording of the interaction.  If the person responds in
  6 23 the affirmative, the bill requires the peace officer to stop
  6 24 the body camera recording.  The bill also requires the peace
  6 25 officer to record the question and any answer to the question.
  6 26    The contents of a recording created by a body camera are
  6 27 confidential except as provided for in the bill.
  6 28    The bill requires that an agency shall retain the contents
  6 29 of a recording created by a body camera for 30 days.  However,
  6 30 an agency shall retain the contents of a recording created by
  6 31 a body camera for three years if any of the following apply:
  6 32 the recording depicts an incident involving the use of force;
  6 33 the recording depicts an incident that leads to detention or
  6 34 arrest of a person; the recording is relevant to a formal
  6 35 or informal complaint against a peace officer or agency; or
  7  1 a request has been made to retain the recording.  Under the
  7  2 bill, the contents of the recording may be retained even longer
  7  3 than three years if the contents may be relevant to a criminal
  7  4 prosecution.
  7  5    Any of the following persons may make a request that the
  7  6 contents of a recording created by a body camera be retained
  7  7 for three years: a person who is a part of the content of the
  7  8 recording; a person whose property has been seized or damaged
  7  9 in relation to, or is otherwise involved with, a crime that is
  7 10 related to the recording; a parent or guardian of a person who
  7 11 is part of the content of the recording or whose property was
  7 12 seized, damaged, or involved with a crime that is related to
  7 13 the recording; the attorney for a person who is part of the
  7 14 content of the recording or whose property was seized, damaged,
  7 15 or involved with a crime that is related to the recording; any
  7 16 other person if such person has been given written authority
  7 17 to disclose the contents of the recording by the person who
  7 18 is part of the content of the recording or whose property was
  7 19 seized or damaged.
  7 20    The bill provides that a person, who is not a part of the
  7 21 content of a recording created by a body camera, may request a
  7 22 copy of and receive such recording if each person who is part
  7 23 of the content of the recording consents in writing.
  7 24    Prior to deleting or disposing of the contents of a recording
  7 25 created by a body camera, the bill requires the person who has
  7 26 the responsibility of deleting or disposing of such a recording
  7 27 on behalf of the agency, to review all applicable and available
  7 28 records, files, and databases to ascertain whether any reason
  7 29 exists that the recording should not be disposed of or deleted.
  7 30    A peace officer who fails to record any interaction with
  7 31 a person or who fails to stop recording such interaction
  7 32 as required by the bill commits a violation. For a first
  7 33 violation of the bill a peace officer shall be given a written
  7 34 reprimand.  For a second or subsequent violation of the bill
  7 35 the peace officer shall be suspended until an investigation
  8  1 into the cause of the violation has been completed.
  8  2    The bill also provides that if an agency is unable to produce
  8  3 a body camera recording during a criminal prosecution or civil
  8  4 action, a rebuttable presumption arises that the recording
  8  5 would corroborate the version of the facts advanced by the
  8  6 defendant in the criminal action or the party opposing the
  8  7 peace officer or agency in the civil action.
  8  8    The bill specifies that an agency shall participate in any
  8  9 existing state or federal programs that fund or supplement
  8 10 the costs to purchase and maintain body cameras worn by peace
  8 11 officers.
  8 12    The bill may include a state mandate as defined in Code
  8 13 section 25B.3.  The bill makes inapplicable Code section 25B.2,
  8 14 subsection 3, which would relieve a political subdivision from
  8 15 complying with a state mandate if funding for the cost of
  8 16 the state mandate is not provided or specified.  Therefore,
  8 17 political subdivisions are required to comply with any state
  8 18 mandate included in the bill.

  7 13 the recording; the attorney for a person who is part of the
  7 14 content of the recording or whose property was seized, damaged,
  7 15 or involved with a crime that is related to the recording; any
  7 16 other person if such person has been given written authority
  7 17 to disclose the contents of the recording by the person who
  7 18 is part of the content of the recording or whose property was
  7 19 seized or damaged.
  7 20    The bill provides that a person, who is not a part of the
  7 21 content of a recording created by a body camera, may request a
  7 22 copy of and receive such recording if each person who is part
  7 23 of the content of the recording consents in writing.
  7 24    Prior to deleting or disposing of the contents of a recording
  7 25 created by a body camera, the bill requires the person who has
  7 26 the responsibility of deleting or disposing of such a recording
  7 27 on behalf of the agency, to review all applicable and available
  7 28 records, files, and databases to ascertain whether any reason
  7 29 exists that the recording should not be disposed of or deleted.
  7 30    A peace officer who fails to record any interaction with
  7 31 a person or who fails to stop recording such interaction
  7 32 as required by the bill commits a violation. For a first
  7 33 violation of the bill a peace officer shall be given a written
  7 34 reprimand.  For a second or subsequent violation of the bill
  7 35 the peace officer shall be suspended until an investigation
  8  1 into the cause of the violation has been completed.
  8  2    The bill also provides that if an agency is unable to produce
  8  3 a body camera recording during a criminal prosecution or civil
  8  4 action, a rebuttable presumption arises that the recording
  8  5 would corroborate the version of the facts advanced by the
  8  6 defendant in the criminal action or the party opposing the
  8  7 peace officer or agency in the civil action.
  8  8    The bill specifies that an agency shall participate in any
  8  9 existing state or federal programs that fund or supplement
  8 10 the costs to purchase and maintain body cameras worn by peace
  8 11 officers.
  8 12    The bill may include a state mandate as defined in Code
  8 13 section 25B.3.  The bill makes inapplicable Code section 25B.2,
  8 14 subsection 3, which would relieve a political subdivision from
  8 15 complying with a state mandate if funding for the cost of
  8 16 the state mandate is not provided or specified.  Therefore,
  8 17 political subdivisions are required to comply with any state
  8 18 mandate included in the bill.

  5  5 action or the party opposing the peace officer or agency in the
  5  6 civil action.

  5 12                           EXPLANATION
  5 13 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  5 14 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  5 15    This bill requires certain peace officers, including tribal
  5 16 law enforcement officers, to wear a body camera.
  5 17    The bill defines "agency" to mean a law enforcement agency.
  5 18    The bill defines "body camera" to mean an electronic device
  5 19 that is capable of recording video and audio data or capable of
  5 20 transmitting video and audio data to be recorded remotely, and
  5 21 is worn on the person of a peace officer.
  5 22    The body camera requirement applies to a county sheriff
  5 23 or deputy sheriff, city peace officer, peace officer member
  5 24 of the department of public safety, peace officer at a
  5 25 regents institution, conservation officer, an employee of the
  5 26 department of transportation designated as a peace officer,
  5 27 an employee of an aviation authority designated as a peace
  5 28 officer, and a certified tribal law enforcement officer.
  5 29    The bill requires a peace officer to wear a body camera
  5 30 at all times while on duty and in uniform.  The bill further
  5 31 requires that the peace officer record all interactions with
  5 32 people in the performance of the official duties of the peace
  5 33 officer from the beginning to the end of those interactions.
  5 34    The bill specifies that a body camera must be worn on the
  5 35 chest or at the eye level of the peace officer.
  6  1 The bill prohibits a body camera from containing facial
  6  2 recognition technology unless the use of such technology has
  6  3 been authorized by the court pursuant to an arrest or search
  6  4 warrant.
  6  5    The bill requires a peace officer to inform a person when
  6  6 that person is being recorded by a body camera unless informing
  6  7 the person would be unsafe, impractical, or impossible.
  6  8    If a peace officer who is wearing a body camera enters a
  6  9 residence without a warrant or where no exigent circumstances
  6 10 exist, the bill requires that the peace officer immediately ask
  6 11 whether the resident desires the peace officer to stop the body
  6 12 camera recording while the peace officer is in the residence.
  6 13 If the person responds in the affirmative, the bill requires
  6 14 the peace officer to stop the body camera recording.  The bill
  6 15 also requires the peace officer to record the question and any
  6 16 answer to the question.
  6 17    If a peace officer wearing a body camera interacts with a
  6 18 person reporting a crime, providing information regarding a
  6 19 crime or ongoing investigation, or claiming to be a victim of a
  6 20 crime, the bill requires the peace officer to immediately ask
  6 21 whether the person desires the peace officer to stop the body
  6 22 camera recording of the interaction.  If the person responds in
  6 23 the affirmative, the bill requires the peace officer to stop
  6 24 the body camera recording.  The bill also requires the peace
  6 25 officer to record the question and any answer to the question.
  6 26    The contents of a recording created by a body camera are
  6 27 confidential except as provided for in the bill.
  6 28    The bill requires that an agency shall retain the contents
  6 29 of a recording created by a body camera for 30 days.  However,
  6 30 an agency shall retain the contents of a recording created by
  6 31 a body camera for three years if any of the following apply:
  6 32 the recording depicts an incident involving the use of force;
  6 33 the recording depicts an incident that leads to detention or
  6 34 arrest of a person; the recording is relevant to a formal
  6 35 or informal complaint against a peace officer or agency; or
  7  1 a request has been made to retain the recording.  Under the
  7  2 bill, the contents of the recording may be retained even longer
  7  3 than three years if the contents may be relevant to a criminal
  7  4 prosecution.
  7  5    Any of the following persons may make a request that the
  7  6 contents of a recording created by a body camera be retained
  7  7 for three years: a person who is a part of the content of the
  7  8 recording; a person whose property has been seized or damaged
  7  9 in relation to, or is otherwise involved with, a crime that is
  7 10 related to the recording; a parent or guardian of a person who
  7 11 is part of the content of the recording or whose property was
  7 12 seized, damaged, or involved with a crime that is related to
  7 13 the recording; the attorney for a person who is part of the
  7 14 content of the recording or whose property was seized, damaged,
  7 15 or involved with a crime that is related to the recording; any
  7 16 other person if such person has been given written authority
  7 17 to disclose the contents of the recording by the person who
  7 18 is part of the content of the recording or whose property was
  7 19 seized or damaged.
  7 20    The bill provides that a person, who is not a part of the
  7 21 content of a recording created by a body camera, may request a
  7 22 copy of and receive such recording if each person who is part
  7 23 of the content of the recording consents in writing.
  7 24    Prior to deleting or disposing of the contents of a recording
  7 25 created by a body camera, the bill requires the person who has
  7 26 the responsibility of deleting or disposing of such a recording
  7 27 on behalf of the agency, to review all applicable and available
  7 28 records, files, and databases to ascertain whether any reason
  7 29 exists that the recording should not be disposed of or deleted.
  7 30    A peace officer who fails to record any interaction with
  7 31 a person or who fails to stop recording such interaction
  7 32 as required by the bill commits a violation. For a first
  7 33 violation of the bill a peace officer shall be given a written
  7 34 reprimand.  For a second or subsequent violation of the bill
  7 35 the peace officer shall be suspended until an investigation
  8  1 into the cause of the violation has been completed.
  8  2    The bill also provides that if an agency is unable to produce
  8  3 a body camera recording during a criminal prosecution or civil
  8  4 action, a rebuttable presumption arises that the recording
  8  5 would corroborate the version of the facts advanced by the
  8  6 defendant in the criminal action or the party opposing the
  8  7 peace officer or agency in the civil action.
  8  8    The bill specifies that an agency shall participate in any
  8  9 existing state or federal programs that fund or supplement
  8 10 the costs to purchase and maintain body cameras worn by peace
  8 11 officers.
  8 12    The bill may include a state mandate as defined in Code
  8 13 section 25B.3.  The bill makes inapplicable Code section 25B.2,
  8 14 subsection 3, which would relieve a political subdivision from
  8 15 complying with a state mandate if funding for the cost of
  8 16 the state mandate is not provided or specified.  Therefore,
  8 17 political subdivisions are required to comply with any state
  8 18 mandate included in the bill.

  5 12                           EXPLANATION
  5 13 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  5 14 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  5 15    This bill requires certain peace officers, including tribal
  5 16 law enforcement officers, to wear a body camera.
  5 17    The bill defines "agency" to mean a law enforcement agency.
  5 18    The bill defines "body camera" to mean an electronic device
  5 19 that is capable of recording video and audio data or capable of
  5 20 transmitting video and audio data to be recorded remotely, and

  5 22    The body camera requirement applies to a county sheriff
  5 23 or deputy sheriff, city peace officer, peace officer member
  5 24 of the department of public safety, peace officer at a
  5 25 regents institution, conservation officer, an employee of the

  5 28 officer, and a certified tribal law enforcement officer.
  5 29    The bill requires a peace officer to wear a body camera
  5 30 at all times while on duty and in uniform.  The bill further
  5 31 requires that the peace officer record all interactions with

  5 33 officer from the beginning to the end of those interactions.
  5 34    The bill specifies that a body camera must be worn on the

  6  1 The bill prohibits a body camera from containing facial

  6  5    The bill requires a peace officer to inform a person when
  6  6 that person is being recorded by a body camera unless informing
  6  7 the person would be unsafe, impractical, or impossible.
  6  8    If a peace officer who is wearing a body camera enters a
  6  9 residence without a warrant or where no exigent circumstances
  6 10 exist, the bill requires that the peace officer immediately ask
  6 11 whether the resident desires the peace officer to stop the body
  6 12 camera recording while the peace officer is in the residence.
  6 13 If the person responds in the affirmative, the bill requires
  6 14 the peace officer to stop the body camera recording.  The bill
  6 15 also requires the peace officer to record the question and any
  6 16 answer to the question.

  6 20 crime, the bill requires the peace officer to immediately ask

  6 22 camera recording of the interaction.  If the person responds in
  6 23 the affirmative, the bill requires the peace officer to stop
  6 24 the body camera recording.  The bill also requires the peace
  6 25 officer to record the question and any answer to the question.
  6 26    The contents of a recording created by a body camera are
  6 27 confidential except as provided for in the bill.
  6 28    The bill requires that an agency shall retain the contents
  6 29 of a recording created by a body camera for 30 days.  However,
  6 30 an agency shall retain the contents of a recording created by
  6 31 a body camera for three years if any of the following apply:
  6 32 the recording depicts an incident involving the use of force;
  6 33 the recording depicts an incident that leads to detention or
  6 34 arrest of a person; the recording is relevant to a formal
  6 35 or informal complaint against a peace officer or agency; or
  7  1 a request has been made to retain the recording.  Under the
  7  2 bill, the contents of the recording may be retained even longer
  7  3 than three years if the contents may be relevant to a criminal
  7  4 prosecution.
  7  5    Any of the following persons may make a request that the
  7  6 contents of a recording created by a body camera be retained
  7  7 for three years: a person who is a part of the content of the
  7  8 recording; a person whose property has been seized or damaged
  7  9 in relation to, or is otherwise involved with, a crime that is
  7 10 related to the recording; a parent or guardian of a person who
  7 11 is part of the content of the recording or whose property was
  7 12 seized, damaged, or involved with a crime that is related to
  7 13 the recording; the attorney for a person who is part of the
  7 14 content of the recording or whose property was seized, damaged,
  7 15 or involved with a crime that is related to the recording; any
  7 16 other person if such person has been given written authority
  7 17 to disclose the contents of the recording by the person who
  7 18 is part of the content of the recording or whose property was
  7 19 seized or damaged.
  7 20    The bill provides that a person, who is not a part of the
  7 21 content of a recording created by a body camera, may request a
  7 22 copy of and receive such recording if each person who is part
  7 23 of the content of the recording consents in writing.
  7 24    Prior to deleting or disposing of the contents of a recording
  7 25 created by a body camera, the bill requires the person who has
  7 26 the responsibility of deleting or disposing of such a recording
  7 27 on behalf of the agency, to review all applicable and available
  7 28 records, files, and databases to ascertain whether any reason
  7 29 exists that the recording should not be disposed of or deleted.
  7 30    A peace officer who fails to record any interaction with
  7 31 a person or who fails to stop recording such interaction
  7 32 as required by the bill commits a violation. For a first
  7 33 violation of the bill a peace officer shall be given a written
  7 34 reprimand.  For a second or subsequent violation of the bill
  7 35 the peace officer shall be suspended until an investigation
  8  1 into the cause of the violation has been completed.
  8  2    The bill also provides that if an agency is unable to produce
  8  3 a body camera recording during a criminal prosecution or civil
  8  4 action, a rebuttable presumption arises that the recording
  8  5 would corroborate the version of the facts advanced by the
  8  6 defendant in the criminal action or the party opposing the
  8  7 peace officer or agency in the civil action.
  8  8    The bill specifies that an agency shall participate in any
  8  9 existing state or federal programs that fund or supplement
  8 10 the costs to purchase and maintain body cameras worn by peace
  8 11 officers.
  8 12    The bill may include a state mandate as defined in Code
  8 13 section 25B.3.  The bill makes inapplicable Code section 25B.2,
  8 14 subsection 3, which would relieve a political subdivision from
  8 15 complying with a state mandate if funding for the cost of
  8 16 the state mandate is not provided or specified.  Therefore,
  8 17 political subdivisions are required to comply with any state
  8 18 mandate included in the bill.

  4  3 relation to, or is otherwise involved with, a crime that is
  4  4 related to the recording.
  4  5    (c)  A parent or legal guardian of a person described in
  4  6 subparagraph division (a) or (b).
  4  7    (d)  An attorney for a person described in subparagraph

  4 23 exists that the recording should not be deleted or disposed of
  4 24 under this section or under the policies of the agency. The
  4 25 contents of such a recording shall not be deleted or disposed
  4 26 of if such a reason exists.

  5  6 civil action.
  5  7    9.  The agency shall participate in any existing state or

  5 12                           EXPLANATION
  5 13 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  5 14 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  5 15    This bill requires certain peace officers, including tribal
  5 16 law enforcement officers, to wear a body camera.
  5 17    The bill defines "agency" to mean a law enforcement agency.
  5 18    The bill defines "body camera" to mean an electronic device
  5 19 that is capable of recording video and audio data or capable of
  5 20 transmitting video and audio data to be recorded remotely, and
  5 21 is worn on the person of a peace officer.
  5 22    The body camera requirement applies to a county sheriff
  5 23 or deputy sheriff, city peace officer, peace officer member
  5 24 of the department of public safety, peace officer at a
  5 25 regents institution, conservation officer, an employee of the
  5 26 department of transportation designated as a peace officer,
  5 27 an employee of an aviation authority designated as a peace
  5 28 officer, and a certified tribal law enforcement officer.
  5 29    The bill requires a peace officer to wear a body camera
  5 30 at all times while on duty and in uniform.  The bill further
  5 31 requires that the peace officer record all interactions with
  5 32 people in the performance of the official duties of the peace
  5 33 officer from the beginning to the end of those interactions.
  5 34    The bill specifies that a body camera must be worn on the
  5 35 chest or at the eye level of the peace officer.
  6  1 The bill prohibits a body camera from containing facial
  6  2 recognition technology unless the use of such technology has
  6  3 been authorized by the court pursuant to an arrest or search
  6  4 warrant.
  6  5    The bill requires a peace officer to inform a person when
  6  6 that person is being recorded by a body camera unless informing
  6  7 the person would be unsafe, impractical, or impossible.
  6  8    If a peace officer who is wearing a body camera enters a
  6  9 residence without a warrant or where no exigent circumstances
  6 10 exist, the bill requires that the peace officer immediately ask
  6 11 whether the resident desires the peace officer to stop the body
  6 12 camera recording while the peace officer is in the residence.
  6 13 If the person responds in the affirmative, the bill requires
  6 14 the peace officer to stop the body camera recording.  The bill
  6 15 also requires the peace officer to record the question and any
  6 16 answer to the question.
  6 17    If a peace officer wearing a body camera interacts with a
  6 18 person reporting a crime, providing information regarding a
  6 19 crime or ongoing investigation, or claiming to be a victim of a
  6 20 crime, the bill requires the peace officer to immediately ask
  6 21 whether the person desires the peace officer to stop the body
  6 22 camera recording of the interaction.  If the person responds in
  6 23 the affirmative, the bill requires the peace officer to stop
  6 24 the body camera recording.  The bill also requires the peace
  6 25 officer to record the question and any answer to the question.
  6 26    The contents of a recording created by a body camera are
  6 27 confidential except as provided for in the bill.
  6 28    The bill requires that an agency shall retain the contents
  6 29 of a recording created by a body camera for 30 days.  However,
  6 30 an agency shall retain the contents of a recording created by
  6 31 a body camera for three years if any of the following apply:
  6 32 the recording depicts an incident involving the use of force;
  6 33 the recording depicts an incident that leads to detention or
  6 34 arrest of a person; the recording is relevant to a formal
  6 35 or informal complaint against a peace officer or agency; or
  7  1 a request has been made to retain the recording.  Under the
  7  2 bill, the contents of the recording may be retained even longer
  7  3 than three years if the contents may be relevant to a criminal
  7  4 prosecution.
  7  5    Any of the following persons may make a request that the
  7  6 contents of a recording created by a body camera be retained
  7  7 for three years: a person who is a part of the content of the
  7  8 recording; a person whose property has been seized or damaged
  7  9 in relation to, or is otherwise involved with, a crime that is
  7 10 related to the recording; a parent or guardian of a person who
  7 11 is part of the content of the recording or whose property was
  7 12 seized, damaged, or involved with a crime that is related to
  7 13 the recording; the attorney for a person who is part of the
  7 14 content of the recording or whose property was seized, damaged,
  7 15 or involved with a crime that is related to the recording; any
  7 16 other person if such person has been given written authority
  7 17 to disclose the contents of the recording by the person who
  7 18 is part of the content of the recording or whose property was
  7 19 seized or damaged.
  7 20    The bill provides that a person, who is not a part of the
  7 21 content of a recording created by a body camera, may request a
  7 22 copy of and receive such recording if each person who is part
  7 23 of the content of the recording consents in writing.
  7 24    Prior to deleting or disposing of the contents of a recording
  7 25 created by a body camera, the bill requires the person who has
  7 26 the responsibility of deleting or disposing of such a recording
  7 27 on behalf of the agency, to review all applicable and available
  7 28 records, files, and databases to ascertain whether any reason
  7 29 exists that the recording should not be disposed of or deleted.
  7 30    A peace officer who fails to record any interaction with
  7 31 a person or who fails to stop recording such interaction
  7 32 as required by the bill commits a violation. For a first
  7 33 violation of the bill a peace officer shall be given a written
  7 34 reprimand.  For a second or subsequent violation of the bill
  7 35 the peace officer shall be suspended until an investigation
  8  1 into the cause of the violation has been completed.
  8  2    The bill also provides that if an agency is unable to produce
  8  3 a body camera recording during a criminal prosecution or civil
  8  4 action, a rebuttable presumption arises that the recording
  8  5 would corroborate the version of the facts advanced by the
  8  6 defendant in the criminal action or the party opposing the
  8  7 peace officer or agency in the civil action.
  8  8    The bill specifies that an agency shall participate in any
  8  9 existing state or federal programs that fund or supplement
  8 10 the costs to purchase and maintain body cameras worn by peace
  8 11 officers.
  8 12    The bill may include a state mandate as defined in Code
  8 13 section 25B.3.  The bill makes inapplicable Code section 25B.2,
  8 14 subsection 3, which would relieve a political subdivision from
  8 15 complying with a state mandate if funding for the cost of
  8 16 the state mandate is not provided or specified.  Therefore,
  8 17 political subdivisions are required to comply with any state
  8 18 mandate included in the bill.

  5 12                           EXPLANATION
  5 13 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  5 14 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  5 15    This bill requires certain peace officers, including tribal
  5 16 law enforcement officers, to wear a body camera.
  5 17    The bill defines "agency" to mean a law enforcement agency.
  5 18    The bill defines "body camera" to mean an electronic device
  5 19 that is capable of recording video and audio data or capable of
  5 20 transmitting video and audio data to be recorded remotely, and
  5 21 is worn on the person of a peace officer.
  5 22    The body camera requirement applies to a county sheriff

  5 24 of the department of public safety, peace officer at a
  5 25 regents institution, conservation officer, an employee of the

  5 28 officer, and a certified tribal law enforcement officer.
  5 29    The bill requires a peace officer to wear a body camera
  5 30 at all times while on duty and in uniform.  The bill further
  5 31 requires that the peace officer record all interactions with
  5 32 people in the performance of the official duties of the peace
  5 33 officer from the beginning to the end of those interactions.
  5 34    The bill specifies that a body camera must be worn on the
  5 35 chest or at the eye level of the peace officer.
  6  1 The bill prohibits a body camera from containing facial

  6  5    The bill requires a peace officer to inform a person when
  6  6 that person is being recorded by a body camera unless informing
  6  7 the person would be unsafe, impractical, or impossible.
  6  8    If a peace officer who is wearing a body camera enters a
  6  9 residence without a warrant or where no exigent circumstances
  6 10 exist, the bill requires that the peace officer immediately ask
  6 11 whether the resident desires the peace officer to stop the body
  6 12 camera recording while the peace officer is in the residence.
  6 13 If the person responds in the affirmative, the bill requires
  6 14 the peace officer to stop the body camera recording.  The bill
  6 15 also requires the peace officer to record the question and any
  6 16 answer to the question.
  6 17    If a peace officer wearing a body camera interacts with a
  6 18 person reporting a crime, providing information regarding a

  6 20 crime, the bill requires the peace officer to immediately ask

  6 22 camera recording of the interaction.  If the person responds in
  6 23 the affirmative, the bill requires the peace officer to stop
  6 24 the body camera recording.  The bill also requires the peace
  6 25 officer to record the question and any answer to the question.
  6 26    The contents of a recording created by a body camera are
  6 27 confidential except as provided for in the bill.
  6 28    The bill requires that an agency shall retain the contents
  6 29 of a recording created by a body camera for 30 days.  However,
  6 30 an agency shall retain the contents of a recording created by
  6 31 a body camera for three years if any of the following apply:
  6 32 the recording depicts an incident involving the use of force;
  6 33 the recording depicts an incident that leads to detention or
  6 34 arrest of a person; the recording is relevant to a formal
  6 35 or informal complaint against a peace officer or agency; or
  7  1 a request has been made to retain the recording.  Under the
  7  2 bill, the contents of the recording may be retained even longer
  7  3 than three years if the contents may be relevant to a criminal
  7  4 prosecution.
  7  5    Any of the following persons may make a request that the
  7  6 contents of a recording created by a body camera be retained
  7  7 for three years: a person who is a part of the content of the
  7  8 recording; a person whose property has been seized or damaged
  7  9 in relation to, or is otherwise involved with, a crime that is
  7 10 related to the recording; a parent or guardian of a person who
  7 11 is part of the content of the recording or whose property was
  7 12 seized, damaged, or involved with a crime that is related to
  7 13 the recording; the attorney for a person who is part of the
  7 14 content of the recording or whose property was seized, damaged,
  7 15 or involved with a crime that is related to the recording; any
  7 16 other person if such person has been given written authority
  7 17 to disclose the contents of the recording by the person who
  7 18 is part of the content of the recording or whose property was
  7 19 seized or damaged.
  7 20    The bill provides that a person, who is not a part of the
  7 21 content of a recording created by a body camera, may request a
  7 22 copy of and receive such recording if each person who is part
  7 23 of the content of the recording consents in writing.
  7 24    Prior to deleting or disposing of the contents of a recording
  7 25 created by a body camera, the bill requires the person who has
  7 26 the responsibility of deleting or disposing of such a recording
  7 27 on behalf of the agency, to review all applicable and available
  7 28 records, files, and databases to ascertain whether any reason
  7 29 exists that the recording should not be disposed of or deleted.
  7 30    A peace officer who fails to record any interaction with
  7 31 a person or who fails to stop recording such interaction
  7 32 as required by the bill commits a violation. For a first
  7 33 violation of the bill a peace officer shall be given a written
  7 34 reprimand.  For a second or subsequent violation of the bill
  7 35 the peace officer shall be suspended until an investigation
  8  1 into the cause of the violation has been completed.
  8  2    The bill also provides that if an agency is unable to produce
  8  3 a body camera recording during a criminal prosecution or civil
  8  4 action, a rebuttable presumption arises that the recording
  8  5 would corroborate the version of the facts advanced by the
  8  6 defendant in the criminal action or the party opposing the
  8  7 peace officer or agency in the civil action.
  8  8    The bill specifies that an agency shall participate in any
  8  9 existing state or federal programs that fund or supplement
  8 10 the costs to purchase and maintain body cameras worn by peace
  8 11 officers.
  8 12    The bill may include a state mandate as defined in Code
  8 13 section 25B.3.  The bill makes inapplicable Code section 25B.2,
  8 14 subsection 3, which would relieve a political subdivision from
  8 15 complying with a state mandate if funding for the cost of
  8 16 the state mandate is not provided or specified.  Therefore,
  8 17 political subdivisions are required to comply with any state
  8 18 mandate included in the bill.

  5 13 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  5 14 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  5 15    This bill requires certain peace officers, including tribal
  5 16 law enforcement officers, to wear a body camera.
  5 17    The bill defines "agency" to mean a law enforcement agency.
  5 18    The bill defines "body camera" to mean an electronic device
  5 19 that is capable of recording video and audio data or capable of
  5 20 transmitting video and audio data to be recorded remotely, and

  5 26 department of transportation designated as a peace officer,
  5 27 an employee of an aviation authority designated as a peace
  5 28 officer, and a certified tribal law enforcement officer.
  5 29    The bill requires a peace officer to wear a body camera
  5 30 at all times while on duty and in uniform.  The bill further
  5 31 requires that the peace officer record all interactions with
  5 32 people in the performance of the official duties of the peace
  5 33 officer from the beginning to the end of those interactions.
  5 34    The bill specifies that a body camera must be worn on the
  5 35 chest or at the eye level of the peace officer.
  6  1 The bill prohibits a body camera from containing facial
  6  2 recognition technology unless the use of such technology has
  6  3 been authorized by the court pursuant to an arrest or search
  6  4 warrant.
  6  5    The bill requires a peace officer to inform a person when
  6  6 that person is being recorded by a body camera unless informing
  6  7 the person would be unsafe, impractical, or impossible.
  6  8    If a peace officer who is wearing a body camera enters a
  6  9 residence without a warrant or where no exigent circumstances
  6 10 exist, the bill requires that the peace officer immediately ask
  6 11 whether the resident desires the peace officer to stop the body
  6 12 camera recording while the peace officer is in the residence.
  6 13 If the person responds in the affirmative, the bill requires
  6 14 the peace officer to stop the body camera recording.  The bill
  6 15 also requires the peace officer to record the question and any
  6 16 answer to the question.
  6 17    If a peace officer wearing a body camera interacts with a
  6 18 person reporting a crime, providing information regarding a
  6 19 crime or ongoing investigation, or claiming to be a victim of a
  6 20 crime, the bill requires the peace officer to immediately ask
  6 21 whether the person desires the peace officer to stop the body
  6 22 camera recording of the interaction.  If the person responds in
  6 23 the affirmative, the bill requires the peace officer to stop
  6 24 the body camera recording.  The bill also requires the peace
  6 25 officer to record the question and any answer to the question.
  6 26    The contents of a recording created by a body camera are
  6 27 confidential except as provided for in the bill.
  6 28    The bill requires that an agency shall retain the contents
  6 29 of a recording created by a body camera for 30 days.  However,
  6 30 an agency shall retain the contents of a recording created by
  6 31 a body camera for three years if any of the following apply:
  6 32 the recording depicts an incident involving the use of force;
  6 33 the recording depicts an incident that leads to detention or
  6 34 arrest of a person; the recording is relevant to a formal
  6 35 or informal complaint against a peace officer or agency; or
  7  1 a request has been made to retain the recording.  Under the
  7  2 bill, the contents of the recording may be retained even longer
  7  3 than three years if the contents may be relevant to a criminal
  7  4 prosecution.
  7  5    Any of the following persons may make a request that the
  7  6 contents of a recording created by a body camera be retained
  7  7 for three years: a person who is a part of the content of the
  7  8 recording; a person whose property has been seized or damaged
  7  9 in relation to, or is otherwise involved with, a crime that is
  7 10 related to the recording; a parent or guardian of a person who
  7 11 is part of the content of the recording or whose property was
  7 12 seized, damaged, or involved with a crime that is related to
  7 13 the recording; the attorney for a person who is part of the
  7 14 content of the recording or whose property was seized, damaged,
  7 15 or involved with a crime that is related to the recording; any
  7 16 other person if such person has been given written authority
  7 17 to disclose the contents of the recording by the person who
  7 18 is part of the content of the recording or whose property was
  7 19 seized or damaged.
  7 20    The bill provides that a person, who is not a part of the
  7 21 content of a recording created by a body camera, may request a
  7 22 copy of and receive such recording if each person who is part
  7 23 of the content of the recording consents in writing.
  7 24    Prior to deleting or disposing of the contents of a recording
  7 25 created by a body camera, the bill requires the person who has
  7 26 the responsibility of deleting or disposing of such a recording
  7 27 on behalf of the agency, to review all applicable and available
  7 28 records, files, and databases to ascertain whether any reason
  7 29 exists that the recording should not be disposed of or deleted.
  7 30    A peace officer who fails to record any interaction with
  7 31 a person or who fails to stop recording such interaction
  7 32 as required by the bill commits a violation. For a first
  7 33 violation of the bill a peace officer shall be given a written
  7 34 reprimand.  For a second or subsequent violation of the bill
  7 35 the peace officer shall be suspended until an investigation
  8  1 into the cause of the violation has been completed.
  8  2    The bill also provides that if an agency is unable to produce
  8  3 a body camera recording during a criminal prosecution or civil
  8  4 action, a rebuttable presumption arises that the recording
  8  5 would corroborate the version of the facts advanced by the
  8  6 defendant in the criminal action or the party opposing the
  8  7 peace officer or agency in the civil action.
  8  8    The bill specifies that an agency shall participate in any
  8  9 existing state or federal programs that fund or supplement
  8 10 the costs to purchase and maintain body cameras worn by peace
  8 11 officers.
  8 12    The bill may include a state mandate as defined in Code
  8 13 section 25B.3.  The bill makes inapplicable Code section 25B.2,
  8 14 subsection 3, which would relieve a political subdivision from
  8 15 complying with a state mandate if funding for the cost of
  8 16 the state mandate is not provided or specified.  Therefore,
  8 17 political subdivisions are required to comply with any state
  8 18 mandate included in the bill.

  5 12                           EXPLANATION
  5 13 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  5 14 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  5 15    This bill requires certain peace officers, including tribal
  5 16 law enforcement officers, to wear a body camera.
  5 17    The bill defines "agency" to mean a law enforcement agency.
  5 18    The bill defines "body camera" to mean an electronic device
  5 19 that is capable of recording video and audio data or capable of
  5 20 transmitting video and audio data to be recorded remotely, and
  5 21 is worn on the person of a peace officer.
  5 22    The body camera requirement applies to a county sheriff
  5 23 or deputy sheriff, city peace officer, peace officer member
  5 24 of the department of public safety, peace officer at a
  5 25 regents institution, conservation officer, an employee of the

  5 29    The bill requires a peace officer to wear a body camera
  5 30 at all times while on duty and in uniform.  The bill further
  5 31 requires that the peace officer record all interactions with
  5 32 people in the performance of the official duties of the peace
  5 33 officer from the beginning to the end of those interactions.
  5 34    The bill specifies that a body camera must be worn on the
  5 35 chest or at the eye level of the peace officer.
  6  1 The bill prohibits a body camera from containing facial
  6  2 recognition technology unless the use of such technology has
  6  3 been authorized by the court pursuant to an arrest or search
  6  4 warrant.
  6  5    The bill requires a peace officer to inform a person when
  6  6 that person is being recorded by a body camera unless informing
  6  7 the person would be unsafe, impractical, or impossible.
  6  8    If a peace officer who is wearing a body camera enters a
  6  9 residence without a warrant or where no exigent circumstances
  6 10 exist, the bill requires that the peace officer immediately ask
  6 11 whether the resident desires the peace officer to stop the body
  6 12 camera recording while the peace officer is in the residence.
  6 13 If the person responds in the affirmative, the bill requires
  6 14 the peace officer to stop the body camera recording.  The bill
  6 15 also requires the peace officer to record the question and any
  6 16 answer to the question.

  6 22 camera recording of the interaction.  If the person responds in
  6 23 the affirmative, the bill requires the peace officer to stop
  6 24 the body camera recording.  The bill also requires the peace
  6 25 officer to record the question and any answer to the question.
  6 26    The contents of a recording created by a body camera are
  6 27 confidential except as provided for in the bill.
  6 28    The bill requires that an agency shall retain the contents
  6 29 of a recording created by a body camera for 30 days.  However,
  6 30 an agency shall retain the contents of a recording created by
  6 31 a body camera for three years if any of the following apply:
  6 32 the recording depicts an incident involving the use of force;
  6 33 the recording depicts an incident that leads to detention or
  6 34 arrest of a person; the recording is relevant to a formal
  6 35 or informal complaint against a peace officer or agency; or
  7  1 a request has been made to retain the recording.  Under the
  7  2 bill, the contents of the recording may be retained even longer
  7  3 than three years if the contents may be relevant to a criminal
  7  4 prosecution.
  7  5    Any of the following persons may make a request that the
  7  6 contents of a recording created by a body camera be retained
  7  7 for three years: a person who is a part of the content of the
  7  8 recording; a person whose property has been seized or damaged
  7  9 in relation to, or is otherwise involved with, a crime that is
  7 10 related to the recording; a parent or guardian of a person who
  7 11 is part of the content of the recording or whose property was
  7 12 seized, damaged, or involved with a crime that is related to
  7 13 the recording; the attorney for a person who is part of the
  7 14 content of the recording or whose property was seized, damaged,
  7 15 or involved with a crime that is related to the recording; any

  7 17 to disclose the contents of the recording by the person who
  7 18 is part of the content of the recording or whose property was
  7 19 seized or damaged.
  7 20    The bill provides that a person, who is not a part of the
  7 21 content of a recording created by a body camera, may request a
  7 22 copy of and receive such recording if each person who is part
  7 23 of the content of the recording consents in writing.
  7 24    Prior to deleting or disposing of the contents of a recording
  7 25 created by a body camera, the bill requires the person who has
  7 26 the responsibility of deleting or disposing of such a recording
  7 27 on behalf of the agency, to review all applicable and available
  7 28 records, files, and databases to ascertain whether any reason
  7 29 exists that the recording should not be disposed of or deleted.
  7 30    A peace officer who fails to record any interaction with
  7 31 a person or who fails to stop recording such interaction
  7 32 as required by the bill commits a violation. For a first
  7 33 violation of the bill a peace officer shall be given a written
  7 34 reprimand.  For a second or subsequent violation of the bill
  7 35 the peace officer shall be suspended until an investigation
  8  1 into the cause of the violation has been completed.
  8  2    The bill also provides that if an agency is unable to produce
  8  3 a body camera recording during a criminal prosecution or civil
  8  4 action, a rebuttable presumption arises that the recording
  8  5 would corroborate the version of the facts advanced by the
  8  6 defendant in the criminal action or the party opposing the
  8  7 peace officer or agency in the civil action.
  8  8    The bill specifies that an agency shall participate in any
  8  9 existing state or federal programs that fund or supplement
  8 10 the costs to purchase and maintain body cameras worn by peace
  8 11 officers.
  8 12    The bill may include a state mandate as defined in Code
  8 13 section 25B.3.  The bill makes inapplicable Code section 25B.2,
  8 14 subsection 3, which would relieve a political subdivision from
  8 15 complying with a state mandate if funding for the cost of
  8 16 the state mandate is not provided or specified.  Therefore,
  8 17 political subdivisions are required to comply with any state
  8 18 mandate included in the bill.

  7 24    Prior to deleting or disposing of the contents of a recording
  7 25 created by a body camera, the bill requires the person who has
  7 26 the responsibility of deleting or disposing of such a recording
  7 27 on behalf of the agency, to review all applicable and available
  7 28 records, files, and databases to ascertain whether any reason
  7 29 exists that the recording should not be disposed of or deleted.
  7 30    A peace officer who fails to record any interaction with
  7 31 a person or who fails to stop recording such interaction
  7 32 as required by the bill commits a violation. For a first
  7 33 violation of the bill a peace officer shall be given a written
  7 34 reprimand.  For a second or subsequent violation of the bill
  7 35 the peace officer shall be suspended until an investigation
  8  1 into the cause of the violation has been completed.
  8  2    The bill also provides that if an agency is unable to produce
  8  3 a body camera recording during a criminal prosecution or civil
  8  4 action, a rebuttable presumption arises that the recording
  8  5 would corroborate the version of the facts advanced by the
  8  6 defendant in the criminal action or the party opposing the
  8  7 peace officer or agency in the civil action.
  8  8    The bill specifies that an agency shall participate in any
  8  9 existing state or federal programs that fund or supplement
  8 10 the costs to purchase and maintain body cameras worn by peace
  8 11 officers.
  8 12    The bill may include a state mandate as defined in Code
  8 13 section 25B.3.  The bill makes inapplicable Code section 25B.2,
  8 14 subsection 3, which would relieve a political subdivision from
  8 15 complying with a state mandate if funding for the cost of
  8 16 the state mandate is not provided or specified.  Therefore,
  8 17 political subdivisions are required to comply with any state
  8 18 mandate included in the bill.

  5 12                           EXPLANATION
  5 13 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  5 14 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  5 15    This bill requires certain peace officers, including tribal
  5 16 law enforcement officers, to wear a body camera.
  5 17    The bill defines "agency" to mean a law enforcement agency.
  5 18    The bill defines "body camera" to mean an electronic device
  5 19 that is capable of recording video and audio data or capable of
  5 20 transmitting video and audio data to be recorded remotely, and
  5 21 is worn on the person of a peace officer.
  5 22    The body camera requirement applies to a county sheriff
  5 23 or deputy sheriff, city peace officer, peace officer member
  5 24 of the department of public safety, peace officer at a
  5 25 regents institution, conservation officer, an employee of the
  5 26 department of transportation designated as a peace officer,
  5 27 an employee of an aviation authority designated as a peace
  5 28 officer, and a certified tribal law enforcement officer.
  5 29    The bill requires a peace officer to wear a body camera
  5 30 at all times while on duty and in uniform.  The bill further
  5 31 requires that the peace officer record all interactions with
  5 32 people in the performance of the official duties of the peace
  5 33 officer from the beginning to the end of those interactions.
  5 34    The bill specifies that a body camera must be worn on the
  5 35 chest or at the eye level of the peace officer.
  6  1 The bill prohibits a body camera from containing facial
  6  2 recognition technology unless the use of such technology has
  6  3 been authorized by the court pursuant to an arrest or search
  6  4 warrant.
  6  5    The bill requires a peace officer to inform a person when
  6  6 that person is being recorded by a body camera unless informing
  6  7 the person would be unsafe, impractical, or impossible.
  6  8    If a peace officer who is wearing a body camera enters a
  6  9 residence without a warrant or where no exigent circumstances
  6 10 exist, the bill requires that the peace officer immediately ask
  6 11 whether the resident desires the peace officer to stop the body
  6 12 camera recording while the peace officer is in the residence.
  6 13 If the person responds in the affirmative, the bill requires
  6 14 the peace officer to stop the body camera recording.  The bill
  6 15 also requires the peace officer to record the question and any
  6 16 answer to the question.
  6 17    If a peace officer wearing a body camera interacts with a
  6 18 person reporting a crime, providing information regarding a
  6 19 crime or ongoing investigation, or claiming to be a victim of a
  6 20 crime, the bill requires the peace officer to immediately ask
  6 21 whether the person desires the peace officer to stop the body
  6 22 camera recording of the interaction.  If the person responds in
  6 23 the affirmative, the bill requires the peace officer to stop
  6 24 the body camera recording.  The bill also requires the peace
  6 25 officer to record the question and any answer to the question.
  6 26    The contents of a recording created by a body camera are
  6 27 confidential except as provided for in the bill.
  6 28    The bill requires that an agency shall retain the contents
  6 29 of a recording created by a body camera for 30 days.  However,
  6 30 an agency shall retain the contents of a recording created by
  6 31 a body camera for three years if any of the following apply:
  6 32 the recording depicts an incident involving the use of force;
  6 33 the recording depicts an incident that leads to detention or
  6 34 arrest of a person; the recording is relevant to a formal
  6 35 or informal complaint against a peace officer or agency; or
  7  1 a request has been made to retain the recording.  Under the
  7  2 bill, the contents of the recording may be retained even longer
  7  3 than three years if the contents may be relevant to a criminal
  7  4 prosecution.
  7  5    Any of the following persons may make a request that the
  7  6 contents of a recording created by a body camera be retained
  7  7 for three years: a person who is a part of the content of the
  7  8 recording; a person whose property has been seized or damaged
  7  9 in relation to, or is otherwise involved with, a crime that is
  7 10 related to the recording; a parent or guardian of a person who
  7 11 is part of the content of the recording or whose property was
  7 12 seized, damaged, or involved with a crime that is related to
  7 13 the recording; the attorney for a person who is part of the
  7 14 content of the recording or whose property was seized, damaged,
  7 15 or involved with a crime that is related to the recording; any
  7 16 other person if such person has been given written authority
  7 17 to disclose the contents of the recording by the person who
  7 18 is part of the content of the recording or whose property was
  7 19 seized or damaged.
  7 20    The bill provides that a person, who is not a part of the
  7 21 content of a recording created by a body camera, may request a
  7 22 copy of and receive such recording if each person who is part
  7 23 of the content of the recording consents in writing.
  7 24    Prior to deleting or disposing of the contents of a recording
  7 25 created by a body camera, the bill requires the person who has
  7 26 the responsibility of deleting or disposing of such a recording
  7 27 on behalf of the agency, to review all applicable and available
  7 28 records, files, and databases to ascertain whether any reason
  7 29 exists that the recording should not be disposed of or deleted.
  7 30    A peace officer who fails to record any interaction with
  7 31 a person or who fails to stop recording such interaction
  7 32 as required by the bill commits a violation. For a first
  7 33 violation of the bill a peace officer shall be given a written
  7 34 reprimand.  For a second or subsequent violation of the bill
  7 35 the peace officer shall be suspended until an investigation
  8  1 into the cause of the violation has been completed.
  8  2    The bill also provides that if an agency is unable to produce
  8  3 a body camera recording during a criminal prosecution or civil
  8  4 action, a rebuttable presumption arises that the recording
  8  5 would corroborate the version of the facts advanced by the
  8  6 defendant in the criminal action or the party opposing the
  8  7 peace officer or agency in the civil action.
  8  8    The bill specifies that an agency shall participate in any
  8  9 existing state or federal programs that fund or supplement
  8 10 the costs to purchase and maintain body cameras worn by peace
  8 11 officers.
  8 12    The bill may include a state mandate as defined in Code
  8 13 section 25B.3.  The bill makes inapplicable Code section 25B.2,
  8 14 subsection 3, which would relieve a political subdivision from
  8 15 complying with a state mandate if funding for the cost of
  8 16 the state mandate is not provided or specified.  Therefore,
  8 17 political subdivisions are required to comply with any state
  8 18 mandate included in the bill.

  4 35    8.  If an agency is unable to produce a body camera recording
  5  1 during a criminal prosecution or civil action which is required
  5  2 to be made and retained pursuant to this section, a rebuttable
  5  3 presumption arises that the recording would corroborate the

  5  5 action or the party opposing the peace officer or agency in the
  5  6 civil action.
  5  7    9.  The agency shall participate in any existing state or

  5 12                           EXPLANATION
  5 13 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  5 14 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  5 15    This bill requires certain peace officers, including tribal
  5 16 law enforcement officers, to wear a body camera.
  5 17    The bill defines "agency" to mean a law enforcement agency.
  5 18    The bill defines "body camera" to mean an electronic device
  5 19 that is capable of recording video and audio data or capable of
  5 20 transmitting video and audio data to be recorded remotely, and
  5 21 is worn on the person of a peace officer.
  5 22    The body camera requirement applies to a county sheriff
  5 23 or deputy sheriff, city peace officer, peace officer member
  5 24 of the department of public safety, peace officer at a
  5 25 regents institution, conservation officer, an employee of the
  5 26 department of transportation designated as a peace officer,
  5 27 an employee of an aviation authority designated as a peace
  5 28 officer, and a certified tribal law enforcement officer.
  5 29    The bill requires a peace officer to wear a body camera
  5 30 at all times while on duty and in uniform.  The bill further
  5 31 requires that the peace officer record all interactions with
  5 32 people in the performance of the official duties of the peace
  5 33 officer from the beginning to the end of those interactions.
  5 34    The bill specifies that a body camera must be worn on the
  5 35 chest or at the eye level of the peace officer.
  6  1 The bill prohibits a body camera from containing facial
  6  2 recognition technology unless the use of such technology has
  6  3 been authorized by the court pursuant to an arrest or search
  6  4 warrant.
  6  5    The bill requires a peace officer to inform a person when
  6  6 that person is being recorded by a body camera unless informing
  6  7 the person would be unsafe, impractical, or impossible.
  6  8    If a peace officer who is wearing a body camera enters a
  6  9 residence without a warrant or where no exigent circumstances
  6 10 exist, the bill requires that the peace officer immediately ask
  6 11 whether the resident desires the peace officer to stop the body
  6 12 camera recording while the peace officer is in the residence.
  6 13 If the person responds in the affirmative, the bill requires
  6 14 the peace officer to stop the body camera recording.  The bill
  6 15 also requires the peace officer to record the question and any
  6 16 answer to the question.
  6 17    If a peace officer wearing a body camera interacts with a
  6 18 person reporting a crime, providing information regarding a
  6 19 crime or ongoing investigation, or claiming to be a victim of a
  6 20 crime, the bill requires the peace officer to immediately ask
  6 21 whether the person desires the peace officer to stop the body
  6 22 camera recording of the interaction.  If the person responds in
  6 23 the affirmative, the bill requires the peace officer to stop
  6 24 the body camera recording.  The bill also requires the peace
  6 25 officer to record the question and any answer to the question.
  6 26    The contents of a recording created by a body camera are
  6 27 confidential except as provided for in the bill.
  6 28    The bill requires that an agency shall retain the contents
  6 29 of a recording created by a body camera for 30 days.  However,
  6 30 an agency shall retain the contents of a recording created by
  6 31 a body camera for three years if any of the following apply:
  6 32 the recording depicts an incident involving the use of force;
  6 33 the recording depicts an incident that leads to detention or
  6 34 arrest of a person; the recording is relevant to a formal
  6 35 or informal complaint against a peace officer or agency; or
  7  1 a request has been made to retain the recording.  Under the
  7  2 bill, the contents of the recording may be retained even longer
  7  3 than three years if the contents may be relevant to a criminal
  7  4 prosecution.
  7  5    Any of the following persons may make a request that the
  7  6 contents of a recording created by a body camera be retained
  7  7 for three years: a person who is a part of the content of the
  7  8 recording; a person whose property has been seized or damaged
  7  9 in relation to, or is otherwise involved with, a crime that is
  7 10 related to the recording; a parent or guardian of a person who
  7 11 is part of the content of the recording or whose property was
  7 12 seized, damaged, or involved with a crime that is related to
  7 13 the recording; the attorney for a person who is part of the
  7 14 content of the recording or whose property was seized, damaged,
  7 15 or involved with a crime that is related to the recording; any
  7 16 other person if such person has been given written authority
  7 17 to disclose the contents of the recording by the person who
  7 18 is part of the content of the recording or whose property was
  7 19 seized or damaged.
  7 20    The bill provides that a person, who is not a part of the
  7 21 content of a recording created by a body camera, may request a
  7 22 copy of and receive such recording if each person who is part
  7 23 of the content of the recording consents in writing.
  7 24    Prior to deleting or disposing of the contents of a recording
  7 25 created by a body camera, the bill requires the person who has
  7 26 the responsibility of deleting or disposing of such a recording
  7 27 on behalf of the agency, to review all applicable and available
  7 28 records, files, and databases to ascertain whether any reason
  7 29 exists that the recording should not be disposed of or deleted.
  7 30    A peace officer who fails to record any interaction with
  7 31 a person or who fails to stop recording such interaction
  7 32 as required by the bill commits a violation. For a first
  7 33 violation of the bill a peace officer shall be given a written
  7 34 reprimand.  For a second or subsequent violation of the bill
  7 35 the peace officer shall be suspended until an investigation
  8  1 into the cause of the violation has been completed.
  8  2    The bill also provides that if an agency is unable to produce
  8  3 a body camera recording during a criminal prosecution or civil
  8  4 action, a rebuttable presumption arises that the recording
  8  5 would corroborate the version of the facts advanced by the
  8  6 defendant in the criminal action or the party opposing the
  8  7 peace officer or agency in the civil action.
  8  8    The bill specifies that an agency shall participate in any
  8  9 existing state or federal programs that fund or supplement
  8 10 the costs to purchase and maintain body cameras worn by peace
  8 11 officers.
  8 12    The bill may include a state mandate as defined in Code
  8 13 section 25B.3.  The bill makes inapplicable Code section 25B.2,
  8 14 subsection 3, which would relieve a political subdivision from
  8 15 complying with a state mandate if funding for the cost of
  8 16 the state mandate is not provided or specified.  Therefore,
  8 17 political subdivisions are required to comply with any state
  8 18 mandate included in the bill.

  7 30    A peace officer who fails to record any interaction with
  7 31 a person or who fails to stop recording such interaction
  7 32 as required by the bill commits a violation. For a first
  7 33 violation of the bill a peace officer shall be given a written
  7 34 reprimand.  For a second or subsequent violation of the bill
  7 35 the peace officer shall be suspended until an investigation
  8  1 into the cause of the violation has been completed.

  8  5 would corroborate the version of the facts advanced by the
  8  6 defendant in the criminal action or the party opposing the
  8  7 peace officer or agency in the civil action.
  8  8    The bill specifies that an agency shall participate in any

  5 12                           EXPLANATION
  5 13 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  5 14 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  5 15    This bill requires certain peace officers, including tribal
  5 16 law enforcement officers, to wear a body camera.
  5 17    The bill defines "agency" to mean a law enforcement agency.
  5 18    The bill defines "body camera" to mean an electronic device
  5 19 that is capable of recording video and audio data or capable of
  5 20 transmitting video and audio data to be recorded remotely, and
  5 21 is worn on the person of a peace officer.
  5 22    The body camera requirement applies to a county sheriff
  5 23 or deputy sheriff, city peace officer, peace officer member
  5 24 of the department of public safety, peace officer at a
  5 25 regents institution, conservation officer, an employee of the
  5 26 department of transportation designated as a peace officer,
  5 27 an employee of an aviation authority designated as a peace
  5 28 officer, and a certified tribal law enforcement officer.
  5 29    The bill requires a peace officer to wear a body camera
  5 30 at all times while on duty and in uniform.  The bill further
  5 31 requires that the peace officer record all interactions with
  5 32 people in the performance of the official duties of the peace
  5 33 officer from the beginning to the end of those interactions.
  5 34    The bill specifies that a body camera must be worn on the
  5 35 chest or at the eye level of the peace officer.
  6  1 The bill prohibits a body camera from containing facial
  6  2 recognition technology unless the use of such technology has
  6  3 been authorized by the court pursuant to an arrest or search
  6  4 warrant.
  6  5    The bill requires a peace officer to inform a person when
  6  6 that person is being recorded by a body camera unless informing
  6  7 the person would be unsafe, impractical, or impossible.
  6  8    If a peace officer who is wearing a body camera enters a
  6  9 residence without a warrant or where no exigent circumstances
  6 10 exist, the bill requires that the peace officer immediately ask
  6 11 whether the resident desires the peace officer to stop the body
  6 12 camera recording while the peace officer is in the residence.
  6 13 If the person responds in the affirmative, the bill requires
  6 14 the peace officer to stop the body camera recording.  The bill
  6 15 also requires the peace officer to record the question and any
  6 16 answer to the question.
  6 17    If a peace officer wearing a body camera interacts with a
  6 18 person reporting a crime, providing information regarding a
  6 19 crime or ongoing investigation, or claiming to be a victim of a
  6 20 crime, the bill requires the peace officer to immediately ask
  6 21 whether the person desires the peace officer to stop the body
  6 22 camera recording of the interaction.  If the person responds in
  6 23 the affirmative, the bill requires the peace officer to stop
  6 24 the body camera recording.  The bill also requires the peace
  6 25 officer to record the question and any answer to the question.
  6 26    The contents of a recording created by a body camera are
  6 27 confidential except as provided for in the bill.
  6 28    The bill requires that an agency shall retain the contents
  6 29 of a recording created by a body camera for 30 days.  However,
  6 30 an agency shall retain the contents of a recording created by
  6 31 a body camera for three years if any of the following apply:
  6 32 the recording depicts an incident involving the use of force;
  6 33 the recording depicts an incident that leads to detention or
  6 34 arrest of a person; the recording is relevant to a formal
  6 35 or informal complaint against a peace officer or agency; or
  7  1 a request has been made to retain the recording.  Under the
  7  2 bill, the contents of the recording may be retained even longer
  7  3 than three years if the contents may be relevant to a criminal
  7  4 prosecution.
  7  5    Any of the following persons may make a request that the
  7  6 contents of a recording created by a body camera be retained
  7  7 for three years: a person who is a part of the content of the
  7  8 recording; a person whose property has been seized or damaged
  7  9 in relation to, or is otherwise involved with, a crime that is
  7 10 related to the recording; a parent or guardian of a person who
  7 11 is part of the content of the recording or whose property was
  7 12 seized, damaged, or involved with a crime that is related to
  7 13 the recording; the attorney for a person who is part of the
  7 14 content of the recording or whose property was seized, damaged,
  7 15 or involved with a crime that is related to the recording; any
  7 16 other person if such person has been given written authority
  7 17 to disclose the contents of the recording by the person who
  7 18 is part of the content of the recording or whose property was
  7 19 seized or damaged.
  7 20    The bill provides that a person, who is not a part of the
  7 21 content of a recording created by a body camera, may request a
  7 22 copy of and receive such recording if each person who is part
  7 23 of the content of the recording consents in writing.
  7 24    Prior to deleting or disposing of the contents of a recording
  7 25 created by a body camera, the bill requires the person who has
  7 26 the responsibility of deleting or disposing of such a recording
  7 27 on behalf of the agency, to review all applicable and available
  7 28 records, files, and databases to ascertain whether any reason
  7 29 exists that the recording should not be disposed of or deleted.
  7 30    A peace officer who fails to record any interaction with
  7 31 a person or who fails to stop recording such interaction
  7 32 as required by the bill commits a violation. For a first
  7 33 violation of the bill a peace officer shall be given a written
  7 34 reprimand.  For a second or subsequent violation of the bill
  7 35 the peace officer shall be suspended until an investigation
  8  1 into the cause of the violation has been completed.
  8  2    The bill also provides that if an agency is unable to produce
  8  3 a body camera recording during a criminal prosecution or civil
  8  4 action, a rebuttable presumption arises that the recording
  8  5 would corroborate the version of the facts advanced by the
  8  6 defendant in the criminal action or the party opposing the
  8  7 peace officer or agency in the civil action.
  8  8    The bill specifies that an agency shall participate in any
  8  9 existing state or federal programs that fund or supplement
  8 10 the costs to purchase and maintain body cameras worn by peace
  8 11 officers.
  8 12    The bill may include a state mandate as defined in Code
  8 13 section 25B.3.  The bill makes inapplicable Code section 25B.2,
  8 14 subsection 3, which would relieve a political subdivision from
  8 15 complying with a state mandate if funding for the cost of
  8 16 the state mandate is not provided or specified.  Therefore,
  8 17 political subdivisions are required to comply with any state
  8 18 mandate included in the bill.

  5 12                           EXPLANATION
  5 13 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  5 14 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  5 15    This bill requires certain peace officers, including tribal
  5 16 law enforcement officers, to wear a body camera.
  5 17    The bill defines "agency" to mean a law enforcement agency.
  5 18    The bill defines "body camera" to mean an electronic device
  5 19 that is capable of recording video and audio data or capable of
  5 20 transmitting video and audio data to be recorded remotely, and
  5 21 is worn on the person of a peace officer.
  5 22    The body camera requirement applies to a county sheriff
  5 23 or deputy sheriff, city peace officer, peace officer member
  5 24 of the department of public safety, peace officer at a
  5 25 regents institution, conservation officer, an employee of the
  5 26 department of transportation designated as a peace officer,
  5 27 an employee of an aviation authority designated as a peace
  5 28 officer, and a certified tribal law enforcement officer.
  5 29    The bill requires a peace officer to wear a body camera
  5 30 at all times while on duty and in uniform.  The bill further
  5 31 requires that the peace officer record all interactions with
  5 32 people in the performance of the official duties of the peace
  5 33 officer from the beginning to the end of those interactions.
  5 34    The bill specifies that a body camera must be worn on the
  5 35 chest or at the eye level of the peace officer.
  6  1 The bill prohibits a body camera from containing facial
  6  2 recognition technology unless the use of such technology has
  6  3 been authorized by the court pursuant to an arrest or search
  6  4 warrant.
  6  5    The bill requires a peace officer to inform a person when
  6  6 that person is being recorded by a body camera unless informing
  6  7 the person would be unsafe, impractical, or impossible.
  6  8    If a peace officer who is wearing a body camera enters a
  6  9 residence without a warrant or where no exigent circumstances
  6 10 exist, the bill requires that the peace officer immediately ask
  6 11 whether the resident desires the peace officer to stop the body
  6 12 camera recording while the peace officer is in the residence.
  6 13 If the person responds in the affirmative, the bill requires
  6 14 the peace officer to stop the body camera recording.  The bill
  6 15 also requires the peace officer to record the question and any
  6 16 answer to the question.
  6 17    If a peace officer wearing a body camera interacts with a
  6 18 person reporting a crime, providing information regarding a
  6 19 crime or ongoing investigation, or claiming to be a victim of a
  6 20 crime, the bill requires the peace officer to immediately ask
  6 21 whether the person desires the peace officer to stop the body
  6 22 camera recording of the interaction.  If the person responds in
  6 23 the affirmative, the bill requires the peace officer to stop
  6 24 the body camera recording.  The bill also requires the peace
  6 25 officer to record the question and any answer to the question.
  6 26    The contents of a recording created by a body camera are
  6 27 confidential except as provided for in the bill.
  6 28    The bill requires that an agency shall retain the contents
  6 29 of a recording created by a body camera for 30 days.  However,
  6 30 an agency shall retain the contents of a recording created by
  6 31 a body camera for three years if any of the following apply:
  6 32 the recording depicts an incident involving the use of force;
  6 33 the recording depicts an incident that leads to detention or
  6 34 arrest of a person; the recording is relevant to a formal
  6 35 or informal complaint against a peace officer or agency; or
  7  1 a request has been made to retain the recording.  Under the
  7  2 bill, the contents of the recording may be retained even longer
  7  3 than three years if the contents may be relevant to a criminal
  7  4 prosecution.
  7  5    Any of the following persons may make a request that the
  7  6 contents of a recording created by a body camera be retained
  7  7 for three years: a person who is a part of the content of the
  7  8 recording; a person whose property has been seized or damaged
  7  9 in relation to, or is otherwise involved with, a crime that is
  7 10 related to the recording; a parent or guardian of a person who
  7 11 is part of the content of the recording or whose property was
  7 12 seized, damaged, or involved with a crime that is related to
  7 13 the recording; the attorney for a person who is part of the
  7 14 content of the recording or whose property was seized, damaged,
  7 15 or involved with a crime that is related to the recording; any
  7 16 other person if such person has been given written authority
  7 17 to disclose the contents of the recording by the person who
  7 18 is part of the content of the recording or whose property was
  7 19 seized or damaged.
  7 20    The bill provides that a person, who is not a part of the
  7 21 content of a recording created by a body camera, may request a
  7 22 copy of and receive such recording if each person who is part
  7 23 of the content of the recording consents in writing.
  7 24    Prior to deleting or disposing of the contents of a recording
  7 25 created by a body camera, the bill requires the person who has
  7 26 the responsibility of deleting or disposing of such a recording
  7 27 on behalf of the agency, to review all applicable and available
  7 28 records, files, and databases to ascertain whether any reason
  7 29 exists that the recording should not be disposed of or deleted.
  7 30    A peace officer who fails to record any interaction with
  7 31 a person or who fails to stop recording such interaction
  7 32 as required by the bill commits a violation. For a first
  7 33 violation of the bill a peace officer shall be given a written
  7 34 reprimand.  For a second or subsequent violation of the bill
  7 35 the peace officer shall be suspended until an investigation
  8  1 into the cause of the violation has been completed.
  8  2    The bill also provides that if an agency is unable to produce
  8  3 a body camera recording during a criminal prosecution or civil
  8  4 action, a rebuttable presumption arises that the recording
  8  5 would corroborate the version of the facts advanced by the
  8  6 defendant in the criminal action or the party opposing the
  8  7 peace officer or agency in the civil action.
  8  8    The bill specifies that an agency shall participate in any
  8  9 existing state or federal programs that fund or supplement
  8 10 the costs to purchase and maintain body cameras worn by peace
  8 11 officers.
  8 12    The bill may include a state mandate as defined in Code
  8 13 section 25B.3.  The bill makes inapplicable Code section 25B.2,
  8 14 subsection 3, which would relieve a political subdivision from
  8 15 complying with a state mandate if funding for the cost of
  8 16 the state mandate is not provided or specified.  Therefore,
  8 17 political subdivisions are required to comply with any state
  8 18 mandate included in the bill.

  7 16 other person if such person has been given written authority
  7 17 to disclose the contents of the recording by the person who
  7 18 is part of the content of the recording or whose property was
  7 19 seized or damaged.
  7 20    The bill provides that a person, who is not a part of the
  7 21 content of a recording created by a body camera, may request a
  7 22 copy of and receive such recording if each person who is part
  7 23 of the content of the recording consents in writing.
  7 24    Prior to deleting or disposing of the contents of a recording
  7 25 created by a body camera, the bill requires the person who has
  7 26 the responsibility of deleting or disposing of such a recording
  7 27 on behalf of the agency, to review all applicable and available
  7 28 records, files, and databases to ascertain whether any reason
  7 29 exists that the recording should not be disposed of or deleted.
  7 30    A peace officer who fails to record any interaction with
  7 31 a person or who fails to stop recording such interaction
  7 32 as required by the bill commits a violation. For a first
  7 33 violation of the bill a peace officer shall be given a written
  7 34 reprimand.  For a second or subsequent violation of the bill
  7 35 the peace officer shall be suspended until an investigation
  8  1 into the cause of the violation has been completed.
  8  2    The bill also provides that if an agency is unable to produce
  8  3 a body camera recording during a criminal prosecution or civil
  8  4 action, a rebuttable presumption arises that the recording
  8  5 would corroborate the version of the facts advanced by the
  8  6 defendant in the criminal action or the party opposing the
  8  7 peace officer or agency in the civil action.
  8  8    The bill specifies that an agency shall participate in any
  8  9 existing state or federal programs that fund or supplement
  8 10 the costs to purchase and maintain body cameras worn by peace
  8 11 officers.
  8 12    The bill may include a state mandate as defined in Code
  8 13 section 25B.3.  The bill makes inapplicable Code section 25B.2,
  8 14 subsection 3, which would relieve a political subdivision from
  8 15 complying with a state mandate if funding for the cost of
  8 16 the state mandate is not provided or specified.  Therefore,
  8 17 political subdivisions are required to comply with any state
  8 18 mandate included in the bill.

  5 11 3, shall not apply to this Act.
  5 12                           EXPLANATION
  5 13 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  5 14 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  5 15    This bill requires certain peace officers, including tribal
  5 16 law enforcement officers, to wear a body camera.
  5 17    The bill defines "agency" to mean a law enforcement agency.
  5 18    The bill defines "body camera" to mean an electronic device
  5 19 that is capable of recording video and audio data or capable of
  5 20 transmitting video and audio data to be recorded remotely, and
  5 21 is worn on the person of a peace officer.
  5 22    The body camera requirement applies to a county sheriff
  5 23 or deputy sheriff, city peace officer, peace officer member
  5 24 of the department of public safety, peace officer at a
  5 25 regents institution, conservation officer, an employee of the
  5 26 department of transportation designated as a peace officer,
  5 27 an employee of an aviation authority designated as a peace
  5 28 officer, and a certified tribal law enforcement officer.
  5 29    The bill requires a peace officer to wear a body camera
  5 30 at all times while on duty and in uniform.  The bill further
  5 31 requires that the peace officer record all interactions with
  5 32 people in the performance of the official duties of the peace
  5 33 officer from the beginning to the end of those interactions.
  5 34    The bill specifies that a body camera must be worn on the
  5 35 chest or at the eye level of the peace officer.
  6  1 The bill prohibits a body camera from containing facial
  6  2 recognition technology unless the use of such technology has
  6  3 been authorized by the court pursuant to an arrest or search
  6  4 warrant.
  6  5    The bill requires a peace officer to inform a person when
  6  6 that person is being recorded by a body camera unless informing
  6  7 the person would be unsafe, impractical, or impossible.
  6  8    If a peace officer who is wearing a body camera enters a
  6  9 residence without a warrant or where no exigent circumstances
  6 10 exist, the bill requires that the peace officer immediately ask
  6 11 whether the resident desires the peace officer to stop the body
  6 12 camera recording while the peace officer is in the residence.
  6 13 If the person responds in the affirmative, the bill requires
  6 14 the peace officer to stop the body camera recording.  The bill
  6 15 also requires the peace officer to record the question and any
  6 16 answer to the question.
  6 17    If a peace officer wearing a body camera interacts with a
  6 18 person reporting a crime, providing information regarding a
  6 19 crime or ongoing investigation, or claiming to be a victim of a
  6 20 crime, the bill requires the peace officer to immediately ask
  6 21 whether the person desires the peace officer to stop the body
  6 22 camera recording of the interaction.  If the person responds in
  6 23 the affirmative, the bill requires the peace officer to stop
  6 24 the body camera recording.  The bill also requires the peace
  6 25 officer to record the question and any answer to the question.
  6 26    The contents of a recording created by a body camera are
  6 27 confidential except as provided for in the bill.
  6 28    The bill requires that an agency shall retain the contents
  6 29 of a recording created by a body camera for 30 days.  However,
  6 30 an agency shall retain the contents of a recording created by
  6 31 a body camera for three years if any of the following apply:
  6 32 the recording depicts an incident involving the use of force;
  6 33 the recording depicts an incident that leads to detention or
  6 34 arrest of a person; the recording is relevant to a formal
  6 35 or informal complaint against a peace officer or agency; or
  7  1 a request has been made to retain the recording.  Under the
  7  2 bill, the contents of the recording may be retained even longer
  7  3 than three years if the contents may be relevant to a criminal
  7  4 prosecution.
  7  5    Any of the following persons may make a request that the
  7  6 contents of a recording created by a body camera be retained
  7  7 for three years: a person who is a part of the content of the
  7  8 recording; a person whose property has been seized or damaged
  7  9 in relation to, or is otherwise involved with, a crime that is
  7 10 related to the recording; a parent or guardian of a person who
  7 11 is part of the content of the recording or whose property was
  7 12 seized, damaged, or involved with a crime that is related to
  7 13 the recording; the attorney for a person who is part of the
  7 14 content of the recording or whose property was seized, damaged,
  7 15 or involved with a crime that is related to the recording; any
  7 16 other person if such person has been given written authority
  7 17 to disclose the contents of the recording by the person who
  7 18 is part of the content of the recording or whose property was
  7 19 seized or damaged.
  7 20    The bill provides that a person, who is not a part of the
  7 21 content of a recording created by a body camera, may request a
  7 22 copy of and receive such recording if each person who is part
  7 23 of the content of the recording consents in writing.
  7 24    Prior to deleting or disposing of the contents of a recording
  7 25 created by a body camera, the bill requires the person who has
  7 26 the responsibility of deleting or disposing of such a recording
  7 27 on behalf of the agency, to review all applicable and available
  7 28 records, files, and databases to ascertain whether any reason
  7 29 exists that the recording should not be disposed of or deleted.
  7 30    A peace officer who fails to record any interaction with
  7 31 a person or who fails to stop recording such interaction
  7 32 as required by the bill commits a violation. For a first
  7 33 violation of the bill a peace officer shall be given a written
  7 34 reprimand.  For a second or subsequent violation of the bill
  7 35 the peace officer shall be suspended until an investigation
  8  1 into the cause of the violation has been completed.
  8  2    The bill also provides that if an agency is unable to produce
  8  3 a body camera recording during a criminal prosecution or civil
  8  4 action, a rebuttable presumption arises that the recording
  8  5 would corroborate the version of the facts advanced by the
  8  6 defendant in the criminal action or the party opposing the
  8  7 peace officer or agency in the civil action.
  8  8    The bill specifies that an agency shall participate in any
  8  9 existing state or federal programs that fund or supplement
  8 10 the costs to purchase and maintain body cameras worn by peace
  8 11 officers.
  8 12    The bill may include a state mandate as defined in Code
  8 13 section 25B.3.  The bill makes inapplicable Code section 25B.2,
  8 14 subsection 3, which would relieve a political subdivision from
  8 15 complying with a state mandate if funding for the cost of
  8 16 the state mandate is not provided or specified.  Therefore,
  8 17 political subdivisions are required to comply with any state
  8 18 mandate included in the bill.

  6  8    If a peace officer who is wearing a body camera enters a
  6  9 residence without a warrant or where no exigent circumstances
  6 10 exist, the bill requires that the peace officer immediately ask
  6 11 whether the resident desires the peace officer to stop the body
  6 12 camera recording while the peace officer is in the residence.
  6 13 If the person responds in the affirmative, the bill requires

  6 32 the recording depicts an incident involving the use of force;
  6 33 the recording depicts an incident that leads to detention or
  6 34 arrest of a person; the recording is relevant to a formal
  6 35 or informal complaint against a peace officer or agency; or
  7  1 a request has been made to retain the recording.  Under the
  7  2 bill, the contents of the recording may be retained even longer
  7  3 than three years if the contents may be relevant to a criminal
  7  4 prosecution.
  7  5    Any of the following persons may make a request that the
  7  6 contents of a recording created by a body camera be retained
  7  7 for three years: a person who is a part of the content of the
  7  8 recording; a person whose property has been seized or damaged
  7  9 in relation to, or is otherwise involved with, a crime that is
  7 10 related to the recording; a parent or guardian of a person who

  7 17 to disclose the contents of the recording by the person who
  7 18 is part of the content of the recording or whose property was

  7 20    The bill provides that a person, who is not a part of the
  7 21 content of a recording created by a body camera, may request a
  7 22 copy of and receive such recording if each person who is part
  7 23 of the content of the recording consents in writing.
  7 24    Prior to deleting or disposing of the contents of a recording
  7 25 created by a body camera, the bill requires the person who has
  7 26 the responsibility of deleting or disposing of such a recording
  7 27 on behalf of the agency, to review all applicable and available
  7 28 records, files, and databases to ascertain whether any reason
  7 29 exists that the recording should not be disposed of or deleted.
  7 30    A peace officer who fails to record any interaction with
  7 31 a person or who fails to stop recording such interaction
  7 32 as required by the bill commits a violation. For a first
  7 33 violation of the bill a peace officer shall be given a written
  7 34 reprimand.  For a second or subsequent violation of the bill
  7 35 the peace officer shall be suspended until an investigation
  8  1 into the cause of the violation has been completed.
  8  2    The bill also provides that if an agency is unable to produce
  8  3 a body camera recording during a criminal prosecution or civil
  8  4 action, a rebuttable presumption arises that the recording
  8  5 would corroborate the version of the facts advanced by the
  8  6 defendant in the criminal action or the party opposing the
  8  7 peace officer or agency in the civil action.
  8  8    The bill specifies that an agency shall participate in any
  8  9 existing state or federal programs that fund or supplement
  8 10 the costs to purchase and maintain body cameras worn by peace
  8 11 officers.
  8 12    The bill may include a state mandate as defined in Code
  8 13 section 25B.3.  The bill makes inapplicable Code section 25B.2,
  8 14 subsection 3, which would relieve a political subdivision from
  8 15 complying with a state mandate if funding for the cost of
  8 16 the state mandate is not provided or specified.  Therefore,
  8 17 political subdivisions are required to comply with any state
  8 18 mandate included in the bill.

  5 12                           EXPLANATION
  5 13 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  5 14 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  5 15    This bill requires certain peace officers, including tribal
  5 16 law enforcement officers, to wear a body camera.
  5 17    The bill defines "agency" to mean a law enforcement agency.
  5 18    The bill defines "body camera" to mean an electronic device
  5 19 that is capable of recording video and audio data or capable of
  5 20 transmitting video and audio data to be recorded remotely, and
  5 21 is worn on the person of a peace officer.
  5 22    The body camera requirement applies to a county sheriff
  5 23 or deputy sheriff, city peace officer, peace officer member
  5 24 of the department of public safety, peace officer at a
  5 25 regents institution, conservation officer, an employee of the
  5 26 department of transportation designated as a peace officer,
  5 27 an employee of an aviation authority designated as a peace
  5 28 officer, and a certified tribal law enforcement officer.
  5 29    The bill requires a peace officer to wear a body camera
  5 30 at all times while on duty and in uniform.  The bill further
  5 31 requires that the peace officer record all interactions with
  5 32 people in the performance of the official duties of the peace
  5 33 officer from the beginning to the end of those interactions.
  5 34    The bill specifies that a body camera must be worn on the
  5 35 chest or at the eye level of the peace officer.
  6  1 The bill prohibits a body camera from containing facial
  6  2 recognition technology unless the use of such technology has
  6  3 been authorized by the court pursuant to an arrest or search
  6  4 warrant.
  6  5    The bill requires a peace officer to inform a person when
  6  6 that person is being recorded by a body camera unless informing
  6  7 the person would be unsafe, impractical, or impossible.
  6  8    If a peace officer who is wearing a body camera enters a
  6  9 residence without a warrant or where no exigent circumstances
  6 10 exist, the bill requires that the peace officer immediately ask
  6 11 whether the resident desires the peace officer to stop the body
  6 12 camera recording while the peace officer is in the residence.
  6 13 If the person responds in the affirmative, the bill requires
  6 14 the peace officer to stop the body camera recording.  The bill
  6 15 also requires the peace officer to record the question and any
  6 16 answer to the question.
  6 17    If a peace officer wearing a body camera interacts with a
  6 18 person reporting a crime, providing information regarding a
  6 19 crime or ongoing investigation, or claiming to be a victim of a
  6 20 crime, the bill requires the peace officer to immediately ask
  6 21 whether the person desires the peace officer to stop the body
  6 22 camera recording of the interaction.  If the person responds in
  6 23 the affirmative, the bill requires the peace officer to stop
  6 24 the body camera recording.  The bill also requires the peace
  6 25 officer to record the question and any answer to the question.
  6 26    The contents of a recording created by a body camera are
  6 27 confidential except as provided for in the bill.
  6 28    The bill requires that an agency shall retain the contents
  6 29 of a recording created by a body camera for 30 days.  However,
  6 30 an agency shall retain the contents of a recording created by
  6 31 a body camera for three years if any of the following apply:
  6 32 the recording depicts an incident involving the use of force;
  6 33 the recording depicts an incident that leads to detention or
  6 34 arrest of a person; the recording is relevant to a formal
  6 35 or informal complaint against a peace officer or agency; or
  7  1 a request has been made to retain the recording.  Under the
  7  2 bill, the contents of the recording may be retained even longer
  7  3 than three years if the contents may be relevant to a criminal
  7  4 prosecution.
  7  5    Any of the following persons may make a request that the
  7  6 contents of a recording created by a body camera be retained
  7  7 for three years: a person who is a part of the content of the
  7  8 recording; a person whose property has been seized or damaged
  7  9 in relation to, or is otherwise involved with, a crime that is
  7 10 related to the recording; a parent or guardian of a person who
  7 11 is part of the content of the recording or whose property was
  7 12 seized, damaged, or involved with a crime that is related to
  7 13 the recording; the attorney for a person who is part of the
  7 14 content of the recording or whose property was seized, damaged,
  7 15 or involved with a crime that is related to the recording; any
  7 16 other person if such person has been given written authority
  7 17 to disclose the contents of the recording by the person who
  7 18 is part of the content of the recording or whose property was
  7 19 seized or damaged.
  7 20    The bill provides that a person, who is not a part of the
  7 21 content of a recording created by a body camera, may request a
  7 22 copy of and receive such recording if each person who is part
  7 23 of the content of the recording consents in writing.
  7 24    Prior to deleting or disposing of the contents of a recording
  7 25 created by a body camera, the bill requires the person who has
  7 26 the responsibility of deleting or disposing of such a recording
  7 27 on behalf of the agency, to review all applicable and available
  7 28 records, files, and databases to ascertain whether any reason
  7 29 exists that the recording should not be disposed of or deleted.
  7 30    A peace officer who fails to record any interaction with
  7 31 a person or who fails to stop recording such interaction
  7 32 as required by the bill commits a violation. For a first
  7 33 violation of the bill a peace officer shall be given a written
  7 34 reprimand.  For a second or subsequent violation of the bill
  7 35 the peace officer shall be suspended until an investigation
  8  1 into the cause of the violation has been completed.
  8  2    The bill also provides that if an agency is unable to produce
  8  3 a body camera recording during a criminal prosecution or civil
  8  4 action, a rebuttable presumption arises that the recording
  8  5 would corroborate the version of the facts advanced by the
  8  6 defendant in the criminal action or the party opposing the
  8  7 peace officer or agency in the civil action.
  8  8    The bill specifies that an agency shall participate in any
  8  9 existing state or federal programs that fund or supplement
  8 10 the costs to purchase and maintain body cameras worn by peace
  8 11 officers.
  8 12    The bill may include a state mandate as defined in Code
  8 13 section 25B.3.  The bill makes inapplicable Code section 25B.2,
  8 14 subsection 3, which would relieve a political subdivision from
  8 15 complying with a state mandate if funding for the cost of
  8 16 the state mandate is not provided or specified.  Therefore,
  8 17 political subdivisions are required to comply with any state
  8 18 mandate included in the bill.

  7  9 in relation to, or is otherwise involved with, a crime that is
  7 10 related to the recording; a parent or guardian of a person who

  7 17 to disclose the contents of the recording by the person who
  7 18 is part of the content of the recording or whose property was

  7 20    The bill provides that a person, who is not a part of the
  7 21 content of a recording created by a body camera, may request a
  7 22 copy of and receive such recording if each person who is part

  7 27 on behalf of the agency, to review all applicable and available
  7 28 records, files, and databases to ascertain whether any reason
  7 29 exists that the recording should not be disposed of or deleted.
  7 30    A peace officer who fails to record any interaction with
  7 31 a person or who fails to stop recording such interaction
  7 32 as required by the bill commits a violation. For a first

  5 13 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  5 14 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  5 15    This bill requires certain peace officers, including tribal
  5 16 law enforcement officers, to wear a body camera.
  5 17    The bill defines "agency" to mean a law enforcement agency.
  5 18    The bill defines "body camera" to mean an electronic device
  5 19 that is capable of recording video and audio data or capable of
  5 20 transmitting video and audio data to be recorded remotely, and
  5 21 is worn on the person of a peace officer.
  5 22    The body camera requirement applies to a county sheriff
  5 23 or deputy sheriff, city peace officer, peace officer member
  5 24 of the department of public safety, peace officer at a
  5 25 regents institution, conservation officer, an employee of the
  5 26 department of transportation designated as a peace officer,
  5 27 an employee of an aviation authority designated as a peace
  5 28 officer, and a certified tribal law enforcement officer.
  5 29    The bill requires a peace officer to wear a body camera
  5 30 at all times while on duty and in uniform.  The bill further
  5 31 requires that the peace officer record all interactions with
  5 32 people in the performance of the official duties of the peace
  5 33 officer from the beginning to the end of those interactions.
  5 34    The bill specifies that a body camera must be worn on the
  5 35 chest or at the eye level of the peace officer.
  6  1 The bill prohibits a body camera from containing facial
  6  2 recognition technology unless the use of such technology has
  6  3 been authorized by the court pursuant to an arrest or search
  6  4 warrant.
  6  5    The bill requires a peace officer to inform a person when
  6  6 that person is being recorded by a body camera unless informing
  6  7 the person would be unsafe, impractical, or impossible.
  6  8    If a peace officer who is wearing a body camera enters a
  6  9 residence without a warrant or where no exigent circumstances
  6 10 exist, the bill requires that the peace officer immediately ask
  6 11 whether the resident desires the peace officer to stop the body
  6 12 camera recording while the peace officer is in the residence.
  6 13 If the person responds in the affirmative, the bill requires
  6 14 the peace officer to stop the body camera recording.  The bill
  6 15 also requires the peace officer to record the question and any
  6 16 answer to the question.
  6 17    If a peace officer wearing a body camera interacts with a
  6 18 person reporting a crime, providing information regarding a
  6 19 crime or ongoing investigation, or claiming to be a victim of a
  6 20 crime, the bill requires the peace officer to immediately ask
  6 21 whether the person desires the peace officer to stop the body
  6 22 camera recording of the interaction.  If the person responds in
  6 23 the affirmative, the bill requires the peace officer to stop
  6 24 the body camera recording.  The bill also requires the peace
  6 25 officer to record the question and any answer to the question.
  6 26    The contents of a recording created by a body camera are
  6 27 confidential except as provided for in the bill.
  6 28    The bill requires that an agency shall retain the contents
  6 29 of a recording created by a body camera for 30 days.  However,
  6 30 an agency shall retain the contents of a recording created by
  6 31 a body camera for three years if any of the following apply:
  6 32 the recording depicts an incident involving the use of force;
  6 33 the recording depicts an incident that leads to detention or
  6 34 arrest of a person; the recording is relevant to a formal
  6 35 or informal complaint against a peace officer or agency; or
  7  1 a request has been made to retain the recording.  Under the
  7  2 bill, the contents of the recording may be retained even longer
  7  3 than three years if the contents may be relevant to a criminal
  7  4 prosecution.
  7  5    Any of the following persons may make a request that the

  6  5    The bill requires a peace officer to inform a person when
  6  6 that person is being recorded by a body camera unless informing
  6  7 the person would be unsafe, impractical, or impossible.
  6  8    If a peace officer who is wearing a body camera enters a
  6  9 residence without a warrant or where no exigent circumstances
  6 10 exist, the bill requires that the peace officer immediately ask
  6 11 whether the resident desires the peace officer to stop the body
  6 12 camera recording while the peace officer is in the residence.
  6 13 If the person responds in the affirmative, the bill requires

  6 32 the recording depicts an incident involving the use of force;
  6 33 the recording depicts an incident that leads to detention or
  6 34 arrest of a person; the recording is relevant to a formal
  6 35 or informal complaint against a peace officer or agency; or
  7  1 a request has been made to retain the recording.  Under the
  7  2 bill, the contents of the recording may be retained even longer
  7  3 than three years if the contents may be relevant to a criminal
  7  4 prosecution.
  7  5    Any of the following persons may make a request that the
  7  6 contents of a recording created by a body camera be retained
  7  7 for three years: a person who is a part of the content of the
  7  8 recording; a person whose property has been seized or damaged

  7 17 to disclose the contents of the recording by the person who
  7 18 is part of the content of the recording or whose property was
  7 19 seized or damaged.
  7 20    The bill provides that a person, who is not a part of the
  7 21 content of a recording created by a body camera, may request a
  7 22 copy of and receive such recording if each person who is part
  7 23 of the content of the recording consents in writing.
  7 24    Prior to deleting or disposing of the contents of a recording
  7 25 created by a body camera, the bill requires the person who has
  7 26 the responsibility of deleting or disposing of such a recording
  7 27 on behalf of the agency, to review all applicable and available
  7 28 records, files, and databases to ascertain whether any reason
  7 29 exists that the recording should not be disposed of or deleted.
  7 30    A peace officer who fails to record any interaction with
  7 31 a person or who fails to stop recording such interaction
  7 32 as required by the bill commits a violation. For a first
  7 33 violation of the bill a peace officer shall be given a written
  7 34 reprimand.  For a second or subsequent violation of the bill
  7 35 the peace officer shall be suspended until an investigation
  8  1 into the cause of the violation has been completed.
  8  2    The bill also provides that if an agency is unable to produce
  8  3 a body camera recording during a criminal prosecution or civil
  8  4 action, a rebuttable presumption arises that the recording
  8  5 would corroborate the version of the facts advanced by the
  8  6 defendant in the criminal action or the party opposing the
  8  7 peace officer or agency in the civil action.
  8  8    The bill specifies that an agency shall participate in any
  8  9 existing state or federal programs that fund or supplement
  8 10 the costs to purchase and maintain body cameras worn by peace
  8 11 officers.
  8 12    The bill may include a state mandate as defined in Code
  8 13 section 25B.3.  The bill makes inapplicable Code section 25B.2,
  8 14 subsection 3, which would relieve a political subdivision from
  8 15 complying with a state mandate if funding for the cost of
  8 16 the state mandate is not provided or specified.  Therefore,
  8 17 political subdivisions are required to comply with any state

  5 12                           EXPLANATION
  5 13 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  5 14 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  5 15    This bill requires certain peace officers, including tribal
  5 16 law enforcement officers, to wear a body camera.
  5 17    The bill defines "agency" to mean a law enforcement agency.
  5 18    The bill defines "body camera" to mean an electronic device
  5 19 that is capable of recording video and audio data or capable of
  5 20 transmitting video and audio data to be recorded remotely, and
  5 21 is worn on the person of a peace officer.
  5 22    The body camera requirement applies to a county sheriff
  5 23 or deputy sheriff, city peace officer, peace officer member
  5 24 of the department of public safety, peace officer at a
  5 25 regents institution, conservation officer, an employee of the
  5 26 department of transportation designated as a peace officer,
  5 27 an employee of an aviation authority designated as a peace
  5 28 officer, and a certified tribal law enforcement officer.
  5 29    The bill requires a peace officer to wear a body camera
  5 30 at all times while on duty and in uniform.  The bill further
  5 31 requires that the peace officer record all interactions with
  5 32 people in the performance of the official duties of the peace
  5 33 officer from the beginning to the end of those interactions.
  5 34    The bill specifies that a body camera must be worn on the
  5 35 chest or at the eye level of the peace officer.
  6  1 The bill prohibits a body camera from containing facial
  6  2 recognition technology unless the use of such technology has
  6  3 been authorized by the court pursuant to an arrest or search
  6  4 warrant.
  6  5    The bill requires a peace officer to inform a person when
  6  6 that person is being recorded by a body camera unless informing
  6  7 the person would be unsafe, impractical, or impossible.
  6  8    If a peace officer who is wearing a body camera enters a
  6  9 residence without a warrant or where no exigent circumstances
  6 10 exist, the bill requires that the peace officer immediately ask
  6 11 whether the resident desires the peace officer to stop the body
  6 12 camera recording while the peace officer is in the residence.
  6 13 If the person responds in the affirmative, the bill requires
  6 14 the peace officer to stop the body camera recording.  The bill
  6 15 also requires the peace officer to record the question and any
  6 16 answer to the question.
  6 17    If a peace officer wearing a body camera interacts with a
  6 18 person reporting a crime, providing information regarding a
  6 19 crime or ongoing investigation, or claiming to be a victim of a
  6 20 crime, the bill requires the peace officer to immediately ask
  6 21 whether the person desires the peace officer to stop the body
  6 22 camera recording of the interaction.  If the person responds in
  6 23 the affirmative, the bill requires the peace officer to stop
  6 24 the body camera recording.  The bill also requires the peace
  6 25 officer to record the question and any answer to the question.
  6 26    The contents of a recording created by a body camera are
  6 27 confidential except as provided for in the bill.
  6 28    The bill requires that an agency shall retain the contents
  6 29 of a recording created by a body camera for 30 days.  However,
  6 30 an agency shall retain the contents of a recording created by
  6 31 a body camera for three years if any of the following apply:
  6 32 the recording depicts an incident involving the use of force;
  6 33 the recording depicts an incident that leads to detention or
  6 34 arrest of a person; the recording is relevant to a formal
  6 35 or informal complaint against a peace officer or agency; or
  7  1 a request has been made to retain the recording.  Under the
  7  2 bill, the contents of the recording may be retained even longer
  7  3 than three years if the contents may be relevant to a criminal
  7  4 prosecution.
  7  5    Any of the following persons may make a request that the
  7  6 contents of a recording created by a body camera be retained
  7  7 for three years: a person who is a part of the content of the
  7  8 recording; a person whose property has been seized or damaged
  7  9 in relation to, or is otherwise involved with, a crime that is
  7 10 related to the recording; a parent or guardian of a person who
  7 11 is part of the content of the recording or whose property was
  7 12 seized, damaged, or involved with a crime that is related to
  7 13 the recording; the attorney for a person who is part of the
  7 14 content of the recording or whose property was seized, damaged,
  7 15 or involved with a crime that is related to the recording; any
  7 16 other person if such person has been given written authority
  7 17 to disclose the contents of the recording by the person who
  7 18 is part of the content of the recording or whose property was
  7 19 seized or damaged.
  7 20    The bill provides that a person, who is not a part of the
  7 21 content of a recording created by a body camera, may request a
  7 22 copy of and receive such recording if each person who is part
  7 23 of the content of the recording consents in writing.
  7 24    Prior to deleting or disposing of the contents of a recording
  7 25 created by a body camera, the bill requires the person who has
  7 26 the responsibility of deleting or disposing of such a recording
  7 27 on behalf of the agency, to review all applicable and available
  7 28 records, files, and databases to ascertain whether any reason
  7 29 exists that the recording should not be disposed of or deleted.
  7 30    A peace officer who fails to record any interaction with
  7 31 a person or who fails to stop recording such interaction
  7 32 as required by the bill commits a violation. For a first
  7 33 violation of the bill a peace officer shall be given a written
  7 34 reprimand.  For a second or subsequent violation of the bill
  7 35 the peace officer shall be suspended until an investigation
  8  1 into the cause of the violation has been completed.
  8  2    The bill also provides that if an agency is unable to produce
  8  3 a body camera recording during a criminal prosecution or civil
  8  4 action, a rebuttable presumption arises that the recording
  8  5 would corroborate the version of the facts advanced by the
  8  6 defendant in the criminal action or the party opposing the
  8  7 peace officer or agency in the civil action.
  8  8    The bill specifies that an agency shall participate in any
  8  9 existing state or federal programs that fund or supplement
  8 10 the costs to purchase and maintain body cameras worn by peace
  8 11 officers.
  8 12    The bill may include a state mandate as defined in Code
  8 13 section 25B.3.  The bill makes inapplicable Code section 25B.2,
  8 14 subsection 3, which would relieve a political subdivision from
  8 15 complying with a state mandate if funding for the cost of
  8 16 the state mandate is not provided or specified.  Therefore,
  8 17 political subdivisions are required to comply with any state
  8 18 mandate included in the bill.

  4 15 consents in writing.  If consent is obtained, the agency shall
  4 16 provide the requesting person with a copy of the contents of
  4 17 such a recording.
  4 18    g.  Prior to deleting or disposing of the contents of a
  4 19 recording created by a body camera, the person who has the
  4 20 responsibility of deleting or disposing of such a recording on
  4 21 behalf of the agency, shall review all applicable and available
  4 22 records, files, and databases to ascertain whether any reason
  4 23 exists that the recording should not be deleted or disposed of
  4 24 under this section or under the policies of the agency. The
  4 25 contents of such a recording shall not be deleted or disposed
  4 26 of if such a reason exists.
  4 27    7.  A peace officer who fails to record any interaction as
  4 28 required by this section or who fails to stop recording an
  4 29 interaction as required by this section shall be considered
  4 30 to have committed a violation of this section. For a first
  4 31 violation a peace officer shall be given a written reprimand.
  4 32 For a second or subsequent violation the peace officer shall
  4 33 be suspended until an investigation into the cause of the
  4 34 violation has been completed.
  4 35    8.  If an agency is unable to produce a body camera recording
  5  1 during a criminal prosecution or civil action which is required
  5  2 to be made and retained pursuant to this section, a rebuttable
  5  3 presumption arises that the recording would corroborate the
  5  4 version of the facts advanced by the defendant in the criminal
  5  5 action or the party opposing the peace officer or agency in the
  5  6 civil action.
  5  7    9.  The agency shall participate in any existing state or

  5 12                           EXPLANATION
  5 13 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  5 14 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  5 15    This bill requires certain peace officers, including tribal
  5 16 law enforcement officers, to wear a body camera.
  5 17    The bill defines "agency" to mean a law enforcement agency.
  5 18    The bill defines "body camera" to mean an electronic device
  5 19 that is capable of recording video and audio data or capable of
  5 20 transmitting video and audio data to be recorded remotely, and
  5 21 is worn on the person of a peace officer.
  5 22    The body camera requirement applies to a county sheriff
  5 23 or deputy sheriff, city peace officer, peace officer member
  5 24 of the department of public safety, peace officer at a
  5 25 regents institution, conservation officer, an employee of the
  5 26 department of transportation designated as a peace officer,
  5 27 an employee of an aviation authority designated as a peace
  5 28 officer, and a certified tribal law enforcement officer.
  5 29    The bill requires a peace officer to wear a body camera
  5 30 at all times while on duty and in uniform.  The bill further
  5 31 requires that the peace officer record all interactions with
  5 32 people in the performance of the official duties of the peace
  5 33 officer from the beginning to the end of those interactions.
  5 34    The bill specifies that a body camera must be worn on the
  5 35 chest or at the eye level of the peace officer.
  6  1 The bill prohibits a body camera from containing facial
  6  2 recognition technology unless the use of such technology has
  6  3 been authorized by the court pursuant to an arrest or search
  6  4 warrant.
  6  5    The bill requires a peace officer to inform a person when
  6  6 that person is being recorded by a body camera unless informing
  6  7 the person would be unsafe, impractical, or impossible.
  6  8    If a peace officer who is wearing a body camera enters a
  6  9 residence without a warrant or where no exigent circumstances
  6 10 exist, the bill requires that the peace officer immediately ask
  6 11 whether the resident desires the peace officer to stop the body
  6 12 camera recording while the peace officer is in the residence.
  6 13 If the person responds in the affirmative, the bill requires
  6 14 the peace officer to stop the body camera recording.  The bill
  6 15 also requires the peace officer to record the question and any
  6 16 answer to the question.
  6 17    If a peace officer wearing a body camera interacts with a
  6 18 person reporting a crime, providing information regarding a
  6 19 crime or ongoing investigation, or claiming to be a victim of a
  6 20 crime, the bill requires the peace officer to immediately ask
  6 21 whether the person desires the peace officer to stop the body
  6 22 camera recording of the interaction.  If the person responds in
  6 23 the affirmative, the bill requires the peace officer to stop
  6 24 the body camera recording.  The bill also requires the peace
  6 25 officer to record the question and any answer to the question.
  6 26    The contents of a recording created by a body camera are
  6 27 confidential except as provided for in the bill.
  6 28    The bill requires that an agency shall retain the contents
  6 29 of a recording created by a body camera for 30 days.  However,
  6 30 an agency shall retain the contents of a recording created by
  6 31 a body camera for three years if any of the following apply:
  6 32 the recording depicts an incident involving the use of force;
  6 33 the recording depicts an incident that leads to detention or
  6 34 arrest of a person; the recording is relevant to a formal
  6 35 or informal complaint against a peace officer or agency; or
  7  1 a request has been made to retain the recording.  Under the
  7  2 bill, the contents of the recording may be retained even longer
  7  3 than three years if the contents may be relevant to a criminal
  7  4 prosecution.
  7  5    Any of the following persons may make a request that the
  7  6 contents of a recording created by a body camera be retained
  7  7 for three years: a person who is a part of the content of the
  7  8 recording; a person whose property has been seized or damaged
  7  9 in relation to, or is otherwise involved with, a crime that is
  7 10 related to the recording; a parent or guardian of a person who
  7 11 is part of the content of the recording or whose property was
  7 12 seized, damaged, or involved with a crime that is related to
  7 13 the recording; the attorney for a person who is part of the
  7 14 content of the recording or whose property was seized, damaged,
  7 15 or involved with a crime that is related to the recording; any
  7 16 other person if such person has been given written authority
  7 17 to disclose the contents of the recording by the person who
  7 18 is part of the content of the recording or whose property was
  7 19 seized or damaged.
  7 20    The bill provides that a person, who is not a part of the
  7 21 content of a recording created by a body camera, may request a
  7 22 copy of and receive such recording if each person who is part
  7 23 of the content of the recording consents in writing.
  7 24    Prior to deleting or disposing of the contents of a recording
  7 25 created by a body camera, the bill requires the person who has
  7 26 the responsibility of deleting or disposing of such a recording
  7 27 on behalf of the agency, to review all applicable and available
  7 28 records, files, and databases to ascertain whether any reason
  7 29 exists that the recording should not be disposed of or deleted.
  7 30    A peace officer who fails to record any interaction with
  7 31 a person or who fails to stop recording such interaction
  7 32 as required by the bill commits a violation. For a first
  7 33 violation of the bill a peace officer shall be given a written
  7 34 reprimand.  For a second or subsequent violation of the bill
  7 35 the peace officer shall be suspended until an investigation
  8  1 into the cause of the violation has been completed.
  8  2    The bill also provides that if an agency is unable to produce
  8  3 a body camera recording during a criminal prosecution or civil
  8  4 action, a rebuttable presumption arises that the recording
  8  5 would corroborate the version of the facts advanced by the
  8  6 defendant in the criminal action or the party opposing the
  8  7 peace officer or agency in the civil action.
  8  8    The bill specifies that an agency shall participate in any
  8  9 existing state or federal programs that fund or supplement
  8 10 the costs to purchase and maintain body cameras worn by peace
  8 11 officers.
  8 12    The bill may include a state mandate as defined in Code
  8 13 section 25B.3.  The bill makes inapplicable Code section 25B.2,
  8 14 subsection 3, which would relieve a political subdivision from
  8 15 complying with a state mandate if funding for the cost of
  8 16 the state mandate is not provided or specified.  Therefore,
  8 17 political subdivisions are required to comply with any state
  8 18 mandate included in the bill.

  5 12                           EXPLANATION
  5 13 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  5 14 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  5 15    This bill requires certain peace officers, including tribal
  5 16 law enforcement officers, to wear a body camera.
  5 17    The bill defines "agency" to mean a law enforcement agency.
  5 18    The bill defines "body camera" to mean an electronic device
  5 19 that is capable of recording video and audio data or capable of
  5 20 transmitting video and audio data to be recorded remotely, and
  5 21 is worn on the person of a peace officer.
  5 22    The body camera requirement applies to a county sheriff
  5 23 or deputy sheriff, city peace officer, peace officer member
  5 24 of the department of public safety, peace officer at a
  5 25 regents institution, conservation officer, an employee of the
  5 26 department of transportation designated as a peace officer,
  5 27 an employee of an aviation authority designated as a peace
  5 28 officer, and a certified tribal law enforcement officer.
  5 29    The bill requires a peace officer to wear a body camera
  5 30 at all times while on duty and in uniform.  The bill further
  5 31 requires that the peace officer record all interactions with
  5 32 people in the performance of the official duties of the peace
  5 33 officer from the beginning to the end of those interactions.
  5 34    The bill specifies that a body camera must be worn on the
  5 35 chest or at the eye level of the peace officer.
  6  1 The bill prohibits a body camera from containing facial
  6  2 recognition technology unless the use of such technology has
  6  3 been authorized by the court pursuant to an arrest or search
  6  4 warrant.
  6  5    The bill requires a peace officer to inform a person when
  6  6 that person is being recorded by a body camera unless informing
  6  7 the person would be unsafe, impractical, or impossible.
  6  8    If a peace officer who is wearing a body camera enters a
  6  9 residence without a warrant or where no exigent circumstances
  6 10 exist, the bill requires that the peace officer immediately ask
  6 11 whether the resident desires the peace officer to stop the body
  6 12 camera recording while the peace officer is in the residence.
  6 13 If the person responds in the affirmative, the bill requires
  6 14 the peace officer to stop the body camera recording.  The bill
  6 15 also requires the peace officer to record the question and any
  6 16 answer to the question.
  6 17    If a peace officer wearing a body camera interacts with a
  6 18 person reporting a crime, providing information regarding a
  6 19 crime or ongoing investigation, or claiming to be a victim of a
  6 20 crime, the bill requires the peace officer to immediately ask
  6 21 whether the person desires the peace officer to stop the body
  6 22 camera recording of the interaction.  If the person responds in
  6 23 the affirmative, the bill requires the peace officer to stop
  6 24 the body camera recording.  The bill also requires the peace
  6 25 officer to record the question and any answer to the question.
  6 26    The contents of a recording created by a body camera are
  6 27 confidential except as provided for in the bill.
  6 28    The bill requires that an agency shall retain the contents
  6 29 of a recording created by a body camera for 30 days.  However,
  6 30 an agency shall retain the contents of a recording created by
  6 31 a body camera for three years if any of the following apply:
  6 32 the recording depicts an incident involving the use of force;
  6 33 the recording depicts an incident that leads to detention or
  6 34 arrest of a person; the recording is relevant to a formal
  6 35 or informal complaint against a peace officer or agency; or
  7  1 a request has been made to retain the recording.  Under the
  7  2 bill, the contents of the recording may be retained even longer
  7  3 than three years if the contents may be relevant to a criminal
  7  4 prosecution.
  7  5    Any of the following persons may make a request that the
  7  6 contents of a recording created by a body camera be retained
  7  7 for three years: a person who is a part of the content of the
  7  8 recording; a person whose property has been seized or damaged
  7  9 in relation to, or is otherwise involved with, a crime that is
  7 10 related to the recording; a parent or guardian of a person who
  7 11 is part of the content of the recording or whose property was
  7 12 seized, damaged, or involved with a crime that is related to
  7 13 the recording; the attorney for a person who is part of the
  7 14 content of the recording or whose property was seized, damaged,
  7 15 or involved with a crime that is related to the recording; any
  7 16 other person if such person has been given written authority
  7 17 to disclose the contents of the recording by the person who
  7 18 is part of the content of the recording or whose property was
  7 19 seized or damaged.
  7 20    The bill provides that a person, who is not a part of the
  7 21 content of a recording created by a body camera, may request a
  7 22 copy of and receive such recording if each person who is part
  7 23 of the content of the recording consents in writing.
  7 24    Prior to deleting or disposing of the contents of a recording
  7 25 created by a body camera, the bill requires the person who has
  7 26 the responsibility of deleting or disposing of such a recording
  7 27 on behalf of the agency, to review all applicable and available
  7 28 records, files, and databases to ascertain whether any reason
  7 29 exists that the recording should not be disposed of or deleted.
  7 30    A peace officer who fails to record any interaction with
  7 31 a person or who fails to stop recording such interaction
  7 32 as required by the bill commits a violation. For a first
  7 33 violation of the bill a peace officer shall be given a written
  7 34 reprimand.  For a second or subsequent violation of the bill
  7 35 the peace officer shall be suspended until an investigation
  8  1 into the cause of the violation has been completed.
  8  2    The bill also provides that if an agency is unable to produce
  8  3 a body camera recording during a criminal prosecution or civil
  8  4 action, a rebuttable presumption arises that the recording
  8  5 would corroborate the version of the facts advanced by the
  8  6 defendant in the criminal action or the party opposing the
  8  7 peace officer or agency in the civil action.
  8  8    The bill specifies that an agency shall participate in any
  8  9 existing state or federal programs that fund or supplement
  8 10 the costs to purchase and maintain body cameras worn by peace
  8 11 officers.
  8 12    The bill may include a state mandate as defined in Code
  8 13 section 25B.3.  The bill makes inapplicable Code section 25B.2,
  8 14 subsection 3, which would relieve a political subdivision from
  8 15 complying with a state mandate if funding for the cost of
  8 16 the state mandate is not provided or specified.  Therefore,

  5 12                           EXPLANATION
  5 13 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  5 14 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  5 15    This bill requires certain peace officers, including tribal
  5 16 law enforcement officers, to wear a body camera.
  5 17    The bill defines "agency" to mean a law enforcement agency.
  5 18    The bill defines "body camera" to mean an electronic device
  5 19 that is capable of recording video and audio data or capable of
  5 20 transmitting video and audio data to be recorded remotely, and
  5 21 is worn on the person of a peace officer.
  5 22    The body camera requirement applies to a county sheriff
  5 23 or deputy sheriff, city peace officer, peace officer member
  5 24 of the department of public safety, peace officer at a
  5 25 regents institution, conservation officer, an employee of the
  5 26 department of transportation designated as a peace officer,
  5 27 an employee of an aviation authority designated as a peace
  5 28 officer, and a certified tribal law enforcement officer.
  5 29    The bill requires a peace officer to wear a body camera
  5 30 at all times while on duty and in uniform.  The bill further
  5 31 requires that the peace officer record all interactions with
  5 32 people in the performance of the official duties of the peace
  5 33 officer from the beginning to the end of those interactions.
  5 34    The bill specifies that a body camera must be worn on the
  5 35 chest or at the eye level of the peace officer.
  6  1 The bill prohibits a body camera from containing facial
  6  2 recognition technology unless the use of such technology has
  6  3 been authorized by the court pursuant to an arrest or search
  6  4 warrant.
  6  5    The bill requires a peace officer to inform a person when
  6  6 that person is being recorded by a body camera unless informing
  6  7 the person would be unsafe, impractical, or impossible.
  6  8    If a peace officer who is wearing a body camera enters a
  6  9 residence without a warrant or where no exigent circumstances
  6 10 exist, the bill requires that the peace officer immediately ask
  6 11 whether the resident desires the peace officer to stop the body
  6 12 camera recording while the peace officer is in the residence.
  6 13 If the person responds in the affirmative, the bill requires
  6 14 the peace officer to stop the body camera recording.  The bill
  6 15 also requires the peace officer to record the question and any
  6 16 answer to the question.
  6 17    If a peace officer wearing a body camera interacts with a
  6 18 person reporting a crime, providing information regarding a
  6 19 crime or ongoing investigation, or claiming to be a victim of a
  6 20 crime, the bill requires the peace officer to immediately ask
  6 21 whether the person desires the peace officer to stop the body
  6 22 camera recording of the interaction.  If the person responds in
  6 23 the affirmative, the bill requires the peace officer to stop
  6 24 the body camera recording.  The bill also requires the peace
  6 25 officer to record the question and any answer to the question.
  6 26    The contents of a recording created by a body camera are
  6 27 confidential except as provided for in the bill.
  6 28    The bill requires that an agency shall retain the contents
  6 29 of a recording created by a body camera for 30 days.  However,
  6 30 an agency shall retain the contents of a recording created by
  6 31 a body camera for three years if any of the following apply:
  6 32 the recording depicts an incident involving the use of force;
  6 33 the recording depicts an incident that leads to detention or
  6 34 arrest of a person; the recording is relevant to a formal
  6 35 or informal complaint against a peace officer or agency; or
  7  1 a request has been made to retain the recording.  Under the
  7  2 bill, the contents of the recording may be retained even longer
  7  3 than three years if the contents may be relevant to a criminal
  7  4 prosecution.
  7  5    Any of the following persons may make a request that the
  7  6 contents of a recording created by a body camera be retained
  7  7 for three years: a person who is a part of the content of the
  7  8 recording; a person whose property has been seized or damaged
  7  9 in relation to, or is otherwise involved with, a crime that is
  7 10 related to the recording; a parent or guardian of a person who
  7 11 is part of the content of the recording or whose property was
  7 12 seized, damaged, or involved with a crime that is related to
  7 13 the recording; the attorney for a person who is part of the
  7 14 content of the recording or whose property was seized, damaged,
  7 15 or involved with a crime that is related to the recording; any
  7 16 other person if such person has been given written authority
  7 17 to disclose the contents of the recording by the person who
  7 18 is part of the content of the recording or whose property was
  7 19 seized or damaged.
  7 20    The bill provides that a person, who is not a part of the
  7 21 content of a recording created by a body camera, may request a
  7 22 copy of and receive such recording if each person who is part
  7 23 of the content of the recording consents in writing.
  7 24    Prior to deleting or disposing of the contents of a recording
  7 25 created by a body camera, the bill requires the person who has
  7 26 the responsibility of deleting or disposing of such a recording
  7 27 on behalf of the agency, to review all applicable and available
  7 28 records, files, and databases to ascertain whether any reason
  7 29 exists that the recording should not be disposed of or deleted.
  7 30    A peace officer who fails to record any interaction with
  7 31 a person or who fails to stop recording such interaction
  7 32 as required by the bill commits a violation. For a first
  7 33 violation of the bill a peace officer shall be given a written
  7 34 reprimand.  For a second or subsequent violation of the bill
  7 35 the peace officer shall be suspended until an investigation
  8  1 into the cause of the violation has been completed.
  8  2    The bill also provides that if an agency is unable to produce
  8  3 a body camera recording during a criminal prosecution or civil
  8  4 action, a rebuttable presumption arises that the recording
  8  5 would corroborate the version of the facts advanced by the
  8  6 defendant in the criminal action or the party opposing the
  8  7 peace officer or agency in the civil action.
  8  8    The bill specifies that an agency shall participate in any
  8  9 existing state or federal programs that fund or supplement
  8 10 the costs to purchase and maintain body cameras worn by peace
  8 11 officers.
  8 12    The bill may include a state mandate as defined in Code

  5 12                           EXPLANATION
  5 13 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  5 14 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  5 15    This bill requires certain peace officers, including tribal
  5 16 law enforcement officers, to wear a body camera.
  5 17    The bill defines "agency" to mean a law enforcement agency.
  5 18    The bill defines "body camera" to mean an electronic device
  5 19 that is capable of recording video and audio data or capable of
  5 20 transmitting video and audio data to be recorded remotely, and
  5 21 is worn on the person of a peace officer.
  5 22    The body camera requirement applies to a county sheriff
  5 23 or deputy sheriff, city peace officer, peace officer member
  5 24 of the department of public safety, peace officer at a
  5 25 regents institution, conservation officer, an employee of the
  5 26 department of transportation designated as a peace officer,
  5 27 an employee of an aviation authority designated as a peace
  5 28 officer, and a certified tribal law enforcement officer.
  5 29    The bill requires a peace officer to wear a body camera
  5 30 at all times while on duty and in uniform.  The bill further
  5 31 requires that the peace officer record all interactions with
  5 32 people in the performance of the official duties of the peace
  5 33 officer from the beginning to the end of those interactions.
  5 34    The bill specifies that a body camera must be worn on the
  5 35 chest or at the eye level of the peace officer.
  6  1 The bill prohibits a body camera from containing facial
  6  2 recognition technology unless the use of such technology has
  6  3 been authorized by the court pursuant to an arrest or search
  6  4 warrant.
  6  5    The bill requires a peace officer to inform a person when
  6  6 that person is being recorded by a body camera unless informing
  6  7 the person would be unsafe, impractical, or impossible.
  6  8    If a peace officer who is wearing a body camera enters a
  6  9 residence without a warrant or where no exigent circumstances
  6 10 exist, the bill requires that the peace officer immediately ask
  6 11 whether the resident desires the peace officer to stop the body
  6 12 camera recording while the peace officer is in the residence.
  6 13 If the person responds in the affirmative, the bill requires
  6 14 the peace officer to stop the body camera recording.  The bill
  6 15 also requires the peace officer to record the question and any
  6 16 answer to the question.
  6 17    If a peace officer wearing a body camera interacts with a
  6 18 person reporting a crime, providing information regarding a
  6 19 crime or ongoing investigation, or claiming to be a victim of a
  6 20 crime, the bill requires the peace officer to immediately ask
  6 21 whether the person desires the peace officer to stop the body
  6 22 camera recording of the interaction.  If the person responds in
  6 23 the affirmative, the bill requires the peace officer to stop
  6 24 the body camera recording.  The bill also requires the peace
  6 25 officer to record the question and any answer to the question.
  6 26    The contents of a recording created by a body camera are
  6 27 confidential except as provided for in the bill.
  6 28    The bill requires that an agency shall retain the contents
  6 29 of a recording created by a body camera for 30 days.  However,
  6 30 an agency shall retain the contents of a recording created by
  6 31 a body camera for three years if any of the following apply:
  6 32 the recording depicts an incident involving the use of force;
  6 33 the recording depicts an incident that leads to detention or
  6 34 arrest of a person; the recording is relevant to a formal
  6 35 or informal complaint against a peace officer or agency; or
  7  1 a request has been made to retain the recording.  Under the
  7  2 bill, the contents of the recording may be retained even longer
  7  3 than three years if the contents may be relevant to a criminal
  7  4 prosecution.
  7  5    Any of the following persons may make a request that the
  7  6 contents of a recording created by a body camera be retained
  7  7 for three years: a person who is a part of the content of the
  7  8 recording; a person whose property has been seized or damaged
  7  9 in relation to, or is otherwise involved with, a crime that is
  7 10 related to the recording; a parent or guardian of a person who
  7 11 is part of the content of the recording or whose property was
  7 12 seized, damaged, or involved with a crime that is related to
  7 13 the recording; the attorney for a person who is part of the
  7 14 content of the recording or whose property was seized, damaged,
  7 15 or involved with a crime that is related to the recording; any
  7 16 other person if such person has been given written authority
  7 17 to disclose the contents of the recording by the person who
  7 18 is part of the content of the recording or whose property was
  7 19 seized or damaged.
  7 20    The bill provides that a person, who is not a part of the
  7 21 content of a recording created by a body camera, may request a
  7 22 copy of and receive such recording if each person who is part
  7 23 of the content of the recording consents in writing.
  7 24    Prior to deleting or disposing of the contents of a recording
  7 25 created by a body camera, the bill requires the person who has
  7 26 the responsibility of deleting or disposing of such a recording
  7 27 on behalf of the agency, to review all applicable and available
  7 28 records, files, and databases to ascertain whether any reason
  7 29 exists that the recording should not be disposed of or deleted.
  7 30    A peace officer who fails to record any interaction with
  7 31 a person or who fails to stop recording such interaction
  7 32 as required by the bill commits a violation. For a first
  7 33 violation of the bill a peace officer shall be given a written
  7 34 reprimand.  For a second or subsequent violation of the bill
  7 35 the peace officer shall be suspended until an investigation
  8  1 into the cause of the violation has been completed.
  8  2    The bill also provides that if an agency is unable to produce
  8  3 a body camera recording during a criminal prosecution or civil
  8  4 action, a rebuttable presumption arises that the recording
  8  5 would corroborate the version of the facts advanced by the
  8  6 defendant in the criminal action or the party opposing the
  8  7 peace officer or agency in the civil action.
  8  8    The bill specifies that an agency shall participate in any
  8  9 existing state or federal programs that fund or supplement
  8 10 the costs to purchase and maintain body cameras worn by peace
  8 11 officers.
  8 12    The bill may include a state mandate as defined in Code

  5 12                           EXPLANATION
  5 13 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  5 14 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  5 15    This bill requires certain peace officers, including tribal
  5 16 law enforcement officers, to wear a body camera.
  5 17    The bill defines "agency" to mean a law enforcement agency.
  5 18    The bill defines "body camera" to mean an electronic device
  5 19 that is capable of recording video and audio data or capable of
  5 20 transmitting video and audio data to be recorded remotely, and
  5 21 is worn on the person of a peace officer.
  5 22    The body camera requirement applies to a county sheriff
  5 23 or deputy sheriff, city peace officer, peace officer member
  5 24 of the department of public safety, peace officer at a
  5 25 regents institution, conservation officer, an employee of the
  5 26 department of transportation designated as a peace officer,
  5 27 an employee of an aviation authority designated as a peace
  5 28 officer, and a certified tribal law enforcement officer.
  5 29    The bill requires a peace officer to wear a body camera
  5 30 at all times while on duty and in uniform.  The bill further
  5 31 requires that the peace officer record all interactions with
  5 32 people in the performance of the official duties of the peace
  5 33 officer from the beginning to the end of those interactions.
  5 34    The bill specifies that a body camera must be worn on the
  5 35 chest or at the eye level of the peace officer.
  6  1 The bill prohibits a body camera from containing facial
  6  2 recognition technology unless the use of such technology has
  6  3 been authorized by the court pursuant to an arrest or search
  6  4 warrant.
  6  5    The bill requires a peace officer to inform a person when
  6  6 that person is being recorded by a body camera unless informing
  6  7 the person would be unsafe, impractical, or impossible.
  6  8    If a peace officer who is wearing a body camera enters a
  6  9 residence without a warrant or where no exigent circumstances
  6 10 exist, the bill requires that the peace officer immediately ask
  6 11 whether the resident desires the peace officer to stop the body
  6 12 camera recording while the peace officer is in the residence.
  6 13 If the person responds in the affirmative, the bill requires
  6 14 the peace officer to stop the body camera recording.  The bill
  6 15 also requires the peace officer to record the question and any
  6 16 answer to the question.
  6 17    If a peace officer wearing a body camera interacts with a
  6 18 person reporting a crime, providing information regarding a
  6 19 crime or ongoing investigation, or claiming to be a victim of a
  6 20 crime, the bill requires the peace officer to immediately ask
  6 21 whether the person desires the peace officer to stop the body
  6 22 camera recording of the interaction.  If the person responds in
  6 23 the affirmative, the bill requires the peace officer to stop
  6 24 the body camera recording.  The bill also requires the peace
  6 25 officer to record the question and any answer to the question.
  6 26    The contents of a recording created by a body camera are
  6 27 confidential except as provided for in the bill.
  6 28    The bill requires that an agency shall retain the contents
  6 29 of a recording created by a body camera for 30 days.  However,
  6 30 an agency shall retain the contents of a recording created by
  6 31 a body camera for three years if any of the following apply:
  6 32 the recording depicts an incident involving the use of force;
  6 33 the recording depicts an incident that leads to detention or
  6 34 arrest of a person; the recording is relevant to a formal
  6 35 or informal complaint against a peace officer or agency; or
  7  1 a request has been made to retain the recording.  Under the
  7  2 bill, the contents of the recording may be retained even longer
  7  3 than three years if the contents may be relevant to a criminal
  7  4 prosecution.
  7  5    Any of the following persons may make a request that the
  7  6 contents of a recording created by a body camera be retained
  7  7 for three years: a person who is a part of the content of the
  7  8 recording; a person whose property has been seized or damaged
  7  9 in relation to, or is otherwise involved with, a crime that is
  7 10 related to the recording; a parent or guardian of a person who
  7 11 is part of the content of the recording or whose property was
  7 12 seized, damaged, or involved with a crime that is related to
  7 13 the recording; the attorney for a person who is part of the
  7 14 content of the recording or whose property was seized, damaged,
  7 15 or involved with a crime that is related to the recording; any
  7 16 other person if such person has been given written authority
  7 17 to disclose the contents of the recording by the person who
  7 18 is part of the content of the recording or whose property was
  7 19 seized or damaged.
  7 20    The bill provides that a person, who is not a part of the
  7 21 content of a recording created by a body camera, may request a
  7 22 copy of and receive such recording if each person who is part
  7 23 of the content of the recording consents in writing.
  7 24    Prior to deleting or disposing of the contents of a recording
  7 25 created by a body camera, the bill requires the person who has
  7 26 the responsibility of deleting or disposing of such a recording
  7 27 on behalf of the agency, to review all applicable and available
  7 28 records, files, and databases to ascertain whether any reason
  7 29 exists that the recording should not be disposed of or deleted.
  7 30    A peace officer who fails to record any interaction with
  7 31 a person or who fails to stop recording such interaction
  7 32 as required by the bill commits a violation. For a first
  7 33 violation of the bill a peace officer shall be given a written
  7 34 reprimand.  For a second or subsequent violation of the bill
  7 35 the peace officer shall be suspended until an investigation
  8  1 into the cause of the violation has been completed.
  8  2    The bill also provides that if an agency is unable to produce
  8  3 a body camera recording during a criminal prosecution or civil
  8  4 action, a rebuttable presumption arises that the recording
  8  5 would corroborate the version of the facts advanced by the
  8  6 defendant in the criminal action or the party opposing the
  8  7 peace officer or agency in the civil action.
  8  8    The bill specifies that an agency shall participate in any
  8  9 existing state or federal programs that fund or supplement
  8 10 the costs to purchase and maintain body cameras worn by peace
  8 11 officers.
  8 12    The bill may include a state mandate as defined in Code
  8 13 section 25B.3.  The bill makes inapplicable Code section 25B.2,
  8 14 subsection 3, which would relieve a political subdivision from
  8 15 complying with a state mandate if funding for the cost of
  8 16 the state mandate is not provided or specified.  Therefore,
  8 17 political subdivisions are required to comply with any state
  8 18 mandate included in the bill.

  5 29    The bill requires a peace officer to wear a body camera
  5 30 at all times while on duty and in uniform.  The bill further
  5 31 requires that the peace officer record all interactions with

  5 33 officer from the beginning to the end of those interactions.
  5 34    The bill specifies that a body camera must be worn on the

  6  4 warrant.
  6  5    The bill requires a peace officer to inform a person when
  6  6 that person is being recorded by a body camera unless informing
  6  7 the person would be unsafe, impractical, or impossible.
  6  8    If a peace officer who is wearing a body camera enters a
  6  9 residence without a warrant or where no exigent circumstances
  6 10 exist, the bill requires that the peace officer immediately ask
  6 11 whether the resident desires the peace officer to stop the body
  6 12 camera recording while the peace officer is in the residence.
  6 13 If the person responds in the affirmative, the bill requires
  6 14 the peace officer to stop the body camera recording.  The bill
  6 15 also requires the peace officer to record the question and any
  6 16 answer to the question.
  6 17    If a peace officer wearing a body camera interacts with a

  6 20 crime, the bill requires the peace officer to immediately ask
  6 21 whether the person desires the peace officer to stop the body
  6 22 camera recording of the interaction.  If the person responds in

  6 27 confidential except as provided for in the bill.
  6 28    The bill requires that an agency shall retain the contents
  6 29 of a recording created by a body camera for 30 days.  However,
  6 30 an agency shall retain the contents of a recording created by
  6 31 a body camera for three years if any of the following apply:
  6 32 the recording depicts an incident involving the use of force;
  6 33 the recording depicts an incident that leads to detention or
  6 34 arrest of a person; the recording is relevant to a formal
  6 35 or informal complaint against a peace officer or agency; or
  7  1 a request has been made to retain the recording.  Under the
  7  2 bill, the contents of the recording may be retained even longer
  7  3 than three years if the contents may be relevant to a criminal
  7  4 prosecution.
  7  5    Any of the following persons may make a request that the
  7  6 contents of a recording created by a body camera be retained
  7  7 for three years: a person who is a part of the content of the
  7  8 recording; a person whose property has been seized or damaged
  7  9 in relation to, or is otherwise involved with, a crime that is
  7 10 related to the recording; a parent or guardian of a person who
  7 11 is part of the content of the recording or whose property was
  7 12 seized, damaged, or involved with a crime that is related to
  7 13 the recording; the attorney for a person who is part of the
  7 14 content of the recording or whose property was seized, damaged,
  7 15 or involved with a crime that is related to the recording; any
  7 16 other person if such person has been given written authority
  7 17 to disclose the contents of the recording by the person who
  7 18 is part of the content of the recording or whose property was
  7 19 seized or damaged.
  7 20    The bill provides that a person, who is not a part of the
  7 21 content of a recording created by a body camera, may request a
  7 22 copy of and receive such recording if each person who is part
  7 23 of the content of the recording consents in writing.
  7 24    Prior to deleting or disposing of the contents of a recording
  7 25 created by a body camera, the bill requires the person who has
  7 26 the responsibility of deleting or disposing of such a recording
  7 27 on behalf of the agency, to review all applicable and available
  7 28 records, files, and databases to ascertain whether any reason
  7 29 exists that the recording should not be disposed of or deleted.
  7 30    A peace officer who fails to record any interaction with
  7 31 a person or who fails to stop recording such interaction
  7 32 as required by the bill commits a violation. For a first
  7 33 violation of the bill a peace officer shall be given a written
  7 34 reprimand.  For a second or subsequent violation of the bill
  7 35 the peace officer shall be suspended until an investigation
  8  1 into the cause of the violation has been completed.
  8  2    The bill also provides that if an agency is unable to produce
  8  3 a body camera recording during a criminal prosecution or civil
  8  4 action, a rebuttable presumption arises that the recording
  8  5 would corroborate the version of the facts advanced by the
  8  6 defendant in the criminal action or the party opposing the
  8  7 peace officer or agency in the civil action.
  8  8    The bill specifies that an agency shall participate in any
  8  9 existing state or federal programs that fund or supplement
  8 10 the costs to purchase and maintain body cameras worn by peace
  8 11 officers.
  8 12    The bill may include a state mandate as defined in Code
  8 13 section 25B.3.  The bill makes inapplicable Code section 25B.2,
  8 14 subsection 3, which would relieve a political subdivision from
  8 15 complying with a state mandate if funding for the cost of
  8 16 the state mandate is not provided or specified.  Therefore,
  8 17 political subdivisions are required to comply with any state
  8 18 mandate included in the bill.

  6 32 the recording depicts an incident involving the use of force;
  6 33 the recording depicts an incident that leads to detention or
  6 34 arrest of a person; the recording is relevant to a formal
  6 35 or informal complaint against a peace officer or agency; or
  7  1 a request has been made to retain the recording.  Under the
  7  2 bill, the contents of the recording may be retained even longer
  7  3 than three years if the contents may be relevant to a criminal
  7  4 prosecution.
  7  5    Any of the following persons may make a request that the

  7  9 in relation to, or is otherwise involved with, a crime that is
  7 10 related to the recording; a parent or guardian of a person who

  7 22 copy of and receive such recording if each person who is part
  7 23 of the content of the recording consents in writing.
  7 24    Prior to deleting or disposing of the contents of a recording
  7 25 created by a body camera, the bill requires the person who has
  7 26 the responsibility of deleting or disposing of such a recording
  7 27 on behalf of the agency, to review all applicable and available
  7 28 records, files, and databases to ascertain whether any reason
  7 29 exists that the recording should not be disposed of or deleted.
  7 30    A peace officer who fails to record any interaction with
  7 31 a person or who fails to stop recording such interaction
  7 32 as required by the bill commits a violation. For a first

  8  7 peace officer or agency in the civil action.
  8  8    The bill specifies that an agency shall participate in any

  8 11 officers.
  8 12    The bill may include a state mandate as defined in Code
  8 13 section 25B.3.  The bill makes inapplicable Code section 25B.2,
  8 14 subsection 3, which would relieve a political subdivision from
  8 15 complying with a state mandate if funding for the cost of
  8 16 the state mandate is not provided or specified.  Therefore,
  8 17 political subdivisions are required to comply with any state

  5 14 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  5 15    This bill requires certain peace officers, including tribal
  5 16 law enforcement officers, to wear a body camera.
  5 17    The bill defines "agency" to mean a law enforcement agency.
  5 18    The bill defines "body camera" to mean an electronic device
  5 19 that is capable of recording video and audio data or capable of
  5 20 transmitting video and audio data to be recorded remotely, and
  5 21 is worn on the person of a peace officer.
  5 22    The body camera requirement applies to a county sheriff
  5 23 or deputy sheriff, city peace officer, peace officer member
  5 24 of the department of public safety, peace officer at a
  5 25 regents institution, conservation officer, an employee of the

  6  6 that person is being recorded by a body camera unless informing
  6  7 the person would be unsafe, impractical, or impossible.
  6  8    If a peace officer who is wearing a body camera enters a
  6  9 residence without a warrant or where no exigent circumstances
  6 10 exist, the bill requires that the peace officer immediately ask
  6 11 whether the resident desires the peace officer to stop the body
  6 12 camera recording while the peace officer is in the residence.
  6 13 If the person responds in the affirmative, the bill requires
  6 14 the peace officer to stop the body camera recording.  The bill
  6 15 also requires the peace officer to record the question and any
  6 16 answer to the question.
  6 17    If a peace officer wearing a body camera interacts with a
  6 18 person reporting a crime, providing information regarding a

  6 20 crime, the bill requires the peace officer to immediately ask
  6 21 whether the person desires the peace officer to stop the body
  6 22 camera recording of the interaction.  If the person responds in

  6 24 the body camera recording.  The bill also requires the peace
  6 25 officer to record the question and any answer to the question.

  6 33 the recording depicts an incident that leads to detention or
  6 34 arrest of a person; the recording is relevant to a formal
  6 35 or informal complaint against a peace officer or agency; or
  7  1 a request has been made to retain the recording.  Under the

  7 17 to disclose the contents of the recording by the person who
  7 18 is part of the content of the recording or whose property was

  7 32 as required by the bill commits a violation. For a first
  7 33 violation of the bill a peace officer shall be given a written
  7 34 reprimand.  For a second or subsequent violation of the bill
  7 35 the peace officer shall be suspended until an investigation
  8  1 into the cause of the violation has been completed.
  8  2    The bill also provides that if an agency is unable to produce
  8  3 a body camera recording during a criminal prosecution or civil
  8  4 action, a rebuttable presumption arises that the recording
  8  5 would corroborate the version of the facts advanced by the
  8  6 defendant in the criminal action or the party opposing the
  8  7 peace officer or agency in the civil action.
  8  8    The bill specifies that an agency shall participate in any

  8 11 officers.
  8 12    The bill may include a state mandate as defined in Code
  8 13 section 25B.3.  The bill makes inapplicable Code section 25B.2,
  8 14 subsection 3, which would relieve a political subdivision from
  8 15 complying with a state mandate if funding for the cost of
  8 16 the state mandate is not provided or specified.  Therefore,
  8 17 political subdivisions are required to comply with any state
  8 18 mandate included in the bill.

  5 12                           EXPLANATION
  5 13 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  5 14 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  5 15    This bill requires certain peace officers, including tribal
  5 16 law enforcement officers, to wear a body camera.
  5 17    The bill defines "agency" to mean a law enforcement agency.
  5 18    The bill defines "body camera" to mean an electronic device
  5 19 that is capable of recording video and audio data or capable of
  5 20 transmitting video and audio data to be recorded remotely, and
  5 21 is worn on the person of a peace officer.
  5 22    The body camera requirement applies to a county sheriff
  5 23 or deputy sheriff, city peace officer, peace officer member
  5 24 of the department of public safety, peace officer at a
  5 25 regents institution, conservation officer, an employee of the
  5 26 department of transportation designated as a peace officer,
  5 27 an employee of an aviation authority designated as a peace
  5 28 officer, and a certified tribal law enforcement officer.
  5 29    The bill requires a peace officer to wear a body camera
  5 30 at all times while on duty and in uniform.  The bill further
  5 31 requires that the peace officer record all interactions with
  5 32 people in the performance of the official duties of the peace
  5 33 officer from the beginning to the end of those interactions.
  5 34    The bill specifies that a body camera must be worn on the
  5 35 chest or at the eye level of the peace officer.
  6  1 The bill prohibits a body camera from containing facial
  6  2 recognition technology unless the use of such technology has
  6  3 been authorized by the court pursuant to an arrest or search
  6  4 warrant.
  6  5    The bill requires a peace officer to inform a person when
  6  6 that person is being recorded by a body camera unless informing
  6  7 the person would be unsafe, impractical, or impossible.
  6  8    If a peace officer who is wearing a body camera enters a
  6  9 residence without a warrant or where no exigent circumstances
  6 10 exist, the bill requires that the peace officer immediately ask
  6 11 whether the resident desires the peace officer to stop the body
  6 12 camera recording while the peace officer is in the residence.
  6 13 If the person responds in the affirmative, the bill requires
  6 14 the peace officer to stop the body camera recording.  The bill
  6 15 also requires the peace officer to record the question and any
  6 16 answer to the question.
  6 17    If a peace officer wearing a body camera interacts with a
  6 18 person reporting a crime, providing information regarding a
  6 19 crime or ongoing investigation, or claiming to be a victim of a
  6 20 crime, the bill requires the peace officer to immediately ask
  6 21 whether the person desires the peace officer to stop the body
  6 22 camera recording of the interaction.  If the person responds in
  6 23 the affirmative, the bill requires the peace officer to stop
  6 24 the body camera recording.  The bill also requires the peace
  6 25 officer to record the question and any answer to the question.
  6 26    The contents of a recording created by a body camera are
  6 27 confidential except as provided for in the bill.
  6 28    The bill requires that an agency shall retain the contents
  6 29 of a recording created by a body camera for 30 days.  However,
  6 30 an agency shall retain the contents of a recording created by
  6 31 a body camera for three years if any of the following apply:
  6 32 the recording depicts an incident involving the use of force;
  6 33 the recording depicts an incident that leads to detention or
  6 34 arrest of a person; the recording is relevant to a formal
  6 35 or informal complaint against a peace officer or agency; or
  7  1 a request has been made to retain the recording.  Under the
  7  2 bill, the contents of the recording may be retained even longer
  7  3 than three years if the contents may be relevant to a criminal
  7  4 prosecution.
  7  5    Any of the following persons may make a request that the
  7  6 contents of a recording created by a body camera be retained
  7  7 for three years: a person who is a part of the content of the
  7  8 recording; a person whose property has been seized or damaged
  7  9 in relation to, or is otherwise involved with, a crime that is
  7 10 related to the recording; a parent or guardian of a person who
  7 11 is part of the content of the recording or whose property was
  7 12 seized, damaged, or involved with a crime that is related to
  7 13 the recording; the attorney for a person who is part of the
  7 14 content of the recording or whose property was seized, damaged,
  7 15 or involved with a crime that is related to the recording; any
  7 16 other person if such person has been given written authority
  7 17 to disclose the contents of the recording by the person who
  7 18 is part of the content of the recording or whose property was
  7 19 seized or damaged.
  7 20    The bill provides that a person, who is not a part of the
  7 21 content of a recording created by a body camera, may request a
  7 22 copy of and receive such recording if each person who is part
  7 23 of the content of the recording consents in writing.
  7 24    Prior to deleting or disposing of the contents of a recording
  7 25 created by a body camera, the bill requires the person who has
  7 26 the responsibility of deleting or disposing of such a recording
  7 27 on behalf of the agency, to review all applicable and available
  7 28 records, files, and databases to ascertain whether any reason
  7 29 exists that the recording should not be disposed of or deleted.
  7 30    A peace officer who fails to record any interaction with
  7 31 a person or who fails to stop recording such interaction
  7 32 as required by the bill commits a violation. For a first
  7 33 violation of the bill a peace officer shall be given a written
  7 34 reprimand.  For a second or subsequent violation of the bill
  7 35 the peace officer shall be suspended until an investigation
  8  1 into the cause of the violation has been completed.
  8  2    The bill also provides that if an agency is unable to produce
  8  3 a body camera recording during a criminal prosecution or civil
  8  4 action, a rebuttable presumption arises that the recording
  8  5 would corroborate the version of the facts advanced by the
  8  6 defendant in the criminal action or the party opposing the
  8  7 peace officer or agency in the civil action.
  8  8    The bill specifies that an agency shall participate in any
  8  9 existing state or federal programs that fund or supplement
  8 10 the costs to purchase and maintain body cameras worn by peace
  8 11 officers.
  8 12    The bill may include a state mandate as defined in Code
  8 13 section 25B.3.  The bill makes inapplicable Code section 25B.2,
  8 14 subsection 3, which would relieve a political subdivision from
  8 15 complying with a state mandate if funding for the cost of
  8 16 the state mandate is not provided or specified.  Therefore,
  8 17 political subdivisions are required to comply with any state
  8 18 mandate included in the bill.

  6  4 warrant.
  6  5    The bill requires a peace officer to inform a person when
  6  6 that person is being recorded by a body camera unless informing
  6  7 the person would be unsafe, impractical, or impossible.
  6  8    If a peace officer who is wearing a body camera enters a
  6  9 residence without a warrant or where no exigent circumstances
  6 10 exist, the bill requires that the peace officer immediately ask
  6 11 whether the resident desires the peace officer to stop the body
  6 12 camera recording while the peace officer is in the residence.
  6 13 If the person responds in the affirmative, the bill requires
  6 14 the peace officer to stop the body camera recording.  The bill
  6 15 also requires the peace officer to record the question and any
  6 16 answer to the question.
  6 17    If a peace officer wearing a body camera interacts with a
  6 18 person reporting a crime, providing information regarding a
  6 19 crime or ongoing investigation, or claiming to be a victim of a
  6 20 crime, the bill requires the peace officer to immediately ask
  6 21 whether the person desires the peace officer to stop the body
  6 22 camera recording of the interaction.  If the person responds in
  6 23 the affirmative, the bill requires the peace officer to stop
  6 24 the body camera recording.  The bill also requires the peace
  6 25 officer to record the question and any answer to the question.
  6 26    The contents of a recording created by a body camera are
  6 27 confidential except as provided for in the bill.
  6 28    The bill requires that an agency shall retain the contents
  6 29 of a recording created by a body camera for 30 days.  However,
  6 30 an agency shall retain the contents of a recording created by
  6 31 a body camera for three years if any of the following apply:
  6 32 the recording depicts an incident involving the use of force;
  6 33 the recording depicts an incident that leads to detention or
  6 34 arrest of a person; the recording is relevant to a formal
  6 35 or informal complaint against a peace officer or agency; or
  7  1 a request has been made to retain the recording.  Under the
  7  2 bill, the contents of the recording may be retained even longer
  7  3 than three years if the contents may be relevant to a criminal
  7  4 prosecution.
  7  5    Any of the following persons may make a request that the
  7  6 contents of a recording created by a body camera be retained
  7  7 for three years: a person who is a part of the content of the
  7  8 recording; a person whose property has been seized or damaged
  7  9 in relation to, or is otherwise involved with, a crime that is
  7 10 related to the recording; a parent or guardian of a person who
  7 11 is part of the content of the recording or whose property was
  7 12 seized, damaged, or involved with a crime that is related to
  7 13 the recording; the attorney for a person who is part of the
  7 14 content of the recording or whose property was seized, damaged,
  7 15 or involved with a crime that is related to the recording; any
  7 16 other person if such person has been given written authority
  7 17 to disclose the contents of the recording by the person who
  7 18 is part of the content of the recording or whose property was
  7 19 seized or damaged.
  7 20    The bill provides that a person, who is not a part of the
  7 21 content of a recording created by a body camera, may request a
  7 22 copy of and receive such recording if each person who is part
  7 23 of the content of the recording consents in writing.
  7 24    Prior to deleting or disposing of the contents of a recording
  7 25 created by a body camera, the bill requires the person who has
  7 26 the responsibility of deleting or disposing of such a recording
  7 27 on behalf of the agency, to review all applicable and available
  7 28 records, files, and databases to ascertain whether any reason
  7 29 exists that the recording should not be disposed of or deleted.
  7 30    A peace officer who fails to record any interaction with
  7 31 a person or who fails to stop recording such interaction
  7 32 as required by the bill commits a violation. For a first
  7 33 violation of the bill a peace officer shall be given a written
  7 34 reprimand.  For a second or subsequent violation of the bill
  7 35 the peace officer shall be suspended until an investigation
  8  1 into the cause of the violation has been completed.
  8  2    The bill also provides that if an agency is unable to produce
  8  3 a body camera recording during a criminal prosecution or civil
  8  4 action, a rebuttable presumption arises that the recording
  8  5 would corroborate the version of the facts advanced by the
  8  6 defendant in the criminal action or the party opposing the
  8  7 peace officer or agency in the civil action.
  8  8    The bill specifies that an agency shall participate in any
  8  9 existing state or federal programs that fund or supplement
  8 10 the costs to purchase and maintain body cameras worn by peace
  8 11 officers.
  8 12    The bill may include a state mandate as defined in Code
  8 13 section 25B.3.  The bill makes inapplicable Code section 25B.2,
  8 14 subsection 3, which would relieve a political subdivision from
  8 15 complying with a state mandate if funding for the cost of
  8 16 the state mandate is not provided or specified.  Therefore,
  8 17 political subdivisions are required to comply with any state

  6  5    The bill requires a peace officer to inform a person when
  6  6 that person is being recorded by a body camera unless informing
  6  7 the person would be unsafe, impractical, or impossible.
  6  8    If a peace officer who is wearing a body camera enters a
  6  9 residence without a warrant or where no exigent circumstances
  6 10 exist, the bill requires that the peace officer immediately ask

  6 24 the body camera recording.  The bill also requires the peace
  6 25 officer to record the question and any answer to the question.
  6 26    The contents of a recording created by a body camera are
  6 27 confidential except as provided for in the bill.
  6 28    The bill requires that an agency shall retain the contents

  6 33 the recording depicts an incident that leads to detention or
  6 34 arrest of a person; the recording is relevant to a formal
  6 35 or informal complaint against a peace officer or agency; or
  7  1 a request has been made to retain the recording.  Under the
  7  2 bill, the contents of the recording may be retained even longer
  7  3 than three years if the contents may be relevant to a criminal
  7  4 prosecution.
  7  5    Any of the following persons may make a request that the
  7  6 contents of a recording created by a body camera be retained
  7  7 for three years: a person who is a part of the content of the
  7  8 recording; a person whose property has been seized or damaged

  7 26 the responsibility of deleting or disposing of such a recording
  7 27 on behalf of the agency, to review all applicable and available

  7 30    A peace officer who fails to record any interaction with
  7 31 a person or who fails to stop recording such interaction
  7 32 as required by the bill commits a violation. For a first
  7 33 violation of the bill a peace officer shall be given a written
  7 34 reprimand.  For a second or subsequent violation of the bill
  7 35 the peace officer shall be suspended until an investigation
  8  1 into the cause of the violation has been completed.
  8  2    The bill also provides that if an agency is unable to produce

  8  4 action, a rebuttable presumption arises that the recording
  8  5 would corroborate the version of the facts advanced by the
  8  6 defendant in the criminal action or the party opposing the

  8  8    The bill specifies that an agency shall participate in any
  8  9 existing state or federal programs that fund or supplement
  8 10 the costs to purchase and maintain body cameras worn by peace
  8 11 officers.
  8 12    The bill may include a state mandate as defined in Code

  8 14 subsection 3, which would relieve a political subdivision from

  7 27 on behalf of the agency, to review all applicable and available
  7 28 records, files, and databases to ascertain whether any reason
  7 29 exists that the recording should not be disposed of or deleted.
  7 30    A peace officer who fails to record any interaction with
  7 31 a person or who fails to stop recording such interaction
  7 32 as required by the bill commits a violation. For a first
  7 33 violation of the bill a peace officer shall be given a written
  7 34 reprimand.  For a second or subsequent violation of the bill
  7 35 the peace officer shall be suspended until an investigation
  8  1 into the cause of the violation has been completed.
  8  2    The bill also provides that if an agency is unable to produce
  8  3 a body camera recording during a criminal prosecution or civil
  8  4 action, a rebuttable presumption arises that the recording
  8  5 would corroborate the version of the facts advanced by the
  8  6 defendant in the criminal action or the party opposing the
  8  7 peace officer or agency in the civil action.
  8  8    The bill specifies that an agency shall participate in any
  8  9 existing state or federal programs that fund or supplement
  8 10 the costs to purchase and maintain body cameras worn by peace
  8 11 officers.
  8 12    The bill may include a state mandate as defined in Code
  8 13 section 25B.3.  The bill makes inapplicable Code section 25B.2,
  8 14 subsection 3, which would relieve a political subdivision from
  8 15 complying with a state mandate if funding for the cost of
  8 16 the state mandate is not provided or specified.  Therefore,
  8 17 political subdivisions are required to comply with any state
  8 18 mandate included in the bill.

  5 17    The bill defines "agency" to mean a law enforcement agency.
  5 18    The bill defines "body camera" to mean an electronic device
  5 19 that is capable of recording video and audio data or capable of

  5 24 of the department of public safety, peace officer at a
  5 25 regents institution, conservation officer, an employee of the

  5 31 requires that the peace officer record all interactions with
  5 32 people in the performance of the official duties of the peace
  5 33 officer from the beginning to the end of those interactions.
  5 34    The bill specifies that a body camera must be worn on the
  5 35 chest or at the eye level of the peace officer.
  6  1 The bill prohibits a body camera from containing facial

  6  5    The bill requires a peace officer to inform a person when
  6  6 that person is being recorded by a body camera unless informing
  6  7 the person would be unsafe, impractical, or impossible.
  6  8    If a peace officer who is wearing a body camera enters a
  6  9 residence without a warrant or where no exigent circumstances
  6 10 exist, the bill requires that the peace officer immediately ask
  6 11 whether the resident desires the peace officer to stop the body
  6 12 camera recording while the peace officer is in the residence.
  6 13 If the person responds in the affirmative, the bill requires
  6 14 the peace officer to stop the body camera recording.  The bill
  6 15 also requires the peace officer to record the question and any
  6 16 answer to the question.

  6 20 crime, the bill requires the peace officer to immediately ask
  6 21 whether the person desires the peace officer to stop the body
  6 22 camera recording of the interaction.  If the person responds in
  6 23 the affirmative, the bill requires the peace officer to stop
  6 24 the body camera recording.  The bill also requires the peace
  6 25 officer to record the question and any answer to the question.
  6 26    The contents of a recording created by a body camera are
  6 27 confidential except as provided for in the bill.
  6 28    The bill requires that an agency shall retain the contents
  6 29 of a recording created by a body camera for 30 days.  However,

  6 32 the recording depicts an incident involving the use of force;
  6 33 the recording depicts an incident that leads to detention or
  6 34 arrest of a person; the recording is relevant to a formal
  6 35 or informal complaint against a peace officer or agency; or
  7  1 a request has been made to retain the recording.  Under the
  7  2 bill, the contents of the recording may be retained even longer
  7  3 than three years if the contents may be relevant to a criminal
  7  4 prosecution.
  7  5    Any of the following persons may make a request that the
  7  6 contents of a recording created by a body camera be retained
  7  7 for three years: a person who is a part of the content of the
  7  8 recording; a person whose property has been seized or damaged
  7  9 in relation to, or is otherwise involved with, a crime that is
  7 10 related to the recording; a parent or guardian of a person who

  7 12 seized, damaged, or involved with a crime that is related to
  7 13 the recording; the attorney for a person who is part of the
  7 14 content of the recording or whose property was seized, damaged,
  7 15 or involved with a crime that is related to the recording; any

  7 17 to disclose the contents of the recording by the person who
  7 18 is part of the content of the recording or whose property was
  7 19 seized or damaged.
  7 20    The bill provides that a person, who is not a part of the
  7 21 content of a recording created by a body camera, may request a
  7 22 copy of and receive such recording if each person who is part
  7 23 of the content of the recording consents in writing.
  7 24    Prior to deleting or disposing of the contents of a recording
  7 25 created by a body camera, the bill requires the person who has
  7 26 the responsibility of deleting or disposing of such a recording
  7 27 on behalf of the agency, to review all applicable and available
  7 28 records, files, and databases to ascertain whether any reason

  6  5    The bill requires a peace officer to inform a person when
  6  6 that person is being recorded by a body camera unless informing

  6  8    If a peace officer who is wearing a body camera enters a
  6  9 residence without a warrant or where no exigent circumstances
  6 10 exist, the bill requires that the peace officer immediately ask
  6 11 whether the resident desires the peace officer to stop the body
  6 12 camera recording while the peace officer is in the residence.

  7 26 the responsibility of deleting or disposing of such a recording
  7 27 on behalf of the agency, to review all applicable and available
  7 28 records, files, and databases to ascertain whether any reason

  7 30    A peace officer who fails to record any interaction with
  7 31 a person or who fails to stop recording such interaction
  7 32 as required by the bill commits a violation. For a first
  7 33 violation of the bill a peace officer shall be given a written
