  2 21                           EXPLANATION
  2 22 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  2 23 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  2 24    This bill provides immunity from alcohol=related offenses
  2 25 for persons under the legal age who seek medical assistance for
  2 26 a person due to alcohol consumption and for persons under the
  2 27 legal age who seek such assistance or for whom such assistance
  2 28 is sought.
  2 29    Under Code section 123.47, a person under the age of 21
  2 30 shall not purchase, consume, or possess alcoholic liquor, wine,
  2 31 or beer; shall not sell, give, or otherwise supply alcoholic
  2 32 liquor, wine, or beer to a person under the legal age; and
  2 33 shall not, if in control of property that is not a licensed
  2 34 premises, permit a person under the age of 18 to consume or
  2 35 possess any alcoholic liquor, wine, or beer on such property.
  3  1 The bill provides immunity from Code section 123.47 for
  3  2 underage persons who seek medical assistance for a person
  3  3 due to alcohol consumption and to underage persons who seek
  3  4 such assistance or for whom such assistance is sought, if the
  3  5 evidence for the charge was obtained as a result of the seeking
  3  6 of medical assistance.
  3  7    Under Code section 232.52, a juvenile court may suspend or
  3  8 revoke the driver's license or operating privilege of a person
  3  9 under the age of 18, for a period of one year, who has violated
  3 10 Code section 123.47. Because the bill provides immunity to
  3 11 persons from Code section 123.47, a person under the age of 18
  3 12 who receives immunity from prosecution under the bill will not
  3 13 face the loss of such person's driver's license for one year.
  3 14    The bill provides that if a person is immune from prosecution
  3 15 from Code section 123.47, the person is also immune from
  3 16 prosecution under Code sections 321.216B (use of driver's
  3 17 license or nonoperator's identification card by underage person
  3 18 to obtain alcohol), 321.284 (open containers in motor vehicles
  3 19 == drivers), and 321.284A (open containers in motor vehicles
  3 20 == passengers).
  3 21    The bill specifies that the immunity provided shall not
  3 22 be grounds to suppress evidence in other criminal charges
  3 23 except for violations of Code sections 321.216B, 321.284, and
  3 24 321.284A.
  3 25    The bill provides that if a person under the age of 18 is
  3 26 discovered consuming or to be in possession of alcohol but
  3 27 receives immunity from prosecution under Code section 123.47,
  3 28 a peace officer shall notify a juvenile court officer of
  3 29 such person's consumption or possession. Under Code section
  3 30 123.47B(2), the juvenile court officer is required to notify
  3 31 the person's custodial parent, legal guardian, or custodian and
  3 32 the superintendent of authority in charge of the school the
  3 33 person attends of the consumption or possession.
