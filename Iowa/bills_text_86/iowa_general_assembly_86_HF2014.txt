  3  4 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  3  5 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  3  6    This bill prohibits the rafting of vessels within specified
  3  7 distances from the shoreline of a public body of water.
  3  8 "Rafting" is defined to mean the anchoring, tying, fastening,
  3  9 linking, or joining of any combination of three or more vessels
  3 10 together.
  3 11    The bill allows rafting near the shoreline of a public
  3 12 body of water under the following circumstances: rafting of
  3 13 three to 10 vessels shall be conducted at least 100 yards
  3 14 from the shoreline and such vessels shall be located at least
  3 15 200 yards from any other vessel or group of vessels that are
  3 16 tied or anchored together, and rafting of 11 or more vessels
  3 17 shall be conducted at least 300 yards from the shoreline.  The
  3 18 bill also provides that two vessels may be tied or anchored
  3 19 together within 100 yards of the shoreline, but such vessels
  3 20 must be located at least 50 yards from any other vessel or any
  3 21 other group of vessels tied or anchored together.  If these
  3 22 provisions are violated, a peace officer may order all vessels
  3 23 within 300 yards of the shoreline to disperse if the peace
  3 24 officer is unable to determine which vessels were in the area
  3 25 first.
  3 26    The bill allows the natural resource commission, by rules
  3 27 adopted pursuant to Code chapter 17A, to designate areas within
  3 28 300 feet of the shoreline of a public body of water within
  3 29 which rafting or anchoring is prohibited. The department
  3 30 of natural resources shall post signage to that effect
  3 31 which states that there is a $500 fine for violation of the
  3 32 prohibition.
  3 33    The bill also allows the commission to issue a special
  3 34 event permit allowing rafting or anchoring in prohibited areas
  3 35 if the applicant gives assurance that the applicant will
  4  1 take reasonable care that persons or boaters in the vicinity
  4  2 of the event will not be subjected to unreasonably loud or
  4  3 disturbing noise, that event participants will not engage in
  4  4 any disorderly conduct, and that any islands used during the
  4  5 event will be cleaned up after the event ends.  An application
  4  6 for a permit may be denied if the applicant has previously
  4  7 been issued a permit for an event which resulted in a serious
  4  8 complaint from a person or boater in the vicinity of the event
  4  9 or a response to the event from a peace officer.
  4 10    The application for a special event permit must be submitted
