  5 34                           EXPLANATION
  5 35 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  6  1 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  6  2    This bill relates to the statewide preschool program for
  6  3 four=year=old children by establishing a preschool program
  6  4 expansion incentive and authorizing state aid for the
  6  5 incentive. The bill also addresses costs allowed under the
  6  6 program.
  6  7    Code section 256C.3, relating to preschool program
  6  8 requirements, is amended to require each school district to
  6  9 implement a plan for the school district's preschool program to
  6 10 have sufficient capacity to operate without a waiting list for
  6 11 school budget years beginning on or after July 1, 2018.
  6 12    To be eligible for the preschool expansion incentive,
  6 13 a school district must develop and implement a preschool
  6 14 expansion plan, approved by the department, in order to expand
  6 15 enrollment of eligible students in the school district's
  6 16 preschool programming.  Requirements for the plan are
  6 17 provided in the bill, including how the school district will
  6 18 collaborate with participating families, early care providers,
  6 19 and community partners to expand the district's preschool
  6 20 enrollment.  The department of education is to specify other
  6 21 requirements for the plan and for approval of plans by the
  6 22 department. The bill requires the department of education to
  6 23 analyze the enhancements to the preschool program following the
  6 24 incentives period and submit a report to the general assembly.
  6 25    Current law in Code section 256C.4 prohibits inclusion
  6 26 in the preschool program of children already included in a
  6 27 school's enrollment count for purposes of the school aid
  6 28 foundation formula or children who are served by an existing
  6 29 preschool program already receiving state or federal funds for
  6 30 the purpose of providing four=year=old preschool programming
  6 31 while the child is being served by the existing program.  The
  6 32 bill allows inclusion of children participating in an existing
  6 33 program if the preschool programming in the existing program
  6 34 has been enhanced as part of the expansion incentive.
  6 35    The incentive program will operate for the three school
  7  1 budget years beginning July 1, 2016, July 1, 2017, and July
  7  2 1, 2018.  For those three budget years, a school district is
  7  3 eligible to receive incentive state aid for the increase in
  7  4 the actual enrollment of eligible students in the preschool
  7  5 programming provided by a school district in the immediately
  7  6 preceding school year over the base incentive enrollment.
  7  7 The base incentive enrollment is the average of the actual
  7  8 enrollments of eligible students in the school district's
  7  9 preschool programming on October 1, 2012, October 1, 2013,
  7 10 and October 1, 2014.  The amount of incentive state aid is
  7 11 equal to 20 percent of the regular program state cost per pupil
  7 12 multiplied by the school district's incentive enrollment in the
  7 13 base year.
  7 14    The incentive state aid is required to be used to defray
  7 15 increases in costs in connection with the school district's
  7 16 preschool expansion plan.  Such costs may include renovation
  7 17 and other facility costs connected with expansion, outreach,
  7 18 one=time expenses, and other costs identified as eligible by
  7 19 the department.
  7 20    The bill also addresses administration and other costs under
  7 21 the preschool program in amendments to Code sections 256C.3 and
  7 22 256C.4. Authorization is provided for a school district to
  7 23 transport the children participating in the preschool program
  7 24 to and from activities associated with the program along with
  7 25 other children. The bill authorizes community=based providers
  7 26 to prorate the costs of transporting children participating in
  7 27 the preschool program. The allowable administrative costs for
  7 28 school districts are increased from 5 to 10 percent. Also, the
  7 29 costs of outreach activities and facility rent are permitted
  7 30 as administrative costs.
  7 31    The bill may include a state mandate as defined in Code
  7 32 section 25B.3.  The bill requires that the state cost of
  7 33 any state mandate included in the bill be paid by a school
  7 34 district from state school foundation aid received by the
  7 35 school district under Code section 257.16.  The specification
  8  1 is deemed to constitute state compliance with any state mandate
  8  2 funding=related requirements of Code section 25B.2.  The
  8  3 inclusion of this specification is intended to reinstate the
  8  4 requirement of political subdivisions to comply with any state
  8  5 mandates included in the bill.

  5 24 with section 25B.2, subsection 3, the state cost of requiring
  5 25 compliance with any state mandate included in this Act shall

  5 34                           EXPLANATION
  5 35 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  6  1 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  6  2    This bill relates to the statewide preschool program for
  6  3 four=year=old children by establishing a preschool program
  6  4 expansion incentive and authorizing state aid for the
  6  5 incentive. The bill also addresses costs allowed under the
  6  6 program.
  6  7    Code section 256C.3, relating to preschool program
  6  8 requirements, is amended to require each school district to
  6  9 implement a plan for the school district's preschool program to
  6 10 have sufficient capacity to operate without a waiting list for
  6 11 school budget years beginning on or after July 1, 2018.
  6 12    To be eligible for the preschool expansion incentive,
  6 13 a school district must develop and implement a preschool
  6 14 expansion plan, approved by the department, in order to expand
  6 15 enrollment of eligible students in the school district's
  6 16 preschool programming.  Requirements for the plan are
  6 17 provided in the bill, including how the school district will
  6 18 collaborate with participating families, early care providers,
  6 19 and community partners to expand the district's preschool
  6 20 enrollment.  The department of education is to specify other
  6 21 requirements for the plan and for approval of plans by the
  6 22 department. The bill requires the department of education to
  6 23 analyze the enhancements to the preschool program following the
  6 24 incentives period and submit a report to the general assembly.
  6 25    Current law in Code section 256C.4 prohibits inclusion
  6 26 in the preschool program of children already included in a
  6 27 school's enrollment count for purposes of the school aid
  6 28 foundation formula or children who are served by an existing
  6 29 preschool program already receiving state or federal funds for
  6 30 the purpose of providing four=year=old preschool programming
  6 31 while the child is being served by the existing program.  The
  6 32 bill allows inclusion of children participating in an existing
  6 33 program if the preschool programming in the existing program
  6 34 has been enhanced as part of the expansion incentive.
  6 35    The incentive program will operate for the three school
  7  1 budget years beginning July 1, 2016, July 1, 2017, and July
  7  2 1, 2018.  For those three budget years, a school district is
  7  3 eligible to receive incentive state aid for the increase in
  7  4 the actual enrollment of eligible students in the preschool
  7  5 programming provided by a school district in the immediately
  7  6 preceding school year over the base incentive enrollment.
  7  7 The base incentive enrollment is the average of the actual
  7  8 enrollments of eligible students in the school district's
  7  9 preschool programming on October 1, 2012, October 1, 2013,
  7 10 and October 1, 2014.  The amount of incentive state aid is
  7 11 equal to 20 percent of the regular program state cost per pupil
  7 12 multiplied by the school district's incentive enrollment in the
  7 13 base year.
  7 14    The incentive state aid is required to be used to defray
  7 15 increases in costs in connection with the school district's
  7 16 preschool expansion plan.  Such costs may include renovation
  7 17 and other facility costs connected with expansion, outreach,
  7 18 one=time expenses, and other costs identified as eligible by
  7 19 the department.
  7 20    The bill also addresses administration and other costs under
  7 21 the preschool program in amendments to Code sections 256C.3 and
  7 22 256C.4. Authorization is provided for a school district to
  7 23 transport the children participating in the preschool program
  7 24 to and from activities associated with the program along with
  7 25 other children. The bill authorizes community=based providers
  7 26 to prorate the costs of transporting children participating in
  7 27 the preschool program. The allowable administrative costs for
  7 28 school districts are increased from 5 to 10 percent. Also, the
  7 29 costs of outreach activities and facility rent are permitted
  7 30 as administrative costs.
  7 31    The bill may include a state mandate as defined in Code
  7 32 section 25B.3.  The bill requires that the state cost of
  7 33 any state mandate included in the bill be paid by a school
  7 34 district from state school foundation aid received by the
  7 35 school district under Code section 257.16.  The specification
  8  1 is deemed to constitute state compliance with any state mandate
  8  2 funding=related requirements of Code section 25B.2.  The
  8  3 inclusion of this specification is intended to reinstate the
  8  4 requirement of political subdivisions to comply with any state
  8  5 mandates included in the bill.

  7  2 1, 2018.  For those three budget years, a school district is
  7  3 eligible to receive incentive state aid for the increase in
  7  4 the actual enrollment of eligible students in the preschool
  7  5 programming provided by a school district in the immediately
  7  6 preceding school year over the base incentive enrollment.
  7  7 The base incentive enrollment is the average of the actual
  7  8 enrollments of eligible students in the school district's
  7  9 preschool programming on October 1, 2012, October 1, 2013,
  7 10 and October 1, 2014.  The amount of incentive state aid is
  7 11 equal to 20 percent of the regular program state cost per pupil
  7 12 multiplied by the school district's incentive enrollment in the
  7 13 base year.
  7 14    The incentive state aid is required to be used to defray
  7 15 increases in costs in connection with the school district's
  7 16 preschool expansion plan.  Such costs may include renovation
  7 17 and other facility costs connected with expansion, outreach,
  7 18 one=time expenses, and other costs identified as eligible by
  7 19 the department.
  7 20    The bill also addresses administration and other costs under
  7 21 the preschool program in amendments to Code sections 256C.3 and
  7 22 256C.4. Authorization is provided for a school district to
  7 23 transport the children participating in the preschool program
  7 24 to and from activities associated with the program along with
  7 25 other children. The bill authorizes community=based providers
  7 26 to prorate the costs of transporting children participating in
  7 27 the preschool program. The allowable administrative costs for
  7 28 school districts are increased from 5 to 10 percent. Also, the
  7 29 costs of outreach activities and facility rent are permitted
  7 30 as administrative costs.
  7 31    The bill may include a state mandate as defined in Code
  7 32 section 25B.3.  The bill requires that the state cost of
  7 33 any state mandate included in the bill be paid by a school
  7 34 district from state school foundation aid received by the
  7 35 school district under Code section 257.16.  The specification
  8  1 is deemed to constitute state compliance with any state mandate
  8  2 funding=related requirements of Code section 25B.2.  The
  8  3 inclusion of this specification is intended to reinstate the
  8  4 requirement of political subdivisions to comply with any state
  8  5 mandates included in the bill.

  5 35 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  6  1 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  6  2    This bill relates to the statewide preschool program for
  6  3 four=year=old children by establishing a preschool program
  6  4 expansion incentive and authorizing state aid for the
  6  5 incentive. The bill also addresses costs allowed under the
  6  6 program.
  6  7    Code section 256C.3, relating to preschool program
  6  8 requirements, is amended to require each school district to
  6  9 implement a plan for the school district's preschool program to
  6 10 have sufficient capacity to operate without a waiting list for
  6 11 school budget years beginning on or after July 1, 2018.
  6 12    To be eligible for the preschool expansion incentive,
  6 13 a school district must develop and implement a preschool
  6 14 expansion plan, approved by the department, in order to expand
  6 15 enrollment of eligible students in the school district's
  6 16 preschool programming.  Requirements for the plan are
  6 17 provided in the bill, including how the school district will
  6 18 collaborate with participating families, early care providers,
  6 19 and community partners to expand the district's preschool
  6 20 enrollment.  The department of education is to specify other
  6 21 requirements for the plan and for approval of plans by the
  6 22 department. The bill requires the department of education to
  6 23 analyze the enhancements to the preschool program following the
  6 24 incentives period and submit a report to the general assembly.
  6 25    Current law in Code section 256C.4 prohibits inclusion
  6 26 in the preschool program of children already included in a
  6 27 school's enrollment count for purposes of the school aid
  6 28 foundation formula or children who are served by an existing
  6 29 preschool program already receiving state or federal funds for
  6 30 the purpose of providing four=year=old preschool programming
  6 31 while the child is being served by the existing program.  The
  6 32 bill allows inclusion of children participating in an existing
  6 33 program if the preschool programming in the existing program
  6 34 has been enhanced as part of the expansion incentive.
  6 35    The incentive program will operate for the three school
  7  1 budget years beginning July 1, 2016, July 1, 2017, and July
  7  2 1, 2018.  For those three budget years, a school district is
  7  3 eligible to receive incentive state aid for the increase in
  7  4 the actual enrollment of eligible students in the preschool
  7  5 programming provided by a school district in the immediately

  7  7 The base incentive enrollment is the average of the actual
  7  8 enrollments of eligible students in the school district's
  7  9 preschool programming on October 1, 2012, October 1, 2013,
  7 10 and October 1, 2014.  The amount of incentive state aid is
  7 11 equal to 20 percent of the regular program state cost per pupil
  7 12 multiplied by the school district's incentive enrollment in the
  7 13 base year.
  7 14    The incentive state aid is required to be used to defray
  7 15 increases in costs in connection with the school district's
  7 16 preschool expansion plan.  Such costs may include renovation
  7 17 and other facility costs connected with expansion, outreach,
  7 18 one=time expenses, and other costs identified as eligible by
  7 19 the department.
  7 20    The bill also addresses administration and other costs under
  7 21 the preschool program in amendments to Code sections 256C.3 and
  7 22 256C.4. Authorization is provided for a school district to
  7 23 transport the children participating in the preschool program
  7 24 to and from activities associated with the program along with
  7 25 other children. The bill authorizes community=based providers
  7 26 to prorate the costs of transporting children participating in

  7 29 costs of outreach activities and facility rent are permitted
  7 30 as administrative costs.
  7 31    The bill may include a state mandate as defined in Code
  7 32 section 25B.3.  The bill requires that the state cost of
  7 33 any state mandate included in the bill be paid by a school
  7 34 district from state school foundation aid received by the
  7 35 school district under Code section 257.16.  The specification
  8  1 is deemed to constitute state compliance with any state mandate
  8  2 funding=related requirements of Code section 25B.2.  The
  8  3 inclusion of this specification is intended to reinstate the

  6 12    To be eligible for the preschool expansion incentive,
  6 13 a school district must develop and implement a preschool
  6 14 expansion plan, approved by the department, in order to expand
  6 15 enrollment of eligible students in the school district's
  6 16 preschool programming.  Requirements for the plan are
  6 17 provided in the bill, including how the school district will

  6 28 foundation formula or children who are served by an existing
  6 29 preschool program already receiving state or federal funds for
  6 30 the purpose of providing four=year=old preschool programming
  6 31 while the child is being served by the existing program.  The
  6 32 bill allows inclusion of children participating in an existing

  6 34 has been enhanced as part of the expansion incentive.
  6 35    The incentive program will operate for the three school

  7  9 preschool programming on October 1, 2012, October 1, 2013,
  7 10 and October 1, 2014.  The amount of incentive state aid is
  7 11 equal to 20 percent of the regular program state cost per pupil
  7 12 multiplied by the school district's incentive enrollment in the
  7 13 base year.
  7 14    The incentive state aid is required to be used to defray

  7  2 1, 2018.  For those three budget years, a school district is
  7  3 eligible to receive incentive state aid for the increase in
  7  4 the actual enrollment of eligible students in the preschool
  7  5 programming provided by a school district in the immediately
  7  6 preceding school year over the base incentive enrollment.
  7  7 The base incentive enrollment is the average of the actual
  7  8 enrollments of eligible students in the school district's
  7  9 preschool programming on October 1, 2012, October 1, 2013,
  7 10 and October 1, 2014.  The amount of incentive state aid is
  7 11 equal to 20 percent of the regular program state cost per pupil
  7 12 multiplied by the school district's incentive enrollment in the
  7 13 base year.
  7 14    The incentive state aid is required to be used to defray
  7 15 increases in costs in connection with the school district's
  7 16 preschool expansion plan.  Such costs may include renovation
  7 17 and other facility costs connected with expansion, outreach,
  7 18 one=time expenses, and other costs identified as eligible by
  7 19 the department.
  7 20    The bill also addresses administration and other costs under
  7 21 the preschool program in amendments to Code sections 256C.3 and
  7 22 256C.4. Authorization is provided for a school district to
  7 23 transport the children participating in the preschool program
  7 24 to and from activities associated with the program along with
  7 25 other children. The bill authorizes community=based providers
  7 26 to prorate the costs of transporting children participating in
  7 27 the preschool program. The allowable administrative costs for
  7 28 school districts are increased from 5 to 10 percent. Also, the
  7 29 costs of outreach activities and facility rent are permitted
  7 30 as administrative costs.
  7 31    The bill may include a state mandate as defined in Code
  7 32 section 25B.3.  The bill requires that the state cost of
  7 33 any state mandate included in the bill be paid by a school
  7 34 district from state school foundation aid received by the
  7 35 school district under Code section 257.16.  The specification
  8  1 is deemed to constitute state compliance with any state mandate
  8  2 funding=related requirements of Code section 25B.2.  The
  8  3 inclusion of this specification is intended to reinstate the
  8  4 requirement of political subdivisions to comply with any state
