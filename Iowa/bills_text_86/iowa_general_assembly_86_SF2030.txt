  1  1    Section 1.    1  1    Section 1.    1  2 agreements ==== alternative tariff rate.
  1  3    1.  An electric public utility may enter into
  1  4 interconnection agreements with customers operating distributed
  1  5 generation solar photovoltaic devices.  A utility entering
  1  6 into such an agreement may apply to the board for approval
  1  7 of an alternative tariff rate that compensates customers
  1  8 through a billing credit mechanism for the value to the
  1  9 utility, its customers, and society for operating such devices
  1 10 interconnected to the utility system and operated by customers
  1 11 primarily for meeting their own energy needs.  If approved,
  1 12 the alternative rate shall apply in lieu of the rate otherwise
  1 13 applicable to alternate energy production facilities pursuant
  1 14 to section 476.43.
  1 15    2.  An application for an alternative tariff rate submitted
  1 16 by a utility pursuant to this section shall demonstrate that
  1 17 the proposed rate conforms with the following:
  1 18    a.  Appropriately applies the methodology established by the
  1 19 board pursuant to subsection 3.
  1 20    b.  Includes a mechanism to allow recovery of the cost to
  1 21 serve customers receiving the alternative tariff rate.
  1 22    c.  Charges the customer for all electricity consumed by the
  1 23 customer at an applicable rate schedule for sales to that class
  1 24 of customer.
  1 25    d.  Credits the customer for all electricity generated by the
  1 26 solar photovoltaic device.
  1 27    e.  Applies charges and credits to a monthly billing that
  1 28 includes a provision so that the unused portion of the credit
  1 29 in any month or billing period shall be carried forward and
  1 30 credited against all charges.  In the event that the customer
  1 31 has a positive balance after the twelve=month cycle ending on
  1 32 the last day in February, that balance shall be eliminated and
  1 33 the credit cycle shall restart the following billing period
  1 34 beginning on March 1.
  1 35    3.  The board shall establish a solar value methodology
  2  1 for utilization by utilities in developing and applying for
  2  2 an alternative tariff rate pursuant to this section.  The
  2  3 methodology shall, at a minimum, account for the value of
  2  4 energy and its delivery, generation capacity, transmission
  2  5 capacity, transmission and distribution line losses, and
  2  6 environmental value.  The board may, based on known and
  2  7 measurable evidence of the cost or benefit of solar operation
  2  8 to the utility, incorporate other values into the methodology,
  2  9 including credits for locally manufactured or assembled
  2 10 energy systems, systems installed at high=value locations on
  2 11 the distribution grid, or other factors.  In developing the
  2 12 methodology pursuant to this subsection, the board may consult
  2 13 stakeholders with experience and expertise in power systems,
  2 14 solar energy, and electric utility ratemaking regarding the
  2 15 proposed methodology, underlying assumptions, and preliminary
  2 16 data.
  2 17    4.  Applications shall be subject to the approval provisions
  2 18 of section 476.6.  A utility shall recalculate the alternative
  2 19 tariff rate annually, and shall file the recalculated
  2 20 alternative rate with the board for approval.  The board shall
  2 21 not authorize a utility to charge an alternative tariff rate
  2 22 that is lower than the utility's applicable retail rate until
  2 23 three years after the board originally approved the alternative
  2 24 tariff rate.
  2 25    5.  A utility shall enter into an interconnection agreement
  2 26 with an owner of a solar photovoltaic device receiving an
  2 27 alternative tariff rate as provided in this section for a term
  2 28 of at least twenty years, unless a shorter term is agreed to by
  2 29 the parties.  The board shall develop standard interconnection
  2 30 agreement forms for utilization by the utility and the owner.
  2 31 An owner must be paid the same rate per kilowatt=hour generated
  2 32 each year for the duration of the interconnection agreement.
  2 33    6.  A utility must provide to the customer the meter and
  2 34 any other equipment needed to provide service pursuant to the
  2 35 interconnection agreement.

  3  2 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  3  3 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  3  4    This bill relates to solar interconnection agreements and
  3  5 alternative tariff rates applicable to such agreements.  The
  3  6 bill provides that a public utility entering into a solar
  3  7 energy interconnection agreement may apply to the utilities
  3  8 board within the utilities division of the department of
  3  9 commerce for approval of an alternative tariff rate that
  3 10 compensates customers through a billing credit mechanism
  3 11 for the value to the utility, its customers, and society
  3 12 for operating such devices interconnected to the utility
  3 13 system and operated by customers primarily for meeting their
  3 14 own energy needs.  The bill specifies criteria to which an
  3 15 alternative tariff rate is required to conform, and creates a
  3 16 solar value methodology for utilization by public utilities in
  3 17 developing and applying for the alternative tariff rate.  The
  3 18 bill provides that applications for an alternative rate shall
  3 19 be subject to the rate approval provisions of Code section
  3 20 476.6, and that the  utility shall enter into an interconnection
  3 21 agreement with an owner of a solar photovoltaic device
  3 22 receiving the alternative rate for a term of at least 20 years,
  3 23 unless a shorter term is agreed to by the parties.  The board is
  3 24 directed to develop standard interconnection agreement forms
  3 25 for utilization by the utility and the owner.  The bill further
  3 26 provides that the utility must provide the customer with
  3 27 the meter and any other equipment needed to provide service
  3 28 pursuant to the interconnection agreement.
