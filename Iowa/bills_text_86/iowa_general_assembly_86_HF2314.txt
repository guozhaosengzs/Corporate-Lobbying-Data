  9 17 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  9 18 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  9 19    This bill relates to the issuance and verification of, and
  9 20 the transfer of records concerning nonprofessional permits
  9 21 to carry weapons and the confidentiality of records for such
  9 22 permits and for permits to acquire pistols or revolvers, and

  9 24    POSSESSION AND VERIFICATION OF PERMIT TO CARRY WEAPONS ====
  9 25 FINE.  The bill under Code section 724.5 makes it a simple

  9 28 the person does not possess the permit to carry weapons in the
  9 29 immediate possession of the person, and fails to produce such
  9 30 permit for inspection upon the request of a peace officer.
  9 31 The bill specifies that a peace officer shall verify through
  9 32 electronic means, if possible, the validity of the person's
  9 33 permit to carry weapons. Current law provides that if a
  9 34 person commits such a violation the person commits a simple
  9 35 misdemeanor.
 10  1 DURABLE COPY OF PERMIT.  The bill requires that the
 10  2 department of public safety, in addition to the sheriff issuing
 10  3 a nonprofessional permit to carry weapons, issue a durable
 10  4 copy of the nonprofessional permit to carry weapons to the
 10  5 permit holder.  The bill provides that within 14 days after
 10  6 the sheriff has issued an initial, renewal, or duplicate
 10  7 permit to carry weapons, the sheriff shall transmit the permit
 10  8 holder's information to the department of public safety for the
 10  9 department to issue the permit holder a more durable copy of
 10 10 the permit.  The bill requires the department of public safety
 10 11 to issue the more durable copy of the permit to the permit
 10 12 holder within 30 days of the permit holder's information being
 10 13 transmitted to the department.  The bill also provides that
 10 14 the durable copy of the permit issued pursuant to the bill
 10 15 shall be considered a valid permit in addition to the permit
 10 16 issued by the sheriff. The bill specifies that the durable
 10 17 copy of the permit shall have a uniform appearance, size,
 10 18 and content prescribed and published by the commissioner of
 10 19 public safety and shall contain the name of the permit holder
 10 20 and the effective date of the permit, but shall not contain
 10 21 the permit holder's social security number or photograph and
 10 22 shall not contain information about a particular weapon or any
 10 23 ammunition.
 10 24    INTERNET HANDGUN SAFETY TRAINING COURSE.  The bill provides
 10 25 in Code section 724.9 that the handgun safety training course
 10 26 required to obtain a permit to carry under Code section 724.11
 10 27 may be conducted over the internet in a live or web=based
 10 28 format, as long as completion of the course is verified by the
 10 29 instructor or provider of the course.
 10 30    ISSUANCE OF PERMIT TO CARRY OR RENEWAL ==== TRAINING
 10 31 REQUIREMENTS.  Under current law, prior to issuing any renewal
 10 32 of a permit to carry weapons, the sheriff or commissioner under
 10 33 Code section 724.11 shall determine if the requirements of Code
 10 34 sections 724.6, 724.7, 724.8, 724.9, and 724.10 have been met.
 10 35 The bill provides for additional or alternative requirements
 11  1 under certain circumstances.
 11  2    The bill provides that beginning with the first renewal of
 11  3 a permit issued after the calendar year 2010, and alternating
 11  4 renewals thereafter, if a renewal applicant applies no later
 11  5 than 30 days after expiration of the permit, the training
 11  6 requirements of Code section 724.9(1) do not apply.
 11  7    The bill provides that beginning with the second renewal of
 11  8 a permit issued after the calendar year 2010, and alternating
 11  9 renewals thereafter, if a renewal applicant applies no
 11 10 later than 30 days after expiration of the permit, a renewal
 11 11 applicant shall qualify by taking an online training course
 11 12 certified by the national rifle association or the Iowa law
 11 13 enforcement academy, and the training program requirements of
 11 14 Code section 724.9(1) do not apply.
 11 15    If any renewal applicant applies more than 30 days after
 11 16 the expiration of the permit, the bill specifies the training
 11 17 program requirements in Code section 724.9(1) do apply to the
 11 18 applicant, and any subsequent renewal of this permit shall be
 11 19 considered a first renewal for purposes of determining the
 11 20 training requirements.
 11 21    The bill specifies that the training program requirements
 11 22 in Code section 724.9(1) do not apply to a renewal applicant
 11 23 who is able to demonstrate completion of small arms training
 11 24 (military) as specified in Code section 724.9(1)(d).  For all
 11 25 other renewal applicants who have applied more than 30 days
 11 26 after the expiration of the permit, the bill allows, in lieu of
 11 27 the training program requirements in Code section 724.9(1), the
 11 28 renewal applicant to choose to qualify on a firing range under
 11 29 the supervision of an instructor certified by the national
 11 30 rifle association or the department of public safety or another
 11 31 state's department of public safety, state police department,
 11 32 or similar certifying body.
 11 33    As an alternative, a renewal applicant, under the bill, may
 11 34 choose to qualify at any renewal, under the training program
 11 35 requirements in Code section 724.9(1), or the renewal applicant
 12  1 may choose to qualify on a firing range under the supervision
 12  2 of an instructor certified by the national rifle association
 12  3 or the department of public safety or another state's
 12  4 department of public safety, state police department, or
 12  5 similar certifying body. Such training or qualification must
 12  6 occur within the 24=month period prior to the expiration of
 12  7 the applicant's current permit, except that the 24=month time
 12  8 period limitation to complete the training or qualification
 12  9 does not apply to an applicant who is able to demonstrate
 12 10 completion of small arms training (military) as specified in
 12 11 Code section 724.9(1)(d).
 12 12    RENEWAL FEE.  The bill does not increase or decrease the
 12 13 fee for a renewal of a permit to carry weapons but does allow
 12 14 a renewal applicant to pay the $25 renewal application fee if
 12 15 the renewal applicant applies no later than 30 days after such
 12 16 expiration.  Current law requires that in order to be assessed
 12 17 the $25 renewal application fee, the renewal applicant must
 12 18 apply at least 30 days prior to the expiration of the permit to
 12 19 carry weapons.
 12 20    TRANSFER OF REGULATION OF PERMIT.  The bill specifies that
 12 21 the department of public safety shall by rule specify the
 12 22 procedure to transfer the regulation of a nonprofessional
 12 23 permit holder's permit to another sheriff for the purposes of
 12 24 issuing a renewal or duplicate permit, or complying with Code
 12 25 section 724.13 relating to permit suspensions and revocations
 12 26 and criminal history background checks, if the permit holder
 12 27 has changed residences from one county to another county since
 12 28 the issuance of the permit.
 12 29    CONFIDENTIALITY.  The bill provides in Code section
 12 30 724.23 that, notwithstanding any other law or rule to the
 12 31 contrary, the commissioner of public safety and any issuing
 12 32 officer (county sheriff) shall keep confidential personally
 12 33 identifiable information of applicants and holders of
 12 34 nonprofessional permits to carry weapons and permits to
 12 35 acquire pistols or revolvers. The release of any confidential
 13  1 information, except as otherwise provided in the bill, requires
 13  2 a court order or the consent of the person whose personally
 13  3 identifiable information is the subject of the information
 13  4 request.
 13  5    EXCEPTIONS TO CONFIDENTIALITY == RELEASE OF PERMIT

 13  7 information relating to the issuance, denial, revocation, or
 13  8 administration of nonprofessional permits to carry weapons and

 13 11 permit holder, the release of information to a law enforcement
 13 12 agency investigating a violation of law where probable cause
 13 13 exists, the release for purposes of conducting a background
 13 14 check, or the release of information relating to the validity
 13 15 of a professional permit to carry weapons to an employer who
 13 16 requires an employee or an agent of the employer to possess a
 13 17 professional permit to carry weapons as part of the duties of
 13 18 the employee or agent.
 13 19    The bill also permits the release of confidential
 13 20 information to a member of the public, if the person in writing
 13 21 or in person, requests whether another person possesses a
 13 22 professional or nonprofessional permit to carry weapons or a
 13 23 permit to acquire pistols or revolvers.
 13 24    However, information regarding a person in whose favor
 13 25 either a no=contact order or protective order has been issued
 13 26 and is still in effect, shall not be released, if the person
 13 27 presents the order to the department of public safety or
 13 28 issuing officer.
 13 29    Prior to the release of the information under the bill,
 13 30 the member of the public requesting the information must
 13 31 provide the department of public safety or issuing officer
 13 32 with the member's name in writing and on a form prescribed by
 13 33 the department of public safety even if the person appears in
 13 34 person to request such information.  The bill requires the
 13 35 request to include the name of the other person and one of
 14  1 the following personal identifiers: the date of birth of the
 14  2 person, the address of the person, or the telephone number of
 14  3 the person.  The bill requires the department of public safety
 14  4 or issuing officer to keep a record of the person making the
 14  5 request.
 14  6    However, if a person in whose favor either a no=contact
 14  7 order or protective order has been issued and is still in
 14  8 effect, presents the order to the department of public safety
 14  9 or the issuing officer and requests whether another person
 14 10 who is the subject of the order possesses a professional or
 14 11 nonprofessional permit to carry weapons or a permit to acquire
 14 12 pistols or revolvers, the department shall not keep a record
 14 13 of the person making the request or disclose the name of the
 14 14 person making the request.
 14 15    The bill provides that the information released by
 14 16 the department of public safety shall be limited to an
 14 17 acknowledgment as to whether the person possesses a
 14 18 professional or nonprofessional permit to carry weapons or a
 14 19 permit to acquire pistols or revolvers, the date such a permit
 14 20 was issued, and whether the person has ever possessed such a
 14 21 permit that has ever been revoked or has expired and the date
 14 22 the permit was revoked or expired.
 14 23    The bill specifies that the release of any other
 14 24 confidential information shall require a court order or the
 14 25 consent of the person whose personally identifiable information
 14 26 is subject to the request.
 14 27    FEE FOR RELEASE OF PERMIT INFORMATION.  The bill provides
 14 28 that the department of public safety shall, by rule, establish
 14 29 a reasonable fee to cover the costs of complying with release
 14 30 of permit information requests.

 15  1 carry weapons and permits to acquire pistols or revolvers on or
 15  2 after the effective date of this portion of the bill.
 15  3    FRAUDULENT TRANSFER OF FIREARMS OR AMMUNITION.  The
 15  4 bill creates a new Code section to provide that a person
 15  5 who knowingly solicits, persuades, encourages, or entices
 15  6 a licensed firearms dealer or private seller of firearms
 15  7 or ammunition to transfer a firearm or ammunition under
 15  8 circumstances that the person knows would violate the laws
 15  9 of this state or of the United States commits a class "D"
 15 10 felony.  A person who knowingly provides materially false
 15 11 information to a licensed firearms dealer or private seller of
 15 12 firearms or ammunition with the intent to deceive the firearms
 15 13 dealer or seller about the legality of a transfer of a firearm
 15 14 or ammunition commits a class "D" felony.  Any person who
 15 15 willfully procures another to engage in conduct prohibited by
 15 16 this new Code section shall be held accountable as a principal.
 15 17    The new Code section does not apply to a law enforcement
 15 18 officer acting in the officer's official capacity or to a
 15 19 person acting at the direction of such law enforcement officer.

 11  6 requirements of Code section 724.9(1) do not apply.
 11  7    The bill provides that beginning with the second renewal of
 11  8 a permit issued after the calendar year 2010, and alternating
 11  9 renewals thereafter, if a renewal applicant applies no
 11 10 later than 30 days after expiration of the permit, a renewal

 11 27 the training program requirements in Code section 724.9(1), the
 11 28 renewal applicant to choose to qualify on a firing range under
 11 29 the supervision of an instructor certified by the national
 11 30 rifle association or the department of public safety or another
 11 31 state's department of public safety, state police department,

 11 33    As an alternative, a renewal applicant, under the bill, may
 11 34 choose to qualify at any renewal, under the training program
 11 35 requirements in Code section 724.9(1), or the renewal applicant
 12  1 may choose to qualify on a firing range under the supervision
 12  2 of an instructor certified by the national rifle association
 12  3 or the department of public safety or another state's
 12  4 department of public safety, state police department, or
 12  5 similar certifying body. Such training or qualification must
 12  6 occur within the 24=month period prior to the expiration of
 12  7 the applicant's current permit, except that the 24=month time
 12  8 period limitation to complete the training or qualification
 12  9 does not apply to an applicant who is able to demonstrate
 12 10 completion of small arms training (military) as specified in
 12 11 Code section 724.9(1)(d).
 12 12    RENEWAL FEE.  The bill does not increase or decrease the

 12 24 issuing a renewal or duplicate permit, or complying with Code
 12 25 section 724.13 relating to permit suspensions and revocations
 12 26 and criminal history background checks, if the permit holder
 12 27 has changed residences from one county to another county since

 15  9 of this state or of the United States commits a class "D"

 15 11 information to a licensed firearms dealer or private seller of
 15 12 firearms or ammunition with the intent to deceive the firearms
 15 13 dealer or seller about the legality of a transfer of a firearm

 11  7    The bill provides that beginning with the second renewal of

 12  7 the applicant's current permit, except that the 24=month time
 12  8 period limitation to complete the training or qualification

 12  9 does not apply to an applicant who is able to demonstrate
 12 10 completion of small arms training (military) as specified in
 12 11 Code section 724.9(1)(d).
 12 12    RENEWAL FEE.  The bill does not increase or decrease the

 13 27 presents the order to the department of public safety or
 13 28 issuing officer.
 13 29    Prior to the release of the information under the bill,
 13 30 the member of the public requesting the information must
 13 31 provide the department of public safety or issuing officer
 13 32 with the member's name in writing and on a form prescribed by

 15  9 of this state or of the United States commits a class "D"

 12  5 similar certifying body. Such training or qualification must
 12  6 occur within the 24=month period prior to the expiration of
 12  7 the applicant's current permit, except that the 24=month time
 12  8 period limitation to complete the training or qualification

 11  2    The bill provides that beginning with the first renewal of
 11  3 a permit issued after the calendar year 2010, and alternating

 11  6 requirements of Code section 724.9(1) do not apply.
 11  7    The bill provides that beginning with the second renewal of
 11  8 a permit issued after the calendar year 2010, and alternating

 11 12 certified by the national rifle association or the Iowa law
 11 13 enforcement academy, and the training program requirements of

 12  5 similar certifying body. Such training or qualification must
 12  6 occur within the 24=month period prior to the expiration of
 12  7 the applicant's current permit, except that the 24=month time
 12  8 period limitation to complete the training or qualification

 12 33 identifiable information of applicants and holders of
 12 34 nonprofessional permits to carry weapons and permits to
 12 35 acquire pistols or revolvers. The release of any confidential
 13  1 information, except as otherwise provided in the bill, requires
 13  2 a court order or the consent of the person whose personally
 13  3 identifiable information is the subject of the information
 13  4 request.

 13 22 professional or nonprofessional permit to carry weapons or a
 13 23 permit to acquire pistols or revolvers.

 13 28 issuing officer.
 13 29    Prior to the release of the information under the bill,
 13 30 the member of the public requesting the information must
 13 31 provide the department of public safety or issuing officer
 13 32 with the member's name in writing and on a form prescribed by
 13 33 the department of public safety even if the person appears in
 13 34 person to request such information.  The bill requires the

 14  4 or issuing officer to keep a record of the person making the
 14  5 request.
 14  6    However, if a person in whose favor either a no=contact
 14  7 order or protective order has been issued and is still in
 14  8 effect, presents the order to the department of public safety
 14  9 or the issuing officer and requests whether another person
 14 10 who is the subject of the order possesses a professional or

 14 12 pistols or revolvers, the department shall not keep a record
 14 13 of the person making the request or disclose the name of the
 14 14 person making the request.
 14 15    The bill provides that the information released by
 14 16 the department of public safety shall be limited to an

 14 20 was issued, and whether the person has ever possessed such a
 14 21 permit that has ever been revoked or has expired and the date
 14 22 the permit was revoked or expired.
 14 23    The bill specifies that the release of any other
 14 24 confidential information shall require a court order or the

 15  9 of this state or of the United States commits a class "D"

 13 27 presents the order to the department of public safety or
 13 28 issuing officer.
 13 29    Prior to the release of the information under the bill,
 13 30 the member of the public requesting the information must
 13 31 provide the department of public safety or issuing officer
 13 32 with the member's name in writing and on a form prescribed by

 15  8 circumstances that the person knows would violate the laws
 15  9 of this state or of the United States commits a class "D"

 15 12 firearms or ammunition with the intent to deceive the firearms
 15 13 dealer or seller about the legality of a transfer of a firearm
 15 14 or ammunition commits a class "D" felony.  Any person who
 15 15 willfully procures another to engage in conduct prohibited by

 11 17 program requirements in Code section 724.9(1) do apply to the
 11 18 applicant, and any subsequent renewal of this permit shall be
 11 19 considered a first renewal for purposes of determining the

 14  8 effect, presents the order to the department of public safety
 14  9 or the issuing officer and requests whether another person
 14 10 who is the subject of the order possesses a professional or

 14 12 pistols or revolvers, the department shall not keep a record
 14 13 of the person making the request or disclose the name of the

 11  2    The bill provides that beginning with the first renewal of
 11  3 a permit issued after the calendar year 2010, and alternating

 11  7    The bill provides that beginning with the second renewal of
 11  8 a permit issued after the calendar year 2010, and alternating

 11 11 applicant shall qualify by taking an online training course
 11 12 certified by the national rifle association or the Iowa law
 11 13 enforcement academy, and the training program requirements of
 11 14 Code section 724.9(1) do not apply.
 11 15    If any renewal applicant applies more than 30 days after
 11 16 the expiration of the permit, the bill specifies the training
 11 17 program requirements in Code section 724.9(1) do apply to the
 11 18 applicant, and any subsequent renewal of this permit shall be
 11 19 considered a first renewal for purposes of determining the
 11 20 training requirements.
 11 21    The bill specifies that the training program requirements
 11 22 in Code section 724.9(1) do not apply to a renewal applicant
 11 23 who is able to demonstrate completion of small arms training

 11 33    As an alternative, a renewal applicant, under the bill, may
 11 34 choose to qualify at any renewal, under the training program
 11 35 requirements in Code section 724.9(1), or the renewal applicant
 12  1 may choose to qualify on a firing range under the supervision
 12  2 of an instructor certified by the national rifle association
 12  3 or the department of public safety or another state's
 12  4 department of public safety, state police department, or
 12  5 similar certifying body. Such training or qualification must
 12  6 occur within the 24=month period prior to the expiration of
 12  7 the applicant's current permit, except that the 24=month time
 12  8 period limitation to complete the training or qualification
 12  9 does not apply to an applicant who is able to demonstrate
 12 10 completion of small arms training (military) as specified in
 12 11 Code section 724.9(1)(d).
 12 12    RENEWAL FEE.  The bill does not increase or decrease the
 12 13 fee for a renewal of a permit to carry weapons but does allow
 12 14 a renewal applicant to pay the $25 renewal application fee if
 12 15 the renewal applicant applies no later than 30 days after such
 12 16 expiration.  Current law requires that in order to be assessed
 12 17 the $25 renewal application fee, the renewal applicant must

 12 19 carry weapons.

 12 32 officer (county sheriff) shall keep confidential personally
 12 33 identifiable information of applicants and holders of
 12 34 nonprofessional permits to carry weapons and permits to
 12 35 acquire pistols or revolvers. The release of any confidential
 13  1 information, except as otherwise provided in the bill, requires
 13  2 a court order or the consent of the person whose personally
 13  3 identifiable information is the subject of the information
 13  4 request.
 13  5    EXCEPTIONS TO CONFIDENTIALITY == RELEASE OF PERMIT

 14 20 was issued, and whether the person has ever possessed such a
 14 21 permit that has ever been revoked or has expired and the date
 14 22 the permit was revoked or expired.
 14 23    The bill specifies that the release of any other

 11 15    If any renewal applicant applies more than 30 days after
 11 16 the expiration of the permit, the bill specifies the training
 11 17 program requirements in Code section 724.9(1) do apply to the
 11 18 applicant, and any subsequent renewal of this permit shall be
 11 19 considered a first renewal for purposes of determining the

 11 23 who is able to demonstrate completion of small arms training
 11 24 (military) as specified in Code section 724.9(1)(d).  For all
 11 25 other renewal applicants who have applied more than 30 days
 11 26 after the expiration of the permit, the bill allows, in lieu of
 11 27 the training program requirements in Code section 724.9(1), the

 11 31 state's department of public safety, state police department,
 11 32 or similar certifying body.
 11 33    As an alternative, a renewal applicant, under the bill, may
 11 34 choose to qualify at any renewal, under the training program
 11 35 requirements in Code section 724.9(1), or the renewal applicant
 12  1 may choose to qualify on a firing range under the supervision
 12  2 of an instructor certified by the national rifle association
 12  3 or the department of public safety or another state's
 12  4 department of public safety, state police department, or
 12  5 similar certifying body. Such training or qualification must
 12  6 occur within the 24=month period prior to the expiration of
 12  7 the applicant's current permit, except that the 24=month time
 12  8 period limitation to complete the training or qualification
 12  9 does not apply to an applicant who is able to demonstrate
 12 10 completion of small arms training (military) as specified in
 12 11 Code section 724.9(1)(d).
 12 12    RENEWAL FEE.  The bill does not increase or decrease the

 12 14 a renewal applicant to pay the $25 renewal application fee if
 12 15 the renewal applicant applies no later than 30 days after such
 12 16 expiration.  Current law requires that in order to be assessed
 12 17 the $25 renewal application fee, the renewal applicant must

 12 19 carry weapons.

 12 26 and criminal history background checks, if the permit holder
 12 27 has changed residences from one county to another county since

 12 30 724.23 that, notwithstanding any other law or rule to the
 12 31 contrary, the commissioner of public safety and any issuing
 12 32 officer (county sheriff) shall keep confidential personally
 12 33 identifiable information of applicants and holders of
 12 34 nonprofessional permits to carry weapons and permits to
 12 35 acquire pistols or revolvers. The release of any confidential
 13  1 information, except as otherwise provided in the bill, requires
 13  2 a court order or the consent of the person whose personally
 13  3 identifiable information is the subject of the information
 13  4 request.

 13 21 or in person, requests whether another person possesses a
 13 22 professional or nonprofessional permit to carry weapons or a
 13 23 permit to acquire pistols or revolvers.
 13 24    However, information regarding a person in whose favor
 13 25 either a no=contact order or protective order has been issued
 13 26 and is still in effect, shall not be released, if the person
 13 27 presents the order to the department of public safety or
 13 28 issuing officer.
 13 29    Prior to the release of the information under the bill,
 13 30 the member of the public requesting the information must
 13 31 provide the department of public safety or issuing officer
 13 32 with the member's name in writing and on a form prescribed by
 13 33 the department of public safety even if the person appears in
 13 34 person to request such information.  The bill requires the
 13 35 request to include the name of the other person and one of
 14  1 the following personal identifiers: the date of birth of the

 14  4 or issuing officer to keep a record of the person making the
 14  5 request.
 14  6    However, if a person in whose favor either a no=contact
 14  7 order or protective order has been issued and is still in
 14  8 effect, presents the order to the department of public safety
 14  9 or the issuing officer and requests whether another person

 14 13 of the person making the request or disclose the name of the
 14 14 person making the request.

 14 20 was issued, and whether the person has ever possessed such a
 14 21 permit that has ever been revoked or has expired and the date
 14 22 the permit was revoked or expired.
 14 23    The bill specifies that the release of any other
 14 24 confidential information shall require a court order or the
 14 25 consent of the person whose personally identifiable information
 14 26 is subject to the request.
 14 27    FEE FOR RELEASE OF PERMIT INFORMATION.  The bill provides

 15  7 or ammunition to transfer a firearm or ammunition under
 15  8 circumstances that the person knows would violate the laws
 15  9 of this state or of the United States commits a class "D"
 15 10 felony.  A person who knowingly provides materially false
 15 11 information to a licensed firearms dealer or private seller of
 15 12 firearms or ammunition with the intent to deceive the firearms
 15 13 dealer or seller about the legality of a transfer of a firearm
 15 14 or ammunition commits a class "D" felony.  Any person who
 15 15 willfully procures another to engage in conduct prohibited by
 15 16 this new Code section shall be held accountable as a principal.
 15 17    The new Code section does not apply to a law enforcement
 15 18 officer acting in the officer's official capacity or to a
 15 19 person acting at the direction of such law enforcement officer.

 11  7    The bill provides that beginning with the second renewal of
 11  8 a permit issued after the calendar year 2010, and alternating
