  8 12 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  8 13 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  8 14    GENERAL.  This bill amends provisions relating to the
  8 15 governance of a drainage or levee district (district) governed
  8 16 by a drainage district board.
  8 17    MERGER.  The bill amends requirements for providing notice
  8 18 to persons affected by a proposed merger of two or more
  8 19 districts, and persons affected by a proposed annexation of
  8 20 land as part of such merger.  The bill eliminates a requirement
  8 21 that the notice be delivered by ordinary mail and publication
  8 22 to specified affected persons who have an interest in a
  8 23 district participating in the merger and, if required, to the
  8 24 owners of land that may be annexed (Code section 468.265).
  8 25 That process is replaced by a requirement that landowners
  8 26 receive notice under the same requirements that apply when a
  8 27 district is established, including by publication, certified
  8 28 mail, or personal service (Code sections 468.14 through
  8 29 468.18).  If the proposed merger includes the annexation of
  8 30 land, notice must be provided to landowners by ordinary mail.
  8 31    THRESHOLD AMOUNTS == BIDDING PROCEDURES.  The bill amends
  8 32 provisions governing when a board must let out a project
  8 33 (either for a repair or improvement for bid and conduct a
  8 34 hearing regarding the project).  The bill eliminates a number
  8 35 of provisions that require the same procedures as used under
  9  1 the "Iowa Construction Bidding Procedures Act" (Code chapter

  9 10 landowners of the district and a hearing on the matter if the
  9 11 estimated cost of the project exceeds $50,000.  The notice must
  9 12 be by publication (Code section 468.15), unless the estimated
  9 13 cost of the project exceeds the competitive bid threshold in
  9 14 which case notice is required in the same manner as when a
  9 15 district is established, including by publication, certified
  9 16 mail, or personal service (Code sections 468.14 through

  9 18 or of eradicating brush or weeds along open ditches, the board
  9 19 may use moneys credited to the county's secondary road fund or
  9 20 weed fund, so long as the project does not exceed the adjusted

  9 26 a vacancy the board may appoint any individual to serve as a

  9 28 the district is located and are eligible to vote in the general

  9 30    BACKGROUND.  A district is established by a county board
  9 31 of supervisors which manages the district (Iowa Code section

  9 33 joint board of supervisors if the district crosses county lines

  9 35 may relinquish control of a district to a board of elected
 10  1 trustees (Iowa Code chapter 468, subchapter III).  The two
 10  2 basic types of drainage projects are repairs and improvements.

  9  5 the bill requires that letting out bids is required when the
  9  6 estimated cost of a project exceeds the "adjusted competitive
  9  7 bid threshold" for vertical infrastructure applicable to
  9  8 counties established by the state department of transportation
  9  9 (Code section 314.1B).  The bill also requires a notice to
  9 10 landowners of the district and a hearing on the matter if the
  9 11 estimated cost of the project exceeds $50,000.  The notice must
  9 12 be by publication (Code section 468.15), unless the estimated
  9 13 cost of the project exceeds the competitive bid threshold in
  9 14 which case notice is required in the same manner as when a
  9 15 district is established, including by publication, certified
  9 16 mail, or personal service (Code sections 468.14 through
  9 17 468.18).  The bill also provides that in the case of a repair
  9 18 or of eradicating brush or weeds along open ditches, the board
  9 19 may use moneys credited to the county's secondary road fund or
  9 20 weed fund, so long as the project does not exceed the adjusted

  9 30    BACKGROUND.  A district is established by a county board
  9 31 of supervisors which manages the district (Iowa Code section
  9 32 468.1). A district may also be established and managed by a
  9 33 joint board of supervisors if the district crosses county lines
  9 34 (Iowa Code chapter 468, subchapter II).  A board of supervisors
  9 35 may relinquish control of a district to a board of elected
 10  1 trustees (Iowa Code chapter 468, subchapter III).  The two
 10  2 basic types of drainage projects are repairs and improvements.
 10  3 Generally, a repair is work which is necessary to restore the
 10  4 facility to its original design or intended efficiency while
 10  5 an improvement is  an improvement that enhances or enlarges the
 10  6 district's capacity or efficiency.

  9 10 landowners of the district and a hearing on the matter if the
  9 11 estimated cost of the project exceeds $50,000.  The notice must
  9 12 be by publication (Code section 468.15), unless the estimated
  9 13 cost of the project exceeds the competitive bid threshold in
  9 14 which case notice is required in the same manner as when a
  9 15 district is established, including by publication, certified
  9 16 mail, or personal service (Code sections 468.14 through

  9 18 or of eradicating brush or weeds along open ditches, the board
  9 19 may use moneys credited to the county's secondary road fund or
  9 20 weed fund, so long as the project does not exceed the adjusted

  9  9 (Code section 314.1B).  The bill also requires a notice to

  9 12 be by publication (Code section 468.15), unless the estimated
