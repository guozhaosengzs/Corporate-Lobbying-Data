 13 19                          APPLICABILITY
 13 20    Sec. 24.  APPLICABILITY.  This Act applies to elections held
 13 21 on or after January 1, 2017.
 13 22                           EXPLANATION
 13 23 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
 13 24 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
 13 25    This bill requires that a person provide certain proof of
 13 26 identification at the time that the person votes, modifies
 13 27 proof of identification and proof of residence requirements
 13 28 for election day and in=person absentee registration, modifies
 13 29 absentee voting procedures for eligible voters in assisted
 13 30 living programs, and creates a criminal offense for falsely
 13 31 swearing certain oaths and affidavits.
 13 32    Division I of the bill relates to voter identification
 13 33 requirements. The bill maintains current law allowing a person
 13 34 wishing to register to vote on election day, or in person when
 13 35 voting an absentee ballot, to establish proof of identity
 14  1 and proof of residence by written oath of a person who is
 14  2 registered to vote in the precinct, but requires that the oath
 14  3 of the person wishing to vote and the registered voter's oath
 14  4 be executed on the same piece of paper.
 14  5    The bill requires that a voter provide proof of
 14  6 identification to a precinct election official before being
 14  7 allowed to vote, and also requires that a person wishing to
 14  8 vote by absentee ballot at a county commissioner of elections
 14  9 office or at a satellite absentee voting station present
 14 10 the same proof of identification. The bill requires that
 14 11 acceptable proof of identification show the name of the
 14 12 individual voter, include a photograph of the voter, and be
 14 13 issued by the government of the United States, the state of
 14 14 Iowa, an Iowa public or private university or college, an Iowa
 14 15 secondary school, or a political subdivision of the state.
 14 16    The bill provides that, in lieu of providing identification
 14 17 in order to vote, a person may establish proof of
 14 18 identification by written oath of the person wishing to vote
 14 19 and of a person who provides their own proof of identification
 14 20 and who attests to the voter's identity. The bill provides
 14 21 that the oath shall be in the form prescribed by the state
 14 22 commissioner of elections, and that the oath shall state the
 14 23 identity of the person wishing to vote and shall attest to
 14 24 the stated identity of the person wishing to vote. The bill
 14 25 requires that the oath be signed by both the attesting person
 14 26 and the person wishing to vote. The bill makes it a class "D"
 14 27 felony to falsely swear to or affirm an oath pursuant to this
 14 28 provision or to falsely attest to a voter's identity. The bill
 14 29 requires that the oath advise both persons that falsely stating
 14 30 or attesting to a voter's identity is a class "D" felony. A
 14 31 class "D" felony is punishable by confinement for no more than
 14 32 five years and a fine of at least $750 but not more than $7,500.
 14 33 The bill provides that an attesting person is prohibited from
 14 34 signing any additional such oaths for the same election.
 14 35    The bill provides that if proof of identification is
 15  1 established the person shall then be allowed to vote. If a
 15  2 person is unable or refuses to present proof of identification,
 15  3 or if the precinct election official determines that the
 15  4 proof of identification does not meet specified requirements,
 15  5 the person shall be offered the option to vote a provisional
 15  6 ballot. If a person is casting a provisional ballot
 15  7 under these circumstances, the person shall receive a
 15  8 printed statement giving notice of the types of acceptable
 15  9 identification and notice that the person is required to show
 15 10 acceptable identification before the provisional ballot can
 15 11 be counted. However, the bill provides that a voter casting
 15 12 a provisional ballot for this reason may execute an affidavit
 15 13 in the form prescribed by the state commissioner of elections,
 15 14 affirming that the voter is the person the voter claims to be
 15 15 and affirming that the voter is either indigent and unable to
 15 16 obtain proof of identification without the payment of a fee or
 15 17 that the voter has a religious objection to being photographed.
 15 18    The bill makes it a class "D" felony to falsify an affidavit
 15 19 that attests to identity. A class "D" felony is punishable by
 15 20 confinement for no more than five years and a fine of at least
 15 21 $750 but not more than $7,500. The bill also provides that
 15 22 any provisional ballot cast accompanied by such an affidavit
 15 23 shall be presumed valid unless additional written statements
 15 24 or documents are delivered to the county commissioner of
 15 25 elections office prior to the date that provisional ballots
 15 26 are considered and the precinct election board determines that
 15 27 such additional evidence successfully rebuts the presumption
 15 28 of validity.
 15 29    The bill also makes changes to the election notice to be
 15 30 published by the county commissioner of elections to require
 15 31 that election notices include a statement that all voters will
 15 32 be required to show proof of identification before casting a
 15 33 ballot.
 15 34    The bill requires that persons residing in a hospital or
 15 35 health care facility who apply to vote by absentee ballot shall
 16  1 present proof of identification. If the applicant is unable to
 16  2 present proof of identification, the applicant shall be able
 16  3 to execute an affidavit in the form prescribed by the state
 16  4 commissioner of elections, stating that the applicant does not
 16  5 have and is unable to obtain proof of identification and that
 16  6 the applicant resides in a hospital or health care facility.
 16  7 If the applicant refuses to execute such an affidavit and is
 16  8 unable to present proof of identification, the voter is allowed
 16  9 to cast a provisional ballot. The bill further extends all
 16 10 provisions applying to balloting by residents of a health
 16 11 care facility and hospital patients to include tenants of an
 16 12 assisted living program.
 16 13    The bill also provides that a person obtaining a
 16 14 nonoperator's identification card for the purpose of voting
 16 15 shall not be charged for the issuance of the nonoperator's
 16 16 identification card. The bill requires that nonoperator's
 16 17 identification cards issued to serve as proof of identification
 16 18 for voting be labeled by the department as "For Voting Purposes
 16 19 Only".
 16 20    Division II of the bill makes conforming changes to certain
 16 21 required notices on forms related to voter registration and
 16 22 registration by mail.
 16 23    Division III of the bill provides that the bill applies to

 13 22                           EXPLANATION
 13 23 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
 13 24 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
 13 25    This bill requires that a person provide certain proof of
 13 26 identification at the time that the person votes, modifies
 13 27 proof of identification and proof of residence requirements
 13 28 for election day and in=person absentee registration, modifies
 13 29 absentee voting procedures for eligible voters in assisted
 13 30 living programs, and creates a criminal offense for falsely
 13 31 swearing certain oaths and affidavits.
 13 32    Division I of the bill relates to voter identification
 13 33 requirements. The bill maintains current law allowing a person
 13 34 wishing to register to vote on election day, or in person when
 13 35 voting an absentee ballot, to establish proof of identity
 14  1 and proof of residence by written oath of a person who is
 14  2 registered to vote in the precinct, but requires that the oath
 14  3 of the person wishing to vote and the registered voter's oath
 14  4 be executed on the same piece of paper.
 14  5    The bill requires that a voter provide proof of
 14  6 identification to a precinct election official before being
 14  7 allowed to vote, and also requires that a person wishing to
 14  8 vote by absentee ballot at a county commissioner of elections
 14  9 office or at a satellite absentee voting station present
 14 10 the same proof of identification. The bill requires that
 14 11 acceptable proof of identification show the name of the
 14 12 individual voter, include a photograph of the voter, and be
 14 13 issued by the government of the United States, the state of
 14 14 Iowa, an Iowa public or private university or college, an Iowa
 14 15 secondary school, or a political subdivision of the state.
 14 16    The bill provides that, in lieu of providing identification
 14 17 in order to vote, a person may establish proof of
 14 18 identification by written oath of the person wishing to vote
 14 19 and of a person who provides their own proof of identification
 14 20 and who attests to the voter's identity. The bill provides
 14 21 that the oath shall be in the form prescribed by the state
 14 22 commissioner of elections, and that the oath shall state the
 14 23 identity of the person wishing to vote and shall attest to
 14 24 the stated identity of the person wishing to vote. The bill
 14 25 requires that the oath be signed by both the attesting person
 14 26 and the person wishing to vote. The bill makes it a class "D"
 14 27 felony to falsely swear to or affirm an oath pursuant to this
 14 28 provision or to falsely attest to a voter's identity. The bill
 14 29 requires that the oath advise both persons that falsely stating
 14 30 or attesting to a voter's identity is a class "D" felony. A
 14 31 class "D" felony is punishable by confinement for no more than
 14 32 five years and a fine of at least $750 but not more than $7,500.
 14 33 The bill provides that an attesting person is prohibited from
 14 34 signing any additional such oaths for the same election.
 14 35    The bill provides that if proof of identification is
 15  1 established the person shall then be allowed to vote. If a
 15  2 person is unable or refuses to present proof of identification,
 15  3 or if the precinct election official determines that the
 15  4 proof of identification does not meet specified requirements,
 15  5 the person shall be offered the option to vote a provisional
 15  6 ballot. If a person is casting a provisional ballot
 15  7 under these circumstances, the person shall receive a
 15  8 printed statement giving notice of the types of acceptable
 15  9 identification and notice that the person is required to show
 15 10 acceptable identification before the provisional ballot can
 15 11 be counted. However, the bill provides that a voter casting
 15 12 a provisional ballot for this reason may execute an affidavit
 15 13 in the form prescribed by the state commissioner of elections,
 15 14 affirming that the voter is the person the voter claims to be
 15 15 and affirming that the voter is either indigent and unable to
 15 16 obtain proof of identification without the payment of a fee or
 15 17 that the voter has a religious objection to being photographed.
 15 18    The bill makes it a class "D" felony to falsify an affidavit
 15 19 that attests to identity. A class "D" felony is punishable by
 15 20 confinement for no more than five years and a fine of at least
 15 21 $750 but not more than $7,500. The bill also provides that
 15 22 any provisional ballot cast accompanied by such an affidavit
 15 23 shall be presumed valid unless additional written statements
 15 24 or documents are delivered to the county commissioner of
 15 25 elections office prior to the date that provisional ballots
 15 26 are considered and the precinct election board determines that
 15 27 such additional evidence successfully rebuts the presumption
 15 28 of validity.
 15 29    The bill also makes changes to the election notice to be
 15 30 published by the county commissioner of elections to require
 15 31 that election notices include a statement that all voters will
 15 32 be required to show proof of identification before casting a
 15 33 ballot.
 15 34    The bill requires that persons residing in a hospital or
 15 35 health care facility who apply to vote by absentee ballot shall
 16  1 present proof of identification. If the applicant is unable to
 16  2 present proof of identification, the applicant shall be able
 16  3 to execute an affidavit in the form prescribed by the state
 16  4 commissioner of elections, stating that the applicant does not
 16  5 have and is unable to obtain proof of identification and that
 16  6 the applicant resides in a hospital or health care facility.
 16  7 If the applicant refuses to execute such an affidavit and is
 16  8 unable to present proof of identification, the voter is allowed
 16  9 to cast a provisional ballot. The bill further extends all
 16 10 provisions applying to balloting by residents of a health
 16 11 care facility and hospital patients to include tenants of an
 16 12 assisted living program.
 16 13    The bill also provides that a person obtaining a

 14  3 of the person wishing to vote and the registered voter's oath
 14  4 be executed on the same piece of paper.
 14  5    The bill requires that a voter provide proof of
 14  6 identification to a precinct election official before being
 14  7 allowed to vote, and also requires that a person wishing to
 14  8 vote by absentee ballot at a county commissioner of elections
 14  9 office or at a satellite absentee voting station present
 14 10 the same proof of identification. The bill requires that

 14 12 individual voter, include a photograph of the voter, and be
 14 13 issued by the government of the United States, the state of

 14 24 the stated identity of the person wishing to vote. The bill
 14 25 requires that the oath be signed by both the attesting person
 14 26 and the person wishing to vote. The bill makes it a class "D"
 14 27 felony to falsely swear to or affirm an oath pursuant to this
 14 28 provision or to falsely attest to a voter's identity. The bill
 14 29 requires that the oath advise both persons that falsely stating

 15 17 that the voter has a religious objection to being photographed.
 15 18    The bill makes it a class "D" felony to falsify an affidavit

 13 25    This bill requires that a person provide certain proof of
 13 26 identification at the time that the person votes, modifies
 13 27 proof of identification and proof of residence requirements
 13 28 for election day and in=person absentee registration, modifies
 13 29 absentee voting procedures for eligible voters in assisted
 13 30 living programs, and creates a criminal offense for falsely
 13 31 swearing certain oaths and affidavits.
 13 32    Division I of the bill relates to voter identification
 13 33 requirements. The bill maintains current law allowing a person
 13 34 wishing to register to vote on election day, or in person when
 13 35 voting an absentee ballot, to establish proof of identity
 14  1 and proof of residence by written oath of a person who is
 14  2 registered to vote in the precinct, but requires that the oath
 14  3 of the person wishing to vote and the registered voter's oath
 14  4 be executed on the same piece of paper.
 14  5    The bill requires that a voter provide proof of
 14  6 identification to a precinct election official before being
 14  7 allowed to vote, and also requires that a person wishing to
 14  8 vote by absentee ballot at a county commissioner of elections
 14  9 office or at a satellite absentee voting station present
 14 10 the same proof of identification. The bill requires that
 14 11 acceptable proof of identification show the name of the
 14 12 individual voter, include a photograph of the voter, and be
 14 13 issued by the government of the United States, the state of
 14 14 Iowa, an Iowa public or private university or college, an Iowa
 14 15 secondary school, or a political subdivision of the state.
 14 16    The bill provides that, in lieu of providing identification
 14 17 in order to vote, a person may establish proof of
 14 18 identification by written oath of the person wishing to vote
 14 19 and of a person who provides their own proof of identification
 14 20 and who attests to the voter's identity. The bill provides
 14 21 that the oath shall be in the form prescribed by the state
 14 22 commissioner of elections, and that the oath shall state the
 14 23 identity of the person wishing to vote and shall attest to
 14 24 the stated identity of the person wishing to vote. The bill
 14 25 requires that the oath be signed by both the attesting person
 14 26 and the person wishing to vote. The bill makes it a class "D"
 14 27 felony to falsely swear to or affirm an oath pursuant to this
 14 28 provision or to falsely attest to a voter's identity. The bill
 14 29 requires that the oath advise both persons that falsely stating
 14 30 or attesting to a voter's identity is a class "D" felony. A
 14 31 class "D" felony is punishable by confinement for no more than
 14 32 five years and a fine of at least $750 but not more than $7,500.
 14 33 The bill provides that an attesting person is prohibited from
 14 34 signing any additional such oaths for the same election.
 14 35    The bill provides that if proof of identification is
 15  1 established the person shall then be allowed to vote. If a
 15  2 person is unable or refuses to present proof of identification,
 15  3 or if the precinct election official determines that the
 15  4 proof of identification does not meet specified requirements,
 15  5 the person shall be offered the option to vote a provisional
 15  6 ballot. If a person is casting a provisional ballot
 15  7 under these circumstances, the person shall receive a
 15  8 printed statement giving notice of the types of acceptable
 15  9 identification and notice that the person is required to show
 15 10 acceptable identification before the provisional ballot can
 15 11 be counted. However, the bill provides that a voter casting
 15 12 a provisional ballot for this reason may execute an affidavit
 15 13 in the form prescribed by the state commissioner of elections,
 15 14 affirming that the voter is the person the voter claims to be
 15 15 and affirming that the voter is either indigent and unable to
 15 16 obtain proof of identification without the payment of a fee or
 15 17 that the voter has a religious objection to being photographed.
 15 18    The bill makes it a class "D" felony to falsify an affidavit
 15 19 that attests to identity. A class "D" felony is punishable by
 15 20 confinement for no more than five years and a fine of at least
 15 21 $750 but not more than $7,500. The bill also provides that
 15 22 any provisional ballot cast accompanied by such an affidavit
 15 23 shall be presumed valid unless additional written statements
 15 24 or documents are delivered to the county commissioner of
 15 25 elections office prior to the date that provisional ballots
 15 26 are considered and the precinct election board determines that
 15 27 such additional evidence successfully rebuts the presumption
 15 28 of validity.
 15 29    The bill also makes changes to the election notice to be
 15 30 published by the county commissioner of elections to require
 15 31 that election notices include a statement that all voters will
 15 32 be required to show proof of identification before casting a
 15 33 ballot.
 15 34    The bill requires that persons residing in a hospital or
 15 35 health care facility who apply to vote by absentee ballot shall
 16  1 present proof of identification. If the applicant is unable to
 16  2 present proof of identification, the applicant shall be able
 16  3 to execute an affidavit in the form prescribed by the state
 16  4 commissioner of elections, stating that the applicant does not
 16  5 have and is unable to obtain proof of identification and that
 16  6 the applicant resides in a hospital or health care facility.
 16  7 If the applicant refuses to execute such an affidavit and is
 16  8 unable to present proof of identification, the voter is allowed
 16  9 to cast a provisional ballot. The bill further extends all
 16 10 provisions applying to balloting by residents of a health
 16 11 care facility and hospital patients to include tenants of an
 16 12 assisted living program.
 16 13    The bill also provides that a person obtaining a
 16 14 nonoperator's identification card for the purpose of voting
 16 15 shall not be charged for the issuance of the nonoperator's
 16 16 identification card. The bill requires that nonoperator's
 16 17 identification cards issued to serve as proof of identification
 16 18 for voting be labeled by the department as "For Voting Purposes
 16 19 Only".
 16 20    Division II of the bill makes conforming changes to certain
 16 21 required notices on forms related to voter registration and
 16 22 registration by mail.
 16 23    Division III of the bill provides that the bill applies to

 14 27 felony to falsely swear to or affirm an oath pursuant to this
 14 28 provision or to falsely attest to a voter's identity. The bill
 14 29 requires that the oath advise both persons that falsely stating

 13 22                           EXPLANATION
 13 23 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
 13 24 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
 13 25    This bill requires that a person provide certain proof of
 13 26 identification at the time that the person votes, modifies
 13 27 proof of identification and proof of residence requirements
 13 28 for election day and in=person absentee registration, modifies
 13 29 absentee voting procedures for eligible voters in assisted
 13 30 living programs, and creates a criminal offense for falsely
 13 31 swearing certain oaths and affidavits.
 13 32    Division I of the bill relates to voter identification
 13 33 requirements. The bill maintains current law allowing a person
 13 34 wishing to register to vote on election day, or in person when
 13 35 voting an absentee ballot, to establish proof of identity
 14  1 and proof of residence by written oath of a person who is
 14  2 registered to vote in the precinct, but requires that the oath
 14  3 of the person wishing to vote and the registered voter's oath
 14  4 be executed on the same piece of paper.
 14  5    The bill requires that a voter provide proof of
 14  6 identification to a precinct election official before being
 14  7 allowed to vote, and also requires that a person wishing to
 14  8 vote by absentee ballot at a county commissioner of elections
 14  9 office or at a satellite absentee voting station present
 14 10 the same proof of identification. The bill requires that
 14 11 acceptable proof of identification show the name of the
 14 12 individual voter, include a photograph of the voter, and be
 14 13 issued by the government of the United States, the state of
 14 14 Iowa, an Iowa public or private university or college, an Iowa
 14 15 secondary school, or a political subdivision of the state.
 14 16    The bill provides that, in lieu of providing identification
 14 17 in order to vote, a person may establish proof of
 14 18 identification by written oath of the person wishing to vote
 14 19 and of a person who provides their own proof of identification
 14 20 and who attests to the voter's identity. The bill provides
 14 21 that the oath shall be in the form prescribed by the state
 14 22 commissioner of elections, and that the oath shall state the
 14 23 identity of the person wishing to vote and shall attest to
 14 24 the stated identity of the person wishing to vote. The bill
 14 25 requires that the oath be signed by both the attesting person
 14 26 and the person wishing to vote. The bill makes it a class "D"
 14 27 felony to falsely swear to or affirm an oath pursuant to this
 14 28 provision or to falsely attest to a voter's identity. The bill
 14 29 requires that the oath advise both persons that falsely stating
 14 30 or attesting to a voter's identity is a class "D" felony. A
 14 31 class "D" felony is punishable by confinement for no more than
 14 32 five years and a fine of at least $750 but not more than $7,500.
 14 33 The bill provides that an attesting person is prohibited from
 14 34 signing any additional such oaths for the same election.
 14 35    The bill provides that if proof of identification is
 15  1 established the person shall then be allowed to vote. If a
 15  2 person is unable or refuses to present proof of identification,
 15  3 or if the precinct election official determines that the
 15  4 proof of identification does not meet specified requirements,
 15  5 the person shall be offered the option to vote a provisional
 15  6 ballot. If a person is casting a provisional ballot
 15  7 under these circumstances, the person shall receive a
 15  8 printed statement giving notice of the types of acceptable
 15  9 identification and notice that the person is required to show
 15 10 acceptable identification before the provisional ballot can
 15 11 be counted. However, the bill provides that a voter casting
 15 12 a provisional ballot for this reason may execute an affidavit
 15 13 in the form prescribed by the state commissioner of elections,
 15 14 affirming that the voter is the person the voter claims to be
 15 15 and affirming that the voter is either indigent and unable to
 15 16 obtain proof of identification without the payment of a fee or
 15 17 that the voter has a religious objection to being photographed.
 15 18    The bill makes it a class "D" felony to falsify an affidavit
 15 19 that attests to identity. A class "D" felony is punishable by
 15 20 confinement for no more than five years and a fine of at least
 15 21 $750 but not more than $7,500. The bill also provides that
 15 22 any provisional ballot cast accompanied by such an affidavit
 15 23 shall be presumed valid unless additional written statements
 15 24 or documents are delivered to the county commissioner of
 15 25 elections office prior to the date that provisional ballots
 15 26 are considered and the precinct election board determines that
 15 27 such additional evidence successfully rebuts the presumption
 15 28 of validity.
 15 29    The bill also makes changes to the election notice to be
 15 30 published by the county commissioner of elections to require
 15 31 that election notices include a statement that all voters will
 15 32 be required to show proof of identification before casting a
 15 33 ballot.
 15 34    The bill requires that persons residing in a hospital or
 15 35 health care facility who apply to vote by absentee ballot shall
 16  1 present proof of identification. If the applicant is unable to
 16  2 present proof of identification, the applicant shall be able
 16  3 to execute an affidavit in the form prescribed by the state
 16  4 commissioner of elections, stating that the applicant does not
 16  5 have and is unable to obtain proof of identification and that
 16  6 the applicant resides in a hospital or health care facility.
 16  7 If the applicant refuses to execute such an affidavit and is
 16  8 unable to present proof of identification, the voter is allowed
 16  9 to cast a provisional ballot. The bill further extends all
 16 10 provisions applying to balloting by residents of a health
 16 11 care facility and hospital patients to include tenants of an
 16 12 assisted living program.

 16 15 shall not be charged for the issuance of the nonoperator's

 16 10 provisions applying to balloting by residents of a health
 16 11 care facility and hospital patients to include tenants of an
 16 12 assisted living program.
 16 13    The bill also provides that a person obtaining a
 16 14 nonoperator's identification card for the purpose of voting
 16 15 shall not be charged for the issuance of the nonoperator's

 13 31 swearing certain oaths and affidavits.
 13 32    Division I of the bill relates to voter identification
 13 33 requirements. The bill maintains current law allowing a person
 13 34 wishing to register to vote on election day, or in person when
 13 35 voting an absentee ballot, to establish proof of identity
 14  1 and proof of residence by written oath of a person who is
 14  2 registered to vote in the precinct, but requires that the oath
 14  3 of the person wishing to vote and the registered voter's oath
 14  4 be executed on the same piece of paper.
 14  5    The bill requires that a voter provide proof of
 14  6 identification to a precinct election official before being
 14  7 allowed to vote, and also requires that a person wishing to
 14  8 vote by absentee ballot at a county commissioner of elections
 14  9 office or at a satellite absentee voting station present
 14 10 the same proof of identification. The bill requires that
 14 11 acceptable proof of identification show the name of the
 14 12 individual voter, include a photograph of the voter, and be
 14 13 issued by the government of the United States, the state of
 14 14 Iowa, an Iowa public or private university or college, an Iowa
 14 15 secondary school, or a political subdivision of the state.
 14 16    The bill provides that, in lieu of providing identification
 14 17 in order to vote, a person may establish proof of
 14 18 identification by written oath of the person wishing to vote
 14 19 and of a person who provides their own proof of identification
 14 20 and who attests to the voter's identity. The bill provides
 14 21 that the oath shall be in the form prescribed by the state
 14 22 commissioner of elections, and that the oath shall state the
 14 23 identity of the person wishing to vote and shall attest to
 14 24 the stated identity of the person wishing to vote. The bill
 14 25 requires that the oath be signed by both the attesting person
 14 26 and the person wishing to vote. The bill makes it a class "D"
 14 27 felony to falsely swear to or affirm an oath pursuant to this
 14 28 provision or to falsely attest to a voter's identity. The bill
 14 29 requires that the oath advise both persons that falsely stating
 14 30 or attesting to a voter's identity is a class "D" felony. A
 14 31 class "D" felony is punishable by confinement for no more than
 14 32 five years and a fine of at least $750 but not more than $7,500.
 14 33 The bill provides that an attesting person is prohibited from
 14 34 signing any additional such oaths for the same election.
 14 35    The bill provides that if proof of identification is
 15  1 established the person shall then be allowed to vote. If a
 15  2 person is unable or refuses to present proof of identification,
 15  3 or if the precinct election official determines that the
 15  4 proof of identification does not meet specified requirements,
 15  5 the person shall be offered the option to vote a provisional
 15  6 ballot. If a person is casting a provisional ballot
 15  7 under these circumstances, the person shall receive a
 15  8 printed statement giving notice of the types of acceptable
 15  9 identification and notice that the person is required to show
 15 10 acceptable identification before the provisional ballot can
 15 11 be counted. However, the bill provides that a voter casting
 15 12 a provisional ballot for this reason may execute an affidavit
 15 13 in the form prescribed by the state commissioner of elections,
 15 14 affirming that the voter is the person the voter claims to be
 15 15 and affirming that the voter is either indigent and unable to
 15 16 obtain proof of identification without the payment of a fee or
 15 17 that the voter has a religious objection to being photographed.
 15 18    The bill makes it a class "D" felony to falsify an affidavit
 15 19 that attests to identity. A class "D" felony is punishable by
 15 20 confinement for no more than five years and a fine of at least
 15 21 $750 but not more than $7,500. The bill also provides that
 15 22 any provisional ballot cast accompanied by such an affidavit
 15 23 shall be presumed valid unless additional written statements
 15 24 or documents are delivered to the county commissioner of
 15 25 elections office prior to the date that provisional ballots
 15 26 are considered and the precinct election board determines that
 15 27 such additional evidence successfully rebuts the presumption
 15 28 of validity.
 15 29    The bill also makes changes to the election notice to be
 15 30 published by the county commissioner of elections to require
 15 31 that election notices include a statement that all voters will
 15 32 be required to show proof of identification before casting a
 15 33 ballot.
 15 34    The bill requires that persons residing in a hospital or
 15 35 health care facility who apply to vote by absentee ballot shall
 16  1 present proof of identification. If the applicant is unable to
 16  2 present proof of identification, the applicant shall be able
 16  3 to execute an affidavit in the form prescribed by the state
 16  4 commissioner of elections, stating that the applicant does not
 16  5 have and is unable to obtain proof of identification and that
 16  6 the applicant resides in a hospital or health care facility.

 13 32    Division I of the bill relates to voter identification
 13 33 requirements. The bill maintains current law allowing a person
 13 34 wishing to register to vote on election day, or in person when
 13 35 voting an absentee ballot, to establish proof of identity
 14  1 and proof of residence by written oath of a person who is
 14  2 registered to vote in the precinct, but requires that the oath
 14  3 of the person wishing to vote and the registered voter's oath
 14  4 be executed on the same piece of paper.
 14  5    The bill requires that a voter provide proof of
 14  6 identification to a precinct election official before being
 14  7 allowed to vote, and also requires that a person wishing to
 14  8 vote by absentee ballot at a county commissioner of elections
 14  9 office or at a satellite absentee voting station present
 14 10 the same proof of identification. The bill requires that
 14 11 acceptable proof of identification show the name of the
 14 12 individual voter, include a photograph of the voter, and be
 14 13 issued by the government of the United States, the state of
 14 14 Iowa, an Iowa public or private university or college, an Iowa
 14 15 secondary school, or a political subdivision of the state.
 14 16    The bill provides that, in lieu of providing identification
 14 17 in order to vote, a person may establish proof of
 14 18 identification by written oath of the person wishing to vote
 14 19 and of a person who provides their own proof of identification
 14 20 and who attests to the voter's identity. The bill provides
 14 21 that the oath shall be in the form prescribed by the state
 14 22 commissioner of elections, and that the oath shall state the
 14 23 identity of the person wishing to vote and shall attest to
 14 24 the stated identity of the person wishing to vote. The bill
 14 25 requires that the oath be signed by both the attesting person
 14 26 and the person wishing to vote. The bill makes it a class "D"
 14 27 felony to falsely swear to or affirm an oath pursuant to this
 14 28 provision or to falsely attest to a voter's identity. The bill
 14 29 requires that the oath advise both persons that falsely stating
 14 30 or attesting to a voter's identity is a class "D" felony. A
 14 31 class "D" felony is punishable by confinement for no more than
 14 32 five years and a fine of at least $750 but not more than $7,500.
 14 33 The bill provides that an attesting person is prohibited from
 14 34 signing any additional such oaths for the same election.
 14 35    The bill provides that if proof of identification is
 15  1 established the person shall then be allowed to vote. If a
 15  2 person is unable or refuses to present proof of identification,
 15  3 or if the precinct election official determines that the
 15  4 proof of identification does not meet specified requirements,
 15  5 the person shall be offered the option to vote a provisional
 15  6 ballot. If a person is casting a provisional ballot
 15  7 under these circumstances, the person shall receive a
 15  8 printed statement giving notice of the types of acceptable
 15  9 identification and notice that the person is required to show
 15 10 acceptable identification before the provisional ballot can
 15 11 be counted. However, the bill provides that a voter casting
 15 12 a provisional ballot for this reason may execute an affidavit
 15 13 in the form prescribed by the state commissioner of elections,
 15 14 affirming that the voter is the person the voter claims to be
 15 15 and affirming that the voter is either indigent and unable to
 15 16 obtain proof of identification without the payment of a fee or
 15 17 that the voter has a religious objection to being photographed.
 15 18    The bill makes it a class "D" felony to falsify an affidavit
 15 19 that attests to identity. A class "D" felony is punishable by
 15 20 confinement for no more than five years and a fine of at least
 15 21 $750 but not more than $7,500. The bill also provides that
 15 22 any provisional ballot cast accompanied by such an affidavit
 15 23 shall be presumed valid unless additional written statements
 15 24 or documents are delivered to the county commissioner of
 15 25 elections office prior to the date that provisional ballots
 15 26 are considered and the precinct election board determines that
 15 27 such additional evidence successfully rebuts the presumption
 15 28 of validity.
 15 29    The bill also makes changes to the election notice to be
 15 30 published by the county commissioner of elections to require
 15 31 that election notices include a statement that all voters will
 15 32 be required to show proof of identification before casting a
 15 33 ballot.
 15 34    The bill requires that persons residing in a hospital or
 15 35 health care facility who apply to vote by absentee ballot shall
 16  1 present proof of identification. If the applicant is unable to
 16  2 present proof of identification, the applicant shall be able
 16  3 to execute an affidavit in the form prescribed by the state
 16  4 commissioner of elections, stating that the applicant does not
 16  5 have and is unable to obtain proof of identification and that
 16  6 the applicant resides in a hospital or health care facility.
 16  7 If the applicant refuses to execute such an affidavit and is
 16  8 unable to present proof of identification, the voter is allowed
 16  9 to cast a provisional ballot. The bill further extends all
 16 10 provisions applying to balloting by residents of a health
 16 11 care facility and hospital patients to include tenants of an
 16 12 assisted living program.
 16 13    The bill also provides that a person obtaining a
 16 14 nonoperator's identification card for the purpose of voting
 16 15 shall not be charged for the issuance of the nonoperator's
 16 16 identification card. The bill requires that nonoperator's

 14 25 requires that the oath be signed by both the attesting person
 14 26 and the person wishing to vote. The bill makes it a class "D"
 14 27 felony to falsely swear to or affirm an oath pursuant to this
 14 28 provision or to falsely attest to a voter's identity. The bill
 14 29 requires that the oath advise both persons that falsely stating
 14 30 or attesting to a voter's identity is a class "D" felony. A
 14 31 class "D" felony is punishable by confinement for no more than
 14 32 five years and a fine of at least $750 but not more than $7,500.
 14 33 The bill provides that an attesting person is prohibited from
 14 34 signing any additional such oaths for the same election.
 14 35    The bill provides that if proof of identification is
 15  1 established the person shall then be allowed to vote. If a
 15  2 person is unable or refuses to present proof of identification,
 15  3 or if the precinct election official determines that the
 15  4 proof of identification does not meet specified requirements,
 15  5 the person shall be offered the option to vote a provisional
 15  6 ballot. If a person is casting a provisional ballot
 15  7 under these circumstances, the person shall receive a
 15  8 printed statement giving notice of the types of acceptable
 15  9 identification and notice that the person is required to show
 15 10 acceptable identification before the provisional ballot can
 15 11 be counted. However, the bill provides that a voter casting
 15 12 a provisional ballot for this reason may execute an affidavit
 15 13 in the form prescribed by the state commissioner of elections,
 15 14 affirming that the voter is the person the voter claims to be
 15 15 and affirming that the voter is either indigent and unable to
 15 16 obtain proof of identification without the payment of a fee or
 15 17 that the voter has a religious objection to being photographed.
 15 18    The bill makes it a class "D" felony to falsify an affidavit

 15 20 confinement for no more than five years and a fine of at least
 15 21 $750 but not more than $7,500. The bill also provides that
 15 22 any provisional ballot cast accompanied by such an affidavit
 15 23 shall be presumed valid unless additional written statements
 15 24 or documents are delivered to the county commissioner of
 15 25 elections office prior to the date that provisional ballots
 15 26 are considered and the precinct election board determines that
 15 27 such additional evidence successfully rebuts the presumption
 15 28 of validity.
 15 29    The bill also makes changes to the election notice to be
 15 30 published by the county commissioner of elections to require
 15 31 that election notices include a statement that all voters will
 15 32 be required to show proof of identification before casting a
 15 33 ballot.
 15 34    The bill requires that persons residing in a hospital or
 15 35 health care facility who apply to vote by absentee ballot shall

 16  3 to execute an affidavit in the form prescribed by the state
 16  4 commissioner of elections, stating that the applicant does not
 16  5 have and is unable to obtain proof of identification and that
 16  6 the applicant resides in a hospital or health care facility.
 16  7 If the applicant refuses to execute such an affidavit and is
 16  8 unable to present proof of identification, the voter is allowed
 16  9 to cast a provisional ballot. The bill further extends all
 16 10 provisions applying to balloting by residents of a health
 16 11 care facility and hospital patients to include tenants of an
 16 12 assisted living program.
 16 13    The bill also provides that a person obtaining a
 16 14 nonoperator's identification card for the purpose of voting
 16 15 shall not be charged for the issuance of the nonoperator's
 16 16 identification card. The bill requires that nonoperator's
 16 17 identification cards issued to serve as proof of identification
 16 18 for voting be labeled by the department as "For Voting Purposes

 14  5    The bill requires that a voter provide proof of
 14  6 identification to a precinct election official before being
 14  7 allowed to vote, and also requires that a person wishing to
 14  8 vote by absentee ballot at a county commissioner of elections
 14  9 office or at a satellite absentee voting station present
 14 10 the same proof of identification. The bill requires that
 14 11 acceptable proof of identification show the name of the
 14 12 individual voter, include a photograph of the voter, and be
 14 13 issued by the government of the United States, the state of
 14 14 Iowa, an Iowa public or private university or college, an Iowa
 14 15 secondary school, or a political subdivision of the state.
 14 16    The bill provides that, in lieu of providing identification
 14 17 in order to vote, a person may establish proof of
 14 18 identification by written oath of the person wishing to vote
 14 19 and of a person who provides their own proof of identification
 14 20 and who attests to the voter's identity. The bill provides
 14 21 that the oath shall be in the form prescribed by the state
 14 22 commissioner of elections, and that the oath shall state the
 14 23 identity of the person wishing to vote and shall attest to
 14 24 the stated identity of the person wishing to vote. The bill
 14 25 requires that the oath be signed by both the attesting person
 14 26 and the person wishing to vote. The bill makes it a class "D"
 14 27 felony to falsely swear to or affirm an oath pursuant to this
 14 28 provision or to falsely attest to a voter's identity. The bill
 14 29 requires that the oath advise both persons that falsely stating
 14 30 or attesting to a voter's identity is a class "D" felony. A
 14 31 class "D" felony is punishable by confinement for no more than
 14 32 five years and a fine of at least $750 but not more than $7,500.
 14 33 The bill provides that an attesting person is prohibited from
 14 34 signing any additional such oaths for the same election.
 14 35    The bill provides that if proof of identification is
 15  1 established the person shall then be allowed to vote. If a
 15  2 person is unable or refuses to present proof of identification,
 15  3 or if the precinct election official determines that the
 15  4 proof of identification does not meet specified requirements,
 15  5 the person shall be offered the option to vote a provisional
 15  6 ballot. If a person is casting a provisional ballot
 15  7 under these circumstances, the person shall receive a
 15  8 printed statement giving notice of the types of acceptable
 15  9 identification and notice that the person is required to show
 15 10 acceptable identification before the provisional ballot can
 15 11 be counted. However, the bill provides that a voter casting
 15 12 a provisional ballot for this reason may execute an affidavit
 15 13 in the form prescribed by the state commissioner of elections,
 15 14 affirming that the voter is the person the voter claims to be
 15 15 and affirming that the voter is either indigent and unable to
 15 16 obtain proof of identification without the payment of a fee or
 15 17 that the voter has a religious objection to being photographed.
 15 18    The bill makes it a class "D" felony to falsify an affidavit
 15 19 that attests to identity. A class "D" felony is punishable by
 15 20 confinement for no more than five years and a fine of at least
 15 21 $750 but not more than $7,500. The bill also provides that
 15 22 any provisional ballot cast accompanied by such an affidavit
 15 23 shall be presumed valid unless additional written statements
 15 24 or documents are delivered to the county commissioner of
 15 25 elections office prior to the date that provisional ballots
 15 26 are considered and the precinct election board determines that
 15 27 such additional evidence successfully rebuts the presumption
 15 28 of validity.
 15 29    The bill also makes changes to the election notice to be
 15 30 published by the county commissioner of elections to require
 15 31 that election notices include a statement that all voters will
 15 32 be required to show proof of identification before casting a
 15 33 ballot.
 15 34    The bill requires that persons residing in a hospital or
 15 35 health care facility who apply to vote by absentee ballot shall

 16  4 commissioner of elections, stating that the applicant does not
 16  5 have and is unable to obtain proof of identification and that
