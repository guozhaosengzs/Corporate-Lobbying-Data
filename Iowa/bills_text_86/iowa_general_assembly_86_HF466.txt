  3 19 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  3 20 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  3 21    This bill grants an employee=owner, as defined in the

  3 26 capital stock of a qualified corporation. First, the stock
  3 27 must be either voting or nonvoting, common or preferred
  3 28 stock. Stock rights, stock warrants, stock options, and debt
  3 29 securities do not qualify. Second, the corporation that issued
  3 30 the stock must be in existence and actively doing business
  3 31 in Iowa for at least 10 years. A corporation that is part
  3 32 of an affiliated group will qualify if the affiliated group
  3 33 includes a member that has been in existence and actively doing
  3 34 business in Iowa for at least 10 years. Third, the corporation

  4  5 that was entirely or substantially tax free as long as the
  4  6 reorganization occurred during or after the employee=owner's
  4  7 employment.
  4  8    The election shall apply to all subsequent sales of the
  4  9 elected capital stock, provided it is capital stock in the same
  4 10 qualified corporation and was acquired on account of employment
  4 11 by the corporation and while employed by the corporation.
  4 12    The bill provides that the election applies to transfers of
  4 13 the capital stock by inter vivos gift from the employee=owner
  4 14 to a spouse or lineal descendant, or to a trust for the benefit
  4 15 of the employee=owner's spouse or lineal descendant. The
  4 16 election will apply to a spouse only if the spouse was married
  4 17 to the employee=owner on the date of the sale or the date of the
  4 18 employee=owner's death.
  4 19    If, after making a valid inter vivos transfer of stock that
  4 20 meets all the requirements for an election, an employee=owner
  4 21 dies without making an election, the surviving spouse, or if
  4 22 there is no surviving spouse, the personal representative of
  4 23 the employee=owner's estate may make the election.
  4 24    An election is made by including a written statement
  4 25 containing certain required information, as specified in the
  4 26 bill, with the taxpayer's Iowa income tax return for the
  4 27 taxable year in which the election is made.  The department of

  4 29 elections and reporting exclusions.
  4 30    The bill takes effect upon enactment and applies

  3 23 individual income tax the net capital gain from the sale of

  3 25 requirements must be met for capital stock to qualify as
  3 26 capital stock of a qualified corporation. First, the stock
  3 27 must be either voting or nonvoting, common or preferred
  3 28 stock. Stock rights, stock warrants, stock options, and debt
  3 29 securities do not qualify. Second, the corporation that issued
  3 30 the stock must be in existence and actively doing business
  3 31 in Iowa for at least 10 years. A corporation that is part
  3 32 of an affiliated group will qualify if the affiliated group
  3 33 includes a member that has been in existence and actively doing
  3 34 business in Iowa for at least 10 years. Third, the corporation
  3 35 that issued the stock must have at least five shareholders,
  4  1 two of whom must not be related. Fourth, the stock must have
  4  2 been acquired by the employee=owner on account of employment
  4  3 with the corporation and while employed by the corporation. A
  4  4 corporation will qualify if it is a party to a reorganization
  4  5 that was entirely or substantially tax free as long as the
  4  6 reorganization occurred during or after the employee=owner's
  4  7 employment.
  4  8    The election shall apply to all subsequent sales of the
  4  9 elected capital stock, provided it is capital stock in the same
  4 10 qualified corporation and was acquired on account of employment
  4 11 by the corporation and while employed by the corporation.
  4 12    The bill provides that the election applies to transfers of
  4 13 the capital stock by inter vivos gift from the employee=owner
  4 14 to a spouse or lineal descendant, or to a trust for the benefit
  4 15 of the employee=owner's spouse or lineal descendant. The
  4 16 election will apply to a spouse only if the spouse was married
  4 17 to the employee=owner on the date of the sale or the date of the
  4 18 employee=owner's death.
  4 19    If, after making a valid inter vivos transfer of stock that
  4 20 meets all the requirements for an election, an employee=owner
  4 21 dies without making an election, the surviving spouse, or if
  4 22 there is no surviving spouse, the personal representative of
  4 23 the employee=owner's estate may make the election.
  4 24    An election is made by including a written statement
  4 25 containing certain required information, as specified in the
  4 26 bill, with the taxpayer's Iowa income tax return for the
  4 27 taxable year in which the election is made.  The department of

  4 29 elections and reporting exclusions.
  4 30    The bill takes effect upon enactment and applies
  4 31 retroactively to January 1, 2015, for tax years beginning on
  4 32 or after that date.

  3 18                           EXPLANATION
  3 19 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  3 20 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  3 21    This bill grants an employee=owner, as defined in the
  3 22 bill, one irrevocable lifetime election to exclude from state
  3 23 individual income tax the net capital gain from the sale of
  3 24 the capital stock of one qualified corporation.  Several
  3 25 requirements must be met for capital stock to qualify as
  3 26 capital stock of a qualified corporation. First, the stock
  3 27 must be either voting or nonvoting, common or preferred
  3 28 stock. Stock rights, stock warrants, stock options, and debt
  3 29 securities do not qualify. Second, the corporation that issued
  3 30 the stock must be in existence and actively doing business
  3 31 in Iowa for at least 10 years. A corporation that is part
  3 32 of an affiliated group will qualify if the affiliated group
  3 33 includes a member that has been in existence and actively doing
  3 34 business in Iowa for at least 10 years. Third, the corporation
  3 35 that issued the stock must have at least five shareholders,
  4  1 two of whom must not be related. Fourth, the stock must have
  4  2 been acquired by the employee=owner on account of employment
  4  3 with the corporation and while employed by the corporation. A
  4  4 corporation will qualify if it is a party to a reorganization
  4  5 that was entirely or substantially tax free as long as the
  4  6 reorganization occurred during or after the employee=owner's
  4  7 employment.
  4  8    The election shall apply to all subsequent sales of the
  4  9 elected capital stock, provided it is capital stock in the same
  4 10 qualified corporation and was acquired on account of employment
  4 11 by the corporation and while employed by the corporation.
  4 12    The bill provides that the election applies to transfers of
  4 13 the capital stock by inter vivos gift from the employee=owner
  4 14 to a spouse or lineal descendant, or to a trust for the benefit
  4 15 of the employee=owner's spouse or lineal descendant. The
  4 16 election will apply to a spouse only if the spouse was married
  4 17 to the employee=owner on the date of the sale or the date of the
  4 18 employee=owner's death.
  4 19    If, after making a valid inter vivos transfer of stock that
  4 20 meets all the requirements for an election, an employee=owner
  4 21 dies without making an election, the surviving spouse, or if
  4 22 there is no surviving spouse, the personal representative of
  4 23 the employee=owner's estate may make the election.
  4 24    An election is made by including a written statement
  4 25 containing certain required information, as specified in the
  4 26 bill, with the taxpayer's Iowa income tax return for the
  4 27 taxable year in which the election is made.  The department of
  4 28 revenue is required to provide appropriate forms for making
  4 29 elections and reporting exclusions.
  4 30    The bill takes effect upon enactment and applies
  4 31 retroactively to January 1, 2015, for tax years beginning on
  4 32 or after that date.

  4 21 dies without making an election, the surviving spouse, or if
  4 22 there is no surviving spouse, the personal representative of
  4 23 the employee=owner's estate may make the election.
  4 24    An election is made by including a written statement
  4 25 containing certain required information, as specified in the

  3 25 requirements must be met for capital stock to qualify as
  3 26 capital stock of a qualified corporation. First, the stock
  3 27 must be either voting or nonvoting, common or preferred
  3 28 stock. Stock rights, stock warrants, stock options, and debt
  3 29 securities do not qualify. Second, the corporation that issued
  3 30 the stock must be in existence and actively doing business
  3 31 in Iowa for at least 10 years. A corporation that is part
  3 32 of an affiliated group will qualify if the affiliated group
  3 33 includes a member that has been in existence and actively doing
  3 34 business in Iowa for at least 10 years. Third, the corporation
  3 35 that issued the stock must have at least five shareholders,
  4  1 two of whom must not be related. Fourth, the stock must have
  4  2 been acquired by the employee=owner on account of employment
  4  3 with the corporation and while employed by the corporation. A
  4  4 corporation will qualify if it is a party to a reorganization
  4  5 that was entirely or substantially tax free as long as the
  4  6 reorganization occurred during or after the employee=owner's
  4  7 employment.
  4  8    The election shall apply to all subsequent sales of the
  4  9 elected capital stock, provided it is capital stock in the same
  4 10 qualified corporation and was acquired on account of employment
  4 11 by the corporation and while employed by the corporation.
  4 12    The bill provides that the election applies to transfers of
  4 13 the capital stock by inter vivos gift from the employee=owner
  4 14 to a spouse or lineal descendant, or to a trust for the benefit
  4 15 of the employee=owner's spouse or lineal descendant. The
  4 16 election will apply to a spouse only if the spouse was married
  4 17 to the employee=owner on the date of the sale or the date of the
  4 18 employee=owner's death.
  4 19    If, after making a valid inter vivos transfer of stock that
  4 20 meets all the requirements for an election, an employee=owner
  4 21 dies without making an election, the surviving spouse, or if
  4 22 there is no surviving spouse, the personal representative of
  4 23 the employee=owner's estate may make the election.
  4 24    An election is made by including a written statement
  4 25 containing certain required information, as specified in the
  4 26 bill, with the taxpayer's Iowa income tax return for the

  3 27 must be either voting or nonvoting, common or preferred
  3 28 stock. Stock rights, stock warrants, stock options, and debt
  3 29 securities do not qualify. Second, the corporation that issued
  3 30 the stock must be in existence and actively doing business

  3 32 of an affiliated group will qualify if the affiliated group

  4  9 elected capital stock, provided it is capital stock in the same
  4 10 qualified corporation and was acquired on account of employment
  4 11 by the corporation and while employed by the corporation.
  4 12    The bill provides that the election applies to transfers of
  4 13 the capital stock by inter vivos gift from the employee=owner
  4 14 to a spouse or lineal descendant, or to a trust for the benefit

  4 16 election will apply to a spouse only if the spouse was married
  4 17 to the employee=owner on the date of the sale or the date of the
  4 18 employee=owner's death.
  4 19    If, after making a valid inter vivos transfer of stock that
  4 20 meets all the requirements for an election, an employee=owner
  4 21 dies without making an election, the surviving spouse, or if
  4 22 there is no surviving spouse, the personal representative of
  4 23 the employee=owner's estate may make the election.
  4 24    An election is made by including a written statement

  3 19 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  3 20 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  3 21    This bill grants an employee=owner, as defined in the
  3 22 bill, one irrevocable lifetime election to exclude from state
  3 23 individual income tax the net capital gain from the sale of
  3 24 the capital stock of one qualified corporation.  Several
  3 25 requirements must be met for capital stock to qualify as
  3 26 capital stock of a qualified corporation. First, the stock
  3 27 must be either voting or nonvoting, common or preferred
  3 28 stock. Stock rights, stock warrants, stock options, and debt
  3 29 securities do not qualify. Second, the corporation that issued
  3 30 the stock must be in existence and actively doing business
  3 31 in Iowa for at least 10 years. A corporation that is part
  3 32 of an affiliated group will qualify if the affiliated group
  3 33 includes a member that has been in existence and actively doing
  3 34 business in Iowa for at least 10 years. Third, the corporation
  3 35 that issued the stock must have at least five shareholders,
  4  1 two of whom must not be related. Fourth, the stock must have
  4  2 been acquired by the employee=owner on account of employment
  4  3 with the corporation and while employed by the corporation. A
  4  4 corporation will qualify if it is a party to a reorganization
  4  5 that was entirely or substantially tax free as long as the
  4  6 reorganization occurred during or after the employee=owner's
  4  7 employment.
  4  8    The election shall apply to all subsequent sales of the
  4  9 elected capital stock, provided it is capital stock in the same
  4 10 qualified corporation and was acquired on account of employment
  4 11 by the corporation and while employed by the corporation.
  4 12    The bill provides that the election applies to transfers of
  4 13 the capital stock by inter vivos gift from the employee=owner
  4 14 to a spouse or lineal descendant, or to a trust for the benefit
  4 15 of the employee=owner's spouse or lineal descendant. The
  4 16 election will apply to a spouse only if the spouse was married
  4 17 to the employee=owner on the date of the sale or the date of the
  4 18 employee=owner's death.
  4 19    If, after making a valid inter vivos transfer of stock that
  4 20 meets all the requirements for an election, an employee=owner
  4 21 dies without making an election, the surviving spouse, or if
  4 22 there is no surviving spouse, the personal representative of
  4 23 the employee=owner's estate may make the election.
  4 24    An election is made by including a written statement
  4 25 containing certain required information, as specified in the
  4 26 bill, with the taxpayer's Iowa income tax return for the
  4 27 taxable year in which the election is made.  The department of
  4 28 revenue is required to provide appropriate forms for making
  4 29 elections and reporting exclusions.
  4 30    The bill takes effect upon enactment and applies
  4 31 retroactively to January 1, 2015, for tax years beginning on

  3 19 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  3 20 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  3 21    This bill grants an employee=owner, as defined in the
  3 22 bill, one irrevocable lifetime election to exclude from state
  3 23 individual income tax the net capital gain from the sale of
  3 24 the capital stock of one qualified corporation.  Several
  3 25 requirements must be met for capital stock to qualify as
  3 26 capital stock of a qualified corporation. First, the stock
  3 27 must be either voting or nonvoting, common or preferred
  3 28 stock. Stock rights, stock warrants, stock options, and debt
  3 29 securities do not qualify. Second, the corporation that issued
  3 30 the stock must be in existence and actively doing business
  3 31 in Iowa for at least 10 years. A corporation that is part
  3 32 of an affiliated group will qualify if the affiliated group
  3 33 includes a member that has been in existence and actively doing
  3 34 business in Iowa for at least 10 years. Third, the corporation
  3 35 that issued the stock must have at least five shareholders,
  4  1 two of whom must not be related. Fourth, the stock must have
  4  2 been acquired by the employee=owner on account of employment
  4  3 with the corporation and while employed by the corporation. A
  4  4 corporation will qualify if it is a party to a reorganization
  4  5 that was entirely or substantially tax free as long as the
  4  6 reorganization occurred during or after the employee=owner's
  4  7 employment.
  4  8    The election shall apply to all subsequent sales of the
  4  9 elected capital stock, provided it is capital stock in the same
  4 10 qualified corporation and was acquired on account of employment
  4 11 by the corporation and while employed by the corporation.
  4 12    The bill provides that the election applies to transfers of
  4 13 the capital stock by inter vivos gift from the employee=owner
  4 14 to a spouse or lineal descendant, or to a trust for the benefit
  4 15 of the employee=owner's spouse or lineal descendant. The
  4 16 election will apply to a spouse only if the spouse was married
  4 17 to the employee=owner on the date of the sale or the date of the
  4 18 employee=owner's death.
  4 19    If, after making a valid inter vivos transfer of stock that
  4 20 meets all the requirements for an election, an employee=owner
  4 21 dies without making an election, the surviving spouse, or if
  4 22 there is no surviving spouse, the personal representative of
  4 23 the employee=owner's estate may make the election.
  4 24    An election is made by including a written statement
  4 25 containing certain required information, as specified in the
  4 26 bill, with the taxpayer's Iowa income tax return for the
  4 27 taxable year in which the election is made.  The department of
  4 28 revenue is required to provide appropriate forms for making
  4 29 elections and reporting exclusions.
  4 30    The bill takes effect upon enactment and applies

  3 27 must be either voting or nonvoting, common or preferred
  3 28 stock. Stock rights, stock warrants, stock options, and debt
  3 29 securities do not qualify. Second, the corporation that issued

  3 26 capital stock of a qualified corporation. First, the stock
  3 27 must be either voting or nonvoting, common or preferred
  3 28 stock. Stock rights, stock warrants, stock options, and debt
  3 29 securities do not qualify. Second, the corporation that issued
  3 30 the stock must be in existence and actively doing business
  3 31 in Iowa for at least 10 years. A corporation that is part
  3 32 of an affiliated group will qualify if the affiliated group
  3 33 includes a member that has been in existence and actively doing
  3 34 business in Iowa for at least 10 years. Third, the corporation

  4  9 elected capital stock, provided it is capital stock in the same
  4 10 qualified corporation and was acquired on account of employment

  4 13 the capital stock by inter vivos gift from the employee=owner
  4 14 to a spouse or lineal descendant, or to a trust for the benefit
  4 15 of the employee=owner's spouse or lineal descendant. The
  4 16 election will apply to a spouse only if the spouse was married
  4 17 to the employee=owner on the date of the sale or the date of the
  4 18 employee=owner's death.
  4 19    If, after making a valid inter vivos transfer of stock that
  4 20 meets all the requirements for an election, an employee=owner
  4 21 dies without making an election, the surviving spouse, or if
  4 22 there is no surviving spouse, the personal representative of
  4 23 the employee=owner's estate may make the election.
  4 24    An election is made by including a written statement
  4 25 containing certain required information, as specified in the
  4 26 bill, with the taxpayer's Iowa income tax return for the

  3 21    This bill grants an employee=owner, as defined in the
  3 22 bill, one irrevocable lifetime election to exclude from state
  3 23 individual income tax the net capital gain from the sale of
  3 24 the capital stock of one qualified corporation.  Several
  3 25 requirements must be met for capital stock to qualify as
  3 26 capital stock of a qualified corporation. First, the stock
  3 27 must be either voting or nonvoting, common or preferred
  3 28 stock. Stock rights, stock warrants, stock options, and debt
  3 29 securities do not qualify. Second, the corporation that issued
  3 30 the stock must be in existence and actively doing business
  3 31 in Iowa for at least 10 years. A corporation that is part
  3 32 of an affiliated group will qualify if the affiliated group
  3 33 includes a member that has been in existence and actively doing
  3 34 business in Iowa for at least 10 years. Third, the corporation
  3 35 that issued the stock must have at least five shareholders,

  4  5 that was entirely or substantially tax free as long as the
  4  6 reorganization occurred during or after the employee=owner's
  4  7 employment.
  4  8    The election shall apply to all subsequent sales of the
  4  9 elected capital stock, provided it is capital stock in the same
  4 10 qualified corporation and was acquired on account of employment
  4 11 by the corporation and while employed by the corporation.
  4 12    The bill provides that the election applies to transfers of
  4 13 the capital stock by inter vivos gift from the employee=owner
  4 14 to a spouse or lineal descendant, or to a trust for the benefit
  4 15 of the employee=owner's spouse or lineal descendant. The
  4 16 election will apply to a spouse only if the spouse was married
  4 17 to the employee=owner on the date of the sale or the date of the
  4 18 employee=owner's death.
  4 19    If, after making a valid inter vivos transfer of stock that
  4 20 meets all the requirements for an election, an employee=owner
  4 21 dies without making an election, the surviving spouse, or if
  4 22 there is no surviving spouse, the personal representative of
  4 23 the employee=owner's estate may make the election.
  4 24    An election is made by including a written statement
  4 25 containing certain required information, as specified in the
  4 26 bill, with the taxpayer's Iowa income tax return for the
  4 27 taxable year in which the election is made.  The department of

  3 19 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  3 20 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  3 21    This bill grants an employee=owner, as defined in the
  3 22 bill, one irrevocable lifetime election to exclude from state
  3 23 individual income tax the net capital gain from the sale of
  3 24 the capital stock of one qualified corporation.  Several
  3 25 requirements must be met for capital stock to qualify as
  3 26 capital stock of a qualified corporation. First, the stock
  3 27 must be either voting or nonvoting, common or preferred
  3 28 stock. Stock rights, stock warrants, stock options, and debt
  3 29 securities do not qualify. Second, the corporation that issued
  3 30 the stock must be in existence and actively doing business
  3 31 in Iowa for at least 10 years. A corporation that is part
  3 32 of an affiliated group will qualify if the affiliated group
  3 33 includes a member that has been in existence and actively doing
  3 34 business in Iowa for at least 10 years. Third, the corporation
  3 35 that issued the stock must have at least five shareholders,
  4  1 two of whom must not be related. Fourth, the stock must have
  4  2 been acquired by the employee=owner on account of employment
  4  3 with the corporation and while employed by the corporation. A
  4  4 corporation will qualify if it is a party to a reorganization
  4  5 that was entirely or substantially tax free as long as the
  4  6 reorganization occurred during or after the employee=owner's
  4  7 employment.
  4  8    The election shall apply to all subsequent sales of the
  4  9 elected capital stock, provided it is capital stock in the same
  4 10 qualified corporation and was acquired on account of employment
  4 11 by the corporation and while employed by the corporation.
  4 12    The bill provides that the election applies to transfers of
  4 13 the capital stock by inter vivos gift from the employee=owner
  4 14 to a spouse or lineal descendant, or to a trust for the benefit
  4 15 of the employee=owner's spouse or lineal descendant. The
  4 16 election will apply to a spouse only if the spouse was married
  4 17 to the employee=owner on the date of the sale or the date of the
  4 18 employee=owner's death.
  4 19    If, after making a valid inter vivos transfer of stock that
  4 20 meets all the requirements for an election, an employee=owner
  4 21 dies without making an election, the surviving spouse, or if
  4 22 there is no surviving spouse, the personal representative of
  4 23 the employee=owner's estate may make the election.
  4 24    An election is made by including a written statement
  4 25 containing certain required information, as specified in the
  4 26 bill, with the taxpayer's Iowa income tax return for the
  4 27 taxable year in which the election is made.  The department of
  4 28 revenue is required to provide appropriate forms for making
  4 29 elections and reporting exclusions.
  4 30    The bill takes effect upon enactment and applies

  3 25 requirements must be met for capital stock to qualify as
  3 26 capital stock of a qualified corporation. First, the stock
  3 27 must be either voting or nonvoting, common or preferred
  3 28 stock. Stock rights, stock warrants, stock options, and debt
  3 29 securities do not qualify. Second, the corporation that issued
  3 30 the stock must be in existence and actively doing business
  3 31 in Iowa for at least 10 years. A corporation that is part
  3 32 of an affiliated group will qualify if the affiliated group
  3 33 includes a member that has been in existence and actively doing
  3 34 business in Iowa for at least 10 years. Third, the corporation
  3 35 that issued the stock must have at least five shareholders,
  4  1 two of whom must not be related. Fourth, the stock must have
  4  2 been acquired by the employee=owner on account of employment
  4  3 with the corporation and while employed by the corporation. A
  4  4 corporation will qualify if it is a party to a reorganization
  4  5 that was entirely or substantially tax free as long as the
  4  6 reorganization occurred during or after the employee=owner's
  4  7 employment.
  4  8    The election shall apply to all subsequent sales of the
  4  9 elected capital stock, provided it is capital stock in the same
  4 10 qualified corporation and was acquired on account of employment
  4 11 by the corporation and while employed by the corporation.
  4 12    The bill provides that the election applies to transfers of
  4 13 the capital stock by inter vivos gift from the employee=owner
  4 14 to a spouse or lineal descendant, or to a trust for the benefit
  4 15 of the employee=owner's spouse or lineal descendant. The
  4 16 election will apply to a spouse only if the spouse was married
  4 17 to the employee=owner on the date of the sale or the date of the
  4 18 employee=owner's death.
  4 19    If, after making a valid inter vivos transfer of stock that
  4 20 meets all the requirements for an election, an employee=owner
  4 21 dies without making an election, the surviving spouse, or if
  4 22 there is no surviving spouse, the personal representative of
  4 23 the employee=owner's estate may make the election.
  4 24    An election is made by including a written statement

  3 19 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  3 20 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  3 21    This bill grants an employee=owner, as defined in the
  3 22 bill, one irrevocable lifetime election to exclude from state
  3 23 individual income tax the net capital gain from the sale of
  3 24 the capital stock of one qualified corporation.  Several
  3 25 requirements must be met for capital stock to qualify as
  3 26 capital stock of a qualified corporation. First, the stock
  3 27 must be either voting or nonvoting, common or preferred
  3 28 stock. Stock rights, stock warrants, stock options, and debt
  3 29 securities do not qualify. Second, the corporation that issued
  3 30 the stock must be in existence and actively doing business
  3 31 in Iowa for at least 10 years. A corporation that is part
  3 32 of an affiliated group will qualify if the affiliated group
  3 33 includes a member that has been in existence and actively doing
  3 34 business in Iowa for at least 10 years. Third, the corporation
  3 35 that issued the stock must have at least five shareholders,
  4  1 two of whom must not be related. Fourth, the stock must have
  4  2 been acquired by the employee=owner on account of employment
  4  3 with the corporation and while employed by the corporation. A
  4  4 corporation will qualify if it is a party to a reorganization
  4  5 that was entirely or substantially tax free as long as the
  4  6 reorganization occurred during or after the employee=owner's
  4  7 employment.
  4  8    The election shall apply to all subsequent sales of the
  4  9 elected capital stock, provided it is capital stock in the same
  4 10 qualified corporation and was acquired on account of employment
  4 11 by the corporation and while employed by the corporation.
  4 12    The bill provides that the election applies to transfers of
  4 13 the capital stock by inter vivos gift from the employee=owner
  4 14 to a spouse or lineal descendant, or to a trust for the benefit
  4 15 of the employee=owner's spouse or lineal descendant. The
  4 16 election will apply to a spouse only if the spouse was married
  4 17 to the employee=owner on the date of the sale or the date of the
  4 18 employee=owner's death.
  4 19    If, after making a valid inter vivos transfer of stock that
  4 20 meets all the requirements for an election, an employee=owner
  4 21 dies without making an election, the surviving spouse, or if
  4 22 there is no surviving spouse, the personal representative of
  4 23 the employee=owner's estate may make the election.
  4 24    An election is made by including a written statement
  4 25 containing certain required information, as specified in the
  4 26 bill, with the taxpayer's Iowa income tax return for the
  4 27 taxable year in which the election is made.  The department of
  4 28 revenue is required to provide appropriate forms for making
  4 29 elections and reporting exclusions.
  4 30    The bill takes effect upon enactment and applies
  4 31 retroactively to January 1, 2015, for tax years beginning on
  4 32 or after that date.

  3 21    This bill grants an employee=owner, as defined in the
  3 22 bill, one irrevocable lifetime election to exclude from state
  3 23 individual income tax the net capital gain from the sale of
  3 24 the capital stock of one qualified corporation.  Several
  3 25 requirements must be met for capital stock to qualify as
  3 26 capital stock of a qualified corporation. First, the stock
  3 27 must be either voting or nonvoting, common or preferred
  3 28 stock. Stock rights, stock warrants, stock options, and debt
  3 29 securities do not qualify. Second, the corporation that issued
  3 30 the stock must be in existence and actively doing business
  3 31 in Iowa for at least 10 years. A corporation that is part
  3 32 of an affiliated group will qualify if the affiliated group
  3 33 includes a member that has been in existence and actively doing
  3 34 business in Iowa for at least 10 years. Third, the corporation
  3 35 that issued the stock must have at least five shareholders,
  4  1 two of whom must not be related. Fourth, the stock must have
  4  2 been acquired by the employee=owner on account of employment
  4  3 with the corporation and while employed by the corporation. A
  4  4 corporation will qualify if it is a party to a reorganization
  4  5 that was entirely or substantially tax free as long as the
  4  6 reorganization occurred during or after the employee=owner's
  4  7 employment.
  4  8    The election shall apply to all subsequent sales of the
  4  9 elected capital stock, provided it is capital stock in the same
  4 10 qualified corporation and was acquired on account of employment
  4 11 by the corporation and while employed by the corporation.
  4 12    The bill provides that the election applies to transfers of
  4 13 the capital stock by inter vivos gift from the employee=owner
  4 14 to a spouse or lineal descendant, or to a trust for the benefit
  4 15 of the employee=owner's spouse or lineal descendant. The
  4 16 election will apply to a spouse only if the spouse was married
  4 17 to the employee=owner on the date of the sale or the date of the
  4 18 employee=owner's death.
  4 19    If, after making a valid inter vivos transfer of stock that
  4 20 meets all the requirements for an election, an employee=owner
  4 21 dies without making an election, the surviving spouse, or if
  4 22 there is no surviving spouse, the personal representative of
  4 23 the employee=owner's estate may make the election.
  4 24    An election is made by including a written statement
  4 25 containing certain required information, as specified in the
  4 26 bill, with the taxpayer's Iowa income tax return for the
  4 27 taxable year in which the election is made.  The department of
