EXPLANATION
23


The
inclusion
of
this
explanation
does
not
constitute
agreement
with
24


the
explanation’s
substance
by
the
members
of
the
general
assembly.
25


This
bill
relates
to
the
use
of
electronic
communication
26


devices
while
driving
and
makes
penalties
applicable.
27


Current
law
prohibits
the
use
of
an
electronic
device
to
28


write,
send,
or
read
a
text
message
while
operating
a
motor
29


vehicle.
The
bill
expands
this
prohibition
to
include

provides

paragraph

“b”,
including
a
member
of
a
public
safety
agency
performing
1


official
duties,
a
health
care
professional
in
the
course
of
2


an
emergency
situation,
and
a
person
receiving
safety-related
3


information
including
emergency,
traffic,
or
weather
alerts.
4


The
bill
also
does
not
change
the
existing
exception
for
use
of
5


global
positioning
or
navigation
systems.
However,
the
bill
6


provides
that
the
exceptions
relating
to
global
positioning
or
7


navigation
systems,
hands-free
or
voice
activated
mode,
and
8


emergency,
traffic,
or
weather
alerts
are
not
applicable
within
9


200
feet
of
a
school,
in
a
road
work
zone,
or
to
persons
with
10


temporary,
intermediate,
instructional,
or
restricted
licenses.
11


The
bill
eliminates
a
provision
prohibiting
a
peace
officer
12


from
stopping
or
detaining
a
person
solely
for
a
violation
of
13


Code
section
321.276.
14


The
bill
rewords
the
applicable
scheduled
fine
provision
15


to
comply
with
the
bill.
The
scheduled
fine
for
a
violation
16


of
Code
section
321.276
remains
$30.
Under
current
law,
the
17


offense
is
not
a
moving
violation,
and
therefore
cannot
be
18


considered
for
purposes
of
administrative
suspension
of
a
19


driver’s
license
or
to
establish
habitual
offender
status.
20


However,
if
the
violation
causes
a
serious
injury,
a
court
21


could
impose
an
additional
fine
of
$500
or
suspend
the
person’s
22


driver’s
license
for
not
more
than
90
days,
or
both.
If
the
23


violation
causes
a
death,
a
court
could
impose
an
additional
24


fine
of
$1,000
or
suspend
the
person’s
driver’s
license
for
not
25


more
than
180
days,
or
both.
