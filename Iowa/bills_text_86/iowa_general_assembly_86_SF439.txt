  9 24 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  9 25 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  9 26    This bill creates an Iowa ABLE (Achieving A Better Life
  9 27 Experience) savings plan trust and provides for various Iowa
  9 28 individual income tax and inheritance tax benefits.
  9 29    BACKGROUND.  On December 19, 2014, the federal Achieving
  9 30 A Better Life Experience Act of 2014 (ABLE Act) was enacted
  9 31 as part of the federal Tax Increase Prevention Act of 2014
  9 32 (Pub. L. No. 113=295).  The ABLE Act allows states to create
  9 33 programs to assist individuals in saving private funds for
  9 34 the purpose of supporting individuals with disabilities.
  9 35 Qualifying state programs will allow for the establishment
 10  1 of accounts into which eligible disabled individuals or
 10  2 others may make contributions for the payment of future
 10  3 disability=related expenses of the eligible disabled
 10  4 individual.  Funds and earnings in accounts established
 10  5 under qualifying state programs are afforded federal benefits
 10  6 in certain circumstances, including federal tax exemption,
 10  7 bankruptcy protection, and exclusion from consideration under
 10  8 certain means=tested programs, such as Medicaid or supplemental
 10  9 security income.
 10 10    IOWA ABLE SAVINGS PLAN TRUST.  The bill creates the Iowa
 10 11 ABLE savings plan trust (trust) under the treasurer of state
 10 12 (state treasurer) that will meet the requirements of {529A of
 10 13 the Internal Revenue Code (federal ABLE program).  The state
 10 14 treasurer is the trustee of the trust and has numerous powers,
 10 15 as specified in the bill, for the purpose of carrying out the
 10 16 purpose of the trust.
 10 17    The trust is authorized to enter into participation
 10 18 agreements with individuals for the payment of future qualified
 10 19 disability expenses.  "Qualified disability expenses" means the
 10 20 same as defined under the federal ABLE program, which generally
 10 21 defines the term to include expenses related to a designated
 10 22 beneficiary's education, housing, transportation, employment
 10 23 training and support, assistive technology and personal support
 10 24 services, health, prevention and wellness, financial management
 10 25 and administrative services, legal fees, expenses for oversight
 10 26 and monitoring, funeral and burial expenses, and other expenses
 10 27 approved by the secretary of the United States treasury
 10 28 (secretary).
 10 29    The person with whom the state treasurer enters into a
 10 30 participation agreement must be both the account owner and
 10 31 designated beneficiary.  However, the bill allows a trustee
 10 32 or legal guardian to be designated as custodian of an account
 10 33 for a designated beneficiary who is a minor or who lacks
 10 34 capacity to enter into a participation agreement, provided such
 10 35 designation would be allowed under the federal ABLE program.
 11  1 "Designated beneficiary" is defined in the bill as a person
 11  2 who is a resident of Iowa and who qualifies as an eligible
 11  3 individual under the federal ABLE program, which includes
 11  4 individuals who are entitled to benefits based on blindness or
 11  5 disability under Title II (disability insurance) or Title XVI
 11  6 (supplemental security income) of the federal Social Security
 11  7 Act if such blindness or disability occurred before attaining
 11  8 26 years of age, and if such individual files a disability
 11  9 certification with the secretary.
 11 10    The bill requires the state treasurer to maintain a separate
 11 11 account in the trust for each designated beneficiary of a
 11 12 participation agreement.  Only one participation agreement
 11 13 shall be allowed per designated beneficiary.  Any person is
 11 14 allowed to make contributions in the form of cash to an account
 11 15 on behalf of a designated beneficiary.  The trust is required
 11 16 to maintain limits on the annual contributions to an account,
 11 17 and the aggregate balance in an account, matching those set
 11 18 forth in the federal ABLE program, which prohibits annual
 11 19 contributions to an account from exceeding the annual gift tax
 11 20 exclusion amount ($14,000 for 2015), and prohibits an aggregate
 11 21 account balance from exceeding the limit set by a state under
 11 22 its qualified tuition program (currently $320,000 for Iowa).
 11 23    The bill provides other various terms and conditions for
 11 24 participation agreements, use and segregation of trust funds,
 11 25 cancellation of agreements and refund of account balances,
 11 26 and ownership rights in the trust.  The bill provides that an
 11 27 account may be claimed by the Iowa Medicaid program upon the
 11 28 death of the designated beneficiary, in accordance with the
 11 29 federal ABLE program.  The bill requires the state treasurer to
 11 30 prepare and submit audited financial reports to the governor
 11 31 and general assembly, and further requires the state treasurer
 11 32 to comply with any reporting requirements of the federal ABLE
 11 33 program. The bill applies to qualified disability expenses
 11 34 incurred on or after July 1, 2015.
 11 35    IOWA TAX BENEFITS.  The bill provides several tax benefits
 12  1 under the trust.  First, the value of any interest in the trust
 12  2 of a decedent dying on or after July 1, 2015, is excluded
 12  3 from the Iowa inheritance tax.  Second, contributions to the
 12  4 trust made on or after July 1, 2015, on behalf of a designated
 12  5 beneficiary are deductible from the Iowa individual income
 12  6 tax up to the maximum amount allowed per beneficiary per year
 12  7 for purposes of the Iowa educational savings plan trust in
 12  8 Code chapter 12D.  For 2015, that amount is set at $3,163.
 12  9 Any amounts refunded to a taxpayer from the cancellation of
 12 10 a participation agreement or that are withdrawn for purposes
 12 11 other than the payment of qualified disability expenses of the
 12 12 designated beneficiary must be included in Iowa net income to
 12 13 the extent they were previously deducted by the taxpayer or any
 12 14 other person as a contribution.  Third, income and earnings
 12 15 from the trust are exempt from the Iowa individual income tax.
 12 16 The individual income tax benefits apply retroactively to
 12 17 January 1, 2015, for tax years beginning on or after that date.

 10 17    The trust is authorized to enter into participation

  9 26    This bill creates an Iowa ABLE (Achieving A Better Life
  9 27 Experience) savings plan trust and provides for various Iowa
  9 28 individual income tax and inheritance tax benefits.
  9 29    BACKGROUND.  On December 19, 2014, the federal Achieving
  9 30 A Better Life Experience Act of 2014 (ABLE Act) was enacted
  9 31 as part of the federal Tax Increase Prevention Act of 2014
  9 32 (Pub. L. No. 113=295).  The ABLE Act allows states to create
  9 33 programs to assist individuals in saving private funds for
  9 34 the purpose of supporting individuals with disabilities.
  9 35 Qualifying state programs will allow for the establishment
 10  1 of accounts into which eligible disabled individuals or
 10  2 others may make contributions for the payment of future
 10  3 disability=related expenses of the eligible disabled
 10  4 individual.  Funds and earnings in accounts established
 10  5 under qualifying state programs are afforded federal benefits
 10  6 in certain circumstances, including federal tax exemption,
 10  7 bankruptcy protection, and exclusion from consideration under
 10  8 certain means=tested programs, such as Medicaid or supplemental
 10  9 security income.
 10 10    IOWA ABLE SAVINGS PLAN TRUST.  The bill creates the Iowa
 10 11 ABLE savings plan trust (trust) under the treasurer of state
 10 12 (state treasurer) that will meet the requirements of {529A of
 10 13 the Internal Revenue Code (federal ABLE program).  The state
 10 14 treasurer is the trustee of the trust and has numerous powers,
 10 15 as specified in the bill, for the purpose of carrying out the
 10 16 purpose of the trust.
 10 17    The trust is authorized to enter into participation
 10 18 agreements with individuals for the payment of future qualified
 10 19 disability expenses.  "Qualified disability expenses" means the
 10 20 same as defined under the federal ABLE program, which generally

 10 22 beneficiary's education, housing, transportation, employment
 10 23 training and support, assistive technology and personal support

 10 25 and administrative services, legal fees, expenses for oversight
 10 26 and monitoring, funeral and burial expenses, and other expenses

 10 28 (secretary).
 10 29    The person with whom the state treasurer enters into a
 10 30 participation agreement must be both the account owner and

 11  6 (supplemental security income) of the federal Social Security
 11  7 Act if such blindness or disability occurred before attaining
 11  8 26 years of age, and if such individual files a disability
 11  9 certification with the secretary.
 11 10    The bill requires the state treasurer to maintain a separate
 11 11 account in the trust for each designated beneficiary of a
 11 12 participation agreement.  Only one participation agreement
 11 13 shall be allowed per designated beneficiary.  Any person is
 11 14 allowed to make contributions in the form of cash to an account
 11 15 on behalf of a designated beneficiary.  The trust is required
 11 16 to maintain limits on the annual contributions to an account,
 11 17 and the aggregate balance in an account, matching those set
 11 18 forth in the federal ABLE program, which prohibits annual
 11 19 contributions to an account from exceeding the annual gift tax
 11 20 exclusion amount ($14,000 for 2015), and prohibits an aggregate
 11 21 account balance from exceeding the limit set by a state under
 11 22 its qualified tuition program (currently $320,000 for Iowa).
 11 23    The bill provides other various terms and conditions for
 11 24 participation agreements, use and segregation of trust funds,
 11 25 cancellation of agreements and refund of account balances,
 11 26 and ownership rights in the trust.  The bill provides that an
 11 27 account may be claimed by the Iowa Medicaid program upon the
 11 28 death of the designated beneficiary, in accordance with the
 11 29 federal ABLE program.  The bill requires the state treasurer to

 12  7 for purposes of the Iowa educational savings plan trust in
 12  8 Code chapter 12D.  For 2015, that amount is set at $3,163.
 12  9 Any amounts refunded to a taxpayer from the cancellation of
 12 10 a participation agreement or that are withdrawn for purposes
 12 11 other than the payment of qualified disability expenses of the
 12 12 designated beneficiary must be included in Iowa net income to

 10 31 designated beneficiary.  However, the bill allows a trustee
 10 32 or legal guardian to be designated as custodian of an account

 11 10    The bill requires the state treasurer to maintain a separate
 11 11 account in the trust for each designated beneficiary of a

 11 15 on behalf of a designated beneficiary.  The trust is required
 11 16 to maintain limits on the annual contributions to an account,
 11 17 and the aggregate balance in an account, matching those set
 11 18 forth in the federal ABLE program, which prohibits annual
 11 19 contributions to an account from exceeding the annual gift tax
 11 20 exclusion amount ($14,000 for 2015), and prohibits an aggregate
 11 21 account balance from exceeding the limit set by a state under
 11 22 its qualified tuition program (currently $320,000 for Iowa).
 11 23    The bill provides other various terms and conditions for
 11 24 participation agreements, use and segregation of trust funds,
 11 25 cancellation of agreements and refund of account balances,
 11 26 and ownership rights in the trust.  The bill provides that an

 10 29    The person with whom the state treasurer enters into a
 10 30 participation agreement must be both the account owner and
 10 31 designated beneficiary.  However, the bill allows a trustee
 10 32 or legal guardian to be designated as custodian of an account

 11 10    The bill requires the state treasurer to maintain a separate
 11 11 account in the trust for each designated beneficiary of a

 11 13 shall be allowed per designated beneficiary.  Any person is

 11 15 on behalf of a designated beneficiary.  The trust is required
 11 16 to maintain limits on the annual contributions to an account,
 11 17 and the aggregate balance in an account, matching those set
 11 18 forth in the federal ABLE program, which prohibits annual
 11 19 contributions to an account from exceeding the annual gift tax
 11 20 exclusion amount ($14,000 for 2015), and prohibits an aggregate
 11 21 account balance from exceeding the limit set by a state under
 11 22 its qualified tuition program (currently $320,000 for Iowa).
 11 23    The bill provides other various terms and conditions for
 11 24 participation agreements, use and segregation of trust funds,
 11 25 cancellation of agreements and refund of account balances,
 11 26 and ownership rights in the trust.  The bill provides that an

 12  6 tax up to the maximum amount allowed per beneficiary per year
 12  7 for purposes of the Iowa educational savings plan trust in
 12  8 Code chapter 12D.  For 2015, that amount is set at $3,163.
 12  9 Any amounts refunded to a taxpayer from the cancellation of
 12 10 a participation agreement or that are withdrawn for purposes
 12 11 other than the payment of qualified disability expenses of the
 12 12 designated beneficiary must be included in Iowa net income to
 12 13 the extent they were previously deducted by the taxpayer or any
 12 14 other person as a contribution.  Third, income and earnings

 11 15 on behalf of a designated beneficiary.  The trust is required
 11 16 to maintain limits on the annual contributions to an account,
 11 17 and the aggregate balance in an account, matching those set
 11 18 forth in the federal ABLE program, which prohibits annual
 11 19 contributions to an account from exceeding the annual gift tax
 11 20 exclusion amount ($14,000 for 2015), and prohibits an aggregate

 12  7 for purposes of the Iowa educational savings plan trust in
 12  8 Code chapter 12D.  For 2015, that amount is set at $3,163.

 10 17    The trust is authorized to enter into participation
 10 18 agreements with individuals for the payment of future qualified
 10 19 disability expenses.  "Qualified disability expenses" means the
 10 20 same as defined under the federal ABLE program, which generally
 10 21 defines the term to include expenses related to a designated
 10 22 beneficiary's education, housing, transportation, employment
 10 23 training and support, assistive technology and personal support
 10 24 services, health, prevention and wellness, financial management
 10 25 and administrative services, legal fees, expenses for oversight
 10 26 and monitoring, funeral and burial expenses, and other expenses
 10 27 approved by the secretary of the United States treasury
 10 28 (secretary).
 10 29    The person with whom the state treasurer enters into a
 10 30 participation agreement must be both the account owner and
 10 31 designated beneficiary.  However, the bill allows a trustee
 10 32 or legal guardian to be designated as custodian of an account
 10 33 for a designated beneficiary who is a minor or who lacks
 10 34 capacity to enter into a participation agreement, provided such
 10 35 designation would be allowed under the federal ABLE program.
 11  1 "Designated beneficiary" is defined in the bill as a person
 11  2 who is a resident of Iowa and who qualifies as an eligible
 11  3 individual under the federal ABLE program, which includes
 11  4 individuals who are entitled to benefits based on blindness or
 11  5 disability under Title II (disability insurance) or Title XVI
 11  6 (supplemental security income) of the federal Social Security
 11  7 Act if such blindness or disability occurred before attaining
 11  8 26 years of age, and if such individual files a disability
 11  9 certification with the secretary.
 11 10    The bill requires the state treasurer to maintain a separate
 11 11 account in the trust for each designated beneficiary of a
 11 12 participation agreement.  Only one participation agreement
 11 13 shall be allowed per designated beneficiary.  Any person is
 11 14 allowed to make contributions in the form of cash to an account
 11 15 on behalf of a designated beneficiary.  The trust is required
 11 16 to maintain limits on the annual contributions to an account,
 11 17 and the aggregate balance in an account, matching those set
 11 18 forth in the federal ABLE program, which prohibits annual
 11 19 contributions to an account from exceeding the annual gift tax
 11 20 exclusion amount ($14,000 for 2015), and prohibits an aggregate
 11 21 account balance from exceeding the limit set by a state under
 11 22 its qualified tuition program (currently $320,000 for Iowa).
 11 23    The bill provides other various terms and conditions for
 11 24 participation agreements, use and segregation of trust funds,
 11 25 cancellation of agreements and refund of account balances,
 11 26 and ownership rights in the trust.  The bill provides that an
 11 27 account may be claimed by the Iowa Medicaid program upon the
 11 28 death of the designated beneficiary, in accordance with the
 11 29 federal ABLE program.  The bill requires the state treasurer to
 11 30 prepare and submit audited financial reports to the governor
 11 31 and general assembly, and further requires the state treasurer
 11 32 to comply with any reporting requirements of the federal ABLE
 11 33 program. The bill applies to qualified disability expenses
 11 34 incurred on or after July 1, 2015.
 11 35    IOWA TAX BENEFITS.  The bill provides several tax benefits
 12  1 under the trust.  First, the value of any interest in the trust
 12  2 of a decedent dying on or after July 1, 2015, is excluded
 12  3 from the Iowa inheritance tax.  Second, contributions to the
 12  4 trust made on or after July 1, 2015, on behalf of a designated
 12  5 beneficiary are deductible from the Iowa individual income
 12  6 tax up to the maximum amount allowed per beneficiary per year
 12  7 for purposes of the Iowa educational savings plan trust in
 12  8 Code chapter 12D.  For 2015, that amount is set at $3,163.
 12  9 Any amounts refunded to a taxpayer from the cancellation of

 10 35 designation would be allowed under the federal ABLE program.
 11  1 "Designated beneficiary" is defined in the bill as a person
 11  2 who is a resident of Iowa and who qualifies as an eligible
 11  3 individual under the federal ABLE program, which includes
 11  4 individuals who are entitled to benefits based on blindness or
 11  5 disability under Title II (disability insurance) or Title XVI
 11  6 (supplemental security income) of the federal Social Security
 11  7 Act if such blindness or disability occurred before attaining

 11  9 certification with the secretary.
 11 10    The bill requires the state treasurer to maintain a separate
 11 11 account in the trust for each designated beneficiary of a

 11 13 shall be allowed per designated beneficiary.  Any person is
 11 14 allowed to make contributions in the form of cash to an account
 11 15 on behalf of a designated beneficiary.  The trust is required
 11 16 to maintain limits on the annual contributions to an account,
 11 17 and the aggregate balance in an account, matching those set
 11 18 forth in the federal ABLE program, which prohibits annual
 11 19 contributions to an account from exceeding the annual gift tax
 11 20 exclusion amount ($14,000 for 2015), and prohibits an aggregate
 11 21 account balance from exceeding the limit set by a state under
 11 22 its qualified tuition program (currently $320,000 for Iowa).
 11 23    The bill provides other various terms and conditions for
 11 24 participation agreements, use and segregation of trust funds,
 11 25 cancellation of agreements and refund of account balances,
 11 26 and ownership rights in the trust.  The bill provides that an
 11 27 account may be claimed by the Iowa Medicaid program upon the
 11 28 death of the designated beneficiary, in accordance with the
 11 29 federal ABLE program.  The bill requires the state treasurer to
 11 30 prepare and submit audited financial reports to the governor
 11 31 and general assembly, and further requires the state treasurer
 11 32 to comply with any reporting requirements of the federal ABLE
 11 33 program. The bill applies to qualified disability expenses
 11 34 incurred on or after July 1, 2015.
 11 35    IOWA TAX BENEFITS.  The bill provides several tax benefits
 12  1 under the trust.  First, the value of any interest in the trust
 12  2 of a decedent dying on or after July 1, 2015, is excluded
 12  3 from the Iowa inheritance tax.  Second, contributions to the
 12  4 trust made on or after July 1, 2015, on behalf of a designated
 12  5 beneficiary are deductible from the Iowa individual income
 12  6 tax up to the maximum amount allowed per beneficiary per year
 12  7 for purposes of the Iowa educational savings plan trust in
 12  8 Code chapter 12D.  For 2015, that amount is set at $3,163.
 12  9 Any amounts refunded to a taxpayer from the cancellation of
 12 10 a participation agreement or that are withdrawn for purposes
 12 11 other than the payment of qualified disability expenses of the
 12 12 designated beneficiary must be included in Iowa net income to
 12 13 the extent they were previously deducted by the taxpayer or any
 12 14 other person as a contribution.  Third, income and earnings
 12 15 from the trust are exempt from the Iowa individual income tax.
 12 16 The individual income tax benefits apply retroactively to
 12 17 January 1, 2015, for tax years beginning on or after that date.
