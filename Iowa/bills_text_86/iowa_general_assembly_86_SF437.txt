  1 11 state who is required to be present at work for an employer
  1 12 during the four=hour period starting one hour prior to the time
  1 13 the precinct caucus starts is entitled to take unpaid leave for
  1 14 as much of that four=hour period as is necessary to participate

  1 22    2.  a.  An application by an employee for an absence may be
  1 23 denied by an employer if all the following circumstances exist:
  1 24    (1)  The person is employed in an emergency services position
  1 25 which shall include peace officer, fire fighter, emergency

  1 29 disruption due to the person's absence.
  1 30    (2)  The employer filed a written notice with the

  2  6 persons in that position needed by the employer to protect
  2  7 public health and safety or maintain minimum operational
  2  8 capacity, as applicable.
  2  9    b.  If the circumstances in paragraph "a" exist as to a

  2 27 to the number of hours taken to participate in the presidential
  2 28 precinct caucus as provided in subsection 1.  The option of
  2 29 working compensatory hours may be exercised individually by
  2 30 each employee.  Work performed during the compensatory hours
