  4  8                           EXPLANATION
  4  9 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  4 10 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  4 11    This bill establishes the safe routes to school program
  4 12 to be administered by the department of transportation, and
  4 13 establishes a safe routes to school fund in the state treasury
  4 14 under the authority of the department.
  4 15    The program is established to increase safety and
  4 16 convenience for school children walking or bicycling, to
  4 17 encourage school children to walk or bicycle to school, and to
  4 18 support safe routes to school projects in Iowa's communities.
  4 19 The goals of the program are to improve the public health and
  4 20 safety of children and communities by supporting and funding
  4 21 projects intended to reduce childhood obesity and to reduce
  4 22 student injuries and fatalities resulting from automobile
  4 23 collisions on school routes.
  4 24    The department is to maintain a coordinator for the
  4 25 program, and to provide outreach, education, and technical
  4 26 and application assistance to local communities and schools;
  4 27 develop a plan, in cooperation with the departments of
  4 28 education and public health, for implementation of the program;
  4 29 ensure the timely award and obligation of funds to safe routes
  4 30 to school projects; develop and periodically revise program
  4 31 guidelines; annually award 10 to 30 percent of the moneys in
  4 32 the fund for projects; and deposit in the fund at least 18
  4 33 percent of the moneys received by the department under the
  4 34 federal surface transportation block grant program of the
  4 35 federal Fixing America's Surface Transportation Act.
  5  1 Priority shall be given to providing technical assistance,
  5  2 resources, and funding to projects located in demonstrated
  5  3 high=need areas, including application preparation assistance,
  5  4 planning grants, and engineering consultation services.  The
  5  5 department must identify and take every reasonable measure to
  5  6 reduce barriers to the success of any project located in a
  5  7 designated high=need area.
  5  8    The bill defines "demonstrated high=need area" to mean
  5  9 either an area encompassing one or more school districts in
  5 10 which at least 50 percent of the children are eligible to
  5 11 receive free or reduced price meals under federal law, or a
  5 12 census tract in which the median household income is less than
  5 13 80 percent of the statewide average median.
  5 14    A "safe routes to school project" includes either an
  5 15 infrastructure project or a noninfrastructure project, or
  5 16 both.  An infrastructure project may include a planning or
  5 17 engineering project, and is a project located within two miles
  5 18 of a school that supports bicycling and walking to the school,
  5 19 such as sidewalk improvements, speed reduction improvements,
  5 20 pedestrian and bicycle crossing improvements, on=street bicycle
  5 21 facilities, off=street bicycle and pedestrian facilities,
  5 22 secure bicycle parking facilities, and traffic diversion or
  5 23 calming improvements.
  5 24    A noninfrastructure project is a project designed to
  5 25 encourage children to walk and bicycle to school, including
  5 26 public awareness campaigns and outreach to press and community
  5 27 leaders; traffic education and enforcement in the vicinity of a
  5 28 school; student education sessions on bicycle and pedestrian
  5 29 safety, health, and environment; and training for volunteers
  5 30 and managers.
  5 31    The fund consists of moneys available to and obtained or
  5 32 accepted by the department of transportation for the program,
  5 33 and the moneys in the fund are appropriated to the department
  5 34 for the program.
  5 35    Nothing in the bill shall be construed to limit, restrict,
  6  1 or otherwise discourage the allocation of federal or nonstate
  6  2 grants, gifts, or contracts for purposes of the safe routes to
  6  3 school program or safe routes to school projects.

  4 11    This bill establishes the safe routes to school program
  4 12 to be administered by the department of transportation, and
  4 13 establishes a safe routes to school fund in the state treasury
  4 14 under the authority of the department.
  4 15    The program is established to increase safety and
  4 16 convenience for school children walking or bicycling, to
  4 17 encourage school children to walk or bicycle to school, and to
  4 18 support safe routes to school projects in Iowa's communities.
  4 19 The goals of the program are to improve the public health and
  4 20 safety of children and communities by supporting and funding
  4 21 projects intended to reduce childhood obesity and to reduce
  4 22 student injuries and fatalities resulting from automobile
  4 23 collisions on school routes.
  4 24    The department is to maintain a coordinator for the
  4 25 program, and to provide outreach, education, and technical
  4 26 and application assistance to local communities and schools;
  4 27 develop a plan, in cooperation with the departments of
  4 28 education and public health, for implementation of the program;
  4 29 ensure the timely award and obligation of funds to safe routes
  4 30 to school projects; develop and periodically revise program
  4 31 guidelines; annually award 10 to 30 percent of the moneys in
  4 32 the fund for projects; and deposit in the fund at least 18
  4 33 percent of the moneys received by the department under the
  4 34 federal surface transportation block grant program of the
  4 35 federal Fixing America's Surface Transportation Act.
  5  1 Priority shall be given to providing technical assistance,
  5  2 resources, and funding to projects located in demonstrated
  5  3 high=need areas, including application preparation assistance,
  5  4 planning grants, and engineering consultation services.  The
  5  5 department must identify and take every reasonable measure to
  5  6 reduce barriers to the success of any project located in a
  5  7 designated high=need area.
  5  8    The bill defines "demonstrated high=need area" to mean
  5  9 either an area encompassing one or more school districts in
  5 10 which at least 50 percent of the children are eligible to
  5 11 receive free or reduced price meals under federal law, or a
  5 12 census tract in which the median household income is less than
  5 13 80 percent of the statewide average median.
  5 14    A "safe routes to school project" includes either an
  5 15 infrastructure project or a noninfrastructure project, or
  5 16 both.  An infrastructure project may include a planning or
  5 17 engineering project, and is a project located within two miles
  5 18 of a school that supports bicycling and walking to the school,
  5 19 such as sidewalk improvements, speed reduction improvements,
  5 20 pedestrian and bicycle crossing improvements, on=street bicycle
  5 21 facilities, off=street bicycle and pedestrian facilities,
  5 22 secure bicycle parking facilities, and traffic diversion or
  5 23 calming improvements.
  5 24    A noninfrastructure project is a project designed to
  5 25 encourage children to walk and bicycle to school, including
  5 26 public awareness campaigns and outreach to press and community
  5 27 leaders; traffic education and enforcement in the vicinity of a
