  2 20                           EXPLANATION
  2 21 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  2 22 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  2 23    Current Code section 427.1(23) provides a property tax
  2 24 exemption for land designated as native prairie or land
  2 25 designated as a protected wetland by the department of natural
  2 26 resources if the property is not used for economic gain.
  2 27 This bill specifies that the receipt of payments under the
  2 28 federal wetlands reserve program or the federal agricultural
  2 29 conservation easement program shall not be considered a use for
  2 30 economic gain.
  2 31    Code section 25B.7 provides that for a property tax credit
  2 32 or exemption enacted on or after January 1, 1997, if a state
  2 33 appropriation made to fund the credit or exemption is not
  2 34 sufficient to fully fund the credit or exemption, the political
  2 35 subdivision shall be required to extend to the taxpayer only
  3  1 that portion of the credit or exemption estimated by the
  3  2 department of revenue to be funded by the state appropriation.
  3  3 Code section 25B.7 does not apply to the bill insofar as state
  3  4 reimbursement for lost tax revenue from exempted protected
