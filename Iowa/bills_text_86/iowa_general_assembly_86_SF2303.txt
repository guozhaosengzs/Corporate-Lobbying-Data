  5  4    Sec. 10.  EFFECTIVE UPON ENACTMENT.  The sections of this
  5  5 division of this Act rescinding Iowa administrative code rules
  5  6 and amendments to Iowa administrative code rules, being deemed
  5  7 of immediate importance, take effect upon enactment.
  5  8                           EXPLANATION
  5  9 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  5 10 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  5 11    This bill relates to state taxation.
  5 12    DIVISION I ==== INTERNAL REVENUE CODE REFERENCES.  The bill
  5 13 provides that notwithstanding several Code provisions as
  5 14 specified in the bill, the definitions of "Internal Revenue
  5 15 Code" in those Code provisions and, by internal reference,
  5 16 in other sections of the Iowa Code and Iowa Acts shall mean
  5 17 the Internal Revenue Code in effect on, or as amended to and
  5 18 including, January 1, 2016.  This definition change applies
  5 19 only to the period beginning January 1, 2015, and ending
  5 20 December 31, 2015, and for tax years beginning during the 2015
  5 21 calendar year.
  5 22    The affected Code provisions include Code sections 422.3
  5 23 and 422.32, general definition sections in the chapter of the
  5 24 Code that governs corporate and individual income tax and the
  5 25 franchise tax, and Code sections 15.335, 422.10, and 422.33,
  5 26 which contain references to the Internal Revenue Code for the
  5 27 state research activities credit for individuals, corporations,
  5 28 and corporations in economic development areas.
  5 29    Code section 422.9 provides individuals a deduction from
  5 30 net income for state sales and use taxes if the individual
  5 31 chose to deduct sales and use tax in lieu of state income taxes
  5 32 or the standard deduction for federal income tax purposes.
  5 33 This deduction was set to expire under both federal and Iowa
  5 34 law for tax years beginning on or after January 1, 2015.  The
  5 35 federal Protecting Americans from Tax Hikes Act of 2015 made
  6  1 the federal deduction permanent.  The bill allows the Iowa
  6  2 deduction for tax years beginning during the 2015 calendar
  6  3 year.
  6  4    The bill decouples, for Iowa income tax purposes for tax
  6  5 years ending on or after January 1, 2015, but before January
  6  6 1, 2016, from the federal additional first=year depreciation
  6  7 allowance in section 168(k) of the Internal Revenue Code
  6  8 (bonus depreciation) which was modified and extended through
  6  9 2019 by the federal Protecting Americans from Tax Hikes Act
  6 10 of 2015.  Taxpayers who claim bonus depreciation for federal
  6 11 tax purposes are, for the applicable tax year, required to add
  6 12 such depreciation amounts back to Iowa net income, but are
  6 13 then allowed under existing state law to deduct the amount of
  6 14 depreciation that would otherwise be allowable under federal
  6 15 law, without regard to the bonus depreciation allowance.
  6 16    Under current law, taxpayers are in some instances required,
  6 17 when calculating alternative minimum tax under Code section
  6 18 422.5(2) and itemized deductions under Code section 422.9(2),
  6 19 to recompute their federal adjusted gross income to take
  6 20 into account the fact that Iowa has decoupled from bonus
  6 21 depreciation.  The bill provides that taxpayers must make those
  6 22 same adjustments to federal adjusted gross income for tax year
  6 23 2015 to account for the fact that Iowa has decoupled from bonus
  6 24 depreciation as described above.
  6 25    The division takes effect upon enactment and applies
  6 26 retroactively to January 1, 2015.
  6 27    DIVISION II ==== SALES AND USE TAXES.  The bill rescinds
  6 28 several administrative rules and amendments to administrative
  6 29 rules of the department of revenue relating to the
  6 30 manufacturing sales and use tax exemptions under Code sections
  6 31 423.3(47) and 423.3(48) for the purchase of certain items used
  6 32 in manufacturing, research and development, data processing
  6 33 or storage, or recycling activities, and for the purchase of
  6 34 certain design and installation services related to machinery
  6 35 and equipment, and to the definitions of several applicable
  7  1 terms, including but not limited to definitions for tax=exempt
  7  2 "computers", "machinery", "equipment", "replacement parts",
  7  3 and "materials used to construct or self=construct computers,
  7  4 machinery, and equipment".  These administrative rules and
  7  5 amendments to administrative rules also concern the treatment
  7  6 of these tax=exempt items as they relate to the taxation of
  7  7 construction activities under Code sections 423.2(1)(b) and
  7  8 423.2(1)(c) by amending the method for determining whether
  7  9 the items are considered real property and taxed as building
  7 10 materials when purchased in furtherance of a construction
  7 11 contract, or considered tangible personal property eligible for
  7 12 the manufacturing sales and use tax exemptions.
  7 13    The effect of rescinding the amendments to these
  7 14 administrative rules is to restore the language of the
  7 15 affected rules to that as it existed prior to the date
  7 16 the adopted amendments to the rules were published in the
  7 17 Iowa administrative bulletin.  The bill directs the Iowa
  7 18 administrative code editor to restore the text of the affected
  7 19 rules to the language that existed on January 5, 2016, which
  7 20 was the day before the amendments were published in the
  7 21 Iowa administrative bulletin.  The bill also directs the
  7 22 Iowa administrative code editor to remove language of the
  7 23 rescinded rules from the Iowa administrative code. The Iowa
  7 24 administrative code editor is required to complete these
  7 25 actions as soon as practicable.  The provisions rescinding
  7 26 these administrative rules and amendments to administrative

  7 30 423.3(47) for the purchase or rental of certain items used in
  7 31 manufacturing, research and development, data processing or
  7 32 storage, or recycling activities.
  7 33    Under current law, the exemption includes replacement
  7 34 parts. The bill amends the exemption to include materials
  7 35 used to construct or self=construct replacement parts. The
  8  1 bill defines "replacement part" for purposes of the exemption
  8  2 to mean tangible personal property other than computers,
  8  3 machinery, equipment, or supplies, regardless of the cost or
  8  4 useful life of the property, that replaces a component of a
  8  5 computer, machinery, or equipment, performs the same or similar
  8  6 function as that component, and restores or improves the
  8  7 computer, machinery, or equipment.
  8  8    The bill also amends the exemption to include supplies
  8  9 and materials used to construct or self=construct supplies.
  8 10 "Supplies" is defined in the bill as tangible personal property
  8 11 that is not a computer, machinery, equipment, or replacement
  8 12 part and that meets one of the following four conditions:
  8 13    1.  The tangible personal property is to be connected to
  8 14 a computer, machinery, or equipment and requires regular
  8 15 replacement because it is consumed or deteriorates during use.
  8 16 The bill lists saw blades, drill bits, filters, and other
  8 17 similar items with a short useful life as examples.
  8 18    2.  The tangible personal property is used in conjunction
  8 19 with a computer, machinery, or equipment and is specially
  8 20 designed for use in manufacturing specific products and may
  8 21 be used interchangeably and intermittently on a particular
  8 22 computer, machine, or piece of equipment.  The bill lists jigs,
  8 23 dies, tools, and other similar items as examples.
  8 24    3.  The tangible personal property comes into physical
  8 25 contact with other tangible personal property used in
  8 26 processing and is used to assist with or maintain conditions
  8 27 necessary for processing.  The bill lists cutting fluids, oils,
  8 28 coolants, lubricants, and other similar items with a short
  8 29 useful life as examples.

  8 31 in an activity described in Code section 423.3(47)(a)(1)=(6).
  8 32 The bill lists prototype materials and testing materials as
  8 33 examples.
  8 34    By operation of Code section 423.6, an item exempt from the

  5  4    Sec. 10.  EFFECTIVE UPON ENACTMENT.  The sections of this
  5  5 division of this Act rescinding Iowa administrative code rules
  5  6 and amendments to Iowa administrative code rules, being deemed
  5  7 of immediate importance, take effect upon enactment.
  5  8                           EXPLANATION
  5  9 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  5 10 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  5 11    This bill relates to state taxation.
  5 12    DIVISION I ==== INTERNAL REVENUE CODE REFERENCES.  The bill
  5 13 provides that notwithstanding several Code provisions as
  5 14 specified in the bill, the definitions of "Internal Revenue
  5 15 Code" in those Code provisions and, by internal reference,
  5 16 in other sections of the Iowa Code and Iowa Acts shall mean
  5 17 the Internal Revenue Code in effect on, or as amended to and
  5 18 including, January 1, 2016.  This definition change applies
  5 19 only to the period beginning January 1, 2015, and ending
  5 20 December 31, 2015, and for tax years beginning during the 2015
  5 21 calendar year.
  5 22    The affected Code provisions include Code sections 422.3
  5 23 and 422.32, general definition sections in the chapter of the
  5 24 Code that governs corporate and individual income tax and the
  5 25 franchise tax, and Code sections 15.335, 422.10, and 422.33,
  5 26 which contain references to the Internal Revenue Code for the
  5 27 state research activities credit for individuals, corporations,
  5 28 and corporations in economic development areas.
  5 29    Code section 422.9 provides individuals a deduction from
  5 30 net income for state sales and use taxes if the individual
  5 31 chose to deduct sales and use tax in lieu of state income taxes
  5 32 or the standard deduction for federal income tax purposes.
  5 33 This deduction was set to expire under both federal and Iowa
  5 34 law for tax years beginning on or after January 1, 2015.  The
  5 35 federal Protecting Americans from Tax Hikes Act of 2015 made
  6  1 the federal deduction permanent.  The bill allows the Iowa
  6  2 deduction for tax years beginning during the 2015 calendar
  6  3 year.
  6  4    The bill decouples, for Iowa income tax purposes for tax
  6  5 years ending on or after January 1, 2015, but before January
  6  6 1, 2016, from the federal additional first=year depreciation
  6  7 allowance in section 168(k) of the Internal Revenue Code
  6  8 (bonus depreciation) which was modified and extended through
  6  9 2019 by the federal Protecting Americans from Tax Hikes Act
  6 10 of 2015.  Taxpayers who claim bonus depreciation for federal
  6 11 tax purposes are, for the applicable tax year, required to add
  6 12 such depreciation amounts back to Iowa net income, but are
  6 13 then allowed under existing state law to deduct the amount of
  6 14 depreciation that would otherwise be allowable under federal
  6 15 law, without regard to the bonus depreciation allowance.
  6 16    Under current law, taxpayers are in some instances required,
  6 17 when calculating alternative minimum tax under Code section
  6 18 422.5(2) and itemized deductions under Code section 422.9(2),
  6 19 to recompute their federal adjusted gross income to take
  6 20 into account the fact that Iowa has decoupled from bonus
  6 21 depreciation.  The bill provides that taxpayers must make those
  6 22 same adjustments to federal adjusted gross income for tax year
  6 23 2015 to account for the fact that Iowa has decoupled from bonus
  6 24 depreciation as described above.
  6 25    The division takes effect upon enactment and applies
  6 26 retroactively to January 1, 2015.
  6 27    DIVISION II ==== SALES AND USE TAXES.  The bill rescinds
  6 28 several administrative rules and amendments to administrative
  6 29 rules of the department of revenue relating to the
  6 30 manufacturing sales and use tax exemptions under Code sections
  6 31 423.3(47) and 423.3(48) for the purchase of certain items used
  6 32 in manufacturing, research and development, data processing
  6 33 or storage, or recycling activities, and for the purchase of
  6 34 certain design and installation services related to machinery
  6 35 and equipment, and to the definitions of several applicable
  7  1 terms, including but not limited to definitions for tax=exempt
  7  2 "computers", "machinery", "equipment", "replacement parts",
  7  3 and "materials used to construct or self=construct computers,
  7  4 machinery, and equipment".  These administrative rules and
  7  5 amendments to administrative rules also concern the treatment
  7  6 of these tax=exempt items as they relate to the taxation of
  7  7 construction activities under Code sections 423.2(1)(b) and
  7  8 423.2(1)(c) by amending the method for determining whether
  7  9 the items are considered real property and taxed as building
  7 10 materials when purchased in furtherance of a construction
  7 11 contract, or considered tangible personal property eligible for
  7 12 the manufacturing sales and use tax exemptions.
  7 13    The effect of rescinding the amendments to these
  7 14 administrative rules is to restore the language of the
  7 15 affected rules to that as it existed prior to the date
  7 16 the adopted amendments to the rules were published in the
  7 17 Iowa administrative bulletin.  The bill directs the Iowa
  7 18 administrative code editor to restore the text of the affected
  7 19 rules to the language that existed on January 5, 2016, which
  7 20 was the day before the amendments were published in the
  7 21 Iowa administrative bulletin.  The bill also directs the
  7 22 Iowa administrative code editor to remove language of the
  7 23 rescinded rules from the Iowa administrative code. The Iowa
  7 24 administrative code editor is required to complete these
  7 25 actions as soon as practicable.  The provisions rescinding
  7 26 these administrative rules and amendments to administrative
  7 27 rules and requiring certain administrative code editor actions
  7 28 take effect upon enactment.
  7 29    The bill amends the sales tax exemption in Code section
  7 30 423.3(47) for the purchase or rental of certain items used in
  7 31 manufacturing, research and development, data processing or
  7 32 storage, or recycling activities.
  7 33    Under current law, the exemption includes replacement
  7 34 parts. The bill amends the exemption to include materials
  7 35 used to construct or self=construct replacement parts. The
  8  1 bill defines "replacement part" for purposes of the exemption
  8  2 to mean tangible personal property other than computers,
  8  3 machinery, equipment, or supplies, regardless of the cost or
  8  4 useful life of the property, that replaces a component of a
  8  5 computer, machinery, or equipment, performs the same or similar
  8  6 function as that component, and restores or improves the
  8  7 computer, machinery, or equipment.
  8  8    The bill also amends the exemption to include supplies
  8  9 and materials used to construct or self=construct supplies.
  8 10 "Supplies" is defined in the bill as tangible personal property
  8 11 that is not a computer, machinery, equipment, or replacement
  8 12 part and that meets one of the following four conditions:
  8 13    1.  The tangible personal property is to be connected to
  8 14 a computer, machinery, or equipment and requires regular
  8 15 replacement because it is consumed or deteriorates during use.
  8 16 The bill lists saw blades, drill bits, filters, and other
  8 17 similar items with a short useful life as examples.
  8 18    2.  The tangible personal property is used in conjunction
  8 19 with a computer, machinery, or equipment and is specially
  8 20 designed for use in manufacturing specific products and may
  8 21 be used interchangeably and intermittently on a particular
  8 22 computer, machine, or piece of equipment.  The bill lists jigs,
  8 23 dies, tools, and other similar items as examples.
  8 24    3.  The tangible personal property comes into physical
  8 25 contact with other tangible personal property used in
  8 26 processing and is used to assist with or maintain conditions
  8 27 necessary for processing.  The bill lists cutting fluids, oils,
  8 28 coolants, lubricants, and other similar items with a short
  8 29 useful life as examples.
  8 30    4. The tangible property is directly and primarily used
  8 31 in an activity described in Code section 423.3(47)(a)(1)=(6).
  8 32 The bill lists prototype materials and testing materials as
  8 33 examples.
  8 34    By operation of Code section 423.6, an item exempt from the
  8 35 imposition of the sales tax is also exempt from the use tax
  9  1 imposed in Code section 423.5.>

  5  8                           EXPLANATION
  5  9 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  5 10 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  5 11    This bill relates to state taxation.
  5 12    DIVISION I ==== INTERNAL REVENUE CODE REFERENCES.  The bill
  5 13 provides that notwithstanding several Code provisions as
  5 14 specified in the bill, the definitions of "Internal Revenue
  5 15 Code" in those Code provisions and, by internal reference,
  5 16 in other sections of the Iowa Code and Iowa Acts shall mean
  5 17 the Internal Revenue Code in effect on, or as amended to and
  5 18 including, January 1, 2016.  This definition change applies
  5 19 only to the period beginning January 1, 2015, and ending
  5 20 December 31, 2015, and for tax years beginning during the 2015
  5 21 calendar year.
  5 22    The affected Code provisions include Code sections 422.3
  5 23 and 422.32, general definition sections in the chapter of the
  5 24 Code that governs corporate and individual income tax and the
  5 25 franchise tax, and Code sections 15.335, 422.10, and 422.33,
  5 26 which contain references to the Internal Revenue Code for the
  5 27 state research activities credit for individuals, corporations,
  5 28 and corporations in economic development areas.
  5 29    Code section 422.9 provides individuals a deduction from
  5 30 net income for state sales and use taxes if the individual
  5 31 chose to deduct sales and use tax in lieu of state income taxes
  5 32 or the standard deduction for federal income tax purposes.
  5 33 This deduction was set to expire under both federal and Iowa
  5 34 law for tax years beginning on or after January 1, 2015.  The
  5 35 federal Protecting Americans from Tax Hikes Act of 2015 made
  6  1 the federal deduction permanent.  The bill allows the Iowa
  6  2 deduction for tax years beginning during the 2015 calendar
  6  3 year.
  6  4    The bill decouples, for Iowa income tax purposes for tax
  6  5 years ending on or after January 1, 2015, but before January
  6  6 1, 2016, from the federal additional first=year depreciation
  6  7 allowance in section 168(k) of the Internal Revenue Code
  6  8 (bonus depreciation) which was modified and extended through
  6  9 2019 by the federal Protecting Americans from Tax Hikes Act
  6 10 of 2015.  Taxpayers who claim bonus depreciation for federal
  6 11 tax purposes are, for the applicable tax year, required to add
  6 12 such depreciation amounts back to Iowa net income, but are
  6 13 then allowed under existing state law to deduct the amount of
  6 14 depreciation that would otherwise be allowable under federal
  6 15 law, without regard to the bonus depreciation allowance.
  6 16    Under current law, taxpayers are in some instances required,
  6 17 when calculating alternative minimum tax under Code section
  6 18 422.5(2) and itemized deductions under Code section 422.9(2),
  6 19 to recompute their federal adjusted gross income to take
  6 20 into account the fact that Iowa has decoupled from bonus
  6 21 depreciation.  The bill provides that taxpayers must make those
  6 22 same adjustments to federal adjusted gross income for tax year
  6 23 2015 to account for the fact that Iowa has decoupled from bonus
  6 24 depreciation as described above.
  6 25    The division takes effect upon enactment and applies
  6 26 retroactively to January 1, 2015.
  6 27    DIVISION II ==== SALES AND USE TAXES.  The bill rescinds
  6 28 several administrative rules and amendments to administrative
  6 29 rules of the department of revenue relating to the
  6 30 manufacturing sales and use tax exemptions under Code sections
  6 31 423.3(47) and 423.3(48) for the purchase of certain items used

  7  2 "computers", "machinery", "equipment", "replacement parts",
  7  3 and "materials used to construct or self=construct computers,
  7  4 machinery, and equipment".  These administrative rules and
  7  5 amendments to administrative rules also concern the treatment
  7  6 of these tax=exempt items as they relate to the taxation of
  7  7 construction activities under Code sections 423.2(1)(b) and
  7  8 423.2(1)(c) by amending the method for determining whether
  7  9 the items are considered real property and taxed as building
  7 10 materials when purchased in furtherance of a construction
  7 11 contract, or considered tangible personal property eligible for
  7 12 the manufacturing sales and use tax exemptions.

  7 33    Under current law, the exemption includes replacement
  7 34 parts. The bill amends the exemption to include materials
  7 35 used to construct or self=construct replacement parts. The

  5 24 Code that governs corporate and individual income tax and the
  5 25 franchise tax, and Code sections 15.335, 422.10, and 422.33,
  5 26 which contain references to the Internal Revenue Code for the
  5 27 state research activities credit for individuals, corporations,
  5 28 and corporations in economic development areas.
  5 29    Code section 422.9 provides individuals a deduction from
  5 30 net income for state sales and use taxes if the individual
  5 31 chose to deduct sales and use tax in lieu of state income taxes
  5 32 or the standard deduction for federal income tax purposes.
  5 33 This deduction was set to expire under both federal and Iowa
  5 34 law for tax years beginning on or after January 1, 2015.  The
  5 35 federal Protecting Americans from Tax Hikes Act of 2015 made
  6  1 the federal deduction permanent.  The bill allows the Iowa
  6  2 deduction for tax years beginning during the 2015 calendar
  6  3 year.
  6  4    The bill decouples, for Iowa income tax purposes for tax
  6  5 years ending on or after January 1, 2015, but before January
  6  6 1, 2016, from the federal additional first=year depreciation
  6  7 allowance in section 168(k) of the Internal Revenue Code
  6  8 (bonus depreciation) which was modified and extended through
  6  9 2019 by the federal Protecting Americans from Tax Hikes Act
  6 10 of 2015.  Taxpayers who claim bonus depreciation for federal
  6 11 tax purposes are, for the applicable tax year, required to add
  6 12 such depreciation amounts back to Iowa net income, but are
  6 13 then allowed under existing state law to deduct the amount of
  6 14 depreciation that would otherwise be allowable under federal
  6 15 law, without regard to the bonus depreciation allowance.
  6 16    Under current law, taxpayers are in some instances required,
  6 17 when calculating alternative minimum tax under Code section
  6 18 422.5(2) and itemized deductions under Code section 422.9(2),
  6 19 to recompute their federal adjusted gross income to take
  6 20 into account the fact that Iowa has decoupled from bonus
  6 21 depreciation.  The bill provides that taxpayers must make those
  6 22 same adjustments to federal adjusted gross income for tax year
  6 23 2015 to account for the fact that Iowa has decoupled from bonus
  6 24 depreciation as described above.
  6 25    The division takes effect upon enactment and applies
  6 26 retroactively to January 1, 2015.
  6 27    DIVISION II ==== SALES AND USE TAXES.  The bill rescinds
  6 28 several administrative rules and amendments to administrative
  6 29 rules of the department of revenue relating to the
  6 30 manufacturing sales and use tax exemptions under Code sections
  6 31 423.3(47) and 423.3(48) for the purchase of certain items used
  6 32 in manufacturing, research and development, data processing
  6 33 or storage, or recycling activities, and for the purchase of
  6 34 certain design and installation services related to machinery
  6 35 and equipment, and to the definitions of several applicable
  7  1 terms, including but not limited to definitions for tax=exempt
  7  2 "computers", "machinery", "equipment", "replacement parts",
  7  3 and "materials used to construct or self=construct computers,
  7  4 machinery, and equipment".  These administrative rules and
  7  5 amendments to administrative rules also concern the treatment
  7  6 of these tax=exempt items as they relate to the taxation of
  7  7 construction activities under Code sections 423.2(1)(b) and
  7  8 423.2(1)(c) by amending the method for determining whether
  7  9 the items are considered real property and taxed as building
  7 10 materials when purchased in furtherance of a construction
  7 11 contract, or considered tangible personal property eligible for
  7 12 the manufacturing sales and use tax exemptions.
  7 13    The effect of rescinding the amendments to these
  7 14 administrative rules is to restore the language of the
  7 15 affected rules to that as it existed prior to the date
  7 16 the adopted amendments to the rules were published in the
  7 17 Iowa administrative bulletin.  The bill directs the Iowa
  7 18 administrative code editor to restore the text of the affected
  7 19 rules to the language that existed on January 5, 2016, which
  7 20 was the day before the amendments were published in the
  7 21 Iowa administrative bulletin.  The bill also directs the
  7 22 Iowa administrative code editor to remove language of the
  7 23 rescinded rules from the Iowa administrative code. The Iowa
  7 24 administrative code editor is required to complete these
  7 25 actions as soon as practicable.  The provisions rescinding
  7 26 these administrative rules and amendments to administrative
  7 27 rules and requiring certain administrative code editor actions
  7 28 take effect upon enactment.
  7 29    The bill amends the sales tax exemption in Code section
  7 30 423.3(47) for the purchase or rental of certain items used in
  7 31 manufacturing, research and development, data processing or
  7 32 storage, or recycling activities.
  7 33    Under current law, the exemption includes replacement
  7 34 parts. The bill amends the exemption to include materials
  7 35 used to construct or self=construct replacement parts. The
  8  1 bill defines "replacement part" for purposes of the exemption
  8  2 to mean tangible personal property other than computers,
  8  3 machinery, equipment, or supplies, regardless of the cost or
  8  4 useful life of the property, that replaces a component of a
  8  5 computer, machinery, or equipment, performs the same or similar
  8  6 function as that component, and restores or improves the
  8  7 computer, machinery, or equipment.
  8  8    The bill also amends the exemption to include supplies
  8  9 and materials used to construct or self=construct supplies.
  8 10 "Supplies" is defined in the bill as tangible personal property
  8 11 that is not a computer, machinery, equipment, or replacement
  8 12 part and that meets one of the following four conditions:
  8 13    1.  The tangible personal property is to be connected to
  8 14 a computer, machinery, or equipment and requires regular
  8 15 replacement because it is consumed or deteriorates during use.
  8 16 The bill lists saw blades, drill bits, filters, and other
  8 17 similar items with a short useful life as examples.
  8 18    2.  The tangible personal property is used in conjunction
  8 19 with a computer, machinery, or equipment and is specially
  8 20 designed for use in manufacturing specific products and may
  8 21 be used interchangeably and intermittently on a particular
  8 22 computer, machine, or piece of equipment.  The bill lists jigs,
  8 23 dies, tools, and other similar items as examples.
  8 24    3.  The tangible personal property comes into physical
  8 25 contact with other tangible personal property used in
  8 26 processing and is used to assist with or maintain conditions
  8 27 necessary for processing.  The bill lists cutting fluids, oils,
  8 28 coolants, lubricants, and other similar items with a short
  8 29 useful life as examples.
  8 30    4. The tangible property is directly and primarily used
  8 31 in an activity described in Code section 423.3(47)(a)(1)=(6).
  8 32 The bill lists prototype materials and testing materials as
  8 33 examples.
  8 34    By operation of Code section 423.6, an item exempt from the
  8 35 imposition of the sales tax is also exempt from the use tax
  9  1 imposed in Code section 423.5.>

  5  5 division of this Act rescinding Iowa administrative code rules
  5  6 and amendments to Iowa administrative code rules, being deemed
  5  7 of immediate importance, take effect upon enactment.
  5  8                           EXPLANATION
  5  9 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  5 10 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  5 11    This bill relates to state taxation.
  5 12    DIVISION I ==== INTERNAL REVENUE CODE REFERENCES.  The bill
  5 13 provides that notwithstanding several Code provisions as
  5 14 specified in the bill, the definitions of "Internal Revenue
  5 15 Code" in those Code provisions and, by internal reference,
  5 16 in other sections of the Iowa Code and Iowa Acts shall mean
  5 17 the Internal Revenue Code in effect on, or as amended to and
  5 18 including, January 1, 2016.  This definition change applies
  5 19 only to the period beginning January 1, 2015, and ending
  5 20 December 31, 2015, and for tax years beginning during the 2015
  5 21 calendar year.
  5 22    The affected Code provisions include Code sections 422.3
  5 23 and 422.32, general definition sections in the chapter of the
  5 24 Code that governs corporate and individual income tax and the
  5 25 franchise tax, and Code sections 15.335, 422.10, and 422.33,
  5 26 which contain references to the Internal Revenue Code for the
  5 27 state research activities credit for individuals, corporations,
  5 28 and corporations in economic development areas.
  5 29    Code section 422.9 provides individuals a deduction from
  5 30 net income for state sales and use taxes if the individual
  5 31 chose to deduct sales and use tax in lieu of state income taxes
  5 32 or the standard deduction for federal income tax purposes.
  5 33 This deduction was set to expire under both federal and Iowa
  5 34 law for tax years beginning on or after January 1, 2015.  The
  5 35 federal Protecting Americans from Tax Hikes Act of 2015 made
  6  1 the federal deduction permanent.  The bill allows the Iowa
  6  2 deduction for tax years beginning during the 2015 calendar
  6  3 year.
  6  4    The bill decouples, for Iowa income tax purposes for tax
  6  5 years ending on or after January 1, 2015, but before January
  6  6 1, 2016, from the federal additional first=year depreciation
  6  7 allowance in section 168(k) of the Internal Revenue Code
  6  8 (bonus depreciation) which was modified and extended through
  6  9 2019 by the federal Protecting Americans from Tax Hikes Act
  6 10 of 2015.  Taxpayers who claim bonus depreciation for federal
  6 11 tax purposes are, for the applicable tax year, required to add
  6 12 such depreciation amounts back to Iowa net income, but are
  6 13 then allowed under existing state law to deduct the amount of
  6 14 depreciation that would otherwise be allowable under federal
  6 15 law, without regard to the bonus depreciation allowance.
  6 16    Under current law, taxpayers are in some instances required,
  6 17 when calculating alternative minimum tax under Code section
  6 18 422.5(2) and itemized deductions under Code section 422.9(2),
  6 19 to recompute their federal adjusted gross income to take
  6 20 into account the fact that Iowa has decoupled from bonus
  6 21 depreciation.  The bill provides that taxpayers must make those
  6 22 same adjustments to federal adjusted gross income for tax year
  6 23 2015 to account for the fact that Iowa has decoupled from bonus
  6 24 depreciation as described above.
  6 25    The division takes effect upon enactment and applies
  6 26 retroactively to January 1, 2015.
  6 27    DIVISION II ==== SALES AND USE TAXES.  The bill rescinds
  6 28 several administrative rules and amendments to administrative
  6 29 rules of the department of revenue relating to the
  6 30 manufacturing sales and use tax exemptions under Code sections
  6 31 423.3(47) and 423.3(48) for the purchase of certain items used
  6 32 in manufacturing, research and development, data processing
  6 33 or storage, or recycling activities, and for the purchase of
  6 34 certain design and installation services related to machinery
  6 35 and equipment, and to the definitions of several applicable
  7  1 terms, including but not limited to definitions for tax=exempt
  7  2 "computers", "machinery", "equipment", "replacement parts",
  7  3 and "materials used to construct or self=construct computers,
  7  4 machinery, and equipment".  These administrative rules and
  7  5 amendments to administrative rules also concern the treatment
  7  6 of these tax=exempt items as they relate to the taxation of
  7  7 construction activities under Code sections 423.2(1)(b) and
  7  8 423.2(1)(c) by amending the method for determining whether
  7  9 the items are considered real property and taxed as building
  7 10 materials when purchased in furtherance of a construction
  7 11 contract, or considered tangible personal property eligible for
  7 12 the manufacturing sales and use tax exemptions.
  7 13    The effect of rescinding the amendments to these
  7 14 administrative rules is to restore the language of the
  7 15 affected rules to that as it existed prior to the date
  7 16 the adopted amendments to the rules were published in the

  7 22 Iowa administrative code editor to remove language of the
  7 23 rescinded rules from the Iowa administrative code. The Iowa
  7 24 administrative code editor is required to complete these

  7 29    The bill amends the sales tax exemption in Code section
  7 30 423.3(47) for the purchase or rental of certain items used in
  7 31 manufacturing, research and development, data processing or

  7 33    Under current law, the exemption includes replacement
  7 34 parts. The bill amends the exemption to include materials
  7 35 used to construct or self=construct replacement parts. The
  8  1 bill defines "replacement part" for purposes of the exemption
  8  2 to mean tangible personal property other than computers,
  8  3 machinery, equipment, or supplies, regardless of the cost or
  8  4 useful life of the property, that replaces a component of a
  8  5 computer, machinery, or equipment, performs the same or similar
  8  6 function as that component, and restores or improves the
  8  7 computer, machinery, or equipment.
  8  8    The bill also amends the exemption to include supplies
  8  9 and materials used to construct or self=construct supplies.

  7  2 "computers", "machinery", "equipment", "replacement parts",
  7  3 and "materials used to construct or self=construct computers,

  7  5 amendments to administrative rules also concern the treatment
  7  6 of these tax=exempt items as they relate to the taxation of
  7  7 construction activities under Code sections 423.2(1)(b) and
  7  8 423.2(1)(c) by amending the method for determining whether
  7  9 the items are considered real property and taxed as building
  7 10 materials when purchased in furtherance of a construction
  7 11 contract, or considered tangible personal property eligible for
  7 12 the manufacturing sales and use tax exemptions.
  7 13    The effect of rescinding the amendments to these
  7 14 administrative rules is to restore the language of the
  7 15 affected rules to that as it existed prior to the date
  7 16 the adopted amendments to the rules were published in the

  5  7 of immediate importance, take effect upon enactment.
  5  8                           EXPLANATION
  5  9 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  5 10 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  5 11    This bill relates to state taxation.
  5 12    DIVISION I ==== INTERNAL REVENUE CODE REFERENCES.  The bill
  5 13 provides that notwithstanding several Code provisions as
  5 14 specified in the bill, the definitions of "Internal Revenue
  5 15 Code" in those Code provisions and, by internal reference,
  5 16 in other sections of the Iowa Code and Iowa Acts shall mean
  5 17 the Internal Revenue Code in effect on, or as amended to and
  5 18 including, January 1, 2016.  This definition change applies
  5 19 only to the period beginning January 1, 2015, and ending
  5 20 December 31, 2015, and for tax years beginning during the 2015
  5 21 calendar year.
  5 22    The affected Code provisions include Code sections 422.3
  5 23 and 422.32, general definition sections in the chapter of the
  5 24 Code that governs corporate and individual income tax and the
  5 25 franchise tax, and Code sections 15.335, 422.10, and 422.33,
  5 26 which contain references to the Internal Revenue Code for the
  5 27 state research activities credit for individuals, corporations,
  5 28 and corporations in economic development areas.
  5 29    Code section 422.9 provides individuals a deduction from
  5 30 net income for state sales and use taxes if the individual
  5 31 chose to deduct sales and use tax in lieu of state income taxes
  5 32 or the standard deduction for federal income tax purposes.
  5 33 This deduction was set to expire under both federal and Iowa
  5 34 law for tax years beginning on or after January 1, 2015.  The
  5 35 federal Protecting Americans from Tax Hikes Act of 2015 made
  6  1 the federal deduction permanent.  The bill allows the Iowa
  6  2 deduction for tax years beginning during the 2015 calendar
  6  3 year.
  6  4    The bill decouples, for Iowa income tax purposes for tax
  6  5 years ending on or after January 1, 2015, but before January
  6  6 1, 2016, from the federal additional first=year depreciation
  6  7 allowance in section 168(k) of the Internal Revenue Code
  6  8 (bonus depreciation) which was modified and extended through
  6  9 2019 by the federal Protecting Americans from Tax Hikes Act
  6 10 of 2015.  Taxpayers who claim bonus depreciation for federal
  6 11 tax purposes are, for the applicable tax year, required to add
  6 12 such depreciation amounts back to Iowa net income, but are
  6 13 then allowed under existing state law to deduct the amount of
  6 14 depreciation that would otherwise be allowable under federal
  6 15 law, without regard to the bonus depreciation allowance.
  6 16    Under current law, taxpayers are in some instances required,
  6 17 when calculating alternative minimum tax under Code section
  6 18 422.5(2) and itemized deductions under Code section 422.9(2),
  6 19 to recompute their federal adjusted gross income to take
  6 20 into account the fact that Iowa has decoupled from bonus
  6 21 depreciation.  The bill provides that taxpayers must make those
  6 22 same adjustments to federal adjusted gross income for tax year
  6 23 2015 to account for the fact that Iowa has decoupled from bonus
  6 24 depreciation as described above.
  6 25    The division takes effect upon enactment and applies
  6 26 retroactively to January 1, 2015.
  6 27    DIVISION II ==== SALES AND USE TAXES.  The bill rescinds
  6 28 several administrative rules and amendments to administrative
  6 29 rules of the department of revenue relating to the
  6 30 manufacturing sales and use tax exemptions under Code sections
  6 31 423.3(47) and 423.3(48) for the purchase of certain items used
  6 32 in manufacturing, research and development, data processing
  6 33 or storage, or recycling activities, and for the purchase of
  6 34 certain design and installation services related to machinery
  6 35 and equipment, and to the definitions of several applicable
  7  1 terms, including but not limited to definitions for tax=exempt
  7  2 "computers", "machinery", "equipment", "replacement parts",
  7  3 and "materials used to construct or self=construct computers,
  7  4 machinery, and equipment".  These administrative rules and
  7  5 amendments to administrative rules also concern the treatment
  7  6 of these tax=exempt items as they relate to the taxation of
  7  7 construction activities under Code sections 423.2(1)(b) and
  7  8 423.2(1)(c) by amending the method for determining whether
  7  9 the items are considered real property and taxed as building
  7 10 materials when purchased in furtherance of a construction
  7 11 contract, or considered tangible personal property eligible for
  7 12 the manufacturing sales and use tax exemptions.
  7 13    The effect of rescinding the amendments to these
  7 14 administrative rules is to restore the language of the
  7 15 affected rules to that as it existed prior to the date
  7 16 the adopted amendments to the rules were published in the
  7 17 Iowa administrative bulletin.  The bill directs the Iowa
  7 18 administrative code editor to restore the text of the affected
  7 19 rules to the language that existed on January 5, 2016, which
  7 20 was the day before the amendments were published in the
  7 21 Iowa administrative bulletin.  The bill also directs the
  7 22 Iowa administrative code editor to remove language of the
  7 23 rescinded rules from the Iowa administrative code. The Iowa
  7 24 administrative code editor is required to complete these
  7 25 actions as soon as practicable.  The provisions rescinding
  7 26 these administrative rules and amendments to administrative
  7 27 rules and requiring certain administrative code editor actions
  7 28 take effect upon enactment.
  7 29    The bill amends the sales tax exemption in Code section
  7 30 423.3(47) for the purchase or rental of certain items used in
  7 31 manufacturing, research and development, data processing or
  7 32 storage, or recycling activities.
  7 33    Under current law, the exemption includes replacement
  7 34 parts. The bill amends the exemption to include materials
  7 35 used to construct or self=construct replacement parts. The
  8  1 bill defines "replacement part" for purposes of the exemption
  8  2 to mean tangible personal property other than computers,
  8  3 machinery, equipment, or supplies, regardless of the cost or
  8  4 useful life of the property, that replaces a component of a
  8  5 computer, machinery, or equipment, performs the same or similar
  8  6 function as that component, and restores or improves the
  8  7 computer, machinery, or equipment.
  8  8    The bill also amends the exemption to include supplies
  8  9 and materials used to construct or self=construct supplies.
  8 10 "Supplies" is defined in the bill as tangible personal property
  8 11 that is not a computer, machinery, equipment, or replacement
  8 12 part and that meets one of the following four conditions:
  8 13    1.  The tangible personal property is to be connected to
  8 14 a computer, machinery, or equipment and requires regular
  8 15 replacement because it is consumed or deteriorates during use.
  8 16 The bill lists saw blades, drill bits, filters, and other
  8 17 similar items with a short useful life as examples.
  8 18    2.  The tangible personal property is used in conjunction
  8 19 with a computer, machinery, or equipment and is specially
  8 20 designed for use in manufacturing specific products and may
  8 21 be used interchangeably and intermittently on a particular
  8 22 computer, machine, or piece of equipment.  The bill lists jigs,
  8 23 dies, tools, and other similar items as examples.
  8 24    3.  The tangible personal property comes into physical
  8 25 contact with other tangible personal property used in
  8 26 processing and is used to assist with or maintain conditions
  8 27 necessary for processing.  The bill lists cutting fluids, oils,
  8 28 coolants, lubricants, and other similar items with a short
  8 29 useful life as examples.
  8 30    4. The tangible property is directly and primarily used
  8 31 in an activity described in Code section 423.3(47)(a)(1)=(6).
  8 32 The bill lists prototype materials and testing materials as
  8 33 examples.
  8 34    By operation of Code section 423.6, an item exempt from the
  8 35 imposition of the sales tax is also exempt from the use tax

  6 19 to recompute their federal adjusted gross income to take
  6 20 into account the fact that Iowa has decoupled from bonus
  6 21 depreciation.  The bill provides that taxpayers must make those
  6 22 same adjustments to federal adjusted gross income for tax year
  6 23 2015 to account for the fact that Iowa has decoupled from bonus
  6 24 depreciation as described above.
  6 25    The division takes effect upon enactment and applies
  6 26 retroactively to January 1, 2015.
  6 27    DIVISION II ==== SALES AND USE TAXES.  The bill rescinds
  6 28 several administrative rules and amendments to administrative
  6 29 rules of the department of revenue relating to the

  6 31 423.3(47) and 423.3(48) for the purchase of certain items used
  6 32 in manufacturing, research and development, data processing
  6 33 or storage, or recycling activities, and for the purchase of
  6 34 certain design and installation services related to machinery
  6 35 and equipment, and to the definitions of several applicable
  7  1 terms, including but not limited to definitions for tax=exempt
  7  2 "computers", "machinery", "equipment", "replacement parts",
  7  3 and "materials used to construct or self=construct computers,
  7  4 machinery, and equipment".  These administrative rules and
  7  5 amendments to administrative rules also concern the treatment
  7  6 of these tax=exempt items as they relate to the taxation of
  7  7 construction activities under Code sections 423.2(1)(b) and
  7  8 423.2(1)(c) by amending the method for determining whether
  7  9 the items are considered real property and taxed as building
  7 10 materials when purchased in furtherance of a construction
  7 11 contract, or considered tangible personal property eligible for
  7 12 the manufacturing sales and use tax exemptions.
  7 13    The effect of rescinding the amendments to these
  7 14 administrative rules is to restore the language of the
  7 15 affected rules to that as it existed prior to the date
  7 16 the adopted amendments to the rules were published in the
  7 17 Iowa administrative bulletin.  The bill directs the Iowa
  7 18 administrative code editor to restore the text of the affected

  7 22 Iowa administrative code editor to remove language of the
  7 23 rescinded rules from the Iowa administrative code. The Iowa
  7 24 administrative code editor is required to complete these
  7 25 actions as soon as practicable.  The provisions rescinding
  7 26 these administrative rules and amendments to administrative
  7 27 rules and requiring certain administrative code editor actions
  7 28 take effect upon enactment.
  7 29    The bill amends the sales tax exemption in Code section
  7 30 423.3(47) for the purchase or rental of certain items used in
  7 31 manufacturing, research and development, data processing or
  7 32 storage, or recycling activities.
  7 33    Under current law, the exemption includes replacement
  7 34 parts. The bill amends the exemption to include materials
  7 35 used to construct or self=construct replacement parts. The
  8  1 bill defines "replacement part" for purposes of the exemption
  8  2 to mean tangible personal property other than computers,
  8  3 machinery, equipment, or supplies, regardless of the cost or
  8  4 useful life of the property, that replaces a component of a
  8  5 computer, machinery, or equipment, performs the same or similar
  8  6 function as that component, and restores or improves the
  8  7 computer, machinery, or equipment.
  8  8    The bill also amends the exemption to include supplies
  8  9 and materials used to construct or self=construct supplies.
  8 10 "Supplies" is defined in the bill as tangible personal property
  8 11 that is not a computer, machinery, equipment, or replacement
  8 12 part and that meets one of the following four conditions:
  8 13    1.  The tangible personal property is to be connected to
  8 14 a computer, machinery, or equipment and requires regular
  8 15 replacement because it is consumed or deteriorates during use.
  8 16 The bill lists saw blades, drill bits, filters, and other
  8 17 similar items with a short useful life as examples.
  8 18    2.  The tangible personal property is used in conjunction
  8 19 with a computer, machinery, or equipment and is specially
  8 20 designed for use in manufacturing specific products and may
  8 21 be used interchangeably and intermittently on a particular
  8 22 computer, machine, or piece of equipment.  The bill lists jigs,
  8 23 dies, tools, and other similar items as examples.
  8 24    3.  The tangible personal property comes into physical
  8 25 contact with other tangible personal property used in
  8 26 processing and is used to assist with or maintain conditions
  8 27 necessary for processing.  The bill lists cutting fluids, oils,
  8 28 coolants, lubricants, and other similar items with a short
  8 29 useful life as examples.
  8 30    4. The tangible property is directly and primarily used
  8 31 in an activity described in Code section 423.3(47)(a)(1)=(6).
  8 32 The bill lists prototype materials and testing materials as

  5  5 division of this Act rescinding Iowa administrative code rules
  5  6 and amendments to Iowa administrative code rules, being deemed
  5  7 of immediate importance, take effect upon enactment.
  5  8                           EXPLANATION
  5  9 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  5 10 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  5 11    This bill relates to state taxation.
  5 12    DIVISION I ==== INTERNAL REVENUE CODE REFERENCES.  The bill
  5 13 provides that notwithstanding several Code provisions as
  5 14 specified in the bill, the definitions of "Internal Revenue
  5 15 Code" in those Code provisions and, by internal reference,
  5 16 in other sections of the Iowa Code and Iowa Acts shall mean
  5 17 the Internal Revenue Code in effect on, or as amended to and
  5 18 including, January 1, 2016.  This definition change applies
  5 19 only to the period beginning January 1, 2015, and ending
  5 20 December 31, 2015, and for tax years beginning during the 2015
  5 21 calendar year.
  5 22    The affected Code provisions include Code sections 422.3
  5 23 and 422.32, general definition sections in the chapter of the
  5 24 Code that governs corporate and individual income tax and the
  5 25 franchise tax, and Code sections 15.335, 422.10, and 422.33,
  5 26 which contain references to the Internal Revenue Code for the
  5 27 state research activities credit for individuals, corporations,
  5 28 and corporations in economic development areas.
  5 29    Code section 422.9 provides individuals a deduction from
  5 30 net income for state sales and use taxes if the individual
  5 31 chose to deduct sales and use tax in lieu of state income taxes
  5 32 or the standard deduction for federal income tax purposes.
  5 33 This deduction was set to expire under both federal and Iowa
  5 34 law for tax years beginning on or after January 1, 2015.  The
  5 35 federal Protecting Americans from Tax Hikes Act of 2015 made
  6  1 the federal deduction permanent.  The bill allows the Iowa
  6  2 deduction for tax years beginning during the 2015 calendar
  6  3 year.
  6  4    The bill decouples, for Iowa income tax purposes for tax
  6  5 years ending on or after January 1, 2015, but before January
  6  6 1, 2016, from the federal additional first=year depreciation
  6  7 allowance in section 168(k) of the Internal Revenue Code
  6  8 (bonus depreciation) which was modified and extended through
  6  9 2019 by the federal Protecting Americans from Tax Hikes Act
  6 10 of 2015.  Taxpayers who claim bonus depreciation for federal
  6 11 tax purposes are, for the applicable tax year, required to add
  6 12 such depreciation amounts back to Iowa net income, but are
  6 13 then allowed under existing state law to deduct the amount of
  6 14 depreciation that would otherwise be allowable under federal
  6 15 law, without regard to the bonus depreciation allowance.
  6 16    Under current law, taxpayers are in some instances required,
  6 17 when calculating alternative minimum tax under Code section
  6 18 422.5(2) and itemized deductions under Code section 422.9(2),
  6 19 to recompute their federal adjusted gross income to take
  6 20 into account the fact that Iowa has decoupled from bonus
  6 21 depreciation.  The bill provides that taxpayers must make those
  6 22 same adjustments to federal adjusted gross income for tax year
  6 23 2015 to account for the fact that Iowa has decoupled from bonus
  6 24 depreciation as described above.
  6 25    The division takes effect upon enactment and applies
  6 26 retroactively to January 1, 2015.

  6 29 rules of the department of revenue relating to the
  6 30 manufacturing sales and use tax exemptions under Code sections

  6 32 in manufacturing, research and development, data processing
  6 33 or storage, or recycling activities, and for the purchase of
  6 34 certain design and installation services related to machinery
  6 35 and equipment, and to the definitions of several applicable
  7  1 terms, including but not limited to definitions for tax=exempt
  7  2 "computers", "machinery", "equipment", "replacement parts",
  7  3 and "materials used to construct or self=construct computers,
  7  4 machinery, and equipment".  These administrative rules and
  7  5 amendments to administrative rules also concern the treatment
  7  6 of these tax=exempt items as they relate to the taxation of
  7  7 construction activities under Code sections 423.2(1)(b) and
  7  8 423.2(1)(c) by amending the method for determining whether
  7  9 the items are considered real property and taxed as building
  7 10 materials when purchased in furtherance of a construction
  7 11 contract, or considered tangible personal property eligible for
  7 12 the manufacturing sales and use tax exemptions.
  7 13    The effect of rescinding the amendments to these
  7 14 administrative rules is to restore the language of the
  7 15 affected rules to that as it existed prior to the date

  7 30 423.3(47) for the purchase or rental of certain items used in
  7 31 manufacturing, research and development, data processing or

  7 33    Under current law, the exemption includes replacement
  7 34 parts. The bill amends the exemption to include materials
  7 35 used to construct or self=construct replacement parts. The
  8  1 bill defines "replacement part" for purposes of the exemption
  8  2 to mean tangible personal property other than computers,
  8  3 machinery, equipment, or supplies, regardless of the cost or
  8  4 useful life of the property, that replaces a component of a
  8  5 computer, machinery, or equipment, performs the same or similar

  8  7 computer, machinery, or equipment.
  8  8    The bill also amends the exemption to include supplies

  5  5 division of this Act rescinding Iowa administrative code rules
  5  6 and amendments to Iowa administrative code rules, being deemed
  5  7 of immediate importance, take effect upon enactment.
  5  8                           EXPLANATION
  5  9 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  5 10 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  5 11    This bill relates to state taxation.
  5 12    DIVISION I ==== INTERNAL REVENUE CODE REFERENCES.  The bill
  5 13 provides that notwithstanding several Code provisions as
  5 14 specified in the bill, the definitions of "Internal Revenue
  5 15 Code" in those Code provisions and, by internal reference,
  5 16 in other sections of the Iowa Code and Iowa Acts shall mean
  5 17 the Internal Revenue Code in effect on, or as amended to and
  5 18 including, January 1, 2016.  This definition change applies
  5 19 only to the period beginning January 1, 2015, and ending
  5 20 December 31, 2015, and for tax years beginning during the 2015
  5 21 calendar year.
  5 22    The affected Code provisions include Code sections 422.3
  5 23 and 422.32, general definition sections in the chapter of the
  5 24 Code that governs corporate and individual income tax and the
  5 25 franchise tax, and Code sections 15.335, 422.10, and 422.33,
  5 26 which contain references to the Internal Revenue Code for the
  5 27 state research activities credit for individuals, corporations,
  5 28 and corporations in economic development areas.
  5 29    Code section 422.9 provides individuals a deduction from
  5 30 net income for state sales and use taxes if the individual
  5 31 chose to deduct sales and use tax in lieu of state income taxes
  5 32 or the standard deduction for federal income tax purposes.
  5 33 This deduction was set to expire under both federal and Iowa
  5 34 law for tax years beginning on or after January 1, 2015.  The
  5 35 federal Protecting Americans from Tax Hikes Act of 2015 made
  6  1 the federal deduction permanent.  The bill allows the Iowa
  6  2 deduction for tax years beginning during the 2015 calendar
  6  3 year.
  6  4    The bill decouples, for Iowa income tax purposes for tax
  6  5 years ending on or after January 1, 2015, but before January
  6  6 1, 2016, from the federal additional first=year depreciation
  6  7 allowance in section 168(k) of the Internal Revenue Code
  6  8 (bonus depreciation) which was modified and extended through
  6  9 2019 by the federal Protecting Americans from Tax Hikes Act
  6 10 of 2015.  Taxpayers who claim bonus depreciation for federal
  6 11 tax purposes are, for the applicable tax year, required to add
  6 12 such depreciation amounts back to Iowa net income, but are
  6 13 then allowed under existing state law to deduct the amount of
  6 14 depreciation that would otherwise be allowable under federal
  6 15 law, without regard to the bonus depreciation allowance.
  6 16    Under current law, taxpayers are in some instances required,
  6 17 when calculating alternative minimum tax under Code section
  6 18 422.5(2) and itemized deductions under Code section 422.9(2),
  6 19 to recompute their federal adjusted gross income to take
  6 20 into account the fact that Iowa has decoupled from bonus
  6 21 depreciation.  The bill provides that taxpayers must make those
  6 22 same adjustments to federal adjusted gross income for tax year
  6 23 2015 to account for the fact that Iowa has decoupled from bonus
  6 24 depreciation as described above.
  6 25    The division takes effect upon enactment and applies
  6 26 retroactively to January 1, 2015.
  6 27    DIVISION II ==== SALES AND USE TAXES.  The bill rescinds
  6 28 several administrative rules and amendments to administrative
  6 29 rules of the department of revenue relating to the
  6 30 manufacturing sales and use tax exemptions under Code sections
  6 31 423.3(47) and 423.3(48) for the purchase of certain items used
  6 32 in manufacturing, research and development, data processing
  6 33 or storage, or recycling activities, and for the purchase of
  6 34 certain design and installation services related to machinery
  6 35 and equipment, and to the definitions of several applicable
  7  1 terms, including but not limited to definitions for tax=exempt
  7  2 "computers", "machinery", "equipment", "replacement parts",
  7  3 and "materials used to construct or self=construct computers,
  7  4 machinery, and equipment".  These administrative rules and
  7  5 amendments to administrative rules also concern the treatment
  7  6 of these tax=exempt items as they relate to the taxation of
  7  7 construction activities under Code sections 423.2(1)(b) and
  7  8 423.2(1)(c) by amending the method for determining whether
  7  9 the items are considered real property and taxed as building
  7 10 materials when purchased in furtherance of a construction
  7 11 contract, or considered tangible personal property eligible for
  7 12 the manufacturing sales and use tax exemptions.
  7 13    The effect of rescinding the amendments to these
  7 14 administrative rules is to restore the language of the
  7 15 affected rules to that as it existed prior to the date
  7 16 the adopted amendments to the rules were published in the
  7 17 Iowa administrative bulletin.  The bill directs the Iowa
  7 18 administrative code editor to restore the text of the affected
  7 19 rules to the language that existed on January 5, 2016, which
  7 20 was the day before the amendments were published in the
  7 21 Iowa administrative bulletin.  The bill also directs the
  7 22 Iowa administrative code editor to remove language of the
  7 23 rescinded rules from the Iowa administrative code. The Iowa
  7 24 administrative code editor is required to complete these
  7 25 actions as soon as practicable.  The provisions rescinding
  7 26 these administrative rules and amendments to administrative
  7 27 rules and requiring certain administrative code editor actions
  7 28 take effect upon enactment.
  7 29    The bill amends the sales tax exemption in Code section
  7 30 423.3(47) for the purchase or rental of certain items used in
  7 31 manufacturing, research and development, data processing or
  7 32 storage, or recycling activities.
  7 33    Under current law, the exemption includes replacement
  7 34 parts. The bill amends the exemption to include materials
  7 35 used to construct or self=construct replacement parts. The
  8  1 bill defines "replacement part" for purposes of the exemption
  8  2 to mean tangible personal property other than computers,
  8  3 machinery, equipment, or supplies, regardless of the cost or
  8  4 useful life of the property, that replaces a component of a
  8  5 computer, machinery, or equipment, performs the same or similar
  8  6 function as that component, and restores or improves the
  8  7 computer, machinery, or equipment.
  8  8    The bill also amends the exemption to include supplies
  8  9 and materials used to construct or self=construct supplies.
  8 10 "Supplies" is defined in the bill as tangible personal property
  8 11 that is not a computer, machinery, equipment, or replacement
  8 12 part and that meets one of the following four conditions:
  8 13    1.  The tangible personal property is to be connected to
  8 14 a computer, machinery, or equipment and requires regular
  8 15 replacement because it is consumed or deteriorates during use.
  8 16 The bill lists saw blades, drill bits, filters, and other
  8 17 similar items with a short useful life as examples.
  8 18    2.  The tangible personal property is used in conjunction
  8 19 with a computer, machinery, or equipment and is specially
  8 20 designed for use in manufacturing specific products and may
  8 21 be used interchangeably and intermittently on a particular
  8 22 computer, machine, or piece of equipment.  The bill lists jigs,
  8 23 dies, tools, and other similar items as examples.
  8 24    3.  The tangible personal property comes into physical
  8 25 contact with other tangible personal property used in
  8 26 processing and is used to assist with or maintain conditions
  8 27 necessary for processing.  The bill lists cutting fluids, oils,
  8 28 coolants, lubricants, and other similar items with a short
  8 29 useful life as examples.
  8 30    4. The tangible property is directly and primarily used
  8 31 in an activity described in Code section 423.3(47)(a)(1)=(6).
  8 32 The bill lists prototype materials and testing materials as
  8 33 examples.
  8 34    By operation of Code section 423.6, an item exempt from the
  8 35 imposition of the sales tax is also exempt from the use tax
  9  1 imposed in Code section 423.5.>

  4 31 processing and is used to assist with or maintain conditions
  4 32 necessary for processing, including but not limited to cutting

  5  7 of immediate importance, take effect upon enactment.
  5  8                           EXPLANATION
  5  9 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  5 10 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  5 11    This bill relates to state taxation.
  5 12    DIVISION I ==== INTERNAL REVENUE CODE REFERENCES.  The bill
  5 13 provides that notwithstanding several Code provisions as
  5 14 specified in the bill, the definitions of "Internal Revenue
  5 15 Code" in those Code provisions and, by internal reference,
  5 16 in other sections of the Iowa Code and Iowa Acts shall mean
  5 17 the Internal Revenue Code in effect on, or as amended to and
  5 18 including, January 1, 2016.  This definition change applies
  5 19 only to the period beginning January 1, 2015, and ending
  5 20 December 31, 2015, and for tax years beginning during the 2015
  5 21 calendar year.
  5 22    The affected Code provisions include Code sections 422.3
  5 23 and 422.32, general definition sections in the chapter of the
  5 24 Code that governs corporate and individual income tax and the
  5 25 franchise tax, and Code sections 15.335, 422.10, and 422.33,
  5 26 which contain references to the Internal Revenue Code for the
  5 27 state research activities credit for individuals, corporations,
  5 28 and corporations in economic development areas.
  5 29    Code section 422.9 provides individuals a deduction from
  5 30 net income for state sales and use taxes if the individual
  5 31 chose to deduct sales and use tax in lieu of state income taxes
  5 32 or the standard deduction for federal income tax purposes.
  5 33 This deduction was set to expire under both federal and Iowa
  5 34 law for tax years beginning on or after January 1, 2015.  The
  5 35 federal Protecting Americans from Tax Hikes Act of 2015 made
  6  1 the federal deduction permanent.  The bill allows the Iowa
  6  2 deduction for tax years beginning during the 2015 calendar
  6  3 year.
  6  4    The bill decouples, for Iowa income tax purposes for tax
  6  5 years ending on or after January 1, 2015, but before January
  6  6 1, 2016, from the federal additional first=year depreciation
  6  7 allowance in section 168(k) of the Internal Revenue Code
  6  8 (bonus depreciation) which was modified and extended through
  6  9 2019 by the federal Protecting Americans from Tax Hikes Act
  6 10 of 2015.  Taxpayers who claim bonus depreciation for federal
  6 11 tax purposes are, for the applicable tax year, required to add
  6 12 such depreciation amounts back to Iowa net income, but are
  6 13 then allowed under existing state law to deduct the amount of
  6 14 depreciation that would otherwise be allowable under federal
  6 15 law, without regard to the bonus depreciation allowance.
  6 16    Under current law, taxpayers are in some instances required,
  6 17 when calculating alternative minimum tax under Code section
  6 18 422.5(2) and itemized deductions under Code section 422.9(2),
  6 19 to recompute their federal adjusted gross income to take
  6 20 into account the fact that Iowa has decoupled from bonus
  6 21 depreciation.  The bill provides that taxpayers must make those
  6 22 same adjustments to federal adjusted gross income for tax year
  6 23 2015 to account for the fact that Iowa has decoupled from bonus
  6 24 depreciation as described above.
  6 25    The division takes effect upon enactment and applies
  6 26 retroactively to January 1, 2015.
  6 27    DIVISION II ==== SALES AND USE TAXES.  The bill rescinds
  6 28 several administrative rules and amendments to administrative
  6 29 rules of the department of revenue relating to the
  6 30 manufacturing sales and use tax exemptions under Code sections
  6 31 423.3(47) and 423.3(48) for the purchase of certain items used
  6 32 in manufacturing, research and development, data processing
  6 33 or storage, or recycling activities, and for the purchase of
  6 34 certain design and installation services related to machinery
  6 35 and equipment, and to the definitions of several applicable
  7  1 terms, including but not limited to definitions for tax=exempt
  7  2 "computers", "machinery", "equipment", "replacement parts",
  7  3 and "materials used to construct or self=construct computers,
  7  4 machinery, and equipment".  These administrative rules and
  7  5 amendments to administrative rules also concern the treatment
  7  6 of these tax=exempt items as they relate to the taxation of
  7  7 construction activities under Code sections 423.2(1)(b) and
  7  8 423.2(1)(c) by amending the method for determining whether
  7  9 the items are considered real property and taxed as building
  7 10 materials when purchased in furtherance of a construction
  7 11 contract, or considered tangible personal property eligible for
  7 12 the manufacturing sales and use tax exemptions.
  7 13    The effect of rescinding the amendments to these
  7 14 administrative rules is to restore the language of the
  7 15 affected rules to that as it existed prior to the date
  7 16 the adopted amendments to the rules were published in the
  7 17 Iowa administrative bulletin.  The bill directs the Iowa
  7 18 administrative code editor to restore the text of the affected
  7 19 rules to the language that existed on January 5, 2016, which
  7 20 was the day before the amendments were published in the
  7 21 Iowa administrative bulletin.  The bill also directs the
  7 22 Iowa administrative code editor to remove language of the
  7 23 rescinded rules from the Iowa administrative code. The Iowa
  7 24 administrative code editor is required to complete these
  7 25 actions as soon as practicable.  The provisions rescinding
  7 26 these administrative rules and amendments to administrative
  7 27 rules and requiring certain administrative code editor actions
  7 28 take effect upon enactment.
  7 29    The bill amends the sales tax exemption in Code section
  7 30 423.3(47) for the purchase or rental of certain items used in
  7 31 manufacturing, research and development, data processing or
  7 32 storage, or recycling activities.
  7 33    Under current law, the exemption includes replacement
  7 34 parts. The bill amends the exemption to include materials
  7 35 used to construct or self=construct replacement parts. The
  8  1 bill defines "replacement part" for purposes of the exemption
  8  2 to mean tangible personal property other than computers,
  8  3 machinery, equipment, or supplies, regardless of the cost or
  8  4 useful life of the property, that replaces a component of a
  8  5 computer, machinery, or equipment, performs the same or similar
  8  6 function as that component, and restores or improves the
  8  7 computer, machinery, or equipment.
  8  8    The bill also amends the exemption to include supplies
  8  9 and materials used to construct or self=construct supplies.
  8 10 "Supplies" is defined in the bill as tangible personal property
  8 11 that is not a computer, machinery, equipment, or replacement

  8 20 designed for use in manufacturing specific products and may
  8 21 be used interchangeably and intermittently on a particular
  8 22 computer, machine, or piece of equipment.  The bill lists jigs,

  8 31 in an activity described in Code section 423.3(47)(a)(1)=(6).
  8 32 The bill lists prototype materials and testing materials as
  8 33 examples.
  8 34    By operation of Code section 423.6, an item exempt from the

  7  1 terms, including but not limited to definitions for tax=exempt
  7  2 "computers", "machinery", "equipment", "replacement parts",
  7  3 and "materials used to construct or self=construct computers,
  7  4 machinery, and equipment".  These administrative rules and
  7  5 amendments to administrative rules also concern the treatment
  7  6 of these tax=exempt items as they relate to the taxation of
  7  7 construction activities under Code sections 423.2(1)(b) and
  7  8 423.2(1)(c) by amending the method for determining whether
  7  9 the items are considered real property and taxed as building
  7 10 materials when purchased in furtherance of a construction
  7 11 contract, or considered tangible personal property eligible for
  7 12 the manufacturing sales and use tax exemptions.
  7 13    The effect of rescinding the amendments to these
  7 14 administrative rules is to restore the language of the
  7 15 affected rules to that as it existed prior to the date
  7 16 the adopted amendments to the rules were published in the
  7 17 Iowa administrative bulletin.  The bill directs the Iowa
  7 18 administrative code editor to restore the text of the affected
  7 19 rules to the language that existed on January 5, 2016, which
  7 20 was the day before the amendments were published in the
  7 21 Iowa administrative bulletin.  The bill also directs the
  7 22 Iowa administrative code editor to remove language of the
  7 23 rescinded rules from the Iowa administrative code. The Iowa
  7 24 administrative code editor is required to complete these
  7 25 actions as soon as practicable.  The provisions rescinding
  7 26 these administrative rules and amendments to administrative
  7 27 rules and requiring certain administrative code editor actions
  7 28 take effect upon enactment.
  7 29    The bill amends the sales tax exemption in Code section
  7 30 423.3(47) for the purchase or rental of certain items used in
  7 31 manufacturing, research and development, data processing or
  7 32 storage, or recycling activities.
  7 33    Under current law, the exemption includes replacement
  7 34 parts. The bill amends the exemption to include materials
  7 35 used to construct or self=construct replacement parts. The
  8  1 bill defines "replacement part" for purposes of the exemption
  8  2 to mean tangible personal property other than computers,
  8  3 machinery, equipment, or supplies, regardless of the cost or
  8  4 useful life of the property, that replaces a component of a
  8  5 computer, machinery, or equipment, performs the same or similar
  8  6 function as that component, and restores or improves the
  8  7 computer, machinery, or equipment.
  8  8    The bill also amends the exemption to include supplies
  8  9 and materials used to construct or self=construct supplies.
  8 10 "Supplies" is defined in the bill as tangible personal property
  8 11 that is not a computer, machinery, equipment, or replacement
  8 12 part and that meets one of the following four conditions:
  8 13    1.  The tangible personal property is to be connected to
  8 14 a computer, machinery, or equipment and requires regular
  8 15 replacement because it is consumed or deteriorates during use.
  8 16 The bill lists saw blades, drill bits, filters, and other
  8 17 similar items with a short useful life as examples.
  8 18    2.  The tangible personal property is used in conjunction
  8 19 with a computer, machinery, or equipment and is specially
  8 20 designed for use in manufacturing specific products and may
  8 21 be used interchangeably and intermittently on a particular
  8 22 computer, machine, or piece of equipment.  The bill lists jigs,
  8 23 dies, tools, and other similar items as examples.
  8 24    3.  The tangible personal property comes into physical
  8 25 contact with other tangible personal property used in
  8 26 processing and is used to assist with or maintain conditions
  8 27 necessary for processing.  The bill lists cutting fluids, oils,
  8 28 coolants, lubricants, and other similar items with a short
  8 29 useful life as examples.
  8 30    4. The tangible property is directly and primarily used
  8 31 in an activity described in Code section 423.3(47)(a)(1)=(6).
  8 32 The bill lists prototype materials and testing materials as
  8 33 examples.
  8 34    By operation of Code section 423.6, an item exempt from the
  8 35 imposition of the sales tax is also exempt from the use tax
  9  1 imposed in Code section 423.5.>

  5  4    Sec. 10.  EFFECTIVE UPON ENACTMENT.  The sections of this
  5  5 division of this Act rescinding Iowa administrative code rules
  5  6 and amendments to Iowa administrative code rules, being deemed
  5  7 of immediate importance, take effect upon enactment.
  5  8                           EXPLANATION
  5  9 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  5 10 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  5 11    This bill relates to state taxation.
  5 12    DIVISION I ==== INTERNAL REVENUE CODE REFERENCES.  The bill
  5 13 provides that notwithstanding several Code provisions as
  5 14 specified in the bill, the definitions of "Internal Revenue
  5 15 Code" in those Code provisions and, by internal reference,
  5 16 in other sections of the Iowa Code and Iowa Acts shall mean
  5 17 the Internal Revenue Code in effect on, or as amended to and
  5 18 including, January 1, 2016.  This definition change applies
  5 19 only to the period beginning January 1, 2015, and ending
  5 20 December 31, 2015, and for tax years beginning during the 2015
  5 21 calendar year.
  5 22    The affected Code provisions include Code sections 422.3
  5 23 and 422.32, general definition sections in the chapter of the
  5 24 Code that governs corporate and individual income tax and the
  5 25 franchise tax, and Code sections 15.335, 422.10, and 422.33,
  5 26 which contain references to the Internal Revenue Code for the
  5 27 state research activities credit for individuals, corporations,
  5 28 and corporations in economic development areas.
  5 29    Code section 422.9 provides individuals a deduction from
  5 30 net income for state sales and use taxes if the individual
  5 31 chose to deduct sales and use tax in lieu of state income taxes
  5 32 or the standard deduction for federal income tax purposes.
  5 33 This deduction was set to expire under both federal and Iowa
  5 34 law for tax years beginning on or after January 1, 2015.  The
  5 35 federal Protecting Americans from Tax Hikes Act of 2015 made
  6  1 the federal deduction permanent.  The bill allows the Iowa
  6  2 deduction for tax years beginning during the 2015 calendar
  6  3 year.
  6  4    The bill decouples, for Iowa income tax purposes for tax
  6  5 years ending on or after January 1, 2015, but before January
  6  6 1, 2016, from the federal additional first=year depreciation
  6  7 allowance in section 168(k) of the Internal Revenue Code
  6  8 (bonus depreciation) which was modified and extended through
  6  9 2019 by the federal Protecting Americans from Tax Hikes Act
  6 10 of 2015.  Taxpayers who claim bonus depreciation for federal
  6 11 tax purposes are, for the applicable tax year, required to add
  6 12 such depreciation amounts back to Iowa net income, but are
  6 13 then allowed under existing state law to deduct the amount of
  6 14 depreciation that would otherwise be allowable under federal
  6 15 law, without regard to the bonus depreciation allowance.
  6 16    Under current law, taxpayers are in some instances required,
  6 17 when calculating alternative minimum tax under Code section
  6 18 422.5(2) and itemized deductions under Code section 422.9(2),
  6 19 to recompute their federal adjusted gross income to take
  6 20 into account the fact that Iowa has decoupled from bonus
  6 21 depreciation.  The bill provides that taxpayers must make those
  6 22 same adjustments to federal adjusted gross income for tax year
  6 23 2015 to account for the fact that Iowa has decoupled from bonus
  6 24 depreciation as described above.
  6 25    The division takes effect upon enactment and applies
  6 26 retroactively to January 1, 2015.
  6 27    DIVISION II ==== SALES AND USE TAXES.  The bill rescinds
  6 28 several administrative rules and amendments to administrative
  6 29 rules of the department of revenue relating to the
  6 30 manufacturing sales and use tax exemptions under Code sections
  6 31 423.3(47) and 423.3(48) for the purchase of certain items used
  6 32 in manufacturing, research and development, data processing
  6 33 or storage, or recycling activities, and for the purchase of
  6 34 certain design and installation services related to machinery
  6 35 and equipment, and to the definitions of several applicable
  7  1 terms, including but not limited to definitions for tax=exempt
  7  2 "computers", "machinery", "equipment", "replacement parts",
  7  3 and "materials used to construct or self=construct computers,
  7  4 machinery, and equipment".  These administrative rules and
  7  5 amendments to administrative rules also concern the treatment
  7  6 of these tax=exempt items as they relate to the taxation of
  7  7 construction activities under Code sections 423.2(1)(b) and
  7  8 423.2(1)(c) by amending the method for determining whether
  7  9 the items are considered real property and taxed as building
  7 10 materials when purchased in furtherance of a construction
  7 11 contract, or considered tangible personal property eligible for
  7 12 the manufacturing sales and use tax exemptions.
  7 13    The effect of rescinding the amendments to these
  7 14 administrative rules is to restore the language of the
  7 15 affected rules to that as it existed prior to the date
  7 16 the adopted amendments to the rules were published in the
  7 17 Iowa administrative bulletin.  The bill directs the Iowa
  7 18 administrative code editor to restore the text of the affected
  7 19 rules to the language that existed on January 5, 2016, which
  7 20 was the day before the amendments were published in the
  7 21 Iowa administrative bulletin.  The bill also directs the
  7 22 Iowa administrative code editor to remove language of the
  7 23 rescinded rules from the Iowa administrative code. The Iowa
  7 24 administrative code editor is required to complete these
  7 25 actions as soon as practicable.  The provisions rescinding
  7 26 these administrative rules and amendments to administrative
  7 27 rules and requiring certain administrative code editor actions
  7 28 take effect upon enactment.
  7 29    The bill amends the sales tax exemption in Code section
  7 30 423.3(47) for the purchase or rental of certain items used in
  7 31 manufacturing, research and development, data processing or
  7 32 storage, or recycling activities.
  7 33    Under current law, the exemption includes replacement
  7 34 parts. The bill amends the exemption to include materials
  7 35 used to construct or self=construct replacement parts. The
  8  1 bill defines "replacement part" for purposes of the exemption
  8  2 to mean tangible personal property other than computers,
  8  3 machinery, equipment, or supplies, regardless of the cost or
  8  4 useful life of the property, that replaces a component of a
  8  5 computer, machinery, or equipment, performs the same or similar
  8  6 function as that component, and restores or improves the
  8  7 computer, machinery, or equipment.
  8  8    The bill also amends the exemption to include supplies
  8  9 and materials used to construct or self=construct supplies.
  8 10 "Supplies" is defined in the bill as tangible personal property

  8 31 in an activity described in Code section 423.3(47)(a)(1)=(6).
  8 32 The bill lists prototype materials and testing materials as
  8 33 examples.
  8 34    By operation of Code section 423.6, an item exempt from the

  6  8 (bonus depreciation) which was modified and extended through
  6  9 2019 by the federal Protecting Americans from Tax Hikes Act
  6 10 of 2015.  Taxpayers who claim bonus depreciation for federal
  6 11 tax purposes are, for the applicable tax year, required to add
  6 12 such depreciation amounts back to Iowa net income, but are
  6 13 then allowed under existing state law to deduct the amount of
  6 14 depreciation that would otherwise be allowable under federal
  6 15 law, without regard to the bonus depreciation allowance.
  6 16    Under current law, taxpayers are in some instances required,
  6 17 when calculating alternative minimum tax under Code section
  6 18 422.5(2) and itemized deductions under Code section 422.9(2),
  6 19 to recompute their federal adjusted gross income to take
  6 20 into account the fact that Iowa has decoupled from bonus
  6 21 depreciation.  The bill provides that taxpayers must make those
  6 22 same adjustments to federal adjusted gross income for tax year
  6 23 2015 to account for the fact that Iowa has decoupled from bonus
  6 24 depreciation as described above.
  6 25    The division takes effect upon enactment and applies
  6 26 retroactively to January 1, 2015.
  6 27    DIVISION II ==== SALES AND USE TAXES.  The bill rescinds
  6 28 several administrative rules and amendments to administrative
  6 29 rules of the department of revenue relating to the
  6 30 manufacturing sales and use tax exemptions under Code sections
  6 31 423.3(47) and 423.3(48) for the purchase of certain items used
  6 32 in manufacturing, research and development, data processing
  6 33 or storage, or recycling activities, and for the purchase of
  6 34 certain design and installation services related to machinery
  6 35 and equipment, and to the definitions of several applicable
  7  1 terms, including but not limited to definitions for tax=exempt
  7  2 "computers", "machinery", "equipment", "replacement parts",
  7  3 and "materials used to construct or self=construct computers,
  7  4 machinery, and equipment".  These administrative rules and
  7  5 amendments to administrative rules also concern the treatment
  7  6 of these tax=exempt items as they relate to the taxation of
  7  7 construction activities under Code sections 423.2(1)(b) and
  7  8 423.2(1)(c) by amending the method for determining whether
  7  9 the items are considered real property and taxed as building
  7 10 materials when purchased in furtherance of a construction
  7 11 contract, or considered tangible personal property eligible for
  7 12 the manufacturing sales and use tax exemptions.
  7 13    The effect of rescinding the amendments to these
  7 14 administrative rules is to restore the language of the
  7 15 affected rules to that as it existed prior to the date
  7 16 the adopted amendments to the rules were published in the
  7 17 Iowa administrative bulletin.  The bill directs the Iowa
  7 18 administrative code editor to restore the text of the affected
  7 19 rules to the language that existed on January 5, 2016, which
  7 20 was the day before the amendments were published in the
  7 21 Iowa administrative bulletin.  The bill also directs the
  7 22 Iowa administrative code editor to remove language of the
  7 23 rescinded rules from the Iowa administrative code. The Iowa
  7 24 administrative code editor is required to complete these
  7 25 actions as soon as practicable.  The provisions rescinding
  7 26 these administrative rules and amendments to administrative
  7 27 rules and requiring certain administrative code editor actions
  7 28 take effect upon enactment.
  7 29    The bill amends the sales tax exemption in Code section
  7 30 423.3(47) for the purchase or rental of certain items used in
  7 31 manufacturing, research and development, data processing or
  7 32 storage, or recycling activities.
  7 33    Under current law, the exemption includes replacement
  7 34 parts. The bill amends the exemption to include materials
  7 35 used to construct or self=construct replacement parts. The
  8  1 bill defines "replacement part" for purposes of the exemption
  8  2 to mean tangible personal property other than computers,
  8  3 machinery, equipment, or supplies, regardless of the cost or
  8  4 useful life of the property, that replaces a component of a
  8  5 computer, machinery, or equipment, performs the same or similar
  8  6 function as that component, and restores or improves the
  8  7 computer, machinery, or equipment.
  8  8    The bill also amends the exemption to include supplies
  8  9 and materials used to construct or self=construct supplies.
  8 10 "Supplies" is defined in the bill as tangible personal property
  8 11 that is not a computer, machinery, equipment, or replacement
  8 12 part and that meets one of the following four conditions:
  8 13    1.  The tangible personal property is to be connected to
  8 14 a computer, machinery, or equipment and requires regular
  8 15 replacement because it is consumed or deteriorates during use.
  8 16 The bill lists saw blades, drill bits, filters, and other
  8 17 similar items with a short useful life as examples.
  8 18    2.  The tangible personal property is used in conjunction
  8 19 with a computer, machinery, or equipment and is specially
  8 20 designed for use in manufacturing specific products and may
  8 21 be used interchangeably and intermittently on a particular
  8 22 computer, machine, or piece of equipment.  The bill lists jigs,
  8 23 dies, tools, and other similar items as examples.
  8 24    3.  The tangible personal property comes into physical
  8 25 contact with other tangible personal property used in
  8 26 processing and is used to assist with or maintain conditions
  8 27 necessary for processing.  The bill lists cutting fluids, oils,
  8 28 coolants, lubricants, and other similar items with a short
  8 29 useful life as examples.
  8 30    4. The tangible property is directly and primarily used
  8 31 in an activity described in Code section 423.3(47)(a)(1)=(6).
  8 32 The bill lists prototype materials and testing materials as
  8 33 examples.
  8 34    By operation of Code section 423.6, an item exempt from the
  8 35 imposition of the sales tax is also exempt from the use tax
  9  1 imposed in Code section 423.5.>

  5  9 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  5 10 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  5 11    This bill relates to state taxation.
  5 12    DIVISION I ==== INTERNAL REVENUE CODE REFERENCES.  The bill
  5 13 provides that notwithstanding several Code provisions as
  5 14 specified in the bill, the definitions of "Internal Revenue
  5 15 Code" in those Code provisions and, by internal reference,
  5 16 in other sections of the Iowa Code and Iowa Acts shall mean
  5 17 the Internal Revenue Code in effect on, or as amended to and
  5 18 including, January 1, 2016.  This definition change applies
  5 19 only to the period beginning January 1, 2015, and ending
  5 20 December 31, 2015, and for tax years beginning during the 2015
  5 21 calendar year.

  5 26 which contain references to the Internal Revenue Code for the
  5 27 state research activities credit for individuals, corporations,
  5 28 and corporations in economic development areas.
  5 29    Code section 422.9 provides individuals a deduction from
  5 30 net income for state sales and use taxes if the individual
  5 31 chose to deduct sales and use tax in lieu of state income taxes
  5 32 or the standard deduction for federal income tax purposes.
  5 33 This deduction was set to expire under both federal and Iowa
  5 34 law for tax years beginning on or after January 1, 2015.  The
  5 35 federal Protecting Americans from Tax Hikes Act of 2015 made
  6  1 the federal deduction permanent.  The bill allows the Iowa
  6  2 deduction for tax years beginning during the 2015 calendar
  6  3 year.
  6  4    The bill decouples, for Iowa income tax purposes for tax
  6  5 years ending on or after January 1, 2015, but before January
  6  6 1, 2016, from the federal additional first=year depreciation
  6  7 allowance in section 168(k) of the Internal Revenue Code
  6  8 (bonus depreciation) which was modified and extended through

  6 19 to recompute their federal adjusted gross income to take
  6 20 into account the fact that Iowa has decoupled from bonus
  6 21 depreciation.  The bill provides that taxpayers must make those

  7  6 of these tax=exempt items as they relate to the taxation of
  7  7 construction activities under Code sections 423.2(1)(b) and
  7  8 423.2(1)(c) by amending the method for determining whether
  7  9 the items are considered real property and taxed as building
  7 10 materials when purchased in furtherance of a construction

  5 24 Code that governs corporate and individual income tax and the
  5 25 franchise tax, and Code sections 15.335, 422.10, and 422.33,
  5 26 which contain references to the Internal Revenue Code for the
  5 27 state research activities credit for individuals, corporations,
  5 28 and corporations in economic development areas.
  5 29    Code section 422.9 provides individuals a deduction from
  5 30 net income for state sales and use taxes if the individual
  5 31 chose to deduct sales and use tax in lieu of state income taxes
  5 32 or the standard deduction for federal income tax purposes.
  5 33 This deduction was set to expire under both federal and Iowa
  5 34 law for tax years beginning on or after January 1, 2015.  The
  5 35 federal Protecting Americans from Tax Hikes Act of 2015 made
  6  1 the federal deduction permanent.  The bill allows the Iowa
  6  2 deduction for tax years beginning during the 2015 calendar
  6  3 year.
  6  4    The bill decouples, for Iowa income tax purposes for tax
  6  5 years ending on or after January 1, 2015, but before January
  6  6 1, 2016, from the federal additional first=year depreciation
  6  7 allowance in section 168(k) of the Internal Revenue Code
  6  8 (bonus depreciation) which was modified and extended through
  6  9 2019 by the federal Protecting Americans from Tax Hikes Act
  6 10 of 2015.  Taxpayers who claim bonus depreciation for federal
  6 11 tax purposes are, for the applicable tax year, required to add
  6 12 such depreciation amounts back to Iowa net income, but are
  6 13 then allowed under existing state law to deduct the amount of
  6 14 depreciation that would otherwise be allowable under federal
  6 15 law, without regard to the bonus depreciation allowance.
  6 16    Under current law, taxpayers are in some instances required,
  6 17 when calculating alternative minimum tax under Code section
  6 18 422.5(2) and itemized deductions under Code section 422.9(2),
  6 19 to recompute their federal adjusted gross income to take
  6 20 into account the fact that Iowa has decoupled from bonus
  6 21 depreciation.  The bill provides that taxpayers must make those
  6 22 same adjustments to federal adjusted gross income for tax year
  6 23 2015 to account for the fact that Iowa has decoupled from bonus
  6 24 depreciation as described above.
  6 25    The division takes effect upon enactment and applies
  6 26 retroactively to January 1, 2015.
  6 27    DIVISION II ==== SALES AND USE TAXES.  The bill rescinds
  6 28 several administrative rules and amendments to administrative
  6 29 rules of the department of revenue relating to the
  6 30 manufacturing sales and use tax exemptions under Code sections
  6 31 423.3(47) and 423.3(48) for the purchase of certain items used
  6 32 in manufacturing, research and development, data processing
  6 33 or storage, or recycling activities, and for the purchase of
  6 34 certain design and installation services related to machinery
  6 35 and equipment, and to the definitions of several applicable
  7  1 terms, including but not limited to definitions for tax=exempt
  7  2 "computers", "machinery", "equipment", "replacement parts",
  7  3 and "materials used to construct or self=construct computers,
  7  4 machinery, and equipment".  These administrative rules and
  7  5 amendments to administrative rules also concern the treatment
  7  6 of these tax=exempt items as they relate to the taxation of
  7  7 construction activities under Code sections 423.2(1)(b) and
  7  8 423.2(1)(c) by amending the method for determining whether
  7  9 the items are considered real property and taxed as building
  7 10 materials when purchased in furtherance of a construction
  7 11 contract, or considered tangible personal property eligible for
  7 12 the manufacturing sales and use tax exemptions.
  7 13    The effect of rescinding the amendments to these
  7 14 administrative rules is to restore the language of the
  7 15 affected rules to that as it existed prior to the date
  7 16 the adopted amendments to the rules were published in the
  7 17 Iowa administrative bulletin.  The bill directs the Iowa
  7 18 administrative code editor to restore the text of the affected
  7 19 rules to the language that existed on January 5, 2016, which
  7 20 was the day before the amendments were published in the
  7 21 Iowa administrative bulletin.  The bill also directs the
  7 22 Iowa administrative code editor to remove language of the
  7 23 rescinded rules from the Iowa administrative code. The Iowa
  7 24 administrative code editor is required to complete these
  7 25 actions as soon as practicable.  The provisions rescinding
  7 26 these administrative rules and amendments to administrative
  7 27 rules and requiring certain administrative code editor actions
  7 28 take effect upon enactment.
  7 29    The bill amends the sales tax exemption in Code section
  7 30 423.3(47) for the purchase or rental of certain items used in
  7 31 manufacturing, research and development, data processing or
  7 32 storage, or recycling activities.
  7 33    Under current law, the exemption includes replacement
  7 34 parts. The bill amends the exemption to include materials
  7 35 used to construct or self=construct replacement parts. The
  8  1 bill defines "replacement part" for purposes of the exemption
  8  2 to mean tangible personal property other than computers,
  8  3 machinery, equipment, or supplies, regardless of the cost or
  8  4 useful life of the property, that replaces a component of a
  8  5 computer, machinery, or equipment, performs the same or similar
  8  6 function as that component, and restores or improves the
  8  7 computer, machinery, or equipment.
  8  8    The bill also amends the exemption to include supplies
  8  9 and materials used to construct or self=construct supplies.
  8 10 "Supplies" is defined in the bill as tangible personal property
  8 11 that is not a computer, machinery, equipment, or replacement
  8 12 part and that meets one of the following four conditions:
  8 13    1.  The tangible personal property is to be connected to
  8 14 a computer, machinery, or equipment and requires regular
  8 15 replacement because it is consumed or deteriorates during use.
  8 16 The bill lists saw blades, drill bits, filters, and other
  8 17 similar items with a short useful life as examples.
  8 18    2.  The tangible personal property is used in conjunction
  8 19 with a computer, machinery, or equipment and is specially
  8 20 designed for use in manufacturing specific products and may
  8 21 be used interchangeably and intermittently on a particular
  8 22 computer, machine, or piece of equipment.  The bill lists jigs,
  8 23 dies, tools, and other similar items as examples.
  8 24    3.  The tangible personal property comes into physical
  8 25 contact with other tangible personal property used in
  8 26 processing and is used to assist with or maintain conditions
  8 27 necessary for processing.  The bill lists cutting fluids, oils,
  8 28 coolants, lubricants, and other similar items with a short
  8 29 useful life as examples.
  8 30    4. The tangible property is directly and primarily used
  8 31 in an activity described in Code section 423.3(47)(a)(1)=(6).
  8 32 The bill lists prototype materials and testing materials as
  8 33 examples.
  8 34    By operation of Code section 423.6, an item exempt from the
  8 35 imposition of the sales tax is also exempt from the use tax
  9  1 imposed in Code section 423.5.>

  5 13 provides that notwithstanding several Code provisions as
  5 14 specified in the bill, the definitions of "Internal Revenue
  5 15 Code" in those Code provisions and, by internal reference,
  5 16 in other sections of the Iowa Code and Iowa Acts shall mean
  5 17 the Internal Revenue Code in effect on, or as amended to and
  5 18 including, January 1, 2016.  This definition change applies
  5 19 only to the period beginning January 1, 2015, and ending
  5 20 December 31, 2015, and for tax years beginning during the 2015
  5 21 calendar year.
  5 22    The affected Code provisions include Code sections 422.3
  5 23 and 422.32, general definition sections in the chapter of the
  5 24 Code that governs corporate and individual income tax and the
  5 25 franchise tax, and Code sections 15.335, 422.10, and 422.33,
  5 26 which contain references to the Internal Revenue Code for the
  5 27 state research activities credit for individuals, corporations,
  5 28 and corporations in economic development areas.
  5 29    Code section 422.9 provides individuals a deduction from
  5 30 net income for state sales and use taxes if the individual
  5 31 chose to deduct sales and use tax in lieu of state income taxes
  5 32 or the standard deduction for federal income tax purposes.
  5 33 This deduction was set to expire under both federal and Iowa
  5 34 law for tax years beginning on or after January 1, 2015.  The
  5 35 federal Protecting Americans from Tax Hikes Act of 2015 made
  6  1 the federal deduction permanent.  The bill allows the Iowa
  6  2 deduction for tax years beginning during the 2015 calendar
  6  3 year.
  6  4    The bill decouples, for Iowa income tax purposes for tax
  6  5 years ending on or after January 1, 2015, but before January
  6  6 1, 2016, from the federal additional first=year depreciation
  6  7 allowance in section 168(k) of the Internal Revenue Code
  6  8 (bonus depreciation) which was modified and extended through
  6  9 2019 by the federal Protecting Americans from Tax Hikes Act
  6 10 of 2015.  Taxpayers who claim bonus depreciation for federal
  6 11 tax purposes are, for the applicable tax year, required to add
  6 12 such depreciation amounts back to Iowa net income, but are
  6 13 then allowed under existing state law to deduct the amount of
  6 14 depreciation that would otherwise be allowable under federal
  6 15 law, without regard to the bonus depreciation allowance.
  6 16    Under current law, taxpayers are in some instances required,
  6 17 when calculating alternative minimum tax under Code section
  6 18 422.5(2) and itemized deductions under Code section 422.9(2),
  6 19 to recompute their federal adjusted gross income to take
  6 20 into account the fact that Iowa has decoupled from bonus
  6 21 depreciation.  The bill provides that taxpayers must make those
  6 22 same adjustments to federal adjusted gross income for tax year
  6 23 2015 to account for the fact that Iowa has decoupled from bonus
  6 24 depreciation as described above.
  6 25    The division takes effect upon enactment and applies
  6 26 retroactively to January 1, 2015.
  6 27    DIVISION II ==== SALES AND USE TAXES.  The bill rescinds
  6 28 several administrative rules and amendments to administrative
  6 29 rules of the department of revenue relating to the
  6 30 manufacturing sales and use tax exemptions under Code sections
  6 31 423.3(47) and 423.3(48) for the purchase of certain items used
  6 32 in manufacturing, research and development, data processing
  6 33 or storage, or recycling activities, and for the purchase of
  6 34 certain design and installation services related to machinery
  6 35 and equipment, and to the definitions of several applicable
  7  1 terms, including but not limited to definitions for tax=exempt
  7  2 "computers", "machinery", "equipment", "replacement parts",
  7  3 and "materials used to construct or self=construct computers,
  7  4 machinery, and equipment".  These administrative rules and
  7  5 amendments to administrative rules also concern the treatment
  7  6 of these tax=exempt items as they relate to the taxation of
  7  7 construction activities under Code sections 423.2(1)(b) and
  7  8 423.2(1)(c) by amending the method for determining whether
  7  9 the items are considered real property and taxed as building
  7 10 materials when purchased in furtherance of a construction
  7 11 contract, or considered tangible personal property eligible for
  7 12 the manufacturing sales and use tax exemptions.
  7 13    The effect of rescinding the amendments to these
  7 14 administrative rules is to restore the language of the
  7 15 affected rules to that as it existed prior to the date
  7 16 the adopted amendments to the rules were published in the
  7 17 Iowa administrative bulletin.  The bill directs the Iowa
  7 18 administrative code editor to restore the text of the affected
  7 19 rules to the language that existed on January 5, 2016, which
  7 20 was the day before the amendments were published in the
  7 21 Iowa administrative bulletin.  The bill also directs the
  7 22 Iowa administrative code editor to remove language of the
  7 23 rescinded rules from the Iowa administrative code. The Iowa
  7 24 administrative code editor is required to complete these
  7 25 actions as soon as practicable.  The provisions rescinding
  7 26 these administrative rules and amendments to administrative
  7 27 rules and requiring certain administrative code editor actions
  7 28 take effect upon enactment.
  7 29    The bill amends the sales tax exemption in Code section
  7 30 423.3(47) for the purchase or rental of certain items used in
  7 31 manufacturing, research and development, data processing or
  7 32 storage, or recycling activities.
  7 33    Under current law, the exemption includes replacement
  7 34 parts. The bill amends the exemption to include materials
  7 35 used to construct or self=construct replacement parts. The
  8  1 bill defines "replacement part" for purposes of the exemption
  8  2 to mean tangible personal property other than computers,
  8  3 machinery, equipment, or supplies, regardless of the cost or
  8  4 useful life of the property, that replaces a component of a
  8  5 computer, machinery, or equipment, performs the same or similar
  8  6 function as that component, and restores or improves the
  8  7 computer, machinery, or equipment.
  8  8    The bill also amends the exemption to include supplies
  8  9 and materials used to construct or self=construct supplies.
  8 10 "Supplies" is defined in the bill as tangible personal property
  8 11 that is not a computer, machinery, equipment, or replacement
  8 12 part and that meets one of the following four conditions:
  8 13    1.  The tangible personal property is to be connected to
  8 14 a computer, machinery, or equipment and requires regular
  8 15 replacement because it is consumed or deteriorates during use.
  8 16 The bill lists saw blades, drill bits, filters, and other
  8 17 similar items with a short useful life as examples.
  8 18    2.  The tangible personal property is used in conjunction
  8 19 with a computer, machinery, or equipment and is specially
  8 20 designed for use in manufacturing specific products and may
  8 21 be used interchangeably and intermittently on a particular
  8 22 computer, machine, or piece of equipment.  The bill lists jigs,
  8 23 dies, tools, and other similar items as examples.
  8 24    3.  The tangible personal property comes into physical
  8 25 contact with other tangible personal property used in
  8 26 processing and is used to assist with or maintain conditions
  8 27 necessary for processing.  The bill lists cutting fluids, oils,
  8 28 coolants, lubricants, and other similar items with a short
  8 29 useful life as examples.
  8 30    4. The tangible property is directly and primarily used
  8 31 in an activity described in Code section 423.3(47)(a)(1)=(6).
  8 32 The bill lists prototype materials and testing materials as
  8 33 examples.
  8 34    By operation of Code section 423.6, an item exempt from the
  8 35 imposition of the sales tax is also exempt from the use tax
  9  1 imposed in Code section 423.5.>

  5 11    This bill relates to state taxation.
  5 12    DIVISION I ==== INTERNAL REVENUE CODE REFERENCES.  The bill
  5 13 provides that notwithstanding several Code provisions as
  5 14 specified in the bill, the definitions of "Internal Revenue
  5 15 Code" in those Code provisions and, by internal reference,
  5 16 in other sections of the Iowa Code and Iowa Acts shall mean
  5 17 the Internal Revenue Code in effect on, or as amended to and
  5 18 including, January 1, 2016.  This definition change applies
  5 19 only to the period beginning January 1, 2015, and ending
  5 20 December 31, 2015, and for tax years beginning during the 2015
  5 21 calendar year.
  5 22    The affected Code provisions include Code sections 422.3
  5 23 and 422.32, general definition sections in the chapter of the
  5 24 Code that governs corporate and individual income tax and the
  5 25 franchise tax, and Code sections 15.335, 422.10, and 422.33,
  5 26 which contain references to the Internal Revenue Code for the
  5 27 state research activities credit for individuals, corporations,
  5 28 and corporations in economic development areas.
  5 29    Code section 422.9 provides individuals a deduction from
  5 30 net income for state sales and use taxes if the individual
  5 31 chose to deduct sales and use tax in lieu of state income taxes
  5 32 or the standard deduction for federal income tax purposes.
  5 33 This deduction was set to expire under both federal and Iowa
  5 34 law for tax years beginning on or after January 1, 2015.  The
  5 35 federal Protecting Americans from Tax Hikes Act of 2015 made
  6  1 the federal deduction permanent.  The bill allows the Iowa
  6  2 deduction for tax years beginning during the 2015 calendar
  6  3 year.
  6  4    The bill decouples, for Iowa income tax purposes for tax
  6  5 years ending on or after January 1, 2015, but before January
  6  6 1, 2016, from the federal additional first=year depreciation
  6  7 allowance in section 168(k) of the Internal Revenue Code
  6  8 (bonus depreciation) which was modified and extended through
  6  9 2019 by the federal Protecting Americans from Tax Hikes Act
  6 10 of 2015.  Taxpayers who claim bonus depreciation for federal
  6 11 tax purposes are, for the applicable tax year, required to add
  6 12 such depreciation amounts back to Iowa net income, but are
  6 13 then allowed under existing state law to deduct the amount of
  6 14 depreciation that would otherwise be allowable under federal
  6 15 law, without regard to the bonus depreciation allowance.
  6 16    Under current law, taxpayers are in some instances required,
  6 17 when calculating alternative minimum tax under Code section
  6 18 422.5(2) and itemized deductions under Code section 422.9(2),
  6 19 to recompute their federal adjusted gross income to take
  6 20 into account the fact that Iowa has decoupled from bonus
  6 21 depreciation.  The bill provides that taxpayers must make those
  6 22 same adjustments to federal adjusted gross income for tax year
  6 23 2015 to account for the fact that Iowa has decoupled from bonus
  6 24 depreciation as described above.
  6 25    The division takes effect upon enactment and applies
  6 26 retroactively to January 1, 2015.
  6 27    DIVISION II ==== SALES AND USE TAXES.  The bill rescinds
  6 28 several administrative rules and amendments to administrative
  6 29 rules of the department of revenue relating to the
  6 30 manufacturing sales and use tax exemptions under Code sections
  6 31 423.3(47) and 423.3(48) for the purchase of certain items used
  6 32 in manufacturing, research and development, data processing
  6 33 or storage, or recycling activities, and for the purchase of
  6 34 certain design and installation services related to machinery
  6 35 and equipment, and to the definitions of several applicable
  7  1 terms, including but not limited to definitions for tax=exempt
  7  2 "computers", "machinery", "equipment", "replacement parts",
  7  3 and "materials used to construct or self=construct computers,
  7  4 machinery, and equipment".  These administrative rules and
  7  5 amendments to administrative rules also concern the treatment
  7  6 of these tax=exempt items as they relate to the taxation of
  7  7 construction activities under Code sections 423.2(1)(b) and
  7  8 423.2(1)(c) by amending the method for determining whether
  7  9 the items are considered real property and taxed as building
  7 10 materials when purchased in furtherance of a construction
  7 11 contract, or considered tangible personal property eligible for
  7 12 the manufacturing sales and use tax exemptions.
  7 13    The effect of rescinding the amendments to these
  7 14 administrative rules is to restore the language of the
  7 15 affected rules to that as it existed prior to the date
  7 16 the adopted amendments to the rules were published in the
  7 17 Iowa administrative bulletin.  The bill directs the Iowa
  7 18 administrative code editor to restore the text of the affected
  7 19 rules to the language that existed on January 5, 2016, which
  7 20 was the day before the amendments were published in the
  7 21 Iowa administrative bulletin.  The bill also directs the
  7 22 Iowa administrative code editor to remove language of the
  7 23 rescinded rules from the Iowa administrative code. The Iowa
  7 24 administrative code editor is required to complete these
  7 25 actions as soon as practicable.  The provisions rescinding
  7 26 these administrative rules and amendments to administrative
  7 27 rules and requiring certain administrative code editor actions
  7 28 take effect upon enactment.
  7 29    The bill amends the sales tax exemption in Code section
  7 30 423.3(47) for the purchase or rental of certain items used in
  7 31 manufacturing, research and development, data processing or
  7 32 storage, or recycling activities.
  7 33    Under current law, the exemption includes replacement
  7 34 parts. The bill amends the exemption to include materials
  7 35 used to construct or self=construct replacement parts. The
  8  1 bill defines "replacement part" for purposes of the exemption
  8  2 to mean tangible personal property other than computers,
  8  3 machinery, equipment, or supplies, regardless of the cost or
  8  4 useful life of the property, that replaces a component of a
  8  5 computer, machinery, or equipment, performs the same or similar
  8  6 function as that component, and restores or improves the
  8  7 computer, machinery, or equipment.
  8  8    The bill also amends the exemption to include supplies
  8  9 and materials used to construct or self=construct supplies.
  8 10 "Supplies" is defined in the bill as tangible personal property
  8 11 that is not a computer, machinery, equipment, or replacement
  8 12 part and that meets one of the following four conditions:
  8 13    1.  The tangible personal property is to be connected to
  8 14 a computer, machinery, or equipment and requires regular
  8 15 replacement because it is consumed or deteriorates during use.
  8 16 The bill lists saw blades, drill bits, filters, and other
  8 17 similar items with a short useful life as examples.
  8 18    2.  The tangible personal property is used in conjunction
  8 19 with a computer, machinery, or equipment and is specially
  8 20 designed for use in manufacturing specific products and may
  8 21 be used interchangeably and intermittently on a particular
  8 22 computer, machine, or piece of equipment.  The bill lists jigs,
  8 23 dies, tools, and other similar items as examples.
  8 24    3.  The tangible personal property comes into physical
  8 25 contact with other tangible personal property used in
  8 26 processing and is used to assist with or maintain conditions
  8 27 necessary for processing.  The bill lists cutting fluids, oils,
  8 28 coolants, lubricants, and other similar items with a short
  8 29 useful life as examples.
  8 30    4. The tangible property is directly and primarily used
  8 31 in an activity described in Code section 423.3(47)(a)(1)=(6).
  8 32 The bill lists prototype materials and testing materials as
  8 33 examples.
  8 34    By operation of Code section 423.6, an item exempt from the
  8 35 imposition of the sales tax is also exempt from the use tax
  9  1 imposed in Code section 423.5.>

  5 12    DIVISION I ==== INTERNAL REVENUE CODE REFERENCES.  The bill
  5 13 provides that notwithstanding several Code provisions as
  5 14 specified in the bill, the definitions of "Internal Revenue
  5 15 Code" in those Code provisions and, by internal reference,
  5 16 in other sections of the Iowa Code and Iowa Acts shall mean
  5 17 the Internal Revenue Code in effect on, or as amended to and
  5 18 including, January 1, 2016.  This definition change applies
  5 19 only to the period beginning January 1, 2015, and ending
  5 20 December 31, 2015, and for tax years beginning during the 2015
  5 21 calendar year.
  5 22    The affected Code provisions include Code sections 422.3
  5 23 and 422.32, general definition sections in the chapter of the
  5 24 Code that governs corporate and individual income tax and the
  5 25 franchise tax, and Code sections 15.335, 422.10, and 422.33,
  5 26 which contain references to the Internal Revenue Code for the
  5 27 state research activities credit for individuals, corporations,

  5 29    Code section 422.9 provides individuals a deduction from
  5 30 net income for state sales and use taxes if the individual
  5 31 chose to deduct sales and use tax in lieu of state income taxes
  5 32 or the standard deduction for federal income tax purposes.
  5 33 This deduction was set to expire under both federal and Iowa
  5 34 law for tax years beginning on or after January 1, 2015.  The
  5 35 federal Protecting Americans from Tax Hikes Act of 2015 made
  6  1 the federal deduction permanent.  The bill allows the Iowa
  6  2 deduction for tax years beginning during the 2015 calendar
  6  3 year.
  6  4    The bill decouples, for Iowa income tax purposes for tax
  6  5 years ending on or after January 1, 2015, but before January
  6  6 1, 2016, from the federal additional first=year depreciation
  6  7 allowance in section 168(k) of the Internal Revenue Code
  6  8 (bonus depreciation) which was modified and extended through
  6  9 2019 by the federal Protecting Americans from Tax Hikes Act
  6 10 of 2015.  Taxpayers who claim bonus depreciation for federal
  6 11 tax purposes are, for the applicable tax year, required to add
  6 12 such depreciation amounts back to Iowa net income, but are
  6 13 then allowed under existing state law to deduct the amount of
  6 14 depreciation that would otherwise be allowable under federal
  6 15 law, without regard to the bonus depreciation allowance.
  6 16    Under current law, taxpayers are in some instances required,

  6 21 depreciation.  The bill provides that taxpayers must make those
  6 22 same adjustments to federal adjusted gross income for tax year
  6 23 2015 to account for the fact that Iowa has decoupled from bonus
  6 24 depreciation as described above.

  6 32 in manufacturing, research and development, data processing
  6 33 or storage, or recycling activities, and for the purchase of

  7  2 "computers", "machinery", "equipment", "replacement parts",
  7  3 and "materials used to construct or self=construct computers,
  7  4 machinery, and equipment".  These administrative rules and
  7  5 amendments to administrative rules also concern the treatment
  7  6 of these tax=exempt items as they relate to the taxation of
  7  7 construction activities under Code sections 423.2(1)(b) and
  7  8 423.2(1)(c) by amending the method for determining whether
  7  9 the items are considered real property and taxed as building
  7 10 materials when purchased in furtherance of a construction
  7 11 contract, or considered tangible personal property eligible for
  7 12 the manufacturing sales and use tax exemptions.

  5 19 only to the period beginning January 1, 2015, and ending
  5 20 December 31, 2015, and for tax years beginning during the 2015
  5 21 calendar year.
  5 22    The affected Code provisions include Code sections 422.3
  5 23 and 422.32, general definition sections in the chapter of the
  5 24 Code that governs corporate and individual income tax and the
  5 25 franchise tax, and Code sections 15.335, 422.10, and 422.33,
  5 26 which contain references to the Internal Revenue Code for the
  5 27 state research activities credit for individuals, corporations,
  5 28 and corporations in economic development areas.
  5 29    Code section 422.9 provides individuals a deduction from
  5 30 net income for state sales and use taxes if the individual
  5 31 chose to deduct sales and use tax in lieu of state income taxes
  5 32 or the standard deduction for federal income tax purposes.
  5 33 This deduction was set to expire under both federal and Iowa
  5 34 law for tax years beginning on or after January 1, 2015.  The
  5 35 federal Protecting Americans from Tax Hikes Act of 2015 made
  6  1 the federal deduction permanent.  The bill allows the Iowa
  6  2 deduction for tax years beginning during the 2015 calendar
  6  3 year.
  6  4    The bill decouples, for Iowa income tax purposes for tax
  6  5 years ending on or after January 1, 2015, but before January
  6  6 1, 2016, from the federal additional first=year depreciation
  6  7 allowance in section 168(k) of the Internal Revenue Code
  6  8 (bonus depreciation) which was modified and extended through
  6  9 2019 by the federal Protecting Americans from Tax Hikes Act
  6 10 of 2015.  Taxpayers who claim bonus depreciation for federal
  6 11 tax purposes are, for the applicable tax year, required to add
  6 12 such depreciation amounts back to Iowa net income, but are
  6 13 then allowed under existing state law to deduct the amount of
  6 14 depreciation that would otherwise be allowable under federal
  6 15 law, without regard to the bonus depreciation allowance.
  6 16    Under current law, taxpayers are in some instances required,
  6 17 when calculating alternative minimum tax under Code section
  6 18 422.5(2) and itemized deductions under Code section 422.9(2),
  6 19 to recompute their federal adjusted gross income to take
  6 20 into account the fact that Iowa has decoupled from bonus
  6 21 depreciation.  The bill provides that taxpayers must make those
  6 22 same adjustments to federal adjusted gross income for tax year
  6 23 2015 to account for the fact that Iowa has decoupled from bonus
  6 24 depreciation as described above.
  6 25    The division takes effect upon enactment and applies
  6 26 retroactively to January 1, 2015.
  6 27    DIVISION II ==== SALES AND USE TAXES.  The bill rescinds
  6 28 several administrative rules and amendments to administrative
  6 29 rules of the department of revenue relating to the
  6 30 manufacturing sales and use tax exemptions under Code sections
  6 31 423.3(47) and 423.3(48) for the purchase of certain items used
  6 32 in manufacturing, research and development, data processing
  6 33 or storage, or recycling activities, and for the purchase of
  6 34 certain design and installation services related to machinery
  6 35 and equipment, and to the definitions of several applicable
  7  1 terms, including but not limited to definitions for tax=exempt
  7  2 "computers", "machinery", "equipment", "replacement parts",
  7  3 and "materials used to construct or self=construct computers,
  7  4 machinery, and equipment".  These administrative rules and
  7  5 amendments to administrative rules also concern the treatment
  7  6 of these tax=exempt items as they relate to the taxation of
  7  7 construction activities under Code sections 423.2(1)(b) and
  7  8 423.2(1)(c) by amending the method for determining whether
  7  9 the items are considered real property and taxed as building
  7 10 materials when purchased in furtherance of a construction
  7 11 contract, or considered tangible personal property eligible for
  7 12 the manufacturing sales and use tax exemptions.
  7 13    The effect of rescinding the amendments to these
  7 14 administrative rules is to restore the language of the
  7 15 affected rules to that as it existed prior to the date
  7 16 the adopted amendments to the rules were published in the
  7 17 Iowa administrative bulletin.  The bill directs the Iowa
  7 18 administrative code editor to restore the text of the affected
  7 19 rules to the language that existed on January 5, 2016, which
  7 20 was the day before the amendments were published in the
  7 21 Iowa administrative bulletin.  The bill also directs the
  7 22 Iowa administrative code editor to remove language of the
  7 23 rescinded rules from the Iowa administrative code. The Iowa
  7 24 administrative code editor is required to complete these
  7 25 actions as soon as practicable.  The provisions rescinding
  7 26 these administrative rules and amendments to administrative
  7 27 rules and requiring certain administrative code editor actions
  7 28 take effect upon enactment.
  7 29    The bill amends the sales tax exemption in Code section
  7 30 423.3(47) for the purchase or rental of certain items used in
  7 31 manufacturing, research and development, data processing or
  7 32 storage, or recycling activities.
  7 33    Under current law, the exemption includes replacement
  7 34 parts. The bill amends the exemption to include materials
  7 35 used to construct or self=construct replacement parts. The
  8  1 bill defines "replacement part" for purposes of the exemption
  8  2 to mean tangible personal property other than computers,
  8  3 machinery, equipment, or supplies, regardless of the cost or
  8  4 useful life of the property, that replaces a component of a
  8  5 computer, machinery, or equipment, performs the same or similar
  8  6 function as that component, and restores or improves the
  8  7 computer, machinery, or equipment.
  8  8    The bill also amends the exemption to include supplies
  8  9 and materials used to construct or self=construct supplies.
  8 10 "Supplies" is defined in the bill as tangible personal property
  8 11 that is not a computer, machinery, equipment, or replacement
  8 12 part and that meets one of the following four conditions:
  8 13    1.  The tangible personal property is to be connected to
  8 14 a computer, machinery, or equipment and requires regular
  8 15 replacement because it is consumed or deteriorates during use.
  8 16 The bill lists saw blades, drill bits, filters, and other
  8 17 similar items with a short useful life as examples.
  8 18    2.  The tangible personal property is used in conjunction
  8 19 with a computer, machinery, or equipment and is specially
  8 20 designed for use in manufacturing specific products and may
  8 21 be used interchangeably and intermittently on a particular
  8 22 computer, machine, or piece of equipment.  The bill lists jigs,
  8 23 dies, tools, and other similar items as examples.
  8 24    3.  The tangible personal property comes into physical
  8 25 contact with other tangible personal property used in
  8 26 processing and is used to assist with or maintain conditions
  8 27 necessary for processing.  The bill lists cutting fluids, oils,
  8 28 coolants, lubricants, and other similar items with a short
  8 29 useful life as examples.
  8 30    4. The tangible property is directly and primarily used
  8 31 in an activity described in Code section 423.3(47)(a)(1)=(6).
  8 32 The bill lists prototype materials and testing materials as
  8 33 examples.
  8 34    By operation of Code section 423.6, an item exempt from the
  8 35 imposition of the sales tax is also exempt from the use tax
  9  1 imposed in Code section 423.5.>

  5 34 law for tax years beginning on or after January 1, 2015.  The
  5 35 federal Protecting Americans from Tax Hikes Act of 2015 made
  6  1 the federal deduction permanent.  The bill allows the Iowa
  6  2 deduction for tax years beginning during the 2015 calendar
  6  3 year.
  6  4    The bill decouples, for Iowa income tax purposes for tax
  6  5 years ending on or after January 1, 2015, but before January
  6  6 1, 2016, from the federal additional first=year depreciation
  6  7 allowance in section 168(k) of the Internal Revenue Code
  6  8 (bonus depreciation) which was modified and extended through
  6  9 2019 by the federal Protecting Americans from Tax Hikes Act
  6 10 of 2015.  Taxpayers who claim bonus depreciation for federal
  6 11 tax purposes are, for the applicable tax year, required to add
  6 12 such depreciation amounts back to Iowa net income, but are
  6 13 then allowed under existing state law to deduct the amount of
  6 14 depreciation that would otherwise be allowable under federal
  6 15 law, without regard to the bonus depreciation allowance.
  6 16    Under current law, taxpayers are in some instances required,
  6 17 when calculating alternative minimum tax under Code section
  6 18 422.5(2) and itemized deductions under Code section 422.9(2),
  6 19 to recompute their federal adjusted gross income to take
  6 20 into account the fact that Iowa has decoupled from bonus
  6 21 depreciation.  The bill provides that taxpayers must make those
  6 22 same adjustments to federal adjusted gross income for tax year
  6 23 2015 to account for the fact that Iowa has decoupled from bonus
  6 24 depreciation as described above.
  6 25    The division takes effect upon enactment and applies
  6 26 retroactively to January 1, 2015.
  6 27    DIVISION II ==== SALES AND USE TAXES.  The bill rescinds
  6 28 several administrative rules and amendments to administrative
  6 29 rules of the department of revenue relating to the
  6 30 manufacturing sales and use tax exemptions under Code sections
  6 31 423.3(47) and 423.3(48) for the purchase of certain items used
  6 32 in manufacturing, research and development, data processing
  6 33 or storage, or recycling activities, and for the purchase of
  6 34 certain design and installation services related to machinery
  6 35 and equipment, and to the definitions of several applicable
  7  1 terms, including but not limited to definitions for tax=exempt
  7  2 "computers", "machinery", "equipment", "replacement parts",
  7  3 and "materials used to construct or self=construct computers,
  7  4 machinery, and equipment".  These administrative rules and
  7  5 amendments to administrative rules also concern the treatment
  7  6 of these tax=exempt items as they relate to the taxation of
  7  7 construction activities under Code sections 423.2(1)(b) and
  7  8 423.2(1)(c) by amending the method for determining whether
  7  9 the items are considered real property and taxed as building
  7 10 materials when purchased in furtherance of a construction
  7 11 contract, or considered tangible personal property eligible for
  7 12 the manufacturing sales and use tax exemptions.
  7 13    The effect of rescinding the amendments to these
  7 14 administrative rules is to restore the language of the
  7 15 affected rules to that as it existed prior to the date
  7 16 the adopted amendments to the rules were published in the
  7 17 Iowa administrative bulletin.  The bill directs the Iowa
  7 18 administrative code editor to restore the text of the affected
  7 19 rules to the language that existed on January 5, 2016, which
  7 20 was the day before the amendments were published in the
  7 21 Iowa administrative bulletin.  The bill also directs the
  7 22 Iowa administrative code editor to remove language of the
  7 23 rescinded rules from the Iowa administrative code. The Iowa
  7 24 administrative code editor is required to complete these
  7 25 actions as soon as practicable.  The provisions rescinding

  7 27 rules and requiring certain administrative code editor actions

  7 30 423.3(47) for the purchase or rental of certain items used in
  7 31 manufacturing, research and development, data processing or
  7 32 storage, or recycling activities.
  7 33    Under current law, the exemption includes replacement
  7 34 parts. The bill amends the exemption to include materials
  7 35 used to construct or self=construct replacement parts. The
  8  1 bill defines "replacement part" for purposes of the exemption
  8  2 to mean tangible personal property other than computers,
  8  3 machinery, equipment, or supplies, regardless of the cost or
  8  4 useful life of the property, that replaces a component of a
  8  5 computer, machinery, or equipment, performs the same or similar
  8  6 function as that component, and restores or improves the
  8  7 computer, machinery, or equipment.
  8  8    The bill also amends the exemption to include supplies
  8  9 and materials used to construct or self=construct supplies.
  8 10 "Supplies" is defined in the bill as tangible personal property
  8 11 that is not a computer, machinery, equipment, or replacement
  8 12 part and that meets one of the following four conditions:
  8 13    1.  The tangible personal property is to be connected to
  8 14 a computer, machinery, or equipment and requires regular
  8 15 replacement because it is consumed or deteriorates during use.
  8 16 The bill lists saw blades, drill bits, filters, and other
  8 17 similar items with a short useful life as examples.
  8 18    2.  The tangible personal property is used in conjunction
  8 19 with a computer, machinery, or equipment and is specially
  8 20 designed for use in manufacturing specific products and may
  8 21 be used interchangeably and intermittently on a particular
  8 22 computer, machine, or piece of equipment.  The bill lists jigs,
  8 23 dies, tools, and other similar items as examples.
  8 24    3.  The tangible personal property comes into physical
  8 25 contact with other tangible personal property used in
  8 26 processing and is used to assist with or maintain conditions
  8 27 necessary for processing.  The bill lists cutting fluids, oils,
  8 28 coolants, lubricants, and other similar items with a short
  8 29 useful life as examples.
  8 30    4. The tangible property is directly and primarily used
  8 31 in an activity described in Code section 423.3(47)(a)(1)=(6).
  8 32 The bill lists prototype materials and testing materials as
  8 33 examples.
  8 34    By operation of Code section 423.6, an item exempt from the
  8 35 imposition of the sales tax is also exempt from the use tax
  9  1 imposed in Code section 423.5.>

  6 32 in manufacturing, research and development, data processing
  6 33 or storage, or recycling activities, and for the purchase of
  6 34 certain design and installation services related to machinery
  6 35 and equipment, and to the definitions of several applicable
  7  1 terms, including but not limited to definitions for tax=exempt
  7  2 "computers", "machinery", "equipment", "replacement parts",
  7  3 and "materials used to construct or self=construct computers,
  7  4 machinery, and equipment".  These administrative rules and
  7  5 amendments to administrative rules also concern the treatment
  7  6 of these tax=exempt items as they relate to the taxation of
  7  7 construction activities under Code sections 423.2(1)(b) and
  7  8 423.2(1)(c) by amending the method for determining whether
  7  9 the items are considered real property and taxed as building
  7 10 materials when purchased in furtherance of a construction
  7 11 contract, or considered tangible personal property eligible for
  7 12 the manufacturing sales and use tax exemptions.
  7 13    The effect of rescinding the amendments to these
  7 14 administrative rules is to restore the language of the
  7 15 affected rules to that as it existed prior to the date
  7 16 the adopted amendments to the rules were published in the

  7 22 Iowa administrative code editor to remove language of the
  7 23 rescinded rules from the Iowa administrative code. The Iowa
  7 24 administrative code editor is required to complete these
  7 25 actions as soon as practicable.  The provisions rescinding
  7 26 these administrative rules and amendments to administrative
  7 27 rules and requiring certain administrative code editor actions
  7 28 take effect upon enactment.
  7 29    The bill amends the sales tax exemption in Code section
  7 30 423.3(47) for the purchase or rental of certain items used in
  7 31 manufacturing, research and development, data processing or
  7 32 storage, or recycling activities.
  7 33    Under current law, the exemption includes replacement
  7 34 parts. The bill amends the exemption to include materials
  7 35 used to construct or self=construct replacement parts. The
  8  1 bill defines "replacement part" for purposes of the exemption
  8  2 to mean tangible personal property other than computers,
  8  3 machinery, equipment, or supplies, regardless of the cost or
  8  4 useful life of the property, that replaces a component of a
  8  5 computer, machinery, or equipment, performs the same or similar
  8  6 function as that component, and restores or improves the
  8  7 computer, machinery, or equipment.
  8  8    The bill also amends the exemption to include supplies
  8  9 and materials used to construct or self=construct supplies.
  8 10 "Supplies" is defined in the bill as tangible personal property
  8 11 that is not a computer, machinery, equipment, or replacement
  8 12 part and that meets one of the following four conditions:
  8 13    1.  The tangible personal property is to be connected to
  8 14 a computer, machinery, or equipment and requires regular
  8 15 replacement because it is consumed or deteriorates during use.
  8 16 The bill lists saw blades, drill bits, filters, and other
  8 17 similar items with a short useful life as examples.
  8 18    2.  The tangible personal property is used in conjunction
  8 19 with a computer, machinery, or equipment and is specially
  8 20 designed for use in manufacturing specific products and may
  8 21 be used interchangeably and intermittently on a particular
  8 22 computer, machine, or piece of equipment.  The bill lists jigs,
  8 23 dies, tools, and other similar items as examples.
  8 24    3.  The tangible personal property comes into physical
  8 25 contact with other tangible personal property used in
  8 26 processing and is used to assist with or maintain conditions
  8 27 necessary for processing.  The bill lists cutting fluids, oils,
  8 28 coolants, lubricants, and other similar items with a short
  8 29 useful life as examples.
  8 30    4. The tangible property is directly and primarily used
  8 31 in an activity described in Code section 423.3(47)(a)(1)=(6).
  8 32 The bill lists prototype materials and testing materials as
  8 33 examples.
  8 34    By operation of Code section 423.6, an item exempt from the
  8 35 imposition of the sales tax is also exempt from the use tax
  9  1 imposed in Code section 423.5.>

  5 21 calendar year.
  5 22    The affected Code provisions include Code sections 422.3
  5 23 and 422.32, general definition sections in the chapter of the
  5 24 Code that governs corporate and individual income tax and the
  5 25 franchise tax, and Code sections 15.335, 422.10, and 422.33,
  5 26 which contain references to the Internal Revenue Code for the
  5 27 state research activities credit for individuals, corporations,
  5 28 and corporations in economic development areas.
  5 29    Code section 422.9 provides individuals a deduction from
  5 30 net income for state sales and use taxes if the individual
  5 31 chose to deduct sales and use tax in lieu of state income taxes
  5 32 or the standard deduction for federal income tax purposes.
  5 33 This deduction was set to expire under both federal and Iowa
  5 34 law for tax years beginning on or after January 1, 2015.  The
  5 35 federal Protecting Americans from Tax Hikes Act of 2015 made
  6  1 the federal deduction permanent.  The bill allows the Iowa
  6  2 deduction for tax years beginning during the 2015 calendar
  6  3 year.
  6  4    The bill decouples, for Iowa income tax purposes for tax
  6  5 years ending on or after January 1, 2015, but before January
  6  6 1, 2016, from the federal additional first=year depreciation
  6  7 allowance in section 168(k) of the Internal Revenue Code
  6  8 (bonus depreciation) which was modified and extended through
  6  9 2019 by the federal Protecting Americans from Tax Hikes Act
  6 10 of 2015.  Taxpayers who claim bonus depreciation for federal
  6 11 tax purposes are, for the applicable tax year, required to add
  6 12 such depreciation amounts back to Iowa net income, but are
  6 13 then allowed under existing state law to deduct the amount of
  6 14 depreciation that would otherwise be allowable under federal
  6 15 law, without regard to the bonus depreciation allowance.
  6 16    Under current law, taxpayers are in some instances required,
  6 17 when calculating alternative minimum tax under Code section
  6 18 422.5(2) and itemized deductions under Code section 422.9(2),
  6 19 to recompute their federal adjusted gross income to take
  6 20 into account the fact that Iowa has decoupled from bonus
  6 21 depreciation.  The bill provides that taxpayers must make those
  6 22 same adjustments to federal adjusted gross income for tax year
  6 23 2015 to account for the fact that Iowa has decoupled from bonus
  6 24 depreciation as described above.

  7  6 of these tax=exempt items as they relate to the taxation of
  7  7 construction activities under Code sections 423.2(1)(b) and
  7  8 423.2(1)(c) by amending the method for determining whether
  7  9 the items are considered real property and taxed as building
  7 10 materials when purchased in furtherance of a construction
  7 11 contract, or considered tangible personal property eligible for
  7 12 the manufacturing sales and use tax exemptions.

  7 29    The bill amends the sales tax exemption in Code section
  7 30 423.3(47) for the purchase or rental of certain items used in
  7 31 manufacturing, research and development, data processing or
  7 32 storage, or recycling activities.
  7 33    Under current law, the exemption includes replacement
  7 34 parts. The bill amends the exemption to include materials
  7 35 used to construct or self=construct replacement parts. The
  8  1 bill defines "replacement part" for purposes of the exemption
  8  2 to mean tangible personal property other than computers,
  8  3 machinery, equipment, or supplies, regardless of the cost or
  8  4 useful life of the property, that replaces a component of a
  8  5 computer, machinery, or equipment, performs the same or similar
  8  6 function as that component, and restores or improves the
  8  7 computer, machinery, or equipment.
  8  8    The bill also amends the exemption to include supplies
  8  9 and materials used to construct or self=construct supplies.
  8 10 "Supplies" is defined in the bill as tangible personal property
  8 11 that is not a computer, machinery, equipment, or replacement
  8 12 part and that meets one of the following four conditions:
  8 13    1.  The tangible personal property is to be connected to
  8 14 a computer, machinery, or equipment and requires regular
  8 15 replacement because it is consumed or deteriorates during use.
  8 16 The bill lists saw blades, drill bits, filters, and other
  8 17 similar items with a short useful life as examples.
  8 18    2.  The tangible personal property is used in conjunction
  8 19 with a computer, machinery, or equipment and is specially
  8 20 designed for use in manufacturing specific products and may
  8 21 be used interchangeably and intermittently on a particular
  8 22 computer, machine, or piece of equipment.  The bill lists jigs,
  8 23 dies, tools, and other similar items as examples.
  8 24    3.  The tangible personal property comes into physical
  8 25 contact with other tangible personal property used in
  8 26 processing and is used to assist with or maintain conditions
  8 27 necessary for processing.  The bill lists cutting fluids, oils,
  8 28 coolants, lubricants, and other similar items with a short
  8 29 useful life as examples.
  8 30    4. The tangible property is directly and primarily used
  8 31 in an activity described in Code section 423.3(47)(a)(1)=(6).
  8 32 The bill lists prototype materials and testing materials as
  8 33 examples.
  8 34    By operation of Code section 423.6, an item exempt from the
  8 35 imposition of the sales tax is also exempt from the use tax
  9  1 imposed in Code section 423.5.>

  5 22    The affected Code provisions include Code sections 422.3
  5 23 and 422.32, general definition sections in the chapter of the
  5 24 Code that governs corporate and individual income tax and the
  5 25 franchise tax, and Code sections 15.335, 422.10, and 422.33,
  5 26 which contain references to the Internal Revenue Code for the
  5 27 state research activities credit for individuals, corporations,
  5 28 and corporations in economic development areas.
  5 29    Code section 422.9 provides individuals a deduction from
  5 30 net income for state sales and use taxes if the individual
  5 31 chose to deduct sales and use tax in lieu of state income taxes
  5 32 or the standard deduction for federal income tax purposes.
  5 33 This deduction was set to expire under both federal and Iowa
  5 34 law for tax years beginning on or after January 1, 2015.  The
  5 35 federal Protecting Americans from Tax Hikes Act of 2015 made
  6  1 the federal deduction permanent.  The bill allows the Iowa
  6  2 deduction for tax years beginning during the 2015 calendar
  6  3 year.
  6  4    The bill decouples, for Iowa income tax purposes for tax
  6  5 years ending on or after January 1, 2015, but before January
  6  6 1, 2016, from the federal additional first=year depreciation
  6  7 allowance in section 168(k) of the Internal Revenue Code
  6  8 (bonus depreciation) which was modified and extended through
  6  9 2019 by the federal Protecting Americans from Tax Hikes Act
  6 10 of 2015.  Taxpayers who claim bonus depreciation for federal
  6 11 tax purposes are, for the applicable tax year, required to add
  6 12 such depreciation amounts back to Iowa net income, but are
  6 13 then allowed under existing state law to deduct the amount of
  6 14 depreciation that would otherwise be allowable under federal
  6 15 law, without regard to the bonus depreciation allowance.
  6 16    Under current law, taxpayers are in some instances required,
  6 17 when calculating alternative minimum tax under Code section
  6 18 422.5(2) and itemized deductions under Code section 422.9(2),
  6 19 to recompute their federal adjusted gross income to take
  6 20 into account the fact that Iowa has decoupled from bonus
  6 21 depreciation.  The bill provides that taxpayers must make those
  6 22 same adjustments to federal adjusted gross income for tax year
  6 23 2015 to account for the fact that Iowa has decoupled from bonus
  6 24 depreciation as described above.
  6 25    The division takes effect upon enactment and applies
  6 26 retroactively to January 1, 2015.
  6 27    DIVISION II ==== SALES AND USE TAXES.  The bill rescinds
  6 28 several administrative rules and amendments to administrative
  6 29 rules of the department of revenue relating to the
  6 30 manufacturing sales and use tax exemptions under Code sections
  6 31 423.3(47) and 423.3(48) for the purchase of certain items used
  6 32 in manufacturing, research and development, data processing
  6 33 or storage, or recycling activities, and for the purchase of
  6 34 certain design and installation services related to machinery
  6 35 and equipment, and to the definitions of several applicable
  7  1 terms, including but not limited to definitions for tax=exempt
  7  2 "computers", "machinery", "equipment", "replacement parts",
  7  3 and "materials used to construct or self=construct computers,
  7  4 machinery, and equipment".  These administrative rules and
  7  5 amendments to administrative rules also concern the treatment
  7  6 of these tax=exempt items as they relate to the taxation of
  7  7 construction activities under Code sections 423.2(1)(b) and
  7  8 423.2(1)(c) by amending the method for determining whether
  7  9 the items are considered real property and taxed as building
  7 10 materials when purchased in furtherance of a construction
  7 11 contract, or considered tangible personal property eligible for
  7 12 the manufacturing sales and use tax exemptions.
  7 13    The effect of rescinding the amendments to these
  7 14 administrative rules is to restore the language of the
  7 15 affected rules to that as it existed prior to the date
  7 16 the adopted amendments to the rules were published in the
  7 17 Iowa administrative bulletin.  The bill directs the Iowa
  7 18 administrative code editor to restore the text of the affected
  7 19 rules to the language that existed on January 5, 2016, which
  7 20 was the day before the amendments were published in the
  7 21 Iowa administrative bulletin.  The bill also directs the
  7 22 Iowa administrative code editor to remove language of the
  7 23 rescinded rules from the Iowa administrative code. The Iowa
  7 24 administrative code editor is required to complete these

  7 30 423.3(47) for the purchase or rental of certain items used in
  7 31 manufacturing, research and development, data processing or
  7 32 storage, or recycling activities.
  7 33    Under current law, the exemption includes replacement
  7 34 parts. The bill amends the exemption to include materials
  7 35 used to construct or self=construct replacement parts. The
  8  1 bill defines "replacement part" for purposes of the exemption
  8  2 to mean tangible personal property other than computers,
  8  3 machinery, equipment, or supplies, regardless of the cost or
  8  4 useful life of the property, that replaces a component of a
  8  5 computer, machinery, or equipment, performs the same or similar

  8  7 computer, machinery, or equipment.
  8  8    The bill also amends the exemption to include supplies
  8  9 and materials used to construct or self=construct supplies.
  8 10 "Supplies" is defined in the bill as tangible personal property
  8 11 that is not a computer, machinery, equipment, or replacement

  8 30    4. The tangible property is directly and primarily used
  8 31 in an activity described in Code section 423.3(47)(a)(1)=(6).
  8 32 The bill lists prototype materials and testing materials as
  8 33 examples.
  8 34    By operation of Code section 423.6, an item exempt from the
  8 35 imposition of the sales tax is also exempt from the use tax

  5 26 which contain references to the Internal Revenue Code for the
  5 27 state research activities credit for individuals, corporations,
  5 28 and corporations in economic development areas.
  5 29    Code section 422.9 provides individuals a deduction from
  5 30 net income for state sales and use taxes if the individual
  5 31 chose to deduct sales and use tax in lieu of state income taxes
  5 32 or the standard deduction for federal income tax purposes.
  5 33 This deduction was set to expire under both federal and Iowa
  5 34 law for tax years beginning on or after January 1, 2015.  The
  5 35 federal Protecting Americans from Tax Hikes Act of 2015 made
  6  1 the federal deduction permanent.  The bill allows the Iowa
  6  2 deduction for tax years beginning during the 2015 calendar
  6  3 year.
  6  4    The bill decouples, for Iowa income tax purposes for tax
  6  5 years ending on or after January 1, 2015, but before January
  6  6 1, 2016, from the federal additional first=year depreciation
  6  7 allowance in section 168(k) of the Internal Revenue Code
  6  8 (bonus depreciation) which was modified and extended through
  6  9 2019 by the federal Protecting Americans from Tax Hikes Act
  6 10 of 2015.  Taxpayers who claim bonus depreciation for federal
  6 11 tax purposes are, for the applicable tax year, required to add
  6 12 such depreciation amounts back to Iowa net income, but are
  6 13 then allowed under existing state law to deduct the amount of
  6 14 depreciation that would otherwise be allowable under federal
  6 15 law, without regard to the bonus depreciation allowance.
  6 16    Under current law, taxpayers are in some instances required,
  6 17 when calculating alternative minimum tax under Code section
  6 18 422.5(2) and itemized deductions under Code section 422.9(2),
  6 19 to recompute their federal adjusted gross income to take
  6 20 into account the fact that Iowa has decoupled from bonus
  6 21 depreciation.  The bill provides that taxpayers must make those
  6 22 same adjustments to federal adjusted gross income for tax year
  6 23 2015 to account for the fact that Iowa has decoupled from bonus
  6 24 depreciation as described above.
  6 25    The division takes effect upon enactment and applies
  6 26 retroactively to January 1, 2015.
  6 27    DIVISION II ==== SALES AND USE TAXES.  The bill rescinds
  6 28 several administrative rules and amendments to administrative
  6 29 rules of the department of revenue relating to the
  6 30 manufacturing sales and use tax exemptions under Code sections
  6 31 423.3(47) and 423.3(48) for the purchase of certain items used
  6 32 in manufacturing, research and development, data processing
  6 33 or storage, or recycling activities, and for the purchase of
  6 34 certain design and installation services related to machinery
  6 35 and equipment, and to the definitions of several applicable
  7  1 terms, including but not limited to definitions for tax=exempt
  7  2 "computers", "machinery", "equipment", "replacement parts",
  7  3 and "materials used to construct or self=construct computers,
  7  4 machinery, and equipment".  These administrative rules and
  7  5 amendments to administrative rules also concern the treatment
  7  6 of these tax=exempt items as they relate to the taxation of
  7  7 construction activities under Code sections 423.2(1)(b) and
  7  8 423.2(1)(c) by amending the method for determining whether
  7  9 the items are considered real property and taxed as building
  7 10 materials when purchased in furtherance of a construction
  7 11 contract, or considered tangible personal property eligible for
  7 12 the manufacturing sales and use tax exemptions.
  7 13    The effect of rescinding the amendments to these
  7 14 administrative rules is to restore the language of the
  7 15 affected rules to that as it existed prior to the date
  7 16 the adopted amendments to the rules were published in the
  7 17 Iowa administrative bulletin.  The bill directs the Iowa
  7 18 administrative code editor to restore the text of the affected
  7 19 rules to the language that existed on January 5, 2016, which
  7 20 was the day before the amendments were published in the
  7 21 Iowa administrative bulletin.  The bill also directs the
  7 22 Iowa administrative code editor to remove language of the
  7 23 rescinded rules from the Iowa administrative code. The Iowa
  7 24 administrative code editor is required to complete these
  7 25 actions as soon as practicable.  The provisions rescinding
  7 26 these administrative rules and amendments to administrative
  7 27 rules and requiring certain administrative code editor actions
  7 28 take effect upon enactment.
  7 29    The bill amends the sales tax exemption in Code section
  7 30 423.3(47) for the purchase or rental of certain items used in
  7 31 manufacturing, research and development, data processing or
  7 32 storage, or recycling activities.
  7 33    Under current law, the exemption includes replacement
  7 34 parts. The bill amends the exemption to include materials
  7 35 used to construct or self=construct replacement parts. The
  8  1 bill defines "replacement part" for purposes of the exemption
  8  2 to mean tangible personal property other than computers,
  8  3 machinery, equipment, or supplies, regardless of the cost or
  8  4 useful life of the property, that replaces a component of a
  8  5 computer, machinery, or equipment, performs the same or similar
  8  6 function as that component, and restores or improves the
  8  7 computer, machinery, or equipment.
  8  8    The bill also amends the exemption to include supplies
  8  9 and materials used to construct or self=construct supplies.
  8 10 "Supplies" is defined in the bill as tangible personal property
  8 11 that is not a computer, machinery, equipment, or replacement
  8 12 part and that meets one of the following four conditions:
  8 13    1.  The tangible personal property is to be connected to
  8 14 a computer, machinery, or equipment and requires regular
  8 15 replacement because it is consumed or deteriorates during use.
  8 16 The bill lists saw blades, drill bits, filters, and other
  8 17 similar items with a short useful life as examples.
  8 18    2.  The tangible personal property is used in conjunction
  8 19 with a computer, machinery, or equipment and is specially
  8 20 designed for use in manufacturing specific products and may
  8 21 be used interchangeably and intermittently on a particular
  8 22 computer, machine, or piece of equipment.  The bill lists jigs,
  8 23 dies, tools, and other similar items as examples.
  8 24    3.  The tangible personal property comes into physical
  8 25 contact with other tangible personal property used in
  8 26 processing and is used to assist with or maintain conditions
  8 27 necessary for processing.  The bill lists cutting fluids, oils,
  8 28 coolants, lubricants, and other similar items with a short
  8 29 useful life as examples.
  8 30    4. The tangible property is directly and primarily used
  8 31 in an activity described in Code section 423.3(47)(a)(1)=(6).
  8 32 The bill lists prototype materials and testing materials as
  8 33 examples.
  8 34    By operation of Code section 423.6, an item exempt from the
  8 35 imposition of the sales tax is also exempt from the use tax

  6 12 such depreciation amounts back to Iowa net income, but are
  6 13 then allowed under existing state law to deduct the amount of
  6 14 depreciation that would otherwise be allowable under federal
  6 15 law, without regard to the bonus depreciation allowance.
  6 16    Under current law, taxpayers are in some instances required,

  6 19 to recompute their federal adjusted gross income to take
  6 20 into account the fact that Iowa has decoupled from bonus
  6 21 depreciation.  The bill provides that taxpayers must make those
  6 22 same adjustments to federal adjusted gross income for tax year
  6 23 2015 to account for the fact that Iowa has decoupled from bonus
  6 24 depreciation as described above.
  6 25    The division takes effect upon enactment and applies
  6 26 retroactively to January 1, 2015.
  6 27    DIVISION II ==== SALES AND USE TAXES.  The bill rescinds
  6 28 several administrative rules and amendments to administrative
  6 29 rules of the department of revenue relating to the
  6 30 manufacturing sales and use tax exemptions under Code sections
  6 31 423.3(47) and 423.3(48) for the purchase of certain items used
  6 32 in manufacturing, research and development, data processing

  7  5 amendments to administrative rules also concern the treatment
  7  6 of these tax=exempt items as they relate to the taxation of
  7  7 construction activities under Code sections 423.2(1)(b) and
  7  8 423.2(1)(c) by amending the method for determining whether
  7  9 the items are considered real property and taxed as building
  7 10 materials when purchased in furtherance of a construction
  7 11 contract, or considered tangible personal property eligible for
  7 12 the manufacturing sales and use tax exemptions.
  7 13    The effect of rescinding the amendments to these
  7 14 administrative rules is to restore the language of the
  7 15 affected rules to that as it existed prior to the date
  7 16 the adopted amendments to the rules were published in the
  7 17 Iowa administrative bulletin.  The bill directs the Iowa
  7 18 administrative code editor to restore the text of the affected

  7 33    Under current law, the exemption includes replacement
  7 34 parts. The bill amends the exemption to include materials
  7 35 used to construct or self=construct replacement parts. The
  8  1 bill defines "replacement part" for purposes of the exemption
  8  2 to mean tangible personal property other than computers,
  8  3 machinery, equipment, or supplies, regardless of the cost or
  8  4 useful life of the property, that replaces a component of a
  8  5 computer, machinery, or equipment, performs the same or similar
  8  6 function as that component, and restores or improves the
  8  7 computer, machinery, or equipment.
  8  8    The bill also amends the exemption to include supplies
  8  9 and materials used to construct or self=construct supplies.
  8 10 "Supplies" is defined in the bill as tangible personal property
  8 11 that is not a computer, machinery, equipment, or replacement
  8 12 part and that meets one of the following four conditions:
  8 13    1.  The tangible personal property is to be connected to
  8 14 a computer, machinery, or equipment and requires regular
  8 15 replacement because it is consumed or deteriorates during use.
  8 16 The bill lists saw blades, drill bits, filters, and other
  8 17 similar items with a short useful life as examples.
  8 18    2.  The tangible personal property is used in conjunction
  8 19 with a computer, machinery, or equipment and is specially
  8 20 designed for use in manufacturing specific products and may
  8 21 be used interchangeably and intermittently on a particular
  8 22 computer, machine, or piece of equipment.  The bill lists jigs,
  8 23 dies, tools, and other similar items as examples.
  8 24    3.  The tangible personal property comes into physical
  8 25 contact with other tangible personal property used in
  8 26 processing and is used to assist with or maintain conditions
  8 27 necessary for processing.  The bill lists cutting fluids, oils,
  8 28 coolants, lubricants, and other similar items with a short
  8 29 useful life as examples.
  8 30    4. The tangible property is directly and primarily used
  8 31 in an activity described in Code section 423.3(47)(a)(1)=(6).
  8 32 The bill lists prototype materials and testing materials as
  8 33 examples.

  5 29    Code section 422.9 provides individuals a deduction from
  5 30 net income for state sales and use taxes if the individual
  5 31 chose to deduct sales and use tax in lieu of state income taxes
  5 32 or the standard deduction for federal income tax purposes.
  5 33 This deduction was set to expire under both federal and Iowa
  5 34 law for tax years beginning on or after January 1, 2015.  The
  5 35 federal Protecting Americans from Tax Hikes Act of 2015 made
  6  1 the federal deduction permanent.  The bill allows the Iowa
  6  2 deduction for tax years beginning during the 2015 calendar
  6  3 year.
  6  4    The bill decouples, for Iowa income tax purposes for tax
  6  5 years ending on or after January 1, 2015, but before January
  6  6 1, 2016, from the federal additional first=year depreciation
  6  7 allowance in section 168(k) of the Internal Revenue Code
  6  8 (bonus depreciation) which was modified and extended through
  6  9 2019 by the federal Protecting Americans from Tax Hikes Act
  6 10 of 2015.  Taxpayers who claim bonus depreciation for federal
  6 11 tax purposes are, for the applicable tax year, required to add
  6 12 such depreciation amounts back to Iowa net income, but are
  6 13 then allowed under existing state law to deduct the amount of
  6 14 depreciation that would otherwise be allowable under federal
  6 15 law, without regard to the bonus depreciation allowance.
  6 16    Under current law, taxpayers are in some instances required,
  6 17 when calculating alternative minimum tax under Code section
  6 18 422.5(2) and itemized deductions under Code section 422.9(2),
  6 19 to recompute their federal adjusted gross income to take
  6 20 into account the fact that Iowa has decoupled from bonus
  6 21 depreciation.  The bill provides that taxpayers must make those
  6 22 same adjustments to federal adjusted gross income for tax year
  6 23 2015 to account for the fact that Iowa has decoupled from bonus
  6 24 depreciation as described above.

  6 35 and equipment, and to the definitions of several applicable
  7  1 terms, including but not limited to definitions for tax=exempt
  7  2 "computers", "machinery", "equipment", "replacement parts",
  7  3 and "materials used to construct or self=construct computers,
  7  4 machinery, and equipment".  These administrative rules and
  7  5 amendments to administrative rules also concern the treatment
  7  6 of these tax=exempt items as they relate to the taxation of
  7  7 construction activities under Code sections 423.2(1)(b) and
  7  8 423.2(1)(c) by amending the method for determining whether
  7  9 the items are considered real property and taxed as building
  7 10 materials when purchased in furtherance of a construction
  7 11 contract, or considered tangible personal property eligible for
  7 12 the manufacturing sales and use tax exemptions.
  7 13    The effect of rescinding the amendments to these
  7 14 administrative rules is to restore the language of the
  7 15 affected rules to that as it existed prior to the date

  8 27 necessary for processing.  The bill lists cutting fluids, oils,
  8 28 coolants, lubricants, and other similar items with a short

  6  1 the federal deduction permanent.  The bill allows the Iowa
  6  2 deduction for tax years beginning during the 2015 calendar
  6  3 year.

  6  5 years ending on or after January 1, 2015, but before January
  6  6 1, 2016, from the federal additional first=year depreciation
  6  7 allowance in section 168(k) of the Internal Revenue Code
  6  8 (bonus depreciation) which was modified and extended through
  6  9 2019 by the federal Protecting Americans from Tax Hikes Act
  6 10 of 2015.  Taxpayers who claim bonus depreciation for federal
  6 11 tax purposes are, for the applicable tax year, required to add
  6 12 such depreciation amounts back to Iowa net income, but are
  6 13 then allowed under existing state law to deduct the amount of
  6 14 depreciation that would otherwise be allowable under federal
  6 15 law, without regard to the bonus depreciation allowance.
  6 16    Under current law, taxpayers are in some instances required,
  6 17 when calculating alternative minimum tax under Code section
  6 18 422.5(2) and itemized deductions under Code section 422.9(2),

  6  4    The bill decouples, for Iowa income tax purposes for tax
  6  5 years ending on or after January 1, 2015, but before January
  6  6 1, 2016, from the federal additional first=year depreciation
  6  7 allowance in section 168(k) of the Internal Revenue Code
  6  8 (bonus depreciation) which was modified and extended through
  6  9 2019 by the federal Protecting Americans from Tax Hikes Act
  6 10 of 2015.  Taxpayers who claim bonus depreciation for federal
  6 11 tax purposes are, for the applicable tax year, required to add
  6 12 such depreciation amounts back to Iowa net income, but are
  6 13 then allowed under existing state law to deduct the amount of
  6 14 depreciation that would otherwise be allowable under federal

  6 17 when calculating alternative minimum tax under Code section
  6 18 422.5(2) and itemized deductions under Code section 422.9(2),
  6 19 to recompute their federal adjusted gross income to take

  6 23 2015 to account for the fact that Iowa has decoupled from bonus

  7  6 of these tax=exempt items as they relate to the taxation of
  7  7 construction activities under Code sections 423.2(1)(b) and
  7  8 423.2(1)(c) by amending the method for determining whether

  6  9 2019 by the federal Protecting Americans from Tax Hikes Act
  6 10 of 2015.  Taxpayers who claim bonus depreciation for federal
  6 11 tax purposes are, for the applicable tax year, required to add
  6 12 such depreciation amounts back to Iowa net income, but are
  6 13 then allowed under existing state law to deduct the amount of
  6 14 depreciation that would otherwise be allowable under federal
  6 15 law, without regard to the bonus depreciation allowance.
  6 16    Under current law, taxpayers are in some instances required,
  6 17 when calculating alternative minimum tax under Code section
  6 18 422.5(2) and itemized deductions under Code section 422.9(2),
  6 19 to recompute their federal adjusted gross income to take
  6 20 into account the fact that Iowa has decoupled from bonus
  6 21 depreciation.  The bill provides that taxpayers must make those
  6 22 same adjustments to federal adjusted gross income for tax year
  6 23 2015 to account for the fact that Iowa has decoupled from bonus
  6 24 depreciation as described above.

  7  6 of these tax=exempt items as they relate to the taxation of
  7  7 construction activities under Code sections 423.2(1)(b) and

  7 11 contract, or considered tangible personal property eligible for
  7 12 the manufacturing sales and use tax exemptions.
