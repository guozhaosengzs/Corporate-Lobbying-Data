  4  3    b.  "Executive branch employee" means an employee of the

  4  7 or independent agency as defined in section 7E.4, and each
  4  8 principal central department enumerated in section 7E.5;

  4 13 and rationale for the bonus paid, shall be a public record.
  4 14    3.  All decisions to provide bonus pay to an executive branch
  4 15 employee, including information described in subsection 2,

  4 28                           EXPLANATION
  4 29 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  4 30 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  4 31    This bill concerns government accountability and government
  4 32 employment practices.
  4 33    PERSONNEL RECORDS AND SETTLEMENT AGREEMENTS.  This division
  4 34 of the bill relates to personal information in confidential
  4 35 personnel records of government bodies and personnel settlement
  5  1 agreements.
  5  2    Code section 22.7(11), governing personal information
  5  3 in confidential personnel records of government bodies,
  5  4 is amended.  Previous legislation, effective May 12, 2011,
  5  5 provides that certain information in confidential personnel
  5  6 records is considered a public record.  The bill provides
  5  7 that this information in a confidential personnel record as
  5  8 of or after January 1, 2004, is a public record.  The bill
  5  9 further amends this subsection to provide that information
  5 10 in an official's, officer's, or employee's personnel records
  5 11 concerning the fact that such an individual resigned in
  5 12 lieu of termination or was demoted as the result of a final
  5 13 disciplinary action by a government body and the documented
  5 14 reasons and rationale for any resignation in lieu of
  5 15 termination, discharge, or demotion against an individual
  5 16 are public records and not confidential.  Under current law,
  5 17 only the fact in a personnel record that the individual was
  5 18 discharged is considered a public record and not confidential.
  5 19 The amendments to this subsection take effect upon enactment
  5 20 and apply retroactively to information contained as of or after
  5 21 January 1, 2004, in personnel records.
  5 22    New Code section 70A.35 provides that personnel settlement
  5 23 agreements between the state and an employee of the state shall
  5 24 not contain any confidentiality or nondisclosure provisions
  5 25 that attempt to prevent the disclosure of the personnel
  5 26 settlement agreement and shall be made available to the public
  5 27 on an internet site.  In addition, the bill provides that any
  5 28 confidentiality or nondisclosure provision in a personnel
  5 29 settlement agreement is not enforceable. New Code section
  5 30 70A.35 is applicable to employees of a state employer and
  5 31 defines a personnel settlement agreement as a binding legal
  5 32 agreement between an employee and the employee's state employer
  5 33 to resolve a personnel dispute including but not limited to
  5 34 certain grievances.  The bill defines "state employer" to
  5 35 include the executive, legislative, and judicial branches
  6  1 of government. The bill provides that the internet site be
  6  2 maintained by the department of administrative services,
  6  3 board of regents, general assembly, or judicial branch, as
  6  4 applicable, based on the employee covered.  The bill also
  6  5 provides that the requirements of this new provision shall not
  6  6 be superseded by any collective bargaining agreement.  These
  6  7 provisions of this division of this bill take effect upon
  6  8 enactment.
  6  9    The division further provides that this division of the bill
  6 10 shall not be construed to limit the ability of law enforcement
  6 11 personnel to investigate any activity that may violate state
  6 12 law.
  6 13    STATE EMPLOYEE BONUSES.  This division of the bill concerns
  6 14 executive branch bonuses.  New Code section 22.13A requires
  6 15 that information concerning bonus pay awarded to an executive
  6 16 branch employee in any amount, including the name of the
  6 17 employee, the amount paid and the reasons for the bonus, shall
  6 18 be made easily accessible to the public on an internet site.
  6 19 This division of the bill takes effect upon enactment.

  4 30 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  4 31    This bill concerns government accountability and government
  4 32 employment practices.
  4 33    PERSONNEL RECORDS AND SETTLEMENT AGREEMENTS.  This division
  4 34 of the bill relates to personal information in confidential
  4 35 personnel records of government bodies and personnel settlement
  5  1 agreements.
  5  2    Code section 22.7(11), governing personal information
  5  3 in confidential personnel records of government bodies,
  5  4 is amended.  Previous legislation, effective May 12, 2011,
  5  5 provides that certain information in confidential personnel
  5  6 records is considered a public record.  The bill provides
  5  7 that this information in a confidential personnel record as
  5  8 of or after January 1, 2004, is a public record.  The bill
  5  9 further amends this subsection to provide that information
  5 10 in an official's, officer's, or employee's personnel records
  5 11 concerning the fact that such an individual resigned in
  5 12 lieu of termination or was demoted as the result of a final
  5 13 disciplinary action by a government body and the documented
  5 14 reasons and rationale for any resignation in lieu of
  5 15 termination, discharge, or demotion against an individual
  5 16 are public records and not confidential.  Under current law,
  5 17 only the fact in a personnel record that the individual was
  5 18 discharged is considered a public record and not confidential.
  5 19 The amendments to this subsection take effect upon enactment
  5 20 and apply retroactively to information contained as of or after
  5 21 January 1, 2004, in personnel records.
  5 22    New Code section 70A.35 provides that personnel settlement
  5 23 agreements between the state and an employee of the state shall
  5 24 not contain any confidentiality or nondisclosure provisions
  5 25 that attempt to prevent the disclosure of the personnel
  5 26 settlement agreement and shall be made available to the public
  5 27 on an internet site.  In addition, the bill provides that any
  5 28 confidentiality or nondisclosure provision in a personnel
  5 29 settlement agreement is not enforceable. New Code section
  5 30 70A.35 is applicable to employees of a state employer and
  5 31 defines a personnel settlement agreement as a binding legal
  5 32 agreement between an employee and the employee's state employer
  5 33 to resolve a personnel dispute including but not limited to
  5 34 certain grievances.  The bill defines "state employer" to
  5 35 include the executive, legislative, and judicial branches
  6  1 of government. The bill provides that the internet site be
  6  2 maintained by the department of administrative services,
  6  3 board of regents, general assembly, or judicial branch, as
  6  4 applicable, based on the employee covered.  The bill also
  6  5 provides that the requirements of this new provision shall not
  6  6 be superseded by any collective bargaining agreement.  These
  6  7 provisions of this division of this bill take effect upon
  6  8 enactment.
  6  9    The division further provides that this division of the bill
  6 10 shall not be construed to limit the ability of law enforcement
  6 11 personnel to investigate any activity that may violate state
  6 12 law.
  6 13    STATE EMPLOYEE BONUSES.  This division of the bill concerns
  6 14 executive branch bonuses.  New Code section 22.13A requires
  6 15 that information concerning bonus pay awarded to an executive
  6 16 branch employee in any amount, including the name of the
  6 17 employee, the amount paid and the reasons for the bonus, shall
  6 18 be made easily accessible to the public on an internet site.

  4 29 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  4 30 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  4 31    This bill concerns government accountability and government
  4 32 employment practices.
  4 33    PERSONNEL RECORDS AND SETTLEMENT AGREEMENTS.  This division
  4 34 of the bill relates to personal information in confidential
  4 35 personnel records of government bodies and personnel settlement
  5  1 agreements.
  5  2    Code section 22.7(11), governing personal information
  5  3 in confidential personnel records of government bodies,
  5  4 is amended.  Previous legislation, effective May 12, 2011,
  5  5 provides that certain information in confidential personnel
  5  6 records is considered a public record.  The bill provides
  5  7 that this information in a confidential personnel record as
  5  8 of or after January 1, 2004, is a public record.  The bill
  5  9 further amends this subsection to provide that information
  5 10 in an official's, officer's, or employee's personnel records
  5 11 concerning the fact that such an individual resigned in
  5 12 lieu of termination or was demoted as the result of a final
  5 13 disciplinary action by a government body and the documented
  5 14 reasons and rationale for any resignation in lieu of
  5 15 termination, discharge, or demotion against an individual
  5 16 are public records and not confidential.  Under current law,
  5 17 only the fact in a personnel record that the individual was
  5 18 discharged is considered a public record and not confidential.
  5 19 The amendments to this subsection take effect upon enactment
  5 20 and apply retroactively to information contained as of or after
  5 21 January 1, 2004, in personnel records.
  5 22    New Code section 70A.35 provides that personnel settlement
  5 23 agreements between the state and an employee of the state shall
  5 24 not contain any confidentiality or nondisclosure provisions
  5 25 that attempt to prevent the disclosure of the personnel
  5 26 settlement agreement and shall be made available to the public
  5 27 on an internet site.  In addition, the bill provides that any
  5 28 confidentiality or nondisclosure provision in a personnel
  5 29 settlement agreement is not enforceable. New Code section
  5 30 70A.35 is applicable to employees of a state employer and
  5 31 defines a personnel settlement agreement as a binding legal
  5 32 agreement between an employee and the employee's state employer
  5 33 to resolve a personnel dispute including but not limited to
  5 34 certain grievances.  The bill defines "state employer" to
  5 35 include the executive, legislative, and judicial branches
  6  1 of government. The bill provides that the internet site be
  6  2 maintained by the department of administrative services,
  6  3 board of regents, general assembly, or judicial branch, as
  6  4 applicable, based on the employee covered.  The bill also
  6  5 provides that the requirements of this new provision shall not
  6  6 be superseded by any collective bargaining agreement.  These
  6  7 provisions of this division of this bill take effect upon
  6  8 enactment.
  6  9    The division further provides that this division of the bill
  6 10 shall not be construed to limit the ability of law enforcement
  6 11 personnel to investigate any activity that may violate state
  6 12 law.

  4 29 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  4 30 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  4 31    This bill concerns government accountability and government
  4 32 employment practices.
  4 33    PERSONNEL RECORDS AND SETTLEMENT AGREEMENTS.  This division
  4 34 of the bill relates to personal information in confidential
  4 35 personnel records of government bodies and personnel settlement
  5  1 agreements.
  5  2    Code section 22.7(11), governing personal information
  5  3 in confidential personnel records of government bodies,
  5  4 is amended.  Previous legislation, effective May 12, 2011,
  5  5 provides that certain information in confidential personnel
  5  6 records is considered a public record.  The bill provides
  5  7 that this information in a confidential personnel record as
  5  8 of or after January 1, 2004, is a public record.  The bill
  5  9 further amends this subsection to provide that information
  5 10 in an official's, officer's, or employee's personnel records
  5 11 concerning the fact that such an individual resigned in
  5 12 lieu of termination or was demoted as the result of a final
  5 13 disciplinary action by a government body and the documented
  5 14 reasons and rationale for any resignation in lieu of
  5 15 termination, discharge, or demotion against an individual
  5 16 are public records and not confidential.  Under current law,
  5 17 only the fact in a personnel record that the individual was
  5 18 discharged is considered a public record and not confidential.
  5 19 The amendments to this subsection take effect upon enactment
  5 20 and apply retroactively to information contained as of or after
  5 21 January 1, 2004, in personnel records.
  5 22    New Code section 70A.35 provides that personnel settlement
  5 23 agreements between the state and an employee of the state shall
  5 24 not contain any confidentiality or nondisclosure provisions
  5 25 that attempt to prevent the disclosure of the personnel
  5 26 settlement agreement and shall be made available to the public
  5 27 on an internet site.  In addition, the bill provides that any
  5 28 confidentiality or nondisclosure provision in a personnel
  5 29 settlement agreement is not enforceable. New Code section
  5 30 70A.35 is applicable to employees of a state employer and
  5 31 defines a personnel settlement agreement as a binding legal
  5 32 agreement between an employee and the employee's state employer
  5 33 to resolve a personnel dispute including but not limited to
  5 34 certain grievances.  The bill defines "state employer" to
  5 35 include the executive, legislative, and judicial branches
  6  1 of government. The bill provides that the internet site be
  6  2 maintained by the department of administrative services,
  6  3 board of regents, general assembly, or judicial branch, as
  6  4 applicable, based on the employee covered.  The bill also
  6  5 provides that the requirements of this new provision shall not
  6  6 be superseded by any collective bargaining agreement.  These
  6  7 provisions of this division of this bill take effect upon
  6  8 enactment.
  6  9    The division further provides that this division of the bill
  6 10 shall not be construed to limit the ability of law enforcement
  6 11 personnel to investigate any activity that may violate state
  6 12 law.
  6 13    STATE EMPLOYEE BONUSES.  This division of the bill concerns

  6 16 branch employee in any amount, including the name of the
  6 17 employee, the amount paid and the reasons for the bonus, shall

  5 11 concerning the fact that such an individual resigned in
  5 12 lieu of termination or was demoted as the result of a final

  5 16 are public records and not confidential.  Under current law,

  5 19 The amendments to this subsection take effect upon enactment
  5 20 and apply retroactively to information contained as of or after

  5 22    New Code section 70A.35 provides that personnel settlement
  5 23 agreements between the state and an employee of the state shall
  5 24 not contain any confidentiality or nondisclosure provisions
  5 25 that attempt to prevent the disclosure of the personnel
  5 26 settlement agreement and shall be made available to the public
  5 27 on an internet site.  In addition, the bill provides that any
  5 28 confidentiality or nondisclosure provision in a personnel
  5 29 settlement agreement is not enforceable. New Code section
  5 30 70A.35 is applicable to employees of a state employer and
  5 31 defines a personnel settlement agreement as a binding legal
  5 32 agreement between an employee and the employee's state employer
  5 33 to resolve a personnel dispute including but not limited to
