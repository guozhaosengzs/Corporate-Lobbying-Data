 23  9                          APPLICABILITY
 23 10    Sec. 24.  APPLICABILITY.  The provisions of this Act apply
 23 11 to manufacturer and dealer agreements that are entered into or
 23 12 renewed on or after July 1, 2016.
 23 13                           EXPLANATION
 23 14 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
 23 15 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
 23 16    This bill regulates agreements between manufacturers or
 23 17 distributors, and dealers relating to the sale of recreational
 23 18 vehicles and includes coordinating amendments and applicability
 23 19 provisions.
 23 20    DIVISION I.  New Code chapter 322E regulates manufacturer
 23 21 and dealer agreements fixing the rights and responsibilities of
 23 22 each party pertaining to the sale of new recreational vehicles
 23 23 in the state.  A "recreational vehicle" is a vehicle that is
 23 24 either self=propelled or towed by a consumer=owned tow vehicle
 23 25 and is primarily designed to provide temporary living quarters
 23 26 for recreational, camping, or travel use.  A "recreational
 23 27 vehicle" includes a "motor home", and a "travel trailer" such
 23 28 as a fifth=wheel trailer, folding camping trailer, or a park
 23 29 model recreational vehicle.
 23 30    A manufacturer or distributor, and a dealer are required
 23 31 to enter into a written manufacturer and dealer agreement
 23 32 before selling new recreational vehicles in the state.  The
 23 33 agreement must designate the dealer's exclusive area of sales
 23 34 responsibility.  A manufacturer or distributor, or a dealer
 23 35 may terminate, cancel, or fail to renew the agreement with
 24  1 good cause and the bill specifies notification requirements,
 24  2 what factors may be considered in determining whether good
 24  3 cause exists, and requirements concerning repurchase or sale of
 24  4 remaining inventory of recreational vehicles and outstanding
 24  5 financial obligations between the parties to the agreement.
 24  6 The party that terminates, cancels, or fails to renew the
 24  7 agreement for good cause has the burden of showing cause.
 24  8    The bill requires that a dealer that desires to make a change
 24  9 in ownership of the dealership give notice to the manufacturer
 24 10 or distributor of the proposed change.  The manufacturer or
 24 11 distributor is not allowed to object to the proposal unless the
 24 12 objection is due to factors specified in the bill concerning
 24 13 the proposed transferee.  The manufacturer must make a written
 24 14 objection and has the burden of proving that the objection
 24 15 complies with the bill's requirements.
 24 16    A manufacturer or distributor is prohibited from failing to
 24 17 provide a dealer with the opportunity to designate a family
 24 18 member as a successor to the dealership in the event of the
 24 19 dealer's death, incapacity, or retirement so long as the
 24 20 dealer gives written notice of the designation before it takes
 24 21 effect.  The manufacturer or distributor cannot object to the
 24 22 designation unless the dealer is in breach of the manufacturer
 24 23 and dealer agreement or in violation of the provisions of new
 24 24 Code chapter 322E or the objection is due to other specified
 24 25 factors.  A manufacturer or distributor is prohibited from
 24 26 refusing to honor the succession of the designated family
 24 27 member unless the manufacturer or distributor has provided the
 24 28 dealer with written notice of an objection to the dealer's
 24 29 designation after receiving notice of the designation.
 24 30    In regards to warranty obligations on new recreational
 24 31 vehicles, the bill requires the warrantor, that person
 24 32 providing a written warranty on the vehicles, to specify the
 24 33 dealer's obligations for preparation, delivery, and warranty
 24 34 services on the warrantor's products and how the dealer will
 24 35 be compensated for provision of those services.  The bill
 25  1 specifies the warrantor's and dealer's obligations to each
 25  2 other concerning warranties.
 25  3    The bill provides that both the warrantor and the dealer have
 25  4 duties to indemnify and hold each other harmless to the extent
 25  5 that losses or damages are caused by the negligence or willful
 25  6 misconduct of the other.  These duties continue even after a
 25  7 new recreational vehicle is titled.
 25  8    The bill specifies the rights and obligations of a dealer and
 25  9 a manufacturer or distributor when a new recreational vehicle
 25 10 is damaged in transit.  The bill specifies a time frame for a
 25 11 dealer to inspect a delivered vehicle and to either reject or
 25 12 request to repair the damaged vehicle.
 25 13    The bill provides that a manufacturer or distributor shall
 25 14 not coerce or attempt to coerce a dealer to purchase a product
 25 15 the dealer did not order, to enter into an agreement with the
 25 16 manufacturer or distributor, or to enter into an agreement
 25 17 with the manufacturer or distributor that requires the dealer
 25 18 to submit disputes to binding arbitration or otherwise waive
 25 19 rights or responsibilities provided for under the bill.  The

 23 14 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
 23 15 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
 23 16    This bill regulates agreements between manufacturers or
 23 17 distributors, and dealers relating to the sale of recreational
 23 18 vehicles and includes coordinating amendments and applicability
 23 19 provisions.
 23 20    DIVISION I.  New Code chapter 322E regulates manufacturer
 23 21 and dealer agreements fixing the rights and responsibilities of
 23 22 each party pertaining to the sale of new recreational vehicles
 23 23 in the state.  A "recreational vehicle" is a vehicle that is
 23 24 either self=propelled or towed by a consumer=owned tow vehicle
 23 25 and is primarily designed to provide temporary living quarters
 23 26 for recreational, camping, or travel use.  A "recreational
 23 27 vehicle" includes a "motor home", and a "travel trailer" such
 23 28 as a fifth=wheel trailer, folding camping trailer, or a park
 23 29 model recreational vehicle.
 23 30    A manufacturer or distributor, and a dealer are required
 23 31 to enter into a written manufacturer and dealer agreement
 23 32 before selling new recreational vehicles in the state.  The
 23 33 agreement must designate the dealer's exclusive area of sales
 23 34 responsibility.  A manufacturer or distributor, or a dealer
 23 35 may terminate, cancel, or fail to renew the agreement with
 24  1 good cause and the bill specifies notification requirements,
 24  2 what factors may be considered in determining whether good
 24  3 cause exists, and requirements concerning repurchase or sale of
 24  4 remaining inventory of recreational vehicles and outstanding
 24  5 financial obligations between the parties to the agreement.
 24  6 The party that terminates, cancels, or fails to renew the
 24  7 agreement for good cause has the burden of showing cause.
 24  8    The bill requires that a dealer that desires to make a change
 24  9 in ownership of the dealership give notice to the manufacturer
 24 10 or distributor of the proposed change.  The manufacturer or
 24 11 distributor is not allowed to object to the proposal unless the
 24 12 objection is due to factors specified in the bill concerning
 24 13 the proposed transferee.  The manufacturer must make a written
 24 14 objection and has the burden of proving that the objection
 24 15 complies with the bill's requirements.
 24 16    A manufacturer or distributor is prohibited from failing to
 24 17 provide a dealer with the opportunity to designate a family
 24 18 member as a successor to the dealership in the event of the
 24 19 dealer's death, incapacity, or retirement so long as the
 24 20 dealer gives written notice of the designation before it takes
 24 21 effect.  The manufacturer or distributor cannot object to the
 24 22 designation unless the dealer is in breach of the manufacturer
 24 23 and dealer agreement or in violation of the provisions of new
 24 24 Code chapter 322E or the objection is due to other specified
 24 25 factors.  A manufacturer or distributor is prohibited from
 24 26 refusing to honor the succession of the designated family
 24 27 member unless the manufacturer or distributor has provided the
 24 28 dealer with written notice of an objection to the dealer's
 24 29 designation after receiving notice of the designation.
 24 30    In regards to warranty obligations on new recreational
 24 31 vehicles, the bill requires the warrantor, that person
 24 32 providing a written warranty on the vehicles, to specify the
 24 33 dealer's obligations for preparation, delivery, and warranty
 24 34 services on the warrantor's products and how the dealer will
 24 35 be compensated for provision of those services.  The bill
 25  1 specifies the warrantor's and dealer's obligations to each
 25  2 other concerning warranties.
 25  3    The bill provides that both the warrantor and the dealer have
 25  4 duties to indemnify and hold each other harmless to the extent
 25  5 that losses or damages are caused by the negligence or willful
 25  6 misconduct of the other.  These duties continue even after a
 25  7 new recreational vehicle is titled.
 25  8    The bill specifies the rights and obligations of a dealer and
 25  9 a manufacturer or distributor when a new recreational vehicle
 25 10 is damaged in transit.  The bill specifies a time frame for a
 25 11 dealer to inspect a delivered vehicle and to either reject or
 25 12 request to repair the damaged vehicle.
 25 13    The bill provides that a manufacturer or distributor shall
 25 14 not coerce or attempt to coerce a dealer to purchase a product
 25 15 the dealer did not order, to enter into an agreement with the
 25 16 manufacturer or distributor, or to enter into an agreement
 25 17 with the manufacturer or distributor that requires the dealer
 25 18 to submit disputes to binding arbitration or otherwise waive
 25 19 rights or responsibilities provided for under the bill.  The
 25 20 bill specifies some of the activities that could be considered
 25 21 coercion for purposes of the bill.
 25 22    A dealer, manufacturer, distributor, or warrantor injured
 25 23 by another party's violation of the provisions of new Code

 24 13 the proposed transferee.  The manufacturer must make a written
 24 14 objection and has the burden of proving that the objection
 24 15 complies with the bill's requirements.
 24 16    A manufacturer or distributor is prohibited from failing to
 24 17 provide a dealer with the opportunity to designate a family
 24 18 member as a successor to the dealership in the event of the
 24 19 dealer's death, incapacity, or retirement so long as the
 24 20 dealer gives written notice of the designation before it takes
 24 21 effect.  The manufacturer or distributor cannot object to the
 24 22 designation unless the dealer is in breach of the manufacturer
 24 23 and dealer agreement or in violation of the provisions of new
 24 24 Code chapter 322E or the objection is due to other specified
 24 25 factors.  A manufacturer or distributor is prohibited from
 24 26 refusing to honor the succession of the designated family
 24 27 member unless the manufacturer or distributor has provided the
 24 28 dealer with written notice of an objection to the dealer's
 24 29 designation after receiving notice of the designation.
 24 30    In regards to warranty obligations on new recreational
 24 31 vehicles, the bill requires the warrantor, that person
 24 32 providing a written warranty on the vehicles, to specify the
 24 33 dealer's obligations for preparation, delivery, and warranty
 24 34 services on the warrantor's products and how the dealer will
 24 35 be compensated for provision of those services.  The bill
 25  1 specifies the warrantor's and dealer's obligations to each
 25  2 other concerning warranties.
 25  3    The bill provides that both the warrantor and the dealer have
 25  4 duties to indemnify and hold each other harmless to the extent
 25  5 that losses or damages are caused by the negligence or willful
 25  6 misconduct of the other.  These duties continue even after a
 25  7 new recreational vehicle is titled.
 25  8    The bill specifies the rights and obligations of a dealer and
 25  9 a manufacturer or distributor when a new recreational vehicle
 25 10 is damaged in transit.  The bill specifies a time frame for a
 25 11 dealer to inspect a delivered vehicle and to either reject or
 25 12 request to repair the damaged vehicle.
 25 13    The bill provides that a manufacturer or distributor shall
 25 14 not coerce or attempt to coerce a dealer to purchase a product
 25 15 the dealer did not order, to enter into an agreement with the
 25 16 manufacturer or distributor, or to enter into an agreement
 25 17 with the manufacturer or distributor that requires the dealer
 25 18 to submit disputes to binding arbitration or otherwise waive
 25 19 rights or responsibilities provided for under the bill.  The
 25 20 bill specifies some of the activities that could be considered
 25 21 coercion for purposes of the bill.
 25 22    A dealer, manufacturer, distributor, or warrantor injured
 25 23 by another party's violation of the provisions of new Code
 25 24 chapter 322E may bring a civil action in district court to
 25 25 recover actual damages.  However, prior to bringing suit, the
 25 26 party alleging the violation may serve a request for mediation
 25 27 upon the alleged offending party.  If both parties agree to
 25 28 mediation, the parties mutually select and share the cost of
 25 29 retaining an independent mediator to attempt to resolve the
 25 30 dispute or alleged violation.  Service of the mediation request
 25 31 tolls the time for filing any other proceeding or action and
 25 32 the district court is required to suspend any proceeding or
 25 33 action until the mediation meeting occurs.  In addition to any
 25 34 other remedy, either party may apply to the district court for
 25 35 a temporary or permanent injunction.
 26  1 The bill provides that a manufacturer and dealer agreement
 26  2 cannot restrict jurisdiction over the agreement to a forum

 26  4 to jurisdiction outside of this state, and cannot limit actions
 26  5 or proceedings to a designated jurisdiction.

 26 10 state.
 26 11    A manufacturer and dealer agreement also cannot require a
 26 12 dealer to waive compliance with, or relieve a person of a duty
 26 13 or liability imposed, or a right provided, under the bill.
 26 14 This provision does not prohibit the settlement of disputes
 26 15 where separate and adequate consideration is given for a waiver

 26 18 franchisers, a recreational vehicle as defined in the bill

 23 15 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
 23 16    This bill regulates agreements between manufacturers or
 23 17 distributors, and dealers relating to the sale of recreational
 23 18 vehicles and includes coordinating amendments and applicability
 23 19 provisions.
 23 20    DIVISION I.  New Code chapter 322E regulates manufacturer
 23 21 and dealer agreements fixing the rights and responsibilities of
 23 22 each party pertaining to the sale of new recreational vehicles
 23 23 in the state.  A "recreational vehicle" is a vehicle that is
 23 24 either self=propelled or towed by a consumer=owned tow vehicle
 23 25 and is primarily designed to provide temporary living quarters
 23 26 for recreational, camping, or travel use.  A "recreational
 23 27 vehicle" includes a "motor home", and a "travel trailer" such

 23 29 model recreational vehicle.
 23 30    A manufacturer or distributor, and a dealer are required
 23 31 to enter into a written manufacturer and dealer agreement
 23 32 before selling new recreational vehicles in the state.  The
 23 33 agreement must designate the dealer's exclusive area of sales
 23 34 responsibility.  A manufacturer or distributor, or a dealer
 23 35 may terminate, cancel, or fail to renew the agreement with

 24  8    The bill requires that a dealer that desires to make a change
 24  9 in ownership of the dealership give notice to the manufacturer
 24 10 or distributor of the proposed change.  The manufacturer or
 24 11 distributor is not allowed to object to the proposal unless the
 24 12 objection is due to factors specified in the bill concerning
 24 13 the proposed transferee.  The manufacturer must make a written
 24 14 objection and has the burden of proving that the objection
 24 15 complies with the bill's requirements.
 24 16    A manufacturer or distributor is prohibited from failing to
 24 17 provide a dealer with the opportunity to designate a family
 24 18 member as a successor to the dealership in the event of the
 24 19 dealer's death, incapacity, or retirement so long as the

 23 18 vehicles and includes coordinating amendments and applicability
 23 19 provisions.
 23 20    DIVISION I.  New Code chapter 322E regulates manufacturer
 23 21 and dealer agreements fixing the rights and responsibilities of
 23 22 each party pertaining to the sale of new recreational vehicles
 23 23 in the state.  A "recreational vehicle" is a vehicle that is
 23 24 either self=propelled or towed by a consumer=owned tow vehicle
 23 25 and is primarily designed to provide temporary living quarters
 23 26 for recreational, camping, or travel use.  A "recreational
 23 27 vehicle" includes a "motor home", and a "travel trailer" such
 23 28 as a fifth=wheel trailer, folding camping trailer, or a park
 23 29 model recreational vehicle.
 23 30    A manufacturer or distributor, and a dealer are required
 23 31 to enter into a written manufacturer and dealer agreement
 23 32 before selling new recreational vehicles in the state.  The
 23 33 agreement must designate the dealer's exclusive area of sales
 23 34 responsibility.  A manufacturer or distributor, or a dealer
 23 35 may terminate, cancel, or fail to renew the agreement with
 24  1 good cause and the bill specifies notification requirements,
 24  2 what factors may be considered in determining whether good
 24  3 cause exists, and requirements concerning repurchase or sale of
 24  4 remaining inventory of recreational vehicles and outstanding
 24  5 financial obligations between the parties to the agreement.
 24  6 The party that terminates, cancels, or fails to renew the
 24  7 agreement for good cause has the burden of showing cause.
 24  8    The bill requires that a dealer that desires to make a change
 24  9 in ownership of the dealership give notice to the manufacturer
 24 10 or distributor of the proposed change.  The manufacturer or
 24 11 distributor is not allowed to object to the proposal unless the
 24 12 objection is due to factors specified in the bill concerning
 24 13 the proposed transferee.  The manufacturer must make a written
 24 14 objection and has the burden of proving that the objection
 24 15 complies with the bill's requirements.
 24 16    A manufacturer or distributor is prohibited from failing to
 24 17 provide a dealer with the opportunity to designate a family
 24 18 member as a successor to the dealership in the event of the
 24 19 dealer's death, incapacity, or retirement so long as the
 24 20 dealer gives written notice of the designation before it takes
 24 21 effect.  The manufacturer or distributor cannot object to the
 24 22 designation unless the dealer is in breach of the manufacturer
 24 23 and dealer agreement or in violation of the provisions of new
 24 24 Code chapter 322E or the objection is due to other specified
 24 25 factors.  A manufacturer or distributor is prohibited from
 24 26 refusing to honor the succession of the designated family
 24 27 member unless the manufacturer or distributor has provided the
 24 28 dealer with written notice of an objection to the dealer's
 24 29 designation after receiving notice of the designation.
 24 30    In regards to warranty obligations on new recreational
 24 31 vehicles, the bill requires the warrantor, that person
 24 32 providing a written warranty on the vehicles, to specify the
 24 33 dealer's obligations for preparation, delivery, and warranty
 24 34 services on the warrantor's products and how the dealer will
 24 35 be compensated for provision of those services.  The bill
 25  1 specifies the warrantor's and dealer's obligations to each
 25  2 other concerning warranties.
 25  3    The bill provides that both the warrantor and the dealer have
 25  4 duties to indemnify and hold each other harmless to the extent
 25  5 that losses or damages are caused by the negligence or willful
 25  6 misconduct of the other.  These duties continue even after a
 25  7 new recreational vehicle is titled.
 25  8    The bill specifies the rights and obligations of a dealer and
 25  9 a manufacturer or distributor when a new recreational vehicle
 25 10 is damaged in transit.  The bill specifies a time frame for a
 25 11 dealer to inspect a delivered vehicle and to either reject or
 25 12 request to repair the damaged vehicle.
 25 13    The bill provides that a manufacturer or distributor shall
 25 14 not coerce or attempt to coerce a dealer to purchase a product
 25 15 the dealer did not order, to enter into an agreement with the
 25 16 manufacturer or distributor, or to enter into an agreement
 25 17 with the manufacturer or distributor that requires the dealer
 25 18 to submit disputes to binding arbitration or otherwise waive
 25 19 rights or responsibilities provided for under the bill.  The
 25 20 bill specifies some of the activities that could be considered
 25 21 coercion for purposes of the bill.
 25 22    A dealer, manufacturer, distributor, or warrantor injured
 25 23 by another party's violation of the provisions of new Code
 25 24 chapter 322E may bring a civil action in district court to
 25 25 recover actual damages.  However, prior to bringing suit, the
 25 26 party alleging the violation may serve a request for mediation
 25 27 upon the alleged offending party.  If both parties agree to
 25 28 mediation, the parties mutually select and share the cost of
 25 29 retaining an independent mediator to attempt to resolve the
 25 30 dispute or alleged violation.  Service of the mediation request
 25 31 tolls the time for filing any other proceeding or action and
 25 32 the district court is required to suspend any proceeding or
 25 33 action until the mediation meeting occurs.  In addition to any
 25 34 other remedy, either party may apply to the district court for
 25 35 a temporary or permanent injunction.
 26  1 The bill provides that a manufacturer and dealer agreement
 26  2 cannot restrict jurisdiction over the agreement to a forum
 26  3 outside of this state, cannot provide that the dealer consents
 26  4 to jurisdiction outside of this state, and cannot limit actions
 26  5 or proceedings to a designated jurisdiction.
 26  6    The bill provides that a manufacturer and dealer agreement
 26  7 cannot require the application of laws of another state in lieu
 26  8 of this state's laws or provide that the agreement is to be
 26  9 governed by or construed in accordance with the laws of another
 26 10 state.
 26 11    A manufacturer and dealer agreement also cannot require a
 26 12 dealer to waive compliance with, or relieve a person of a duty
 26 13 or liability imposed, or a right provided, under the bill.
 26 14 This provision does not prohibit the settlement of disputes
 26 15 where separate and adequate consideration is given for a waiver
 26 16 or release.
 26 17    Notwithstanding Code chapter 322A, relating to motor vehicle
 26 18 franchisers, a recreational vehicle as defined in the bill
 26 19 is not governed by Code chapter 322A for the sale of a new
 26 20 recreational vehicle through a dealer in this state by a
 26 21 manufacturer or distributor, or pursuant to a manufacturer and
 26 22 dealer agreement regulated by the bill's provisions.
 26 23    The bill provides that new Code chapter 322E shall be
 26 24 administered by the director of transportation.
 26 25    DIVISION II.  Division II of the bill includes coordinating
 26 26 amendments.

 26 32 from selling a motor vehicle that also meets the definition

 26 35 manufacturer and dealer agreement that meets the requirements
 27  1 of new Code chapter 322E.
 27  2    Code chapter 322C (travel trailer dealers, manufacturers,
 27  3 and distributors) is amended to include definitions of
 27  4 recreational vehicles that are consistent with the definitions
 27  5 in new Code chapter 322E.  Code section 322C.3(1) is amended
 27  6 to provide that the required manufacturer or distributor and
 27  7 dealer agreement must be made in accordance with the provisions
 27  8 of new Code chapter 322E.  Code section 322C.3 is amended to
 27  9 strike two provisions concerning manufacturers or distributors,
 27 10 and dealers of travel trailers that are inconsistent with
 27 11 provisions contained in new Code chapter 322E.
 27 12    Code section 537A.10(1)(c)(3) is amended to provide that for
 27 13 purposes of construction of contracts, a franchise does not
 27 14 include a contract entered into by a person regulated by new
 27 15 Code chapter 322E.
 27 16    DIVISION III.  The provisions of the bill apply to
 27 17 manufacturer and dealer agreements pertaining to the sale of

 23 15 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
 23 16    This bill regulates agreements between manufacturers or
 23 17 distributors, and dealers relating to the sale of recreational
 23 18 vehicles and includes coordinating amendments and applicability
 23 19 provisions.
 23 20    DIVISION I.  New Code chapter 322E regulates manufacturer
 23 21 and dealer agreements fixing the rights and responsibilities of
 23 22 each party pertaining to the sale of new recreational vehicles
 23 23 in the state.  A "recreational vehicle" is a vehicle that is
 23 24 either self=propelled or towed by a consumer=owned tow vehicle
 23 25 and is primarily designed to provide temporary living quarters
 23 26 for recreational, camping, or travel use.  A "recreational
 23 27 vehicle" includes a "motor home", and a "travel trailer" such
 23 28 as a fifth=wheel trailer, folding camping trailer, or a park
 23 29 model recreational vehicle.
 23 30    A manufacturer or distributor, and a dealer are required
 23 31 to enter into a written manufacturer and dealer agreement
 23 32 before selling new recreational vehicles in the state.  The
 23 33 agreement must designate the dealer's exclusive area of sales
 23 34 responsibility.  A manufacturer or distributor, or a dealer
 23 35 may terminate, cancel, or fail to renew the agreement with
 24  1 good cause and the bill specifies notification requirements,
 24  2 what factors may be considered in determining whether good
 24  3 cause exists, and requirements concerning repurchase or sale of
 24  4 remaining inventory of recreational vehicles and outstanding
 24  5 financial obligations between the parties to the agreement.
 24  6 The party that terminates, cancels, or fails to renew the
 24  7 agreement for good cause has the burden of showing cause.
 24  8    The bill requires that a dealer that desires to make a change
 24  9 in ownership of the dealership give notice to the manufacturer
 24 10 or distributor of the proposed change.  The manufacturer or
 24 11 distributor is not allowed to object to the proposal unless the
 24 12 objection is due to factors specified in the bill concerning
 24 13 the proposed transferee.  The manufacturer must make a written
 24 14 objection and has the burden of proving that the objection
 24 15 complies with the bill's requirements.
 24 16    A manufacturer or distributor is prohibited from failing to
 24 17 provide a dealer with the opportunity to designate a family
 24 18 member as a successor to the dealership in the event of the
 24 19 dealer's death, incapacity, or retirement so long as the
 24 20 dealer gives written notice of the designation before it takes
 24 21 effect.  The manufacturer or distributor cannot object to the
 24 22 designation unless the dealer is in breach of the manufacturer
 24 23 and dealer agreement or in violation of the provisions of new
 24 24 Code chapter 322E or the objection is due to other specified
 24 25 factors.  A manufacturer or distributor is prohibited from
 24 26 refusing to honor the succession of the designated family
 24 27 member unless the manufacturer or distributor has provided the
 24 28 dealer with written notice of an objection to the dealer's
 24 29 designation after receiving notice of the designation.
 24 30    In regards to warranty obligations on new recreational
 24 31 vehicles, the bill requires the warrantor, that person
 24 32 providing a written warranty on the vehicles, to specify the
 24 33 dealer's obligations for preparation, delivery, and warranty
 24 34 services on the warrantor's products and how the dealer will
 24 35 be compensated for provision of those services.  The bill
 25  1 specifies the warrantor's and dealer's obligations to each
 25  2 other concerning warranties.
 25  3    The bill provides that both the warrantor and the dealer have
 25  4 duties to indemnify and hold each other harmless to the extent
 25  5 that losses or damages are caused by the negligence or willful
 25  6 misconduct of the other.  These duties continue even after a
 25  7 new recreational vehicle is titled.
 25  8    The bill specifies the rights and obligations of a dealer and
 25  9 a manufacturer or distributor when a new recreational vehicle
 25 10 is damaged in transit.  The bill specifies a time frame for a
 25 11 dealer to inspect a delivered vehicle and to either reject or
 25 12 request to repair the damaged vehicle.
 25 13    The bill provides that a manufacturer or distributor shall
 25 14 not coerce or attempt to coerce a dealer to purchase a product
 25 15 the dealer did not order, to enter into an agreement with the
 25 16 manufacturer or distributor, or to enter into an agreement
 25 17 with the manufacturer or distributor that requires the dealer
 25 18 to submit disputes to binding arbitration or otherwise waive
 25 19 rights or responsibilities provided for under the bill.  The
 25 20 bill specifies some of the activities that could be considered
 25 21 coercion for purposes of the bill.
 25 22    A dealer, manufacturer, distributor, or warrantor injured
 25 23 by another party's violation of the provisions of new Code
 25 24 chapter 322E may bring a civil action in district court to
 25 25 recover actual damages.  However, prior to bringing suit, the
 25 26 party alleging the violation may serve a request for mediation
 25 27 upon the alleged offending party.  If both parties agree to
 25 28 mediation, the parties mutually select and share the cost of
 25 29 retaining an independent mediator to attempt to resolve the
 25 30 dispute or alleged violation.  Service of the mediation request
 25 31 tolls the time for filing any other proceeding or action and
 25 32 the district court is required to suspend any proceeding or
 25 33 action until the mediation meeting occurs.  In addition to any
 25 34 other remedy, either party may apply to the district court for
 25 35 a temporary or permanent injunction.
 26  1 The bill provides that a manufacturer and dealer agreement
 26  2 cannot restrict jurisdiction over the agreement to a forum
 26  3 outside of this state, cannot provide that the dealer consents
 26  4 to jurisdiction outside of this state, and cannot limit actions
 26  5 or proceedings to a designated jurisdiction.
 26  6    The bill provides that a manufacturer and dealer agreement
 26  7 cannot require the application of laws of another state in lieu
 26  8 of this state's laws or provide that the agreement is to be
 26  9 governed by or construed in accordance with the laws of another
 26 10 state.
 26 11    A manufacturer and dealer agreement also cannot require a
 26 12 dealer to waive compliance with, or relieve a person of a duty
 26 13 or liability imposed, or a right provided, under the bill.
 26 14 This provision does not prohibit the settlement of disputes
 26 15 where separate and adequate consideration is given for a waiver
 26 16 or release.
 26 17    Notwithstanding Code chapter 322A, relating to motor vehicle
 26 18 franchisers, a recreational vehicle as defined in the bill
 26 19 is not governed by Code chapter 322A for the sale of a new
 26 20 recreational vehicle through a dealer in this state by a
 26 21 manufacturer or distributor, or pursuant to a manufacturer and
 26 22 dealer agreement regulated by the bill's provisions.
 26 23    The bill provides that new Code chapter 322E shall be
 26 24 administered by the director of transportation.

 26 29 trailers shall not exceed 45 feet, instead of 40 feet in
 26 30 length.
 26 31    Code section 322.3(1) is amended to prohibit a person
 26 32 from selling a motor vehicle that also meets the definition
 26 33 of a "recreational vehicle" pursuant to new Code chapter
 26 34 322E, unless the person is authorized to do so pursuant to a
 26 35 manufacturer and dealer agreement that meets the requirements
 27  1 of new Code chapter 322E.
 27  2    Code chapter 322C (travel trailer dealers, manufacturers,
 27  3 and distributors) is amended to include definitions of
 27  4 recreational vehicles that are consistent with the definitions
 27  5 in new Code chapter 322E.  Code section 322C.3(1) is amended
 27  6 to provide that the required manufacturer or distributor and
 27  7 dealer agreement must be made in accordance with the provisions
 27  8 of new Code chapter 322E.  Code section 322C.3 is amended to
 27  9 strike two provisions concerning manufacturers or distributors,
 27 10 and dealers of travel trailers that are inconsistent with
 27 11 provisions contained in new Code chapter 322E.
 27 12    Code section 537A.10(1)(c)(3) is amended to provide that for

 23 18 vehicles and includes coordinating amendments and applicability
 23 19 provisions.
 23 20    DIVISION I.  New Code chapter 322E regulates manufacturer
 23 21 and dealer agreements fixing the rights and responsibilities of
 23 22 each party pertaining to the sale of new recreational vehicles
 23 23 in the state.  A "recreational vehicle" is a vehicle that is
 23 24 either self=propelled or towed by a consumer=owned tow vehicle
 23 25 and is primarily designed to provide temporary living quarters
 23 26 for recreational, camping, or travel use.  A "recreational
 23 27 vehicle" includes a "motor home", and a "travel trailer" such
 23 28 as a fifth=wheel trailer, folding camping trailer, or a park
 23 29 model recreational vehicle.
 23 30    A manufacturer or distributor, and a dealer are required
 23 31 to enter into a written manufacturer and dealer agreement
 23 32 before selling new recreational vehicles in the state.  The
 23 33 agreement must designate the dealer's exclusive area of sales
 23 34 responsibility.  A manufacturer or distributor, or a dealer
 23 35 may terminate, cancel, or fail to renew the agreement with
 24  1 good cause and the bill specifies notification requirements,
 24  2 what factors may be considered in determining whether good
 24  3 cause exists, and requirements concerning repurchase or sale of
 24  4 remaining inventory of recreational vehicles and outstanding
 24  5 financial obligations between the parties to the agreement.
 24  6 The party that terminates, cancels, or fails to renew the
 24  7 agreement for good cause has the burden of showing cause.
 24  8    The bill requires that a dealer that desires to make a change
 24  9 in ownership of the dealership give notice to the manufacturer
 24 10 or distributor of the proposed change.  The manufacturer or
 24 11 distributor is not allowed to object to the proposal unless the
 24 12 objection is due to factors specified in the bill concerning
 24 13 the proposed transferee.  The manufacturer must make a written
 24 14 objection and has the burden of proving that the objection
 24 15 complies with the bill's requirements.
 24 16    A manufacturer or distributor is prohibited from failing to
 24 17 provide a dealer with the opportunity to designate a family
 24 18 member as a successor to the dealership in the event of the
 24 19 dealer's death, incapacity, or retirement so long as the
 24 20 dealer gives written notice of the designation before it takes
 24 21 effect.  The manufacturer or distributor cannot object to the
 24 22 designation unless the dealer is in breach of the manufacturer
 24 23 and dealer agreement or in violation of the provisions of new
 24 24 Code chapter 322E or the objection is due to other specified
 24 25 factors.  A manufacturer or distributor is prohibited from
 24 26 refusing to honor the succession of the designated family
 24 27 member unless the manufacturer or distributor has provided the
 24 28 dealer with written notice of an objection to the dealer's
 24 29 designation after receiving notice of the designation.
 24 30    In regards to warranty obligations on new recreational
 24 31 vehicles, the bill requires the warrantor, that person
 24 32 providing a written warranty on the vehicles, to specify the
 24 33 dealer's obligations for preparation, delivery, and warranty
 24 34 services on the warrantor's products and how the dealer will
 24 35 be compensated for provision of those services.  The bill
 25  1 specifies the warrantor's and dealer's obligations to each
 25  2 other concerning warranties.
 25  3    The bill provides that both the warrantor and the dealer have
 25  4 duties to indemnify and hold each other harmless to the extent
 25  5 that losses or damages are caused by the negligence or willful
 25  6 misconduct of the other.  These duties continue even after a
 25  7 new recreational vehicle is titled.
 25  8    The bill specifies the rights and obligations of a dealer and
 25  9 a manufacturer or distributor when a new recreational vehicle
 25 10 is damaged in transit.  The bill specifies a time frame for a
 25 11 dealer to inspect a delivered vehicle and to either reject or
 25 12 request to repair the damaged vehicle.
 25 13    The bill provides that a manufacturer or distributor shall
 25 14 not coerce or attempt to coerce a dealer to purchase a product
 25 15 the dealer did not order, to enter into an agreement with the
 25 16 manufacturer or distributor, or to enter into an agreement
 25 17 with the manufacturer or distributor that requires the dealer
 25 18 to submit disputes to binding arbitration or otherwise waive
 25 19 rights or responsibilities provided for under the bill.  The
 25 20 bill specifies some of the activities that could be considered
 25 21 coercion for purposes of the bill.
 25 22    A dealer, manufacturer, distributor, or warrantor injured
 25 23 by another party's violation of the provisions of new Code
 25 24 chapter 322E may bring a civil action in district court to
 25 25 recover actual damages.  However, prior to bringing suit, the
 25 26 party alleging the violation may serve a request for mediation
 25 27 upon the alleged offending party.  If both parties agree to
 25 28 mediation, the parties mutually select and share the cost of
 25 29 retaining an independent mediator to attempt to resolve the
 25 30 dispute or alleged violation.  Service of the mediation request
 25 31 tolls the time for filing any other proceeding or action and
 25 32 the district court is required to suspend any proceeding or
 25 33 action until the mediation meeting occurs.  In addition to any
 25 34 other remedy, either party may apply to the district court for
 25 35 a temporary or permanent injunction.
 26  1 The bill provides that a manufacturer and dealer agreement
 26  2 cannot restrict jurisdiction over the agreement to a forum
 26  3 outside of this state, cannot provide that the dealer consents
 26  4 to jurisdiction outside of this state, and cannot limit actions
 26  5 or proceedings to a designated jurisdiction.
 26  6    The bill provides that a manufacturer and dealer agreement
 26  7 cannot require the application of laws of another state in lieu
 26  8 of this state's laws or provide that the agreement is to be
 26  9 governed by or construed in accordance with the laws of another
 26 10 state.
 26 11    A manufacturer and dealer agreement also cannot require a
 26 12 dealer to waive compliance with, or relieve a person of a duty
 26 13 or liability imposed, or a right provided, under the bill.
 26 14 This provision does not prohibit the settlement of disputes
 26 15 where separate and adequate consideration is given for a waiver
 26 16 or release.
 26 17    Notwithstanding Code chapter 322A, relating to motor vehicle
 26 18 franchisers, a recreational vehicle as defined in the bill
 26 19 is not governed by Code chapter 322A for the sale of a new
 26 20 recreational vehicle through a dealer in this state by a
 26 21 manufacturer or distributor, or pursuant to a manufacturer and
 26 22 dealer agreement regulated by the bill's provisions.

 23 21 and dealer agreements fixing the rights and responsibilities of
 23 22 each party pertaining to the sale of new recreational vehicles
 23 23 in the state.  A "recreational vehicle" is a vehicle that is
 23 24 either self=propelled or towed by a consumer=owned tow vehicle
 23 25 and is primarily designed to provide temporary living quarters
 23 26 for recreational, camping, or travel use.  A "recreational
 23 27 vehicle" includes a "motor home", and a "travel trailer" such
 23 28 as a fifth=wheel trailer, folding camping trailer, or a park
 23 29 model recreational vehicle.
 23 30    A manufacturer or distributor, and a dealer are required
 23 31 to enter into a written manufacturer and dealer agreement
 23 32 before selling new recreational vehicles in the state.  The
 23 33 agreement must designate the dealer's exclusive area of sales
 23 34 responsibility.  A manufacturer or distributor, or a dealer
 23 35 may terminate, cancel, or fail to renew the agreement with
 24  1 good cause and the bill specifies notification requirements,
 24  2 what factors may be considered in determining whether good
 24  3 cause exists, and requirements concerning repurchase or sale of
 24  4 remaining inventory of recreational vehicles and outstanding
 24  5 financial obligations between the parties to the agreement.
 24  6 The party that terminates, cancels, or fails to renew the
 24  7 agreement for good cause has the burden of showing cause.
 24  8    The bill requires that a dealer that desires to make a change
 24  9 in ownership of the dealership give notice to the manufacturer
 24 10 or distributor of the proposed change.  The manufacturer or
 24 11 distributor is not allowed to object to the proposal unless the
 24 12 objection is due to factors specified in the bill concerning
 24 13 the proposed transferee.  The manufacturer must make a written
 24 14 objection and has the burden of proving that the objection
 24 15 complies with the bill's requirements.
 24 16    A manufacturer or distributor is prohibited from failing to
 24 17 provide a dealer with the opportunity to designate a family
 24 18 member as a successor to the dealership in the event of the
 24 19 dealer's death, incapacity, or retirement so long as the
 24 20 dealer gives written notice of the designation before it takes
 24 21 effect.  The manufacturer or distributor cannot object to the
 24 22 designation unless the dealer is in breach of the manufacturer
 24 23 and dealer agreement or in violation of the provisions of new
 24 24 Code chapter 322E or the objection is due to other specified
 24 25 factors.  A manufacturer or distributor is prohibited from
 24 26 refusing to honor the succession of the designated family
 24 27 member unless the manufacturer or distributor has provided the
 24 28 dealer with written notice of an objection to the dealer's
 24 29 designation after receiving notice of the designation.
 24 30    In regards to warranty obligations on new recreational
 24 31 vehicles, the bill requires the warrantor, that person
 24 32 providing a written warranty on the vehicles, to specify the
 24 33 dealer's obligations for preparation, delivery, and warranty
 24 34 services on the warrantor's products and how the dealer will
 24 35 be compensated for provision of those services.  The bill
 25  1 specifies the warrantor's and dealer's obligations to each
 25  2 other concerning warranties.
 25  3    The bill provides that both the warrantor and the dealer have
 25  4 duties to indemnify and hold each other harmless to the extent
 25  5 that losses or damages are caused by the negligence or willful
 25  6 misconduct of the other.  These duties continue even after a
 25  7 new recreational vehicle is titled.
 25  8    The bill specifies the rights and obligations of a dealer and
 25  9 a manufacturer or distributor when a new recreational vehicle
 25 10 is damaged in transit.  The bill specifies a time frame for a
 25 11 dealer to inspect a delivered vehicle and to either reject or
 25 12 request to repair the damaged vehicle.
 25 13    The bill provides that a manufacturer or distributor shall
 25 14 not coerce or attempt to coerce a dealer to purchase a product
 25 15 the dealer did not order, to enter into an agreement with the
 25 16 manufacturer or distributor, or to enter into an agreement
 25 17 with the manufacturer or distributor that requires the dealer
 25 18 to submit disputes to binding arbitration or otherwise waive
 25 19 rights or responsibilities provided for under the bill.  The
 25 20 bill specifies some of the activities that could be considered
 25 21 coercion for purposes of the bill.
 25 22    A dealer, manufacturer, distributor, or warrantor injured
 25 23 by another party's violation of the provisions of new Code
 25 24 chapter 322E may bring a civil action in district court to
 25 25 recover actual damages.  However, prior to bringing suit, the
 25 26 party alleging the violation may serve a request for mediation
 25 27 upon the alleged offending party.  If both parties agree to
 25 28 mediation, the parties mutually select and share the cost of
 25 29 retaining an independent mediator to attempt to resolve the
 25 30 dispute or alleged violation.  Service of the mediation request
 25 31 tolls the time for filing any other proceeding or action and
 25 32 the district court is required to suspend any proceeding or
 25 33 action until the mediation meeting occurs.  In addition to any
 25 34 other remedy, either party may apply to the district court for
 25 35 a temporary or permanent injunction.

 26  2 cannot restrict jurisdiction over the agreement to a forum
 26  3 outside of this state, cannot provide that the dealer consents
 26  4 to jurisdiction outside of this state, and cannot limit actions
 26  5 or proceedings to a designated jurisdiction.
 26  6    The bill provides that a manufacturer and dealer agreement
 26  7 cannot require the application of laws of another state in lieu
 26  8 of this state's laws or provide that the agreement is to be
 26  9 governed by or construed in accordance with the laws of another
 26 10 state.
 26 11    A manufacturer and dealer agreement also cannot require a
 26 12 dealer to waive compliance with, or relieve a person of a duty
 26 13 or liability imposed, or a right provided, under the bill.
 26 14 This provision does not prohibit the settlement of disputes
 26 15 where separate and adequate consideration is given for a waiver
 26 16 or release.
 26 17    Notwithstanding Code chapter 322A, relating to motor vehicle
 26 18 franchisers, a recreational vehicle as defined in the bill
 26 19 is not governed by Code chapter 322A for the sale of a new

 24 14 objection and has the burden of proving that the objection
 24 15 complies with the bill's requirements.

 24 19 dealer's death, incapacity, or retirement so long as the
 24 20 dealer gives written notice of the designation before it takes
 24 21 effect.  The manufacturer or distributor cannot object to the
 24 22 designation unless the dealer is in breach of the manufacturer
 24 23 and dealer agreement or in violation of the provisions of new
 24 24 Code chapter 322E or the objection is due to other specified
 24 25 factors.  A manufacturer or distributor is prohibited from
 24 26 refusing to honor the succession of the designated family
 24 27 member unless the manufacturer or distributor has provided the

 25 12 request to repair the damaged vehicle.
 25 13    The bill provides that a manufacturer or distributor shall
 25 14 not coerce or attempt to coerce a dealer to purchase a product
 25 15 the dealer did not order, to enter into an agreement with the

 25 17 with the manufacturer or distributor that requires the dealer
 25 18 to submit disputes to binding arbitration or otherwise waive
 25 19 rights or responsibilities provided for under the bill.  The
 25 20 bill specifies some of the activities that could be considered

 25 25 recover actual damages.  However, prior to bringing suit, the
 25 26 party alleging the violation may serve a request for mediation
 25 27 upon the alleged offending party.  If both parties agree to
 25 28 mediation, the parties mutually select and share the cost of
 25 29 retaining an independent mediator to attempt to resolve the
 25 30 dispute or alleged violation.  Service of the mediation request
 25 31 tolls the time for filing any other proceeding or action and
 25 32 the district court is required to suspend any proceeding or
 25 33 action until the mediation meeting occurs.  In addition to any

 24 14 objection and has the burden of proving that the objection
 24 15 complies with the bill's requirements.
 24 16    A manufacturer or distributor is prohibited from failing to
 24 17 provide a dealer with the opportunity to designate a family

 24 19 dealer's death, incapacity, or retirement so long as the
 24 20 dealer gives written notice of the designation before it takes

 24 23 and dealer agreement or in violation of the provisions of new
 24 24 Code chapter 322E or the objection is due to other specified
 24 25 factors.  A manufacturer or distributor is prohibited from

 25 17 with the manufacturer or distributor that requires the dealer
 25 18 to submit disputes to binding arbitration or otherwise waive

 24  9 in ownership of the dealership give notice to the manufacturer
 24 10 or distributor of the proposed change.  The manufacturer or
 24 11 distributor is not allowed to object to the proposal unless the
 24 12 objection is due to factors specified in the bill concerning
 24 13 the proposed transferee.  The manufacturer must make a written
 24 14 objection and has the burden of proving that the objection
 24 15 complies with the bill's requirements.
 24 16    A manufacturer or distributor is prohibited from failing to
 24 17 provide a dealer with the opportunity to designate a family
 24 18 member as a successor to the dealership in the event of the
 24 19 dealer's death, incapacity, or retirement so long as the
 24 20 dealer gives written notice of the designation before it takes
 24 21 effect.  The manufacturer or distributor cannot object to the
 24 22 designation unless the dealer is in breach of the manufacturer
 24 23 and dealer agreement or in violation of the provisions of new
 24 24 Code chapter 322E or the objection is due to other specified
 24 25 factors.  A manufacturer or distributor is prohibited from
 24 26 refusing to honor the succession of the designated family
 24 27 member unless the manufacturer or distributor has provided the
 24 28 dealer with written notice of an objection to the dealer's
 24 29 designation after receiving notice of the designation.
 24 30    In regards to warranty obligations on new recreational
 24 31 vehicles, the bill requires the warrantor, that person
 24 32 providing a written warranty on the vehicles, to specify the
 24 33 dealer's obligations for preparation, delivery, and warranty
 24 34 services on the warrantor's products and how the dealer will
 24 35 be compensated for provision of those services.  The bill
 25  1 specifies the warrantor's and dealer's obligations to each
 25  2 other concerning warranties.
 25  3    The bill provides that both the warrantor and the dealer have
 25  4 duties to indemnify and hold each other harmless to the extent
 25  5 that losses or damages are caused by the negligence or willful
 25  6 misconduct of the other.  These duties continue even after a
 25  7 new recreational vehicle is titled.
 25  8    The bill specifies the rights and obligations of a dealer and
 25  9 a manufacturer or distributor when a new recreational vehicle
 25 10 is damaged in transit.  The bill specifies a time frame for a
 25 11 dealer to inspect a delivered vehicle and to either reject or
 25 12 request to repair the damaged vehicle.
 25 13    The bill provides that a manufacturer or distributor shall
 25 14 not coerce or attempt to coerce a dealer to purchase a product
 25 15 the dealer did not order, to enter into an agreement with the
 25 16 manufacturer or distributor, or to enter into an agreement
 25 17 with the manufacturer or distributor that requires the dealer
 25 18 to submit disputes to binding arbitration or otherwise waive
 25 19 rights or responsibilities provided for under the bill.  The
 25 20 bill specifies some of the activities that could be considered
 25 21 coercion for purposes of the bill.
 25 22    A dealer, manufacturer, distributor, or warrantor injured
 25 23 by another party's violation of the provisions of new Code
 25 24 chapter 322E may bring a civil action in district court to
 25 25 recover actual damages.  However, prior to bringing suit, the
 25 26 party alleging the violation may serve a request for mediation
 25 27 upon the alleged offending party.  If both parties agree to
 25 28 mediation, the parties mutually select and share the cost of
 25 29 retaining an independent mediator to attempt to resolve the
 25 30 dispute or alleged violation.  Service of the mediation request
 25 31 tolls the time for filing any other proceeding or action and
 25 32 the district court is required to suspend any proceeding or
 25 33 action until the mediation meeting occurs.  In addition to any
 25 34 other remedy, either party may apply to the district court for
 25 35 a temporary or permanent injunction.
 26  1 The bill provides that a manufacturer and dealer agreement
 26  2 cannot restrict jurisdiction over the agreement to a forum

 26 10 state.
 26 11    A manufacturer and dealer agreement also cannot require a
 26 12 dealer to waive compliance with, or relieve a person of a duty
 26 13 or liability imposed, or a right provided, under the bill.
 26 14 This provision does not prohibit the settlement of disputes
 26 15 where separate and adequate consideration is given for a waiver
 26 16 or release.
 26 17    Notwithstanding Code chapter 322A, relating to motor vehicle
 26 18 franchisers, a recreational vehicle as defined in the bill
 26 19 is not governed by Code chapter 322A for the sale of a new

 26 13 or liability imposed, or a right provided, under the bill.
 26 14 This provision does not prohibit the settlement of disputes
 26 15 where separate and adequate consideration is given for a waiver

 26 18 franchisers, a recreational vehicle as defined in the bill

 24 35 be compensated for provision of those services.  The bill

 25  2 other concerning warranties.
 25  3    The bill provides that both the warrantor and the dealer have
 25  4 duties to indemnify and hold each other harmless to the extent
 25  5 that losses or damages are caused by the negligence or willful
 25  6 misconduct of the other.  These duties continue even after a

 24 13 the proposed transferee.  The manufacturer must make a written
 24 14 objection and has the burden of proving that the objection
 24 15 complies with the bill's requirements.
 24 16    A manufacturer or distributor is prohibited from failing to
 24 17 provide a dealer with the opportunity to designate a family
 24 18 member as a successor to the dealership in the event of the
 24 19 dealer's death, incapacity, or retirement so long as the
 24 20 dealer gives written notice of the designation before it takes

 24 22 designation unless the dealer is in breach of the manufacturer
 24 23 and dealer agreement or in violation of the provisions of new
 24 24 Code chapter 322E or the objection is due to other specified
 24 25 factors.  A manufacturer or distributor is prohibited from
 24 26 refusing to honor the succession of the designated family
 24 27 member unless the manufacturer or distributor has provided the
 24 28 dealer with written notice of an objection to the dealer's
 24 29 designation after receiving notice of the designation.

 24 31 vehicles, the bill requires the warrantor, that person

 25  4 duties to indemnify and hold each other harmless to the extent
 25  5 that losses or damages are caused by the negligence or willful
 25  6 misconduct of the other.  These duties continue even after a
 25  7 new recreational vehicle is titled.
 25  8    The bill specifies the rights and obligations of a dealer and
 25  9 a manufacturer or distributor when a new recreational vehicle
 25 10 is damaged in transit.  The bill specifies a time frame for a

 25 17 with the manufacturer or distributor that requires the dealer
 25 18 to submit disputes to binding arbitration or otherwise waive
 25 19 rights or responsibilities provided for under the bill.  The
 25 20 bill specifies some of the activities that could be considered
 25 21 coercion for purposes of the bill.

 25 25 recover actual damages.  However, prior to bringing suit, the
 25 26 party alleging the violation may serve a request for mediation
 25 27 upon the alleged offending party.  If both parties agree to
 25 28 mediation, the parties mutually select and share the cost of
 25 29 retaining an independent mediator to attempt to resolve the
 25 30 dispute or alleged violation.  Service of the mediation request
 25 31 tolls the time for filing any other proceeding or action and
 25 32 the district court is required to suspend any proceeding or
 25 33 action until the mediation meeting occurs.  In addition to any
 25 34 other remedy, either party may apply to the district court for
 25 35 a temporary or permanent injunction.

 26 11    A manufacturer and dealer agreement also cannot require a
 26 12 dealer to waive compliance with, or relieve a person of a duty
 26 13 or liability imposed, or a right provided, under the bill.
 26 14 This provision does not prohibit the settlement of disputes
 26 15 where separate and adequate consideration is given for a waiver

 24 23 and dealer agreement or in violation of the provisions of new
 24 24 Code chapter 322E or the objection is due to other specified
 24 25 factors.  A manufacturer or distributor is prohibited from
 24 26 refusing to honor the succession of the designated family

 25 25 recover actual damages.  However, prior to bringing suit, the
 25 26 party alleging the violation may serve a request for mediation
 25 27 upon the alleged offending party.  If both parties agree to
 25 28 mediation, the parties mutually select and share the cost of
 25 29 retaining an independent mediator to attempt to resolve the
 25 30 dispute or alleged violation.  Service of the mediation request
 25 31 tolls the time for filing any other proceeding or action and
 25 32 the district court is required to suspend any proceeding or
 25 33 action until the mediation meeting occurs.  In addition to any

 24 14 objection and has the burden of proving that the objection
 24 15 complies with the bill's requirements.
 24 16    A manufacturer or distributor is prohibited from failing to

 24 23 and dealer agreement or in violation of the provisions of new

 25 26 party alleging the violation may serve a request for mediation
 25 27 upon the alleged offending party.  If both parties agree to
 25 28 mediation, the parties mutually select and share the cost of
 25 29 retaining an independent mediator to attempt to resolve the
