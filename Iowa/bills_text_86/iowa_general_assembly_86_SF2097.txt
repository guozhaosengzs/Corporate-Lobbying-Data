  4 22 the discretion of the district court and upon instituting such
  4 23 proceedings, to deposit the amount assessed with the clerk of
  4 24 the district court. Any moneys so deposited shall either be
  4 25 returned to the employer or be forwarded to the commissioner
  4 26 for deposit in the general fund of the state, depending on the
  4 27 outcome of the judicial review, including any appeal to the
  4 28 supreme court.
  4 29    5.  After the time for seeking judicial review has expired
  4 30 or after all judicial review has been exhausted and the
  4 31 commissioner's assessment has been upheld, the commissioner
  4 32 shall request the attorney general to recover the assessed
  4 33 penalties in a civil action.
