5


The
inclusion
of
this
explanation
does
not
constitute
agreement
with
6


the
explanation’s
substance
by
the
members
of
the

7


This

permits
the

(authority)
to
provide
additional
tax
incentives
to
businesses
9


using
apprenticeship
training
program
contractors
and
10


subcontractors
for
projects
in
which
qualifying
investments
are
11


made
under
the
high
quality
jobs
program.
12


Under
the
bill,
the
authority
is
permitted
to
provide
an
13


additional
investment
tax
credit
to
a
business
if
the
business
14


contracts
with
a
contractor
or
subcontractor
who
operates
or
15


participates
in
an
apprenticeship
program
for
the
construction
16


or
equipping
of
a
facility

17


Under
the
bill,
if
an
eligible
business
directs
70
percent
18


of
the
qualifying
investment
to
qualifying
contractors
19


or
subcontractors,
the
business
is
eligible
to
receive
an
20


additional
investment
tax
credit
of
up

subcontractors,
