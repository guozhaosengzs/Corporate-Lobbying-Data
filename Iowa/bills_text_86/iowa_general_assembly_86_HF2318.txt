  4 14 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  4 15 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  4 16    This bill provides for the issuance of a temporary visitor
  4 17 driver's license to a person who is an Iowa resident, is
  4 18 employed or is a student, and who presents a foreign passport
  4 19 or consular identification document as proof of identification
  4 20 and date of birth.
  4 21    The bill defines "consular identification document" as an
  4 22 official identification card issued by a foreign government,
  4 23 through the foreign government's consular offices, for the
  4 24 purpose of identifying a foreign national who is living outside
  4 25 the foreign jurisdiction.  The definition specifies security
  4 26 attributes that a consular identification document must have
  4 27 and information the document must contain.  The document
  4 28 must include an English translation of the data fields.  The
  4 29 definition also requires that a copy of the standard document
  4 30 issued by the consular office or foreign government be filed
  4 31 with the department of transportation (DOT) along with
  4 32 certification of procedures used to ascertain the identity of a
  4 33 person to whom a consular identification document is issued and
  4 34 procedures used to satisfy the specified security requirements
  4 35 of the document.
  5  1 Under the bill, the DOT may issue a temporary visitor
  5  2 driver's license to a person who is employed or is a student,
  5  3 and who is otherwise qualified for a driver's license but does
  5  4 not present a social security number or document of authorized
  5  5 presence issued by the department of homeland security, United
  5  6 States citizenship and immigration services.  The DOT may
  5  7 accept an unexpired passport from the applicant's country
  5  8 of citizenship or a valid unexpired consular identification
  5  9 document as proof of identification and date of birth.
  5 10    The bill specifies that a person with a temporary visitor
  5 11 driver's license is subject to all of the Code provisions and
  5 12 administrative rules applicable to a person with any other
  5 13 type of driver's license, including provisions relating to
  5 14 drivers under 18 years of age, examination requirements, and
  5 15 financial liability coverage requirements.  For purposes of
  5 16 Code chapter 321 relating to the regulation of motor vehicles
  5 17 and motor vehicle operators, a temporary visitor driver's
  5 18 license constitutes proof of identification to the same extent
  5 19 as any other driver's license. However, the license shall not
  5 20 be used to determine voting eligibility or eligibility for any
  5 21 license issued or benefit or service provided by this state or
  5 22 a political subdivision of this state.
  5 23    The design of the temporary visitor driver's license shall
  5 24 be the same as another driver's license of the same class,
  5 25 except that the DOT may make minimal changes as necessary to
  5 26 comply with requirements of the federal REAL ID Act of 2005
  5 27 relating to driver's licenses that may not be used for federal
  5 28 purposes according to that Act. The bill provides that a
  5 29 temporary visitor driver's license shall be valid for two years
  5 30 and may be renewed.  The DOT is prohibited from distinguishing
  5 31 between temporary visitor driver's license status and any other
  5 32 licensure status in any disclosure pertaining to a licensee.
  5 33 The DOT may adopt rules relating to the issuance of temporary
  5 34 visitor driver's licenses and instruction permits, including
  5 35 providing for appropriate license fees.
