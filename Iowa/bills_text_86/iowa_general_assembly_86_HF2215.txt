  2 13 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  2 14 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  2 15    This bill allows the state transportation commission
  2 16 (STC), after consultation with the department of workforce
  2 17 development (DWD) and stakeholders, including regional planning
  2 18 affiliations, metropolitan planning organizations, the Iowa
  2 19 state association of counties, and the Iowa league of cities,
  2 20 to allocate moneys from the primary road fund (PRF) for the
  2 21 establishment, construction, and maintenance of the secondary
  2 22 road system and municipal street system in counties and cities
  2 23 where the local average wage for a construction worker is lower
  2 24 than or equal to the statewide average wage for a construction
  2 25 worker in exchange for retaining all or a portion of federal
  2 26 aid road funds that would otherwise be allocated to those
  2 27 counties and cities.
  2 28    In addition, the bill requires the STC and the department of
  2 29 transportation, in consultation with the DWD, to prioritize the
  2 30 use of federal aid primary and urban road moneys in the PRF for
  2 31 primary road and bridge construction projects in areas of the

  3  3 for a construction worker.
  3  4    The bill does not apply to federal aid primary and urban
  3  5 road moneys appropriated for a purpose inconsistent with the
