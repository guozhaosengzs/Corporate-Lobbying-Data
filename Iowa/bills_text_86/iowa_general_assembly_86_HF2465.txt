111  2                         ADMINISTRATION
111  3    Sec. 132.  NAME CHANGE TO REFERENDUM FOR DIRECT USE.  Nothing
111  4 in this Act requires the department of agriculture and land
111  5 stewardship or a commodity organization described in section
111  6 466B.51, as enacted in this Act, to conduct a referendum
111  7 because of this Act's reference to a referendum as a referendum
111  8 for direct use.
111  9                           EXPLANATION
111 10 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
111 11 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
111 12    This bill relates to agricultural commodity organizations
111 13 representing producers of that commodity that are authorized
111 14 to impose an excise tax or "assessment" (and commonly
111 15 referred to as a "checkoff") on the commodity when first
111 16 sold by the producer to a first purchaser.  The goal of the
111 17 assessment is to fund promotional activities which involve
111 18 market development, research, and education.  The commodity
111 19 organizations include the Iowa dairy industry commission or
111 20 Iowa state dairy association (Code chapter 179), Iowa beef
111 21 cattle producers association (Code chapter 181), Iowa sheep and
111 22 wool promotion board (Code chapter 182), Iowa pork producers
111 23 council or Iowa pork producers association (Code chapter 183A),
111 24 Iowa egg council (Code chapter 184), the Iowa turkey marketing
111 25 council (Code chapter 184A), the Iowa soybean association
111 26 (Code chapter 185), and the Iowa corn promotion board (Code
111 27 chapter 185C).  The bill requires a commodity organization
111 28 to establish a separate state assessment for clean water, if
111 29 approved by a majority of its members at a referendum.  The
111 30 bill also requires commodity organizations to conduct a special
111 31 referendum to increase the rate of the assessment for clean
111 32 water. The rate of the state assessment is established by the
111 33 governing body of the commodity organization not to exceed the
111 34 assessment for direct use or national assessment or both. The
111 35 referendum would be conducted in the same manner as an initial
112  1 or special referendum conducted by the commodity organization
112  2 under its specific Code chapter.  The special assessment could
112  3 be continued or terminated in the same manner as the commodity
112  4 organization's assessment for promotional activities.  Moneys
112  5 from the state assessment would be collected by the commodity
112  6 organization and transferred to a newly created clean water
112  7 fund.
112  8    The bill establishes a clean water commission housed in
112  9 the division of soil conservation and water quality of the
112 10 department of agriculture and land stewardship.  The commission
112 11 is composed of nine voting members appointed by the governor,
112 12 four legislative members who serve in a nonvoting, ex officio
112 13 capacity, and persons appointed by the commodity organizations,
112 14 who also serve in a nonvoting, ex officio capacity.
112 15 Appointments are contingent on the commodity organization
112 16 having approved the establishment of a state assessment for
112 17 clean water to be transferred to the clean water fund. The
112 18 purpose of the commission is to finance methods to improve
112 19 surface water quality, including by reducing contributing
112 20 contaminant loads to receiving surface waters and reducing soil
112 21 erosion and sediment loss. The commission is responsible for
112 22 overseeing the water quality initiative as administered by the
112 23 division of soil conservation and water quality.
112 24    Moneys collected from the state assessment are to be
112 25 credited to the clean water fund which is under the supervision
112 26 of the commission.  The fund is composed of a general account,
112 27 an assessment account, and an expenditures account. The fund's
112 28 general account includes moneys appropriated by the general
112 29 assembly and other moneys available to and obtained or accepted
112 30 by the commission.  Moneys collected from the state assessment
112 31 are to be credited to the assessment account.  The bill also
112 32 includes an expenditures account which only includes moneys
112 33 transferred from the general account and the assessment account
112 34 for purposes of financing methods to improve surface water
112 35 quality.  Moneys transferred from the assessment account are
113  1 to be used to reimburse the department of agriculture and land
113  2 stewardship or a commodity organization for reasonable costs
113  3 of conducting a referendum to determine if a state assessment
113  4 for clean water is to be established, continued, or terminated.
113  5 The commission can also apply to the executive council for
113  6 moneys required to pay for reasonable costs of conducting a
113  7 referendum.  Moneys deposited into the expenditures account
113  8 may also be used to pay refunds to producers who have paid the
113  9 state assessment if the refund application has been approved
113 10 by the commodity organization.  The commission must review
113 11 the balance of moneys in the general account and the balance
113 12 of moneys in the assessment account, prior to the end of
113 13 each fiscal year.  If the total amount of moneys expected
113 14 to be credited to the general account during the following
113 15 fiscal year will not at least equal the balance of moneys in
113 16 the assessment account the commission must order that each
113 17 commodity organization that is imposing and collecting a state
113 18 assessment immediately suspend the imposition of that state
113 19 assessment for the following fiscal year.
113 20    The bill appropriates $40 million from the general fund
113 21 of the state to the clean water commission for the fiscal
113 22 year beginning July 1, 2017, and ending June 30, 2018, to
113 23 be credited to the general account of the clean water fund.
113 24 However, the amount of the appropriation is to be reduced by
113 25 any moneys credited to the fund's assessment account due to
113 26 state assessments collected on or before June 30, 2017.
113 27    The commission, in cooperation with the department of
113 28 agriculture and land stewardship, the department of natural
113 29 resources, and the Iowa finance authority, must submit a
113 30 report to the governor and general assembly by January 15,
113 31 2018, which includes a description of current clean water
113 32 programs and projects and a detailed plan for consolidating all
113 33 water quality and soil conservation initiatives and programs
113 34 and associated projects administered by the department of
113 35 agriculture and land stewardship, the department of natural
114  1 resources, and the Iowa finance authority under the overall

111  3    Sec. 132.  NAME CHANGE TO REFERENDUM FOR DIRECT USE.  Nothing
111  4 in this Act requires the department of agriculture and land
111  5 stewardship or a commodity organization described in section
111  6 466B.51, as enacted in this Act, to conduct a referendum
111  7 because of this Act's reference to a referendum as a referendum
111  8 for direct use.
111  9                           EXPLANATION
111 10 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
111 11 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
111 12    This bill relates to agricultural commodity organizations
111 13 representing producers of that commodity that are authorized
111 14 to impose an excise tax or "assessment" (and commonly
111 15 referred to as a "checkoff") on the commodity when first
111 16 sold by the producer to a first purchaser.  The goal of the
111 17 assessment is to fund promotional activities which involve
111 18 market development, research, and education.  The commodity
111 19 organizations include the Iowa dairy industry commission or
111 20 Iowa state dairy association (Code chapter 179), Iowa beef
111 21 cattle producers association (Code chapter 181), Iowa sheep and
111 22 wool promotion board (Code chapter 182), Iowa pork producers
111 23 council or Iowa pork producers association (Code chapter 183A),
111 24 Iowa egg council (Code chapter 184), the Iowa turkey marketing
111 25 council (Code chapter 184A), the Iowa soybean association
111 26 (Code chapter 185), and the Iowa corn promotion board (Code
111 27 chapter 185C).  The bill requires a commodity organization
111 28 to establish a separate state assessment for clean water, if
111 29 approved by a majority of its members at a referendum.  The
111 30 bill also requires commodity organizations to conduct a special
111 31 referendum to increase the rate of the assessment for clean
111 32 water. The rate of the state assessment is established by the
111 33 governing body of the commodity organization not to exceed the
111 34 assessment for direct use or national assessment or both. The
111 35 referendum would be conducted in the same manner as an initial
112  1 or special referendum conducted by the commodity organization
112  2 under its specific Code chapter.  The special assessment could
112  3 be continued or terminated in the same manner as the commodity
112  4 organization's assessment for promotional activities.  Moneys
112  5 from the state assessment would be collected by the commodity
112  6 organization and transferred to a newly created clean water
112  7 fund.
112  8    The bill establishes a clean water commission housed in
112  9 the division of soil conservation and water quality of the
112 10 department of agriculture and land stewardship.  The commission
112 11 is composed of nine voting members appointed by the governor,
112 12 four legislative members who serve in a nonvoting, ex officio
112 13 capacity, and persons appointed by the commodity organizations,
112 14 who also serve in a nonvoting, ex officio capacity.
112 15 Appointments are contingent on the commodity organization
112 16 having approved the establishment of a state assessment for
112 17 clean water to be transferred to the clean water fund. The
112 18 purpose of the commission is to finance methods to improve
112 19 surface water quality, including by reducing contributing
112 20 contaminant loads to receiving surface waters and reducing soil
112 21 erosion and sediment loss. The commission is responsible for
112 22 overseeing the water quality initiative as administered by the
112 23 division of soil conservation and water quality.
112 24    Moneys collected from the state assessment are to be
112 25 credited to the clean water fund which is under the supervision
112 26 of the commission.  The fund is composed of a general account,
112 27 an assessment account, and an expenditures account. The fund's
112 28 general account includes moneys appropriated by the general
112 29 assembly and other moneys available to and obtained or accepted
112 30 by the commission.  Moneys collected from the state assessment
112 31 are to be credited to the assessment account.  The bill also
112 32 includes an expenditures account which only includes moneys
112 33 transferred from the general account and the assessment account
112 34 for purposes of financing methods to improve surface water
112 35 quality.  Moneys transferred from the assessment account are
113  1 to be used to reimburse the department of agriculture and land
113  2 stewardship or a commodity organization for reasonable costs
113  3 of conducting a referendum to determine if a state assessment
113  4 for clean water is to be established, continued, or terminated.
113  5 The commission can also apply to the executive council for
113  6 moneys required to pay for reasonable costs of conducting a
113  7 referendum.  Moneys deposited into the expenditures account
113  8 may also be used to pay refunds to producers who have paid the
113  9 state assessment if the refund application has been approved
113 10 by the commodity organization.  The commission must review
113 11 the balance of moneys in the general account and the balance
113 12 of moneys in the assessment account, prior to the end of
113 13 each fiscal year.  If the total amount of moneys expected
113 14 to be credited to the general account during the following
113 15 fiscal year will not at least equal the balance of moneys in
113 16 the assessment account the commission must order that each
113 17 commodity organization that is imposing and collecting a state
113 18 assessment immediately suspend the imposition of that state
113 19 assessment for the following fiscal year.
113 20    The bill appropriates $40 million from the general fund
113 21 of the state to the clean water commission for the fiscal
113 22 year beginning July 1, 2017, and ending June 30, 2018, to
113 23 be credited to the general account of the clean water fund.
113 24 However, the amount of the appropriation is to be reduced by
113 25 any moneys credited to the fund's assessment account due to
113 26 state assessments collected on or before June 30, 2017.
113 27    The commission, in cooperation with the department of
113 28 agriculture and land stewardship, the department of natural
113 29 resources, and the Iowa finance authority, must submit a
113 30 report to the governor and general assembly by January 15,
113 31 2018, which includes a description of current clean water
113 32 programs and projects and a detailed plan for consolidating all
113 33 water quality and soil conservation initiatives and programs
113 34 and associated projects administered by the department of
113 35 agriculture and land stewardship, the department of natural
114  1 resources, and the Iowa finance authority under the overall

112  8    The bill establishes a clean water commission housed in

110 27 2018, the following amount, or so much thereof as is necessary,
110 28 to be used for the purposes designated:
110 29    To be credited to the general account of the clean water fund
110 30 created in section 466B.51:

111  3    Sec. 132.  NAME CHANGE TO REFERENDUM FOR DIRECT USE.  Nothing
111  4 in this Act requires the department of agriculture and land
111  5 stewardship or a commodity organization described in section
111  6 466B.51, as enacted in this Act, to conduct a referendum
111  7 because of this Act's reference to a referendum as a referendum
111  8 for direct use.
111  9                           EXPLANATION
111 10 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
111 11 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
111 12    This bill relates to agricultural commodity organizations
111 13 representing producers of that commodity that are authorized
111 14 to impose an excise tax or "assessment" (and commonly
111 15 referred to as a "checkoff") on the commodity when first
111 16 sold by the producer to a first purchaser.  The goal of the
111 17 assessment is to fund promotional activities which involve
111 18 market development, research, and education.  The commodity
111 19 organizations include the Iowa dairy industry commission or
111 20 Iowa state dairy association (Code chapter 179), Iowa beef
111 21 cattle producers association (Code chapter 181), Iowa sheep and
111 22 wool promotion board (Code chapter 182), Iowa pork producers
111 23 council or Iowa pork producers association (Code chapter 183A),
111 24 Iowa egg council (Code chapter 184), the Iowa turkey marketing
111 25 council (Code chapter 184A), the Iowa soybean association
111 26 (Code chapter 185), and the Iowa corn promotion board (Code
111 27 chapter 185C).  The bill requires a commodity organization
111 28 to establish a separate state assessment for clean water, if
111 29 approved by a majority of its members at a referendum.  The
111 30 bill also requires commodity organizations to conduct a special
111 31 referendum to increase the rate of the assessment for clean
111 32 water. The rate of the state assessment is established by the
111 33 governing body of the commodity organization not to exceed the
111 34 assessment for direct use or national assessment or both. The
111 35 referendum would be conducted in the same manner as an initial
112  1 or special referendum conducted by the commodity organization
112  2 under its specific Code chapter.  The special assessment could
112  3 be continued or terminated in the same manner as the commodity
112  4 organization's assessment for promotional activities.  Moneys
112  5 from the state assessment would be collected by the commodity
112  6 organization and transferred to a newly created clean water
112  7 fund.
112  8    The bill establishes a clean water commission housed in
112  9 the division of soil conservation and water quality of the
112 10 department of agriculture and land stewardship.  The commission
112 11 is composed of nine voting members appointed by the governor,
112 12 four legislative members who serve in a nonvoting, ex officio
112 13 capacity, and persons appointed by the commodity organizations,
112 14 who also serve in a nonvoting, ex officio capacity.
112 15 Appointments are contingent on the commodity organization
112 16 having approved the establishment of a state assessment for
112 17 clean water to be transferred to the clean water fund. The
112 18 purpose of the commission is to finance methods to improve
112 19 surface water quality, including by reducing contributing
112 20 contaminant loads to receiving surface waters and reducing soil
112 21 erosion and sediment loss. The commission is responsible for
112 22 overseeing the water quality initiative as administered by the
112 23 division of soil conservation and water quality.
112 24    Moneys collected from the state assessment are to be
112 25 credited to the clean water fund which is under the supervision
112 26 of the commission.  The fund is composed of a general account,
112 27 an assessment account, and an expenditures account. The fund's
112 28 general account includes moneys appropriated by the general
112 29 assembly and other moneys available to and obtained or accepted
112 30 by the commission.  Moneys collected from the state assessment
112 31 are to be credited to the assessment account.  The bill also
112 32 includes an expenditures account which only includes moneys
112 33 transferred from the general account and the assessment account
112 34 for purposes of financing methods to improve surface water
112 35 quality.  Moneys transferred from the assessment account are
113  1 to be used to reimburse the department of agriculture and land
113  2 stewardship or a commodity organization for reasonable costs
113  3 of conducting a referendum to determine if a state assessment
113  4 for clean water is to be established, continued, or terminated.
113  5 The commission can also apply to the executive council for
113  6 moneys required to pay for reasonable costs of conducting a
113  7 referendum.  Moneys deposited into the expenditures account
113  8 may also be used to pay refunds to producers who have paid the
113  9 state assessment if the refund application has been approved
113 10 by the commodity organization.  The commission must review
113 11 the balance of moneys in the general account and the balance
113 12 of moneys in the assessment account, prior to the end of
113 13 each fiscal year.  If the total amount of moneys expected
113 14 to be credited to the general account during the following
113 15 fiscal year will not at least equal the balance of moneys in
113 16 the assessment account the commission must order that each
113 17 commodity organization that is imposing and collecting a state
113 18 assessment immediately suspend the imposition of that state
113 19 assessment for the following fiscal year.
113 20    The bill appropriates $40 million from the general fund
113 21 of the state to the clean water commission for the fiscal
113 22 year beginning July 1, 2017, and ending June 30, 2018, to
113 23 be credited to the general account of the clean water fund.
113 24 However, the amount of the appropriation is to be reduced by
113 25 any moneys credited to the fund's assessment account due to
113 26 state assessments collected on or before June 30, 2017.
113 27    The commission, in cooperation with the department of
113 28 agriculture and land stewardship, the department of natural
113 29 resources, and the Iowa finance authority, must submit a
113 30 report to the governor and general assembly by January 15,
113 31 2018, which includes a description of current clean water
113 32 programs and projects and a detailed plan for consolidating all
113 33 water quality and soil conservation initiatives and programs
113 34 and associated projects administered by the department of
113 35 agriculture and land stewardship, the department of natural
114  1 resources, and the Iowa finance authority under the overall
114  2 supervision of the commission.

111 19 organizations include the Iowa dairy industry commission or
111 20 Iowa state dairy association (Code chapter 179), Iowa beef
111 21 cattle producers association (Code chapter 181), Iowa sheep and
111 22 wool promotion board (Code chapter 182), Iowa pork producers
111 23 council or Iowa pork producers association (Code chapter 183A),
111 24 Iowa egg council (Code chapter 184), the Iowa turkey marketing
111 25 council (Code chapter 184A), the Iowa soybean association
111 26 (Code chapter 185), and the Iowa corn promotion board (Code
111 27 chapter 185C).  The bill requires a commodity organization
111 28 to establish a separate state assessment for clean water, if
111 29 approved by a majority of its members at a referendum.  The
111 30 bill also requires commodity organizations to conduct a special

111 32 water. The rate of the state assessment is established by the
111 33 governing body of the commodity organization not to exceed the
111 34 assessment for direct use or national assessment or both. The
111 35 referendum would be conducted in the same manner as an initial
112  1 or special referendum conducted by the commodity organization
112  2 under its specific Code chapter.  The special assessment could
112  3 be continued or terminated in the same manner as the commodity
112  4 organization's assessment for promotional activities.  Moneys
112  5 from the state assessment would be collected by the commodity
112  6 organization and transferred to a newly created clean water
112  7 fund.
112  8    The bill establishes a clean water commission housed in
112  9 the division of soil conservation and water quality of the
112 10 department of agriculture and land stewardship.  The commission
112 11 is composed of nine voting members appointed by the governor,
112 12 four legislative members who serve in a nonvoting, ex officio
112 13 capacity, and persons appointed by the commodity organizations,
112 14 who also serve in a nonvoting, ex officio capacity.
112 15 Appointments are contingent on the commodity organization

112 24    Moneys collected from the state assessment are to be
112 25 credited to the clean water fund which is under the supervision
112 26 of the commission.  The fund is composed of a general account,
112 27 an assessment account, and an expenditures account. The fund's
112 28 general account includes moneys appropriated by the general
112 29 assembly and other moneys available to and obtained or accepted
112 30 by the commission.  Moneys collected from the state assessment
112 31 are to be credited to the assessment account.  The bill also
112 32 includes an expenditures account which only includes moneys
112 33 transferred from the general account and the assessment account
112 34 for purposes of financing methods to improve surface water
112 35 quality.  Moneys transferred from the assessment account are
113  1 to be used to reimburse the department of agriculture and land
113  2 stewardship or a commodity organization for reasonable costs
113  3 of conducting a referendum to determine if a state assessment

113  5 The commission can also apply to the executive council for

113  7 referendum.  Moneys deposited into the expenditures account
113  8 may also be used to pay refunds to producers who have paid the
113  9 state assessment if the refund application has been approved
113 10 by the commodity organization.  The commission must review
113 11 the balance of moneys in the general account and the balance
113 12 of moneys in the assessment account, prior to the end of
113 13 each fiscal year.  If the total amount of moneys expected
113 14 to be credited to the general account during the following
113 15 fiscal year will not at least equal the balance of moneys in
113 16 the assessment account the commission must order that each
113 17 commodity organization that is imposing and collecting a state
113 18 assessment immediately suspend the imposition of that state
113 19 assessment for the following fiscal year.
113 20    The bill appropriates $40 million from the general fund
113 21 of the state to the clean water commission for the fiscal
113 22 year beginning July 1, 2017, and ending June 30, 2018, to

113 24 However, the amount of the appropriation is to be reduced by
113 25 any moneys credited to the fund's assessment account due to
113 26 state assessments collected on or before June 30, 2017.
113 27    The commission, in cooperation with the department of
113 28 agriculture and land stewardship, the department of natural

112 12 four legislative members who serve in a nonvoting, ex officio
112 13 capacity, and persons appointed by the commodity organizations,
112 14 who also serve in a nonvoting, ex officio capacity.
112 15 Appointments are contingent on the commodity organization
112 16 having approved the establishment of a state assessment for
112 17 clean water to be transferred to the clean water fund. The
112 18 purpose of the commission is to finance methods to improve
112 19 surface water quality, including by reducing contributing
112 20 contaminant loads to receiving surface waters and reducing soil
112 21 erosion and sediment loss. The commission is responsible for
112 22 overseeing the water quality initiative as administered by the
112 23 division of soil conservation and water quality.
112 24    Moneys collected from the state assessment are to be
112 25 credited to the clean water fund which is under the supervision
112 26 of the commission.  The fund is composed of a general account,
112 27 an assessment account, and an expenditures account. The fund's
112 28 general account includes moneys appropriated by the general
112 29 assembly and other moneys available to and obtained or accepted
112 30 by the commission.  Moneys collected from the state assessment
112 31 are to be credited to the assessment account.  The bill also
112 32 includes an expenditures account which only includes moneys
112 33 transferred from the general account and the assessment account
112 34 for purposes of financing methods to improve surface water
112 35 quality.  Moneys transferred from the assessment account are
113  1 to be used to reimburse the department of agriculture and land
113  2 stewardship or a commodity organization for reasonable costs
113  3 of conducting a referendum to determine if a state assessment
113  4 for clean water is to be established, continued, or terminated.
113  5 The commission can also apply to the executive council for
113  6 moneys required to pay for reasonable costs of conducting a
113  7 referendum.  Moneys deposited into the expenditures account
113  8 may also be used to pay refunds to producers who have paid the
113  9 state assessment if the refund application has been approved
113 10 by the commodity organization.  The commission must review
113 11 the balance of moneys in the general account and the balance
113 12 of moneys in the assessment account, prior to the end of
113 13 each fiscal year.  If the total amount of moneys expected
113 14 to be credited to the general account during the following
113 15 fiscal year will not at least equal the balance of moneys in
113 16 the assessment account the commission must order that each
113 17 commodity organization that is imposing and collecting a state
113 18 assessment immediately suspend the imposition of that state
113 19 assessment for the following fiscal year.
113 20    The bill appropriates $40 million from the general fund
113 21 of the state to the clean water commission for the fiscal
113 22 year beginning July 1, 2017, and ending June 30, 2018, to
113 23 be credited to the general account of the clean water fund.
113 24 However, the amount of the appropriation is to be reduced by
113 25 any moneys credited to the fund's assessment account due to
113 26 state assessments collected on or before June 30, 2017.
113 27    The commission, in cooperation with the department of
113 28 agriculture and land stewardship, the department of natural
113 29 resources, and the Iowa finance authority, must submit a
113 30 report to the governor and general assembly by January 15,
113 31 2018, which includes a description of current clean water
113 32 programs and projects and a detailed plan for consolidating all
113 33 water quality and soil conservation initiatives and programs
113 34 and associated projects administered by the department of
113 35 agriculture and land stewardship, the department of natural
114  1 resources, and the Iowa finance authority under the overall

111  3    Sec. 132.  NAME CHANGE TO REFERENDUM FOR DIRECT USE.  Nothing
111  4 in this Act requires the department of agriculture and land
111  5 stewardship or a commodity organization described in section
111  6 466B.51, as enacted in this Act, to conduct a referendum
111  7 because of this Act's reference to a referendum as a referendum
111  8 for direct use.
111  9                           EXPLANATION
111 10 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
111 11 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
111 12    This bill relates to agricultural commodity organizations
111 13 representing producers of that commodity that are authorized
111 14 to impose an excise tax or "assessment" (and commonly
111 15 referred to as a "checkoff") on the commodity when first
111 16 sold by the producer to a first purchaser.  The goal of the
111 17 assessment is to fund promotional activities which involve
111 18 market development, research, and education.  The commodity
111 19 organizations include the Iowa dairy industry commission or
111 20 Iowa state dairy association (Code chapter 179), Iowa beef
111 21 cattle producers association (Code chapter 181), Iowa sheep and
111 22 wool promotion board (Code chapter 182), Iowa pork producers
111 23 council or Iowa pork producers association (Code chapter 183A),
111 24 Iowa egg council (Code chapter 184), the Iowa turkey marketing
111 25 council (Code chapter 184A), the Iowa soybean association
111 26 (Code chapter 185), and the Iowa corn promotion board (Code
111 27 chapter 185C).  The bill requires a commodity organization
111 28 to establish a separate state assessment for clean water, if
111 29 approved by a majority of its members at a referendum.  The
111 30 bill also requires commodity organizations to conduct a special
111 31 referendum to increase the rate of the assessment for clean
111 32 water. The rate of the state assessment is established by the
111 33 governing body of the commodity organization not to exceed the
111 34 assessment for direct use or national assessment or both. The
111 35 referendum would be conducted in the same manner as an initial
112  1 or special referendum conducted by the commodity organization
112  2 under its specific Code chapter.  The special assessment could
112  3 be continued or terminated in the same manner as the commodity
112  4 organization's assessment for promotional activities.  Moneys
112  5 from the state assessment would be collected by the commodity
112  6 organization and transferred to a newly created clean water
112  7 fund.
112  8    The bill establishes a clean water commission housed in
112  9 the division of soil conservation and water quality of the
112 10 department of agriculture and land stewardship.  The commission
112 11 is composed of nine voting members appointed by the governor,
112 12 four legislative members who serve in a nonvoting, ex officio
112 13 capacity, and persons appointed by the commodity organizations,
112 14 who also serve in a nonvoting, ex officio capacity.
112 15 Appointments are contingent on the commodity organization
112 16 having approved the establishment of a state assessment for
112 17 clean water to be transferred to the clean water fund. The
112 18 purpose of the commission is to finance methods to improve
112 19 surface water quality, including by reducing contributing
112 20 contaminant loads to receiving surface waters and reducing soil
112 21 erosion and sediment loss. The commission is responsible for
112 22 overseeing the water quality initiative as administered by the
112 23 division of soil conservation and water quality.
112 24    Moneys collected from the state assessment are to be
112 25 credited to the clean water fund which is under the supervision
112 26 of the commission.  The fund is composed of a general account,
112 27 an assessment account, and an expenditures account. The fund's
112 28 general account includes moneys appropriated by the general
112 29 assembly and other moneys available to and obtained or accepted
112 30 by the commission.  Moneys collected from the state assessment
112 31 are to be credited to the assessment account.  The bill also
112 32 includes an expenditures account which only includes moneys
112 33 transferred from the general account and the assessment account
112 34 for purposes of financing methods to improve surface water
112 35 quality.  Moneys transferred from the assessment account are
113  1 to be used to reimburse the department of agriculture and land
113  2 stewardship or a commodity organization for reasonable costs
113  3 of conducting a referendum to determine if a state assessment
113  4 for clean water is to be established, continued, or terminated.
113  5 The commission can also apply to the executive council for
113  6 moneys required to pay for reasonable costs of conducting a
113  7 referendum.  Moneys deposited into the expenditures account
113  8 may also be used to pay refunds to producers who have paid the
113  9 state assessment if the refund application has been approved
113 10 by the commodity organization.  The commission must review
113 11 the balance of moneys in the general account and the balance
113 12 of moneys in the assessment account, prior to the end of
113 13 each fiscal year.  If the total amount of moneys expected
113 14 to be credited to the general account during the following
113 15 fiscal year will not at least equal the balance of moneys in
113 16 the assessment account the commission must order that each
113 17 commodity organization that is imposing and collecting a state
113 18 assessment immediately suspend the imposition of that state
113 19 assessment for the following fiscal year.
113 20    The bill appropriates $40 million from the general fund
113 21 of the state to the clean water commission for the fiscal
113 22 year beginning July 1, 2017, and ending June 30, 2018, to
113 23 be credited to the general account of the clean water fund.
113 24 However, the amount of the appropriation is to be reduced by
113 25 any moneys credited to the fund's assessment account due to
113 26 state assessments collected on or before June 30, 2017.
113 27    The commission, in cooperation with the department of
113 28 agriculture and land stewardship, the department of natural
113 29 resources, and the Iowa finance authority, must submit a
113 30 report to the governor and general assembly by January 15,
113 31 2018, which includes a description of current clean water
113 32 programs and projects and a detailed plan for consolidating all
113 33 water quality and soil conservation initiatives and programs
113 34 and associated projects administered by the department of
113 35 agriculture and land stewardship, the department of natural
114  1 resources, and the Iowa finance authority under the overall
114  2 supervision of the commission.

111  3    Sec. 132.  NAME CHANGE TO REFERENDUM FOR DIRECT USE.  Nothing
111  4 in this Act requires the department of agriculture and land
111  5 stewardship or a commodity organization described in section
111  6 466B.51, as enacted in this Act, to conduct a referendum
111  7 because of this Act's reference to a referendum as a referendum
111  8 for direct use.
111  9                           EXPLANATION
111 10 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
111 11 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
111 12    This bill relates to agricultural commodity organizations
111 13 representing producers of that commodity that are authorized
111 14 to impose an excise tax or "assessment" (and commonly
111 15 referred to as a "checkoff") on the commodity when first
111 16 sold by the producer to a first purchaser.  The goal of the
111 17 assessment is to fund promotional activities which involve
111 18 market development, research, and education.  The commodity
111 19 organizations include the Iowa dairy industry commission or
111 20 Iowa state dairy association (Code chapter 179), Iowa beef
111 21 cattle producers association (Code chapter 181), Iowa sheep and
111 22 wool promotion board (Code chapter 182), Iowa pork producers
111 23 council or Iowa pork producers association (Code chapter 183A),
111 24 Iowa egg council (Code chapter 184), the Iowa turkey marketing
111 25 council (Code chapter 184A), the Iowa soybean association
111 26 (Code chapter 185), and the Iowa corn promotion board (Code
111 27 chapter 185C).  The bill requires a commodity organization
111 28 to establish a separate state assessment for clean water, if
111 29 approved by a majority of its members at a referendum.  The
111 30 bill also requires commodity organizations to conduct a special
111 31 referendum to increase the rate of the assessment for clean
111 32 water. The rate of the state assessment is established by the
111 33 governing body of the commodity organization not to exceed the
111 34 assessment for direct use or national assessment or both. The
111 35 referendum would be conducted in the same manner as an initial
112  1 or special referendum conducted by the commodity organization
112  2 under its specific Code chapter.  The special assessment could
112  3 be continued or terminated in the same manner as the commodity
112  4 organization's assessment for promotional activities.  Moneys
112  5 from the state assessment would be collected by the commodity
112  6 organization and transferred to a newly created clean water
112  7 fund.
112  8    The bill establishes a clean water commission housed in
112  9 the division of soil conservation and water quality of the
112 10 department of agriculture and land stewardship.  The commission
112 11 is composed of nine voting members appointed by the governor,
112 12 four legislative members who serve in a nonvoting, ex officio
112 13 capacity, and persons appointed by the commodity organizations,
112 14 who also serve in a nonvoting, ex officio capacity.
112 15 Appointments are contingent on the commodity organization
112 16 having approved the establishment of a state assessment for
112 17 clean water to be transferred to the clean water fund. The
112 18 purpose of the commission is to finance methods to improve
112 19 surface water quality, including by reducing contributing
112 20 contaminant loads to receiving surface waters and reducing soil
112 21 erosion and sediment loss. The commission is responsible for
112 22 overseeing the water quality initiative as administered by the
112 23 division of soil conservation and water quality.
112 24    Moneys collected from the state assessment are to be
112 25 credited to the clean water fund which is under the supervision
112 26 of the commission.  The fund is composed of a general account,
112 27 an assessment account, and an expenditures account. The fund's
112 28 general account includes moneys appropriated by the general
112 29 assembly and other moneys available to and obtained or accepted
112 30 by the commission.  Moneys collected from the state assessment
112 31 are to be credited to the assessment account.  The bill also
112 32 includes an expenditures account which only includes moneys
112 33 transferred from the general account and the assessment account
112 34 for purposes of financing methods to improve surface water
112 35 quality.  Moneys transferred from the assessment account are
113  1 to be used to reimburse the department of agriculture and land
113  2 stewardship or a commodity organization for reasonable costs
113  3 of conducting a referendum to determine if a state assessment
113  4 for clean water is to be established, continued, or terminated.
113  5 The commission can also apply to the executive council for
113  6 moneys required to pay for reasonable costs of conducting a
113  7 referendum.  Moneys deposited into the expenditures account
113  8 may also be used to pay refunds to producers who have paid the
113  9 state assessment if the refund application has been approved
113 10 by the commodity organization.  The commission must review
113 11 the balance of moneys in the general account and the balance
113 12 of moneys in the assessment account, prior to the end of
113 13 each fiscal year.  If the total amount of moneys expected
113 14 to be credited to the general account during the following
113 15 fiscal year will not at least equal the balance of moneys in
113 16 the assessment account the commission must order that each
113 17 commodity organization that is imposing and collecting a state
113 18 assessment immediately suspend the imposition of that state
113 19 assessment for the following fiscal year.
113 20    The bill appropriates $40 million from the general fund
113 21 of the state to the clean water commission for the fiscal
113 22 year beginning July 1, 2017, and ending June 30, 2018, to
113 23 be credited to the general account of the clean water fund.
113 24 However, the amount of the appropriation is to be reduced by
113 25 any moneys credited to the fund's assessment account due to
113 26 state assessments collected on or before June 30, 2017.
113 27    The commission, in cooperation with the department of
113 28 agriculture and land stewardship, the department of natural
113 29 resources, and the Iowa finance authority, must submit a
113 30 report to the governor and general assembly by January 15,
113 31 2018, which includes a description of current clean water
113 32 programs and projects and a detailed plan for consolidating all
113 33 water quality and soil conservation initiatives and programs
113 34 and associated projects administered by the department of
113 35 agriculture and land stewardship, the department of natural
114  1 resources, and the Iowa finance authority under the overall
114  2 supervision of the commission.

112  8    The bill establishes a clean water commission housed in

112 23 division of soil conservation and water quality.
112 24    Moneys collected from the state assessment are to be
112 25 credited to the clean water fund which is under the supervision
112 26 of the commission.  The fund is composed of a general account,
112 27 an assessment account, and an expenditures account. The fund's
112 28 general account includes moneys appropriated by the general
112 29 assembly and other moneys available to and obtained or accepted
112 30 by the commission.  Moneys collected from the state assessment
112 31 are to be credited to the assessment account.  The bill also
112 32 includes an expenditures account which only includes moneys
112 33 transferred from the general account and the assessment account
112 34 for purposes of financing methods to improve surface water
112 35 quality.  Moneys transferred from the assessment account are
113  1 to be used to reimburse the department of agriculture and land
113  2 stewardship or a commodity organization for reasonable costs
113  3 of conducting a referendum to determine if a state assessment
113  4 for clean water is to be established, continued, or terminated.
113  5 The commission can also apply to the executive council for
113  6 moneys required to pay for reasonable costs of conducting a
113  7 referendum.  Moneys deposited into the expenditures account
113  8 may also be used to pay refunds to producers who have paid the
113  9 state assessment if the refund application has been approved
113 10 by the commodity organization.  The commission must review
113 11 the balance of moneys in the general account and the balance
113 12 of moneys in the assessment account, prior to the end of
113 13 each fiscal year.  If the total amount of moneys expected
113 14 to be credited to the general account during the following
113 15 fiscal year will not at least equal the balance of moneys in
113 16 the assessment account the commission must order that each
113 17 commodity organization that is imposing and collecting a state
113 18 assessment immediately suspend the imposition of that state
113 19 assessment for the following fiscal year.
113 20    The bill appropriates $40 million from the general fund
113 21 of the state to the clean water commission for the fiscal
113 22 year beginning July 1, 2017, and ending June 30, 2018, to
113 23 be credited to the general account of the clean water fund.
113 24 However, the amount of the appropriation is to be reduced by
113 25 any moneys credited to the fund's assessment account due to
113 26 state assessments collected on or before June 30, 2017.
113 27    The commission, in cooperation with the department of
113 28 agriculture and land stewardship, the department of natural
113 29 resources, and the Iowa finance authority, must submit a
113 30 report to the governor and general assembly by January 15,

111  4 in this Act requires the department of agriculture and land
111  5 stewardship or a commodity organization described in section
111  6 466B.51, as enacted in this Act, to conduct a referendum
111  7 because of this Act's reference to a referendum as a referendum
111  8 for direct use.
111  9                           EXPLANATION
111 10 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
111 11 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
111 12    This bill relates to agricultural commodity organizations
111 13 representing producers of that commodity that are authorized
111 14 to impose an excise tax or "assessment" (and commonly
111 15 referred to as a "checkoff") on the commodity when first
111 16 sold by the producer to a first purchaser.  The goal of the
111 17 assessment is to fund promotional activities which involve
111 18 market development, research, and education.  The commodity
111 19 organizations include the Iowa dairy industry commission or
111 20 Iowa state dairy association (Code chapter 179), Iowa beef
111 21 cattle producers association (Code chapter 181), Iowa sheep and
111 22 wool promotion board (Code chapter 182), Iowa pork producers
111 23 council or Iowa pork producers association (Code chapter 183A),
111 24 Iowa egg council (Code chapter 184), the Iowa turkey marketing
111 25 council (Code chapter 184A), the Iowa soybean association
111 26 (Code chapter 185), and the Iowa corn promotion board (Code
111 27 chapter 185C).  The bill requires a commodity organization
111 28 to establish a separate state assessment for clean water, if
111 29 approved by a majority of its members at a referendum.  The
111 30 bill also requires commodity organizations to conduct a special
111 31 referendum to increase the rate of the assessment for clean
111 32 water. The rate of the state assessment is established by the
111 33 governing body of the commodity organization not to exceed the
111 34 assessment for direct use or national assessment or both. The
111 35 referendum would be conducted in the same manner as an initial
112  1 or special referendum conducted by the commodity organization
112  2 under its specific Code chapter.  The special assessment could
112  3 be continued or terminated in the same manner as the commodity
112  4 organization's assessment for promotional activities.  Moneys
112  5 from the state assessment would be collected by the commodity
112  6 organization and transferred to a newly created clean water
112  7 fund.
112  8    The bill establishes a clean water commission housed in
112  9 the division of soil conservation and water quality of the
112 10 department of agriculture and land stewardship.  The commission
112 11 is composed of nine voting members appointed by the governor,
112 12 four legislative members who serve in a nonvoting, ex officio
112 13 capacity, and persons appointed by the commodity organizations,
112 14 who also serve in a nonvoting, ex officio capacity.
112 15 Appointments are contingent on the commodity organization
112 16 having approved the establishment of a state assessment for
112 17 clean water to be transferred to the clean water fund. The
112 18 purpose of the commission is to finance methods to improve
112 19 surface water quality, including by reducing contributing
112 20 contaminant loads to receiving surface waters and reducing soil
112 21 erosion and sediment loss. The commission is responsible for
112 22 overseeing the water quality initiative as administered by the
112 23 division of soil conservation and water quality.
112 24    Moneys collected from the state assessment are to be
112 25 credited to the clean water fund which is under the supervision
112 26 of the commission.  The fund is composed of a general account,
112 27 an assessment account, and an expenditures account. The fund's
112 28 general account includes moneys appropriated by the general
112 29 assembly and other moneys available to and obtained or accepted
112 30 by the commission.  Moneys collected from the state assessment
112 31 are to be credited to the assessment account.  The bill also
112 32 includes an expenditures account which only includes moneys
112 33 transferred from the general account and the assessment account
112 34 for purposes of financing methods to improve surface water
112 35 quality.  Moneys transferred from the assessment account are
113  1 to be used to reimburse the department of agriculture and land
113  2 stewardship or a commodity organization for reasonable costs
113  3 of conducting a referendum to determine if a state assessment
113  4 for clean water is to be established, continued, or terminated.
113  5 The commission can also apply to the executive council for
113  6 moneys required to pay for reasonable costs of conducting a
113  7 referendum.  Moneys deposited into the expenditures account
113  8 may also be used to pay refunds to producers who have paid the
113  9 state assessment if the refund application has been approved
113 10 by the commodity organization.  The commission must review
113 11 the balance of moneys in the general account and the balance
113 12 of moneys in the assessment account, prior to the end of
113 13 each fiscal year.  If the total amount of moneys expected
113 14 to be credited to the general account during the following
113 15 fiscal year will not at least equal the balance of moneys in
113 16 the assessment account the commission must order that each
113 17 commodity organization that is imposing and collecting a state
113 18 assessment immediately suspend the imposition of that state
113 19 assessment for the following fiscal year.
113 20    The bill appropriates $40 million from the general fund
113 21 of the state to the clean water commission for the fiscal
113 22 year beginning July 1, 2017, and ending June 30, 2018, to
113 23 be credited to the general account of the clean water fund.
113 24 However, the amount of the appropriation is to be reduced by
113 25 any moneys credited to the fund's assessment account due to
113 26 state assessments collected on or before June 30, 2017.
113 27    The commission, in cooperation with the department of
113 28 agriculture and land stewardship, the department of natural
113 29 resources, and the Iowa finance authority, must submit a
113 30 report to the governor and general assembly by January 15,
113 31 2018, which includes a description of current clean water
113 32 programs and projects and a detailed plan for consolidating all
113 33 water quality and soil conservation initiatives and programs
113 34 and associated projects administered by the department of
113 35 agriculture and land stewardship, the department of natural

112  5 from the state assessment would be collected by the commodity
112  6 organization and transferred to a newly created clean water
112  7 fund.
112  8    The bill establishes a clean water commission housed in

111  4 in this Act requires the department of agriculture and land
111  5 stewardship or a commodity organization described in section
111  6 466B.51, as enacted in this Act, to conduct a referendum
111  7 because of this Act's reference to a referendum as a referendum
111  8 for direct use.
111  9                           EXPLANATION
111 10 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
111 11 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
111 12    This bill relates to agricultural commodity organizations
111 13 representing producers of that commodity that are authorized
111 14 to impose an excise tax or "assessment" (and commonly
111 15 referred to as a "checkoff") on the commodity when first
111 16 sold by the producer to a first purchaser.  The goal of the
111 17 assessment is to fund promotional activities which involve
111 18 market development, research, and education.  The commodity
111 19 organizations include the Iowa dairy industry commission or
111 20 Iowa state dairy association (Code chapter 179), Iowa beef
111 21 cattle producers association (Code chapter 181), Iowa sheep and
111 22 wool promotion board (Code chapter 182), Iowa pork producers
111 23 council or Iowa pork producers association (Code chapter 183A),
111 24 Iowa egg council (Code chapter 184), the Iowa turkey marketing
111 25 council (Code chapter 184A), the Iowa soybean association
111 26 (Code chapter 185), and the Iowa corn promotion board (Code
111 27 chapter 185C).  The bill requires a commodity organization
111 28 to establish a separate state assessment for clean water, if
111 29 approved by a majority of its members at a referendum.  The
111 30 bill also requires commodity organizations to conduct a special
111 31 referendum to increase the rate of the assessment for clean
111 32 water. The rate of the state assessment is established by the
111 33 governing body of the commodity organization not to exceed the
111 34 assessment for direct use or national assessment or both. The
111 35 referendum would be conducted in the same manner as an initial
112  1 or special referendum conducted by the commodity organization
112  2 under its specific Code chapter.  The special assessment could
112  3 be continued or terminated in the same manner as the commodity
112  4 organization's assessment for promotional activities.  Moneys
112  5 from the state assessment would be collected by the commodity
112  6 organization and transferred to a newly created clean water
112  7 fund.
112  8    The bill establishes a clean water commission housed in
112  9 the division of soil conservation and water quality of the
112 10 department of agriculture and land stewardship.  The commission
112 11 is composed of nine voting members appointed by the governor,
112 12 four legislative members who serve in a nonvoting, ex officio
112 13 capacity, and persons appointed by the commodity organizations,
112 14 who also serve in a nonvoting, ex officio capacity.
112 15 Appointments are contingent on the commodity organization
112 16 having approved the establishment of a state assessment for
112 17 clean water to be transferred to the clean water fund. The
112 18 purpose of the commission is to finance methods to improve
112 19 surface water quality, including by reducing contributing
112 20 contaminant loads to receiving surface waters and reducing soil
112 21 erosion and sediment loss. The commission is responsible for
112 22 overseeing the water quality initiative as administered by the
112 23 division of soil conservation and water quality.
112 24    Moneys collected from the state assessment are to be
112 25 credited to the clean water fund which is under the supervision
112 26 of the commission.  The fund is composed of a general account,
112 27 an assessment account, and an expenditures account. The fund's
112 28 general account includes moneys appropriated by the general
112 29 assembly and other moneys available to and obtained or accepted
112 30 by the commission.  Moneys collected from the state assessment
112 31 are to be credited to the assessment account.  The bill also
112 32 includes an expenditures account which only includes moneys
112 33 transferred from the general account and the assessment account
112 34 for purposes of financing methods to improve surface water
112 35 quality.  Moneys transferred from the assessment account are
113  1 to be used to reimburse the department of agriculture and land
113  2 stewardship or a commodity organization for reasonable costs
113  3 of conducting a referendum to determine if a state assessment
113  4 for clean water is to be established, continued, or terminated.
113  5 The commission can also apply to the executive council for
113  6 moneys required to pay for reasonable costs of conducting a
113  7 referendum.  Moneys deposited into the expenditures account
113  8 may also be used to pay refunds to producers who have paid the
113  9 state assessment if the refund application has been approved
113 10 by the commodity organization.  The commission must review
113 11 the balance of moneys in the general account and the balance
113 12 of moneys in the assessment account, prior to the end of
113 13 each fiscal year.  If the total amount of moneys expected
113 14 to be credited to the general account during the following
113 15 fiscal year will not at least equal the balance of moneys in
113 16 the assessment account the commission must order that each
113 17 commodity organization that is imposing and collecting a state
113 18 assessment immediately suspend the imposition of that state
113 19 assessment for the following fiscal year.
113 20    The bill appropriates $40 million from the general fund
113 21 of the state to the clean water commission for the fiscal
113 22 year beginning July 1, 2017, and ending June 30, 2018, to
113 23 be credited to the general account of the clean water fund.
113 24 However, the amount of the appropriation is to be reduced by
113 25 any moneys credited to the fund's assessment account due to
113 26 state assessments collected on or before June 30, 2017.
113 27    The commission, in cooperation with the department of
113 28 agriculture and land stewardship, the department of natural
113 29 resources, and the Iowa finance authority, must submit a
113 30 report to the governor and general assembly by January 15,
113 31 2018, which includes a description of current clean water
113 32 programs and projects and a detailed plan for consolidating all
113 33 water quality and soil conservation initiatives and programs
113 34 and associated projects administered by the department of
113 35 agriculture and land stewardship, the department of natural
114  1 resources, and the Iowa finance authority under the overall
114  2 supervision of the commission.

110 21 to enact, amend, or repeal statutes and any administrative
110 22 proposals to adopt, revise, or rescind administrative rules.

112  8    The bill establishes a clean water commission housed in

111  4 in this Act requires the department of agriculture and land
111  5 stewardship or a commodity organization described in section
111  6 466B.51, as enacted in this Act, to conduct a referendum
111  7 because of this Act's reference to a referendum as a referendum
111  8 for direct use.
111  9                           EXPLANATION
111 10 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
111 11 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
111 12    This bill relates to agricultural commodity organizations
111 13 representing producers of that commodity that are authorized
111 14 to impose an excise tax or "assessment" (and commonly
111 15 referred to as a "checkoff") on the commodity when first
111 16 sold by the producer to a first purchaser.  The goal of the
111 17 assessment is to fund promotional activities which involve
111 18 market development, research, and education.  The commodity
111 19 organizations include the Iowa dairy industry commission or
111 20 Iowa state dairy association (Code chapter 179), Iowa beef
111 21 cattle producers association (Code chapter 181), Iowa sheep and
111 22 wool promotion board (Code chapter 182), Iowa pork producers
111 23 council or Iowa pork producers association (Code chapter 183A),
111 24 Iowa egg council (Code chapter 184), the Iowa turkey marketing
111 25 council (Code chapter 184A), the Iowa soybean association
111 26 (Code chapter 185), and the Iowa corn promotion board (Code
111 27 chapter 185C).  The bill requires a commodity organization
111 28 to establish a separate state assessment for clean water, if
111 29 approved by a majority of its members at a referendum.  The
111 30 bill also requires commodity organizations to conduct a special
111 31 referendum to increase the rate of the assessment for clean
111 32 water. The rate of the state assessment is established by the
111 33 governing body of the commodity organization not to exceed the
111 34 assessment for direct use or national assessment or both. The
111 35 referendum would be conducted in the same manner as an initial
112  1 or special referendum conducted by the commodity organization
112  2 under its specific Code chapter.  The special assessment could
112  3 be continued or terminated in the same manner as the commodity
112  4 organization's assessment for promotional activities.  Moneys
112  5 from the state assessment would be collected by the commodity
112  6 organization and transferred to a newly created clean water
112  7 fund.
112  8    The bill establishes a clean water commission housed in
112  9 the division of soil conservation and water quality of the
112 10 department of agriculture and land stewardship.  The commission
112 11 is composed of nine voting members appointed by the governor,
112 12 four legislative members who serve in a nonvoting, ex officio
112 13 capacity, and persons appointed by the commodity organizations,
112 14 who also serve in a nonvoting, ex officio capacity.
112 15 Appointments are contingent on the commodity organization
112 16 having approved the establishment of a state assessment for
112 17 clean water to be transferred to the clean water fund. The
112 18 purpose of the commission is to finance methods to improve
112 19 surface water quality, including by reducing contributing
112 20 contaminant loads to receiving surface waters and reducing soil
112 21 erosion and sediment loss. The commission is responsible for
112 22 overseeing the water quality initiative as administered by the
112 23 division of soil conservation and water quality.
112 24    Moneys collected from the state assessment are to be
112 25 credited to the clean water fund which is under the supervision
112 26 of the commission.  The fund is composed of a general account,
112 27 an assessment account, and an expenditures account. The fund's
112 28 general account includes moneys appropriated by the general
112 29 assembly and other moneys available to and obtained or accepted
112 30 by the commission.  Moneys collected from the state assessment
112 31 are to be credited to the assessment account.  The bill also
112 32 includes an expenditures account which only includes moneys
112 33 transferred from the general account and the assessment account
112 34 for purposes of financing methods to improve surface water
112 35 quality.  Moneys transferred from the assessment account are
113  1 to be used to reimburse the department of agriculture and land
113  2 stewardship or a commodity organization for reasonable costs
113  3 of conducting a referendum to determine if a state assessment
113  4 for clean water is to be established, continued, or terminated.
113  5 The commission can also apply to the executive council for
113  6 moneys required to pay for reasonable costs of conducting a
113  7 referendum.  Moneys deposited into the expenditures account
113  8 may also be used to pay refunds to producers who have paid the
113  9 state assessment if the refund application has been approved
113 10 by the commodity organization.  The commission must review
113 11 the balance of moneys in the general account and the balance
113 12 of moneys in the assessment account, prior to the end of
113 13 each fiscal year.  If the total amount of moneys expected
113 14 to be credited to the general account during the following
113 15 fiscal year will not at least equal the balance of moneys in
113 16 the assessment account the commission must order that each
113 17 commodity organization that is imposing and collecting a state
113 18 assessment immediately suspend the imposition of that state
113 19 assessment for the following fiscal year.
113 20    The bill appropriates $40 million from the general fund
113 21 of the state to the clean water commission for the fiscal
113 22 year beginning July 1, 2017, and ending June 30, 2018, to

112  7 fund.
112  8    The bill establishes a clean water commission housed in
112  9 the division of soil conservation and water quality of the
112 10 department of agriculture and land stewardship.  The commission
112 11 is composed of nine voting members appointed by the governor,
112 12 four legislative members who serve in a nonvoting, ex officio
112 13 capacity, and persons appointed by the commodity organizations,
112 14 who also serve in a nonvoting, ex officio capacity.
112 15 Appointments are contingent on the commodity organization
112 16 having approved the establishment of a state assessment for
112 17 clean water to be transferred to the clean water fund. The
112 18 purpose of the commission is to finance methods to improve
112 19 surface water quality, including by reducing contributing
112 20 contaminant loads to receiving surface waters and reducing soil
112 21 erosion and sediment loss. The commission is responsible for
112 22 overseeing the water quality initiative as administered by the
112 23 division of soil conservation and water quality.
112 24    Moneys collected from the state assessment are to be
112 25 credited to the clean water fund which is under the supervision
112 26 of the commission.  The fund is composed of a general account,
112 27 an assessment account, and an expenditures account. The fund's
112 28 general account includes moneys appropriated by the general
112 29 assembly and other moneys available to and obtained or accepted
112 30 by the commission.  Moneys collected from the state assessment
112 31 are to be credited to the assessment account.  The bill also
112 32 includes an expenditures account which only includes moneys
112 33 transferred from the general account and the assessment account
112 34 for purposes of financing methods to improve surface water
112 35 quality.  Moneys transferred from the assessment account are
113  1 to be used to reimburse the department of agriculture and land
113  2 stewardship or a commodity organization for reasonable costs
113  3 of conducting a referendum to determine if a state assessment
113  4 for clean water is to be established, continued, or terminated.
113  5 The commission can also apply to the executive council for
113  6 moneys required to pay for reasonable costs of conducting a
113  7 referendum.  Moneys deposited into the expenditures account
113  8 may also be used to pay refunds to producers who have paid the
113  9 state assessment if the refund application has been approved
113 10 by the commodity organization.  The commission must review
113 11 the balance of moneys in the general account and the balance
113 12 of moneys in the assessment account, prior to the end of
113 13 each fiscal year.  If the total amount of moneys expected
113 14 to be credited to the general account during the following
113 15 fiscal year will not at least equal the balance of moneys in
113 16 the assessment account the commission must order that each
113 17 commodity organization that is imposing and collecting a state
113 18 assessment immediately suspend the imposition of that state
113 19 assessment for the following fiscal year.
113 20    The bill appropriates $40 million from the general fund
113 21 of the state to the clean water commission for the fiscal
113 22 year beginning July 1, 2017, and ending June 30, 2018, to
113 23 be credited to the general account of the clean water fund.
113 24 However, the amount of the appropriation is to be reduced by
113 25 any moneys credited to the fund's assessment account due to
113 26 state assessments collected on or before June 30, 2017.
113 27    The commission, in cooperation with the department of
113 28 agriculture and land stewardship, the department of natural
113 29 resources, and the Iowa finance authority, must submit a
113 30 report to the governor and general assembly by January 15,

111  6 466B.51, as enacted in this Act, to conduct a referendum
111  7 because of this Act's reference to a referendum as a referendum
111  8 for direct use.
111  9                           EXPLANATION
111 10 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
111 11 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
111 12    This bill relates to agricultural commodity organizations
111 13 representing producers of that commodity that are authorized
111 14 to impose an excise tax or "assessment" (and commonly
111 15 referred to as a "checkoff") on the commodity when first
111 16 sold by the producer to a first purchaser.  The goal of the
111 17 assessment is to fund promotional activities which involve
111 18 market development, research, and education.  The commodity
111 19 organizations include the Iowa dairy industry commission or
111 20 Iowa state dairy association (Code chapter 179), Iowa beef
111 21 cattle producers association (Code chapter 181), Iowa sheep and
111 22 wool promotion board (Code chapter 182), Iowa pork producers
111 23 council or Iowa pork producers association (Code chapter 183A),
111 24 Iowa egg council (Code chapter 184), the Iowa turkey marketing
111 25 council (Code chapter 184A), the Iowa soybean association
111 26 (Code chapter 185), and the Iowa corn promotion board (Code
111 27 chapter 185C).  The bill requires a commodity organization
111 28 to establish a separate state assessment for clean water, if
111 29 approved by a majority of its members at a referendum.  The
111 30 bill also requires commodity organizations to conduct a special
111 31 referendum to increase the rate of the assessment for clean
111 32 water. The rate of the state assessment is established by the
111 33 governing body of the commodity organization not to exceed the
111 34 assessment for direct use or national assessment or both. The
111 35 referendum would be conducted in the same manner as an initial
112  1 or special referendum conducted by the commodity organization
112  2 under its specific Code chapter.  The special assessment could
112  3 be continued or terminated in the same manner as the commodity
112  4 organization's assessment for promotional activities.  Moneys
112  5 from the state assessment would be collected by the commodity
112  6 organization and transferred to a newly created clean water
112  7 fund.
112  8    The bill establishes a clean water commission housed in
112  9 the division of soil conservation and water quality of the

111  5 stewardship or a commodity organization described in section
111  6 466B.51, as enacted in this Act, to conduct a referendum
111  7 because of this Act's reference to a referendum as a referendum
111  8 for direct use.
111  9                           EXPLANATION
111 10 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
111 11 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
111 12    This bill relates to agricultural commodity organizations
111 13 representing producers of that commodity that are authorized
111 14 to impose an excise tax or "assessment" (and commonly
111 15 referred to as a "checkoff") on the commodity when first
111 16 sold by the producer to a first purchaser.  The goal of the
111 17 assessment is to fund promotional activities which involve
111 18 market development, research, and education.  The commodity
111 19 organizations include the Iowa dairy industry commission or
111 20 Iowa state dairy association (Code chapter 179), Iowa beef
111 21 cattle producers association (Code chapter 181), Iowa sheep and
111 22 wool promotion board (Code chapter 182), Iowa pork producers
111 23 council or Iowa pork producers association (Code chapter 183A),
111 24 Iowa egg council (Code chapter 184), the Iowa turkey marketing
111 25 council (Code chapter 184A), the Iowa soybean association
111 26 (Code chapter 185), and the Iowa corn promotion board (Code
111 27 chapter 185C).  The bill requires a commodity organization
111 28 to establish a separate state assessment for clean water, if
111 29 approved by a majority of its members at a referendum.  The
111 30 bill also requires commodity organizations to conduct a special
111 31 referendum to increase the rate of the assessment for clean
111 32 water. The rate of the state assessment is established by the
111 33 governing body of the commodity organization not to exceed the
111 34 assessment for direct use or national assessment or both. The
111 35 referendum would be conducted in the same manner as an initial
112  1 or special referendum conducted by the commodity organization
112  2 under its specific Code chapter.  The special assessment could
112  3 be continued or terminated in the same manner as the commodity
112  4 organization's assessment for promotional activities.  Moneys
112  5 from the state assessment would be collected by the commodity
112  6 organization and transferred to a newly created clean water
112  7 fund.
112  8    The bill establishes a clean water commission housed in
112  9 the division of soil conservation and water quality of the
112 10 department of agriculture and land stewardship.  The commission
112 11 is composed of nine voting members appointed by the governor,
112 12 four legislative members who serve in a nonvoting, ex officio
112 13 capacity, and persons appointed by the commodity organizations,
112 14 who also serve in a nonvoting, ex officio capacity.
112 15 Appointments are contingent on the commodity organization
112 16 having approved the establishment of a state assessment for
112 17 clean water to be transferred to the clean water fund. The
112 18 purpose of the commission is to finance methods to improve
112 19 surface water quality, including by reducing contributing
112 20 contaminant loads to receiving surface waters and reducing soil
112 21 erosion and sediment loss. The commission is responsible for
112 22 overseeing the water quality initiative as administered by the
112 23 division of soil conservation and water quality.
112 24    Moneys collected from the state assessment are to be
112 25 credited to the clean water fund which is under the supervision
112 26 of the commission.  The fund is composed of a general account,
112 27 an assessment account, and an expenditures account. The fund's
112 28 general account includes moneys appropriated by the general
112 29 assembly and other moneys available to and obtained or accepted
112 30 by the commission.  Moneys collected from the state assessment
112 31 are to be credited to the assessment account.  The bill also
112 32 includes an expenditures account which only includes moneys
112 33 transferred from the general account and the assessment account
112 34 for purposes of financing methods to improve surface water
112 35 quality.  Moneys transferred from the assessment account are
113  1 to be used to reimburse the department of agriculture and land
113  2 stewardship or a commodity organization for reasonable costs
113  3 of conducting a referendum to determine if a state assessment
113  4 for clean water is to be established, continued, or terminated.
113  5 The commission can also apply to the executive council for
113  6 moneys required to pay for reasonable costs of conducting a
113  7 referendum.  Moneys deposited into the expenditures account
113  8 may also be used to pay refunds to producers who have paid the
113  9 state assessment if the refund application has been approved
113 10 by the commodity organization.  The commission must review
113 11 the balance of moneys in the general account and the balance
113 12 of moneys in the assessment account, prior to the end of
113 13 each fiscal year.  If the total amount of moneys expected
113 14 to be credited to the general account during the following
113 15 fiscal year will not at least equal the balance of moneys in
113 16 the assessment account the commission must order that each
113 17 commodity organization that is imposing and collecting a state
113 18 assessment immediately suspend the imposition of that state
113 19 assessment for the following fiscal year.
113 20    The bill appropriates $40 million from the general fund
113 21 of the state to the clean water commission for the fiscal
113 22 year beginning July 1, 2017, and ending June 30, 2018, to
113 23 be credited to the general account of the clean water fund.
113 24 However, the amount of the appropriation is to be reduced by
113 25 any moneys credited to the fund's assessment account due to
113 26 state assessments collected on or before June 30, 2017.
113 27    The commission, in cooperation with the department of
113 28 agriculture and land stewardship, the department of natural
113 29 resources, and the Iowa finance authority, must submit a
113 30 report to the governor and general assembly by January 15,
113 31 2018, which includes a description of current clean water
113 32 programs and projects and a detailed plan for consolidating all
113 33 water quality and soil conservation initiatives and programs
113 34 and associated projects administered by the department of
113 35 agriculture and land stewardship, the department of natural
114  1 resources, and the Iowa finance authority under the overall

111  3    Sec. 132.  NAME CHANGE TO REFERENDUM FOR DIRECT USE.  Nothing
111  4 in this Act requires the department of agriculture and land
111  5 stewardship or a commodity organization described in section
111  6 466B.51, as enacted in this Act, to conduct a referendum
111  7 because of this Act's reference to a referendum as a referendum
111  8 for direct use.
111  9                           EXPLANATION
111 10 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
111 11 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
111 12    This bill relates to agricultural commodity organizations
111 13 representing producers of that commodity that are authorized
111 14 to impose an excise tax or "assessment" (and commonly
111 15 referred to as a "checkoff") on the commodity when first
111 16 sold by the producer to a first purchaser.  The goal of the
111 17 assessment is to fund promotional activities which involve
111 18 market development, research, and education.  The commodity
111 19 organizations include the Iowa dairy industry commission or
111 20 Iowa state dairy association (Code chapter 179), Iowa beef
111 21 cattle producers association (Code chapter 181), Iowa sheep and
111 22 wool promotion board (Code chapter 182), Iowa pork producers
111 23 council or Iowa pork producers association (Code chapter 183A),
111 24 Iowa egg council (Code chapter 184), the Iowa turkey marketing
111 25 council (Code chapter 184A), the Iowa soybean association
111 26 (Code chapter 185), and the Iowa corn promotion board (Code
111 27 chapter 185C).  The bill requires a commodity organization
111 28 to establish a separate state assessment for clean water, if
111 29 approved by a majority of its members at a referendum.  The
111 30 bill also requires commodity organizations to conduct a special
111 31 referendum to increase the rate of the assessment for clean
111 32 water. The rate of the state assessment is established by the
111 33 governing body of the commodity organization not to exceed the
111 34 assessment for direct use or national assessment or both. The
111 35 referendum would be conducted in the same manner as an initial
112  1 or special referendum conducted by the commodity organization
112  2 under its specific Code chapter.  The special assessment could
112  3 be continued or terminated in the same manner as the commodity
112  4 organization's assessment for promotional activities.  Moneys
112  5 from the state assessment would be collected by the commodity
112  6 organization and transferred to a newly created clean water
112  7 fund.
112  8    The bill establishes a clean water commission housed in
112  9 the division of soil conservation and water quality of the
112 10 department of agriculture and land stewardship.  The commission
112 11 is composed of nine voting members appointed by the governor,
112 12 four legislative members who serve in a nonvoting, ex officio
112 13 capacity, and persons appointed by the commodity organizations,
112 14 who also serve in a nonvoting, ex officio capacity.
112 15 Appointments are contingent on the commodity organization
112 16 having approved the establishment of a state assessment for
112 17 clean water to be transferred to the clean water fund. The
112 18 purpose of the commission is to finance methods to improve
112 19 surface water quality, including by reducing contributing
112 20 contaminant loads to receiving surface waters and reducing soil
112 21 erosion and sediment loss. The commission is responsible for
112 22 overseeing the water quality initiative as administered by the
112 23 division of soil conservation and water quality.
112 24    Moneys collected from the state assessment are to be
112 25 credited to the clean water fund which is under the supervision
112 26 of the commission.  The fund is composed of a general account,
112 27 an assessment account, and an expenditures account. The fund's
112 28 general account includes moneys appropriated by the general
112 29 assembly and other moneys available to and obtained or accepted
112 30 by the commission.  Moneys collected from the state assessment
112 31 are to be credited to the assessment account.  The bill also
112 32 includes an expenditures account which only includes moneys
112 33 transferred from the general account and the assessment account
112 34 for purposes of financing methods to improve surface water
112 35 quality.  Moneys transferred from the assessment account are
113  1 to be used to reimburse the department of agriculture and land
113  2 stewardship or a commodity organization for reasonable costs
113  3 of conducting a referendum to determine if a state assessment
113  4 for clean water is to be established, continued, or terminated.
113  5 The commission can also apply to the executive council for
113  6 moneys required to pay for reasonable costs of conducting a
113  7 referendum.  Moneys deposited into the expenditures account
113  8 may also be used to pay refunds to producers who have paid the
113  9 state assessment if the refund application has been approved
113 10 by the commodity organization.  The commission must review
113 11 the balance of moneys in the general account and the balance
113 12 of moneys in the assessment account, prior to the end of
113 13 each fiscal year.  If the total amount of moneys expected
113 14 to be credited to the general account during the following
113 15 fiscal year will not at least equal the balance of moneys in
113 16 the assessment account the commission must order that each
113 17 commodity organization that is imposing and collecting a state
113 18 assessment immediately suspend the imposition of that state
113 19 assessment for the following fiscal year.
113 20    The bill appropriates $40 million from the general fund
113 21 of the state to the clean water commission for the fiscal
113 22 year beginning July 1, 2017, and ending June 30, 2018, to
113 23 be credited to the general account of the clean water fund.
113 24 However, the amount of the appropriation is to be reduced by
113 25 any moneys credited to the fund's assessment account due to
113 26 state assessments collected on or before June 30, 2017.
113 27    The commission, in cooperation with the department of
113 28 agriculture and land stewardship, the department of natural
113 29 resources, and the Iowa finance authority, must submit a
113 30 report to the governor and general assembly by January 15,
113 31 2018, which includes a description of current clean water
113 32 programs and projects and a detailed plan for consolidating all
113 33 water quality and soil conservation initiatives and programs
113 34 and associated projects administered by the department of
113 35 agriculture and land stewardship, the department of natural
114  1 resources, and the Iowa finance authority under the overall
114  2 supervision of the commission.

110 12 additional funding from private and public sources including

110 15 include a detailed plan for consolidating all water quality
110 16 and soil conservation initiatives and programs and associated
110 17 projects administered by the department of agriculture and
110 18 land stewardship, the department of natural resources, and the
110 19 Iowa finance authority under the overall supervision of the

111  4 in this Act requires the department of agriculture and land
111  5 stewardship or a commodity organization described in section
111  6 466B.51, as enacted in this Act, to conduct a referendum
111  7 because of this Act's reference to a referendum as a referendum
111  8 for direct use.
111  9                           EXPLANATION
111 10 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
111 11 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
111 12    This bill relates to agricultural commodity organizations
111 13 representing producers of that commodity that are authorized
111 14 to impose an excise tax or "assessment" (and commonly
111 15 referred to as a "checkoff") on the commodity when first
111 16 sold by the producer to a first purchaser.  The goal of the
111 17 assessment is to fund promotional activities which involve
111 18 market development, research, and education.  The commodity
111 19 organizations include the Iowa dairy industry commission or
111 20 Iowa state dairy association (Code chapter 179), Iowa beef
111 21 cattle producers association (Code chapter 181), Iowa sheep and
111 22 wool promotion board (Code chapter 182), Iowa pork producers
111 23 council or Iowa pork producers association (Code chapter 183A),
111 24 Iowa egg council (Code chapter 184), the Iowa turkey marketing
111 25 council (Code chapter 184A), the Iowa soybean association
111 26 (Code chapter 185), and the Iowa corn promotion board (Code
111 27 chapter 185C).  The bill requires a commodity organization
111 28 to establish a separate state assessment for clean water, if
111 29 approved by a majority of its members at a referendum.  The
111 30 bill also requires commodity organizations to conduct a special
111 31 referendum to increase the rate of the assessment for clean
111 32 water. The rate of the state assessment is established by the
111 33 governing body of the commodity organization not to exceed the
111 34 assessment for direct use or national assessment or both. The
111 35 referendum would be conducted in the same manner as an initial
112  1 or special referendum conducted by the commodity organization
112  2 under its specific Code chapter.  The special assessment could
112  3 be continued or terminated in the same manner as the commodity
112  4 organization's assessment for promotional activities.  Moneys
112  5 from the state assessment would be collected by the commodity
112  6 organization and transferred to a newly created clean water
112  7 fund.
112  8    The bill establishes a clean water commission housed in
112  9 the division of soil conservation and water quality of the
112 10 department of agriculture and land stewardship.  The commission
112 11 is composed of nine voting members appointed by the governor,
112 12 four legislative members who serve in a nonvoting, ex officio
112 13 capacity, and persons appointed by the commodity organizations,
112 14 who also serve in a nonvoting, ex officio capacity.
112 15 Appointments are contingent on the commodity organization
112 16 having approved the establishment of a state assessment for
112 17 clean water to be transferred to the clean water fund. The
112 18 purpose of the commission is to finance methods to improve
112 19 surface water quality, including by reducing contributing
112 20 contaminant loads to receiving surface waters and reducing soil
112 21 erosion and sediment loss. The commission is responsible for
112 22 overseeing the water quality initiative as administered by the
112 23 division of soil conservation and water quality.
112 24    Moneys collected from the state assessment are to be
112 25 credited to the clean water fund which is under the supervision
112 26 of the commission.  The fund is composed of a general account,
112 27 an assessment account, and an expenditures account. The fund's
112 28 general account includes moneys appropriated by the general
112 29 assembly and other moneys available to and obtained or accepted
112 30 by the commission.  Moneys collected from the state assessment
112 31 are to be credited to the assessment account.  The bill also
112 32 includes an expenditures account which only includes moneys
112 33 transferred from the general account and the assessment account
112 34 for purposes of financing methods to improve surface water
112 35 quality.  Moneys transferred from the assessment account are
113  1 to be used to reimburse the department of agriculture and land
113  2 stewardship or a commodity organization for reasonable costs
113  3 of conducting a referendum to determine if a state assessment
113  4 for clean water is to be established, continued, or terminated.
113  5 The commission can also apply to the executive council for
113  6 moneys required to pay for reasonable costs of conducting a
113  7 referendum.  Moneys deposited into the expenditures account
113  8 may also be used to pay refunds to producers who have paid the
113  9 state assessment if the refund application has been approved
113 10 by the commodity organization.  The commission must review
113 11 the balance of moneys in the general account and the balance
113 12 of moneys in the assessment account, prior to the end of
113 13 each fiscal year.  If the total amount of moneys expected
113 14 to be credited to the general account during the following
113 15 fiscal year will not at least equal the balance of moneys in
113 16 the assessment account the commission must order that each
113 17 commodity organization that is imposing and collecting a state
113 18 assessment immediately suspend the imposition of that state
113 19 assessment for the following fiscal year.
113 20    The bill appropriates $40 million from the general fund
113 21 of the state to the clean water commission for the fiscal
113 22 year beginning July 1, 2017, and ending June 30, 2018, to
113 23 be credited to the general account of the clean water fund.
113 24 However, the amount of the appropriation is to be reduced by

113  7 referendum.  Moneys deposited into the expenditures account
113  8 may also be used to pay refunds to producers who have paid the
113  9 state assessment if the refund application has been approved
113 10 by the commodity organization.  The commission must review
113 11 the balance of moneys in the general account and the balance
113 12 of moneys in the assessment account, prior to the end of
113 13 each fiscal year.  If the total amount of moneys expected
113 14 to be credited to the general account during the following
113 15 fiscal year will not at least equal the balance of moneys in
113 16 the assessment account the commission must order that each
113 17 commodity organization that is imposing and collecting a state
113 18 assessment immediately suspend the imposition of that state
113 19 assessment for the following fiscal year.
113 20    The bill appropriates $40 million from the general fund
113 21 of the state to the clean water commission for the fiscal
113 22 year beginning July 1, 2017, and ending June 30, 2018, to
113 23 be credited to the general account of the clean water fund.
113 24 However, the amount of the appropriation is to be reduced by
113 25 any moneys credited to the fund's assessment account due to
113 26 state assessments collected on or before June 30, 2017.
113 27    The commission, in cooperation with the department of

111  4 in this Act requires the department of agriculture and land
111  5 stewardship or a commodity organization described in section
111  6 466B.51, as enacted in this Act, to conduct a referendum
111  7 because of this Act's reference to a referendum as a referendum
111  8 for direct use.
111  9                           EXPLANATION
111 10 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
111 11 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
111 12    This bill relates to agricultural commodity organizations
111 13 representing producers of that commodity that are authorized
111 14 to impose an excise tax or "assessment" (and commonly
111 15 referred to as a "checkoff") on the commodity when first
111 16 sold by the producer to a first purchaser.  The goal of the
111 17 assessment is to fund promotional activities which involve
111 18 market development, research, and education.  The commodity
111 19 organizations include the Iowa dairy industry commission or
111 20 Iowa state dairy association (Code chapter 179), Iowa beef
111 21 cattle producers association (Code chapter 181), Iowa sheep and
111 22 wool promotion board (Code chapter 182), Iowa pork producers
111 23 council or Iowa pork producers association (Code chapter 183A),
111 24 Iowa egg council (Code chapter 184), the Iowa turkey marketing
111 25 council (Code chapter 184A), the Iowa soybean association
111 26 (Code chapter 185), and the Iowa corn promotion board (Code
111 27 chapter 185C).  The bill requires a commodity organization
111 28 to establish a separate state assessment for clean water, if
111 29 approved by a majority of its members at a referendum.  The
111 30 bill also requires commodity organizations to conduct a special
111 31 referendum to increase the rate of the assessment for clean
111 32 water. The rate of the state assessment is established by the
111 33 governing body of the commodity organization not to exceed the
111 34 assessment for direct use or national assessment or both. The
111 35 referendum would be conducted in the same manner as an initial
112  1 or special referendum conducted by the commodity organization
112  2 under its specific Code chapter.  The special assessment could
112  3 be continued or terminated in the same manner as the commodity
112  4 organization's assessment for promotional activities.  Moneys
112  5 from the state assessment would be collected by the commodity
112  6 organization and transferred to a newly created clean water
112  7 fund.
112  8    The bill establishes a clean water commission housed in
112  9 the division of soil conservation and water quality of the
112 10 department of agriculture and land stewardship.  The commission
112 11 is composed of nine voting members appointed by the governor,
112 12 four legislative members who serve in a nonvoting, ex officio
112 13 capacity, and persons appointed by the commodity organizations,
112 14 who also serve in a nonvoting, ex officio capacity.
112 15 Appointments are contingent on the commodity organization
112 16 having approved the establishment of a state assessment for
112 17 clean water to be transferred to the clean water fund. The
112 18 purpose of the commission is to finance methods to improve
112 19 surface water quality, including by reducing contributing
112 20 contaminant loads to receiving surface waters and reducing soil
112 21 erosion and sediment loss. The commission is responsible for
112 22 overseeing the water quality initiative as administered by the
112 23 division of soil conservation and water quality.
112 24    Moneys collected from the state assessment are to be
112 25 credited to the clean water fund which is under the supervision
112 26 of the commission.  The fund is composed of a general account,
112 27 an assessment account, and an expenditures account. The fund's
112 28 general account includes moneys appropriated by the general
112 29 assembly and other moneys available to and obtained or accepted
112 30 by the commission.  Moneys collected from the state assessment
112 31 are to be credited to the assessment account.  The bill also
112 32 includes an expenditures account which only includes moneys
112 33 transferred from the general account and the assessment account
112 34 for purposes of financing methods to improve surface water
112 35 quality.  Moneys transferred from the assessment account are
113  1 to be used to reimburse the department of agriculture and land
113  2 stewardship or a commodity organization for reasonable costs
113  3 of conducting a referendum to determine if a state assessment
113  4 for clean water is to be established, continued, or terminated.
113  5 The commission can also apply to the executive council for
113  6 moneys required to pay for reasonable costs of conducting a
113  7 referendum.  Moneys deposited into the expenditures account
113  8 may also be used to pay refunds to producers who have paid the
113  9 state assessment if the refund application has been approved
113 10 by the commodity organization.  The commission must review
113 11 the balance of moneys in the general account and the balance
113 12 of moneys in the assessment account, prior to the end of
113 13 each fiscal year.  If the total amount of moneys expected
113 14 to be credited to the general account during the following
113 15 fiscal year will not at least equal the balance of moneys in
113 16 the assessment account the commission must order that each
113 17 commodity organization that is imposing and collecting a state
113 18 assessment immediately suspend the imposition of that state
113 19 assessment for the following fiscal year.
113 20    The bill appropriates $40 million from the general fund
113 21 of the state to the clean water commission for the fiscal
113 22 year beginning July 1, 2017, and ending June 30, 2018, to

112 35 quality.  Moneys transferred from the assessment account are
113  1 to be used to reimburse the department of agriculture and land
113  2 stewardship or a commodity organization for reasonable costs
113  3 of conducting a referendum to determine if a state assessment
113  4 for clean water is to be established, continued, or terminated.
113  5 The commission can also apply to the executive council for
113  6 moneys required to pay for reasonable costs of conducting a
113  7 referendum.  Moneys deposited into the expenditures account
113  8 may also be used to pay refunds to producers who have paid the
113  9 state assessment if the refund application has been approved
113 10 by the commodity organization.  The commission must review
113 11 the balance of moneys in the general account and the balance
113 12 of moneys in the assessment account, prior to the end of
113 13 each fiscal year.  If the total amount of moneys expected
113 14 to be credited to the general account during the following
113 15 fiscal year will not at least equal the balance of moneys in
113 16 the assessment account the commission must order that each
113 17 commodity organization that is imposing and collecting a state
113 18 assessment immediately suspend the imposition of that state
113 19 assessment for the following fiscal year.
113 20    The bill appropriates $40 million from the general fund
113 21 of the state to the clean water commission for the fiscal
113 22 year beginning July 1, 2017, and ending June 30, 2018, to
113 23 be credited to the general account of the clean water fund.
113 24 However, the amount of the appropriation is to be reduced by
113 25 any moneys credited to the fund's assessment account due to
113 26 state assessments collected on or before June 30, 2017.
113 27    The commission, in cooperation with the department of
113 28 agriculture and land stewardship, the department of natural
113 29 resources, and the Iowa finance authority, must submit a
113 30 report to the governor and general assembly by January 15,

111  4 in this Act requires the department of agriculture and land
111  5 stewardship or a commodity organization described in section
111  6 466B.51, as enacted in this Act, to conduct a referendum
111  7 because of this Act's reference to a referendum as a referendum
111  8 for direct use.
111  9                           EXPLANATION
111 10 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
111 11 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
111 12    This bill relates to agricultural commodity organizations
111 13 representing producers of that commodity that are authorized
111 14 to impose an excise tax or "assessment" (and commonly
111 15 referred to as a "checkoff") on the commodity when first
111 16 sold by the producer to a first purchaser.  The goal of the
111 17 assessment is to fund promotional activities which involve
111 18 market development, research, and education.  The commodity
111 19 organizations include the Iowa dairy industry commission or
111 20 Iowa state dairy association (Code chapter 179), Iowa beef
111 21 cattle producers association (Code chapter 181), Iowa sheep and
111 22 wool promotion board (Code chapter 182), Iowa pork producers
111 23 council or Iowa pork producers association (Code chapter 183A),
111 24 Iowa egg council (Code chapter 184), the Iowa turkey marketing
111 25 council (Code chapter 184A), the Iowa soybean association
111 26 (Code chapter 185), and the Iowa corn promotion board (Code
111 27 chapter 185C).  The bill requires a commodity organization
111 28 to establish a separate state assessment for clean water, if
111 29 approved by a majority of its members at a referendum.  The
111 30 bill also requires commodity organizations to conduct a special
111 31 referendum to increase the rate of the assessment for clean
111 32 water. The rate of the state assessment is established by the
111 33 governing body of the commodity organization not to exceed the
111 34 assessment for direct use or national assessment or both. The
111 35 referendum would be conducted in the same manner as an initial
112  1 or special referendum conducted by the commodity organization
112  2 under its specific Code chapter.  The special assessment could
112  3 be continued or terminated in the same manner as the commodity
112  4 organization's assessment for promotional activities.  Moneys
112  5 from the state assessment would be collected by the commodity
112  6 organization and transferred to a newly created clean water
112  7 fund.
112  8    The bill establishes a clean water commission housed in
112  9 the division of soil conservation and water quality of the
112 10 department of agriculture and land stewardship.  The commission
112 11 is composed of nine voting members appointed by the governor,
112 12 four legislative members who serve in a nonvoting, ex officio
112 13 capacity, and persons appointed by the commodity organizations,
112 14 who also serve in a nonvoting, ex officio capacity.
112 15 Appointments are contingent on the commodity organization
112 16 having approved the establishment of a state assessment for
112 17 clean water to be transferred to the clean water fund. The
112 18 purpose of the commission is to finance methods to improve
112 19 surface water quality, including by reducing contributing
112 20 contaminant loads to receiving surface waters and reducing soil
112 21 erosion and sediment loss. The commission is responsible for
112 22 overseeing the water quality initiative as administered by the
112 23 division of soil conservation and water quality.
112 24    Moneys collected from the state assessment are to be
112 25 credited to the clean water fund which is under the supervision
112 26 of the commission.  The fund is composed of a general account,
112 27 an assessment account, and an expenditures account. The fund's
112 28 general account includes moneys appropriated by the general
112 29 assembly and other moneys available to and obtained or accepted
112 30 by the commission.  Moneys collected from the state assessment
112 31 are to be credited to the assessment account.  The bill also
112 32 includes an expenditures account which only includes moneys
112 33 transferred from the general account and the assessment account
112 34 for purposes of financing methods to improve surface water
112 35 quality.  Moneys transferred from the assessment account are
113  1 to be used to reimburse the department of agriculture and land
113  2 stewardship or a commodity organization for reasonable costs
113  3 of conducting a referendum to determine if a state assessment
113  4 for clean water is to be established, continued, or terminated.
113  5 The commission can also apply to the executive council for
113  6 moneys required to pay for reasonable costs of conducting a
113  7 referendum.  Moneys deposited into the expenditures account
113  8 may also be used to pay refunds to producers who have paid the
113  9 state assessment if the refund application has been approved
113 10 by the commodity organization.  The commission must review
113 11 the balance of moneys in the general account and the balance
113 12 of moneys in the assessment account, prior to the end of
113 13 each fiscal year.  If the total amount of moneys expected
113 14 to be credited to the general account during the following
113 15 fiscal year will not at least equal the balance of moneys in
113 16 the assessment account the commission must order that each
113 17 commodity organization that is imposing and collecting a state
113 18 assessment immediately suspend the imposition of that state
113 19 assessment for the following fiscal year.
113 20    The bill appropriates $40 million from the general fund
113 21 of the state to the clean water commission for the fiscal
113 22 year beginning July 1, 2017, and ending June 30, 2018, to
113 23 be credited to the general account of the clean water fund.
113 24 However, the amount of the appropriation is to be reduced by
113 25 any moneys credited to the fund's assessment account due to
113 26 state assessments collected on or before June 30, 2017.
113 27    The commission, in cooperation with the department of
113 28 agriculture and land stewardship, the department of natural
113 29 resources, and the Iowa finance authority, must submit a

113  2 stewardship or a commodity organization for reasonable costs
113  3 of conducting a referendum to determine if a state assessment
113  4 for clean water is to be established, continued, or terminated.
113  5 The commission can also apply to the executive council for
113  6 moneys required to pay for reasonable costs of conducting a
113  7 referendum.  Moneys deposited into the expenditures account
113  8 may also be used to pay refunds to producers who have paid the
113  9 state assessment if the refund application has been approved
113 10 by the commodity organization.  The commission must review
113 11 the balance of moneys in the general account and the balance
113 12 of moneys in the assessment account, prior to the end of
113 13 each fiscal year.  If the total amount of moneys expected
113 14 to be credited to the general account during the following
113 15 fiscal year will not at least equal the balance of moneys in
113 16 the assessment account the commission must order that each
113 17 commodity organization that is imposing and collecting a state
113 18 assessment immediately suspend the imposition of that state
113 19 assessment for the following fiscal year.
113 20    The bill appropriates $40 million from the general fund
113 21 of the state to the clean water commission for the fiscal
113 22 year beginning July 1, 2017, and ending June 30, 2018, to
113 23 be credited to the general account of the clean water fund.
113 24 However, the amount of the appropriation is to be reduced by
113 25 any moneys credited to the fund's assessment account due to
113 26 state assessments collected on or before June 30, 2017.
113 27    The commission, in cooperation with the department of
113 28 agriculture and land stewardship, the department of natural
113 29 resources, and the Iowa finance authority, must submit a
113 30 report to the governor and general assembly by January 15,
113 31 2018, which includes a description of current clean water
113 32 programs and projects and a detailed plan for consolidating all
113 33 water quality and soil conservation initiatives and programs
113 34 and associated projects administered by the department of
113 35 agriculture and land stewardship, the department of natural

111  3    Sec. 132.  NAME CHANGE TO REFERENDUM FOR DIRECT USE.  Nothing
111  4 in this Act requires the department of agriculture and land
111  5 stewardship or a commodity organization described in section
111  6 466B.51, as enacted in this Act, to conduct a referendum
111  7 because of this Act's reference to a referendum as a referendum
111  8 for direct use.
111  9                           EXPLANATION
111 10 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
111 11 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
111 12    This bill relates to agricultural commodity organizations
111 13 representing producers of that commodity that are authorized
111 14 to impose an excise tax or "assessment" (and commonly
111 15 referred to as a "checkoff") on the commodity when first
111 16 sold by the producer to a first purchaser.  The goal of the
111 17 assessment is to fund promotional activities which involve
111 18 market development, research, and education.  The commodity
111 19 organizations include the Iowa dairy industry commission or
111 20 Iowa state dairy association (Code chapter 179), Iowa beef
111 21 cattle producers association (Code chapter 181), Iowa sheep and
111 22 wool promotion board (Code chapter 182), Iowa pork producers
111 23 council or Iowa pork producers association (Code chapter 183A),
111 24 Iowa egg council (Code chapter 184), the Iowa turkey marketing
111 25 council (Code chapter 184A), the Iowa soybean association
111 26 (Code chapter 185), and the Iowa corn promotion board (Code
111 27 chapter 185C).  The bill requires a commodity organization
111 28 to establish a separate state assessment for clean water, if
111 29 approved by a majority of its members at a referendum.  The
111 30 bill also requires commodity organizations to conduct a special
111 31 referendum to increase the rate of the assessment for clean
111 32 water. The rate of the state assessment is established by the
111 33 governing body of the commodity organization not to exceed the
111 34 assessment for direct use or national assessment or both. The
111 35 referendum would be conducted in the same manner as an initial
112  1 or special referendum conducted by the commodity organization
112  2 under its specific Code chapter.  The special assessment could
112  3 be continued or terminated in the same manner as the commodity
112  4 organization's assessment for promotional activities.  Moneys
112  5 from the state assessment would be collected by the commodity
112  6 organization and transferred to a newly created clean water
112  7 fund.
112  8    The bill establishes a clean water commission housed in
112  9 the division of soil conservation and water quality of the
112 10 department of agriculture and land stewardship.  The commission
112 11 is composed of nine voting members appointed by the governor,
112 12 four legislative members who serve in a nonvoting, ex officio
112 13 capacity, and persons appointed by the commodity organizations,
112 14 who also serve in a nonvoting, ex officio capacity.
112 15 Appointments are contingent on the commodity organization
112 16 having approved the establishment of a state assessment for
112 17 clean water to be transferred to the clean water fund. The
112 18 purpose of the commission is to finance methods to improve
112 19 surface water quality, including by reducing contributing
112 20 contaminant loads to receiving surface waters and reducing soil
112 21 erosion and sediment loss. The commission is responsible for
112 22 overseeing the water quality initiative as administered by the
112 23 division of soil conservation and water quality.
112 24    Moneys collected from the state assessment are to be
112 25 credited to the clean water fund which is under the supervision
112 26 of the commission.  The fund is composed of a general account,
112 27 an assessment account, and an expenditures account. The fund's
112 28 general account includes moneys appropriated by the general
112 29 assembly and other moneys available to and obtained or accepted
112 30 by the commission.  Moneys collected from the state assessment
112 31 are to be credited to the assessment account.  The bill also
112 32 includes an expenditures account which only includes moneys
112 33 transferred from the general account and the assessment account
112 34 for purposes of financing methods to improve surface water
112 35 quality.  Moneys transferred from the assessment account are
113  1 to be used to reimburse the department of agriculture and land
113  2 stewardship or a commodity organization for reasonable costs
113  3 of conducting a referendum to determine if a state assessment
113  4 for clean water is to be established, continued, or terminated.
113  5 The commission can also apply to the executive council for
113  6 moneys required to pay for reasonable costs of conducting a
113  7 referendum.  Moneys deposited into the expenditures account
113  8 may also be used to pay refunds to producers who have paid the
113  9 state assessment if the refund application has been approved
113 10 by the commodity organization.  The commission must review
113 11 the balance of moneys in the general account and the balance
113 12 of moneys in the assessment account, prior to the end of
113 13 each fiscal year.  If the total amount of moneys expected
113 14 to be credited to the general account during the following
113 15 fiscal year will not at least equal the balance of moneys in
113 16 the assessment account the commission must order that each
113 17 commodity organization that is imposing and collecting a state
113 18 assessment immediately suspend the imposition of that state
113 19 assessment for the following fiscal year.
113 20    The bill appropriates $40 million from the general fund
113 21 of the state to the clean water commission for the fiscal
113 22 year beginning July 1, 2017, and ending June 30, 2018, to
113 23 be credited to the general account of the clean water fund.
113 24 However, the amount of the appropriation is to be reduced by
113 25 any moneys credited to the fund's assessment account due to
113 26 state assessments collected on or before June 30, 2017.
113 27    The commission, in cooperation with the department of
113 28 agriculture and land stewardship, the department of natural
113 29 resources, and the Iowa finance authority, must submit a

113 12 of moneys in the assessment account, prior to the end of
113 13 each fiscal year.  If the total amount of moneys expected
113 14 to be credited to the general account during the following
113 15 fiscal year will not at least equal the balance of moneys in
113 16 the assessment account the commission must order that each
113 17 commodity organization that is imposing and collecting a state
113 18 assessment immediately suspend the imposition of that state
113 19 assessment for the following fiscal year.
113 20    The bill appropriates $40 million from the general fund
113 21 of the state to the clean water commission for the fiscal
113 22 year beginning July 1, 2017, and ending June 30, 2018, to
113 23 be credited to the general account of the clean water fund.
113 24 However, the amount of the appropriation is to be reduced by
113 25 any moneys credited to the fund's assessment account due to
113 26 state assessments collected on or before June 30, 2017.
113 27    The commission, in cooperation with the department of
113 28 agriculture and land stewardship, the department of natural
113 29 resources, and the Iowa finance authority, must submit a
113 30 report to the governor and general assembly by January 15,
113 31 2018, which includes a description of current clean water
113 32 programs and projects and a detailed plan for consolidating all
113 33 water quality and soil conservation initiatives and programs
113 34 and associated projects administered by the department of
113 35 agriculture and land stewardship, the department of natural

110 29    To be credited to the general account of the clean water fund
110 30 created in section 466B.51:
110 31 .................................................. $ 40,000,000
110 32    2.  The amount of the appropriation made in subsection 1
110 33 shall be reduced by any amount of moneys to be credited to

111  3    Sec. 132.  NAME CHANGE TO REFERENDUM FOR DIRECT USE.  Nothing
111  4 in this Act requires the department of agriculture and land
111  5 stewardship or a commodity organization described in section
111  6 466B.51, as enacted in this Act, to conduct a referendum
111  7 because of this Act's reference to a referendum as a referendum
111  8 for direct use.
111  9                           EXPLANATION
111 10 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
111 11 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
111 12    This bill relates to agricultural commodity organizations
111 13 representing producers of that commodity that are authorized
111 14 to impose an excise tax or "assessment" (and commonly
111 15 referred to as a "checkoff") on the commodity when first
111 16 sold by the producer to a first purchaser.  The goal of the
111 17 assessment is to fund promotional activities which involve
111 18 market development, research, and education.  The commodity
111 19 organizations include the Iowa dairy industry commission or
111 20 Iowa state dairy association (Code chapter 179), Iowa beef
111 21 cattle producers association (Code chapter 181), Iowa sheep and
111 22 wool promotion board (Code chapter 182), Iowa pork producers
111 23 council or Iowa pork producers association (Code chapter 183A),
111 24 Iowa egg council (Code chapter 184), the Iowa turkey marketing
111 25 council (Code chapter 184A), the Iowa soybean association
111 26 (Code chapter 185), and the Iowa corn promotion board (Code
111 27 chapter 185C).  The bill requires a commodity organization
111 28 to establish a separate state assessment for clean water, if
111 29 approved by a majority of its members at a referendum.  The
111 30 bill also requires commodity organizations to conduct a special
111 31 referendum to increase the rate of the assessment for clean
111 32 water. The rate of the state assessment is established by the
111 33 governing body of the commodity organization not to exceed the
111 34 assessment for direct use or national assessment or both. The
111 35 referendum would be conducted in the same manner as an initial
112  1 or special referendum conducted by the commodity organization
112  2 under its specific Code chapter.  The special assessment could
112  3 be continued or terminated in the same manner as the commodity
112  4 organization's assessment for promotional activities.  Moneys
112  5 from the state assessment would be collected by the commodity
112  6 organization and transferred to a newly created clean water
112  7 fund.
112  8    The bill establishes a clean water commission housed in
112  9 the division of soil conservation and water quality of the
112 10 department of agriculture and land stewardship.  The commission
112 11 is composed of nine voting members appointed by the governor,
112 12 four legislative members who serve in a nonvoting, ex officio
112 13 capacity, and persons appointed by the commodity organizations,
112 14 who also serve in a nonvoting, ex officio capacity.
112 15 Appointments are contingent on the commodity organization
112 16 having approved the establishment of a state assessment for
112 17 clean water to be transferred to the clean water fund. The
112 18 purpose of the commission is to finance methods to improve
112 19 surface water quality, including by reducing contributing
112 20 contaminant loads to receiving surface waters and reducing soil
112 21 erosion and sediment loss. The commission is responsible for
112 22 overseeing the water quality initiative as administered by the
112 23 division of soil conservation and water quality.
112 24    Moneys collected from the state assessment are to be
112 25 credited to the clean water fund which is under the supervision
112 26 of the commission.  The fund is composed of a general account,
112 27 an assessment account, and an expenditures account. The fund's
112 28 general account includes moneys appropriated by the general
112 29 assembly and other moneys available to and obtained or accepted
112 30 by the commission.  Moneys collected from the state assessment
112 31 are to be credited to the assessment account.  The bill also
112 32 includes an expenditures account which only includes moneys
112 33 transferred from the general account and the assessment account
112 34 for purposes of financing methods to improve surface water
112 35 quality.  Moneys transferred from the assessment account are
113  1 to be used to reimburse the department of agriculture and land
113  2 stewardship or a commodity organization for reasonable costs
113  3 of conducting a referendum to determine if a state assessment
113  4 for clean water is to be established, continued, or terminated.
113  5 The commission can also apply to the executive council for
113  6 moneys required to pay for reasonable costs of conducting a
113  7 referendum.  Moneys deposited into the expenditures account
113  8 may also be used to pay refunds to producers who have paid the
113  9 state assessment if the refund application has been approved
113 10 by the commodity organization.  The commission must review
113 11 the balance of moneys in the general account and the balance
113 12 of moneys in the assessment account, prior to the end of
113 13 each fiscal year.  If the total amount of moneys expected
113 14 to be credited to the general account during the following
113 15 fiscal year will not at least equal the balance of moneys in
113 16 the assessment account the commission must order that each
113 17 commodity organization that is imposing and collecting a state
113 18 assessment immediately suspend the imposition of that state
113 19 assessment for the following fiscal year.
113 20    The bill appropriates $40 million from the general fund
113 21 of the state to the clean water commission for the fiscal
113 22 year beginning July 1, 2017, and ending June 30, 2018, to
113 23 be credited to the general account of the clean water fund.
113 24 However, the amount of the appropriation is to be reduced by
113 25 any moneys credited to the fund's assessment account due to
113 26 state assessments collected on or before June 30, 2017.
113 27    The commission, in cooperation with the department of
113 28 agriculture and land stewardship, the department of natural
113 29 resources, and the Iowa finance authority, must submit a
113 30 report to the governor and general assembly by January 15,
113 31 2018, which includes a description of current clean water
113 32 programs and projects and a detailed plan for consolidating all
113 33 water quality and soil conservation initiatives and programs
113 34 and associated projects administered by the department of
113 35 agriculture and land stewardship, the department of natural

111  4 in this Act requires the department of agriculture and land
111  5 stewardship or a commodity organization described in section
111  6 466B.51, as enacted in this Act, to conduct a referendum
111  7 because of this Act's reference to a referendum as a referendum
111  8 for direct use.
111  9                           EXPLANATION
111 10 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
111 11 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
111 12    This bill relates to agricultural commodity organizations
111 13 representing producers of that commodity that are authorized
111 14 to impose an excise tax or "assessment" (and commonly
111 15 referred to as a "checkoff") on the commodity when first
111 16 sold by the producer to a first purchaser.  The goal of the
111 17 assessment is to fund promotional activities which involve
111 18 market development, research, and education.  The commodity
111 19 organizations include the Iowa dairy industry commission or
111 20 Iowa state dairy association (Code chapter 179), Iowa beef
111 21 cattle producers association (Code chapter 181), Iowa sheep and
111 22 wool promotion board (Code chapter 182), Iowa pork producers
111 23 council or Iowa pork producers association (Code chapter 183A),
111 24 Iowa egg council (Code chapter 184), the Iowa turkey marketing
111 25 council (Code chapter 184A), the Iowa soybean association
111 26 (Code chapter 185), and the Iowa corn promotion board (Code
111 27 chapter 185C).  The bill requires a commodity organization
111 28 to establish a separate state assessment for clean water, if
111 29 approved by a majority of its members at a referendum.  The
111 30 bill also requires commodity organizations to conduct a special
111 31 referendum to increase the rate of the assessment for clean
111 32 water. The rate of the state assessment is established by the
111 33 governing body of the commodity organization not to exceed the
111 34 assessment for direct use or national assessment or both. The
111 35 referendum would be conducted in the same manner as an initial
112  1 or special referendum conducted by the commodity organization
112  2 under its specific Code chapter.  The special assessment could
112  3 be continued or terminated in the same manner as the commodity
112  4 organization's assessment for promotional activities.  Moneys
112  5 from the state assessment would be collected by the commodity
112  6 organization and transferred to a newly created clean water
112  7 fund.
112  8    The bill establishes a clean water commission housed in
112  9 the division of soil conservation and water quality of the
112 10 department of agriculture and land stewardship.  The commission
112 11 is composed of nine voting members appointed by the governor,
112 12 four legislative members who serve in a nonvoting, ex officio
112 13 capacity, and persons appointed by the commodity organizations,
112 14 who also serve in a nonvoting, ex officio capacity.
112 15 Appointments are contingent on the commodity organization
112 16 having approved the establishment of a state assessment for
112 17 clean water to be transferred to the clean water fund. The
112 18 purpose of the commission is to finance methods to improve
112 19 surface water quality, including by reducing contributing
112 20 contaminant loads to receiving surface waters and reducing soil
112 21 erosion and sediment loss. The commission is responsible for
112 22 overseeing the water quality initiative as administered by the
112 23 division of soil conservation and water quality.
112 24    Moneys collected from the state assessment are to be
112 25 credited to the clean water fund which is under the supervision
112 26 of the commission.  The fund is composed of a general account,
112 27 an assessment account, and an expenditures account. The fund's
112 28 general account includes moneys appropriated by the general
112 29 assembly and other moneys available to and obtained or accepted
112 30 by the commission.  Moneys collected from the state assessment
112 31 are to be credited to the assessment account.  The bill also
112 32 includes an expenditures account which only includes moneys
112 33 transferred from the general account and the assessment account
112 34 for purposes of financing methods to improve surface water
112 35 quality.  Moneys transferred from the assessment account are
113  1 to be used to reimburse the department of agriculture and land
113  2 stewardship or a commodity organization for reasonable costs
113  3 of conducting a referendum to determine if a state assessment
113  4 for clean water is to be established, continued, or terminated.
113  5 The commission can also apply to the executive council for
113  6 moneys required to pay for reasonable costs of conducting a
113  7 referendum.  Moneys deposited into the expenditures account
113  8 may also be used to pay refunds to producers who have paid the
113  9 state assessment if the refund application has been approved
113 10 by the commodity organization.  The commission must review
113 11 the balance of moneys in the general account and the balance
113 12 of moneys in the assessment account, prior to the end of
113 13 each fiscal year.  If the total amount of moneys expected
113 14 to be credited to the general account during the following
113 15 fiscal year will not at least equal the balance of moneys in
113 16 the assessment account the commission must order that each
113 17 commodity organization that is imposing and collecting a state
113 18 assessment immediately suspend the imposition of that state
113 19 assessment for the following fiscal year.
113 20    The bill appropriates $40 million from the general fund
113 21 of the state to the clean water commission for the fiscal
113 22 year beginning July 1, 2017, and ending June 30, 2018, to
113 23 be credited to the general account of the clean water fund.
113 24 However, the amount of the appropriation is to be reduced by
113 25 any moneys credited to the fund's assessment account due to
113 26 state assessments collected on or before June 30, 2017.
113 27    The commission, in cooperation with the department of
113 28 agriculture and land stewardship, the department of natural
113 29 resources, and the Iowa finance authority, must submit a
113 30 report to the governor and general assembly by January 15,
113 31 2018, which includes a description of current clean water
113 32 programs and projects and a detailed plan for consolidating all
113 33 water quality and soil conservation initiatives and programs
113 34 and associated projects administered by the department of
113 35 agriculture and land stewardship, the department of natural
114  1 resources, and the Iowa finance authority under the overall

111 13 representing producers of that commodity that are authorized
111 14 to impose an excise tax or "assessment" (and commonly
111 15 referred to as a "checkoff") on the commodity when first

111 19 organizations include the Iowa dairy industry commission or
111 20 Iowa state dairy association (Code chapter 179), Iowa beef
111 21 cattle producers association (Code chapter 181), Iowa sheep and
111 22 wool promotion board (Code chapter 182), Iowa pork producers
111 23 council or Iowa pork producers association (Code chapter 183A),
111 24 Iowa egg council (Code chapter 184), the Iowa turkey marketing
111 25 council (Code chapter 184A), the Iowa soybean association
111 26 (Code chapter 185), and the Iowa corn promotion board (Code
111 27 chapter 185C).  The bill requires a commodity organization
111 28 to establish a separate state assessment for clean water, if
111 29 approved by a majority of its members at a referendum.  The
111 30 bill also requires commodity organizations to conduct a special
111 31 referendum to increase the rate of the assessment for clean
111 32 water. The rate of the state assessment is established by the
111 33 governing body of the commodity organization not to exceed the
111 34 assessment for direct use or national assessment or both. The
111 35 referendum would be conducted in the same manner as an initial
112  1 or special referendum conducted by the commodity organization
112  2 under its specific Code chapter.  The special assessment could
112  3 be continued or terminated in the same manner as the commodity
112  4 organization's assessment for promotional activities.  Moneys
112  5 from the state assessment would be collected by the commodity
112  6 organization and transferred to a newly created clean water
112  7 fund.
112  8    The bill establishes a clean water commission housed in
112  9 the division of soil conservation and water quality of the
112 10 department of agriculture and land stewardship.  The commission
112 11 is composed of nine voting members appointed by the governor,
112 12 four legislative members who serve in a nonvoting, ex officio
112 13 capacity, and persons appointed by the commodity organizations,
112 14 who also serve in a nonvoting, ex officio capacity.
112 15 Appointments are contingent on the commodity organization
112 16 having approved the establishment of a state assessment for
112 17 clean water to be transferred to the clean water fund. The
112 18 purpose of the commission is to finance methods to improve
112 19 surface water quality, including by reducing contributing

112 21 erosion and sediment loss. The commission is responsible for
112 22 overseeing the water quality initiative as administered by the
112 23 division of soil conservation and water quality.
112 24    Moneys collected from the state assessment are to be
112 25 credited to the clean water fund which is under the supervision
112 26 of the commission.  The fund is composed of a general account,
112 27 an assessment account, and an expenditures account. The fund's
112 28 general account includes moneys appropriated by the general
112 29 assembly and other moneys available to and obtained or accepted
112 30 by the commission.  Moneys collected from the state assessment
112 31 are to be credited to the assessment account.  The bill also
112 32 includes an expenditures account which only includes moneys
112 33 transferred from the general account and the assessment account
112 34 for purposes of financing methods to improve surface water
112 35 quality.  Moneys transferred from the assessment account are
113  1 to be used to reimburse the department of agriculture and land
113  2 stewardship or a commodity organization for reasonable costs
113  3 of conducting a referendum to determine if a state assessment
113  4 for clean water is to be established, continued, or terminated.
113  5 The commission can also apply to the executive council for
113  6 moneys required to pay for reasonable costs of conducting a
113  7 referendum.  Moneys deposited into the expenditures account
113  8 may also be used to pay refunds to producers who have paid the
113  9 state assessment if the refund application has been approved
113 10 by the commodity organization.  The commission must review
113 11 the balance of moneys in the general account and the balance
113 12 of moneys in the assessment account, prior to the end of
113 13 each fiscal year.  If the total amount of moneys expected
113 14 to be credited to the general account during the following
113 15 fiscal year will not at least equal the balance of moneys in
113 16 the assessment account the commission must order that each
113 17 commodity organization that is imposing and collecting a state
113 18 assessment immediately suspend the imposition of that state
113 19 assessment for the following fiscal year.
113 20    The bill appropriates $40 million from the general fund
113 21 of the state to the clean water commission for the fiscal
113 22 year beginning July 1, 2017, and ending June 30, 2018, to
113 23 be credited to the general account of the clean water fund.
113 24 However, the amount of the appropriation is to be reduced by
113 25 any moneys credited to the fund's assessment account due to
113 26 state assessments collected on or before June 30, 2017.
113 27    The commission, in cooperation with the department of
113 28 agriculture and land stewardship, the department of natural

111  4 in this Act requires the department of agriculture and land
111  5 stewardship or a commodity organization described in section
111  6 466B.51, as enacted in this Act, to conduct a referendum
111  7 because of this Act's reference to a referendum as a referendum
111  8 for direct use.
111  9                           EXPLANATION
111 10 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
111 11 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
111 12    This bill relates to agricultural commodity organizations
111 13 representing producers of that commodity that are authorized
111 14 to impose an excise tax or "assessment" (and commonly
111 15 referred to as a "checkoff") on the commodity when first
111 16 sold by the producer to a first purchaser.  The goal of the
111 17 assessment is to fund promotional activities which involve
111 18 market development, research, and education.  The commodity
111 19 organizations include the Iowa dairy industry commission or
111 20 Iowa state dairy association (Code chapter 179), Iowa beef
111 21 cattle producers association (Code chapter 181), Iowa sheep and
111 22 wool promotion board (Code chapter 182), Iowa pork producers
111 23 council or Iowa pork producers association (Code chapter 183A),
111 24 Iowa egg council (Code chapter 184), the Iowa turkey marketing
111 25 council (Code chapter 184A), the Iowa soybean association
111 26 (Code chapter 185), and the Iowa corn promotion board (Code
111 27 chapter 185C).  The bill requires a commodity organization
111 28 to establish a separate state assessment for clean water, if
111 29 approved by a majority of its members at a referendum.  The
111 30 bill also requires commodity organizations to conduct a special
111 31 referendum to increase the rate of the assessment for clean
111 32 water. The rate of the state assessment is established by the
111 33 governing body of the commodity organization not to exceed the
111 34 assessment for direct use or national assessment or both. The
111 35 referendum would be conducted in the same manner as an initial
112  1 or special referendum conducted by the commodity organization
112  2 under its specific Code chapter.  The special assessment could
112  3 be continued or terminated in the same manner as the commodity
112  4 organization's assessment for promotional activities.  Moneys
112  5 from the state assessment would be collected by the commodity
112  6 organization and transferred to a newly created clean water
112  7 fund.
112  8    The bill establishes a clean water commission housed in
112  9 the division of soil conservation and water quality of the
112 10 department of agriculture and land stewardship.  The commission
112 11 is composed of nine voting members appointed by the governor,
112 12 four legislative members who serve in a nonvoting, ex officio
112 13 capacity, and persons appointed by the commodity organizations,
112 14 who also serve in a nonvoting, ex officio capacity.
112 15 Appointments are contingent on the commodity organization
112 16 having approved the establishment of a state assessment for
112 17 clean water to be transferred to the clean water fund. The
112 18 purpose of the commission is to finance methods to improve
112 19 surface water quality, including by reducing contributing
112 20 contaminant loads to receiving surface waters and reducing soil
112 21 erosion and sediment loss. The commission is responsible for
112 22 overseeing the water quality initiative as administered by the
112 23 division of soil conservation and water quality.
112 24    Moneys collected from the state assessment are to be
112 25 credited to the clean water fund which is under the supervision
112 26 of the commission.  The fund is composed of a general account,
112 27 an assessment account, and an expenditures account. The fund's
112 28 general account includes moneys appropriated by the general
112 29 assembly and other moneys available to and obtained or accepted
112 30 by the commission.  Moneys collected from the state assessment
112 31 are to be credited to the assessment account.  The bill also
112 32 includes an expenditures account which only includes moneys
112 33 transferred from the general account and the assessment account
112 34 for purposes of financing methods to improve surface water
112 35 quality.  Moneys transferred from the assessment account are
113  1 to be used to reimburse the department of agriculture and land
113  2 stewardship or a commodity organization for reasonable costs
113  3 of conducting a referendum to determine if a state assessment
113  4 for clean water is to be established, continued, or terminated.
113  5 The commission can also apply to the executive council for
113  6 moneys required to pay for reasonable costs of conducting a
113  7 referendum.  Moneys deposited into the expenditures account
113  8 may also be used to pay refunds to producers who have paid the
113  9 state assessment if the refund application has been approved
113 10 by the commodity organization.  The commission must review
113 11 the balance of moneys in the general account and the balance
113 12 of moneys in the assessment account, prior to the end of
113 13 each fiscal year.  If the total amount of moneys expected
113 14 to be credited to the general account during the following
113 15 fiscal year will not at least equal the balance of moneys in
113 16 the assessment account the commission must order that each
113 17 commodity organization that is imposing and collecting a state
113 18 assessment immediately suspend the imposition of that state
113 19 assessment for the following fiscal year.
113 20    The bill appropriates $40 million from the general fund
113 21 of the state to the clean water commission for the fiscal
113 22 year beginning July 1, 2017, and ending June 30, 2018, to
113 23 be credited to the general account of the clean water fund.
113 24 However, the amount of the appropriation is to be reduced by
113 25 any moneys credited to the fund's assessment account due to
113 26 state assessments collected on or before June 30, 2017.
113 27    The commission, in cooperation with the department of
113 28 agriculture and land stewardship, the department of natural
113 29 resources, and the Iowa finance authority, must submit a
113 30 report to the governor and general assembly by January 15,
113 31 2018, which includes a description of current clean water
113 32 programs and projects and a detailed plan for consolidating all
113 33 water quality and soil conservation initiatives and programs
113 34 and associated projects administered by the department of
113 35 agriculture and land stewardship, the department of natural
114  1 resources, and the Iowa finance authority under the overall

112  5 from the state assessment would be collected by the commodity
112  6 organization and transferred to a newly created clean water
112  7 fund.
112  8    The bill establishes a clean water commission housed in
112  9 the division of soil conservation and water quality of the
112 10 department of agriculture and land stewardship.  The commission
112 11 is composed of nine voting members appointed by the governor,
112 12 four legislative members who serve in a nonvoting, ex officio
112 13 capacity, and persons appointed by the commodity organizations,
112 14 who also serve in a nonvoting, ex officio capacity.
112 15 Appointments are contingent on the commodity organization

112 26 of the commission.  The fund is composed of a general account,
112 27 an assessment account, and an expenditures account. The fund's
112 28 general account includes moneys appropriated by the general
112 29 assembly and other moneys available to and obtained or accepted
112 30 by the commission.  Moneys collected from the state assessment
112 31 are to be credited to the assessment account.  The bill also
112 32 includes an expenditures account which only includes moneys
112 33 transferred from the general account and the assessment account
112 34 for purposes of financing methods to improve surface water
112 35 quality.  Moneys transferred from the assessment account are
113  1 to be used to reimburse the department of agriculture and land
113  2 stewardship or a commodity organization for reasonable costs
113  3 of conducting a referendum to determine if a state assessment
113  4 for clean water is to be established, continued, or terminated.
113  5 The commission can also apply to the executive council for
113  6 moneys required to pay for reasonable costs of conducting a

113  8 may also be used to pay refunds to producers who have paid the

113 10 by the commodity organization.  The commission must review
113 11 the balance of moneys in the general account and the balance
113 12 of moneys in the assessment account, prior to the end of
113 13 each fiscal year.  If the total amount of moneys expected
113 14 to be credited to the general account during the following
113 15 fiscal year will not at least equal the balance of moneys in
113 16 the assessment account the commission must order that each
113 17 commodity organization that is imposing and collecting a state
113 18 assessment immediately suspend the imposition of that state
113 19 assessment for the following fiscal year.
113 20    The bill appropriates $40 million from the general fund

111 12    This bill relates to agricultural commodity organizations
111 13 representing producers of that commodity that are authorized
111 14 to impose an excise tax or "assessment" (and commonly
111 15 referred to as a "checkoff") on the commodity when first
111 16 sold by the producer to a first purchaser.  The goal of the
111 17 assessment is to fund promotional activities which involve
111 18 market development, research, and education.  The commodity
111 19 organizations include the Iowa dairy industry commission or
111 20 Iowa state dairy association (Code chapter 179), Iowa beef
111 21 cattle producers association (Code chapter 181), Iowa sheep and
111 22 wool promotion board (Code chapter 182), Iowa pork producers
111 23 council or Iowa pork producers association (Code chapter 183A),
111 24 Iowa egg council (Code chapter 184), the Iowa turkey marketing
111 25 council (Code chapter 184A), the Iowa soybean association
111 26 (Code chapter 185), and the Iowa corn promotion board (Code
111 27 chapter 185C).  The bill requires a commodity organization
111 28 to establish a separate state assessment for clean water, if
111 29 approved by a majority of its members at a referendum.  The
111 30 bill also requires commodity organizations to conduct a special
111 31 referendum to increase the rate of the assessment for clean
111 32 water. The rate of the state assessment is established by the
111 33 governing body of the commodity organization not to exceed the
111 34 assessment for direct use or national assessment or both. The
111 35 referendum would be conducted in the same manner as an initial
112  1 or special referendum conducted by the commodity organization
112  2 under its specific Code chapter.  The special assessment could
112  3 be continued or terminated in the same manner as the commodity
112  4 organization's assessment for promotional activities.  Moneys
112  5 from the state assessment would be collected by the commodity
112  6 organization and transferred to a newly created clean water
112  7 fund.
112  8    The bill establishes a clean water commission housed in
112  9 the division of soil conservation and water quality of the
112 10 department of agriculture and land stewardship.  The commission
112 11 is composed of nine voting members appointed by the governor,
112 12 four legislative members who serve in a nonvoting, ex officio
112 13 capacity, and persons appointed by the commodity organizations,
112 14 who also serve in a nonvoting, ex officio capacity.
112 15 Appointments are contingent on the commodity organization
112 16 having approved the establishment of a state assessment for
112 17 clean water to be transferred to the clean water fund. The
112 18 purpose of the commission is to finance methods to improve
112 19 surface water quality, including by reducing contributing
112 20 contaminant loads to receiving surface waters and reducing soil
112 21 erosion and sediment loss. The commission is responsible for
112 22 overseeing the water quality initiative as administered by the
112 23 division of soil conservation and water quality.
112 24    Moneys collected from the state assessment are to be
112 25 credited to the clean water fund which is under the supervision
112 26 of the commission.  The fund is composed of a general account,
112 27 an assessment account, and an expenditures account. The fund's
112 28 general account includes moneys appropriated by the general
112 29 assembly and other moneys available to and obtained or accepted
112 30 by the commission.  Moneys collected from the state assessment
112 31 are to be credited to the assessment account.  The bill also
112 32 includes an expenditures account which only includes moneys
112 33 transferred from the general account and the assessment account
112 34 for purposes of financing methods to improve surface water
112 35 quality.  Moneys transferred from the assessment account are
113  1 to be used to reimburse the department of agriculture and land
113  2 stewardship or a commodity organization for reasonable costs
113  3 of conducting a referendum to determine if a state assessment
113  4 for clean water is to be established, continued, or terminated.
113  5 The commission can also apply to the executive council for
113  6 moneys required to pay for reasonable costs of conducting a
113  7 referendum.  Moneys deposited into the expenditures account
113  8 may also be used to pay refunds to producers who have paid the
113  9 state assessment if the refund application has been approved
113 10 by the commodity organization.  The commission must review
113 11 the balance of moneys in the general account and the balance
113 12 of moneys in the assessment account, prior to the end of
113 13 each fiscal year.  If the total amount of moneys expected
113 14 to be credited to the general account during the following
113 15 fiscal year will not at least equal the balance of moneys in
113 16 the assessment account the commission must order that each
113 17 commodity organization that is imposing and collecting a state
113 18 assessment immediately suspend the imposition of that state
113 19 assessment for the following fiscal year.
113 20    The bill appropriates $40 million from the general fund
113 21 of the state to the clean water commission for the fiscal
113 22 year beginning July 1, 2017, and ending June 30, 2018, to
113 23 be credited to the general account of the clean water fund.
113 24 However, the amount of the appropriation is to be reduced by
113 25 any moneys credited to the fund's assessment account due to
113 26 state assessments collected on or before June 30, 2017.
113 27    The commission, in cooperation with the department of
113 28 agriculture and land stewardship, the department of natural
113 29 resources, and the Iowa finance authority, must submit a
113 30 report to the governor and general assembly by January 15,
113 31 2018, which includes a description of current clean water
113 32 programs and projects and a detailed plan for consolidating all
113 33 water quality and soil conservation initiatives and programs
113 34 and associated projects administered by the department of
113 35 agriculture and land stewardship, the department of natural
114  1 resources, and the Iowa finance authority under the overall
114  2 supervision of the commission.

111  8 for direct use.
111  9                           EXPLANATION
111 10 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
111 11 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
111 12    This bill relates to agricultural commodity organizations
111 13 representing producers of that commodity that are authorized
111 14 to impose an excise tax or "assessment" (and commonly
111 15 referred to as a "checkoff") on the commodity when first
111 16 sold by the producer to a first purchaser.  The goal of the
111 17 assessment is to fund promotional activities which involve
111 18 market development, research, and education.  The commodity
111 19 organizations include the Iowa dairy industry commission or
111 20 Iowa state dairy association (Code chapter 179), Iowa beef
111 21 cattle producers association (Code chapter 181), Iowa sheep and
111 22 wool promotion board (Code chapter 182), Iowa pork producers
111 23 council or Iowa pork producers association (Code chapter 183A),
111 24 Iowa egg council (Code chapter 184), the Iowa turkey marketing
111 25 council (Code chapter 184A), the Iowa soybean association
111 26 (Code chapter 185), and the Iowa corn promotion board (Code
111 27 chapter 185C).  The bill requires a commodity organization
111 28 to establish a separate state assessment for clean water, if
111 29 approved by a majority of its members at a referendum.  The
111 30 bill also requires commodity organizations to conduct a special
111 31 referendum to increase the rate of the assessment for clean
111 32 water. The rate of the state assessment is established by the
111 33 governing body of the commodity organization not to exceed the
111 34 assessment for direct use or national assessment or both. The
111 35 referendum would be conducted in the same manner as an initial
112  1 or special referendum conducted by the commodity organization
112  2 under its specific Code chapter.  The special assessment could
112  3 be continued or terminated in the same manner as the commodity
112  4 organization's assessment for promotional activities.  Moneys
112  5 from the state assessment would be collected by the commodity
112  6 organization and transferred to a newly created clean water
112  7 fund.
112  8    The bill establishes a clean water commission housed in
112  9 the division of soil conservation and water quality of the
112 10 department of agriculture and land stewardship.  The commission
112 11 is composed of nine voting members appointed by the governor,
112 12 four legislative members who serve in a nonvoting, ex officio
112 13 capacity, and persons appointed by the commodity organizations,
112 14 who also serve in a nonvoting, ex officio capacity.
112 15 Appointments are contingent on the commodity organization
112 16 having approved the establishment of a state assessment for
112 17 clean water to be transferred to the clean water fund. The
112 18 purpose of the commission is to finance methods to improve
112 19 surface water quality, including by reducing contributing
112 20 contaminant loads to receiving surface waters and reducing soil
112 21 erosion and sediment loss. The commission is responsible for
112 22 overseeing the water quality initiative as administered by the
112 23 division of soil conservation and water quality.
112 24    Moneys collected from the state assessment are to be
112 25 credited to the clean water fund which is under the supervision
112 26 of the commission.  The fund is composed of a general account,
112 27 an assessment account, and an expenditures account. The fund's
112 28 general account includes moneys appropriated by the general
112 29 assembly and other moneys available to and obtained or accepted
112 30 by the commission.  Moneys collected from the state assessment
112 31 are to be credited to the assessment account.  The bill also
112 32 includes an expenditures account which only includes moneys
112 33 transferred from the general account and the assessment account
112 34 for purposes of financing methods to improve surface water
112 35 quality.  Moneys transferred from the assessment account are
113  1 to be used to reimburse the department of agriculture and land
113  2 stewardship or a commodity organization for reasonable costs
113  3 of conducting a referendum to determine if a state assessment
113  4 for clean water is to be established, continued, or terminated.
113  5 The commission can also apply to the executive council for
113  6 moneys required to pay for reasonable costs of conducting a
113  7 referendum.  Moneys deposited into the expenditures account
113  8 may also be used to pay refunds to producers who have paid the
113  9 state assessment if the refund application has been approved
113 10 by the commodity organization.  The commission must review
113 11 the balance of moneys in the general account and the balance
113 12 of moneys in the assessment account, prior to the end of
113 13 each fiscal year.  If the total amount of moneys expected
113 14 to be credited to the general account during the following
113 15 fiscal year will not at least equal the balance of moneys in
113 16 the assessment account the commission must order that each
113 17 commodity organization that is imposing and collecting a state
113 18 assessment immediately suspend the imposition of that state
113 19 assessment for the following fiscal year.
113 20    The bill appropriates $40 million from the general fund
113 21 of the state to the clean water commission for the fiscal
113 22 year beginning July 1, 2017, and ending June 30, 2018, to
113 23 be credited to the general account of the clean water fund.
113 24 However, the amount of the appropriation is to be reduced by
113 25 any moneys credited to the fund's assessment account due to
113 26 state assessments collected on or before June 30, 2017.
113 27    The commission, in cooperation with the department of
113 28 agriculture and land stewardship, the department of natural
113 29 resources, and the Iowa finance authority, must submit a
113 30 report to the governor and general assembly by January 15,
113 31 2018, which includes a description of current clean water
113 32 programs and projects and a detailed plan for consolidating all
113 33 water quality and soil conservation initiatives and programs
113 34 and associated projects administered by the department of
113 35 agriculture and land stewardship, the department of natural
114  1 resources, and the Iowa finance authority under the overall

111 10 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
111 11 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
111 12    This bill relates to agricultural commodity organizations
111 13 representing producers of that commodity that are authorized
111 14 to impose an excise tax or "assessment" (and commonly
111 15 referred to as a "checkoff") on the commodity when first
111 16 sold by the producer to a first purchaser.  The goal of the
111 17 assessment is to fund promotional activities which involve
111 18 market development, research, and education.  The commodity
111 19 organizations include the Iowa dairy industry commission or
111 20 Iowa state dairy association (Code chapter 179), Iowa beef
111 21 cattle producers association (Code chapter 181), Iowa sheep and
111 22 wool promotion board (Code chapter 182), Iowa pork producers
111 23 council or Iowa pork producers association (Code chapter 183A),
111 24 Iowa egg council (Code chapter 184), the Iowa turkey marketing
111 25 council (Code chapter 184A), the Iowa soybean association
111 26 (Code chapter 185), and the Iowa corn promotion board (Code
111 27 chapter 185C).  The bill requires a commodity organization
111 28 to establish a separate state assessment for clean water, if
111 29 approved by a majority of its members at a referendum.  The
111 30 bill also requires commodity organizations to conduct a special
111 31 referendum to increase the rate of the assessment for clean
111 32 water. The rate of the state assessment is established by the
111 33 governing body of the commodity organization not to exceed the
111 34 assessment for direct use or national assessment or both. The
111 35 referendum would be conducted in the same manner as an initial
112  1 or special referendum conducted by the commodity organization
112  2 under its specific Code chapter.  The special assessment could
112  3 be continued or terminated in the same manner as the commodity
112  4 organization's assessment for promotional activities.  Moneys
112  5 from the state assessment would be collected by the commodity
112  6 organization and transferred to a newly created clean water
112  7 fund.
112  8    The bill establishes a clean water commission housed in
112  9 the division of soil conservation and water quality of the
112 10 department of agriculture and land stewardship.  The commission
112 11 is composed of nine voting members appointed by the governor,
112 12 four legislative members who serve in a nonvoting, ex officio
112 13 capacity, and persons appointed by the commodity organizations,
112 14 who also serve in a nonvoting, ex officio capacity.
112 15 Appointments are contingent on the commodity organization
112 16 having approved the establishment of a state assessment for
112 17 clean water to be transferred to the clean water fund. The
112 18 purpose of the commission is to finance methods to improve
112 19 surface water quality, including by reducing contributing
112 20 contaminant loads to receiving surface waters and reducing soil
112 21 erosion and sediment loss. The commission is responsible for
112 22 overseeing the water quality initiative as administered by the
112 23 division of soil conservation and water quality.
112 24    Moneys collected from the state assessment are to be
112 25 credited to the clean water fund which is under the supervision
112 26 of the commission.  The fund is composed of a general account,
112 27 an assessment account, and an expenditures account. The fund's
112 28 general account includes moneys appropriated by the general
112 29 assembly and other moneys available to and obtained or accepted
112 30 by the commission.  Moneys collected from the state assessment
112 31 are to be credited to the assessment account.  The bill also
112 32 includes an expenditures account which only includes moneys
112 33 transferred from the general account and the assessment account
112 34 for purposes of financing methods to improve surface water
112 35 quality.  Moneys transferred from the assessment account are
113  1 to be used to reimburse the department of agriculture and land
113  2 stewardship or a commodity organization for reasonable costs
113  3 of conducting a referendum to determine if a state assessment
113  4 for clean water is to be established, continued, or terminated.
113  5 The commission can also apply to the executive council for
113  6 moneys required to pay for reasonable costs of conducting a
113  7 referendum.  Moneys deposited into the expenditures account
113  8 may also be used to pay refunds to producers who have paid the
113  9 state assessment if the refund application has been approved
113 10 by the commodity organization.  The commission must review
113 11 the balance of moneys in the general account and the balance
113 12 of moneys in the assessment account, prior to the end of
113 13 each fiscal year.  If the total amount of moneys expected
113 14 to be credited to the general account during the following
113 15 fiscal year will not at least equal the balance of moneys in
113 16 the assessment account the commission must order that each
113 17 commodity organization that is imposing and collecting a state
113 18 assessment immediately suspend the imposition of that state
113 19 assessment for the following fiscal year.
113 20    The bill appropriates $40 million from the general fund
113 21 of the state to the clean water commission for the fiscal
113 22 year beginning July 1, 2017, and ending June 30, 2018, to
113 23 be credited to the general account of the clean water fund.
113 24 However, the amount of the appropriation is to be reduced by
113 25 any moneys credited to the fund's assessment account due to
113 26 state assessments collected on or before June 30, 2017.
113 27    The commission, in cooperation with the department of
113 28 agriculture and land stewardship, the department of natural
113 29 resources, and the Iowa finance authority, must submit a
113 30 report to the governor and general assembly by January 15,
113 31 2018, which includes a description of current clean water
113 32 programs and projects and a detailed plan for consolidating all
113 33 water quality and soil conservation initiatives and programs
113 34 and associated projects administered by the department of
113 35 agriculture and land stewardship, the department of natural

111 10 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
111 11 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
111 12    This bill relates to agricultural commodity organizations
111 13 representing producers of that commodity that are authorized
111 14 to impose an excise tax or "assessment" (and commonly
111 15 referred to as a "checkoff") on the commodity when first
111 16 sold by the producer to a first purchaser.  The goal of the
111 17 assessment is to fund promotional activities which involve
111 18 market development, research, and education.  The commodity
111 19 organizations include the Iowa dairy industry commission or
111 20 Iowa state dairy association (Code chapter 179), Iowa beef
111 21 cattle producers association (Code chapter 181), Iowa sheep and
111 22 wool promotion board (Code chapter 182), Iowa pork producers
111 23 council or Iowa pork producers association (Code chapter 183A),
111 24 Iowa egg council (Code chapter 184), the Iowa turkey marketing
111 25 council (Code chapter 184A), the Iowa soybean association
111 26 (Code chapter 185), and the Iowa corn promotion board (Code
111 27 chapter 185C).  The bill requires a commodity organization
111 28 to establish a separate state assessment for clean water, if
111 29 approved by a majority of its members at a referendum.  The
111 30 bill also requires commodity organizations to conduct a special
111 31 referendum to increase the rate of the assessment for clean
111 32 water. The rate of the state assessment is established by the
111 33 governing body of the commodity organization not to exceed the
111 34 assessment for direct use or national assessment or both. The
111 35 referendum would be conducted in the same manner as an initial
112  1 or special referendum conducted by the commodity organization
112  2 under its specific Code chapter.  The special assessment could
112  3 be continued or terminated in the same manner as the commodity
112  4 organization's assessment for promotional activities.  Moneys
112  5 from the state assessment would be collected by the commodity
112  6 organization and transferred to a newly created clean water
112  7 fund.
112  8    The bill establishes a clean water commission housed in
112  9 the division of soil conservation and water quality of the
112 10 department of agriculture and land stewardship.  The commission
112 11 is composed of nine voting members appointed by the governor,
112 12 four legislative members who serve in a nonvoting, ex officio
112 13 capacity, and persons appointed by the commodity organizations,
112 14 who also serve in a nonvoting, ex officio capacity.
112 15 Appointments are contingent on the commodity organization
112 16 having approved the establishment of a state assessment for
112 17 clean water to be transferred to the clean water fund. The

112 23 division of soil conservation and water quality.
112 24    Moneys collected from the state assessment are to be
112 25 credited to the clean water fund which is under the supervision
112 26 of the commission.  The fund is composed of a general account,
112 27 an assessment account, and an expenditures account. The fund's
112 28 general account includes moneys appropriated by the general
112 29 assembly and other moneys available to and obtained or accepted
112 30 by the commission.  Moneys collected from the state assessment
112 31 are to be credited to the assessment account.  The bill also
112 32 includes an expenditures account which only includes moneys
112 33 transferred from the general account and the assessment account
112 34 for purposes of financing methods to improve surface water
112 35 quality.  Moneys transferred from the assessment account are
113  1 to be used to reimburse the department of agriculture and land
113  2 stewardship or a commodity organization for reasonable costs
113  3 of conducting a referendum to determine if a state assessment
113  4 for clean water is to be established, continued, or terminated.
113  5 The commission can also apply to the executive council for
113  6 moneys required to pay for reasonable costs of conducting a
113  7 referendum.  Moneys deposited into the expenditures account
113  8 may also be used to pay refunds to producers who have paid the
113  9 state assessment if the refund application has been approved
113 10 by the commodity organization.  The commission must review
113 11 the balance of moneys in the general account and the balance
113 12 of moneys in the assessment account, prior to the end of
113 13 each fiscal year.  If the total amount of moneys expected
113 14 to be credited to the general account during the following
113 15 fiscal year will not at least equal the balance of moneys in
113 16 the assessment account the commission must order that each
113 17 commodity organization that is imposing and collecting a state
113 18 assessment immediately suspend the imposition of that state
113 19 assessment for the following fiscal year.
113 20    The bill appropriates $40 million from the general fund
113 21 of the state to the clean water commission for the fiscal
113 22 year beginning July 1, 2017, and ending June 30, 2018, to
113 23 be credited to the general account of the clean water fund.

111  4 in this Act requires the department of agriculture and land
111  5 stewardship or a commodity organization described in section
111  6 466B.51, as enacted in this Act, to conduct a referendum
111  7 because of this Act's reference to a referendum as a referendum
111  8 for direct use.
111  9                           EXPLANATION
111 10 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
111 11 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
111 12    This bill relates to agricultural commodity organizations
111 13 representing producers of that commodity that are authorized
111 14 to impose an excise tax or "assessment" (and commonly
111 15 referred to as a "checkoff") on the commodity when first
111 16 sold by the producer to a first purchaser.  The goal of the
111 17 assessment is to fund promotional activities which involve
111 18 market development, research, and education.  The commodity
111 19 organizations include the Iowa dairy industry commission or
111 20 Iowa state dairy association (Code chapter 179), Iowa beef
111 21 cattle producers association (Code chapter 181), Iowa sheep and
111 22 wool promotion board (Code chapter 182), Iowa pork producers
111 23 council or Iowa pork producers association (Code chapter 183A),
111 24 Iowa egg council (Code chapter 184), the Iowa turkey marketing
111 25 council (Code chapter 184A), the Iowa soybean association
111 26 (Code chapter 185), and the Iowa corn promotion board (Code
111 27 chapter 185C).  The bill requires a commodity organization
111 28 to establish a separate state assessment for clean water, if
111 29 approved by a majority of its members at a referendum.  The
111 30 bill also requires commodity organizations to conduct a special
111 31 referendum to increase the rate of the assessment for clean
111 32 water. The rate of the state assessment is established by the
111 33 governing body of the commodity organization not to exceed the
111 34 assessment for direct use or national assessment or both. The
111 35 referendum would be conducted in the same manner as an initial
112  1 or special referendum conducted by the commodity organization
112  2 under its specific Code chapter.  The special assessment could
112  3 be continued or terminated in the same manner as the commodity
112  4 organization's assessment for promotional activities.  Moneys
112  5 from the state assessment would be collected by the commodity
112  6 organization and transferred to a newly created clean water
112  7 fund.
112  8    The bill establishes a clean water commission housed in
112  9 the division of soil conservation and water quality of the
112 10 department of agriculture and land stewardship.  The commission
112 11 is composed of nine voting members appointed by the governor,
112 12 four legislative members who serve in a nonvoting, ex officio
112 13 capacity, and persons appointed by the commodity organizations,
112 14 who also serve in a nonvoting, ex officio capacity.
112 15 Appointments are contingent on the commodity organization
112 16 having approved the establishment of a state assessment for
112 17 clean water to be transferred to the clean water fund. The
112 18 purpose of the commission is to finance methods to improve
112 19 surface water quality, including by reducing contributing
112 20 contaminant loads to receiving surface waters and reducing soil
112 21 erosion and sediment loss. The commission is responsible for
112 22 overseeing the water quality initiative as administered by the
112 23 division of soil conservation and water quality.
112 24    Moneys collected from the state assessment are to be
112 25 credited to the clean water fund which is under the supervision
112 26 of the commission.  The fund is composed of a general account,
112 27 an assessment account, and an expenditures account. The fund's
112 28 general account includes moneys appropriated by the general
112 29 assembly and other moneys available to and obtained or accepted
112 30 by the commission.  Moneys collected from the state assessment
112 31 are to be credited to the assessment account.  The bill also
112 32 includes an expenditures account which only includes moneys
112 33 transferred from the general account and the assessment account
112 34 for purposes of financing methods to improve surface water
112 35 quality.  Moneys transferred from the assessment account are
113  1 to be used to reimburse the department of agriculture and land
113  2 stewardship or a commodity organization for reasonable costs
113  3 of conducting a referendum to determine if a state assessment
113  4 for clean water is to be established, continued, or terminated.
113  5 The commission can also apply to the executive council for
113  6 moneys required to pay for reasonable costs of conducting a
113  7 referendum.  Moneys deposited into the expenditures account
113  8 may also be used to pay refunds to producers who have paid the
113  9 state assessment if the refund application has been approved
113 10 by the commodity organization.  The commission must review
113 11 the balance of moneys in the general account and the balance
113 12 of moneys in the assessment account, prior to the end of
113 13 each fiscal year.  If the total amount of moneys expected
113 14 to be credited to the general account during the following
113 15 fiscal year will not at least equal the balance of moneys in
113 16 the assessment account the commission must order that each
113 17 commodity organization that is imposing and collecting a state
113 18 assessment immediately suspend the imposition of that state
113 19 assessment for the following fiscal year.
113 20    The bill appropriates $40 million from the general fund
113 21 of the state to the clean water commission for the fiscal
113 22 year beginning July 1, 2017, and ending June 30, 2018, to
113 23 be credited to the general account of the clean water fund.
113 24 However, the amount of the appropriation is to be reduced by
113 25 any moneys credited to the fund's assessment account due to
113 26 state assessments collected on or before June 30, 2017.
113 27    The commission, in cooperation with the department of
113 28 agriculture and land stewardship, the department of natural
113 29 resources, and the Iowa finance authority, must submit a
113 30 report to the governor and general assembly by January 15,
113 31 2018, which includes a description of current clean water
113 32 programs and projects and a detailed plan for consolidating all
113 33 water quality and soil conservation initiatives and programs
113 34 and associated projects administered by the department of

112  8    The bill establishes a clean water commission housed in

112 12 four legislative members who serve in a nonvoting, ex officio
112 13 capacity, and persons appointed by the commodity organizations,
112 14 who also serve in a nonvoting, ex officio capacity.
112 15 Appointments are contingent on the commodity organization
112 16 having approved the establishment of a state assessment for
112 17 clean water to be transferred to the clean water fund. The
112 18 purpose of the commission is to finance methods to improve
112 19 surface water quality, including by reducing contributing
112 20 contaminant loads to receiving surface waters and reducing soil
112 21 erosion and sediment loss. The commission is responsible for
112 22 overseeing the water quality initiative as administered by the
112 23 division of soil conservation and water quality.
112 24    Moneys collected from the state assessment are to be
112 25 credited to the clean water fund which is under the supervision
112 26 of the commission.  The fund is composed of a general account,
112 27 an assessment account, and an expenditures account. The fund's
112 28 general account includes moneys appropriated by the general
112 29 assembly and other moneys available to and obtained or accepted
112 30 by the commission.  Moneys collected from the state assessment
112 31 are to be credited to the assessment account.  The bill also
112 32 includes an expenditures account which only includes moneys
112 33 transferred from the general account and the assessment account
112 34 for purposes of financing methods to improve surface water
112 35 quality.  Moneys transferred from the assessment account are
113  1 to be used to reimburse the department of agriculture and land
113  2 stewardship or a commodity organization for reasonable costs
113  3 of conducting a referendum to determine if a state assessment
113  4 for clean water is to be established, continued, or terminated.
113  5 The commission can also apply to the executive council for
113  6 moneys required to pay for reasonable costs of conducting a
113  7 referendum.  Moneys deposited into the expenditures account
113  8 may also be used to pay refunds to producers who have paid the
113  9 state assessment if the refund application has been approved
113 10 by the commodity organization.  The commission must review
113 11 the balance of moneys in the general account and the balance
113 12 of moneys in the assessment account, prior to the end of
113 13 each fiscal year.  If the total amount of moneys expected
113 14 to be credited to the general account during the following
113 15 fiscal year will not at least equal the balance of moneys in
113 16 the assessment account the commission must order that each
113 17 commodity organization that is imposing and collecting a state
113 18 assessment immediately suspend the imposition of that state
113 19 assessment for the following fiscal year.
113 20    The bill appropriates $40 million from the general fund
113 21 of the state to the clean water commission for the fiscal
113 22 year beginning July 1, 2017, and ending June 30, 2018, to
113 23 be credited to the general account of the clean water fund.
113 24 However, the amount of the appropriation is to be reduced by
113 25 any moneys credited to the fund's assessment account due to
113 26 state assessments collected on or before June 30, 2017.
113 27    The commission, in cooperation with the department of
113 28 agriculture and land stewardship, the department of natural
113 29 resources, and the Iowa finance authority, must submit a
113 30 report to the governor and general assembly by January 15,
113 31 2018, which includes a description of current clean water
113 32 programs and projects and a detailed plan for consolidating all
113 33 water quality and soil conservation initiatives and programs
113 34 and associated projects administered by the department of
113 35 agriculture and land stewardship, the department of natural
114  1 resources, and the Iowa finance authority under the overall

111 10 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
111 11 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
111 12    This bill relates to agricultural commodity organizations
111 13 representing producers of that commodity that are authorized
111 14 to impose an excise tax or "assessment" (and commonly
111 15 referred to as a "checkoff") on the commodity when first
111 16 sold by the producer to a first purchaser.  The goal of the
111 17 assessment is to fund promotional activities which involve
111 18 market development, research, and education.  The commodity
111 19 organizations include the Iowa dairy industry commission or
111 20 Iowa state dairy association (Code chapter 179), Iowa beef
111 21 cattle producers association (Code chapter 181), Iowa sheep and
111 22 wool promotion board (Code chapter 182), Iowa pork producers
111 23 council or Iowa pork producers association (Code chapter 183A),
111 24 Iowa egg council (Code chapter 184), the Iowa turkey marketing
111 25 council (Code chapter 184A), the Iowa soybean association
111 26 (Code chapter 185), and the Iowa corn promotion board (Code
111 27 chapter 185C).  The bill requires a commodity organization
111 28 to establish a separate state assessment for clean water, if
111 29 approved by a majority of its members at a referendum.  The
111 30 bill also requires commodity organizations to conduct a special
111 31 referendum to increase the rate of the assessment for clean
111 32 water. The rate of the state assessment is established by the
111 33 governing body of the commodity organization not to exceed the
111 34 assessment for direct use or national assessment or both. The
111 35 referendum would be conducted in the same manner as an initial
112  1 or special referendum conducted by the commodity organization
112  2 under its specific Code chapter.  The special assessment could
112  3 be continued or terminated in the same manner as the commodity
112  4 organization's assessment for promotional activities.  Moneys
112  5 from the state assessment would be collected by the commodity
112  6 organization and transferred to a newly created clean water
112  7 fund.
112  8    The bill establishes a clean water commission housed in
112  9 the division of soil conservation and water quality of the
112 10 department of agriculture and land stewardship.  The commission
112 11 is composed of nine voting members appointed by the governor,
112 12 four legislative members who serve in a nonvoting, ex officio
112 13 capacity, and persons appointed by the commodity organizations,
112 14 who also serve in a nonvoting, ex officio capacity.
112 15 Appointments are contingent on the commodity organization
112 16 having approved the establishment of a state assessment for
112 17 clean water to be transferred to the clean water fund. The
112 18 purpose of the commission is to finance methods to improve
112 19 surface water quality, including by reducing contributing

112 21 erosion and sediment loss. The commission is responsible for
112 22 overseeing the water quality initiative as administered by the

112 24    Moneys collected from the state assessment are to be
112 25 credited to the clean water fund which is under the supervision
112 26 of the commission.  The fund is composed of a general account,
112 27 an assessment account, and an expenditures account. The fund's
112 28 general account includes moneys appropriated by the general
112 29 assembly and other moneys available to and obtained or accepted
112 30 by the commission.  Moneys collected from the state assessment
112 31 are to be credited to the assessment account.  The bill also
112 32 includes an expenditures account which only includes moneys
112 33 transferred from the general account and the assessment account
112 34 for purposes of financing methods to improve surface water
112 35 quality.  Moneys transferred from the assessment account are
113  1 to be used to reimburse the department of agriculture and land
113  2 stewardship or a commodity organization for reasonable costs
113  3 of conducting a referendum to determine if a state assessment
113  4 for clean water is to be established, continued, or terminated.
113  5 The commission can also apply to the executive council for
113  6 moneys required to pay for reasonable costs of conducting a
113  7 referendum.  Moneys deposited into the expenditures account
113  8 may also be used to pay refunds to producers who have paid the
113  9 state assessment if the refund application has been approved
113 10 by the commodity organization.  The commission must review
113 11 the balance of moneys in the general account and the balance
113 12 of moneys in the assessment account, prior to the end of
113 13 each fiscal year.  If the total amount of moneys expected
113 14 to be credited to the general account during the following
113 15 fiscal year will not at least equal the balance of moneys in
113 16 the assessment account the commission must order that each
113 17 commodity organization that is imposing and collecting a state
113 18 assessment immediately suspend the imposition of that state
113 19 assessment for the following fiscal year.
113 20    The bill appropriates $40 million from the general fund
113 21 of the state to the clean water commission for the fiscal
113 22 year beginning July 1, 2017, and ending June 30, 2018, to

113 24 However, the amount of the appropriation is to be reduced by
113 25 any moneys credited to the fund's assessment account due to
113 26 state assessments collected on or before June 30, 2017.
113 27    The commission, in cooperation with the department of
113 28 agriculture and land stewardship, the department of natural
113 29 resources, and the Iowa finance authority, must submit a

111 21 cattle producers association (Code chapter 181), Iowa sheep and
111 22 wool promotion board (Code chapter 182), Iowa pork producers
111 23 council or Iowa pork producers association (Code chapter 183A),
111 24 Iowa egg council (Code chapter 184), the Iowa turkey marketing
111 25 council (Code chapter 184A), the Iowa soybean association
111 26 (Code chapter 185), and the Iowa corn promotion board (Code
111 27 chapter 185C).  The bill requires a commodity organization
111 28 to establish a separate state assessment for clean water, if
111 29 approved by a majority of its members at a referendum.  The
111 30 bill also requires commodity organizations to conduct a special
111 31 referendum to increase the rate of the assessment for clean
111 32 water. The rate of the state assessment is established by the
111 33 governing body of the commodity organization not to exceed the
111 34 assessment for direct use or national assessment or both. The
111 35 referendum would be conducted in the same manner as an initial
112  1 or special referendum conducted by the commodity organization
112  2 under its specific Code chapter.  The special assessment could
112  3 be continued or terminated in the same manner as the commodity
112  4 organization's assessment for promotional activities.  Moneys
112  5 from the state assessment would be collected by the commodity
112  6 organization and transferred to a newly created clean water
112  7 fund.
112  8    The bill establishes a clean water commission housed in
112  9 the division of soil conservation and water quality of the
112 10 department of agriculture and land stewardship.  The commission
112 11 is composed of nine voting members appointed by the governor,
112 12 four legislative members who serve in a nonvoting, ex officio
112 13 capacity, and persons appointed by the commodity organizations,
112 14 who also serve in a nonvoting, ex officio capacity.
112 15 Appointments are contingent on the commodity organization
112 16 having approved the establishment of a state assessment for
112 17 clean water to be transferred to the clean water fund. The
112 18 purpose of the commission is to finance methods to improve
112 19 surface water quality, including by reducing contributing
112 20 contaminant loads to receiving surface waters and reducing soil
112 21 erosion and sediment loss. The commission is responsible for
112 22 overseeing the water quality initiative as administered by the
112 23 division of soil conservation and water quality.
112 24    Moneys collected from the state assessment are to be
112 25 credited to the clean water fund which is under the supervision
112 26 of the commission.  The fund is composed of a general account,
112 27 an assessment account, and an expenditures account. The fund's
112 28 general account includes moneys appropriated by the general
112 29 assembly and other moneys available to and obtained or accepted
112 30 by the commission.  Moneys collected from the state assessment
112 31 are to be credited to the assessment account.  The bill also
112 32 includes an expenditures account which only includes moneys
112 33 transferred from the general account and the assessment account
112 34 for purposes of financing methods to improve surface water
112 35 quality.  Moneys transferred from the assessment account are
113  1 to be used to reimburse the department of agriculture and land
113  2 stewardship or a commodity organization for reasonable costs
113  3 of conducting a referendum to determine if a state assessment
113  4 for clean water is to be established, continued, or terminated.
113  5 The commission can also apply to the executive council for
113  6 moneys required to pay for reasonable costs of conducting a
113  7 referendum.  Moneys deposited into the expenditures account
113  8 may also be used to pay refunds to producers who have paid the
113  9 state assessment if the refund application has been approved
113 10 by the commodity organization.  The commission must review
113 11 the balance of moneys in the general account and the balance
113 12 of moneys in the assessment account, prior to the end of
113 13 each fiscal year.  If the total amount of moneys expected
113 14 to be credited to the general account during the following
113 15 fiscal year will not at least equal the balance of moneys in
113 16 the assessment account the commission must order that each
113 17 commodity organization that is imposing and collecting a state
113 18 assessment immediately suspend the imposition of that state
113 19 assessment for the following fiscal year.
113 20    The bill appropriates $40 million from the general fund
113 21 of the state to the clean water commission for the fiscal
113 22 year beginning July 1, 2017, and ending June 30, 2018, to
113 23 be credited to the general account of the clean water fund.
113 24 However, the amount of the appropriation is to be reduced by
113 25 any moneys credited to the fund's assessment account due to
113 26 state assessments collected on or before June 30, 2017.
113 27    The commission, in cooperation with the department of
113 28 agriculture and land stewardship, the department of natural
113 29 resources, and the Iowa finance authority, must submit a
113 30 report to the governor and general assembly by January 15,
113 31 2018, which includes a description of current clean water
113 32 programs and projects and a detailed plan for consolidating all
113 33 water quality and soil conservation initiatives and programs
113 34 and associated projects administered by the department of
113 35 agriculture and land stewardship, the department of natural

111 15 referred to as a "checkoff") on the commodity when first
111 16 sold by the producer to a first purchaser.  The goal of the
111 17 assessment is to fund promotional activities which involve
111 18 market development, research, and education.  The commodity
111 19 organizations include the Iowa dairy industry commission or
111 20 Iowa state dairy association (Code chapter 179), Iowa beef
111 21 cattle producers association (Code chapter 181), Iowa sheep and
111 22 wool promotion board (Code chapter 182), Iowa pork producers
111 23 council or Iowa pork producers association (Code chapter 183A),
111 24 Iowa egg council (Code chapter 184), the Iowa turkey marketing
111 25 council (Code chapter 184A), the Iowa soybean association
111 26 (Code chapter 185), and the Iowa corn promotion board (Code
111 27 chapter 185C).  The bill requires a commodity organization
111 28 to establish a separate state assessment for clean water, if
111 29 approved by a majority of its members at a referendum.  The
111 30 bill also requires commodity organizations to conduct a special
111 31 referendum to increase the rate of the assessment for clean
111 32 water. The rate of the state assessment is established by the
111 33 governing body of the commodity organization not to exceed the
111 34 assessment for direct use or national assessment or both. The
111 35 referendum would be conducted in the same manner as an initial
112  1 or special referendum conducted by the commodity organization
112  2 under its specific Code chapter.  The special assessment could
112  3 be continued or terminated in the same manner as the commodity
112  4 organization's assessment for promotional activities.  Moneys
112  5 from the state assessment would be collected by the commodity
112  6 organization and transferred to a newly created clean water
112  7 fund.
112  8    The bill establishes a clean water commission housed in
112  9 the division of soil conservation and water quality of the
112 10 department of agriculture and land stewardship.  The commission
112 11 is composed of nine voting members appointed by the governor,
112 12 four legislative members who serve in a nonvoting, ex officio
112 13 capacity, and persons appointed by the commodity organizations,
112 14 who also serve in a nonvoting, ex officio capacity.
112 15 Appointments are contingent on the commodity organization
112 16 having approved the establishment of a state assessment for
112 17 clean water to be transferred to the clean water fund. The
112 18 purpose of the commission is to finance methods to improve
112 19 surface water quality, including by reducing contributing
112 20 contaminant loads to receiving surface waters and reducing soil
112 21 erosion and sediment loss. The commission is responsible for
112 22 overseeing the water quality initiative as administered by the
112 23 division of soil conservation and water quality.
112 24    Moneys collected from the state assessment are to be
112 25 credited to the clean water fund which is under the supervision
112 26 of the commission.  The fund is composed of a general account,
112 27 an assessment account, and an expenditures account. The fund's
112 28 general account includes moneys appropriated by the general
112 29 assembly and other moneys available to and obtained or accepted
112 30 by the commission.  Moneys collected from the state assessment
112 31 are to be credited to the assessment account.  The bill also
112 32 includes an expenditures account which only includes moneys
112 33 transferred from the general account and the assessment account
112 34 for purposes of financing methods to improve surface water
112 35 quality.  Moneys transferred from the assessment account are
113  1 to be used to reimburse the department of agriculture and land
113  2 stewardship or a commodity organization for reasonable costs
113  3 of conducting a referendum to determine if a state assessment
113  4 for clean water is to be established, continued, or terminated.
113  5 The commission can also apply to the executive council for
113  6 moneys required to pay for reasonable costs of conducting a
113  7 referendum.  Moneys deposited into the expenditures account
113  8 may also be used to pay refunds to producers who have paid the
113  9 state assessment if the refund application has been approved
113 10 by the commodity organization.  The commission must review
113 11 the balance of moneys in the general account and the balance
113 12 of moneys in the assessment account, prior to the end of
113 13 each fiscal year.  If the total amount of moneys expected
113 14 to be credited to the general account during the following
113 15 fiscal year will not at least equal the balance of moneys in
113 16 the assessment account the commission must order that each
113 17 commodity organization that is imposing and collecting a state
113 18 assessment immediately suspend the imposition of that state
113 19 assessment for the following fiscal year.
113 20    The bill appropriates $40 million from the general fund
113 21 of the state to the clean water commission for the fiscal
113 22 year beginning July 1, 2017, and ending June 30, 2018, to
113 23 be credited to the general account of the clean water fund.
113 24 However, the amount of the appropriation is to be reduced by
113 25 any moneys credited to the fund's assessment account due to
113 26 state assessments collected on or before June 30, 2017.
113 27    The commission, in cooperation with the department of
113 28 agriculture and land stewardship, the department of natural
113 29 resources, and the Iowa finance authority, must submit a
113 30 report to the governor and general assembly by January 15,
113 31 2018, which includes a description of current clean water
113 32 programs and projects and a detailed plan for consolidating all
113 33 water quality and soil conservation initiatives and programs
113 34 and associated projects administered by the department of
113 35 agriculture and land stewardship, the department of natural
114  1 resources, and the Iowa finance authority under the overall
114  2 supervision of the commission.

111 26 (Code chapter 185), and the Iowa corn promotion board (Code
111 27 chapter 185C).  The bill requires a commodity organization
111 28 to establish a separate state assessment for clean water, if
111 29 approved by a majority of its members at a referendum.  The
111 30 bill also requires commodity organizations to conduct a special
111 31 referendum to increase the rate of the assessment for clean
111 32 water. The rate of the state assessment is established by the
111 33 governing body of the commodity organization not to exceed the
111 34 assessment for direct use or national assessment or both. The
111 35 referendum would be conducted in the same manner as an initial
112  1 or special referendum conducted by the commodity organization
112  2 under its specific Code chapter.  The special assessment could
112  3 be continued or terminated in the same manner as the commodity
112  4 organization's assessment for promotional activities.  Moneys
112  5 from the state assessment would be collected by the commodity
112  6 organization and transferred to a newly created clean water
112  7 fund.
112  8    The bill establishes a clean water commission housed in
112  9 the division of soil conservation and water quality of the
112 10 department of agriculture and land stewardship.  The commission
112 11 is composed of nine voting members appointed by the governor,
112 12 four legislative members who serve in a nonvoting, ex officio
112 13 capacity, and persons appointed by the commodity organizations,
112 14 who also serve in a nonvoting, ex officio capacity.
112 15 Appointments are contingent on the commodity organization
112 16 having approved the establishment of a state assessment for
112 17 clean water to be transferred to the clean water fund. The
112 18 purpose of the commission is to finance methods to improve
112 19 surface water quality, including by reducing contributing
112 20 contaminant loads to receiving surface waters and reducing soil
112 21 erosion and sediment loss. The commission is responsible for
112 22 overseeing the water quality initiative as administered by the
112 23 division of soil conservation and water quality.
112 24    Moneys collected from the state assessment are to be
112 25 credited to the clean water fund which is under the supervision
112 26 of the commission.  The fund is composed of a general account,
112 27 an assessment account, and an expenditures account. The fund's
112 28 general account includes moneys appropriated by the general
112 29 assembly and other moneys available to and obtained or accepted
112 30 by the commission.  Moneys collected from the state assessment
112 31 are to be credited to the assessment account.  The bill also
112 32 includes an expenditures account which only includes moneys
112 33 transferred from the general account and the assessment account
112 34 for purposes of financing methods to improve surface water
112 35 quality.  Moneys transferred from the assessment account are
113  1 to be used to reimburse the department of agriculture and land
113  2 stewardship or a commodity organization for reasonable costs
113  3 of conducting a referendum to determine if a state assessment
113  4 for clean water is to be established, continued, or terminated.
113  5 The commission can also apply to the executive council for
113  6 moneys required to pay for reasonable costs of conducting a
113  7 referendum.  Moneys deposited into the expenditures account
113  8 may also be used to pay refunds to producers who have paid the
113  9 state assessment if the refund application has been approved
113 10 by the commodity organization.  The commission must review
113 11 the balance of moneys in the general account and the balance
113 12 of moneys in the assessment account, prior to the end of
113 13 each fiscal year.  If the total amount of moneys expected
113 14 to be credited to the general account during the following
113 15 fiscal year will not at least equal the balance of moneys in
113 16 the assessment account the commission must order that each
113 17 commodity organization that is imposing and collecting a state
113 18 assessment immediately suspend the imposition of that state
113 19 assessment for the following fiscal year.
113 20    The bill appropriates $40 million from the general fund
113 21 of the state to the clean water commission for the fiscal
113 22 year beginning July 1, 2017, and ending June 30, 2018, to
113 23 be credited to the general account of the clean water fund.
113 24 However, the amount of the appropriation is to be reduced by
113 25 any moneys credited to the fund's assessment account due to
113 26 state assessments collected on or before June 30, 2017.
113 27    The commission, in cooperation with the department of
113 28 agriculture and land stewardship, the department of natural
113 29 resources, and the Iowa finance authority, must submit a
113 30 report to the governor and general assembly by January 15,
113 31 2018, which includes a description of current clean water
113 32 programs and projects and a detailed plan for consolidating all
113 33 water quality and soil conservation initiatives and programs
113 34 and associated projects administered by the department of
113 35 agriculture and land stewardship, the department of natural

112 19 surface water quality, including by reducing contributing
112 20 contaminant loads to receiving surface waters and reducing soil
112 21 erosion and sediment loss. The commission is responsible for
112 22 overseeing the water quality initiative as administered by the

112 24    Moneys collected from the state assessment are to be
112 25 credited to the clean water fund which is under the supervision
112 26 of the commission.  The fund is composed of a general account,
112 27 an assessment account, and an expenditures account. The fund's
112 28 general account includes moneys appropriated by the general
112 29 assembly and other moneys available to and obtained or accepted
112 30 by the commission.  Moneys collected from the state assessment
112 31 are to be credited to the assessment account.  The bill also
112 32 includes an expenditures account which only includes moneys
112 33 transferred from the general account and the assessment account
112 34 for purposes of financing methods to improve surface water
112 35 quality.  Moneys transferred from the assessment account are
113  1 to be used to reimburse the department of agriculture and land
113  2 stewardship or a commodity organization for reasonable costs
113  3 of conducting a referendum to determine if a state assessment
113  4 for clean water is to be established, continued, or terminated.
113  5 The commission can also apply to the executive council for
113  6 moneys required to pay for reasonable costs of conducting a
113  7 referendum.  Moneys deposited into the expenditures account
113  8 may also be used to pay refunds to producers who have paid the
113  9 state assessment if the refund application has been approved
113 10 by the commodity organization.  The commission must review
113 11 the balance of moneys in the general account and the balance
113 12 of moneys in the assessment account, prior to the end of
113 13 each fiscal year.  If the total amount of moneys expected
113 14 to be credited to the general account during the following
113 15 fiscal year will not at least equal the balance of moneys in
113 16 the assessment account the commission must order that each
113 17 commodity organization that is imposing and collecting a state
113 18 assessment immediately suspend the imposition of that state
113 19 assessment for the following fiscal year.
113 20    The bill appropriates $40 million from the general fund
113 21 of the state to the clean water commission for the fiscal
113 22 year beginning July 1, 2017, and ending June 30, 2018, to
113 23 be credited to the general account of the clean water fund.
113 24 However, the amount of the appropriation is to be reduced by
113 25 any moneys credited to the fund's assessment account due to
113 26 state assessments collected on or before June 30, 2017.
113 27    The commission, in cooperation with the department of
113 28 agriculture and land stewardship, the department of natural
113 29 resources, and the Iowa finance authority, must submit a
113 30 report to the governor and general assembly by January 15,
113 31 2018, which includes a description of current clean water
113 32 programs and projects and a detailed plan for consolidating all
113 33 water quality and soil conservation initiatives and programs
113 34 and associated projects administered by the department of

111 25 council (Code chapter 184A), the Iowa soybean association
111 26 (Code chapter 185), and the Iowa corn promotion board (Code
111 27 chapter 185C).  The bill requires a commodity organization
111 28 to establish a separate state assessment for clean water, if
111 29 approved by a majority of its members at a referendum.  The
111 30 bill also requires commodity organizations to conduct a special
111 31 referendum to increase the rate of the assessment for clean
111 32 water. The rate of the state assessment is established by the
111 33 governing body of the commodity organization not to exceed the
111 34 assessment for direct use or national assessment or both. The
111 35 referendum would be conducted in the same manner as an initial
112  1 or special referendum conducted by the commodity organization
112  2 under its specific Code chapter.  The special assessment could
112  3 be continued or terminated in the same manner as the commodity
112  4 organization's assessment for promotional activities.  Moneys
112  5 from the state assessment would be collected by the commodity
112  6 organization and transferred to a newly created clean water
112  7 fund.
112  8    The bill establishes a clean water commission housed in
112  9 the division of soil conservation and water quality of the
112 10 department of agriculture and land stewardship.  The commission
112 11 is composed of nine voting members appointed by the governor,
112 12 four legislative members who serve in a nonvoting, ex officio
112 13 capacity, and persons appointed by the commodity organizations,
112 14 who also serve in a nonvoting, ex officio capacity.
112 15 Appointments are contingent on the commodity organization
112 16 having approved the establishment of a state assessment for
112 17 clean water to be transferred to the clean water fund. The
112 18 purpose of the commission is to finance methods to improve
112 19 surface water quality, including by reducing contributing
112 20 contaminant loads to receiving surface waters and reducing soil
112 21 erosion and sediment loss. The commission is responsible for
112 22 overseeing the water quality initiative as administered by the
112 23 division of soil conservation and water quality.
112 24    Moneys collected from the state assessment are to be
112 25 credited to the clean water fund which is under the supervision
112 26 of the commission.  The fund is composed of a general account,
112 27 an assessment account, and an expenditures account. The fund's
112 28 general account includes moneys appropriated by the general
112 29 assembly and other moneys available to and obtained or accepted
112 30 by the commission.  Moneys collected from the state assessment
112 31 are to be credited to the assessment account.  The bill also
112 32 includes an expenditures account which only includes moneys
112 33 transferred from the general account and the assessment account
112 34 for purposes of financing methods to improve surface water
112 35 quality.  Moneys transferred from the assessment account are
113  1 to be used to reimburse the department of agriculture and land
113  2 stewardship or a commodity organization for reasonable costs
113  3 of conducting a referendum to determine if a state assessment
113  4 for clean water is to be established, continued, or terminated.
113  5 The commission can also apply to the executive council for
113  6 moneys required to pay for reasonable costs of conducting a
113  7 referendum.  Moneys deposited into the expenditures account
113  8 may also be used to pay refunds to producers who have paid the
113  9 state assessment if the refund application has been approved
113 10 by the commodity organization.  The commission must review
113 11 the balance of moneys in the general account and the balance
113 12 of moneys in the assessment account, prior to the end of
113 13 each fiscal year.  If the total amount of moneys expected
113 14 to be credited to the general account during the following
113 15 fiscal year will not at least equal the balance of moneys in
113 16 the assessment account the commission must order that each
113 17 commodity organization that is imposing and collecting a state
113 18 assessment immediately suspend the imposition of that state
113 19 assessment for the following fiscal year.
113 20    The bill appropriates $40 million from the general fund
113 21 of the state to the clean water commission for the fiscal
113 22 year beginning July 1, 2017, and ending June 30, 2018, to
113 23 be credited to the general account of the clean water fund.
113 24 However, the amount of the appropriation is to be reduced by
113 25 any moneys credited to the fund's assessment account due to
113 26 state assessments collected on or before June 30, 2017.
113 27    The commission, in cooperation with the department of
113 28 agriculture and land stewardship, the department of natural

111 30 bill also requires commodity organizations to conduct a special
111 31 referendum to increase the rate of the assessment for clean
111 32 water. The rate of the state assessment is established by the
111 33 governing body of the commodity organization not to exceed the

112  6 organization and transferred to a newly created clean water
112  7 fund.
112  8    The bill establishes a clean water commission housed in
112  9 the division of soil conservation and water quality of the
112 10 department of agriculture and land stewardship.  The commission
112 11 is composed of nine voting members appointed by the governor,
112 12 four legislative members who serve in a nonvoting, ex officio
112 13 capacity, and persons appointed by the commodity organizations,
112 14 who also serve in a nonvoting, ex officio capacity.
112 15 Appointments are contingent on the commodity organization
112 16 having approved the establishment of a state assessment for
112 17 clean water to be transferred to the clean water fund. The
112 18 purpose of the commission is to finance methods to improve
112 19 surface water quality, including by reducing contributing
112 20 contaminant loads to receiving surface waters and reducing soil
112 21 erosion and sediment loss. The commission is responsible for
112 22 overseeing the water quality initiative as administered by the
112 23 division of soil conservation and water quality.
112 24    Moneys collected from the state assessment are to be
112 25 credited to the clean water fund which is under the supervision
112 26 of the commission.  The fund is composed of a general account,
112 27 an assessment account, and an expenditures account. The fund's
112 28 general account includes moneys appropriated by the general
112 29 assembly and other moneys available to and obtained or accepted
112 30 by the commission.  Moneys collected from the state assessment
112 31 are to be credited to the assessment account.  The bill also
112 32 includes an expenditures account which only includes moneys
112 33 transferred from the general account and the assessment account
112 34 for purposes of financing methods to improve surface water
112 35 quality.  Moneys transferred from the assessment account are
113  1 to be used to reimburse the department of agriculture and land
113  2 stewardship or a commodity organization for reasonable costs
113  3 of conducting a referendum to determine if a state assessment
113  4 for clean water is to be established, continued, or terminated.
113  5 The commission can also apply to the executive council for
113  6 moneys required to pay for reasonable costs of conducting a
113  7 referendum.  Moneys deposited into the expenditures account
113  8 may also be used to pay refunds to producers who have paid the
113  9 state assessment if the refund application has been approved
113 10 by the commodity organization.  The commission must review
113 11 the balance of moneys in the general account and the balance
113 12 of moneys in the assessment account, prior to the end of
113 13 each fiscal year.  If the total amount of moneys expected
113 14 to be credited to the general account during the following
113 15 fiscal year will not at least equal the balance of moneys in
113 16 the assessment account the commission must order that each

113 19 assessment for the following fiscal year.

113 23 be credited to the general account of the clean water fund.
113 24 However, the amount of the appropriation is to be reduced by
113 25 any moneys credited to the fund's assessment account due to
113 26 state assessments collected on or before June 30, 2017.

112  8    The bill establishes a clean water commission housed in
112  9 the division of soil conservation and water quality of the
112 10 department of agriculture and land stewardship.  The commission
112 11 is composed of nine voting members appointed by the governor,
112 12 four legislative members who serve in a nonvoting, ex officio
112 13 capacity, and persons appointed by the commodity organizations,
112 14 who also serve in a nonvoting, ex officio capacity.
112 15 Appointments are contingent on the commodity organization
112 16 having approved the establishment of a state assessment for
112 17 clean water to be transferred to the clean water fund. The
112 18 purpose of the commission is to finance methods to improve
112 19 surface water quality, including by reducing contributing
112 20 contaminant loads to receiving surface waters and reducing soil
112 21 erosion and sediment loss. The commission is responsible for
112 22 overseeing the water quality initiative as administered by the
112 23 division of soil conservation and water quality.
112 24    Moneys collected from the state assessment are to be
112 25 credited to the clean water fund which is under the supervision
112 26 of the commission.  The fund is composed of a general account,
112 27 an assessment account, and an expenditures account. The fund's
112 28 general account includes moneys appropriated by the general
112 29 assembly and other moneys available to and obtained or accepted
112 30 by the commission.  Moneys collected from the state assessment
112 31 are to be credited to the assessment account.  The bill also
112 32 includes an expenditures account which only includes moneys
112 33 transferred from the general account and the assessment account
112 34 for purposes of financing methods to improve surface water
112 35 quality.  Moneys transferred from the assessment account are
113  1 to be used to reimburse the department of agriculture and land
113  2 stewardship or a commodity organization for reasonable costs
113  3 of conducting a referendum to determine if a state assessment
113  4 for clean water is to be established, continued, or terminated.
113  5 The commission can also apply to the executive council for
113  6 moneys required to pay for reasonable costs of conducting a
113  7 referendum.  Moneys deposited into the expenditures account
113  8 may also be used to pay refunds to producers who have paid the
113  9 state assessment if the refund application has been approved
113 10 by the commodity organization.  The commission must review
113 11 the balance of moneys in the general account and the balance
113 12 of moneys in the assessment account, prior to the end of
113 13 each fiscal year.  If the total amount of moneys expected
113 14 to be credited to the general account during the following
113 15 fiscal year will not at least equal the balance of moneys in
113 16 the assessment account the commission must order that each
113 17 commodity organization that is imposing and collecting a state
113 18 assessment immediately suspend the imposition of that state
113 19 assessment for the following fiscal year.
113 20    The bill appropriates $40 million from the general fund
113 21 of the state to the clean water commission for the fiscal
113 22 year beginning July 1, 2017, and ending June 30, 2018, to
113 23 be credited to the general account of the clean water fund.
113 24 However, the amount of the appropriation is to be reduced by
113 25 any moneys credited to the fund's assessment account due to
113 26 state assessments collected on or before June 30, 2017.
113 27    The commission, in cooperation with the department of
113 28 agriculture and land stewardship, the department of natural
113 29 resources, and the Iowa finance authority, must submit a
113 30 report to the governor and general assembly by January 15,
