The

transfer

The

determine
28


a

The
statewide

The

and
shall
not
affect
the
receipt
or
amount
of
22


a
budget
adjustment
received
under
Code
section
257.14.
The
23


bill
also
requires
district
equity
supplement
amounts
received
24


by
a
school
district
to
be
excluded
from
collective
bargaining
25


and
requires
such

to
be
used
solely

and
to
supplement,
not
27


supplant,
