  5 34 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  5 35 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  6  1 This bill relates to the choice of a physician to treat an
  6  2 injured employee under the state's workers' compensation laws.
  6  3 The bill allows the employer to choose care unless the employee
  6  4 has predesignated a physician as provided in the bill.
  6  5    The bill gives an employee the right to predesignate a
  6  6 physician who is a primary care provider, who has previously
  6  7 provided treatment to the employee and has retained the
  6  8 employee's medical records, to provide treatment for a
  6  9 work=related injury.  The employer is required to provide
  6 10 written notice to employees of this right upon hire, and
  6 11 periodically during employment, and upon receiving notice of
  6 12 an injury from an employee who has not yet predesignated a
  6 13 physician of their right to do so, in a manner prescribed by
  6 14 the workers' compensation commissioner.  An employer or an
  6 15 employer's insurer shall not coerce or otherwise attempt to
  6 16 influence an injured employee's choice of a physician.
  6 17    If the employer fails to provide such notification, an
  6 18 injured employee has the right to choose any physician to
  6 19 provide treatment for the work=related injury and that
  6 20 treatment shall be considered authorized care.
  6 21    If the employer or employee is dissatisfied with the care
  6 22 chosen by the other party, the dissatisfied party is required
  6 23 to communicate the basis of dissatisfaction to the other
  6 24 party in writing and the parties may agree to alternate care
  6 25 reasonably suited to treat the injury.  If the parties cannot
  6 26 agree to such alternate care, the dissatisfied party may make
  6 27 an application for alternate care to the commissioner.
  6 28    An application for alternate care is an original proceeding
  6 29 and is treated as a contested case.  A party may request that
  6 30 the hearing be held in person, by telephone, or by audio=video
  6 31 conference.  The commissioner is required to issue a decision
  6 32 within 10 working days of receipt of an application made
  6 33 pursuant to a telephone hearing or audio=video conference
  6 34 hearing and within 14 days of an in=person hearing.
  6 35    Code section 85.39 is amended to provide that if the
  7  1 employee has chosen care, when it is medically indicated that
  7  2 no significant improvement from an injury is anticipated, the
  7  3 employee may obtain a medical opinion regarding the extent
  7  4 of the employee's permanent disability from the employee's
  7  5 physician.  If the employer believes that the evaluation of
  7  6 permanent disability obtained by the employee is too high, the
  7  7 employer has the right to obtain another medical opinion from a
  7  8 physician of the employer's choosing.
