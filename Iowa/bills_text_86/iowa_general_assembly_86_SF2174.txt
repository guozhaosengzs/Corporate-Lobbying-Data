  4  4                           EXPLANATION
  4  5 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  4  6 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  4  7    This bill relates to access to and retention of peace officer
  4  8 body camera data.
  4  9    The bill defines "body camera" to mean an electronic device
  4 10 that is capable of recording video and audio data or capable of
  4 11 transmitting video or audio data to be recorded remotely, and
  4 12 is worn on the person of a peace officer.
  4 13    The bill defines "peace officer" to mean a peace officer
  4 14 defined in Code section 801.4(11)(a), (b), (c), (f), (g), (h),
  4 15 or (i), which excludes a parole or probation officer.
  4 16    The bill does not require a law enforcement agency or peace
  4 17 officers to use body cameras. However, if a law enforcement
  4 18 agency uses body cameras, the bill sets out a process to retain
  4 19 the body camera data and to  provide access to the data.
  4 20    The bill provides as a general rule that a law enforcement
  4 21 agency that employs a peace officer whose body camera records
  4 22 body camera data shall retain the data for six months from the
  4 23 date it was recorded, after such time the body camera data
  4 24 shall be permanently deleted.
  4 25    The bill requires that body camera data shall be
  4 26 automatically retained for at least two years from the date
  4 27 of the recording under the following circumstances: the data
  4 28 involves any use of force; the data involves events leading
  4 29 up to and including an arrest or detention of a person; the
  4 30 data involves an encounter about which a formal or informal
  4 31 complaint has been registered; the peace officer whose body
  4 32 camera recorded the data voluntarily requests retention if
  4 33 that officer reasonably asserts the data has evidentiary or
  4 34 exculpatory value; a peace officer, who is a subject of the
  4 35 data recorded by another peace officer's body camera, and who
  5  1 voluntarily requests retention, if that officer reasonably
  5  2 asserts that the data has evidentiary or exculpatory value;
  5  3 a superior peace officer who requests retention of data if
  5  4 that superior peace officer reasonably asserts that the data
  5  5 has evidentiary or exculpatory value; a peace officer who
  5  6 voluntarily requests retention if the data is being retained
  5  7 solely and exclusively for law enforcement training purposes;
  5  8 a member of the public who is a subject of the data who
  5  9 voluntarily requests retention; a parent or legal guardian of
  5 10 a minor who is a subject of the data who voluntarily requests
  5 11 retention; or a deceased person's immediate family member or
  5 12 legally authorized designee who voluntarily requests retention.
  5 13    The bill specifies that body camera data involving any use of
  5 14 force by a peace officer shall be a public record and shall not
  5 15 be exempt from public examination.
  5 16    The bill provides that the following persons may examine,
  5 17 obtain a copy of, and disseminate body camera data: a person
  5 18 who is a subject of the data or the person's attorney; a parent
  5 19 or legal guardian of a person who is a minor who is a subject
  5 20 of the data, or the attorney for the parent or legal guardian;
  5 21 the immediate family member or legally authorized designee of a
  5 22 deceased person who is a subject of the data, or the attorney
  5 23 for the immediate family member or legally authorized designee;
  5 24 any other person seeking data, if the person who is a subject
  5 25 of the data, or the attorney for the person who is a subject of
  5 26 the data, has given written authority to the law enforcement
  5 27 agency to disclose the data to that other person, unless the
  5 28 subject of the data is a minor; any other person seeking data,
  5 29 if the parent or legal guardian of a minor who is a subject of
  5 30 the data, or the attorney for the parent or legal guardian,
  5 31 has given written authority to the law enforcement agency to
  5 32 disclose the data to that other person; or any other person
  5 33 seeking data of a deceased person who is a subject of the data,
  5 34 if the immediate family member or legally authorized designee
  5 35 of the deceased person, or the attorney for the immediate
  6  1 family member or legally authorized designee, has given written
  6  2 authority to the law enforcement agency to disclose the data to
  6  3 that other person.
  6  4    The bill prohibits a peace officer from reviewing or
  6  5 receiving an accounting of any body camera data that involves
  6  6 any use of force and is subject to a minimum two=year retention
  6  7 period under the bill, prior to completing any required initial
  6  8 reports, statements, and interviews regarding the recorded
  6  9 event.
  6 10    The bill prohibits a law enforcement agency from using or
  6 11 divulging body camera data for commercial or other non=law
  6 12 enforcement purposes.
  6 13    The bill allows a law enforcement agency to authorize a third
  6 14 party to act as its agent in maintaining body camera data,
  6 15 provided that the agent shall not be permitted to independently
  6 16 examine or alter any data, except to delete data as required by
  6 17 law or agency retention policies.
  6 18    The bill specifies that any member of the public who
  6 19 is a subject of the body camera data, the parent or legal
  6 20 guardian of a minor who is a subject of body camera data, or a
  6 21 deceased person's immediate family member or legally authorized
  6 22 designee, shall be permitted to review that specific body
  6 23 camera data in order to make a determination as to whether to
  6 24 voluntarily request that the body camera data be subject to a
  6 25 two=year retention period under the bill.
  6 26    The bill may include a state mandate as defined in Code
  6 27 section 25B.3.  The bill makes inapplicable Code section 25B.2,
  6 28 subsection 3, which would relieve a political subdivision from
  6 29 complying with a state mandate if funding for the cost of
  6 30 the state mandate is not provided or specified.  Therefore,
  6 31 political subdivisions are required to comply with any state
  6 32 mandate included in the bill.

  4  4                           EXPLANATION
  4  5 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  4  6 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  4  7    This bill relates to access to and retention of peace officer
  4  8 body camera data.
  4  9    The bill defines "body camera" to mean an electronic device
  4 10 that is capable of recording video and audio data or capable of
  4 11 transmitting video or audio data to be recorded remotely, and
  4 12 is worn on the person of a peace officer.
  4 13    The bill defines "peace officer" to mean a peace officer
  4 14 defined in Code section 801.4(11)(a), (b), (c), (f), (g), (h),
  4 15 or (i), which excludes a parole or probation officer.
  4 16    The bill does not require a law enforcement agency or peace
  4 17 officers to use body cameras. However, if a law enforcement
  4 18 agency uses body cameras, the bill sets out a process to retain
  4 19 the body camera data and to  provide access to the data.
  4 20    The bill provides as a general rule that a law enforcement
  4 21 agency that employs a peace officer whose body camera records
  4 22 body camera data shall retain the data for six months from the
  4 23 date it was recorded, after such time the body camera data
  4 24 shall be permanently deleted.
  4 25    The bill requires that body camera data shall be
  4 26 automatically retained for at least two years from the date
  4 27 of the recording under the following circumstances: the data
  4 28 involves any use of force; the data involves events leading
  4 29 up to and including an arrest or detention of a person; the
  4 30 data involves an encounter about which a formal or informal
  4 31 complaint has been registered; the peace officer whose body
  4 32 camera recorded the data voluntarily requests retention if
  4 33 that officer reasonably asserts the data has evidentiary or
  4 34 exculpatory value; a peace officer, who is a subject of the
  4 35 data recorded by another peace officer's body camera, and who
  5  1 voluntarily requests retention, if that officer reasonably
  5  2 asserts that the data has evidentiary or exculpatory value;
  5  3 a superior peace officer who requests retention of data if
  5  4 that superior peace officer reasonably asserts that the data
  5  5 has evidentiary or exculpatory value; a peace officer who
  5  6 voluntarily requests retention if the data is being retained
  5  7 solely and exclusively for law enforcement training purposes;
  5  8 a member of the public who is a subject of the data who
  5  9 voluntarily requests retention; a parent or legal guardian of
  5 10 a minor who is a subject of the data who voluntarily requests
  5 11 retention; or a deceased person's immediate family member or
  5 12 legally authorized designee who voluntarily requests retention.
  5 13    The bill specifies that body camera data involving any use of
  5 14 force by a peace officer shall be a public record and shall not
  5 15 be exempt from public examination.
  5 16    The bill provides that the following persons may examine,
  5 17 obtain a copy of, and disseminate body camera data: a person
  5 18 who is a subject of the data or the person's attorney; a parent
  5 19 or legal guardian of a person who is a minor who is a subject
  5 20 of the data, or the attorney for the parent or legal guardian;
  5 21 the immediate family member or legally authorized designee of a
  5 22 deceased person who is a subject of the data, or the attorney
  5 23 for the immediate family member or legally authorized designee;
  5 24 any other person seeking data, if the person who is a subject
  5 25 of the data, or the attorney for the person who is a subject of
  5 26 the data, has given written authority to the law enforcement
  5 27 agency to disclose the data to that other person, unless the
  5 28 subject of the data is a minor; any other person seeking data,
  5 29 if the parent or legal guardian of a minor who is a subject of
  5 30 the data, or the attorney for the parent or legal guardian,
  5 31 has given written authority to the law enforcement agency to
  5 32 disclose the data to that other person; or any other person
  5 33 seeking data of a deceased person who is a subject of the data,
  5 34 if the immediate family member or legally authorized designee
  5 35 of the deceased person, or the attorney for the immediate
  6  1 family member or legally authorized designee, has given written
  6  2 authority to the law enforcement agency to disclose the data to
  6  3 that other person.
  6  4    The bill prohibits a peace officer from reviewing or
  6  5 receiving an accounting of any body camera data that involves
  6  6 any use of force and is subject to a minimum two=year retention
  6  7 period under the bill, prior to completing any required initial
  6  8 reports, statements, and interviews regarding the recorded
  6  9 event.
  6 10    The bill prohibits a law enforcement agency from using or
  6 11 divulging body camera data for commercial or other non=law
  6 12 enforcement purposes.
  6 13    The bill allows a law enforcement agency to authorize a third
  6 14 party to act as its agent in maintaining body camera data,
  6 15 provided that the agent shall not be permitted to independently
  6 16 examine or alter any data, except to delete data as required by
  6 17 law or agency retention policies.
  6 18    The bill specifies that any member of the public who
  6 19 is a subject of the body camera data, the parent or legal
  6 20 guardian of a minor who is a subject of body camera data, or a
  6 21 deceased person's immediate family member or legally authorized
  6 22 designee, shall be permitted to review that specific body
  6 23 camera data in order to make a determination as to whether to
  6 24 voluntarily request that the body camera data be subject to a
  6 25 two=year retention period under the bill.
  6 26    The bill may include a state mandate as defined in Code
  6 27 section 25B.3.  The bill makes inapplicable Code section 25B.2,
  6 28 subsection 3, which would relieve a political subdivision from
  6 29 complying with a state mandate if funding for the cost of
  6 30 the state mandate is not provided or specified.  Therefore,
  6 31 political subdivisions are required to comply with any state
  6 32 mandate included in the bill.

  4  4                           EXPLANATION
  4  5 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  4  6 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  4  7    This bill relates to access to and retention of peace officer
  4  8 body camera data.
  4  9    The bill defines "body camera" to mean an electronic device
  4 10 that is capable of recording video and audio data or capable of
  4 11 transmitting video or audio data to be recorded remotely, and
  4 12 is worn on the person of a peace officer.
  4 13    The bill defines "peace officer" to mean a peace officer
  4 14 defined in Code section 801.4(11)(a), (b), (c), (f), (g), (h),
  4 15 or (i), which excludes a parole or probation officer.
  4 16    The bill does not require a law enforcement agency or peace
  4 17 officers to use body cameras. However, if a law enforcement
  4 18 agency uses body cameras, the bill sets out a process to retain
  4 19 the body camera data and to  provide access to the data.
  4 20    The bill provides as a general rule that a law enforcement
  4 21 agency that employs a peace officer whose body camera records
  4 22 body camera data shall retain the data for six months from the
  4 23 date it was recorded, after such time the body camera data
  4 24 shall be permanently deleted.
  4 25    The bill requires that body camera data shall be
  4 26 automatically retained for at least two years from the date
  4 27 of the recording under the following circumstances: the data
  4 28 involves any use of force; the data involves events leading
  4 29 up to and including an arrest or detention of a person; the
  4 30 data involves an encounter about which a formal or informal
  4 31 complaint has been registered; the peace officer whose body
  4 32 camera recorded the data voluntarily requests retention if
  4 33 that officer reasonably asserts the data has evidentiary or
  4 34 exculpatory value; a peace officer, who is a subject of the
  4 35 data recorded by another peace officer's body camera, and who
  5  1 voluntarily requests retention, if that officer reasonably
  5  2 asserts that the data has evidentiary or exculpatory value;
  5  3 a superior peace officer who requests retention of data if
  5  4 that superior peace officer reasonably asserts that the data
  5  5 has evidentiary or exculpatory value; a peace officer who
  5  6 voluntarily requests retention if the data is being retained
  5  7 solely and exclusively for law enforcement training purposes;
  5  8 a member of the public who is a subject of the data who
  5  9 voluntarily requests retention; a parent or legal guardian of
  5 10 a minor who is a subject of the data who voluntarily requests
  5 11 retention; or a deceased person's immediate family member or
  5 12 legally authorized designee who voluntarily requests retention.
  5 13    The bill specifies that body camera data involving any use of
  5 14 force by a peace officer shall be a public record and shall not
  5 15 be exempt from public examination.
  5 16    The bill provides that the following persons may examine,
  5 17 obtain a copy of, and disseminate body camera data: a person
  5 18 who is a subject of the data or the person's attorney; a parent
  5 19 or legal guardian of a person who is a minor who is a subject
  5 20 of the data, or the attorney for the parent or legal guardian;
  5 21 the immediate family member or legally authorized designee of a
  5 22 deceased person who is a subject of the data, or the attorney
  5 23 for the immediate family member or legally authorized designee;
  5 24 any other person seeking data, if the person who is a subject
  5 25 of the data, or the attorney for the person who is a subject of
  5 26 the data, has given written authority to the law enforcement
  5 27 agency to disclose the data to that other person, unless the
  5 28 subject of the data is a minor; any other person seeking data,
  5 29 if the parent or legal guardian of a minor who is a subject of
  5 30 the data, or the attorney for the parent or legal guardian,
  5 31 has given written authority to the law enforcement agency to
  5 32 disclose the data to that other person; or any other person
  5 33 seeking data of a deceased person who is a subject of the data,
  5 34 if the immediate family member or legally authorized designee
  5 35 of the deceased person, or the attorney for the immediate
  6  1 family member or legally authorized designee, has given written
  6  2 authority to the law enforcement agency to disclose the data to
  6  3 that other person.
  6  4    The bill prohibits a peace officer from reviewing or
  6  5 receiving an accounting of any body camera data that involves
  6  6 any use of force and is subject to a minimum two=year retention
  6  7 period under the bill, prior to completing any required initial
  6  8 reports, statements, and interviews regarding the recorded
  6  9 event.
  6 10    The bill prohibits a law enforcement agency from using or
  6 11 divulging body camera data for commercial or other non=law
  6 12 enforcement purposes.
  6 13    The bill allows a law enforcement agency to authorize a third
  6 14 party to act as its agent in maintaining body camera data,
  6 15 provided that the agent shall not be permitted to independently
  6 16 examine or alter any data, except to delete data as required by
  6 17 law or agency retention policies.
  6 18    The bill specifies that any member of the public who
  6 19 is a subject of the body camera data, the parent or legal
  6 20 guardian of a minor who is a subject of body camera data, or a
  6 21 deceased person's immediate family member or legally authorized
  6 22 designee, shall be permitted to review that specific body
  6 23 camera data in order to make a determination as to whether to
  6 24 voluntarily request that the body camera data be subject to a
  6 25 two=year retention period under the bill.
  6 26    The bill may include a state mandate as defined in Code
  6 27 section 25B.3.  The bill makes inapplicable Code section 25B.2,
  6 28 subsection 3, which would relieve a political subdivision from
  6 29 complying with a state mandate if funding for the cost of
  6 30 the state mandate is not provided or specified.  Therefore,
  6 31 political subdivisions are required to comply with any state
  6 32 mandate included in the bill.

  6 28 subsection 3, which would relieve a political subdivision from

  5 31 has given written authority to the law enforcement agency to
  5 32 disclose the data to that other person; or any other person
  5 33 seeking data of a deceased person who is a subject of the data,

  4  4                           EXPLANATION
  4  5 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  4  6 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  4  7    This bill relates to access to and retention of peace officer
  4  8 body camera data.
  4  9    The bill defines "body camera" to mean an electronic device
  4 10 that is capable of recording video and audio data or capable of
  4 11 transmitting video or audio data to be recorded remotely, and
  4 12 is worn on the person of a peace officer.
  4 13    The bill defines "peace officer" to mean a peace officer
  4 14 defined in Code section 801.4(11)(a), (b), (c), (f), (g), (h),
  4 15 or (i), which excludes a parole or probation officer.
  4 16    The bill does not require a law enforcement agency or peace
  4 17 officers to use body cameras. However, if a law enforcement
  4 18 agency uses body cameras, the bill sets out a process to retain
  4 19 the body camera data and to  provide access to the data.
  4 20    The bill provides as a general rule that a law enforcement
  4 21 agency that employs a peace officer whose body camera records
  4 22 body camera data shall retain the data for six months from the
  4 23 date it was recorded, after such time the body camera data
  4 24 shall be permanently deleted.
  4 25    The bill requires that body camera data shall be
  4 26 automatically retained for at least two years from the date
  4 27 of the recording under the following circumstances: the data
  4 28 involves any use of force; the data involves events leading
  4 29 up to and including an arrest or detention of a person; the
  4 30 data involves an encounter about which a formal or informal
  4 31 complaint has been registered; the peace officer whose body
  4 32 camera recorded the data voluntarily requests retention if
  4 33 that officer reasonably asserts the data has evidentiary or
  4 34 exculpatory value; a peace officer, who is a subject of the
  4 35 data recorded by another peace officer's body camera, and who
  5  1 voluntarily requests retention, if that officer reasonably
  5  2 asserts that the data has evidentiary or exculpatory value;
  5  3 a superior peace officer who requests retention of data if
  5  4 that superior peace officer reasonably asserts that the data

  5  7 solely and exclusively for law enforcement training purposes;
  5  8 a member of the public who is a subject of the data who
  5  9 voluntarily requests retention; a parent or legal guardian of
  5 10 a minor who is a subject of the data who voluntarily requests
  5 11 retention; or a deceased person's immediate family member or
  5 12 legally authorized designee who voluntarily requests retention.
  5 13    The bill specifies that body camera data involving any use of
  5 14 force by a peace officer shall be a public record and shall not
  5 15 be exempt from public examination.
  5 16    The bill provides that the following persons may examine,
  5 17 obtain a copy of, and disseminate body camera data: a person
  5 18 who is a subject of the data or the person's attorney; a parent
  5 19 or legal guardian of a person who is a minor who is a subject
  5 20 of the data, or the attorney for the parent or legal guardian;
  5 21 the immediate family member or legally authorized designee of a
  5 22 deceased person who is a subject of the data, or the attorney
  5 23 for the immediate family member or legally authorized designee;
  5 24 any other person seeking data, if the person who is a subject
  5 25 of the data, or the attorney for the person who is a subject of
  5 26 the data, has given written authority to the law enforcement
  5 27 agency to disclose the data to that other person, unless the
  5 28 subject of the data is a minor; any other person seeking data,
  5 29 if the parent or legal guardian of a minor who is a subject of
  5 30 the data, or the attorney for the parent or legal guardian,
  5 31 has given written authority to the law enforcement agency to
  5 32 disclose the data to that other person; or any other person
  5 33 seeking data of a deceased person who is a subject of the data,
  5 34 if the immediate family member or legally authorized designee
  5 35 of the deceased person, or the attorney for the immediate
  6  1 family member or legally authorized designee, has given written
  6  2 authority to the law enforcement agency to disclose the data to
  6  3 that other person.
  6  4    The bill prohibits a peace officer from reviewing or
  6  5 receiving an accounting of any body camera data that involves
  6  6 any use of force and is subject to a minimum two=year retention
  6  7 period under the bill, prior to completing any required initial
  6  8 reports, statements, and interviews regarding the recorded
  6  9 event.
  6 10    The bill prohibits a law enforcement agency from using or
  6 11 divulging body camera data for commercial or other non=law
  6 12 enforcement purposes.
  6 13    The bill allows a law enforcement agency to authorize a third
  6 14 party to act as its agent in maintaining body camera data,
  6 15 provided that the agent shall not be permitted to independently
  6 16 examine or alter any data, except to delete data as required by
  6 17 law or agency retention policies.
  6 18    The bill specifies that any member of the public who
  6 19 is a subject of the body camera data, the parent or legal
  6 20 guardian of a minor who is a subject of body camera data, or a
  6 21 deceased person's immediate family member or legally authorized
  6 22 designee, shall be permitted to review that specific body
  6 23 camera data in order to make a determination as to whether to
  6 24 voluntarily request that the body camera data be subject to a
  6 25 two=year retention period under the bill.
  6 26    The bill may include a state mandate as defined in Code
  6 27 section 25B.3.  The bill makes inapplicable Code section 25B.2,
  6 28 subsection 3, which would relieve a political subdivision from
  6 29 complying with a state mandate if funding for the cost of
  6 30 the state mandate is not provided or specified.  Therefore,
  6 31 political subdivisions are required to comply with any state
  6 32 mandate included in the bill.

  4  4                           EXPLANATION
  4  5 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  4  6 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  4  7    This bill relates to access to and retention of peace officer
  4  8 body camera data.
  4  9    The bill defines "body camera" to mean an electronic device
  4 10 that is capable of recording video and audio data or capable of
  4 11 transmitting video or audio data to be recorded remotely, and
  4 12 is worn on the person of a peace officer.
  4 13    The bill defines "peace officer" to mean a peace officer
  4 14 defined in Code section 801.4(11)(a), (b), (c), (f), (g), (h),
  4 15 or (i), which excludes a parole or probation officer.
  4 16    The bill does not require a law enforcement agency or peace
  4 17 officers to use body cameras. However, if a law enforcement
  4 18 agency uses body cameras, the bill sets out a process to retain
  4 19 the body camera data and to  provide access to the data.
  4 20    The bill provides as a general rule that a law enforcement
  4 21 agency that employs a peace officer whose body camera records
  4 22 body camera data shall retain the data for six months from the
  4 23 date it was recorded, after such time the body camera data
  4 24 shall be permanently deleted.
  4 25    The bill requires that body camera data shall be
  4 26 automatically retained for at least two years from the date
  4 27 of the recording under the following circumstances: the data
  4 28 involves any use of force; the data involves events leading
  4 29 up to and including an arrest or detention of a person; the
  4 30 data involves an encounter about which a formal or informal
  4 31 complaint has been registered; the peace officer whose body
  4 32 camera recorded the data voluntarily requests retention if
  4 33 that officer reasonably asserts the data has evidentiary or
  4 34 exculpatory value; a peace officer, who is a subject of the
  4 35 data recorded by another peace officer's body camera, and who
  5  1 voluntarily requests retention, if that officer reasonably
  5  2 asserts that the data has evidentiary or exculpatory value;
  5  3 a superior peace officer who requests retention of data if
  5  4 that superior peace officer reasonably asserts that the data
  5  5 has evidentiary or exculpatory value; a peace officer who
  5  6 voluntarily requests retention if the data is being retained
  5  7 solely and exclusively for law enforcement training purposes;
  5  8 a member of the public who is a subject of the data who
  5  9 voluntarily requests retention; a parent or legal guardian of
  5 10 a minor who is a subject of the data who voluntarily requests
  5 11 retention; or a deceased person's immediate family member or
  5 12 legally authorized designee who voluntarily requests retention.
  5 13    The bill specifies that body camera data involving any use of
  5 14 force by a peace officer shall be a public record and shall not
  5 15 be exempt from public examination.
  5 16    The bill provides that the following persons may examine,
  5 17 obtain a copy of, and disseminate body camera data: a person
  5 18 who is a subject of the data or the person's attorney; a parent
  5 19 or legal guardian of a person who is a minor who is a subject
  5 20 of the data, or the attorney for the parent or legal guardian;
  5 21 the immediate family member or legally authorized designee of a
  5 22 deceased person who is a subject of the data, or the attorney
  5 23 for the immediate family member or legally authorized designee;
  5 24 any other person seeking data, if the person who is a subject
  5 25 of the data, or the attorney for the person who is a subject of
  5 26 the data, has given written authority to the law enforcement
  5 27 agency to disclose the data to that other person, unless the
  5 28 subject of the data is a minor; any other person seeking data,
  5 29 if the parent or legal guardian of a minor who is a subject of
  5 30 the data, or the attorney for the parent or legal guardian,
  5 31 has given written authority to the law enforcement agency to
  5 32 disclose the data to that other person; or any other person
  5 33 seeking data of a deceased person who is a subject of the data,
  5 34 if the immediate family member or legally authorized designee
  5 35 of the deceased person, or the attorney for the immediate
  6  1 family member or legally authorized designee, has given written
  6  2 authority to the law enforcement agency to disclose the data to
  6  3 that other person.
  6  4    The bill prohibits a peace officer from reviewing or
  6  5 receiving an accounting of any body camera data that involves
  6  6 any use of force and is subject to a minimum two=year retention
  6  7 period under the bill, prior to completing any required initial
  6  8 reports, statements, and interviews regarding the recorded
  6  9 event.
  6 10    The bill prohibits a law enforcement agency from using or
  6 11 divulging body camera data for commercial or other non=law
  6 12 enforcement purposes.
  6 13    The bill allows a law enforcement agency to authorize a third
  6 14 party to act as its agent in maintaining body camera data,
  6 15 provided that the agent shall not be permitted to independently
  6 16 examine or alter any data, except to delete data as required by
  6 17 law or agency retention policies.
  6 18    The bill specifies that any member of the public who
  6 19 is a subject of the body camera data, the parent or legal
  6 20 guardian of a minor who is a subject of body camera data, or a
  6 21 deceased person's immediate family member or legally authorized
  6 22 designee, shall be permitted to review that specific body
  6 23 camera data in order to make a determination as to whether to
  6 24 voluntarily request that the body camera data be subject to a
  6 25 two=year retention period under the bill.
  6 26    The bill may include a state mandate as defined in Code
  6 27 section 25B.3.  The bill makes inapplicable Code section 25B.2,
  6 28 subsection 3, which would relieve a political subdivision from
  6 29 complying with a state mandate if funding for the cost of
  6 30 the state mandate is not provided or specified.  Therefore,
  6 31 political subdivisions are required to comply with any state
  6 32 mandate included in the bill.

  6  7 period under the bill, prior to completing any required initial
  6  8 reports, statements, and interviews regarding the recorded
  6  9 event.

  6 28 subsection 3, which would relieve a political subdivision from
  6 29 complying with a state mandate if funding for the cost of

  4  7    This bill relates to access to and retention of peace officer
  4  8 body camera data.
  4  9    The bill defines "body camera" to mean an electronic device
  4 10 that is capable of recording video and audio data or capable of

  4 14 defined in Code section 801.4(11)(a), (b), (c), (f), (g), (h),

  4 16    The bill does not require a law enforcement agency or peace
  4 17 officers to use body cameras. However, if a law enforcement
  4 18 agency uses body cameras, the bill sets out a process to retain
  4 19 the body camera data and to  provide access to the data.
  4 20    The bill provides as a general rule that a law enforcement
  4 21 agency that employs a peace officer whose body camera records
  4 22 body camera data shall retain the data for six months from the
  4 23 date it was recorded, after such time the body camera data
  4 24 shall be permanently deleted.

  5 13    The bill specifies that body camera data involving any use of
  5 14 force by a peace officer shall be a public record and shall not
  5 15 be exempt from public examination.

  5 26 the data, has given written authority to the law enforcement
  5 27 agency to disclose the data to that other person, unless the
  5 28 subject of the data is a minor; any other person seeking data,
  5 29 if the parent or legal guardian of a minor who is a subject of
  5 30 the data, or the attorney for the parent or legal guardian,
  5 31 has given written authority to the law enforcement agency to
  5 32 disclose the data to that other person; or any other person
  5 33 seeking data of a deceased person who is a subject of the data,
  5 34 if the immediate family member or legally authorized designee
  5 35 of the deceased person, or the attorney for the immediate
  6  1 family member or legally authorized designee, has given written
  6  2 authority to the law enforcement agency to disclose the data to
  6  3 that other person.
  6  4    The bill prohibits a peace officer from reviewing or
  6  5 receiving an accounting of any body camera data that involves
  6  6 any use of force and is subject to a minimum two=year retention
  6  7 period under the bill, prior to completing any required initial
  6  8 reports, statements, and interviews regarding the recorded
  6  9 event.
  6 10    The bill prohibits a law enforcement agency from using or
  6 11 divulging body camera data for commercial or other non=law
  6 12 enforcement purposes.
  6 13    The bill allows a law enforcement agency to authorize a third

  6 15 provided that the agent shall not be permitted to independently
  6 16 examine or alter any data, except to delete data as required by

  6 23 camera data in order to make a determination as to whether to
  6 24 voluntarily request that the body camera data be subject to a

  6 26    The bill may include a state mandate as defined in Code
  6 27 section 25B.3.  The bill makes inapplicable Code section 25B.2,
  6 28 subsection 3, which would relieve a political subdivision from

  4  4                           EXPLANATION
  4  5 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  4  6 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  4  7    This bill relates to access to and retention of peace officer
  4  8 body camera data.
  4  9    The bill defines "body camera" to mean an electronic device
  4 10 that is capable of recording video and audio data or capable of
  4 11 transmitting video or audio data to be recorded remotely, and
  4 12 is worn on the person of a peace officer.
  4 13    The bill defines "peace officer" to mean a peace officer
  4 14 defined in Code section 801.4(11)(a), (b), (c), (f), (g), (h),
  4 15 or (i), which excludes a parole or probation officer.
  4 16    The bill does not require a law enforcement agency or peace
  4 17 officers to use body cameras. However, if a law enforcement
  4 18 agency uses body cameras, the bill sets out a process to retain
  4 19 the body camera data and to  provide access to the data.
  4 20    The bill provides as a general rule that a law enforcement
  4 21 agency that employs a peace officer whose body camera records
  4 22 body camera data shall retain the data for six months from the
  4 23 date it was recorded, after such time the body camera data
  4 24 shall be permanently deleted.
  4 25    The bill requires that body camera data shall be
  4 26 automatically retained for at least two years from the date
  4 27 of the recording under the following circumstances: the data
  4 28 involves any use of force; the data involves events leading
  4 29 up to and including an arrest or detention of a person; the
  4 30 data involves an encounter about which a formal or informal
  4 31 complaint has been registered; the peace officer whose body
  4 32 camera recorded the data voluntarily requests retention if
  4 33 that officer reasonably asserts the data has evidentiary or
  4 34 exculpatory value; a peace officer, who is a subject of the
  4 35 data recorded by another peace officer's body camera, and who
  5  1 voluntarily requests retention, if that officer reasonably
  5  2 asserts that the data has evidentiary or exculpatory value;
  5  3 a superior peace officer who requests retention of data if
  5  4 that superior peace officer reasonably asserts that the data
  5  5 has evidentiary or exculpatory value; a peace officer who
  5  6 voluntarily requests retention if the data is being retained
  5  7 solely and exclusively for law enforcement training purposes;
  5  8 a member of the public who is a subject of the data who
  5  9 voluntarily requests retention; a parent or legal guardian of
  5 10 a minor who is a subject of the data who voluntarily requests
  5 11 retention; or a deceased person's immediate family member or
  5 12 legally authorized designee who voluntarily requests retention.
  5 13    The bill specifies that body camera data involving any use of
  5 14 force by a peace officer shall be a public record and shall not
  5 15 be exempt from public examination.
  5 16    The bill provides that the following persons may examine,
  5 17 obtain a copy of, and disseminate body camera data: a person
  5 18 who is a subject of the data or the person's attorney; a parent
  5 19 or legal guardian of a person who is a minor who is a subject
  5 20 of the data, or the attorney for the parent or legal guardian;
  5 21 the immediate family member or legally authorized designee of a
  5 22 deceased person who is a subject of the data, or the attorney
  5 23 for the immediate family member or legally authorized designee;
  5 24 any other person seeking data, if the person who is a subject
  5 25 of the data, or the attorney for the person who is a subject of
  5 26 the data, has given written authority to the law enforcement
  5 27 agency to disclose the data to that other person, unless the
  5 28 subject of the data is a minor; any other person seeking data,
  5 29 if the parent or legal guardian of a minor who is a subject of
  5 30 the data, or the attorney for the parent or legal guardian,
  5 31 has given written authority to the law enforcement agency to
  5 32 disclose the data to that other person; or any other person
  5 33 seeking data of a deceased person who is a subject of the data,
  5 34 if the immediate family member or legally authorized designee
  5 35 of the deceased person, or the attorney for the immediate
  6  1 family member or legally authorized designee, has given written
  6  2 authority to the law enforcement agency to disclose the data to
  6  3 that other person.
  6  4    The bill prohibits a peace officer from reviewing or
  6  5 receiving an accounting of any body camera data that involves
  6  6 any use of force and is subject to a minimum two=year retention
  6  7 period under the bill, prior to completing any required initial
  6  8 reports, statements, and interviews regarding the recorded
  6  9 event.
  6 10    The bill prohibits a law enforcement agency from using or
  6 11 divulging body camera data for commercial or other non=law
  6 12 enforcement purposes.
  6 13    The bill allows a law enforcement agency to authorize a third
  6 14 party to act as its agent in maintaining body camera data,
  6 15 provided that the agent shall not be permitted to independently
  6 16 examine or alter any data, except to delete data as required by
  6 17 law or agency retention policies.
  6 18    The bill specifies that any member of the public who
  6 19 is a subject of the body camera data, the parent or legal
  6 20 guardian of a minor who is a subject of body camera data, or a
  6 21 deceased person's immediate family member or legally authorized
  6 22 designee, shall be permitted to review that specific body
  6 23 camera data in order to make a determination as to whether to
  6 24 voluntarily request that the body camera data be subject to a
  6 25 two=year retention period under the bill.
  6 26    The bill may include a state mandate as defined in Code
  6 27 section 25B.3.  The bill makes inapplicable Code section 25B.2,
  6 28 subsection 3, which would relieve a political subdivision from
  6 29 complying with a state mandate if funding for the cost of
  6 30 the state mandate is not provided or specified.  Therefore,
  6 31 political subdivisions are required to comply with any state
  6 32 mandate included in the bill.

  4  4                           EXPLANATION
  4  5 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  4  6 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  4  7    This bill relates to access to and retention of peace officer
  4  8 body camera data.
  4  9    The bill defines "body camera" to mean an electronic device
  4 10 that is capable of recording video and audio data or capable of
  4 11 transmitting video or audio data to be recorded remotely, and
  4 12 is worn on the person of a peace officer.
  4 13    The bill defines "peace officer" to mean a peace officer
  4 14 defined in Code section 801.4(11)(a), (b), (c), (f), (g), (h),
  4 15 or (i), which excludes a parole or probation officer.
  4 16    The bill does not require a law enforcement agency or peace
  4 17 officers to use body cameras. However, if a law enforcement
  4 18 agency uses body cameras, the bill sets out a process to retain
  4 19 the body camera data and to  provide access to the data.
  4 20    The bill provides as a general rule that a law enforcement
  4 21 agency that employs a peace officer whose body camera records
  4 22 body camera data shall retain the data for six months from the
  4 23 date it was recorded, after such time the body camera data
  4 24 shall be permanently deleted.
  4 25    The bill requires that body camera data shall be
  4 26 automatically retained for at least two years from the date
  4 27 of the recording under the following circumstances: the data
  4 28 involves any use of force; the data involves events leading
  4 29 up to and including an arrest or detention of a person; the
  4 30 data involves an encounter about which a formal or informal
  4 31 complaint has been registered; the peace officer whose body
  4 32 camera recorded the data voluntarily requests retention if
  4 33 that officer reasonably asserts the data has evidentiary or
  4 34 exculpatory value; a peace officer, who is a subject of the
  4 35 data recorded by another peace officer's body camera, and who
  5  1 voluntarily requests retention, if that officer reasonably
  5  2 asserts that the data has evidentiary or exculpatory value;
  5  3 a superior peace officer who requests retention of data if
  5  4 that superior peace officer reasonably asserts that the data
  5  5 has evidentiary or exculpatory value; a peace officer who
  5  6 voluntarily requests retention if the data is being retained
  5  7 solely and exclusively for law enforcement training purposes;
  5  8 a member of the public who is a subject of the data who
  5  9 voluntarily requests retention; a parent or legal guardian of
  5 10 a minor who is a subject of the data who voluntarily requests
  5 11 retention; or a deceased person's immediate family member or
  5 12 legally authorized designee who voluntarily requests retention.
  5 13    The bill specifies that body camera data involving any use of
  5 14 force by a peace officer shall be a public record and shall not
  5 15 be exempt from public examination.
  5 16    The bill provides that the following persons may examine,
  5 17 obtain a copy of, and disseminate body camera data: a person
  5 18 who is a subject of the data or the person's attorney; a parent
  5 19 or legal guardian of a person who is a minor who is a subject
  5 20 of the data, or the attorney for the parent or legal guardian;
  5 21 the immediate family member or legally authorized designee of a
  5 22 deceased person who is a subject of the data, or the attorney
  5 23 for the immediate family member or legally authorized designee;
  5 24 any other person seeking data, if the person who is a subject
  5 25 of the data, or the attorney for the person who is a subject of
  5 26 the data, has given written authority to the law enforcement
  5 27 agency to disclose the data to that other person, unless the
  5 28 subject of the data is a minor; any other person seeking data,
  5 29 if the parent or legal guardian of a minor who is a subject of
  5 30 the data, or the attorney for the parent or legal guardian,
  5 31 has given written authority to the law enforcement agency to
  5 32 disclose the data to that other person; or any other person
  5 33 seeking data of a deceased person who is a subject of the data,
  5 34 if the immediate family member or legally authorized designee
  5 35 of the deceased person, or the attorney for the immediate
  6  1 family member or legally authorized designee, has given written
  6  2 authority to the law enforcement agency to disclose the data to
  6  3 that other person.
  6  4    The bill prohibits a peace officer from reviewing or
  6  5 receiving an accounting of any body camera data that involves
  6  6 any use of force and is subject to a minimum two=year retention
  6  7 period under the bill, prior to completing any required initial
  6  8 reports, statements, and interviews regarding the recorded
  6  9 event.
  6 10    The bill prohibits a law enforcement agency from using or
  6 11 divulging body camera data for commercial or other non=law
  6 12 enforcement purposes.
  6 13    The bill allows a law enforcement agency to authorize a third
  6 14 party to act as its agent in maintaining body camera data,
  6 15 provided that the agent shall not be permitted to independently
  6 16 examine or alter any data, except to delete data as required by
  6 17 law or agency retention policies.
  6 18    The bill specifies that any member of the public who
  6 19 is a subject of the body camera data, the parent or legal
  6 20 guardian of a minor who is a subject of body camera data, or a
  6 21 deceased person's immediate family member or legally authorized
  6 22 designee, shall be permitted to review that specific body
  6 23 camera data in order to make a determination as to whether to
  6 24 voluntarily request that the body camera data be subject to a
  6 25 two=year retention period under the bill.
  6 26    The bill may include a state mandate as defined in Code
  6 27 section 25B.3.  The bill makes inapplicable Code section 25B.2,
  6 28 subsection 3, which would relieve a political subdivision from
  6 29 complying with a state mandate if funding for the cost of
  6 30 the state mandate is not provided or specified.  Therefore,
  6 31 political subdivisions are required to comply with any state
  6 32 mandate included in the bill.

  4  5 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  4  6 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  4  7    This bill relates to access to and retention of peace officer
  4  8 body camera data.
  4  9    The bill defines "body camera" to mean an electronic device
  4 10 that is capable of recording video and audio data or capable of
  4 11 transmitting video or audio data to be recorded remotely, and
  4 12 is worn on the person of a peace officer.
  4 13    The bill defines "peace officer" to mean a peace officer
  4 14 defined in Code section 801.4(11)(a), (b), (c), (f), (g), (h),
  4 15 or (i), which excludes a parole or probation officer.
  4 16    The bill does not require a law enforcement agency or peace
  4 17 officers to use body cameras. However, if a law enforcement
  4 18 agency uses body cameras, the bill sets out a process to retain
  4 19 the body camera data and to  provide access to the data.
  4 20    The bill provides as a general rule that a law enforcement
  4 21 agency that employs a peace officer whose body camera records
  4 22 body camera data shall retain the data for six months from the
  4 23 date it was recorded, after such time the body camera data
  4 24 shall be permanently deleted.
  4 25    The bill requires that body camera data shall be
  4 26 automatically retained for at least two years from the date
  4 27 of the recording under the following circumstances: the data
  4 28 involves any use of force; the data involves events leading
  4 29 up to and including an arrest or detention of a person; the
  4 30 data involves an encounter about which a formal or informal
  4 31 complaint has been registered; the peace officer whose body
  4 32 camera recorded the data voluntarily requests retention if
  4 33 that officer reasonably asserts the data has evidentiary or
  4 34 exculpatory value; a peace officer, who is a subject of the
  4 35 data recorded by another peace officer's body camera, and who
  5  1 voluntarily requests retention, if that officer reasonably
  5  2 asserts that the data has evidentiary or exculpatory value;
  5  3 a superior peace officer who requests retention of data if
  5  4 that superior peace officer reasonably asserts that the data
  5  5 has evidentiary or exculpatory value; a peace officer who
  5  6 voluntarily requests retention if the data is being retained
  5  7 solely and exclusively for law enforcement training purposes;
  5  8 a member of the public who is a subject of the data who
  5  9 voluntarily requests retention; a parent or legal guardian of
  5 10 a minor who is a subject of the data who voluntarily requests
  5 11 retention; or a deceased person's immediate family member or
  5 12 legally authorized designee who voluntarily requests retention.
  5 13    The bill specifies that body camera data involving any use of
  5 14 force by a peace officer shall be a public record and shall not
  5 15 be exempt from public examination.
  5 16    The bill provides that the following persons may examine,
  5 17 obtain a copy of, and disseminate body camera data: a person
  5 18 who is a subject of the data or the person's attorney; a parent
  5 19 or legal guardian of a person who is a minor who is a subject
  5 20 of the data, or the attorney for the parent or legal guardian;
  5 21 the immediate family member or legally authorized designee of a
  5 22 deceased person who is a subject of the data, or the attorney
  5 23 for the immediate family member or legally authorized designee;
  5 24 any other person seeking data, if the person who is a subject
  5 25 of the data, or the attorney for the person who is a subject of
  5 26 the data, has given written authority to the law enforcement
  5 27 agency to disclose the data to that other person, unless the
  5 28 subject of the data is a minor; any other person seeking data,
  5 29 if the parent or legal guardian of a minor who is a subject of
  5 30 the data, or the attorney for the parent or legal guardian,
  5 31 has given written authority to the law enforcement agency to
  5 32 disclose the data to that other person; or any other person
  5 33 seeking data of a deceased person who is a subject of the data,
  5 34 if the immediate family member or legally authorized designee
  5 35 of the deceased person, or the attorney for the immediate
  6  1 family member or legally authorized designee, has given written
  6  2 authority to the law enforcement agency to disclose the data to
  6  3 that other person.
  6  4    The bill prohibits a peace officer from reviewing or
  6  5 receiving an accounting of any body camera data that involves
  6  6 any use of force and is subject to a minimum two=year retention
  6  7 period under the bill, prior to completing any required initial
  6  8 reports, statements, and interviews regarding the recorded
  6  9 event.
  6 10    The bill prohibits a law enforcement agency from using or
  6 11 divulging body camera data for commercial or other non=law
  6 12 enforcement purposes.
  6 13    The bill allows a law enforcement agency to authorize a third
  6 14 party to act as its agent in maintaining body camera data,
  6 15 provided that the agent shall not be permitted to independently
  6 16 examine or alter any data, except to delete data as required by
  6 17 law or agency retention policies.
  6 18    The bill specifies that any member of the public who
  6 19 is a subject of the body camera data, the parent or legal
  6 20 guardian of a minor who is a subject of body camera data, or a
  6 21 deceased person's immediate family member or legally authorized
  6 22 designee, shall be permitted to review that specific body
  6 23 camera data in order to make a determination as to whether to
  6 24 voluntarily request that the body camera data be subject to a
  6 25 two=year retention period under the bill.
  6 26    The bill may include a state mandate as defined in Code
  6 27 section 25B.3.  The bill makes inapplicable Code section 25B.2,
  6 28 subsection 3, which would relieve a political subdivision from
  6 29 complying with a state mandate if funding for the cost of
  6 30 the state mandate is not provided or specified.  Therefore,
  6 31 political subdivisions are required to comply with any state
  6 32 mandate included in the bill.

  4  4                           EXPLANATION
  4  5 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  4  6 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  4  7    This bill relates to access to and retention of peace officer
  4  8 body camera data.
  4  9    The bill defines "body camera" to mean an electronic device
  4 10 that is capable of recording video and audio data or capable of
  4 11 transmitting video or audio data to be recorded remotely, and
  4 12 is worn on the person of a peace officer.
  4 13    The bill defines "peace officer" to mean a peace officer
  4 14 defined in Code section 801.4(11)(a), (b), (c), (f), (g), (h),
  4 15 or (i), which excludes a parole or probation officer.
  4 16    The bill does not require a law enforcement agency or peace
  4 17 officers to use body cameras. However, if a law enforcement
  4 18 agency uses body cameras, the bill sets out a process to retain
  4 19 the body camera data and to  provide access to the data.
  4 20    The bill provides as a general rule that a law enforcement
  4 21 agency that employs a peace officer whose body camera records
  4 22 body camera data shall retain the data for six months from the
  4 23 date it was recorded, after such time the body camera data
  4 24 shall be permanently deleted.
  4 25    The bill requires that body camera data shall be
  4 26 automatically retained for at least two years from the date
  4 27 of the recording under the following circumstances: the data
  4 28 involves any use of force; the data involves events leading
  4 29 up to and including an arrest or detention of a person; the
  4 30 data involves an encounter about which a formal or informal
  4 31 complaint has been registered; the peace officer whose body
  4 32 camera recorded the data voluntarily requests retention if
  4 33 that officer reasonably asserts the data has evidentiary or
  4 34 exculpatory value; a peace officer, who is a subject of the
  4 35 data recorded by another peace officer's body camera, and who
  5  1 voluntarily requests retention, if that officer reasonably
  5  2 asserts that the data has evidentiary or exculpatory value;
  5  3 a superior peace officer who requests retention of data if
  5  4 that superior peace officer reasonably asserts that the data
  5  5 has evidentiary or exculpatory value; a peace officer who
  5  6 voluntarily requests retention if the data is being retained
  5  7 solely and exclusively for law enforcement training purposes;
  5  8 a member of the public who is a subject of the data who
  5  9 voluntarily requests retention; a parent or legal guardian of
  5 10 a minor who is a subject of the data who voluntarily requests
  5 11 retention; or a deceased person's immediate family member or
  5 12 legally authorized designee who voluntarily requests retention.
  5 13    The bill specifies that body camera data involving any use of
  5 14 force by a peace officer shall be a public record and shall not
  5 15 be exempt from public examination.
  5 16    The bill provides that the following persons may examine,
  5 17 obtain a copy of, and disseminate body camera data: a person
  5 18 who is a subject of the data or the person's attorney; a parent
  5 19 or legal guardian of a person who is a minor who is a subject
  5 20 of the data, or the attorney for the parent or legal guardian;
  5 21 the immediate family member or legally authorized designee of a
  5 22 deceased person who is a subject of the data, or the attorney
  5 23 for the immediate family member or legally authorized designee;
  5 24 any other person seeking data, if the person who is a subject
  5 25 of the data, or the attorney for the person who is a subject of
  5 26 the data, has given written authority to the law enforcement
  5 27 agency to disclose the data to that other person, unless the
  5 28 subject of the data is a minor; any other person seeking data,
  5 29 if the parent or legal guardian of a minor who is a subject of
  5 30 the data, or the attorney for the parent or legal guardian,
  5 31 has given written authority to the law enforcement agency to
  5 32 disclose the data to that other person; or any other person
  5 33 seeking data of a deceased person who is a subject of the data,
  5 34 if the immediate family member or legally authorized designee
  5 35 of the deceased person, or the attorney for the immediate
  6  1 family member or legally authorized designee, has given written
  6  2 authority to the law enforcement agency to disclose the data to
  6  3 that other person.
  6  4    The bill prohibits a peace officer from reviewing or
  6  5 receiving an accounting of any body camera data that involves
  6  6 any use of force and is subject to a minimum two=year retention
  6  7 period under the bill, prior to completing any required initial
  6  8 reports, statements, and interviews regarding the recorded
  6  9 event.
  6 10    The bill prohibits a law enforcement agency from using or
  6 11 divulging body camera data for commercial or other non=law
  6 12 enforcement purposes.
  6 13    The bill allows a law enforcement agency to authorize a third
  6 14 party to act as its agent in maintaining body camera data,
  6 15 provided that the agent shall not be permitted to independently
  6 16 examine or alter any data, except to delete data as required by
  6 17 law or agency retention policies.
  6 18    The bill specifies that any member of the public who
  6 19 is a subject of the body camera data, the parent or legal
  6 20 guardian of a minor who is a subject of body camera data, or a
  6 21 deceased person's immediate family member or legally authorized
  6 22 designee, shall be permitted to review that specific body
  6 23 camera data in order to make a determination as to whether to
  6 24 voluntarily request that the body camera data be subject to a
  6 25 two=year retention period under the bill.
  6 26    The bill may include a state mandate as defined in Code
  6 27 section 25B.3.  The bill makes inapplicable Code section 25B.2,
  6 28 subsection 3, which would relieve a political subdivision from
  6 29 complying with a state mandate if funding for the cost of
  6 30 the state mandate is not provided or specified.  Therefore,
  6 31 political subdivisions are required to comply with any state
  6 32 mandate included in the bill.

  4 19 the body camera data and to  provide access to the data.
  4 20    The bill provides as a general rule that a law enforcement
  4 21 agency that employs a peace officer whose body camera records

  4 27 of the recording under the following circumstances: the data
  4 28 involves any use of force; the data involves events leading
  4 29 up to and including an arrest or detention of a person; the
  4 30 data involves an encounter about which a formal or informal

  4 33 that officer reasonably asserts the data has evidentiary or
  4 34 exculpatory value; a peace officer, who is a subject of the
  4 35 data recorded by another peace officer's body camera, and who
  5  1 voluntarily requests retention, if that officer reasonably

  5 12 legally authorized designee who voluntarily requests retention.
  5 13    The bill specifies that body camera data involving any use of
  5 14 force by a peace officer shall be a public record and shall not
  5 15 be exempt from public examination.
  5 16    The bill provides that the following persons may examine,
  5 17 obtain a copy of, and disseminate body camera data: a person
  5 18 who is a subject of the data or the person's attorney; a parent
  5 19 or legal guardian of a person who is a minor who is a subject
  5 20 of the data, or the attorney for the parent or legal guardian;

  5 25 of the data, or the attorney for the person who is a subject of
  5 26 the data, has given written authority to the law enforcement
  5 27 agency to disclose the data to that other person, unless the
  5 28 subject of the data is a minor; any other person seeking data,
  5 29 if the parent or legal guardian of a minor who is a subject of
  5 30 the data, or the attorney for the parent or legal guardian,
  5 31 has given written authority to the law enforcement agency to
  5 32 disclose the data to that other person; or any other person
  5 33 seeking data of a deceased person who is a subject of the data,
  5 34 if the immediate family member or legally authorized designee
  5 35 of the deceased person, or the attorney for the immediate
  6  1 family member or legally authorized designee, has given written
  6  2 authority to the law enforcement agency to disclose the data to
  6  3 that other person.
  6  4    The bill prohibits a peace officer from reviewing or
  6  5 receiving an accounting of any body camera data that involves
  6  6 any use of force and is subject to a minimum two=year retention
  6  7 period under the bill, prior to completing any required initial
  6  8 reports, statements, and interviews regarding the recorded
  6  9 event.
  6 10    The bill prohibits a law enforcement agency from using or
  6 11 divulging body camera data for commercial or other non=law
  6 12 enforcement purposes.
  6 13    The bill allows a law enforcement agency to authorize a third
  6 14 party to act as its agent in maintaining body camera data,
  6 15 provided that the agent shall not be permitted to independently
  6 16 examine or alter any data, except to delete data as required by
  6 17 law or agency retention policies.

  6 22 designee, shall be permitted to review that specific body
  6 23 camera data in order to make a determination as to whether to
  6 24 voluntarily request that the body camera data be subject to a
  6 25 two=year retention period under the bill.
  6 26    The bill may include a state mandate as defined in Code
  6 27 section 25B.3.  The bill makes inapplicable Code section 25B.2,
  6 28 subsection 3, which would relieve a political subdivision from
  6 29 complying with a state mandate if funding for the cost of
  6 30 the state mandate is not provided or specified.  Therefore,
  6 31 political subdivisions are required to comply with any state
  6 32 mandate included in the bill.

  4  5 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  4  6 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  4  7    This bill relates to access to and retention of peace officer
  4  8 body camera data.
  4  9    The bill defines "body camera" to mean an electronic device
  4 10 that is capable of recording video and audio data or capable of
  4 11 transmitting video or audio data to be recorded remotely, and
  4 12 is worn on the person of a peace officer.
  4 13    The bill defines "peace officer" to mean a peace officer
  4 14 defined in Code section 801.4(11)(a), (b), (c), (f), (g), (h),
  4 15 or (i), which excludes a parole or probation officer.
  4 16    The bill does not require a law enforcement agency or peace
  4 17 officers to use body cameras. However, if a law enforcement
  4 18 agency uses body cameras, the bill sets out a process to retain
  4 19 the body camera data and to  provide access to the data.
  4 20    The bill provides as a general rule that a law enforcement
  4 21 agency that employs a peace officer whose body camera records
  4 22 body camera data shall retain the data for six months from the
  4 23 date it was recorded, after such time the body camera data
  4 24 shall be permanently deleted.
  4 25    The bill requires that body camera data shall be
  4 26 automatically retained for at least two years from the date
  4 27 of the recording under the following circumstances: the data
  4 28 involves any use of force; the data involves events leading
  4 29 up to and including an arrest or detention of a person; the
  4 30 data involves an encounter about which a formal or informal
  4 31 complaint has been registered; the peace officer whose body
  4 32 camera recorded the data voluntarily requests retention if
  4 33 that officer reasonably asserts the data has evidentiary or
  4 34 exculpatory value; a peace officer, who is a subject of the
  4 35 data recorded by another peace officer's body camera, and who
  5  1 voluntarily requests retention, if that officer reasonably
  5  2 asserts that the data has evidentiary or exculpatory value;
  5  3 a superior peace officer who requests retention of data if
  5  4 that superior peace officer reasonably asserts that the data
  5  5 has evidentiary or exculpatory value; a peace officer who
  5  6 voluntarily requests retention if the data is being retained
  5  7 solely and exclusively for law enforcement training purposes;
  5  8 a member of the public who is a subject of the data who
  5  9 voluntarily requests retention; a parent or legal guardian of
  5 10 a minor who is a subject of the data who voluntarily requests
  5 11 retention; or a deceased person's immediate family member or
  5 12 legally authorized designee who voluntarily requests retention.
  5 13    The bill specifies that body camera data involving any use of
  5 14 force by a peace officer shall be a public record and shall not
  5 15 be exempt from public examination.
  5 16    The bill provides that the following persons may examine,
  5 17 obtain a copy of, and disseminate body camera data: a person
  5 18 who is a subject of the data or the person's attorney; a parent
  5 19 or legal guardian of a person who is a minor who is a subject
  5 20 of the data, or the attorney for the parent or legal guardian;
  5 21 the immediate family member or legally authorized designee of a
  5 22 deceased person who is a subject of the data, or the attorney
  5 23 for the immediate family member or legally authorized designee;
  5 24 any other person seeking data, if the person who is a subject
  5 25 of the data, or the attorney for the person who is a subject of
  5 26 the data, has given written authority to the law enforcement
  5 27 agency to disclose the data to that other person, unless the
  5 28 subject of the data is a minor; any other person seeking data,
  5 29 if the parent or legal guardian of a minor who is a subject of
  5 30 the data, or the attorney for the parent or legal guardian,
  5 31 has given written authority to the law enforcement agency to
  5 32 disclose the data to that other person; or any other person
  5 33 seeking data of a deceased person who is a subject of the data,
  5 34 if the immediate family member or legally authorized designee
  5 35 of the deceased person, or the attorney for the immediate
  6  1 family member or legally authorized designee, has given written
  6  2 authority to the law enforcement agency to disclose the data to
  6  3 that other person.
  6  4    The bill prohibits a peace officer from reviewing or
  6  5 receiving an accounting of any body camera data that involves
  6  6 any use of force and is subject to a minimum two=year retention
  6  7 period under the bill, prior to completing any required initial
  6  8 reports, statements, and interviews regarding the recorded
  6  9 event.
  6 10    The bill prohibits a law enforcement agency from using or
  6 11 divulging body camera data for commercial or other non=law
  6 12 enforcement purposes.
  6 13    The bill allows a law enforcement agency to authorize a third
  6 14 party to act as its agent in maintaining body camera data,
  6 15 provided that the agent shall not be permitted to independently
  6 16 examine or alter any data, except to delete data as required by
  6 17 law or agency retention policies.
  6 18    The bill specifies that any member of the public who
  6 19 is a subject of the body camera data, the parent or legal
  6 20 guardian of a minor who is a subject of body camera data, or a
  6 21 deceased person's immediate family member or legally authorized
  6 22 designee, shall be permitted to review that specific body
  6 23 camera data in order to make a determination as to whether to
  6 24 voluntarily request that the body camera data be subject to a
  6 25 two=year retention period under the bill.
  6 26    The bill may include a state mandate as defined in Code
  6 27 section 25B.3.  The bill makes inapplicable Code section 25B.2,
  6 28 subsection 3, which would relieve a political subdivision from
  6 29 complying with a state mandate if funding for the cost of
  6 30 the state mandate is not provided or specified.  Therefore,
  6 31 political subdivisions are required to comply with any state
  6 32 mandate included in the bill.

  4 19 the body camera data and to  provide access to the data.

  4 21 agency that employs a peace officer whose body camera records
  4 22 body camera data shall retain the data for six months from the

  5 13    The bill specifies that body camera data involving any use of
  5 14 force by a peace officer shall be a public record and shall not
  5 15 be exempt from public examination.

  5 25 of the data, or the attorney for the person who is a subject of
  5 26 the data, has given written authority to the law enforcement
  5 27 agency to disclose the data to that other person, unless the
  5 28 subject of the data is a minor; any other person seeking data,
  5 29 if the parent or legal guardian of a minor who is a subject of
  5 30 the data, or the attorney for the parent or legal guardian,
  5 31 has given written authority to the law enforcement agency to
  5 32 disclose the data to that other person; or any other person
  5 33 seeking data of a deceased person who is a subject of the data,

  5 35 of the deceased person, or the attorney for the immediate
  6  1 family member or legally authorized designee, has given written
  6  2 authority to the law enforcement agency to disclose the data to
  6  3 that other person.
  6  4    The bill prohibits a peace officer from reviewing or
  6  5 receiving an accounting of any body camera data that involves
  6  6 any use of force and is subject to a minimum two=year retention
  6  7 period under the bill, prior to completing any required initial
  6  8 reports, statements, and interviews regarding the recorded
  6  9 event.
  6 10    The bill prohibits a law enforcement agency from using or
  6 11 divulging body camera data for commercial or other non=law

  6 15 provided that the agent shall not be permitted to independently
  6 16 examine or alter any data, except to delete data as required by
  6 17 law or agency retention policies.

  6 22 designee, shall be permitted to review that specific body
  6 23 camera data in order to make a determination as to whether to
  6 24 voluntarily request that the body camera data be subject to a

  6 26    The bill may include a state mandate as defined in Code

  4  4                           EXPLANATION
  4  5 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  4  6 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  4  7    This bill relates to access to and retention of peace officer
  4  8 body camera data.
  4  9    The bill defines "body camera" to mean an electronic device
  4 10 that is capable of recording video and audio data or capable of
  4 11 transmitting video or audio data to be recorded remotely, and
  4 12 is worn on the person of a peace officer.
  4 13    The bill defines "peace officer" to mean a peace officer
  4 14 defined in Code section 801.4(11)(a), (b), (c), (f), (g), (h),
  4 15 or (i), which excludes a parole or probation officer.
  4 16    The bill does not require a law enforcement agency or peace
  4 17 officers to use body cameras. However, if a law enforcement
  4 18 agency uses body cameras, the bill sets out a process to retain
  4 19 the body camera data and to  provide access to the data.
  4 20    The bill provides as a general rule that a law enforcement
  4 21 agency that employs a peace officer whose body camera records
  4 22 body camera data shall retain the data for six months from the
  4 23 date it was recorded, after such time the body camera data
  4 24 shall be permanently deleted.
  4 25    The bill requires that body camera data shall be
  4 26 automatically retained for at least two years from the date
  4 27 of the recording under the following circumstances: the data
  4 28 involves any use of force; the data involves events leading
  4 29 up to and including an arrest or detention of a person; the
  4 30 data involves an encounter about which a formal or informal
  4 31 complaint has been registered; the peace officer whose body
  4 32 camera recorded the data voluntarily requests retention if
  4 33 that officer reasonably asserts the data has evidentiary or
  4 34 exculpatory value; a peace officer, who is a subject of the
  4 35 data recorded by another peace officer's body camera, and who
  5  1 voluntarily requests retention, if that officer reasonably
  5  2 asserts that the data has evidentiary or exculpatory value;
  5  3 a superior peace officer who requests retention of data if
  5  4 that superior peace officer reasonably asserts that the data
  5  5 has evidentiary or exculpatory value; a peace officer who
  5  6 voluntarily requests retention if the data is being retained
  5  7 solely and exclusively for law enforcement training purposes;
  5  8 a member of the public who is a subject of the data who
  5  9 voluntarily requests retention; a parent or legal guardian of
  5 10 a minor who is a subject of the data who voluntarily requests
  5 11 retention; or a deceased person's immediate family member or
  5 12 legally authorized designee who voluntarily requests retention.
  5 13    The bill specifies that body camera data involving any use of
  5 14 force by a peace officer shall be a public record and shall not
  5 15 be exempt from public examination.
  5 16    The bill provides that the following persons may examine,
  5 17 obtain a copy of, and disseminate body camera data: a person
  5 18 who is a subject of the data or the person's attorney; a parent
  5 19 or legal guardian of a person who is a minor who is a subject
  5 20 of the data, or the attorney for the parent or legal guardian;
  5 21 the immediate family member or legally authorized designee of a
  5 22 deceased person who is a subject of the data, or the attorney
  5 23 for the immediate family member or legally authorized designee;
  5 24 any other person seeking data, if the person who is a subject
  5 25 of the data, or the attorney for the person who is a subject of
  5 26 the data, has given written authority to the law enforcement
  5 27 agency to disclose the data to that other person, unless the
  5 28 subject of the data is a minor; any other person seeking data,
  5 29 if the parent or legal guardian of a minor who is a subject of
  5 30 the data, or the attorney for the parent or legal guardian,
  5 31 has given written authority to the law enforcement agency to
  5 32 disclose the data to that other person; or any other person
  5 33 seeking data of a deceased person who is a subject of the data,
  5 34 if the immediate family member or legally authorized designee
  5 35 of the deceased person, or the attorney for the immediate
  6  1 family member or legally authorized designee, has given written
  6  2 authority to the law enforcement agency to disclose the data to
  6  3 that other person.
  6  4    The bill prohibits a peace officer from reviewing or
  6  5 receiving an accounting of any body camera data that involves
  6  6 any use of force and is subject to a minimum two=year retention
  6  7 period under the bill, prior to completing any required initial
  6  8 reports, statements, and interviews regarding the recorded
  6  9 event.
  6 10    The bill prohibits a law enforcement agency from using or
  6 11 divulging body camera data for commercial or other non=law
  6 12 enforcement purposes.
  6 13    The bill allows a law enforcement agency to authorize a third
  6 14 party to act as its agent in maintaining body camera data,
  6 15 provided that the agent shall not be permitted to independently
  6 16 examine or alter any data, except to delete data as required by
  6 17 law or agency retention policies.
  6 18    The bill specifies that any member of the public who
  6 19 is a subject of the body camera data, the parent or legal
  6 20 guardian of a minor who is a subject of body camera data, or a
  6 21 deceased person's immediate family member or legally authorized
  6 22 designee, shall be permitted to review that specific body
  6 23 camera data in order to make a determination as to whether to
  6 24 voluntarily request that the body camera data be subject to a
  6 25 two=year retention period under the bill.
  6 26    The bill may include a state mandate as defined in Code
  6 27 section 25B.3.  The bill makes inapplicable Code section 25B.2,
  6 28 subsection 3, which would relieve a political subdivision from
  6 29 complying with a state mandate if funding for the cost of
  6 30 the state mandate is not provided or specified.  Therefore,
  6 31 political subdivisions are required to comply with any state
  6 32 mandate included in the bill.

  4 16    The bill does not require a law enforcement agency or peace
  4 17 officers to use body cameras. However, if a law enforcement
  4 18 agency uses body cameras, the bill sets out a process to retain

  5  1 voluntarily requests retention, if that officer reasonably
  5  2 asserts that the data has evidentiary or exculpatory value;

  5 31 has given written authority to the law enforcement agency to
  5 32 disclose the data to that other person; or any other person

  4  5 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  4  6 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  4  7    This bill relates to access to and retention of peace officer
  4  8 body camera data.
  4  9    The bill defines "body camera" to mean an electronic device
  4 10 that is capable of recording video and audio data or capable of
  4 11 transmitting video or audio data to be recorded remotely, and
  4 12 is worn on the person of a peace officer.
  4 13    The bill defines "peace officer" to mean a peace officer
  4 14 defined in Code section 801.4(11)(a), (b), (c), (f), (g), (h),
  4 15 or (i), which excludes a parole or probation officer.
  4 16    The bill does not require a law enforcement agency or peace
  4 17 officers to use body cameras. However, if a law enforcement
  4 18 agency uses body cameras, the bill sets out a process to retain
  4 19 the body camera data and to  provide access to the data.
  4 20    The bill provides as a general rule that a law enforcement
  4 21 agency that employs a peace officer whose body camera records
  4 22 body camera data shall retain the data for six months from the
  4 23 date it was recorded, after such time the body camera data
  4 24 shall be permanently deleted.
  4 25    The bill requires that body camera data shall be
  4 26 automatically retained for at least two years from the date
  4 27 of the recording under the following circumstances: the data
  4 28 involves any use of force; the data involves events leading
  4 29 up to and including an arrest or detention of a person; the
  4 30 data involves an encounter about which a formal or informal
  4 31 complaint has been registered; the peace officer whose body
  4 32 camera recorded the data voluntarily requests retention if
  4 33 that officer reasonably asserts the data has evidentiary or
  4 34 exculpatory value; a peace officer, who is a subject of the
  4 35 data recorded by another peace officer's body camera, and who
  5  1 voluntarily requests retention, if that officer reasonably
  5  2 asserts that the data has evidentiary or exculpatory value;
  5  3 a superior peace officer who requests retention of data if
  5  4 that superior peace officer reasonably asserts that the data
  5  5 has evidentiary or exculpatory value; a peace officer who
  5  6 voluntarily requests retention if the data is being retained
  5  7 solely and exclusively for law enforcement training purposes;
  5  8 a member of the public who is a subject of the data who
  5  9 voluntarily requests retention; a parent or legal guardian of
  5 10 a minor who is a subject of the data who voluntarily requests
  5 11 retention; or a deceased person's immediate family member or
  5 12 legally authorized designee who voluntarily requests retention.
  5 13    The bill specifies that body camera data involving any use of
  5 14 force by a peace officer shall be a public record and shall not
  5 15 be exempt from public examination.
  5 16    The bill provides that the following persons may examine,
  5 17 obtain a copy of, and disseminate body camera data: a person
  5 18 who is a subject of the data or the person's attorney; a parent
  5 19 or legal guardian of a person who is a minor who is a subject
  5 20 of the data, or the attorney for the parent or legal guardian;
  5 21 the immediate family member or legally authorized designee of a
  5 22 deceased person who is a subject of the data, or the attorney
  5 23 for the immediate family member or legally authorized designee;
  5 24 any other person seeking data, if the person who is a subject
  5 25 of the data, or the attorney for the person who is a subject of
  5 26 the data, has given written authority to the law enforcement
  5 27 agency to disclose the data to that other person, unless the
  5 28 subject of the data is a minor; any other person seeking data,
  5 29 if the parent or legal guardian of a minor who is a subject of
  5 30 the data, or the attorney for the parent or legal guardian,
  5 31 has given written authority to the law enforcement agency to
  5 32 disclose the data to that other person; or any other person
  5 33 seeking data of a deceased person who is a subject of the data,
  5 34 if the immediate family member or legally authorized designee
  5 35 of the deceased person, or the attorney for the immediate
  6  1 family member or legally authorized designee, has given written
  6  2 authority to the law enforcement agency to disclose the data to
  6  3 that other person.
  6  4    The bill prohibits a peace officer from reviewing or
  6  5 receiving an accounting of any body camera data that involves
  6  6 any use of force and is subject to a minimum two=year retention
  6  7 period under the bill, prior to completing any required initial
  6  8 reports, statements, and interviews regarding the recorded
  6  9 event.
  6 10    The bill prohibits a law enforcement agency from using or
  6 11 divulging body camera data for commercial or other non=law
  6 12 enforcement purposes.
  6 13    The bill allows a law enforcement agency to authorize a third
  6 14 party to act as its agent in maintaining body camera data,
  6 15 provided that the agent shall not be permitted to independently
  6 16 examine or alter any data, except to delete data as required by
  6 17 law or agency retention policies.
  6 18    The bill specifies that any member of the public who
  6 19 is a subject of the body camera data, the parent or legal
  6 20 guardian of a minor who is a subject of body camera data, or a
  6 21 deceased person's immediate family member or legally authorized
  6 22 designee, shall be permitted to review that specific body
  6 23 camera data in order to make a determination as to whether to
  6 24 voluntarily request that the body camera data be subject to a
  6 25 two=year retention period under the bill.
  6 26    The bill may include a state mandate as defined in Code
  6 27 section 25B.3.  The bill makes inapplicable Code section 25B.2,
  6 28 subsection 3, which would relieve a political subdivision from
  6 29 complying with a state mandate if funding for the cost of
  6 30 the state mandate is not provided or specified.  Therefore,
  6 31 political subdivisions are required to comply with any state
  6 32 mandate included in the bill.

  4  6 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  4  7    This bill relates to access to and retention of peace officer
  4  8 body camera data.
  4  9    The bill defines "body camera" to mean an electronic device
  4 10 that is capable of recording video and audio data or capable of
  4 11 transmitting video or audio data to be recorded remotely, and
  4 12 is worn on the person of a peace officer.
  4 13    The bill defines "peace officer" to mean a peace officer
  4 14 defined in Code section 801.4(11)(a), (b), (c), (f), (g), (h),
  4 15 or (i), which excludes a parole or probation officer.
  4 16    The bill does not require a law enforcement agency or peace
  4 17 officers to use body cameras. However, if a law enforcement
  4 18 agency uses body cameras, the bill sets out a process to retain
  4 19 the body camera data and to  provide access to the data.
  4 20    The bill provides as a general rule that a law enforcement
  4 21 agency that employs a peace officer whose body camera records
  4 22 body camera data shall retain the data for six months from the
  4 23 date it was recorded, after such time the body camera data

  4 27 of the recording under the following circumstances: the data
  4 28 involves any use of force; the data involves events leading
  4 29 up to and including an arrest or detention of a person; the
  4 30 data involves an encounter about which a formal or informal
  4 31 complaint has been registered; the peace officer whose body
  4 32 camera recorded the data voluntarily requests retention if
  4 33 that officer reasonably asserts the data has evidentiary or
  4 34 exculpatory value; a peace officer, who is a subject of the
  4 35 data recorded by another peace officer's body camera, and who
  5  1 voluntarily requests retention, if that officer reasonably
  5  2 asserts that the data has evidentiary or exculpatory value;
  5  3 a superior peace officer who requests retention of data if
  5  4 that superior peace officer reasonably asserts that the data
  5  5 has evidentiary or exculpatory value; a peace officer who
  5  6 voluntarily requests retention if the data is being retained
  5  7 solely and exclusively for law enforcement training purposes;
  5  8 a member of the public who is a subject of the data who
  5  9 voluntarily requests retention; a parent or legal guardian of
  5 10 a minor who is a subject of the data who voluntarily requests
  5 11 retention; or a deceased person's immediate family member or
  5 12 legally authorized designee who voluntarily requests retention.
  5 13    The bill specifies that body camera data involving any use of
  5 14 force by a peace officer shall be a public record and shall not
  5 15 be exempt from public examination.
  5 16    The bill provides that the following persons may examine,
  5 17 obtain a copy of, and disseminate body camera data: a person
  5 18 who is a subject of the data or the person's attorney; a parent

  5 25 of the data, or the attorney for the person who is a subject of
  5 26 the data, has given written authority to the law enforcement
  5 27 agency to disclose the data to that other person, unless the
  5 28 subject of the data is a minor; any other person seeking data,
  5 29 if the parent or legal guardian of a minor who is a subject of
  5 30 the data, or the attorney for the parent or legal guardian,
  5 31 has given written authority to the law enforcement agency to
  5 32 disclose the data to that other person; or any other person
  5 33 seeking data of a deceased person who is a subject of the data,

  5 35 of the deceased person, or the attorney for the immediate
  6  1 family member or legally authorized designee, has given written
  6  2 authority to the law enforcement agency to disclose the data to
  6  3 that other person.
  6  4    The bill prohibits a peace officer from reviewing or

  6 15 provided that the agent shall not be permitted to independently
  6 16 examine or alter any data, except to delete data as required by
  6 17 law or agency retention policies.

  6 26    The bill may include a state mandate as defined in Code
  6 27 section 25B.3.  The bill makes inapplicable Code section 25B.2,
  6 28 subsection 3, which would relieve a political subdivision from
  6 29 complying with a state mandate if funding for the cost of
  6 30 the state mandate is not provided or specified.  Therefore,
  6 31 political subdivisions are required to comply with any state
  6 32 mandate included in the bill.

  4  8 body camera data.
  4  9    The bill defines "body camera" to mean an electronic device
  4 10 that is capable of recording video and audio data or capable of
  4 11 transmitting video or audio data to be recorded remotely, and
  4 12 is worn on the person of a peace officer.

  4 16    The bill does not require a law enforcement agency or peace
  4 17 officers to use body cameras. However, if a law enforcement
  4 18 agency uses body cameras, the bill sets out a process to retain
  4 19 the body camera data and to  provide access to the data.
  4 20    The bill provides as a general rule that a law enforcement
  4 21 agency that employs a peace officer whose body camera records
  4 22 body camera data shall retain the data for six months from the
  4 23 date it was recorded, after such time the body camera data
  4 24 shall be permanently deleted.
  4 25    The bill requires that body camera data shall be
  4 26 automatically retained for at least two years from the date
  4 27 of the recording under the following circumstances: the data
  4 28 involves any use of force; the data involves events leading
  4 29 up to and including an arrest or detention of a person; the
  4 30 data involves an encounter about which a formal or informal
  4 31 complaint has been registered; the peace officer whose body
  4 32 camera recorded the data voluntarily requests retention if
  4 33 that officer reasonably asserts the data has evidentiary or
  4 34 exculpatory value; a peace officer, who is a subject of the
  4 35 data recorded by another peace officer's body camera, and who
  5  1 voluntarily requests retention, if that officer reasonably
  5  2 asserts that the data has evidentiary or exculpatory value;
  5  3 a superior peace officer who requests retention of data if
  5  4 that superior peace officer reasonably asserts that the data
  5  5 has evidentiary or exculpatory value; a peace officer who
  5  6 voluntarily requests retention if the data is being retained
  5  7 solely and exclusively for law enforcement training purposes;
  5  8 a member of the public who is a subject of the data who

  5 10 a minor who is a subject of the data who voluntarily requests
  5 11 retention; or a deceased person's immediate family member or
  5 12 legally authorized designee who voluntarily requests retention.
  5 13    The bill specifies that body camera data involving any use of
  5 14 force by a peace officer shall be a public record and shall not
  5 15 be exempt from public examination.
  5 16    The bill provides that the following persons may examine,
  5 17 obtain a copy of, and disseminate body camera data: a person
  5 18 who is a subject of the data or the person's attorney; a parent
  5 19 or legal guardian of a person who is a minor who is a subject
  5 20 of the data, or the attorney for the parent or legal guardian;
  5 21 the immediate family member or legally authorized designee of a
  5 22 deceased person who is a subject of the data, or the attorney
  5 23 for the immediate family member or legally authorized designee;
  5 24 any other person seeking data, if the person who is a subject
  5 25 of the data, or the attorney for the person who is a subject of
  5 26 the data, has given written authority to the law enforcement
  5 27 agency to disclose the data to that other person, unless the
  5 28 subject of the data is a minor; any other person seeking data,
  5 29 if the parent or legal guardian of a minor who is a subject of
  5 30 the data, or the attorney for the parent or legal guardian,
  5 31 has given written authority to the law enforcement agency to
  5 32 disclose the data to that other person; or any other person
  5 33 seeking data of a deceased person who is a subject of the data,
  5 34 if the immediate family member or legally authorized designee
  5 35 of the deceased person, or the attorney for the immediate
  6  1 family member or legally authorized designee, has given written
  6  2 authority to the law enforcement agency to disclose the data to
  6  3 that other person.
  6  4    The bill prohibits a peace officer from reviewing or
  6  5 receiving an accounting of any body camera data that involves
  6  6 any use of force and is subject to a minimum two=year retention
  6  7 period under the bill, prior to completing any required initial
  6  8 reports, statements, and interviews regarding the recorded
  6  9 event.
  6 10    The bill prohibits a law enforcement agency from using or
  6 11 divulging body camera data for commercial or other non=law
  6 12 enforcement purposes.
  6 13    The bill allows a law enforcement agency to authorize a third
  6 14 party to act as its agent in maintaining body camera data,
  6 15 provided that the agent shall not be permitted to independently
  6 16 examine or alter any data, except to delete data as required by
  6 17 law or agency retention policies.
  6 18    The bill specifies that any member of the public who
  6 19 is a subject of the body camera data, the parent or legal
  6 20 guardian of a minor who is a subject of body camera data, or a
  6 21 deceased person's immediate family member or legally authorized
  6 22 designee, shall be permitted to review that specific body
  6 23 camera data in order to make a determination as to whether to
  6 24 voluntarily request that the body camera data be subject to a
  6 25 two=year retention period under the bill.
  6 26    The bill may include a state mandate as defined in Code
  6 27 section 25B.3.  The bill makes inapplicable Code section 25B.2,
  6 28 subsection 3, which would relieve a political subdivision from
  6 29 complying with a state mandate if funding for the cost of
  6 30 the state mandate is not provided or specified.  Therefore,

  4  4                           EXPLANATION
  4  5 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  4  6 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  4  7    This bill relates to access to and retention of peace officer
  4  8 body camera data.
  4  9    The bill defines "body camera" to mean an electronic device
  4 10 that is capable of recording video and audio data or capable of
  4 11 transmitting video or audio data to be recorded remotely, and
  4 12 is worn on the person of a peace officer.
  4 13    The bill defines "peace officer" to mean a peace officer
  4 14 defined in Code section 801.4(11)(a), (b), (c), (f), (g), (h),
  4 15 or (i), which excludes a parole or probation officer.
  4 16    The bill does not require a law enforcement agency or peace
  4 17 officers to use body cameras. However, if a law enforcement
  4 18 agency uses body cameras, the bill sets out a process to retain
  4 19 the body camera data and to  provide access to the data.
  4 20    The bill provides as a general rule that a law enforcement
  4 21 agency that employs a peace officer whose body camera records
  4 22 body camera data shall retain the data for six months from the
  4 23 date it was recorded, after such time the body camera data
  4 24 shall be permanently deleted.
  4 25    The bill requires that body camera data shall be
  4 26 automatically retained for at least two years from the date
  4 27 of the recording under the following circumstances: the data
  4 28 involves any use of force; the data involves events leading
  4 29 up to and including an arrest or detention of a person; the
  4 30 data involves an encounter about which a formal or informal
  4 31 complaint has been registered; the peace officer whose body
  4 32 camera recorded the data voluntarily requests retention if
  4 33 that officer reasonably asserts the data has evidentiary or
  4 34 exculpatory value; a peace officer, who is a subject of the
  4 35 data recorded by another peace officer's body camera, and who
  5  1 voluntarily requests retention, if that officer reasonably
  5  2 asserts that the data has evidentiary or exculpatory value;
  5  3 a superior peace officer who requests retention of data if
  5  4 that superior peace officer reasonably asserts that the data
  5  5 has evidentiary or exculpatory value; a peace officer who
  5  6 voluntarily requests retention if the data is being retained
  5  7 solely and exclusively for law enforcement training purposes;
  5  8 a member of the public who is a subject of the data who
  5  9 voluntarily requests retention; a parent or legal guardian of
  5 10 a minor who is a subject of the data who voluntarily requests
  5 11 retention; or a deceased person's immediate family member or
  5 12 legally authorized designee who voluntarily requests retention.
  5 13    The bill specifies that body camera data involving any use of
  5 14 force by a peace officer shall be a public record and shall not
  5 15 be exempt from public examination.
  5 16    The bill provides that the following persons may examine,
  5 17 obtain a copy of, and disseminate body camera data: a person
  5 18 who is a subject of the data or the person's attorney; a parent
  5 19 or legal guardian of a person who is a minor who is a subject
  5 20 of the data, or the attorney for the parent or legal guardian;
  5 21 the immediate family member or legally authorized designee of a
  5 22 deceased person who is a subject of the data, or the attorney
  5 23 for the immediate family member or legally authorized designee;
  5 24 any other person seeking data, if the person who is a subject
  5 25 of the data, or the attorney for the person who is a subject of
  5 26 the data, has given written authority to the law enforcement
  5 27 agency to disclose the data to that other person, unless the
  5 28 subject of the data is a minor; any other person seeking data,
  5 29 if the parent or legal guardian of a minor who is a subject of
  5 30 the data, or the attorney for the parent or legal guardian,
  5 31 has given written authority to the law enforcement agency to
  5 32 disclose the data to that other person; or any other person
  5 33 seeking data of a deceased person who is a subject of the data,
  5 34 if the immediate family member or legally authorized designee
  5 35 of the deceased person, or the attorney for the immediate
  6  1 family member or legally authorized designee, has given written
  6  2 authority to the law enforcement agency to disclose the data to
  6  3 that other person.
  6  4    The bill prohibits a peace officer from reviewing or
  6  5 receiving an accounting of any body camera data that involves
  6  6 any use of force and is subject to a minimum two=year retention
  6  7 period under the bill, prior to completing any required initial
  6  8 reports, statements, and interviews regarding the recorded
  6  9 event.
  6 10    The bill prohibits a law enforcement agency from using or
  6 11 divulging body camera data for commercial or other non=law
  6 12 enforcement purposes.
  6 13    The bill allows a law enforcement agency to authorize a third
  6 14 party to act as its agent in maintaining body camera data,
  6 15 provided that the agent shall not be permitted to independently
  6 16 examine or alter any data, except to delete data as required by
  6 17 law or agency retention policies.
  6 18    The bill specifies that any member of the public who
  6 19 is a subject of the body camera data, the parent or legal
  6 20 guardian of a minor who is a subject of body camera data, or a
  6 21 deceased person's immediate family member or legally authorized
  6 22 designee, shall be permitted to review that specific body
  6 23 camera data in order to make a determination as to whether to
  6 24 voluntarily request that the body camera data be subject to a
  6 25 two=year retention period under the bill.
  6 26    The bill may include a state mandate as defined in Code
  6 27 section 25B.3.  The bill makes inapplicable Code section 25B.2,
  6 28 subsection 3, which would relieve a political subdivision from
  6 29 complying with a state mandate if funding for the cost of
  6 30 the state mandate is not provided or specified.  Therefore,
  6 31 political subdivisions are required to comply with any state
  6 32 mandate included in the bill.

  4  4                           EXPLANATION
  4  5 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  4  6 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  4  7    This bill relates to access to and retention of peace officer
  4  8 body camera data.
  4  9    The bill defines "body camera" to mean an electronic device
  4 10 that is capable of recording video and audio data or capable of
  4 11 transmitting video or audio data to be recorded remotely, and
  4 12 is worn on the person of a peace officer.
  4 13    The bill defines "peace officer" to mean a peace officer
  4 14 defined in Code section 801.4(11)(a), (b), (c), (f), (g), (h),
  4 15 or (i), which excludes a parole or probation officer.
  4 16    The bill does not require a law enforcement agency or peace
  4 17 officers to use body cameras. However, if a law enforcement
  4 18 agency uses body cameras, the bill sets out a process to retain
  4 19 the body camera data and to  provide access to the data.
  4 20    The bill provides as a general rule that a law enforcement
  4 21 agency that employs a peace officer whose body camera records
  4 22 body camera data shall retain the data for six months from the
  4 23 date it was recorded, after such time the body camera data
  4 24 shall be permanently deleted.
  4 25    The bill requires that body camera data shall be
  4 26 automatically retained for at least two years from the date
  4 27 of the recording under the following circumstances: the data
  4 28 involves any use of force; the data involves events leading
  4 29 up to and including an arrest or detention of a person; the
  4 30 data involves an encounter about which a formal or informal
  4 31 complaint has been registered; the peace officer whose body
  4 32 camera recorded the data voluntarily requests retention if
  4 33 that officer reasonably asserts the data has evidentiary or
  4 34 exculpatory value; a peace officer, who is a subject of the
  4 35 data recorded by another peace officer's body camera, and who
  5  1 voluntarily requests retention, if that officer reasonably
  5  2 asserts that the data has evidentiary or exculpatory value;
  5  3 a superior peace officer who requests retention of data if
  5  4 that superior peace officer reasonably asserts that the data
  5  5 has evidentiary or exculpatory value; a peace officer who
  5  6 voluntarily requests retention if the data is being retained
  5  7 solely and exclusively for law enforcement training purposes;
  5  8 a member of the public who is a subject of the data who
  5  9 voluntarily requests retention; a parent or legal guardian of
  5 10 a minor who is a subject of the data who voluntarily requests
  5 11 retention; or a deceased person's immediate family member or
  5 12 legally authorized designee who voluntarily requests retention.
  5 13    The bill specifies that body camera data involving any use of
  5 14 force by a peace officer shall be a public record and shall not
  5 15 be exempt from public examination.
  5 16    The bill provides that the following persons may examine,
  5 17 obtain a copy of, and disseminate body camera data: a person
  5 18 who is a subject of the data or the person's attorney; a parent
  5 19 or legal guardian of a person who is a minor who is a subject
  5 20 of the data, or the attorney for the parent or legal guardian;
  5 21 the immediate family member or legally authorized designee of a
  5 22 deceased person who is a subject of the data, or the attorney
  5 23 for the immediate family member or legally authorized designee;
  5 24 any other person seeking data, if the person who is a subject
  5 25 of the data, or the attorney for the person who is a subject of
  5 26 the data, has given written authority to the law enforcement
  5 27 agency to disclose the data to that other person, unless the
  5 28 subject of the data is a minor; any other person seeking data,
  5 29 if the parent or legal guardian of a minor who is a subject of
  5 30 the data, or the attorney for the parent or legal guardian,
  5 31 has given written authority to the law enforcement agency to
  5 32 disclose the data to that other person; or any other person
  5 33 seeking data of a deceased person who is a subject of the data,
  5 34 if the immediate family member or legally authorized designee
  5 35 of the deceased person, or the attorney for the immediate
  6  1 family member or legally authorized designee, has given written
  6  2 authority to the law enforcement agency to disclose the data to
  6  3 that other person.
  6  4    The bill prohibits a peace officer from reviewing or
  6  5 receiving an accounting of any body camera data that involves
  6  6 any use of force and is subject to a minimum two=year retention
  6  7 period under the bill, prior to completing any required initial
  6  8 reports, statements, and interviews regarding the recorded
  6  9 event.
  6 10    The bill prohibits a law enforcement agency from using or
  6 11 divulging body camera data for commercial or other non=law
  6 12 enforcement purposes.
  6 13    The bill allows a law enforcement agency to authorize a third
  6 14 party to act as its agent in maintaining body camera data,
  6 15 provided that the agent shall not be permitted to independently
  6 16 examine or alter any data, except to delete data as required by
  6 17 law or agency retention policies.
  6 18    The bill specifies that any member of the public who
  6 19 is a subject of the body camera data, the parent or legal
  6 20 guardian of a minor who is a subject of body camera data, or a
  6 21 deceased person's immediate family member or legally authorized
  6 22 designee, shall be permitted to review that specific body
  6 23 camera data in order to make a determination as to whether to
  6 24 voluntarily request that the body camera data be subject to a
  6 25 two=year retention period under the bill.
  6 26    The bill may include a state mandate as defined in Code
  6 27 section 25B.3.  The bill makes inapplicable Code section 25B.2,
  6 28 subsection 3, which would relieve a political subdivision from
  6 29 complying with a state mandate if funding for the cost of
  6 30 the state mandate is not provided or specified.  Therefore,
  6 31 political subdivisions are required to comply with any state
  6 32 mandate included in the bill.

  4  4                           EXPLANATION
  4  5 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  4  6 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  4  7    This bill relates to access to and retention of peace officer
  4  8 body camera data.
  4  9    The bill defines "body camera" to mean an electronic device
  4 10 that is capable of recording video and audio data or capable of
  4 11 transmitting video or audio data to be recorded remotely, and
  4 12 is worn on the person of a peace officer.
  4 13    The bill defines "peace officer" to mean a peace officer
  4 14 defined in Code section 801.4(11)(a), (b), (c), (f), (g), (h),
  4 15 or (i), which excludes a parole or probation officer.
  4 16    The bill does not require a law enforcement agency or peace
  4 17 officers to use body cameras. However, if a law enforcement
  4 18 agency uses body cameras, the bill sets out a process to retain
  4 19 the body camera data and to  provide access to the data.
  4 20    The bill provides as a general rule that a law enforcement
  4 21 agency that employs a peace officer whose body camera records
  4 22 body camera data shall retain the data for six months from the
  4 23 date it was recorded, after such time the body camera data
  4 24 shall be permanently deleted.
  4 25    The bill requires that body camera data shall be
  4 26 automatically retained for at least two years from the date
  4 27 of the recording under the following circumstances: the data
  4 28 involves any use of force; the data involves events leading
  4 29 up to and including an arrest or detention of a person; the
  4 30 data involves an encounter about which a formal or informal
  4 31 complaint has been registered; the peace officer whose body
  4 32 camera recorded the data voluntarily requests retention if
  4 33 that officer reasonably asserts the data has evidentiary or
  4 34 exculpatory value; a peace officer, who is a subject of the
  4 35 data recorded by another peace officer's body camera, and who
  5  1 voluntarily requests retention, if that officer reasonably
  5  2 asserts that the data has evidentiary or exculpatory value;
  5  3 a superior peace officer who requests retention of data if
  5  4 that superior peace officer reasonably asserts that the data
  5  5 has evidentiary or exculpatory value; a peace officer who
  5  6 voluntarily requests retention if the data is being retained
  5  7 solely and exclusively for law enforcement training purposes;
  5  8 a member of the public who is a subject of the data who
  5  9 voluntarily requests retention; a parent or legal guardian of
  5 10 a minor who is a subject of the data who voluntarily requests
  5 11 retention; or a deceased person's immediate family member or
  5 12 legally authorized designee who voluntarily requests retention.
  5 13    The bill specifies that body camera data involving any use of
  5 14 force by a peace officer shall be a public record and shall not
  5 15 be exempt from public examination.
  5 16    The bill provides that the following persons may examine,
  5 17 obtain a copy of, and disseminate body camera data: a person
  5 18 who is a subject of the data or the person's attorney; a parent
  5 19 or legal guardian of a person who is a minor who is a subject
  5 20 of the data, or the attorney for the parent or legal guardian;
  5 21 the immediate family member or legally authorized designee of a
  5 22 deceased person who is a subject of the data, or the attorney
  5 23 for the immediate family member or legally authorized designee;
  5 24 any other person seeking data, if the person who is a subject
  5 25 of the data, or the attorney for the person who is a subject of
  5 26 the data, has given written authority to the law enforcement
  5 27 agency to disclose the data to that other person, unless the
  5 28 subject of the data is a minor; any other person seeking data,
  5 29 if the parent or legal guardian of a minor who is a subject of
  5 30 the data, or the attorney for the parent or legal guardian,
  5 31 has given written authority to the law enforcement agency to
  5 32 disclose the data to that other person; or any other person
  5 33 seeking data of a deceased person who is a subject of the data,
  5 34 if the immediate family member or legally authorized designee
  5 35 of the deceased person, or the attorney for the immediate
  6  1 family member or legally authorized designee, has given written
  6  2 authority to the law enforcement agency to disclose the data to
  6  3 that other person.
  6  4    The bill prohibits a peace officer from reviewing or
  6  5 receiving an accounting of any body camera data that involves
  6  6 any use of force and is subject to a minimum two=year retention
  6  7 period under the bill, prior to completing any required initial
  6  8 reports, statements, and interviews regarding the recorded
  6  9 event.
  6 10    The bill prohibits a law enforcement agency from using or
  6 11 divulging body camera data for commercial or other non=law
  6 12 enforcement purposes.
  6 13    The bill allows a law enforcement agency to authorize a third
  6 14 party to act as its agent in maintaining body camera data,
  6 15 provided that the agent shall not be permitted to independently
  6 16 examine or alter any data, except to delete data as required by
  6 17 law or agency retention policies.
  6 18    The bill specifies that any member of the public who
  6 19 is a subject of the body camera data, the parent or legal
  6 20 guardian of a minor who is a subject of body camera data, or a
  6 21 deceased person's immediate family member or legally authorized
  6 22 designee, shall be permitted to review that specific body
  6 23 camera data in order to make a determination as to whether to
  6 24 voluntarily request that the body camera data be subject to a
  6 25 two=year retention period under the bill.
  6 26    The bill may include a state mandate as defined in Code
  6 27 section 25B.3.  The bill makes inapplicable Code section 25B.2,
  6 28 subsection 3, which would relieve a political subdivision from
  6 29 complying with a state mandate if funding for the cost of
  6 30 the state mandate is not provided or specified.  Therefore,
  6 31 political subdivisions are required to comply with any state
  6 32 mandate included in the bill.

  4 18 agency uses body cameras, the bill sets out a process to retain
  4 19 the body camera data and to  provide access to the data.
  4 20    The bill provides as a general rule that a law enforcement
  4 21 agency that employs a peace officer whose body camera records
  4 22 body camera data shall retain the data for six months from the
  4 23 date it was recorded, after such time the body camera data
  4 24 shall be permanently deleted.
  4 25    The bill requires that body camera data shall be
  4 26 automatically retained for at least two years from the date
  4 27 of the recording under the following circumstances: the data
  4 28 involves any use of force; the data involves events leading
  4 29 up to and including an arrest or detention of a person; the
  4 30 data involves an encounter about which a formal or informal
  4 31 complaint has been registered; the peace officer whose body
  4 32 camera recorded the data voluntarily requests retention if
  4 33 that officer reasonably asserts the data has evidentiary or
  4 34 exculpatory value; a peace officer, who is a subject of the
  4 35 data recorded by another peace officer's body camera, and who
  5  1 voluntarily requests retention, if that officer reasonably
  5  2 asserts that the data has evidentiary or exculpatory value;
  5  3 a superior peace officer who requests retention of data if
  5  4 that superior peace officer reasonably asserts that the data
  5  5 has evidentiary or exculpatory value; a peace officer who

  5 12 legally authorized designee who voluntarily requests retention.
  5 13    The bill specifies that body camera data involving any use of
  5 14 force by a peace officer shall be a public record and shall not
  5 15 be exempt from public examination.
  5 16    The bill provides that the following persons may examine,
  5 17 obtain a copy of, and disseminate body camera data: a person
  5 18 who is a subject of the data or the person's attorney; a parent
  5 19 or legal guardian of a person who is a minor who is a subject
  5 20 of the data, or the attorney for the parent or legal guardian;

  5 24 any other person seeking data, if the person who is a subject
  5 25 of the data, or the attorney for the person who is a subject of
  5 26 the data, has given written authority to the law enforcement
  5 27 agency to disclose the data to that other person, unless the
  5 28 subject of the data is a minor; any other person seeking data,
  5 29 if the parent or legal guardian of a minor who is a subject of
  5 30 the data, or the attorney for the parent or legal guardian,
  5 31 has given written authority to the law enforcement agency to
  5 32 disclose the data to that other person; or any other person
  5 33 seeking data of a deceased person who is a subject of the data,
  5 34 if the immediate family member or legally authorized designee
  5 35 of the deceased person, or the attorney for the immediate
  6  1 family member or legally authorized designee, has given written
  6  2 authority to the law enforcement agency to disclose the data to
  6  3 that other person.
  6  4    The bill prohibits a peace officer from reviewing or
  6  5 receiving an accounting of any body camera data that involves
  6  6 any use of force and is subject to a minimum two=year retention
  6  7 period under the bill, prior to completing any required initial
  6  8 reports, statements, and interviews regarding the recorded
  6  9 event.
  6 10    The bill prohibits a law enforcement agency from using or
  6 11 divulging body camera data for commercial or other non=law
  6 12 enforcement purposes.
  6 13    The bill allows a law enforcement agency to authorize a third
  6 14 party to act as its agent in maintaining body camera data,
  6 15 provided that the agent shall not be permitted to independently
  6 16 examine or alter any data, except to delete data as required by
  6 17 law or agency retention policies.
  6 18    The bill specifies that any member of the public who
  6 19 is a subject of the body camera data, the parent or legal
  6 20 guardian of a minor who is a subject of body camera data, or a
  6 21 deceased person's immediate family member or legally authorized
  6 22 designee, shall be permitted to review that specific body
  6 23 camera data in order to make a determination as to whether to
  6 24 voluntarily request that the body camera data be subject to a
  6 25 two=year retention period under the bill.
  6 26    The bill may include a state mandate as defined in Code
  6 27 section 25B.3.  The bill makes inapplicable Code section 25B.2,
  6 28 subsection 3, which would relieve a political subdivision from
  6 29 complying with a state mandate if funding for the cost of
  6 30 the state mandate is not provided or specified.  Therefore,
  6 31 political subdivisions are required to comply with any state
  6 32 mandate included in the bill.

  4  5 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  4  6 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  4  7    This bill relates to access to and retention of peace officer
  4  8 body camera data.
  4  9    The bill defines "body camera" to mean an electronic device
  4 10 that is capable of recording video and audio data or capable of
  4 11 transmitting video or audio data to be recorded remotely, and
  4 12 is worn on the person of a peace officer.
  4 13    The bill defines "peace officer" to mean a peace officer
  4 14 defined in Code section 801.4(11)(a), (b), (c), (f), (g), (h),
  4 15 or (i), which excludes a parole or probation officer.
  4 16    The bill does not require a law enforcement agency or peace
  4 17 officers to use body cameras. However, if a law enforcement
  4 18 agency uses body cameras, the bill sets out a process to retain
  4 19 the body camera data and to  provide access to the data.
  4 20    The bill provides as a general rule that a law enforcement
  4 21 agency that employs a peace officer whose body camera records
  4 22 body camera data shall retain the data for six months from the
  4 23 date it was recorded, after such time the body camera data
  4 24 shall be permanently deleted.
  4 25    The bill requires that body camera data shall be
  4 26 automatically retained for at least two years from the date
  4 27 of the recording under the following circumstances: the data
  4 28 involves any use of force; the data involves events leading
  4 29 up to and including an arrest or detention of a person; the
  4 30 data involves an encounter about which a formal or informal
  4 31 complaint has been registered; the peace officer whose body
  4 32 camera recorded the data voluntarily requests retention if
  4 33 that officer reasonably asserts the data has evidentiary or
  4 34 exculpatory value; a peace officer, who is a subject of the
  4 35 data recorded by another peace officer's body camera, and who
  5  1 voluntarily requests retention, if that officer reasonably
  5  2 asserts that the data has evidentiary or exculpatory value;
  5  3 a superior peace officer who requests retention of data if
  5  4 that superior peace officer reasonably asserts that the data
  5  5 has evidentiary or exculpatory value; a peace officer who
  5  6 voluntarily requests retention if the data is being retained
  5  7 solely and exclusively for law enforcement training purposes;
  5  8 a member of the public who is a subject of the data who
  5  9 voluntarily requests retention; a parent or legal guardian of
  5 10 a minor who is a subject of the data who voluntarily requests
  5 11 retention; or a deceased person's immediate family member or
  5 12 legally authorized designee who voluntarily requests retention.
  5 13    The bill specifies that body camera data involving any use of
  5 14 force by a peace officer shall be a public record and shall not
  5 15 be exempt from public examination.
  5 16    The bill provides that the following persons may examine,
  5 17 obtain a copy of, and disseminate body camera data: a person
  5 18 who is a subject of the data or the person's attorney; a parent
  5 19 or legal guardian of a person who is a minor who is a subject
  5 20 of the data, or the attorney for the parent or legal guardian;
  5 21 the immediate family member or legally authorized designee of a
  5 22 deceased person who is a subject of the data, or the attorney
  5 23 for the immediate family member or legally authorized designee;
  5 24 any other person seeking data, if the person who is a subject
  5 25 of the data, or the attorney for the person who is a subject of
  5 26 the data, has given written authority to the law enforcement
  5 27 agency to disclose the data to that other person, unless the
  5 28 subject of the data is a minor; any other person seeking data,
  5 29 if the parent or legal guardian of a minor who is a subject of
  5 30 the data, or the attorney for the parent or legal guardian,
  5 31 has given written authority to the law enforcement agency to
  5 32 disclose the data to that other person; or any other person
  5 33 seeking data of a deceased person who is a subject of the data,
  5 34 if the immediate family member or legally authorized designee
  5 35 of the deceased person, or the attorney for the immediate
  6  1 family member or legally authorized designee, has given written
  6  2 authority to the law enforcement agency to disclose the data to
  6  3 that other person.
  6  4    The bill prohibits a peace officer from reviewing or
  6  5 receiving an accounting of any body camera data that involves
  6  6 any use of force and is subject to a minimum two=year retention
  6  7 period under the bill, prior to completing any required initial
  6  8 reports, statements, and interviews regarding the recorded
  6  9 event.
  6 10    The bill prohibits a law enforcement agency from using or
  6 11 divulging body camera data for commercial or other non=law
  6 12 enforcement purposes.

  6 15 provided that the agent shall not be permitted to independently
  6 16 examine or alter any data, except to delete data as required by

  6 20 guardian of a minor who is a subject of body camera data, or a

  6 22 designee, shall be permitted to review that specific body
  6 23 camera data in order to make a determination as to whether to
  6 24 voluntarily request that the body camera data be subject to a

  4  4                           EXPLANATION
  4  5 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  4  6 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  4  7    This bill relates to access to and retention of peace officer
  4  8 body camera data.
  4  9    The bill defines "body camera" to mean an electronic device
  4 10 that is capable of recording video and audio data or capable of
  4 11 transmitting video or audio data to be recorded remotely, and
  4 12 is worn on the person of a peace officer.
  4 13    The bill defines "peace officer" to mean a peace officer
  4 14 defined in Code section 801.4(11)(a), (b), (c), (f), (g), (h),
  4 15 or (i), which excludes a parole or probation officer.
  4 16    The bill does not require a law enforcement agency or peace
  4 17 officers to use body cameras. However, if a law enforcement
  4 18 agency uses body cameras, the bill sets out a process to retain
  4 19 the body camera data and to  provide access to the data.
  4 20    The bill provides as a general rule that a law enforcement
  4 21 agency that employs a peace officer whose body camera records
  4 22 body camera data shall retain the data for six months from the
  4 23 date it was recorded, after such time the body camera data
  4 24 shall be permanently deleted.
  4 25    The bill requires that body camera data shall be
  4 26 automatically retained for at least two years from the date
  4 27 of the recording under the following circumstances: the data
  4 28 involves any use of force; the data involves events leading
  4 29 up to and including an arrest or detention of a person; the
  4 30 data involves an encounter about which a formal or informal
  4 31 complaint has been registered; the peace officer whose body
  4 32 camera recorded the data voluntarily requests retention if
  4 33 that officer reasonably asserts the data has evidentiary or
  4 34 exculpatory value; a peace officer, who is a subject of the
  4 35 data recorded by another peace officer's body camera, and who
  5  1 voluntarily requests retention, if that officer reasonably
  5  2 asserts that the data has evidentiary or exculpatory value;
  5  3 a superior peace officer who requests retention of data if
  5  4 that superior peace officer reasonably asserts that the data
  5  5 has evidentiary or exculpatory value; a peace officer who
  5  6 voluntarily requests retention if the data is being retained
  5  7 solely and exclusively for law enforcement training purposes;
  5  8 a member of the public who is a subject of the data who
  5  9 voluntarily requests retention; a parent or legal guardian of
  5 10 a minor who is a subject of the data who voluntarily requests
  5 11 retention; or a deceased person's immediate family member or
  5 12 legally authorized designee who voluntarily requests retention.
  5 13    The bill specifies that body camera data involving any use of
  5 14 force by a peace officer shall be a public record and shall not
  5 15 be exempt from public examination.
  5 16    The bill provides that the following persons may examine,
  5 17 obtain a copy of, and disseminate body camera data: a person
  5 18 who is a subject of the data or the person's attorney; a parent
  5 19 or legal guardian of a person who is a minor who is a subject
  5 20 of the data, or the attorney for the parent or legal guardian;
  5 21 the immediate family member or legally authorized designee of a
  5 22 deceased person who is a subject of the data, or the attorney
  5 23 for the immediate family member or legally authorized designee;
  5 24 any other person seeking data, if the person who is a subject
  5 25 of the data, or the attorney for the person who is a subject of
  5 26 the data, has given written authority to the law enforcement
  5 27 agency to disclose the data to that other person, unless the
  5 28 subject of the data is a minor; any other person seeking data,
  5 29 if the parent or legal guardian of a minor who is a subject of
  5 30 the data, or the attorney for the parent or legal guardian,
  5 31 has given written authority to the law enforcement agency to
  5 32 disclose the data to that other person; or any other person
  5 33 seeking data of a deceased person who is a subject of the data,
  5 34 if the immediate family member or legally authorized designee
  5 35 of the deceased person, or the attorney for the immediate
  6  1 family member or legally authorized designee, has given written
  6  2 authority to the law enforcement agency to disclose the data to
  6  3 that other person.
  6  4    The bill prohibits a peace officer from reviewing or
  6  5 receiving an accounting of any body camera data that involves
  6  6 any use of force and is subject to a minimum two=year retention
  6  7 period under the bill, prior to completing any required initial
  6  8 reports, statements, and interviews regarding the recorded
  6  9 event.
  6 10    The bill prohibits a law enforcement agency from using or
  6 11 divulging body camera data for commercial or other non=law
  6 12 enforcement purposes.
  6 13    The bill allows a law enforcement agency to authorize a third
  6 14 party to act as its agent in maintaining body camera data,
  6 15 provided that the agent shall not be permitted to independently
  6 16 examine or alter any data, except to delete data as required by
  6 17 law or agency retention policies.
  6 18    The bill specifies that any member of the public who
  6 19 is a subject of the body camera data, the parent or legal
  6 20 guardian of a minor who is a subject of body camera data, or a
  6 21 deceased person's immediate family member or legally authorized
  6 22 designee, shall be permitted to review that specific body
  6 23 camera data in order to make a determination as to whether to
  6 24 voluntarily request that the body camera data be subject to a
  6 25 two=year retention period under the bill.
  6 26    The bill may include a state mandate as defined in Code
  6 27 section 25B.3.  The bill makes inapplicable Code section 25B.2,
  6 28 subsection 3, which would relieve a political subdivision from
  6 29 complying with a state mandate if funding for the cost of
  6 30 the state mandate is not provided or specified.  Therefore,
  6 31 political subdivisions are required to comply with any state
  6 32 mandate included in the bill.

  3 23 subsection 2, prior to the peace officer's completion of any
  3 24 required initial reports, statements, and interviews regarding
  3 25 the recorded event.
  3 26    7.  A law enforcement agency shall not use or divulge body
  3 27 camera data for any commercial or other non=law enforcement
  3 28 purpose.
  3 29    8.  A law enforcement agency may authorize a third party to
  3 30 act as its agent in maintaining body camera data, provided that
  3 31 the agent shall not be permitted to independently examine or
  3 32 alter any data, except to delete data as required by law or
  3 33 agency retention policies.

  4  5 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  4  6 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  4  7    This bill relates to access to and retention of peace officer
  4  8 body camera data.
  4  9    The bill defines "body camera" to mean an electronic device
  4 10 that is capable of recording video and audio data or capable of
  4 11 transmitting video or audio data to be recorded remotely, and
  4 12 is worn on the person of a peace officer.
  4 13    The bill defines "peace officer" to mean a peace officer
  4 14 defined in Code section 801.4(11)(a), (b), (c), (f), (g), (h),
  4 15 or (i), which excludes a parole or probation officer.
  4 16    The bill does not require a law enforcement agency or peace
  4 17 officers to use body cameras. However, if a law enforcement
  4 18 agency uses body cameras, the bill sets out a process to retain
  4 19 the body camera data and to  provide access to the data.
  4 20    The bill provides as a general rule that a law enforcement
  4 21 agency that employs a peace officer whose body camera records
  4 22 body camera data shall retain the data for six months from the
  4 23 date it was recorded, after such time the body camera data
  4 24 shall be permanently deleted.
  4 25    The bill requires that body camera data shall be
  4 26 automatically retained for at least two years from the date
  4 27 of the recording under the following circumstances: the data
  4 28 involves any use of force; the data involves events leading
  4 29 up to and including an arrest or detention of a person; the
  4 30 data involves an encounter about which a formal or informal
  4 31 complaint has been registered; the peace officer whose body
  4 32 camera recorded the data voluntarily requests retention if
  4 33 that officer reasonably asserts the data has evidentiary or
  4 34 exculpatory value; a peace officer, who is a subject of the
  4 35 data recorded by another peace officer's body camera, and who
  5  1 voluntarily requests retention, if that officer reasonably
  5  2 asserts that the data has evidentiary or exculpatory value;
  5  3 a superior peace officer who requests retention of data if
  5  4 that superior peace officer reasonably asserts that the data
  5  5 has evidentiary or exculpatory value; a peace officer who
  5  6 voluntarily requests retention if the data is being retained
  5  7 solely and exclusively for law enforcement training purposes;
  5  8 a member of the public who is a subject of the data who
  5  9 voluntarily requests retention; a parent or legal guardian of
  5 10 a minor who is a subject of the data who voluntarily requests
  5 11 retention; or a deceased person's immediate family member or
  5 12 legally authorized designee who voluntarily requests retention.
  5 13    The bill specifies that body camera data involving any use of
  5 14 force by a peace officer shall be a public record and shall not
  5 15 be exempt from public examination.
  5 16    The bill provides that the following persons may examine,
  5 17 obtain a copy of, and disseminate body camera data: a person
  5 18 who is a subject of the data or the person's attorney; a parent
  5 19 or legal guardian of a person who is a minor who is a subject
  5 20 of the data, or the attorney for the parent or legal guardian;
  5 21 the immediate family member or legally authorized designee of a
  5 22 deceased person who is a subject of the data, or the attorney
  5 23 for the immediate family member or legally authorized designee;
  5 24 any other person seeking data, if the person who is a subject
  5 25 of the data, or the attorney for the person who is a subject of
  5 26 the data, has given written authority to the law enforcement
  5 27 agency to disclose the data to that other person, unless the
  5 28 subject of the data is a minor; any other person seeking data,
  5 29 if the parent or legal guardian of a minor who is a subject of
  5 30 the data, or the attorney for the parent or legal guardian,
  5 31 has given written authority to the law enforcement agency to
  5 32 disclose the data to that other person; or any other person
  5 33 seeking data of a deceased person who is a subject of the data,
  5 34 if the immediate family member or legally authorized designee
  5 35 of the deceased person, or the attorney for the immediate
  6  1 family member or legally authorized designee, has given written
  6  2 authority to the law enforcement agency to disclose the data to
  6  3 that other person.
  6  4    The bill prohibits a peace officer from reviewing or

  4 17 officers to use body cameras. However, if a law enforcement
  4 18 agency uses body cameras, the bill sets out a process to retain
  4 19 the body camera data and to  provide access to the data.
  4 20    The bill provides as a general rule that a law enforcement
  4 21 agency that employs a peace officer whose body camera records

  5 13    The bill specifies that body camera data involving any use of
  5 14 force by a peace officer shall be a public record and shall not
  5 15 be exempt from public examination.
  5 16    The bill provides that the following persons may examine,
  5 17 obtain a copy of, and disseminate body camera data: a person
  5 18 who is a subject of the data or the person's attorney; a parent

  5 25 of the data, or the attorney for the person who is a subject of
  5 26 the data, has given written authority to the law enforcement
  5 27 agency to disclose the data to that other person, unless the
  5 28 subject of the data is a minor; any other person seeking data,
  5 29 if the parent or legal guardian of a minor who is a subject of
  5 30 the data, or the attorney for the parent or legal guardian,
  5 31 has given written authority to the law enforcement agency to
  5 32 disclose the data to that other person; or any other person
  5 33 seeking data of a deceased person who is a subject of the data,
  5 34 if the immediate family member or legally authorized designee
  5 35 of the deceased person, or the attorney for the immediate
  6  1 family member or legally authorized designee, has given written
  6  2 authority to the law enforcement agency to disclose the data to
  6  3 that other person.
  6  4    The bill prohibits a peace officer from reviewing or
  6  5 receiving an accounting of any body camera data that involves
  6  6 any use of force and is subject to a minimum two=year retention
  6  7 period under the bill, prior to completing any required initial
  6  8 reports, statements, and interviews regarding the recorded
  6  9 event.
  6 10    The bill prohibits a law enforcement agency from using or
  6 11 divulging body camera data for commercial or other non=law
  6 12 enforcement purposes.
  6 13    The bill allows a law enforcement agency to authorize a third
  6 14 party to act as its agent in maintaining body camera data,
  6 15 provided that the agent shall not be permitted to independently
  6 16 examine or alter any data, except to delete data as required by
  6 17 law or agency retention policies.
  6 18    The bill specifies that any member of the public who
  6 19 is a subject of the body camera data, the parent or legal
  6 20 guardian of a minor who is a subject of body camera data, or a
  6 21 deceased person's immediate family member or legally authorized
  6 22 designee, shall be permitted to review that specific body
  6 23 camera data in order to make a determination as to whether to
  6 24 voluntarily request that the body camera data be subject to a
  6 25 two=year retention period under the bill.
  6 26    The bill may include a state mandate as defined in Code
  6 27 section 25B.3.  The bill makes inapplicable Code section 25B.2,
  6 28 subsection 3, which would relieve a political subdivision from
  6 29 complying with a state mandate if funding for the cost of
  6 30 the state mandate is not provided or specified.  Therefore,
  6 31 political subdivisions are required to comply with any state
  6 32 mandate included in the bill.
