  7  1 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  7  2 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  7  3    This bill relates to street rods and custom motor vehicles.
  7  4    DIVISION I == STREET RODS AND CUSTOM VEHICLES.  Current
  7  5 law defines "street rod" as a vehicle manufactured prior to
  7  6 the year 1949, or any vehicle designed and manufactured to
  7  7 resemble a vehicle manufactured prior to the year 1949. The
  7  8 bill defines "custom vehicle" as a vehicle with a model year
  7  9 that is at least 25 years old and that was manufactured after
  7 10 1948, or any vehicle designed and manufactured to resemble a
  7 11 vehicle with a model year that is at least 25 years old and that
  7 12 was manufactured after 1948.
  7 13    Current law sets forth certain requirements for registering
  7 14 a vehicle as a street rod. The bill adds two requirements: a
  7 15 statement that the vehicle will be maintained for occasional
  7 16 transportation or exhibition in club activities, parades,
  7 17 tours, or other similar uses, but will not be operated for
  7 18 general, everyday transportation, and proof that the vehicle
  7 19 passed a safety inspection approved by the department of
  7 20 transportation by rule. The bill applies the existing
  7 21 requirements and these new requirements to custom vehicles.
  7 22 The bill also applies other existing requirements for street
  7 23 rods to custom vehicles, including a non=safety=related
  7 24 physical inspection, a 30=day window after an inspection during
  7 25 which the vehicle owner may register the vehicle as a street
  7 26 rod or custom vehicle, and a safety inspection and fee required
  7 27 for vehicles that do not meet certain equipment requirements.
  7 28    The bill provides that the registration fee for custom
  7 29 vehicles is determined the same way as the registration fee for
  7 30 street rods, and provides that street rods and custom vehicles
  7 31 are exempt from periodic vehicle inspections and emissions
  7 32 requirements imposed by Iowa law.
  7 33    DIVISION II == SIGNAL LAMPS AND LIGHTING DEVICES.  The
  7 34 bill defines "blue dot tail light" as a red lamp installed
  7 35 in the rear of a street rod or custom vehicle, containing a
  8  1 blue or purple insert no more than one inch in diameter, and
  8  2 used for a rear lamp, rear signal lamp, rear hazard lamp, or
  8  3 rear reflector. The bill provides that street rods and custom
  8  4 vehicles may use blue dot tail lights.
