  6 28    PROHIBITIONS AND DISCLOSURE PROVISIONS.  The bill prohibits
  6 29 an operator from engaging in targeted advertising that is
  6 30 based on or derived from information the operator acquired

  7 23    However, these prohibitions shall not be construed to

  7 25 developing, supporting, improving, or diagnosing the operator's
  7 26 internet site, service, or application.

  7 32 the school district, accredited nonpublic school, or area
  7 33 education agency requests deletion of data under the control of

  8 29 to impose a duty upon a provider of an electronic store,
  8 30 gateway, marketplace, or other means of purchasing or

  6 18 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  6 19 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  6 20    This bill places restrictions on operators of internet
  6 21 sites, online services, online applications, and mobile
  6 22 applications designed, marketed, and used primarily for
  6 23 kindergarten through grade twelve school purposes.  A violation
  6 24 of any of the restrictions is an unlawful practice pursuant to
  6 25 Code section 714.16, a prohibited practice or act under Code
  6 26 section 714H.3, and, in addition, the attorney general may
  6 27 bring a civil action on behalf of an injured person.
  6 28    PROHIBITIONS AND DISCLOSURE PROVISIONS.  The bill prohibits
  6 29 an operator from engaging in targeted advertising that is
  6 30 based on or derived from information the operator acquired
  6 31 through the operator's internet site, service, or application;
  6 32 from using information created or gathered by the operator's
  6 33 internet site, service, or application, to amass a profile
  6 34 about a student enrolled in a kindergarten through grade
  6 35 twelve school in this state except in furtherance of school
  7  1 purposes; and from selling a student's information, though this
  7  2 prohibition does not apply to the purchase, merger, or other
  7  3 type of acquisition of an operator by another entity, provided
  7  4 that the operator or successor entity continues to be subject
  7  5 to the restrictions relating to previously acquired student
  7  6 information.
  7  7    The operator is also prohibited from disclosing covered
  7  8 information unless the disclosure is in furtherance of the
  7  9 kindergarten through grade twelve school purposes and the
  7 10 recipient of the covered information is subject to similar
  7 11 restrictions.  Disclosure is also authorized in order to ensure
  7 12 legal and regulatory compliance; to respond to or participate
  7 13 in judicial process, or to protect the safety of the internet
  7 14 site users or persons identified on the internet site or
  7 15 security of the internet site.
  7 16    The operator may also disclose covered information to a
  7 17 service provider if the operator implements and maintains
  7 18 reasonable security procedures and practices, and, if the
  7 19 service provider is contractually prohibited from using any
  7 20 of the information for any purpose other than providing the
  7 21 contracted service to, or on behalf of, the operator, and from
  7 22 disclosing any covered information to subsequent third parties.
  7 23    However, these prohibitions shall not be construed to
  7 24 prohibit the operator's use of information for maintaining,
  7 25 developing, supporting, improving, or diagnosing the operator's
  7 26 internet site, service, or application.
  7 27    The operator is required to implement and maintain
  7 28 reasonable security procedures and practices appropriate to the
  7 29 nature of the covered information, and protect that information
  7 30 from unauthorized access, destruction, use, modification, or
  7 31 disclosure; and to delete a student's covered information if
  7 32 the school district, accredited nonpublic school, or area
  7 33 education agency requests deletion of data under the control of
  7 34 the school district, school, or area education agency.
  7 35    Notwithstanding the disclosure prohibitions, as long as the
  8  1 operator does not violate the provisions prohibiting targeting
  8  2 advertising, the use of student information to amass a profile,
  8  3 and the sale of student information, an operator may disclose
  8  4 covered information of a student if other provisions of federal
  8  5 or state law require the operator to disclose the information,
  8  6 or for legitimate research purposes as required by and subject
  8  7 to state or federal law and under the direction of the school
  8  8 district, school, or area education agency; and to state or

  8 12 from using deidentified student covered information to improve
  8 13 educational products or to demonstrate the effectiveness of
  8 14 the operator's products or services and their marketing; to
  8 15 prohibit an operator from sharing aggregated deidentified
  8 16 student covered information for the development and improvement
  8 17 of educational internet sites, services, or applications; to
  8 18 limit a law enforcement agency from obtaining information
  8 19 as authorized by law or court order; to limit the ability
  8 20 of an operator to use student data for adaptive learning or
  8 21 customized student learning purposes; to apply to general
  8 22 audience internet sites, general audience online services,
  8 23 general audience online applications, or general audience
  8 24 mobile applications; to restrict internet service providers
  8 25 from providing internet connectivity to schools or students
  8 26 and their families; to prohibit an operator from marketing
  8 27 educational products directly to parents so long as the
  8 28 marketing did not result from the use of covered information;
  8 29 to impose a duty upon a provider of an electronic store,
  8 30 gateway, marketplace, or other means of purchasing or
  8 31 downloading software or applications to review or enforce
  8 32 compliance with applicable restrictions by such software
  8 33 or applications; to impose a duty upon a provider of an
  8 34 interactive computer service to review or enforce compliance
  8 35 by third=party content providers; or to impede the ability of
  9  1 students to download, export, or otherwise save or maintain
  9  2 their own student=created data or documents.
  9  3    REMEDIES.  The bill provides that a violation of new Code
  9  4 chapter 715D is a prohibited practice or act under Code section
  9  5 714H.3, providing for a private right of action for a person
  9  6 who suffers an ascertainable loss of money or property as the

  9  8 bring an action at law to recover actual damages and to seek

  9 13 seek and obtain an order that a party held to violate the

  6 21 sites, online services, online applications, and mobile
  6 22 applications designed, marketed, and used primarily for

  6 24 of any of the restrictions is an unlawful practice pursuant to
  6 25 Code section 714.16, a prohibited practice or act under Code
  6 26 section 714H.3, and, in addition, the attorney general may
  6 27 bring a civil action on behalf of an injured person.
  6 28    PROHIBITIONS AND DISCLOSURE PROVISIONS.  The bill prohibits
  6 29 an operator from engaging in targeted advertising that is
  6 30 based on or derived from information the operator acquired
  6 31 through the operator's internet site, service, or application;
  6 32 from using information created or gathered by the operator's
  6 33 internet site, service, or application, to amass a profile
  6 34 about a student enrolled in a kindergarten through grade
  6 35 twelve school in this state except in furtherance of school
  7  1 purposes; and from selling a student's information, though this
  7  2 prohibition does not apply to the purchase, merger, or other
  7  3 type of acquisition of an operator by another entity, provided
  7  4 that the operator or successor entity continues to be subject
  7  5 to the restrictions relating to previously acquired student
  7  6 information.
  7  7    The operator is also prohibited from disclosing covered
  7  8 information unless the disclosure is in furtherance of the
  7  9 kindergarten through grade twelve school purposes and the
  7 10 recipient of the covered information is subject to similar
  7 11 restrictions.  Disclosure is also authorized in order to ensure
  7 12 legal and regulatory compliance; to respond to or participate

  7 14 site users or persons identified on the internet site or
  7 15 security of the internet site.
  7 16    The operator may also disclose covered information to a
  7 17 service provider if the operator implements and maintains
  7 18 reasonable security procedures and practices, and, if the
  7 19 service provider is contractually prohibited from using any
  7 20 of the information for any purpose other than providing the
  7 21 contracted service to, or on behalf of, the operator, and from
  7 22 disclosing any covered information to subsequent third parties.
  7 23    However, these prohibitions shall not be construed to
  7 24 prohibit the operator's use of information for maintaining,
  7 25 developing, supporting, improving, or diagnosing the operator's
  7 26 internet site, service, or application.
  7 27    The operator is required to implement and maintain
  7 28 reasonable security procedures and practices appropriate to the

  7 32 the school district, accredited nonpublic school, or area
  7 33 education agency requests deletion of data under the control of
  7 34 the school district, school, or area education agency.
  7 35    Notwithstanding the disclosure prohibitions, as long as the
  8  1 operator does not violate the provisions prohibiting targeting
  8  2 advertising, the use of student information to amass a profile,
  8  3 and the sale of student information, an operator may disclose
  8  4 covered information of a student if other provisions of federal
  8  5 or state law require the operator to disclose the information,
  8  6 or for legitimate research purposes as required by and subject
  8  7 to state or federal law and under the direction of the school
  8  8 district, school, or area education agency; and to state or
  8  9 local educational agencies as permitted by state or federal
  8 10 law.
  8 11    The bill shall not be construed to prohibit an operator
  8 12 from using deidentified student covered information to improve
  8 13 educational products or to demonstrate the effectiveness of
  8 14 the operator's products or services and their marketing; to
  8 15 prohibit an operator from sharing aggregated deidentified
  8 16 student covered information for the development and improvement
  8 17 of educational internet sites, services, or applications; to
  8 18 limit a law enforcement agency from obtaining information
  8 19 as authorized by law or court order; to limit the ability
  8 20 of an operator to use student data for adaptive learning or
  8 21 customized student learning purposes; to apply to general
  8 22 audience internet sites, general audience online services,
  8 23 general audience online applications, or general audience
  8 24 mobile applications; to restrict internet service providers
  8 25 from providing internet connectivity to schools or students
  8 26 and their families; to prohibit an operator from marketing
  8 27 educational products directly to parents so long as the
  8 28 marketing did not result from the use of covered information;
  8 29 to impose a duty upon a provider of an electronic store,
  8 30 gateway, marketplace, or other means of purchasing or
  8 31 downloading software or applications to review or enforce
  8 32 compliance with applicable restrictions by such software
  8 33 or applications; to impose a duty upon a provider of an
  8 34 interactive computer service to review or enforce compliance
  8 35 by third=party content providers; or to impede the ability of
  9  1 students to download, export, or otherwise save or maintain
  9  2 their own student=created data or documents.
  9  3    REMEDIES.  The bill provides that a violation of new Code
  9  4 chapter 715D is a prohibited practice or act under Code section
  9  5 714H.3, providing for a private right of action for a person
  9  6 who suffers an ascertainable loss of money or property as the
  9  7 result of a prohibited practice or act, allowing the person to
  9  8 bring an action at law to recover actual damages and to seek
  9  9 court protection from further violations including temporary
  9 10 and permanent injunctive relief.
