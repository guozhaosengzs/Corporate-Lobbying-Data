 18 11                           EXPLANATION
 18 12 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
 18 13 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
 18 14    This bill relates to the administration of programs by the
 18 15 economic development authority (EDA) by creating a renewable
 18 16 chemical production tax credit, modifying the tax credit for
 18 17 investments in qualifying businesses and community=based seed
 18 18 capital funds, and modifying the entrepreneur investment awards
 18 19 program.
 18 20    DIVISION I ==== RENEWABLE CHEMICAL PRODUCTION TAX CREDIT.
 18 21   Division I creates a renewable chemical production tax credit
 18 22 program (program) that will be administered by the EDA and that
 18 23 will provide tax credits to eligible businesses that produce
 18 24 renewable chemicals in Iowa from biomass feedstock.  "Renewable
 18 25 chemical", "biomass feedstock", and other related terms are
 18 26 defined in the division.
 18 27    In order to qualify for the tax credit, a business must
 18 28 meet several requirements.  First, the business must be
 18 29 physically located in Iowa and operated for profit under
 18 30 single management.  Second, the business must not be an
 18 31 entity providing professional services, health care services,
 18 32 or medical treatments, or be engaged primarily in retail
 18 33 operations.  Third, the business must have organized, expanded,
 18 34 or located in Iowa on or after the effective date of the
 18 35 division.  Fourth, the business must not be, in the discretion
 19  1 of the EDA, ineligible under certain provisions relating to the
 19  2 relocation or reduction of business operations within Iowa.
 19  3 Fifth, the business must be in compliance with all agreements
 19  4 entered into under the program or other programs administered
 19  5 by the EDA.
 19  6    An eligible business seeking a tax credit is required
 19  7 to apply to the EDA during the calendar year following the
 19  8 calendar year in which the renewable chemicals are produced.
 19  9 The application must include the amount of renewable chemicals
 19 10 produced in Iowa from biomass feedstock by the eligible
 19 11 business during the calendar year, measured in pounds, and any
 19 12 other information reasonably required by the EDA in order to
 19 13 establish and verify eligibility under the program.  The EDA
 19 14 may accept applications on a continuous basis or may establish
 19 15 an annual application deadline.
 19 16    Before being issued a tax credit, an eligible business
 19 17 is required to enter into an agreement with the EDA for the
 19 18 successful completion of all requirements of the program.  The
 19 19 EDA is authorized to impose two compliance cost fees under the
 19 20 program.  The first fee equals $500 per agreement.  The second
 19 21 fee equals 0.5 percent of the value of the tax credit claimed
 19 22 pursuant to the agreement if the agreement has an aggregate tax
 19 23 credit value of $100,000 or greater.
 19 24    An eligible business that fails to comply with the
 19 25 requirements of the program or the terms of an agreement with
 19 26 the EDA may have its tax credits reduced, terminated, or
 19 27 rescinded, and may be subject to the repayment or recapture of
 19 28 claimed tax credits.
 19 29    Upon determining that all requirements of an agreement and
 19 30 the program have been fulfilled, the EDA shall issue a tax
 19 31 credit and related tax credit certificate to the eligible
 19 32 business in an amount equal to the product of $.05 multiplied
 19 33 by the number of pounds of renewable chemicals produced in Iowa
 19 34 from biomass feedstock by the eligible business during the
 19 35 calendar year.  Renewable chemicals produced by an eligible
 20  1 business prior to the effective date of the division, or
 20  2 prior to the date the business first qualifies as an eligible
 20  3 business, or after calendar year 2025, shall not qualify for
 20  4 the tax credit.
 20  5    The tax credit shall be claimed for the tax year during
 20  6 which the eligible business was issued the tax credit.  The tax
 20  7 credit may be claimed against the individual income tax and the
 20  8 corporate income tax.  The credit is refundable or may, at the
 20  9 election of the taxpayer, be carried forward for up to one tax
 20 10 year.   The tax credit shall not be transferred to any person.  A
 20 11 tax credit issued to a partnership, limited liability company,
 20 12 S corporation, cooperative organized under Code chapter 501
 20 13 and filing as a partnership for federal tax purposes, estate,
 20 14 or trust electing to have the income taxed directly to the
 20 15 individual may be claimed by the individual based upon the pro
 20 16 rata share of the individual's earnings from that entity.
 20 17    The division provides that the program is subject to the
 20 18 EDA's maximum aggregate tax credit cap of $170 million per
 20 19 fiscal year in Code section 15.119, and not more than $15
 20 20 million per fiscal year may be issued by the EDA under the
 20 21 program.  In addition, the maximum amount of tax credit that
 20 22 may be issued to an eligible business in any one calendar year
 20 23 shall not exceed $1 million or $500,000, depending on whether
 20 24 the eligible business has been operating in Iowa at the time of
 20 25 application for five or fewer years, or more than five years,
 20 26 respectively.  An eligible business shall not receive more than
 20 27 five tax credits under the program.  The EDA is required to
 20 28 issue tax credits on a first=come, first=served basis until the
 20 29 maximum amount of $15 million per fiscal year is reached.  If
 20 30 the amount of tax credits exceeds this amount in a fiscal year,
 20 31 the EDA is required to establish a wait list and give priority
 20 32 in subsequent years to the eligible businesses on the wait
 20 33 list.
 20 34    The division provides for the confidentiality of certain
 20 35 information under the program.  The identity of a tax credit
 21  1 recipient and the amount of the tax credit shall be considered
 21  2 public information under Code chapter 22 (examination of public
 21  3 records), but any other information or record in the possession
 21  4 of the EDA with respect to the program shall be presumed by
 21  5 the EDA to be a trade secret protected under Code chapter 550
 21  6 or common law and shall be kept confidential by the EDA unless
 21  7 otherwise ordered by a court.
 21  8    The division takes effect upon enactment and applies to
 21  9 renewable chemicals produced in Iowa from biomass feedstock on
 21 10 or after that date.  The division applies retroactively to tax
 21 11 years beginning on or after January 1, 2015.
 21 12    DIVISION II ==== ANGEL INVESTOR TAX CREDITS.   Division II
 21 13 makes several changes to the tax credit for investments in
 21 14 qualifying businesses and community=based seed capital funds,
 21 15 often referred to as the angel investor tax credits.  The
 21 16 division amends the purpose of the tax credit in Code section
 21 17 15E.41.  The division excludes investments in community=based
 21 18 seed capital funds from qualifying for the tax credit and
 21 19 makes several conforming amendments to remove references to
 21 20 community=based seed capital funds from the Code.
 21 21    The division modifies the amount and dollar limitation of
 21 22 the tax credit for a taxpayer.  The tax credit is increased
 21 23 from 20 percent to 25 percent of a taxpayer's equity investment
 21 24 in a qualifying business.  Under current law, a taxpayer cannot
 21 25 claim more than $50,000 of tax credit per investment in a
 21 26 qualifying business, and for each tax year a taxpayer and the
 21 27 taxpayer's affiliates cannot claim tax credits for more than
 21 28 five investments in five different qualifying businesses.  The
 21 29 division amends this dollar limitation to prohibit a natural
 21 30 person and the person's spouse, child, or sibling from claiming
 21 31 a combined amount of more than $100,000 in tax credits per tax
 21 32 year.
 21 33    The division also provides that no more than $500,000 in tax
 21 34 credits may be issued per tax year for equity investments in
 21 35 any one qualifying business.
 22  1 The division modifies the procedures for claiming the tax
 22  2 credit.  Under current law, the tax credit is not refundable
 22  3 but available for carryforward for up to five tax years.  The
 22  4 division makes the tax credit refundable for an investment
 22  5 made by a natural person, and for any other person reduces the
 22  6 carryforward period to three years.
 22  7    The division strikes a provision permitting the EDA
 22  8 to cooperate with small business development centers to
 22  9 disseminate information regarding the credits and to develop
 22 10 standard application forms, and requiring the EDA to distribute
 22 11 copies of the application forms to all community=based seed
 22 12 capital funds and potential individual investors.
 22 13    The division modifies the eligibility requirements for
 22 14 qualifying businesses.  The division strikes the requirement
 22 15 that a business have an owner that meets at least one of
 22 16 four qualifications relating to business education or
 22 17 business experience.  The division requires that a business
 22 18 be participating in an entrepreneurial assistance program,
 22 19 as defined in the division, but allows the EDA to waive this
 22 20 requirement if the business establishes that its owners,
 22 21 directors, officers, and employees have an appropriate level
 22 22 of experience such that an entrepreneurial assistance program
 22 23 would not materially change the prospects of the business.
 22 24 The EDA is allowed to consult with outside service providers
 22 25 in considering such a waiver.  The division increases from $5
 22 26 million to $10 million the maximum amount of net worth that
 22 27 a business may have to be considered a qualifying business.
 22 28 The division increases from $250,000 to $500,000 the amount of
 22 29 financing that a business must have in order to be considered a
 22 30 qualifying business, removes "near equity" from the types of
 22 31 financing that will be considered in that calculation, requires
 22 32 that the financing be secured at the time of application for
 22 33 the tax credits, and requires that the business have at least
 22 34 two investors at the time of application for the tax credits.
 22 35 These modified eligibility requirements apply to businesses
 23  1 that submit an application to the EDA to be registered as a
 23  2 qualifying business on or after the effective date of this
 23  3 division of the bill, and businesses that submitted such an
 23  4 application to the EDA before the effective date of this
 23  5 division of the bill shall be governed by current law.
 23  6    The division provides for the confidentiality of certain
 23  7 information with regard to the tax credit.  The identity of
 23  8 a qualifying business, the identity of an investor and the
 23  9 qualifying business in which the investor made an equity
 23 10 investment, and the total number and amount of tax credits
 23 11 issued shall be considered public information under Code
 23 12 chapter 22 (examination of public records), but any other
 23 13 information or record in the possession of the EDA with respect
 23 14 to the program shall be presumed by the EDA to be a trade secret
 23 15 protected under Code chapter 550 or common law and shall be
 23 16 kept confidential by the EDA unless otherwise ordered by a
 23 17 court.
 23 18    The division takes effect upon enactment and applies to
 23 19 equity investments in a qualifying business made on or after
 23 20 that date.  Equity investments in a qualifying business or
 23 21 community=based seed capital fund made prior to the effective
 23 22 date of the division shall be governed by current law.
 23 23    DIVISION III ==== ENTREPRENEUR INVESTMENT AWARDS PROGRAM.
 23 24  Division III amends the entrepreneur investment awards program
 23 25 administered by the EDA.  The division strikes provisions that
 23 26 prohibited the EDA from making awards under the program since
 23 27 July 1, 2014, and that required the EDA by December 31, 2014,
 23 28 to conduct a comprehensive review of the program and submit
 23 29 a report with specified information to the governor and the
 23 30 general assembly.
 23 31    The division modifies the purpose of the program to be
 23 32 to provide financial assistance to eligible entrepreneurial
 23 33 assistance providers (provider) that provide technical and
 23 34 financial assistance to entrepreneurs and start=up companies
 23 35 seeking to create, locate, or expand a business in Iowa.
 24  1 "Financial assistance" is defined in the division.
 24  2    The division changes the requirements for receiving an
 24  3 award.  To be eligible to receive an award under current
 24  4 law, an entrepreneurial assistance program must have been
 24  5 an Iowa=based business, expended at least $500,000 during
 24  6 the previous fiscal year to provide technical and financial
 24  7 assistance services that meet the broad=based needs of
 24  8 entrepreneurs seeking to create, locate, or expand a business
 24  9 in Iowa that intends to derive more than 10 percent of its
 24 10 gross sales from markets outside Iowa; and must have engaged
 24 11 and communicated with certain other programs, funding sources,
 24 12 and entities for its entrepreneur clients.  The division
 24 13 amends the eligibility for receiving financial assistance to
 24 14 require that a provider have its principal place of operations
 24 15 in Iowa and that the provider offer a comprehensive set of
 24 16 business development services to emerging and early=stage
 24 17 innovation companies to assist in the creation, location,
 24 18 growth, and long=term success of the company in Iowa.
 24 19 "Business development services" is defined in the division.
 24 20 Business development services may be performed at the physical
 24 21 location of the provider or the company and may be provided in
 24 22 consideration of equity participation in the company, a fee for
 24 23 services, or a membership agreement with the company.
 24 24    Under current law, the EDA board could approve, deny, or
 24 25 defer each application for a grant, and was required to award
 24 26 grants on a first=come, first=served basis.  The division
 24 27 specifies that the EDA board has the discretion to approve,
 24 28 deny, or defer each application for financial assistance and
 24 29 that the amount of financial assistance awarded to a provider
 24 30 is within the discretion of the EDA.  The division requires
 24 31 the EDA to award financial assistance on a competitive basis
 24 32 and allows the EDA to develop scoring criteria and establish
 24 33 minimum requirements for the receipt of a financial assistance
 24 34 award.
 24 35    In addition to the four factors relating to the provider's
 25  1 professional staff that the EDA may consider under current
 25  2 law in deciding whether to award financial assistance, the
 25  3 division provides that the EDA may also consider the service
 25  4 model and likelihood of success of the provider, the provider's
 25  5 similarity to other successful providers in the country, and
 25  6 the provider's financial need.
 25  7    The division modifies the maximum award amount for a
 25  8 recipient.  Under current law, a grant to an entrepreneur
 25  9 assistance program cannot exceed the lesser of 25 percent of
 25 10 the funds expended by the program during the previous fiscal
 25 11 year, 100 percent of the funds raised from certain persons
 25 12 by the program during the previous fiscal year, or $200,000.
 25 13 The division provides that the amount of financial assistance
 25 14 awarded to any one provider shall not exceed $200,000.
 25 15    The division modifies the permitted use of funds received
 25 16 under the program.  Under current law, grants are only
 25 17 permitted to be used for the purpose of operating costs
 25 18 incurred by the program.  The division specifies that financial
 25 19 assistance awarded to a provider shall only be used for
 25 20 the purpose of operating costs incurred by the provider in
 25 21 the provision of business development services to emerging
 25 22 and early=stage innovation companies in Iowa.  The division
 25 23 further requires that such financial assistance shall not be
 25 24 distributed to owners or investors of the company to which the
 25 25 business development services are being provided and shall not
 25 26 be provided to other persons assisting with the provision of
 25 27 the services.
 25 28    Under current law, an entrepreneurial assistance provider is
 25 29 required to accept client referrals from the EDA as a condition
 25 30 of receiving a grant.  The division provides that the EDA may
 25 31 make client referrals to eligible providers.
 25 32    DIVISION IV ==== MISCELLANEOUS CHANGES.  Division IV makes
 25 33 several miscellaneous changes to other EDA programs.  The
 25 34 division amends the sales and use tax refund available under
 25 35 the workforce housing tax incentive program.  That refund
 26  1 is available for sales and use tax paid prior to project
 26  2 completion, which is currently defined to mean the first date
 26  3 upon which the average annualized production of finished
 26  4 product for the preceding 90=day period at the manufacturing
 26  5 facility operated by the eligible business is at least 50
 26  6 percent of the initial design capacity of the facility.  The
 26  7 division amends the definition of "project completion" to mean
 26  8 the date on which the EDA notifies the department of revenue
 26  9 that all applicable requirements of a workforce housing tax
 26 10 incentive program agreement are satisfied.  This provision
 26 11 takes effect upon enactment and applies retroactively to July
 26 12 1, 2014, for all workforce housing tax incentive agreements
 26 13 entered into on or after that date.
 26 14    The division allows the EDA to extend the project
 26 15 completion date for a project awarded tax incentives under the
 26 16 redevelopment tax credit program and the housing enterprise
 26 17 zone tax incentives program if the property that is the subject
 26 18 of the project suffered a catastrophic fire during the 2014
 26 19 calendar year.
       LSB 1212HV (3) 86
       mm/sc
 17 31 Notwithstanding any other provision of law to the contrary,
 17 32 the economic development authority may extend the project
 17 33 completion date for a project awarded tax incentives under both
 17 34 the redevelopment tax credit program in sections 15.293A and
 17 35 15.293B and the housing enterprise zone tax incentives program
 18  1 in section 15E.193B, Code 2014, if the property that is the
 18  2 subject of the project suffered a catastrophic fire during the
 18  3 2014 calendar year.
 18  4    Sec. 38.  EFFECTIVE UPON ENACTMENT.  The section of this
 18  5 division of this Act amending section 15.355, being deemed of
 18  6 immediate importance, takes effect upon enactment.
 18  7    Sec. 39.  RETROACTIVE APPLICABILITY.  The section of
 18  8 this division of this Act amending section 15.355 applies
 18  9 retroactively to July 1, 2014, for all agreements entered into
 18 10 pursuant to section 15.354 on or after that date.
 18 11                           EXPLANATION
 18 12 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
 18 13 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
 18 14    This bill relates to the administration of programs by the
 18 15 economic development authority (EDA) by creating a renewable
 18 16 chemical production tax credit, modifying the tax credit for
 18 17 investments in qualifying businesses and community=based seed
 18 18 capital funds, and modifying the entrepreneur investment awards
 18 19 program.
 18 20    DIVISION I ==== RENEWABLE CHEMICAL PRODUCTION TAX CREDIT.
 18 21   Division I creates a renewable chemical production tax credit
 18 22 program (program) that will be administered by the EDA and that
 18 23 will provide tax credits to eligible businesses that produce
 18 24 renewable chemicals in Iowa from biomass feedstock.  "Renewable
 18 25 chemical", "biomass feedstock", and other related terms are
 18 26 defined in the division.
 18 27    In order to qualify for the tax credit, a business must
 18 28 meet several requirements.  First, the business must be
 18 29 physically located in Iowa and operated for profit under
 18 30 single management.  Second, the business must not be an
 18 31 entity providing professional services, health care services,
 18 32 or medical treatments, or be engaged primarily in retail
 18 33 operations.  Third, the business must have organized, expanded,
 18 34 or located in Iowa on or after the effective date of the
 18 35 division.  Fourth, the business must not be, in the discretion
 19  1 of the EDA, ineligible under certain provisions relating to the
 19  2 relocation or reduction of business operations within Iowa.
 19  3 Fifth, the business must be in compliance with all agreements
 19  4 entered into under the program or other programs administered
 19  5 by the EDA.
 19  6    An eligible business seeking a tax credit is required
 19  7 to apply to the EDA during the calendar year following the
 19  8 calendar year in which the renewable chemicals are produced.
 19  9 The application must include the amount of renewable chemicals
 19 10 produced in Iowa from biomass feedstock by the eligible
 19 11 business during the calendar year, measured in pounds, and any
 19 12 other information reasonably required by the EDA in order to
 19 13 establish and verify eligibility under the program.  The EDA
 19 14 may accept applications on a continuous basis or may establish
 19 15 an annual application deadline.
 19 16    Before being issued a tax credit, an eligible business
 19 17 is required to enter into an agreement with the EDA for the
 19 18 successful completion of all requirements of the program.  The
 19 19 EDA is authorized to impose two compliance cost fees under the
 19 20 program.  The first fee equals $500 per agreement.  The second
 19 21 fee equals 0.5 percent of the value of the tax credit claimed
 19 22 pursuant to the agreement if the agreement has an aggregate tax
 19 23 credit value of $100,000 or greater.
 19 24    An eligible business that fails to comply with the
 19 25 requirements of the program or the terms of an agreement with
 19 26 the EDA may have its tax credits reduced, terminated, or
 19 27 rescinded, and may be subject to the repayment or recapture of
 19 28 claimed tax credits.
 19 29    Upon determining that all requirements of an agreement and
 19 30 the program have been fulfilled, the EDA shall issue a tax
 19 31 credit and related tax credit certificate to the eligible
 19 32 business in an amount equal to the product of $.05 multiplied
 19 33 by the number of pounds of renewable chemicals produced in Iowa
 19 34 from biomass feedstock by the eligible business during the
 19 35 calendar year.  Renewable chemicals produced by an eligible
 20  1 business prior to the effective date of the division, or
 20  2 prior to the date the business first qualifies as an eligible
 20  3 business, or after calendar year 2025, shall not qualify for
 20  4 the tax credit.
 20  5    The tax credit shall be claimed for the tax year during
 20  6 which the eligible business was issued the tax credit.  The tax
 20  7 credit may be claimed against the individual income tax and the
 20  8 corporate income tax.  The credit is refundable or may, at the
 20  9 election of the taxpayer, be carried forward for up to one tax
 20 10 year.   The tax credit shall not be transferred to any person.  A
 20 11 tax credit issued to a partnership, limited liability company,
 20 12 S corporation, cooperative organized under Code chapter 501
 20 13 and filing as a partnership for federal tax purposes, estate,
 20 14 or trust electing to have the income taxed directly to the
 20 15 individual may be claimed by the individual based upon the pro
 20 16 rata share of the individual's earnings from that entity.
 20 17    The division provides that the program is subject to the
 20 18 EDA's maximum aggregate tax credit cap of $170 million per
 20 19 fiscal year in Code section 15.119, and not more than $15
 20 20 million per fiscal year may be issued by the EDA under the
 20 21 program.  In addition, the maximum amount of tax credit that
 20 22 may be issued to an eligible business in any one calendar year
 20 23 shall not exceed $1 million or $500,000, depending on whether
 20 24 the eligible business has been operating in Iowa at the time of
 20 25 application for five or fewer years, or more than five years,
 20 26 respectively.  An eligible business shall not receive more than
 20 27 five tax credits under the program.  The EDA is required to
 20 28 issue tax credits on a first=come, first=served basis until the
 20 29 maximum amount of $15 million per fiscal year is reached.  If
 20 30 the amount of tax credits exceeds this amount in a fiscal year,
 20 31 the EDA is required to establish a wait list and give priority
 20 32 in subsequent years to the eligible businesses on the wait
 20 33 list.
 20 34    The division provides for the confidentiality of certain
 20 35 information under the program.  The identity of a tax credit
 21  1 recipient and the amount of the tax credit shall be considered
 21  2 public information under Code chapter 22 (examination of public
 21  3 records), but any other information or record in the possession
 21  4 of the EDA with respect to the program shall be presumed by
 21  5 the EDA to be a trade secret protected under Code chapter 550
 21  6 or common law and shall be kept confidential by the EDA unless
 21  7 otherwise ordered by a court.
 21  8    The division takes effect upon enactment and applies to
 21  9 renewable chemicals produced in Iowa from biomass feedstock on
 21 10 or after that date.  The division applies retroactively to tax
 21 11 years beginning on or after January 1, 2015.
 21 12    DIVISION II ==== ANGEL INVESTOR TAX CREDITS.   Division II
 21 13 makes several changes to the tax credit for investments in
 21 14 qualifying businesses and community=based seed capital funds,
 21 15 often referred to as the angel investor tax credits.  The
 21 16 division amends the purpose of the tax credit in Code section
 21 17 15E.41.  The division excludes investments in community=based
 21 18 seed capital funds from qualifying for the tax credit and
 21 19 makes several conforming amendments to remove references to
 21 20 community=based seed capital funds from the Code.
 21 21    The division modifies the amount and dollar limitation of
 21 22 the tax credit for a taxpayer.  The tax credit is increased
 21 23 from 20 percent to 25 percent of a taxpayer's equity investment
 21 24 in a qualifying business.  Under current law, a taxpayer cannot
 21 25 claim more than $50,000 of tax credit per investment in a
 21 26 qualifying business, and for each tax year a taxpayer and the
 21 27 taxpayer's affiliates cannot claim tax credits for more than
 21 28 five investments in five different qualifying businesses.  The
 21 29 division amends this dollar limitation to prohibit a natural
 21 30 person and the person's spouse, child, or sibling from claiming
 21 31 a combined amount of more than $100,000 in tax credits per tax
 21 32 year.
 21 33    The division also provides that no more than $500,000 in tax
 21 34 credits may be issued per tax year for equity investments in
 21 35 any one qualifying business.
 22  1 The division modifies the procedures for claiming the tax
 22  2 credit.  Under current law, the tax credit is not refundable
 22  3 but available for carryforward for up to five tax years.  The
 22  4 division makes the tax credit refundable for an investment
 22  5 made by a natural person, and for any other person reduces the
 22  6 carryforward period to three years.
 22  7    The division strikes a provision permitting the EDA
 22  8 to cooperate with small business development centers to
 22  9 disseminate information regarding the credits and to develop
 22 10 standard application forms, and requiring the EDA to distribute
 22 11 copies of the application forms to all community=based seed
 22 12 capital funds and potential individual investors.
 22 13    The division modifies the eligibility requirements for
 22 14 qualifying businesses.  The division strikes the requirement
 22 15 that a business have an owner that meets at least one of
 22 16 four qualifications relating to business education or
 22 17 business experience.  The division requires that a business
 22 18 be participating in an entrepreneurial assistance program,
 22 19 as defined in the division, but allows the EDA to waive this
 22 20 requirement if the business establishes that its owners,
 22 21 directors, officers, and employees have an appropriate level
 22 22 of experience such that an entrepreneurial assistance program
 22 23 would not materially change the prospects of the business.
 22 24 The EDA is allowed to consult with outside service providers
 22 25 in considering such a waiver.  The division increases from $5
 22 26 million to $10 million the maximum amount of net worth that
 22 27 a business may have to be considered a qualifying business.
 22 28 The division increases from $250,000 to $500,000 the amount of
 22 29 financing that a business must have in order to be considered a
 22 30 qualifying business, removes "near equity" from the types of
 22 31 financing that will be considered in that calculation, requires
 22 32 that the financing be secured at the time of application for
 22 33 the tax credits, and requires that the business have at least
 22 34 two investors at the time of application for the tax credits.
 22 35 These modified eligibility requirements apply to businesses
 23  1 that submit an application to the EDA to be registered as a
 23  2 qualifying business on or after the effective date of this
 23  3 division of the bill, and businesses that submitted such an
 23  4 application to the EDA before the effective date of this
 23  5 division of the bill shall be governed by current law.
 23  6    The division provides for the confidentiality of certain
 23  7 information with regard to the tax credit.  The identity of
 23  8 a qualifying business, the identity of an investor and the
 23  9 qualifying business in which the investor made an equity
 23 10 investment, and the total number and amount of tax credits
 23 11 issued shall be considered public information under Code
 23 12 chapter 22 (examination of public records), but any other
 23 13 information or record in the possession of the EDA with respect
 23 14 to the program shall be presumed by the EDA to be a trade secret
 23 15 protected under Code chapter 550 or common law and shall be
 23 16 kept confidential by the EDA unless otherwise ordered by a
 23 17 court.
 23 18    The division takes effect upon enactment and applies to
 23 19 equity investments in a qualifying business made on or after
 23 20 that date.  Equity investments in a qualifying business or
 23 21 community=based seed capital fund made prior to the effective
 23 22 date of the division shall be governed by current law.
 23 23    DIVISION III ==== ENTREPRENEUR INVESTMENT AWARDS PROGRAM.
 23 24  Division III amends the entrepreneur investment awards program
 23 25 administered by the EDA.  The division strikes provisions that
 23 26 prohibited the EDA from making awards under the program since
 23 27 July 1, 2014, and that required the EDA by December 31, 2014,
 23 28 to conduct a comprehensive review of the program and submit
 23 29 a report with specified information to the governor and the
 23 30 general assembly.
 23 31    The division modifies the purpose of the program to be
 23 32 to provide financial assistance to eligible entrepreneurial
 23 33 assistance providers (provider) that provide technical and
 23 34 financial assistance to entrepreneurs and start=up companies
 23 35 seeking to create, locate, or expand a business in Iowa.
 24  1 "Financial assistance" is defined in the division.
 24  2    The division changes the requirements for receiving an
 24  3 award.  To be eligible to receive an award under current
 24  4 law, an entrepreneurial assistance program must have been
 24  5 an Iowa=based business, expended at least $500,000 during
 24  6 the previous fiscal year to provide technical and financial
 24  7 assistance services that meet the broad=based needs of
 24  8 entrepreneurs seeking to create, locate, or expand a business
 24  9 in Iowa that intends to derive more than 10 percent of its
 24 10 gross sales from markets outside Iowa; and must have engaged
 24 11 and communicated with certain other programs, funding sources,
 24 12 and entities for its entrepreneur clients.  The division
 24 13 amends the eligibility for receiving financial assistance to
 24 14 require that a provider have its principal place of operations
 24 15 in Iowa and that the provider offer a comprehensive set of
 24 16 business development services to emerging and early=stage
 24 17 innovation companies to assist in the creation, location,
 24 18 growth, and long=term success of the company in Iowa.
 24 19 "Business development services" is defined in the division.
 24 20 Business development services may be performed at the physical
 24 21 location of the provider or the company and may be provided in
 24 22 consideration of equity participation in the company, a fee for
 24 23 services, or a membership agreement with the company.
 24 24    Under current law, the EDA board could approve, deny, or
 24 25 defer each application for a grant, and was required to award
 24 26 grants on a first=come, first=served basis.  The division
 24 27 specifies that the EDA board has the discretion to approve,
 24 28 deny, or defer each application for financial assistance and
 24 29 that the amount of financial assistance awarded to a provider
 24 30 is within the discretion of the EDA.  The division requires
 24 31 the EDA to award financial assistance on a competitive basis
 24 32 and allows the EDA to develop scoring criteria and establish
 24 33 minimum requirements for the receipt of a financial assistance
 24 34 award.
 24 35    In addition to the four factors relating to the provider's
 25  1 professional staff that the EDA may consider under current
 25  2 law in deciding whether to award financial assistance, the
 25  3 division provides that the EDA may also consider the service
 25  4 model and likelihood of success of the provider, the provider's
 25  5 similarity to other successful providers in the country, and
 25  6 the provider's financial need.
 25  7    The division modifies the maximum award amount for a
 25  8 recipient.  Under current law, a grant to an entrepreneur
 25  9 assistance program cannot exceed the lesser of 25 percent of
 25 10 the funds expended by the program during the previous fiscal
 25 11 year, 100 percent of the funds raised from certain persons
 25 12 by the program during the previous fiscal year, or $200,000.
 25 13 The division provides that the amount of financial assistance
 25 14 awarded to any one provider shall not exceed $200,000.
 25 15    The division modifies the permitted use of funds received
 25 16 under the program.  Under current law, grants are only
 25 17 permitted to be used for the purpose of operating costs
 25 18 incurred by the program.  The division specifies that financial
 25 19 assistance awarded to a provider shall only be used for
 25 20 the purpose of operating costs incurred by the provider in
 25 21 the provision of business development services to emerging
 25 22 and early=stage innovation companies in Iowa.  The division
 25 23 further requires that such financial assistance shall not be
 25 24 distributed to owners or investors of the company to which the
 25 25 business development services are being provided and shall not
 25 26 be provided to other persons assisting with the provision of
 25 27 the services.
 25 28    Under current law, an entrepreneurial assistance provider is
 25 29 required to accept client referrals from the EDA as a condition
 25 30 of receiving a grant.  The division provides that the EDA may
 25 31 make client referrals to eligible providers.
 25 32    DIVISION IV ==== MISCELLANEOUS CHANGES.  Division IV makes
 25 33 several miscellaneous changes to other EDA programs.  The
 25 34 division amends the sales and use tax refund available under
 25 35 the workforce housing tax incentive program.  That refund
 26  1 is available for sales and use tax paid prior to project
 26  2 completion, which is currently defined to mean the first date
 26  3 upon which the average annualized production of finished
 26  4 product for the preceding 90=day period at the manufacturing
 26  5 facility operated by the eligible business is at least 50
 26  6 percent of the initial design capacity of the facility.  The
 26  7 division amends the definition of "project completion" to mean
 26  8 the date on which the EDA notifies the department of revenue
 26  9 that all applicable requirements of a workforce housing tax
 26 10 incentive program agreement are satisfied.  This provision
 26 11 takes effect upon enactment and applies retroactively to July
 26 12 1, 2014, for all workforce housing tax incentive agreements
 26 13 entered into on or after that date.
 26 14    The division allows the EDA to extend the project
 26 15 completion date for a project awarded tax incentives under the
 26 16 redevelopment tax credit program and the housing enterprise
 26 17 zone tax incentives program if the property that is the subject
 26 18 of the project suffered a catastrophic fire during the 2014
 26 19 calendar year.
       LSB 1212HV (3) 86
       mm/sc
 17 32 the economic development authority may extend the project
 17 33 completion date for a project awarded tax incentives under both
 17 34 the redevelopment tax credit program in sections 15.293A and
 17 35 15.293B and the housing enterprise zone tax incentives program
 18  1 in section 15E.193B, Code 2014, if the property that is the
 18  2 subject of the project suffered a catastrophic fire during the
 18  3 2014 calendar year.
 18  4    Sec. 38.  EFFECTIVE UPON ENACTMENT.  The section of this
 18  5 division of this Act amending section 15.355, being deemed of
 18  6 immediate importance, takes effect upon enactment.
 18  7    Sec. 39.  RETROACTIVE APPLICABILITY.  The section of
 18  8 this division of this Act amending section 15.355 applies
 18  9 retroactively to July 1, 2014, for all agreements entered into
 18 10 pursuant to section 15.354 on or after that date.
 18 11                           EXPLANATION
 18 12 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
 18 13 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
 18 14    This bill relates to the administration of programs by the
 18 15 economic development authority (EDA) by creating a renewable
 18 16 chemical production tax credit, modifying the tax credit for
 18 17 investments in qualifying businesses and community=based seed
 18 18 capital funds, and modifying the entrepreneur investment awards
 18 19 program.
 18 20    DIVISION I ==== RENEWABLE CHEMICAL PRODUCTION TAX CREDIT.
 18 21   Division I creates a renewable chemical production tax credit
 18 22 program (program) that will be administered by the EDA and that
 18 23 will provide tax credits to eligible businesses that produce
 18 24 renewable chemicals in Iowa from biomass feedstock.  "Renewable
 18 25 chemical", "biomass feedstock", and other related terms are
 18 26 defined in the division.
 18 27    In order to qualify for the tax credit, a business must
 18 28 meet several requirements.  First, the business must be
 18 29 physically located in Iowa and operated for profit under
 18 30 single management.  Second, the business must not be an
 18 31 entity providing professional services, health care services,
 18 32 or medical treatments, or be engaged primarily in retail
 18 33 operations.  Third, the business must have organized, expanded,
 18 34 or located in Iowa on or after the effective date of the
 18 35 division.  Fourth, the business must not be, in the discretion
 19  1 of the EDA, ineligible under certain provisions relating to the
 19  2 relocation or reduction of business operations within Iowa.
 19  3 Fifth, the business must be in compliance with all agreements
 19  4 entered into under the program or other programs administered
 19  5 by the EDA.
 19  6    An eligible business seeking a tax credit is required
 19  7 to apply to the EDA during the calendar year following the
 19  8 calendar year in which the renewable chemicals are produced.
 19  9 The application must include the amount of renewable chemicals
 19 10 produced in Iowa from biomass feedstock by the eligible
 19 11 business during the calendar year, measured in pounds, and any
 19 12 other information reasonably required by the EDA in order to
 19 13 establish and verify eligibility under the program.  The EDA
 19 14 may accept applications on a continuous basis or may establish
 19 15 an annual application deadline.
 19 16    Before being issued a tax credit, an eligible business
 19 17 is required to enter into an agreement with the EDA for the
 19 18 successful completion of all requirements of the program.  The
 19 19 EDA is authorized to impose two compliance cost fees under the
 19 20 program.  The first fee equals $500 per agreement.  The second
 19 21 fee equals 0.5 percent of the value of the tax credit claimed
 19 22 pursuant to the agreement if the agreement has an aggregate tax
 19 23 credit value of $100,000 or greater.
 19 24    An eligible business that fails to comply with the
 19 25 requirements of the program or the terms of an agreement with
 19 26 the EDA may have its tax credits reduced, terminated, or
 19 27 rescinded, and may be subject to the repayment or recapture of
 19 28 claimed tax credits.
 19 29    Upon determining that all requirements of an agreement and
 19 30 the program have been fulfilled, the EDA shall issue a tax
 19 31 credit and related tax credit certificate to the eligible
 19 32 business in an amount equal to the product of $.05 multiplied
 19 33 by the number of pounds of renewable chemicals produced in Iowa
 19 34 from biomass feedstock by the eligible business during the
 19 35 calendar year.  Renewable chemicals produced by an eligible
 20  1 business prior to the effective date of the division, or
 20  2 prior to the date the business first qualifies as an eligible
 20  3 business, or after calendar year 2025, shall not qualify for
 20  4 the tax credit.
 20  5    The tax credit shall be claimed for the tax year during
 20  6 which the eligible business was issued the tax credit.  The tax
 20  7 credit may be claimed against the individual income tax and the
 20  8 corporate income tax.  The credit is refundable or may, at the
 20  9 election of the taxpayer, be carried forward for up to one tax
 20 10 year.   The tax credit shall not be transferred to any person.  A
 20 11 tax credit issued to a partnership, limited liability company,
 20 12 S corporation, cooperative organized under Code chapter 501
 20 13 and filing as a partnership for federal tax purposes, estate,
 20 14 or trust electing to have the income taxed directly to the
 20 15 individual may be claimed by the individual based upon the pro
 20 16 rata share of the individual's earnings from that entity.
 20 17    The division provides that the program is subject to the
 20 18 EDA's maximum aggregate tax credit cap of $170 million per
 20 19 fiscal year in Code section 15.119, and not more than $15
 20 20 million per fiscal year may be issued by the EDA under the
 20 21 program.  In addition, the maximum amount of tax credit that
 20 22 may be issued to an eligible business in any one calendar year
 20 23 shall not exceed $1 million or $500,000, depending on whether
 20 24 the eligible business has been operating in Iowa at the time of
 20 25 application for five or fewer years, or more than five years,
 20 26 respectively.  An eligible business shall not receive more than
 20 27 five tax credits under the program.  The EDA is required to
 20 28 issue tax credits on a first=come, first=served basis until the
 20 29 maximum amount of $15 million per fiscal year is reached.  If
 20 30 the amount of tax credits exceeds this amount in a fiscal year,
 20 31 the EDA is required to establish a wait list and give priority
 20 32 in subsequent years to the eligible businesses on the wait
 20 33 list.
 20 34    The division provides for the confidentiality of certain
 20 35 information under the program.  The identity of a tax credit
 21  1 recipient and the amount of the tax credit shall be considered
 21  2 public information under Code chapter 22 (examination of public
 21  3 records), but any other information or record in the possession
 21  4 of the EDA with respect to the program shall be presumed by
 21  5 the EDA to be a trade secret protected under Code chapter 550
 21  6 or common law and shall be kept confidential by the EDA unless
 21  7 otherwise ordered by a court.
 21  8    The division takes effect upon enactment and applies to
 21  9 renewable chemicals produced in Iowa from biomass feedstock on
 21 10 or after that date.  The division applies retroactively to tax
 21 11 years beginning on or after January 1, 2015.
 21 12    DIVISION II ==== ANGEL INVESTOR TAX CREDITS.   Division II
 21 13 makes several changes to the tax credit for investments in
 21 14 qualifying businesses and community=based seed capital funds,
 21 15 often referred to as the angel investor tax credits.  The
 21 16 division amends the purpose of the tax credit in Code section
 21 17 15E.41.  The division excludes investments in community=based
 21 18 seed capital funds from qualifying for the tax credit and
 21 19 makes several conforming amendments to remove references to
 21 20 community=based seed capital funds from the Code.
 21 21    The division modifies the amount and dollar limitation of
 21 22 the tax credit for a taxpayer.  The tax credit is increased
 21 23 from 20 percent to 25 percent of a taxpayer's equity investment
 21 24 in a qualifying business.  Under current law, a taxpayer cannot
 21 25 claim more than $50,000 of tax credit per investment in a
 21 26 qualifying business, and for each tax year a taxpayer and the
 21 27 taxpayer's affiliates cannot claim tax credits for more than
 21 28 five investments in five different qualifying businesses.  The
 21 29 division amends this dollar limitation to prohibit a natural
 21 30 person and the person's spouse, child, or sibling from claiming
 21 31 a combined amount of more than $100,000 in tax credits per tax
 21 32 year.
 21 33    The division also provides that no more than $500,000 in tax
 21 34 credits may be issued per tax year for equity investments in
 21 35 any one qualifying business.
 22  1 The division modifies the procedures for claiming the tax
 22  2 credit.  Under current law, the tax credit is not refundable
 22  3 but available for carryforward for up to five tax years.  The
 22  4 division makes the tax credit refundable for an investment
 22  5 made by a natural person, and for any other person reduces the
 22  6 carryforward period to three years.
 22  7    The division strikes a provision permitting the EDA
 22  8 to cooperate with small business development centers to
 22  9 disseminate information regarding the credits and to develop
 22 10 standard application forms, and requiring the EDA to distribute
 22 11 copies of the application forms to all community=based seed
 22 12 capital funds and potential individual investors.
 22 13    The division modifies the eligibility requirements for
 22 14 qualifying businesses.  The division strikes the requirement
 22 15 that a business have an owner that meets at least one of
 22 16 four qualifications relating to business education or
 22 17 business experience.  The division requires that a business
 22 18 be participating in an entrepreneurial assistance program,
 22 19 as defined in the division, but allows the EDA to waive this
 22 20 requirement if the business establishes that its owners,
 22 21 directors, officers, and employees have an appropriate level
 22 22 of experience such that an entrepreneurial assistance program
 22 23 would not materially change the prospects of the business.
 22 24 The EDA is allowed to consult with outside service providers
 22 25 in considering such a waiver.  The division increases from $5
 22 26 million to $10 million the maximum amount of net worth that
 22 27 a business may have to be considered a qualifying business.
 22 28 The division increases from $250,000 to $500,000 the amount of
 22 29 financing that a business must have in order to be considered a
 22 30 qualifying business, removes "near equity" from the types of
 22 31 financing that will be considered in that calculation, requires
 22 32 that the financing be secured at the time of application for
 22 33 the tax credits, and requires that the business have at least
 22 34 two investors at the time of application for the tax credits.
 22 35 These modified eligibility requirements apply to businesses
 23  1 that submit an application to the EDA to be registered as a
 23  2 qualifying business on or after the effective date of this
 23  3 division of the bill, and businesses that submitted such an
 23  4 application to the EDA before the effective date of this
 23  5 division of the bill shall be governed by current law.
 23  6    The division provides for the confidentiality of certain
 23  7 information with regard to the tax credit.  The identity of
 23  8 a qualifying business, the identity of an investor and the
 23  9 qualifying business in which the investor made an equity
 23 10 investment, and the total number and amount of tax credits
 23 11 issued shall be considered public information under Code
 23 12 chapter 22 (examination of public records), but any other
 23 13 information or record in the possession of the EDA with respect
 23 14 to the program shall be presumed by the EDA to be a trade secret
 23 15 protected under Code chapter 550 or common law and shall be
 23 16 kept confidential by the EDA unless otherwise ordered by a
 23 17 court.
 23 18    The division takes effect upon enactment and applies to
 23 19 equity investments in a qualifying business made on or after
 23 20 that date.  Equity investments in a qualifying business or
 23 21 community=based seed capital fund made prior to the effective
 23 22 date of the division shall be governed by current law.
 23 23    DIVISION III ==== ENTREPRENEUR INVESTMENT AWARDS PROGRAM.
 23 24  Division III amends the entrepreneur investment awards program
 23 25 administered by the EDA.  The division strikes provisions that
 23 26 prohibited the EDA from making awards under the program since
 23 27 July 1, 2014, and that required the EDA by December 31, 2014,
 23 28 to conduct a comprehensive review of the program and submit
 23 29 a report with specified information to the governor and the
 23 30 general assembly.
 23 31    The division modifies the purpose of the program to be
 23 32 to provide financial assistance to eligible entrepreneurial
 23 33 assistance providers (provider) that provide technical and
 23 34 financial assistance to entrepreneurs and start=up companies
 23 35 seeking to create, locate, or expand a business in Iowa.
 24  1 "Financial assistance" is defined in the division.
 24  2    The division changes the requirements for receiving an
 24  3 award.  To be eligible to receive an award under current
 24  4 law, an entrepreneurial assistance program must have been
 24  5 an Iowa=based business, expended at least $500,000 during
 24  6 the previous fiscal year to provide technical and financial
 24  7 assistance services that meet the broad=based needs of
 24  8 entrepreneurs seeking to create, locate, or expand a business
 24  9 in Iowa that intends to derive more than 10 percent of its
 24 10 gross sales from markets outside Iowa; and must have engaged
 24 11 and communicated with certain other programs, funding sources,
 24 12 and entities for its entrepreneur clients.  The division
 24 13 amends the eligibility for receiving financial assistance to
 24 14 require that a provider have its principal place of operations
 24 15 in Iowa and that the provider offer a comprehensive set of
 24 16 business development services to emerging and early=stage
 24 17 innovation companies to assist in the creation, location,
 24 18 growth, and long=term success of the company in Iowa.
 24 19 "Business development services" is defined in the division.
 24 20 Business development services may be performed at the physical
 24 21 location of the provider or the company and may be provided in
 24 22 consideration of equity participation in the company, a fee for
 24 23 services, or a membership agreement with the company.
 24 24    Under current law, the EDA board could approve, deny, or
 24 25 defer each application for a grant, and was required to award
 24 26 grants on a first=come, first=served basis.  The division
 24 27 specifies that the EDA board has the discretion to approve,
 24 28 deny, or defer each application for financial assistance and
 24 29 that the amount of financial assistance awarded to a provider
 24 30 is within the discretion of the EDA.  The division requires
 24 31 the EDA to award financial assistance on a competitive basis
 24 32 and allows the EDA to develop scoring criteria and establish
 24 33 minimum requirements for the receipt of a financial assistance
 24 34 award.
 24 35    In addition to the four factors relating to the provider's
 25  1 professional staff that the EDA may consider under current
 25  2 law in deciding whether to award financial assistance, the
 25  3 division provides that the EDA may also consider the service
 25  4 model and likelihood of success of the provider, the provider's
 25  5 similarity to other successful providers in the country, and
 25  6 the provider's financial need.
 25  7    The division modifies the maximum award amount for a
 25  8 recipient.  Under current law, a grant to an entrepreneur
 25  9 assistance program cannot exceed the lesser of 25 percent of
 25 10 the funds expended by the program during the previous fiscal
 25 11 year, 100 percent of the funds raised from certain persons
 25 12 by the program during the previous fiscal year, or $200,000.
 25 13 The division provides that the amount of financial assistance
 25 14 awarded to any one provider shall not exceed $200,000.
 25 15    The division modifies the permitted use of funds received
 25 16 under the program.  Under current law, grants are only
 25 17 permitted to be used for the purpose of operating costs
 25 18 incurred by the program.  The division specifies that financial
 25 19 assistance awarded to a provider shall only be used for
 25 20 the purpose of operating costs incurred by the provider in
 25 21 the provision of business development services to emerging
 25 22 and early=stage innovation companies in Iowa.  The division
 25 23 further requires that such financial assistance shall not be
 25 24 distributed to owners or investors of the company to which the
 25 25 business development services are being provided and shall not
 25 26 be provided to other persons assisting with the provision of
 25 27 the services.
 25 28    Under current law, an entrepreneurial assistance provider is
 25 29 required to accept client referrals from the EDA as a condition
 25 30 of receiving a grant.  The division provides that the EDA may
 25 31 make client referrals to eligible providers.
 25 32    DIVISION IV ==== MISCELLANEOUS CHANGES.  Division IV makes
 25 33 several miscellaneous changes to other EDA programs.  The
 25 34 division amends the sales and use tax refund available under
 25 35 the workforce housing tax incentive program.  That refund
 26  1 is available for sales and use tax paid prior to project
 26  2 completion, which is currently defined to mean the first date
 26  3 upon which the average annualized production of finished
 26  4 product for the preceding 90=day period at the manufacturing
 26  5 facility operated by the eligible business is at least 50
 26  6 percent of the initial design capacity of the facility.  The
 26  7 division amends the definition of "project completion" to mean
 26  8 the date on which the EDA notifies the department of revenue
 26  9 that all applicable requirements of a workforce housing tax

 18 11                           EXPLANATION
 18 12 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
 18 13 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
 18 14    This bill relates to the administration of programs by the
 18 15 economic development authority (EDA) by creating a renewable
 18 16 chemical production tax credit, modifying the tax credit for
 18 17 investments in qualifying businesses and community=based seed
 18 18 capital funds, and modifying the entrepreneur investment awards
 18 19 program.
 18 20    DIVISION I ==== RENEWABLE CHEMICAL PRODUCTION TAX CREDIT.
 18 21   Division I creates a renewable chemical production tax credit
 18 22 program (program) that will be administered by the EDA and that
 18 23 will provide tax credits to eligible businesses that produce
 18 24 renewable chemicals in Iowa from biomass feedstock.  "Renewable
 18 25 chemical", "biomass feedstock", and other related terms are
 18 26 defined in the division.
 18 27    In order to qualify for the tax credit, a business must
 18 28 meet several requirements.  First, the business must be
 18 29 physically located in Iowa and operated for profit under
 18 30 single management.  Second, the business must not be an
 18 31 entity providing professional services, health care services,
 18 32 or medical treatments, or be engaged primarily in retail
 18 33 operations.  Third, the business must have organized, expanded,
 18 34 or located in Iowa on or after the effective date of the
 18 35 division.  Fourth, the business must not be, in the discretion
 19  1 of the EDA, ineligible under certain provisions relating to the
 19  2 relocation or reduction of business operations within Iowa.
 19  3 Fifth, the business must be in compliance with all agreements
 19  4 entered into under the program or other programs administered
 19  5 by the EDA.
 19  6    An eligible business seeking a tax credit is required
 19  7 to apply to the EDA during the calendar year following the
 19  8 calendar year in which the renewable chemicals are produced.
 19  9 The application must include the amount of renewable chemicals
 19 10 produced in Iowa from biomass feedstock by the eligible
 19 11 business during the calendar year, measured in pounds, and any
 19 12 other information reasonably required by the EDA in order to
 19 13 establish and verify eligibility under the program.  The EDA
 19 14 may accept applications on a continuous basis or may establish
 19 15 an annual application deadline.
 19 16    Before being issued a tax credit, an eligible business
 19 17 is required to enter into an agreement with the EDA for the
 19 18 successful completion of all requirements of the program.  The
 19 19 EDA is authorized to impose two compliance cost fees under the
 19 20 program.  The first fee equals $500 per agreement.  The second
 19 21 fee equals 0.5 percent of the value of the tax credit claimed
 19 22 pursuant to the agreement if the agreement has an aggregate tax
 19 23 credit value of $100,000 or greater.
 19 24    An eligible business that fails to comply with the
 19 25 requirements of the program or the terms of an agreement with
 19 26 the EDA may have its tax credits reduced, terminated, or
 19 27 rescinded, and may be subject to the repayment or recapture of
 19 28 claimed tax credits.
 19 29    Upon determining that all requirements of an agreement and
 19 30 the program have been fulfilled, the EDA shall issue a tax
 19 31 credit and related tax credit certificate to the eligible
 19 32 business in an amount equal to the product of $.05 multiplied
 19 33 by the number of pounds of renewable chemicals produced in Iowa
 19 34 from biomass feedstock by the eligible business during the
 19 35 calendar year.  Renewable chemicals produced by an eligible
 20  1 business prior to the effective date of the division, or
 20  2 prior to the date the business first qualifies as an eligible
 20  3 business, or after calendar year 2025, shall not qualify for
 20  4 the tax credit.
 20  5    The tax credit shall be claimed for the tax year during
 20  6 which the eligible business was issued the tax credit.  The tax
 20  7 credit may be claimed against the individual income tax and the
 20  8 corporate income tax.  The credit is refundable or may, at the
 20  9 election of the taxpayer, be carried forward for up to one tax
 20 10 year.   The tax credit shall not be transferred to any person.  A
 20 11 tax credit issued to a partnership, limited liability company,
 20 12 S corporation, cooperative organized under Code chapter 501
 20 13 and filing as a partnership for federal tax purposes, estate,
 20 14 or trust electing to have the income taxed directly to the
 20 15 individual may be claimed by the individual based upon the pro
 20 16 rata share of the individual's earnings from that entity.
 20 17    The division provides that the program is subject to the
 20 18 EDA's maximum aggregate tax credit cap of $170 million per
 20 19 fiscal year in Code section 15.119, and not more than $15
 20 20 million per fiscal year may be issued by the EDA under the
 20 21 program.  In addition, the maximum amount of tax credit that
 20 22 may be issued to an eligible business in any one calendar year
 20 23 shall not exceed $1 million or $500,000, depending on whether
 20 24 the eligible business has been operating in Iowa at the time of
 20 25 application for five or fewer years, or more than five years,
 20 26 respectively.  An eligible business shall not receive more than
 20 27 five tax credits under the program.  The EDA is required to
 20 28 issue tax credits on a first=come, first=served basis until the
 20 29 maximum amount of $15 million per fiscal year is reached.  If
 20 30 the amount of tax credits exceeds this amount in a fiscal year,
 20 31 the EDA is required to establish a wait list and give priority
 20 32 in subsequent years to the eligible businesses on the wait
 20 33 list.
 20 34    The division provides for the confidentiality of certain
 20 35 information under the program.  The identity of a tax credit
 21  1 recipient and the amount of the tax credit shall be considered
 21  2 public information under Code chapter 22 (examination of public
 21  3 records), but any other information or record in the possession
 21  4 of the EDA with respect to the program shall be presumed by
 21  5 the EDA to be a trade secret protected under Code chapter 550
 21  6 or common law and shall be kept confidential by the EDA unless
 21  7 otherwise ordered by a court.
 21  8    The division takes effect upon enactment and applies to
 21  9 renewable chemicals produced in Iowa from biomass feedstock on
 21 10 or after that date.  The division applies retroactively to tax
 21 11 years beginning on or after January 1, 2015.
 21 12    DIVISION II ==== ANGEL INVESTOR TAX CREDITS.   Division II
 21 13 makes several changes to the tax credit for investments in
 21 14 qualifying businesses and community=based seed capital funds,
 21 15 often referred to as the angel investor tax credits.  The
 21 16 division amends the purpose of the tax credit in Code section
 21 17 15E.41.  The division excludes investments in community=based
 21 18 seed capital funds from qualifying for the tax credit and
 21 19 makes several conforming amendments to remove references to
 21 20 community=based seed capital funds from the Code.
 21 21    The division modifies the amount and dollar limitation of
 21 22 the tax credit for a taxpayer.  The tax credit is increased
 21 23 from 20 percent to 25 percent of a taxpayer's equity investment
 21 24 in a qualifying business.  Under current law, a taxpayer cannot
 21 25 claim more than $50,000 of tax credit per investment in a
 21 26 qualifying business, and for each tax year a taxpayer and the
 21 27 taxpayer's affiliates cannot claim tax credits for more than
 21 28 five investments in five different qualifying businesses.  The
 21 29 division amends this dollar limitation to prohibit a natural
 21 30 person and the person's spouse, child, or sibling from claiming
 21 31 a combined amount of more than $100,000 in tax credits per tax
 21 32 year.
 21 33    The division also provides that no more than $500,000 in tax
 21 34 credits may be issued per tax year for equity investments in
 21 35 any one qualifying business.
 22  1 The division modifies the procedures for claiming the tax
 22  2 credit.  Under current law, the tax credit is not refundable
 22  3 but available for carryforward for up to five tax years.  The
 22  4 division makes the tax credit refundable for an investment
 22  5 made by a natural person, and for any other person reduces the
 22  6 carryforward period to three years.
 22  7    The division strikes a provision permitting the EDA
 22  8 to cooperate with small business development centers to
 22  9 disseminate information regarding the credits and to develop
 22 10 standard application forms, and requiring the EDA to distribute
 22 11 copies of the application forms to all community=based seed
 22 12 capital funds and potential individual investors.
 22 13    The division modifies the eligibility requirements for
 22 14 qualifying businesses.  The division strikes the requirement
 22 15 that a business have an owner that meets at least one of
 22 16 four qualifications relating to business education or
 22 17 business experience.  The division requires that a business
 22 18 be participating in an entrepreneurial assistance program,
 22 19 as defined in the division, but allows the EDA to waive this
 22 20 requirement if the business establishes that its owners,
 22 21 directors, officers, and employees have an appropriate level
 22 22 of experience such that an entrepreneurial assistance program
 22 23 would not materially change the prospects of the business.
 22 24 The EDA is allowed to consult with outside service providers
 22 25 in considering such a waiver.  The division increases from $5
 22 26 million to $10 million the maximum amount of net worth that
 22 27 a business may have to be considered a qualifying business.
 22 28 The division increases from $250,000 to $500,000 the amount of
 22 29 financing that a business must have in order to be considered a
 22 30 qualifying business, removes "near equity" from the types of
 22 31 financing that will be considered in that calculation, requires
 22 32 that the financing be secured at the time of application for
 22 33 the tax credits, and requires that the business have at least
 22 34 two investors at the time of application for the tax credits.
 22 35 These modified eligibility requirements apply to businesses
 23  1 that submit an application to the EDA to be registered as a
 23  2 qualifying business on or after the effective date of this
 23  3 division of the bill, and businesses that submitted such an
 23  4 application to the EDA before the effective date of this
 23  5 division of the bill shall be governed by current law.
 23  6    The division provides for the confidentiality of certain
 23  7 information with regard to the tax credit.  The identity of
 23  8 a qualifying business, the identity of an investor and the
 23  9 qualifying business in which the investor made an equity
 23 10 investment, and the total number and amount of tax credits
 23 11 issued shall be considered public information under Code
 23 12 chapter 22 (examination of public records), but any other
 23 13 information or record in the possession of the EDA with respect
 23 14 to the program shall be presumed by the EDA to be a trade secret
 23 15 protected under Code chapter 550 or common law and shall be
 23 16 kept confidential by the EDA unless otherwise ordered by a
 23 17 court.
 23 18    The division takes effect upon enactment and applies to
 23 19 equity investments in a qualifying business made on or after
 23 20 that date.  Equity investments in a qualifying business or
 23 21 community=based seed capital fund made prior to the effective
 23 22 date of the division shall be governed by current law.
 23 23    DIVISION III ==== ENTREPRENEUR INVESTMENT AWARDS PROGRAM.
 23 24  Division III amends the entrepreneur investment awards program
 23 25 administered by the EDA.  The division strikes provisions that
 23 26 prohibited the EDA from making awards under the program since
 23 27 July 1, 2014, and that required the EDA by December 31, 2014,
 23 28 to conduct a comprehensive review of the program and submit
 23 29 a report with specified information to the governor and the
 23 30 general assembly.
 23 31    The division modifies the purpose of the program to be
 23 32 to provide financial assistance to eligible entrepreneurial
 23 33 assistance providers (provider) that provide technical and
 23 34 financial assistance to entrepreneurs and start=up companies
 23 35 seeking to create, locate, or expand a business in Iowa.
 24  1 "Financial assistance" is defined in the division.
 24  2    The division changes the requirements for receiving an
 24  3 award.  To be eligible to receive an award under current
 24  4 law, an entrepreneurial assistance program must have been
 24  5 an Iowa=based business, expended at least $500,000 during
 24  6 the previous fiscal year to provide technical and financial
 24  7 assistance services that meet the broad=based needs of
 24  8 entrepreneurs seeking to create, locate, or expand a business
 24  9 in Iowa that intends to derive more than 10 percent of its
 24 10 gross sales from markets outside Iowa; and must have engaged
 24 11 and communicated with certain other programs, funding sources,
 24 12 and entities for its entrepreneur clients.  The division
 24 13 amends the eligibility for receiving financial assistance to
 24 14 require that a provider have its principal place of operations
 24 15 in Iowa and that the provider offer a comprehensive set of
 24 16 business development services to emerging and early=stage
 24 17 innovation companies to assist in the creation, location,
 24 18 growth, and long=term success of the company in Iowa.
 24 19 "Business development services" is defined in the division.
 24 20 Business development services may be performed at the physical
 24 21 location of the provider or the company and may be provided in
 24 22 consideration of equity participation in the company, a fee for
 24 23 services, or a membership agreement with the company.
 24 24    Under current law, the EDA board could approve, deny, or
 24 25 defer each application for a grant, and was required to award
 24 26 grants on a first=come, first=served basis.  The division
 24 27 specifies that the EDA board has the discretion to approve,
 24 28 deny, or defer each application for financial assistance and
 24 29 that the amount of financial assistance awarded to a provider
 24 30 is within the discretion of the EDA.  The division requires
 24 31 the EDA to award financial assistance on a competitive basis
 24 32 and allows the EDA to develop scoring criteria and establish
 24 33 minimum requirements for the receipt of a financial assistance
 24 34 award.
 24 35    In addition to the four factors relating to the provider's
 25  1 professional staff that the EDA may consider under current
 25  2 law in deciding whether to award financial assistance, the
 25  3 division provides that the EDA may also consider the service
 25  4 model and likelihood of success of the provider, the provider's
 25  5 similarity to other successful providers in the country, and
 25  6 the provider's financial need.
 25  7    The division modifies the maximum award amount for a
 25  8 recipient.  Under current law, a grant to an entrepreneur
 25  9 assistance program cannot exceed the lesser of 25 percent of
 25 10 the funds expended by the program during the previous fiscal
 25 11 year, 100 percent of the funds raised from certain persons
 25 12 by the program during the previous fiscal year, or $200,000.
 25 13 The division provides that the amount of financial assistance
 25 14 awarded to any one provider shall not exceed $200,000.
 25 15    The division modifies the permitted use of funds received
 25 16 under the program.  Under current law, grants are only
 25 17 permitted to be used for the purpose of operating costs
 25 18 incurred by the program.  The division specifies that financial
 25 19 assistance awarded to a provider shall only be used for
 25 20 the purpose of operating costs incurred by the provider in
 25 21 the provision of business development services to emerging
 25 22 and early=stage innovation companies in Iowa.  The division
 25 23 further requires that such financial assistance shall not be
 25 24 distributed to owners or investors of the company to which the
 25 25 business development services are being provided and shall not
 25 26 be provided to other persons assisting with the provision of
 25 27 the services.
 25 28    Under current law, an entrepreneurial assistance provider is
 25 29 required to accept client referrals from the EDA as a condition
 25 30 of receiving a grant.  The division provides that the EDA may
 25 31 make client referrals to eligible providers.
 25 32    DIVISION IV ==== MISCELLANEOUS CHANGES.  Division IV makes
 25 33 several miscellaneous changes to other EDA programs.  The
 25 34 division amends the sales and use tax refund available under
 25 35 the workforce housing tax incentive program.  That refund
 26  1 is available for sales and use tax paid prior to project
 26  2 completion, which is currently defined to mean the first date
 26  3 upon which the average annualized production of finished
 26  4 product for the preceding 90=day period at the manufacturing
 26  5 facility operated by the eligible business is at least 50
 26  6 percent of the initial design capacity of the facility.  The
 26  7 division amends the definition of "project completion" to mean
 26  8 the date on which the EDA notifies the department of revenue
 26  9 that all applicable requirements of a workforce housing tax
 26 10 incentive program agreement are satisfied.  This provision
 26 11 takes effect upon enactment and applies retroactively to July
 26 12 1, 2014, for all workforce housing tax incentive agreements
 26 13 entered into on or after that date.
 26 14    The division allows the EDA to extend the project
 26 15 completion date for a project awarded tax incentives under the
 26 16 redevelopment tax credit program and the housing enterprise
 26 17 zone tax incentives program if the property that is the subject
 26 18 of the project suffered a catastrophic fire during the 2014
 26 19 calendar year.

 18 11                           EXPLANATION
 18 12 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
 18 13 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
 18 14    This bill relates to the administration of programs by the
 18 15 economic development authority (EDA) by creating a renewable
 18 16 chemical production tax credit, modifying the tax credit for
 18 17 investments in qualifying businesses and community=based seed
 18 18 capital funds, and modifying the entrepreneur investment awards
 18 19 program.
 18 20    DIVISION I ==== RENEWABLE CHEMICAL PRODUCTION TAX CREDIT.
 18 21   Division I creates a renewable chemical production tax credit
 18 22 program (program) that will be administered by the EDA and that
 18 23 will provide tax credits to eligible businesses that produce
 18 24 renewable chemicals in Iowa from biomass feedstock.  "Renewable
 18 25 chemical", "biomass feedstock", and other related terms are
 18 26 defined in the division.
 18 27    In order to qualify for the tax credit, a business must
 18 28 meet several requirements.  First, the business must be
 18 29 physically located in Iowa and operated for profit under
 18 30 single management.  Second, the business must not be an
 18 31 entity providing professional services, health care services,
 18 32 or medical treatments, or be engaged primarily in retail
 18 33 operations.  Third, the business must have organized, expanded,
 18 34 or located in Iowa on or after the effective date of the
 18 35 division.  Fourth, the business must not be, in the discretion
 19  1 of the EDA, ineligible under certain provisions relating to the
 19  2 relocation or reduction of business operations within Iowa.
 19  3 Fifth, the business must be in compliance with all agreements
 19  4 entered into under the program or other programs administered
 19  5 by the EDA.
 19  6    An eligible business seeking a tax credit is required
 19  7 to apply to the EDA during the calendar year following the
 19  8 calendar year in which the renewable chemicals are produced.
 19  9 The application must include the amount of renewable chemicals
 19 10 produced in Iowa from biomass feedstock by the eligible
 19 11 business during the calendar year, measured in pounds, and any
 19 12 other information reasonably required by the EDA in order to
 19 13 establish and verify eligibility under the program.  The EDA
 19 14 may accept applications on a continuous basis or may establish
 19 15 an annual application deadline.
 19 16    Before being issued a tax credit, an eligible business
 19 17 is required to enter into an agreement with the EDA for the
 19 18 successful completion of all requirements of the program.  The
 19 19 EDA is authorized to impose two compliance cost fees under the
 19 20 program.  The first fee equals $500 per agreement.  The second
 19 21 fee equals 0.5 percent of the value of the tax credit claimed
 19 22 pursuant to the agreement if the agreement has an aggregate tax
 19 23 credit value of $100,000 or greater.
 19 24    An eligible business that fails to comply with the
 19 25 requirements of the program or the terms of an agreement with
 19 26 the EDA may have its tax credits reduced, terminated, or
 19 27 rescinded, and may be subject to the repayment or recapture of
 19 28 claimed tax credits.
 19 29    Upon determining that all requirements of an agreement and
 19 30 the program have been fulfilled, the EDA shall issue a tax
 19 31 credit and related tax credit certificate to the eligible
 19 32 business in an amount equal to the product of $.05 multiplied
 19 33 by the number of pounds of renewable chemicals produced in Iowa
 19 34 from biomass feedstock by the eligible business during the
 19 35 calendar year.  Renewable chemicals produced by an eligible
 20  1 business prior to the effective date of the division, or
 20  2 prior to the date the business first qualifies as an eligible
 20  3 business, or after calendar year 2025, shall not qualify for
 20  4 the tax credit.
 20  5    The tax credit shall be claimed for the tax year during
 20  6 which the eligible business was issued the tax credit.  The tax
 20  7 credit may be claimed against the individual income tax and the
 20  8 corporate income tax.  The credit is refundable or may, at the
 20  9 election of the taxpayer, be carried forward for up to one tax
 20 10 year.   The tax credit shall not be transferred to any person.  A
 20 11 tax credit issued to a partnership, limited liability company,
 20 12 S corporation, cooperative organized under Code chapter 501
 20 13 and filing as a partnership for federal tax purposes, estate,
 20 14 or trust electing to have the income taxed directly to the
 20 15 individual may be claimed by the individual based upon the pro
 20 16 rata share of the individual's earnings from that entity.
 20 17    The division provides that the program is subject to the
 20 18 EDA's maximum aggregate tax credit cap of $170 million per
 20 19 fiscal year in Code section 15.119, and not more than $15
 20 20 million per fiscal year may be issued by the EDA under the
 20 21 program.  In addition, the maximum amount of tax credit that
 20 22 may be issued to an eligible business in any one calendar year
 20 23 shall not exceed $1 million or $500,000, depending on whether
 20 24 the eligible business has been operating in Iowa at the time of
 20 25 application for five or fewer years, or more than five years,
 20 26 respectively.  An eligible business shall not receive more than
 20 27 five tax credits under the program.  The EDA is required to
 20 28 issue tax credits on a first=come, first=served basis until the
 20 29 maximum amount of $15 million per fiscal year is reached.  If
 20 30 the amount of tax credits exceeds this amount in a fiscal year,
 20 31 the EDA is required to establish a wait list and give priority
 20 32 in subsequent years to the eligible businesses on the wait
 20 33 list.
 20 34    The division provides for the confidentiality of certain
 20 35 information under the program.  The identity of a tax credit
 21  1 recipient and the amount of the tax credit shall be considered
 21  2 public information under Code chapter 22 (examination of public
 21  3 records), but any other information or record in the possession
 21  4 of the EDA with respect to the program shall be presumed by
 21  5 the EDA to be a trade secret protected under Code chapter 550
 21  6 or common law and shall be kept confidential by the EDA unless
 21  7 otherwise ordered by a court.
 21  8    The division takes effect upon enactment and applies to
 21  9 renewable chemicals produced in Iowa from biomass feedstock on
 21 10 or after that date.  The division applies retroactively to tax
 21 11 years beginning on or after January 1, 2015.
 21 12    DIVISION II ==== ANGEL INVESTOR TAX CREDITS.   Division II
 21 13 makes several changes to the tax credit for investments in
 21 14 qualifying businesses and community=based seed capital funds,
 21 15 often referred to as the angel investor tax credits.  The
 21 16 division amends the purpose of the tax credit in Code section
 21 17 15E.41.  The division excludes investments in community=based
 21 18 seed capital funds from qualifying for the tax credit and
 21 19 makes several conforming amendments to remove references to
 21 20 community=based seed capital funds from the Code.
 21 21    The division modifies the amount and dollar limitation of
 21 22 the tax credit for a taxpayer.  The tax credit is increased
 21 23 from 20 percent to 25 percent of a taxpayer's equity investment
 21 24 in a qualifying business.  Under current law, a taxpayer cannot
 21 25 claim more than $50,000 of tax credit per investment in a
 21 26 qualifying business, and for each tax year a taxpayer and the
 21 27 taxpayer's affiliates cannot claim tax credits for more than
 21 28 five investments in five different qualifying businesses.  The
 21 29 division amends this dollar limitation to prohibit a natural
 21 30 person and the person's spouse, child, or sibling from claiming
 21 31 a combined amount of more than $100,000 in tax credits per tax
 21 32 year.
 21 33    The division also provides that no more than $500,000 in tax
 21 34 credits may be issued per tax year for equity investments in
 21 35 any one qualifying business.
 22  1 The division modifies the procedures for claiming the tax
 22  2 credit.  Under current law, the tax credit is not refundable
 22  3 but available for carryforward for up to five tax years.  The
 22  4 division makes the tax credit refundable for an investment
 22  5 made by a natural person, and for any other person reduces the
 22  6 carryforward period to three years.
 22  7    The division strikes a provision permitting the EDA
 22  8 to cooperate with small business development centers to
 22  9 disseminate information regarding the credits and to develop
 22 10 standard application forms, and requiring the EDA to distribute
 22 11 copies of the application forms to all community=based seed
 22 12 capital funds and potential individual investors.
 22 13    The division modifies the eligibility requirements for
 22 14 qualifying businesses.  The division strikes the requirement
 22 15 that a business have an owner that meets at least one of
 22 16 four qualifications relating to business education or
 22 17 business experience.  The division requires that a business
 22 18 be participating in an entrepreneurial assistance program,
 22 19 as defined in the division, but allows the EDA to waive this
 22 20 requirement if the business establishes that its owners,
 22 21 directors, officers, and employees have an appropriate level
 22 22 of experience such that an entrepreneurial assistance program
 22 23 would not materially change the prospects of the business.
 22 24 The EDA is allowed to consult with outside service providers
 22 25 in considering such a waiver.  The division increases from $5
 22 26 million to $10 million the maximum amount of net worth that
 22 27 a business may have to be considered a qualifying business.
 22 28 The division increases from $250,000 to $500,000 the amount of
 22 29 financing that a business must have in order to be considered a
 22 30 qualifying business, removes "near equity" from the types of
 22 31 financing that will be considered in that calculation, requires
 22 32 that the financing be secured at the time of application for
 22 33 the tax credits, and requires that the business have at least
 22 34 two investors at the time of application for the tax credits.
 22 35 These modified eligibility requirements apply to businesses
 23  1 that submit an application to the EDA to be registered as a
 23  2 qualifying business on or after the effective date of this
 23  3 division of the bill, and businesses that submitted such an
 23  4 application to the EDA before the effective date of this
 23  5 division of the bill shall be governed by current law.
 23  6    The division provides for the confidentiality of certain
 23  7 information with regard to the tax credit.  The identity of
 23  8 a qualifying business, the identity of an investor and the
 23  9 qualifying business in which the investor made an equity
 23 10 investment, and the total number and amount of tax credits
 23 11 issued shall be considered public information under Code
 23 12 chapter 22 (examination of public records), but any other
 23 13 information or record in the possession of the EDA with respect
 23 14 to the program shall be presumed by the EDA to be a trade secret
 23 15 protected under Code chapter 550 or common law and shall be
 23 16 kept confidential by the EDA unless otherwise ordered by a
 23 17 court.
 23 18    The division takes effect upon enactment and applies to
 23 19 equity investments in a qualifying business made on or after
 23 20 that date.  Equity investments in a qualifying business or
 23 21 community=based seed capital fund made prior to the effective
 23 22 date of the division shall be governed by current law.
 23 23    DIVISION III ==== ENTREPRENEUR INVESTMENT AWARDS PROGRAM.
 23 24  Division III amends the entrepreneur investment awards program
 23 25 administered by the EDA.  The division strikes provisions that
 23 26 prohibited the EDA from making awards under the program since
 23 27 July 1, 2014, and that required the EDA by December 31, 2014,
 23 28 to conduct a comprehensive review of the program and submit
 23 29 a report with specified information to the governor and the
 23 30 general assembly.
 23 31    The division modifies the purpose of the program to be
 23 32 to provide financial assistance to eligible entrepreneurial
 23 33 assistance providers (provider) that provide technical and
 23 34 financial assistance to entrepreneurs and start=up companies
 23 35 seeking to create, locate, or expand a business in Iowa.
 24  1 "Financial assistance" is defined in the division.
 24  2    The division changes the requirements for receiving an
 24  3 award.  To be eligible to receive an award under current
 24  4 law, an entrepreneurial assistance program must have been
 24  5 an Iowa=based business, expended at least $500,000 during
 24  6 the previous fiscal year to provide technical and financial
 24  7 assistance services that meet the broad=based needs of
 24  8 entrepreneurs seeking to create, locate, or expand a business
 24  9 in Iowa that intends to derive more than 10 percent of its
 24 10 gross sales from markets outside Iowa; and must have engaged
 24 11 and communicated with certain other programs, funding sources,
 24 12 and entities for its entrepreneur clients.  The division
 24 13 amends the eligibility for receiving financial assistance to
 24 14 require that a provider have its principal place of operations
 24 15 in Iowa and that the provider offer a comprehensive set of
 24 16 business development services to emerging and early=stage
 24 17 innovation companies to assist in the creation, location,
 24 18 growth, and long=term success of the company in Iowa.
 24 19 "Business development services" is defined in the division.
 24 20 Business development services may be performed at the physical
 24 21 location of the provider or the company and may be provided in
 24 22 consideration of equity participation in the company, a fee for
 24 23 services, or a membership agreement with the company.
 24 24    Under current law, the EDA board could approve, deny, or
 24 25 defer each application for a grant, and was required to award
 24 26 grants on a first=come, first=served basis.  The division
 24 27 specifies that the EDA board has the discretion to approve,
 24 28 deny, or defer each application for financial assistance and
 24 29 that the amount of financial assistance awarded to a provider
 24 30 is within the discretion of the EDA.  The division requires
 24 31 the EDA to award financial assistance on a competitive basis
 24 32 and allows the EDA to develop scoring criteria and establish
 24 33 minimum requirements for the receipt of a financial assistance
 24 34 award.
 24 35    In addition to the four factors relating to the provider's
 25  1 professional staff that the EDA may consider under current
 25  2 law in deciding whether to award financial assistance, the
 25  3 division provides that the EDA may also consider the service
 25  4 model and likelihood of success of the provider, the provider's
 25  5 similarity to other successful providers in the country, and
 25  6 the provider's financial need.
 25  7    The division modifies the maximum award amount for a
 25  8 recipient.  Under current law, a grant to an entrepreneur
 25  9 assistance program cannot exceed the lesser of 25 percent of
 25 10 the funds expended by the program during the previous fiscal
 25 11 year, 100 percent of the funds raised from certain persons
 25 12 by the program during the previous fiscal year, or $200,000.
 25 13 The division provides that the amount of financial assistance
 25 14 awarded to any one provider shall not exceed $200,000.
 25 15    The division modifies the permitted use of funds received
 25 16 under the program.  Under current law, grants are only
 25 17 permitted to be used for the purpose of operating costs
 25 18 incurred by the program.  The division specifies that financial
 25 19 assistance awarded to a provider shall only be used for
 25 20 the purpose of operating costs incurred by the provider in
 25 21 the provision of business development services to emerging
 25 22 and early=stage innovation companies in Iowa.  The division
 25 23 further requires that such financial assistance shall not be
 25 24 distributed to owners or investors of the company to which the
 25 25 business development services are being provided and shall not
 25 26 be provided to other persons assisting with the provision of
 25 27 the services.
 25 28    Under current law, an entrepreneurial assistance provider is
 25 29 required to accept client referrals from the EDA as a condition
 25 30 of receiving a grant.  The division provides that the EDA may
 25 31 make client referrals to eligible providers.
 25 32    DIVISION IV ==== MISCELLANEOUS CHANGES.  Division IV makes
 25 33 several miscellaneous changes to other EDA programs.  The
 25 34 division amends the sales and use tax refund available under
 25 35 the workforce housing tax incentive program.  That refund
 26  1 is available for sales and use tax paid prior to project
 26  2 completion, which is currently defined to mean the first date
 26  3 upon which the average annualized production of finished
 26  4 product for the preceding 90=day period at the manufacturing
 26  5 facility operated by the eligible business is at least 50
 26  6 percent of the initial design capacity of the facility.  The
 26  7 division amends the definition of "project completion" to mean
 26  8 the date on which the EDA notifies the department of revenue
 26  9 that all applicable requirements of a workforce housing tax
 26 10 incentive program agreement are satisfied.  This provision
 26 11 takes effect upon enactment and applies retroactively to July
 26 12 1, 2014, for all workforce housing tax incentive agreements
 26 13 entered into on or after that date.
 26 14    The division allows the EDA to extend the project
 26 15 completion date for a project awarded tax incentives under the
 26 16 redevelopment tax credit program and the housing enterprise
 26 17 zone tax incentives program if the property that is the subject
 26 18 of the project suffered a catastrophic fire during the 2014
 26 19 calendar year.
       LSB 1212HV (3) 86
       mm/sc
 17 35 15.293B and the housing enterprise zone tax incentives program
 18  1 in section 15E.193B, Code 2014, if the property that is the
 18  2 subject of the project suffered a catastrophic fire during the
 18  3 2014 calendar year.
 18  4    Sec. 38.  EFFECTIVE UPON ENACTMENT.  The section of this
 18  5 division of this Act amending section 15.355, being deemed of
 18  6 immediate importance, takes effect upon enactment.
 18  7    Sec. 39.  RETROACTIVE APPLICABILITY.  The section of
 18  8 this division of this Act amending section 15.355 applies
 18  9 retroactively to July 1, 2014, for all agreements entered into
 18 10 pursuant to section 15.354 on or after that date.
 18 11                           EXPLANATION
 18 12 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
 18 13 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
 18 14    This bill relates to the administration of programs by the
 18 15 economic development authority (EDA) by creating a renewable
 18 16 chemical production tax credit, modifying the tax credit for
 18 17 investments in qualifying businesses and community=based seed
 18 18 capital funds, and modifying the entrepreneur investment awards
 18 19 program.
 18 20    DIVISION I ==== RENEWABLE CHEMICAL PRODUCTION TAX CREDIT.
 18 21   Division I creates a renewable chemical production tax credit
 18 22 program (program) that will be administered by the EDA and that
 18 23 will provide tax credits to eligible businesses that produce
 18 24 renewable chemicals in Iowa from biomass feedstock.  "Renewable
 18 25 chemical", "biomass feedstock", and other related terms are
 18 26 defined in the division.
 18 27    In order to qualify for the tax credit, a business must
 18 28 meet several requirements.  First, the business must be
 18 29 physically located in Iowa and operated for profit under
 18 30 single management.  Second, the business must not be an
 18 31 entity providing professional services, health care services,
 18 32 or medical treatments, or be engaged primarily in retail
 18 33 operations.  Third, the business must have organized, expanded,
 18 34 or located in Iowa on or after the effective date of the
 18 35 division.  Fourth, the business must not be, in the discretion
 19  1 of the EDA, ineligible under certain provisions relating to the
 19  2 relocation or reduction of business operations within Iowa.
 19  3 Fifth, the business must be in compliance with all agreements
 19  4 entered into under the program or other programs administered
 19  5 by the EDA.
 19  6    An eligible business seeking a tax credit is required
 19  7 to apply to the EDA during the calendar year following the
 19  8 calendar year in which the renewable chemicals are produced.
 19  9 The application must include the amount of renewable chemicals
 19 10 produced in Iowa from biomass feedstock by the eligible
 19 11 business during the calendar year, measured in pounds, and any
 19 12 other information reasonably required by the EDA in order to
 19 13 establish and verify eligibility under the program.  The EDA
 19 14 may accept applications on a continuous basis or may establish
 19 15 an annual application deadline.
 19 16    Before being issued a tax credit, an eligible business
 19 17 is required to enter into an agreement with the EDA for the
 19 18 successful completion of all requirements of the program.  The
 19 19 EDA is authorized to impose two compliance cost fees under the
 19 20 program.  The first fee equals $500 per agreement.  The second
 19 21 fee equals 0.5 percent of the value of the tax credit claimed
 19 22 pursuant to the agreement if the agreement has an aggregate tax
 19 23 credit value of $100,000 or greater.
 19 24    An eligible business that fails to comply with the
 19 25 requirements of the program or the terms of an agreement with
 19 26 the EDA may have its tax credits reduced, terminated, or
 19 27 rescinded, and may be subject to the repayment or recapture of
 19 28 claimed tax credits.
 19 29    Upon determining that all requirements of an agreement and
 19 30 the program have been fulfilled, the EDA shall issue a tax
 19 31 credit and related tax credit certificate to the eligible
 19 32 business in an amount equal to the product of $.05 multiplied
 19 33 by the number of pounds of renewable chemicals produced in Iowa
 19 34 from biomass feedstock by the eligible business during the
 19 35 calendar year.  Renewable chemicals produced by an eligible
 20  1 business prior to the effective date of the division, or
 20  2 prior to the date the business first qualifies as an eligible
 20  3 business, or after calendar year 2025, shall not qualify for
 20  4 the tax credit.
 20  5    The tax credit shall be claimed for the tax year during
 20  6 which the eligible business was issued the tax credit.  The tax
 20  7 credit may be claimed against the individual income tax and the
 20  8 corporate income tax.  The credit is refundable or may, at the
 20  9 election of the taxpayer, be carried forward for up to one tax
 20 10 year.   The tax credit shall not be transferred to any person.  A
 20 11 tax credit issued to a partnership, limited liability company,
 20 12 S corporation, cooperative organized under Code chapter 501
 20 13 and filing as a partnership for federal tax purposes, estate,
 20 14 or trust electing to have the income taxed directly to the
 20 15 individual may be claimed by the individual based upon the pro
 20 16 rata share of the individual's earnings from that entity.
 20 17    The division provides that the program is subject to the
 20 18 EDA's maximum aggregate tax credit cap of $170 million per
 20 19 fiscal year in Code section 15.119, and not more than $15
 20 20 million per fiscal year may be issued by the EDA under the
 20 21 program.  In addition, the maximum amount of tax credit that
 20 22 may be issued to an eligible business in any one calendar year
 20 23 shall not exceed $1 million or $500,000, depending on whether
 20 24 the eligible business has been operating in Iowa at the time of
 20 25 application for five or fewer years, or more than five years,
 20 26 respectively.  An eligible business shall not receive more than
 20 27 five tax credits under the program.  The EDA is required to
 20 28 issue tax credits on a first=come, first=served basis until the
 20 29 maximum amount of $15 million per fiscal year is reached.  If
 20 30 the amount of tax credits exceeds this amount in a fiscal year,
 20 31 the EDA is required to establish a wait list and give priority
 20 32 in subsequent years to the eligible businesses on the wait
 20 33 list.
 20 34    The division provides for the confidentiality of certain
 20 35 information under the program.  The identity of a tax credit
 21  1 recipient and the amount of the tax credit shall be considered
 21  2 public information under Code chapter 22 (examination of public
 21  3 records), but any other information or record in the possession
 21  4 of the EDA with respect to the program shall be presumed by
 21  5 the EDA to be a trade secret protected under Code chapter 550
 21  6 or common law and shall be kept confidential by the EDA unless
 21  7 otherwise ordered by a court.
 21  8    The division takes effect upon enactment and applies to
 21  9 renewable chemicals produced in Iowa from biomass feedstock on
 21 10 or after that date.  The division applies retroactively to tax
 21 11 years beginning on or after January 1, 2015.
 21 12    DIVISION II ==== ANGEL INVESTOR TAX CREDITS.   Division II
 21 13 makes several changes to the tax credit for investments in
 21 14 qualifying businesses and community=based seed capital funds,
 21 15 often referred to as the angel investor tax credits.  The
 21 16 division amends the purpose of the tax credit in Code section
 21 17 15E.41.  The division excludes investments in community=based
 21 18 seed capital funds from qualifying for the tax credit and
 21 19 makes several conforming amendments to remove references to
 21 20 community=based seed capital funds from the Code.
 21 21    The division modifies the amount and dollar limitation of
 21 22 the tax credit for a taxpayer.  The tax credit is increased
 21 23 from 20 percent to 25 percent of a taxpayer's equity investment
 21 24 in a qualifying business.  Under current law, a taxpayer cannot
 21 25 claim more than $50,000 of tax credit per investment in a
 21 26 qualifying business, and for each tax year a taxpayer and the
 21 27 taxpayer's affiliates cannot claim tax credits for more than
 21 28 five investments in five different qualifying businesses.  The
 21 29 division amends this dollar limitation to prohibit a natural
 21 30 person and the person's spouse, child, or sibling from claiming
 21 31 a combined amount of more than $100,000 in tax credits per tax
 21 32 year.
 21 33    The division also provides that no more than $500,000 in tax
 21 34 credits may be issued per tax year for equity investments in
 21 35 any one qualifying business.
 22  1 The division modifies the procedures for claiming the tax
 22  2 credit.  Under current law, the tax credit is not refundable
 22  3 but available for carryforward for up to five tax years.  The
 22  4 division makes the tax credit refundable for an investment
 22  5 made by a natural person, and for any other person reduces the
 22  6 carryforward period to three years.
 22  7    The division strikes a provision permitting the EDA
 22  8 to cooperate with small business development centers to
 22  9 disseminate information regarding the credits and to develop
 22 10 standard application forms, and requiring the EDA to distribute
 22 11 copies of the application forms to all community=based seed
 22 12 capital funds and potential individual investors.
 22 13    The division modifies the eligibility requirements for
 22 14 qualifying businesses.  The division strikes the requirement
 22 15 that a business have an owner that meets at least one of
 22 16 four qualifications relating to business education or
 22 17 business experience.  The division requires that a business
 22 18 be participating in an entrepreneurial assistance program,
 22 19 as defined in the division, but allows the EDA to waive this
 22 20 requirement if the business establishes that its owners,
 22 21 directors, officers, and employees have an appropriate level
 22 22 of experience such that an entrepreneurial assistance program
 22 23 would not materially change the prospects of the business.
 22 24 The EDA is allowed to consult with outside service providers
 22 25 in considering such a waiver.  The division increases from $5
 22 26 million to $10 million the maximum amount of net worth that
 22 27 a business may have to be considered a qualifying business.
 22 28 The division increases from $250,000 to $500,000 the amount of
 22 29 financing that a business must have in order to be considered a
 22 30 qualifying business, removes "near equity" from the types of
 22 31 financing that will be considered in that calculation, requires
 22 32 that the financing be secured at the time of application for
 22 33 the tax credits, and requires that the business have at least
 22 34 two investors at the time of application for the tax credits.
 22 35 These modified eligibility requirements apply to businesses
 23  1 that submit an application to the EDA to be registered as a
 23  2 qualifying business on or after the effective date of this
 23  3 division of the bill, and businesses that submitted such an
 23  4 application to the EDA before the effective date of this
 23  5 division of the bill shall be governed by current law.
 23  6    The division provides for the confidentiality of certain
 23  7 information with regard to the tax credit.  The identity of
 23  8 a qualifying business, the identity of an investor and the
 23  9 qualifying business in which the investor made an equity
 23 10 investment, and the total number and amount of tax credits
 23 11 issued shall be considered public information under Code
 23 12 chapter 22 (examination of public records), but any other
 23 13 information or record in the possession of the EDA with respect
 23 14 to the program shall be presumed by the EDA to be a trade secret
 23 15 protected under Code chapter 550 or common law and shall be
 23 16 kept confidential by the EDA unless otherwise ordered by a
 23 17 court.
 23 18    The division takes effect upon enactment and applies to
 23 19 equity investments in a qualifying business made on or after
 23 20 that date.  Equity investments in a qualifying business or
 23 21 community=based seed capital fund made prior to the effective
 23 22 date of the division shall be governed by current law.
 23 23    DIVISION III ==== ENTREPRENEUR INVESTMENT AWARDS PROGRAM.
 23 24  Division III amends the entrepreneur investment awards program
 23 25 administered by the EDA.  The division strikes provisions that
 23 26 prohibited the EDA from making awards under the program since
 23 27 July 1, 2014, and that required the EDA by December 31, 2014,
 23 28 to conduct a comprehensive review of the program and submit
 23 29 a report with specified information to the governor and the
 23 30 general assembly.
 23 31    The division modifies the purpose of the program to be
 23 32 to provide financial assistance to eligible entrepreneurial
 23 33 assistance providers (provider) that provide technical and
 23 34 financial assistance to entrepreneurs and start=up companies
 23 35 seeking to create, locate, or expand a business in Iowa.
 24  1 "Financial assistance" is defined in the division.
 24  2    The division changes the requirements for receiving an
 24  3 award.  To be eligible to receive an award under current
 24  4 law, an entrepreneurial assistance program must have been
 24  5 an Iowa=based business, expended at least $500,000 during
 24  6 the previous fiscal year to provide technical and financial
 24  7 assistance services that meet the broad=based needs of
 24  8 entrepreneurs seeking to create, locate, or expand a business
 24  9 in Iowa that intends to derive more than 10 percent of its
 24 10 gross sales from markets outside Iowa; and must have engaged
 24 11 and communicated with certain other programs, funding sources,
 24 12 and entities for its entrepreneur clients.  The division
 24 13 amends the eligibility for receiving financial assistance to
 24 14 require that a provider have its principal place of operations
 24 15 in Iowa and that the provider offer a comprehensive set of
 24 16 business development services to emerging and early=stage
 24 17 innovation companies to assist in the creation, location,
 24 18 growth, and long=term success of the company in Iowa.
 24 19 "Business development services" is defined in the division.
 24 20 Business development services may be performed at the physical
 24 21 location of the provider or the company and may be provided in
 24 22 consideration of equity participation in the company, a fee for
 24 23 services, or a membership agreement with the company.
 24 24    Under current law, the EDA board could approve, deny, or
 24 25 defer each application for a grant, and was required to award
 24 26 grants on a first=come, first=served basis.  The division
 24 27 specifies that the EDA board has the discretion to approve,
 24 28 deny, or defer each application for financial assistance and
 24 29 that the amount of financial assistance awarded to a provider
 24 30 is within the discretion of the EDA.  The division requires
 24 31 the EDA to award financial assistance on a competitive basis
 24 32 and allows the EDA to develop scoring criteria and establish
 24 33 minimum requirements for the receipt of a financial assistance
 24 34 award.
 24 35    In addition to the four factors relating to the provider's
 25  1 professional staff that the EDA may consider under current
 25  2 law in deciding whether to award financial assistance, the
 25  3 division provides that the EDA may also consider the service
 25  4 model and likelihood of success of the provider, the provider's
 25  5 similarity to other successful providers in the country, and
 25  6 the provider's financial need.
 25  7    The division modifies the maximum award amount for a
 25  8 recipient.  Under current law, a grant to an entrepreneur
 25  9 assistance program cannot exceed the lesser of 25 percent of
 25 10 the funds expended by the program during the previous fiscal
 25 11 year, 100 percent of the funds raised from certain persons
 25 12 by the program during the previous fiscal year, or $200,000.
 25 13 The division provides that the amount of financial assistance
 25 14 awarded to any one provider shall not exceed $200,000.
 25 15    The division modifies the permitted use of funds received
 25 16 under the program.  Under current law, grants are only
 25 17 permitted to be used for the purpose of operating costs
 25 18 incurred by the program.  The division specifies that financial
 25 19 assistance awarded to a provider shall only be used for
 25 20 the purpose of operating costs incurred by the provider in
 25 21 the provision of business development services to emerging
 25 22 and early=stage innovation companies in Iowa.  The division
 25 23 further requires that such financial assistance shall not be
 25 24 distributed to owners or investors of the company to which the
 25 25 business development services are being provided and shall not
 25 26 be provided to other persons assisting with the provision of
 25 27 the services.
 25 28    Under current law, an entrepreneurial assistance provider is
 25 29 required to accept client referrals from the EDA as a condition
 25 30 of receiving a grant.  The division provides that the EDA may
 25 31 make client referrals to eligible providers.
 25 32    DIVISION IV ==== MISCELLANEOUS CHANGES.  Division IV makes
 25 33 several miscellaneous changes to other EDA programs.  The
 25 34 division amends the sales and use tax refund available under
 25 35 the workforce housing tax incentive program.  That refund
 26  1 is available for sales and use tax paid prior to project
 26  2 completion, which is currently defined to mean the first date
 26  3 upon which the average annualized production of finished
 26  4 product for the preceding 90=day period at the manufacturing
 26  5 facility operated by the eligible business is at least 50
 26  6 percent of the initial design capacity of the facility.  The
 26  7 division amends the definition of "project completion" to mean
 26  8 the date on which the EDA notifies the department of revenue
 26  9 that all applicable requirements of a workforce housing tax
 26 10 incentive program agreement are satisfied.  This provision
 26 11 takes effect upon enactment and applies retroactively to July
 26 12 1, 2014, for all workforce housing tax incentive agreements
 26 13 entered into on or after that date.
 26 14    The division allows the EDA to extend the project
 26 15 completion date for a project awarded tax incentives under the
 26 16 redevelopment tax credit program and the housing enterprise
 26 17 zone tax incentives program if the property that is the subject
 26 18 of the project suffered a catastrophic fire during the 2014
 26 19 calendar year.

 18  4    Sec. 38.  EFFECTIVE UPON ENACTMENT.  The section of this
 18  5 division of this Act amending section 15.355, being deemed of
 18  6 immediate importance, takes effect upon enactment.
 18  7    Sec. 39.  RETROACTIVE APPLICABILITY.  The section of
 18  8 this division of this Act amending section 15.355 applies
 18  9 retroactively to July 1, 2014, for all agreements entered into
 18 10 pursuant to section 15.354 on or after that date.
 18 11                           EXPLANATION
 18 12 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
 18 13 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
 18 14    This bill relates to the administration of programs by the
 18 15 economic development authority (EDA) by creating a renewable
 18 16 chemical production tax credit, modifying the tax credit for
 18 17 investments in qualifying businesses and community=based seed
 18 18 capital funds, and modifying the entrepreneur investment awards
 18 19 program.
 18 20    DIVISION I ==== RENEWABLE CHEMICAL PRODUCTION TAX CREDIT.
 18 21   Division I creates a renewable chemical production tax credit
 18 22 program (program) that will be administered by the EDA and that
 18 23 will provide tax credits to eligible businesses that produce
 18 24 renewable chemicals in Iowa from biomass feedstock.  "Renewable
 18 25 chemical", "biomass feedstock", and other related terms are
 18 26 defined in the division.
 18 27    In order to qualify for the tax credit, a business must
 18 28 meet several requirements.  First, the business must be
 18 29 physically located in Iowa and operated for profit under
 18 30 single management.  Second, the business must not be an
 18 31 entity providing professional services, health care services,
 18 32 or medical treatments, or be engaged primarily in retail
 18 33 operations.  Third, the business must have organized, expanded,
 18 34 or located in Iowa on or after the effective date of the
 18 35 division.  Fourth, the business must not be, in the discretion
 19  1 of the EDA, ineligible under certain provisions relating to the
 19  2 relocation or reduction of business operations within Iowa.
 19  3 Fifth, the business must be in compliance with all agreements
 19  4 entered into under the program or other programs administered
 19  5 by the EDA.
 19  6    An eligible business seeking a tax credit is required
 19  7 to apply to the EDA during the calendar year following the
 19  8 calendar year in which the renewable chemicals are produced.
 19  9 The application must include the amount of renewable chemicals
 19 10 produced in Iowa from biomass feedstock by the eligible
 19 11 business during the calendar year, measured in pounds, and any
 19 12 other information reasonably required by the EDA in order to
 19 13 establish and verify eligibility under the program.  The EDA
 19 14 may accept applications on a continuous basis or may establish
 19 15 an annual application deadline.
 19 16    Before being issued a tax credit, an eligible business
 19 17 is required to enter into an agreement with the EDA for the
 19 18 successful completion of all requirements of the program.  The
 19 19 EDA is authorized to impose two compliance cost fees under the
 19 20 program.  The first fee equals $500 per agreement.  The second
 19 21 fee equals 0.5 percent of the value of the tax credit claimed
 19 22 pursuant to the agreement if the agreement has an aggregate tax
 19 23 credit value of $100,000 or greater.
 19 24    An eligible business that fails to comply with the
 19 25 requirements of the program or the terms of an agreement with
 19 26 the EDA may have its tax credits reduced, terminated, or
 19 27 rescinded, and may be subject to the repayment or recapture of
 19 28 claimed tax credits.
 19 29    Upon determining that all requirements of an agreement and
 19 30 the program have been fulfilled, the EDA shall issue a tax
 19 31 credit and related tax credit certificate to the eligible
 19 32 business in an amount equal to the product of $.05 multiplied
 19 33 by the number of pounds of renewable chemicals produced in Iowa
 19 34 from biomass feedstock by the eligible business during the
 19 35 calendar year.  Renewable chemicals produced by an eligible
 20  1 business prior to the effective date of the division, or
 20  2 prior to the date the business first qualifies as an eligible
 20  3 business, or after calendar year 2025, shall not qualify for
 20  4 the tax credit.
 20  5    The tax credit shall be claimed for the tax year during
 20  6 which the eligible business was issued the tax credit.  The tax
 20  7 credit may be claimed against the individual income tax and the
 20  8 corporate income tax.  The credit is refundable or may, at the
 20  9 election of the taxpayer, be carried forward for up to one tax
 20 10 year.   The tax credit shall not be transferred to any person.  A
 20 11 tax credit issued to a partnership, limited liability company,
 20 12 S corporation, cooperative organized under Code chapter 501
 20 13 and filing as a partnership for federal tax purposes, estate,
 20 14 or trust electing to have the income taxed directly to the
 20 15 individual may be claimed by the individual based upon the pro
 20 16 rata share of the individual's earnings from that entity.
 20 17    The division provides that the program is subject to the
 20 18 EDA's maximum aggregate tax credit cap of $170 million per
 20 19 fiscal year in Code section 15.119, and not more than $15
 20 20 million per fiscal year may be issued by the EDA under the
 20 21 program.  In addition, the maximum amount of tax credit that
 20 22 may be issued to an eligible business in any one calendar year
 20 23 shall not exceed $1 million or $500,000, depending on whether
 20 24 the eligible business has been operating in Iowa at the time of
 20 25 application for five or fewer years, or more than five years,
 20 26 respectively.  An eligible business shall not receive more than
 20 27 five tax credits under the program.  The EDA is required to
 20 28 issue tax credits on a first=come, first=served basis until the
 20 29 maximum amount of $15 million per fiscal year is reached.  If
 20 30 the amount of tax credits exceeds this amount in a fiscal year,
 20 31 the EDA is required to establish a wait list and give priority
 20 32 in subsequent years to the eligible businesses on the wait
 20 33 list.
 20 34    The division provides for the confidentiality of certain
 20 35 information under the program.  The identity of a tax credit
 21  1 recipient and the amount of the tax credit shall be considered
 21  2 public information under Code chapter 22 (examination of public
 21  3 records), but any other information or record in the possession
 21  4 of the EDA with respect to the program shall be presumed by
 21  5 the EDA to be a trade secret protected under Code chapter 550
 21  6 or common law and shall be kept confidential by the EDA unless
 21  7 otherwise ordered by a court.
 21  8    The division takes effect upon enactment and applies to
 21  9 renewable chemicals produced in Iowa from biomass feedstock on
 21 10 or after that date.  The division applies retroactively to tax
 21 11 years beginning on or after January 1, 2015.
 21 12    DIVISION II ==== ANGEL INVESTOR TAX CREDITS.   Division II
 21 13 makes several changes to the tax credit for investments in
 21 14 qualifying businesses and community=based seed capital funds,
 21 15 often referred to as the angel investor tax credits.  The
 21 16 division amends the purpose of the tax credit in Code section
 21 17 15E.41.  The division excludes investments in community=based
 21 18 seed capital funds from qualifying for the tax credit and
 21 19 makes several conforming amendments to remove references to
 21 20 community=based seed capital funds from the Code.
 21 21    The division modifies the amount and dollar limitation of
 21 22 the tax credit for a taxpayer.  The tax credit is increased
 21 23 from 20 percent to 25 percent of a taxpayer's equity investment
 21 24 in a qualifying business.  Under current law, a taxpayer cannot
 21 25 claim more than $50,000 of tax credit per investment in a
 21 26 qualifying business, and for each tax year a taxpayer and the
 21 27 taxpayer's affiliates cannot claim tax credits for more than
 21 28 five investments in five different qualifying businesses.  The
 21 29 division amends this dollar limitation to prohibit a natural
 21 30 person and the person's spouse, child, or sibling from claiming
 21 31 a combined amount of more than $100,000 in tax credits per tax
 21 32 year.
 21 33    The division also provides that no more than $500,000 in tax
 21 34 credits may be issued per tax year for equity investments in
 21 35 any one qualifying business.
 22  1 The division modifies the procedures for claiming the tax
 22  2 credit.  Under current law, the tax credit is not refundable
 22  3 but available for carryforward for up to five tax years.  The
 22  4 division makes the tax credit refundable for an investment
 22  5 made by a natural person, and for any other person reduces the
 22  6 carryforward period to three years.
 22  7    The division strikes a provision permitting the EDA
 22  8 to cooperate with small business development centers to
 22  9 disseminate information regarding the credits and to develop
 22 10 standard application forms, and requiring the EDA to distribute
 22 11 copies of the application forms to all community=based seed
 22 12 capital funds and potential individual investors.
 22 13    The division modifies the eligibility requirements for
 22 14 qualifying businesses.  The division strikes the requirement
 22 15 that a business have an owner that meets at least one of
 22 16 four qualifications relating to business education or
 22 17 business experience.  The division requires that a business
 22 18 be participating in an entrepreneurial assistance program,
 22 19 as defined in the division, but allows the EDA to waive this
 22 20 requirement if the business establishes that its owners,
 22 21 directors, officers, and employees have an appropriate level
 22 22 of experience such that an entrepreneurial assistance program
 22 23 would not materially change the prospects of the business.
 22 24 The EDA is allowed to consult with outside service providers
 22 25 in considering such a waiver.  The division increases from $5
 22 26 million to $10 million the maximum amount of net worth that
 22 27 a business may have to be considered a qualifying business.
 22 28 The division increases from $250,000 to $500,000 the amount of
 22 29 financing that a business must have in order to be considered a
 22 30 qualifying business, removes "near equity" from the types of
 22 31 financing that will be considered in that calculation, requires
 22 32 that the financing be secured at the time of application for
 22 33 the tax credits, and requires that the business have at least
 22 34 two investors at the time of application for the tax credits.
 22 35 These modified eligibility requirements apply to businesses
 23  1 that submit an application to the EDA to be registered as a
 23  2 qualifying business on or after the effective date of this
 23  3 division of the bill, and businesses that submitted such an
 23  4 application to the EDA before the effective date of this
 23  5 division of the bill shall be governed by current law.
 23  6    The division provides for the confidentiality of certain
 23  7 information with regard to the tax credit.  The identity of
 23  8 a qualifying business, the identity of an investor and the
 23  9 qualifying business in which the investor made an equity
 23 10 investment, and the total number and amount of tax credits
 23 11 issued shall be considered public information under Code
 23 12 chapter 22 (examination of public records), but any other
 23 13 information or record in the possession of the EDA with respect
 23 14 to the program shall be presumed by the EDA to be a trade secret
 23 15 protected under Code chapter 550 or common law and shall be
 23 16 kept confidential by the EDA unless otherwise ordered by a
 23 17 court.
 23 18    The division takes effect upon enactment and applies to
 23 19 equity investments in a qualifying business made on or after
 23 20 that date.  Equity investments in a qualifying business or
 23 21 community=based seed capital fund made prior to the effective
 23 22 date of the division shall be governed by current law.
 23 23    DIVISION III ==== ENTREPRENEUR INVESTMENT AWARDS PROGRAM.
 23 24  Division III amends the entrepreneur investment awards program
 23 25 administered by the EDA.  The division strikes provisions that
 23 26 prohibited the EDA from making awards under the program since
 23 27 July 1, 2014, and that required the EDA by December 31, 2014,
 23 28 to conduct a comprehensive review of the program and submit
 23 29 a report with specified information to the governor and the
 23 30 general assembly.
 23 31    The division modifies the purpose of the program to be
 23 32 to provide financial assistance to eligible entrepreneurial
 23 33 assistance providers (provider) that provide technical and
 23 34 financial assistance to entrepreneurs and start=up companies
 23 35 seeking to create, locate, or expand a business in Iowa.
 24  1 "Financial assistance" is defined in the division.
 24  2    The division changes the requirements for receiving an
 24  3 award.  To be eligible to receive an award under current
 24  4 law, an entrepreneurial assistance program must have been
 24  5 an Iowa=based business, expended at least $500,000 during
 24  6 the previous fiscal year to provide technical and financial
 24  7 assistance services that meet the broad=based needs of
 24  8 entrepreneurs seeking to create, locate, or expand a business
 24  9 in Iowa that intends to derive more than 10 percent of its
 24 10 gross sales from markets outside Iowa; and must have engaged
 24 11 and communicated with certain other programs, funding sources,
 24 12 and entities for its entrepreneur clients.  The division
 24 13 amends the eligibility for receiving financial assistance to
 24 14 require that a provider have its principal place of operations
 24 15 in Iowa and that the provider offer a comprehensive set of
 24 16 business development services to emerging and early=stage
 24 17 innovation companies to assist in the creation, location,
 24 18 growth, and long=term success of the company in Iowa.
 24 19 "Business development services" is defined in the division.
 24 20 Business development services may be performed at the physical
 24 21 location of the provider or the company and may be provided in
 24 22 consideration of equity participation in the company, a fee for
 24 23 services, or a membership agreement with the company.
 24 24    Under current law, the EDA board could approve, deny, or
 24 25 defer each application for a grant, and was required to award
 24 26 grants on a first=come, first=served basis.  The division
 24 27 specifies that the EDA board has the discretion to approve,
 24 28 deny, or defer each application for financial assistance and
 24 29 that the amount of financial assistance awarded to a provider
 24 30 is within the discretion of the EDA.  The division requires
 24 31 the EDA to award financial assistance on a competitive basis
 24 32 and allows the EDA to develop scoring criteria and establish
 24 33 minimum requirements for the receipt of a financial assistance
 24 34 award.
 24 35    In addition to the four factors relating to the provider's
 25  1 professional staff that the EDA may consider under current
 25  2 law in deciding whether to award financial assistance, the
 25  3 division provides that the EDA may also consider the service
 25  4 model and likelihood of success of the provider, the provider's
 25  5 similarity to other successful providers in the country, and
 25  6 the provider's financial need.
 25  7    The division modifies the maximum award amount for a
 25  8 recipient.  Under current law, a grant to an entrepreneur
 25  9 assistance program cannot exceed the lesser of 25 percent of
 25 10 the funds expended by the program during the previous fiscal
 25 11 year, 100 percent of the funds raised from certain persons
 25 12 by the program during the previous fiscal year, or $200,000.
 25 13 The division provides that the amount of financial assistance
 25 14 awarded to any one provider shall not exceed $200,000.
 25 15    The division modifies the permitted use of funds received
 25 16 under the program.  Under current law, grants are only
 25 17 permitted to be used for the purpose of operating costs
 25 18 incurred by the program.  The division specifies that financial
 25 19 assistance awarded to a provider shall only be used for
 25 20 the purpose of operating costs incurred by the provider in
 25 21 the provision of business development services to emerging
 25 22 and early=stage innovation companies in Iowa.  The division
 25 23 further requires that such financial assistance shall not be
 25 24 distributed to owners or investors of the company to which the
 25 25 business development services are being provided and shall not
 25 26 be provided to other persons assisting with the provision of
 25 27 the services.
 25 28    Under current law, an entrepreneurial assistance provider is
 25 29 required to accept client referrals from the EDA as a condition
 25 30 of receiving a grant.  The division provides that the EDA may
 25 31 make client referrals to eligible providers.
 25 32    DIVISION IV ==== MISCELLANEOUS CHANGES.  Division IV makes
 25 33 several miscellaneous changes to other EDA programs.  The
 25 34 division amends the sales and use tax refund available under
 25 35 the workforce housing tax incentive program.  That refund
 26  1 is available for sales and use tax paid prior to project
 26  2 completion, which is currently defined to mean the first date
 26  3 upon which the average annualized production of finished
 26  4 product for the preceding 90=day period at the manufacturing
 26  5 facility operated by the eligible business is at least 50
 26  6 percent of the initial design capacity of the facility.  The
 26  7 division amends the definition of "project completion" to mean
 26  8 the date on which the EDA notifies the department of revenue
 26  9 that all applicable requirements of a workforce housing tax
 26 10 incentive program agreement are satisfied.  This provision
 26 11 takes effect upon enactment and applies retroactively to July
 26 12 1, 2014, for all workforce housing tax incentive agreements
 26 13 entered into on or after that date.
 26 14    The division allows the EDA to extend the project
 26 15 completion date for a project awarded tax incentives under the
 26 16 redevelopment tax credit program and the housing enterprise
 26 17 zone tax incentives program if the property that is the subject
 26 18 of the project suffered a catastrophic fire during the 2014
 26 19 calendar year.

 18  4    Sec. 38.  EFFECTIVE UPON ENACTMENT.  The section of this
 18  5 division of this Act amending section 15.355, being deemed of
 18  6 immediate importance, takes effect upon enactment.
 18  7    Sec. 39.  RETROACTIVE APPLICABILITY.  The section of
 18  8 this division of this Act amending section 15.355 applies
 18  9 retroactively to July 1, 2014, for all agreements entered into
 18 10 pursuant to section 15.354 on or after that date.
 18 11                           EXPLANATION
 18 12 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
 18 13 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
 18 14    This bill relates to the administration of programs by the
 18 15 economic development authority (EDA) by creating a renewable
 18 16 chemical production tax credit, modifying the tax credit for
 18 17 investments in qualifying businesses and community=based seed
 18 18 capital funds, and modifying the entrepreneur investment awards
 18 19 program.
 18 20    DIVISION I ==== RENEWABLE CHEMICAL PRODUCTION TAX CREDIT.
 18 21   Division I creates a renewable chemical production tax credit
 18 22 program (program) that will be administered by the EDA and that
 18 23 will provide tax credits to eligible businesses that produce
 18 24 renewable chemicals in Iowa from biomass feedstock.  "Renewable
 18 25 chemical", "biomass feedstock", and other related terms are
 18 26 defined in the division.
 18 27    In order to qualify for the tax credit, a business must
 18 28 meet several requirements.  First, the business must be
 18 29 physically located in Iowa and operated for profit under
 18 30 single management.  Second, the business must not be an
 18 31 entity providing professional services, health care services,
 18 32 or medical treatments, or be engaged primarily in retail
 18 33 operations.  Third, the business must have organized, expanded,
 18 34 or located in Iowa on or after the effective date of the
 18 35 division.  Fourth, the business must not be, in the discretion
 19  1 of the EDA, ineligible under certain provisions relating to the
 19  2 relocation or reduction of business operations within Iowa.
 19  3 Fifth, the business must be in compliance with all agreements
 19  4 entered into under the program or other programs administered
 19  5 by the EDA.
 19  6    An eligible business seeking a tax credit is required
 19  7 to apply to the EDA during the calendar year following the
 19  8 calendar year in which the renewable chemicals are produced.
 19  9 The application must include the amount of renewable chemicals
 19 10 produced in Iowa from biomass feedstock by the eligible
 19 11 business during the calendar year, measured in pounds, and any
 19 12 other information reasonably required by the EDA in order to
 19 13 establish and verify eligibility under the program.  The EDA
 19 14 may accept applications on a continuous basis or may establish
 19 15 an annual application deadline.
 19 16    Before being issued a tax credit, an eligible business
 19 17 is required to enter into an agreement with the EDA for the
 19 18 successful completion of all requirements of the program.  The
 19 19 EDA is authorized to impose two compliance cost fees under the
 19 20 program.  The first fee equals $500 per agreement.  The second
 19 21 fee equals 0.5 percent of the value of the tax credit claimed
 19 22 pursuant to the agreement if the agreement has an aggregate tax
 19 23 credit value of $100,000 or greater.
 19 24    An eligible business that fails to comply with the
 19 25 requirements of the program or the terms of an agreement with
 19 26 the EDA may have its tax credits reduced, terminated, or
 19 27 rescinded, and may be subject to the repayment or recapture of
 19 28 claimed tax credits.
 19 29    Upon determining that all requirements of an agreement and
 19 30 the program have been fulfilled, the EDA shall issue a tax
 19 31 credit and related tax credit certificate to the eligible
 19 32 business in an amount equal to the product of $.05 multiplied
 19 33 by the number of pounds of renewable chemicals produced in Iowa
 19 34 from biomass feedstock by the eligible business during the
 19 35 calendar year.  Renewable chemicals produced by an eligible
 20  1 business prior to the effective date of the division, or
 20  2 prior to the date the business first qualifies as an eligible
 20  3 business, or after calendar year 2025, shall not qualify for
 20  4 the tax credit.
 20  5    The tax credit shall be claimed for the tax year during
 20  6 which the eligible business was issued the tax credit.  The tax
 20  7 credit may be claimed against the individual income tax and the
 20  8 corporate income tax.  The credit is refundable or may, at the
 20  9 election of the taxpayer, be carried forward for up to one tax
 20 10 year.   The tax credit shall not be transferred to any person.  A
 20 11 tax credit issued to a partnership, limited liability company,
 20 12 S corporation, cooperative organized under Code chapter 501
 20 13 and filing as a partnership for federal tax purposes, estate,
 20 14 or trust electing to have the income taxed directly to the
 20 15 individual may be claimed by the individual based upon the pro
 20 16 rata share of the individual's earnings from that entity.
 20 17    The division provides that the program is subject to the
 20 18 EDA's maximum aggregate tax credit cap of $170 million per
 20 19 fiscal year in Code section 15.119, and not more than $15
 20 20 million per fiscal year may be issued by the EDA under the
 20 21 program.  In addition, the maximum amount of tax credit that
 20 22 may be issued to an eligible business in any one calendar year
 20 23 shall not exceed $1 million or $500,000, depending on whether
 20 24 the eligible business has been operating in Iowa at the time of
 20 25 application for five or fewer years, or more than five years,
 20 26 respectively.  An eligible business shall not receive more than
 20 27 five tax credits under the program.  The EDA is required to
 20 28 issue tax credits on a first=come, first=served basis until the
 20 29 maximum amount of $15 million per fiscal year is reached.  If
 20 30 the amount of tax credits exceeds this amount in a fiscal year,
 20 31 the EDA is required to establish a wait list and give priority
 20 32 in subsequent years to the eligible businesses on the wait
 20 33 list.
 20 34    The division provides for the confidentiality of certain
 20 35 information under the program.  The identity of a tax credit
 21  1 recipient and the amount of the tax credit shall be considered
 21  2 public information under Code chapter 22 (examination of public
 21  3 records), but any other information or record in the possession
 21  4 of the EDA with respect to the program shall be presumed by
 21  5 the EDA to be a trade secret protected under Code chapter 550
 21  6 or common law and shall be kept confidential by the EDA unless
 21  7 otherwise ordered by a court.
 21  8    The division takes effect upon enactment and applies to
 21  9 renewable chemicals produced in Iowa from biomass feedstock on
 21 10 or after that date.  The division applies retroactively to tax
 21 11 years beginning on or after January 1, 2015.
 21 12    DIVISION II ==== ANGEL INVESTOR TAX CREDITS.   Division II
 21 13 makes several changes to the tax credit for investments in
 21 14 qualifying businesses and community=based seed capital funds,
 21 15 often referred to as the angel investor tax credits.  The
 21 16 division amends the purpose of the tax credit in Code section
 21 17 15E.41.  The division excludes investments in community=based
 21 18 seed capital funds from qualifying for the tax credit and
 21 19 makes several conforming amendments to remove references to
 21 20 community=based seed capital funds from the Code.
 21 21    The division modifies the amount and dollar limitation of
 21 22 the tax credit for a taxpayer.  The tax credit is increased
 21 23 from 20 percent to 25 percent of a taxpayer's equity investment
 21 24 in a qualifying business.  Under current law, a taxpayer cannot
 21 25 claim more than $50,000 of tax credit per investment in a
 21 26 qualifying business, and for each tax year a taxpayer and the
 21 27 taxpayer's affiliates cannot claim tax credits for more than
 21 28 five investments in five different qualifying businesses.  The
 21 29 division amends this dollar limitation to prohibit a natural
 21 30 person and the person's spouse, child, or sibling from claiming
 21 31 a combined amount of more than $100,000 in tax credits per tax
 21 32 year.
 21 33    The division also provides that no more than $500,000 in tax
 21 34 credits may be issued per tax year for equity investments in
 21 35 any one qualifying business.
 22  1 The division modifies the procedures for claiming the tax
 22  2 credit.  Under current law, the tax credit is not refundable
 22  3 but available for carryforward for up to five tax years.  The
 22  4 division makes the tax credit refundable for an investment
 22  5 made by a natural person, and for any other person reduces the
 22  6 carryforward period to three years.
 22  7    The division strikes a provision permitting the EDA
 22  8 to cooperate with small business development centers to
 22  9 disseminate information regarding the credits and to develop
 22 10 standard application forms, and requiring the EDA to distribute
 22 11 copies of the application forms to all community=based seed
 22 12 capital funds and potential individual investors.
 22 13    The division modifies the eligibility requirements for
 22 14 qualifying businesses.  The division strikes the requirement
 22 15 that a business have an owner that meets at least one of
 22 16 four qualifications relating to business education or
 22 17 business experience.  The division requires that a business
 22 18 be participating in an entrepreneurial assistance program,
 22 19 as defined in the division, but allows the EDA to waive this
 22 20 requirement if the business establishes that its owners,
 22 21 directors, officers, and employees have an appropriate level
 22 22 of experience such that an entrepreneurial assistance program
 22 23 would not materially change the prospects of the business.
 22 24 The EDA is allowed to consult with outside service providers
 22 25 in considering such a waiver.  The division increases from $5
 22 26 million to $10 million the maximum amount of net worth that
 22 27 a business may have to be considered a qualifying business.
 22 28 The division increases from $250,000 to $500,000 the amount of
 22 29 financing that a business must have in order to be considered a
 22 30 qualifying business, removes "near equity" from the types of
 22 31 financing that will be considered in that calculation, requires
 22 32 that the financing be secured at the time of application for
 22 33 the tax credits, and requires that the business have at least
 22 34 two investors at the time of application for the tax credits.
 22 35 These modified eligibility requirements apply to businesses
 23  1 that submit an application to the EDA to be registered as a
 23  2 qualifying business on or after the effective date of this
 23  3 division of the bill, and businesses that submitted such an
 23  4 application to the EDA before the effective date of this
 23  5 division of the bill shall be governed by current law.
 23  6    The division provides for the confidentiality of certain
 23  7 information with regard to the tax credit.  The identity of
 23  8 a qualifying business, the identity of an investor and the
 23  9 qualifying business in which the investor made an equity
 23 10 investment, and the total number and amount of tax credits
 23 11 issued shall be considered public information under Code
 23 12 chapter 22 (examination of public records), but any other
 23 13 information or record in the possession of the EDA with respect
 23 14 to the program shall be presumed by the EDA to be a trade secret
 23 15 protected under Code chapter 550 or common law and shall be
 23 16 kept confidential by the EDA unless otherwise ordered by a
 23 17 court.
 23 18    The division takes effect upon enactment and applies to
 23 19 equity investments in a qualifying business made on or after
 23 20 that date.  Equity investments in a qualifying business or
 23 21 community=based seed capital fund made prior to the effective
 23 22 date of the division shall be governed by current law.
 23 23    DIVISION III ==== ENTREPRENEUR INVESTMENT AWARDS PROGRAM.
 23 24  Division III amends the entrepreneur investment awards program
 23 25 administered by the EDA.  The division strikes provisions that
 23 26 prohibited the EDA from making awards under the program since
 23 27 July 1, 2014, and that required the EDA by December 31, 2014,
 23 28 to conduct a comprehensive review of the program and submit
 23 29 a report with specified information to the governor and the
 23 30 general assembly.
 23 31    The division modifies the purpose of the program to be
 23 32 to provide financial assistance to eligible entrepreneurial
 23 33 assistance providers (provider) that provide technical and
 23 34 financial assistance to entrepreneurs and start=up companies
 23 35 seeking to create, locate, or expand a business in Iowa.
 24  1 "Financial assistance" is defined in the division.
 24  2    The division changes the requirements for receiving an
 24  3 award.  To be eligible to receive an award under current
 24  4 law, an entrepreneurial assistance program must have been
 24  5 an Iowa=based business, expended at least $500,000 during
 24  6 the previous fiscal year to provide technical and financial
 24  7 assistance services that meet the broad=based needs of
 24  8 entrepreneurs seeking to create, locate, or expand a business
 24  9 in Iowa that intends to derive more than 10 percent of its
 24 10 gross sales from markets outside Iowa; and must have engaged
 24 11 and communicated with certain other programs, funding sources,
 24 12 and entities for its entrepreneur clients.  The division
 24 13 amends the eligibility for receiving financial assistance to
 24 14 require that a provider have its principal place of operations
 24 15 in Iowa and that the provider offer a comprehensive set of
 24 16 business development services to emerging and early=stage
 24 17 innovation companies to assist in the creation, location,
 24 18 growth, and long=term success of the company in Iowa.
 24 19 "Business development services" is defined in the division.
 24 20 Business development services may be performed at the physical
 24 21 location of the provider or the company and may be provided in
 24 22 consideration of equity participation in the company, a fee for
 24 23 services, or a membership agreement with the company.
 24 24    Under current law, the EDA board could approve, deny, or
 24 25 defer each application for a grant, and was required to award
 24 26 grants on a first=come, first=served basis.  The division
 24 27 specifies that the EDA board has the discretion to approve,
 24 28 deny, or defer each application for financial assistance and
 24 29 that the amount of financial assistance awarded to a provider
 24 30 is within the discretion of the EDA.  The division requires
 24 31 the EDA to award financial assistance on a competitive basis
 24 32 and allows the EDA to develop scoring criteria and establish
 24 33 minimum requirements for the receipt of a financial assistance
 24 34 award.
 24 35    In addition to the four factors relating to the provider's
 25  1 professional staff that the EDA may consider under current
 25  2 law in deciding whether to award financial assistance, the
 25  3 division provides that the EDA may also consider the service
 25  4 model and likelihood of success of the provider, the provider's
 25  5 similarity to other successful providers in the country, and
 25  6 the provider's financial need.
 25  7    The division modifies the maximum award amount for a
 25  8 recipient.  Under current law, a grant to an entrepreneur
 25  9 assistance program cannot exceed the lesser of 25 percent of
 25 10 the funds expended by the program during the previous fiscal
 25 11 year, 100 percent of the funds raised from certain persons
 25 12 by the program during the previous fiscal year, or $200,000.
 25 13 The division provides that the amount of financial assistance
 25 14 awarded to any one provider shall not exceed $200,000.
 25 15    The division modifies the permitted use of funds received
 25 16 under the program.  Under current law, grants are only
 25 17 permitted to be used for the purpose of operating costs
 25 18 incurred by the program.  The division specifies that financial
 25 19 assistance awarded to a provider shall only be used for
 25 20 the purpose of operating costs incurred by the provider in
 25 21 the provision of business development services to emerging
 25 22 and early=stage innovation companies in Iowa.  The division
 25 23 further requires that such financial assistance shall not be
 25 24 distributed to owners or investors of the company to which the
 25 25 business development services are being provided and shall not
 25 26 be provided to other persons assisting with the provision of
 25 27 the services.
 25 28    Under current law, an entrepreneurial assistance provider is
 25 29 required to accept client referrals from the EDA as a condition
 25 30 of receiving a grant.  The division provides that the EDA may
 25 31 make client referrals to eligible providers.
 25 32    DIVISION IV ==== MISCELLANEOUS CHANGES.  Division IV makes
 25 33 several miscellaneous changes to other EDA programs.  The
 25 34 division amends the sales and use tax refund available under
 25 35 the workforce housing tax incentive program.  That refund
 26  1 is available for sales and use tax paid prior to project
 26  2 completion, which is currently defined to mean the first date
 26  3 upon which the average annualized production of finished
 26  4 product for the preceding 90=day period at the manufacturing
 26  5 facility operated by the eligible business is at least 50
 26  6 percent of the initial design capacity of the facility.  The
 26  7 division amends the definition of "project completion" to mean
 26  8 the date on which the EDA notifies the department of revenue
 26  9 that all applicable requirements of a workforce housing tax
 26 10 incentive program agreement are satisfied.  This provision
 26 11 takes effect upon enactment and applies retroactively to July
 26 12 1, 2014, for all workforce housing tax incentive agreements
 26 13 entered into on or after that date.
 26 14    The division allows the EDA to extend the project
 26 15 completion date for a project awarded tax incentives under the
 26 16 redevelopment tax credit program and the housing enterprise
 26 17 zone tax incentives program if the property that is the subject
 26 18 of the project suffered a catastrophic fire during the 2014
 26 19 calendar year.

 18  4    Sec. 38.  EFFECTIVE UPON ENACTMENT.  The section of this
 18  5 division of this Act amending section 15.355, being deemed of
 18  6 immediate importance, takes effect upon enactment.
 18  7    Sec. 39.  RETROACTIVE APPLICABILITY.  The section of
 18  8 this division of this Act amending section 15.355 applies
 18  9 retroactively to July 1, 2014, for all agreements entered into
 18 10 pursuant to section 15.354 on or after that date.
 18 11                           EXPLANATION
 18 12 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
 18 13 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
 18 14    This bill relates to the administration of programs by the
 18 15 economic development authority (EDA) by creating a renewable
 18 16 chemical production tax credit, modifying the tax credit for
 18 17 investments in qualifying businesses and community=based seed
 18 18 capital funds, and modifying the entrepreneur investment awards
 18 19 program.
 18 20    DIVISION I ==== RENEWABLE CHEMICAL PRODUCTION TAX CREDIT.
 18 21   Division I creates a renewable chemical production tax credit
 18 22 program (program) that will be administered by the EDA and that
 18 23 will provide tax credits to eligible businesses that produce
 18 24 renewable chemicals in Iowa from biomass feedstock.  "Renewable
 18 25 chemical", "biomass feedstock", and other related terms are
 18 26 defined in the division.
 18 27    In order to qualify for the tax credit, a business must
 18 28 meet several requirements.  First, the business must be
 18 29 physically located in Iowa and operated for profit under
 18 30 single management.  Second, the business must not be an
 18 31 entity providing professional services, health care services,
 18 32 or medical treatments, or be engaged primarily in retail
 18 33 operations.  Third, the business must have organized, expanded,
 18 34 or located in Iowa on or after the effective date of the
 18 35 division.  Fourth, the business must not be, in the discretion
 19  1 of the EDA, ineligible under certain provisions relating to the
 19  2 relocation or reduction of business operations within Iowa.
 19  3 Fifth, the business must be in compliance with all agreements
 19  4 entered into under the program or other programs administered
 19  5 by the EDA.
 19  6    An eligible business seeking a tax credit is required
 19  7 to apply to the EDA during the calendar year following the
 19  8 calendar year in which the renewable chemicals are produced.
 19  9 The application must include the amount of renewable chemicals
 19 10 produced in Iowa from biomass feedstock by the eligible
 19 11 business during the calendar year, measured in pounds, and any
 19 12 other information reasonably required by the EDA in order to
 19 13 establish and verify eligibility under the program.  The EDA
 19 14 may accept applications on a continuous basis or may establish
 19 15 an annual application deadline.
 19 16    Before being issued a tax credit, an eligible business
 19 17 is required to enter into an agreement with the EDA for the
 19 18 successful completion of all requirements of the program.  The
 19 19 EDA is authorized to impose two compliance cost fees under the
 19 20 program.  The first fee equals $500 per agreement.  The second
 19 21 fee equals 0.5 percent of the value of the tax credit claimed
 19 22 pursuant to the agreement if the agreement has an aggregate tax
 19 23 credit value of $100,000 or greater.
 19 24    An eligible business that fails to comply with the
 19 25 requirements of the program or the terms of an agreement with
 19 26 the EDA may have its tax credits reduced, terminated, or
 19 27 rescinded, and may be subject to the repayment or recapture of
 19 28 claimed tax credits.
 19 29    Upon determining that all requirements of an agreement and
 19 30 the program have been fulfilled, the EDA shall issue a tax
 19 31 credit and related tax credit certificate to the eligible
 19 32 business in an amount equal to the product of $.05 multiplied
 19 33 by the number of pounds of renewable chemicals produced in Iowa
 19 34 from biomass feedstock by the eligible business during the
 19 35 calendar year.  Renewable chemicals produced by an eligible
 20  1 business prior to the effective date of the division, or
 20  2 prior to the date the business first qualifies as an eligible
 20  3 business, or after calendar year 2025, shall not qualify for
 20  4 the tax credit.
 20  5    The tax credit shall be claimed for the tax year during
 20  6 which the eligible business was issued the tax credit.  The tax
 20  7 credit may be claimed against the individual income tax and the
 20  8 corporate income tax.  The credit is refundable or may, at the
 20  9 election of the taxpayer, be carried forward for up to one tax
 20 10 year.   The tax credit shall not be transferred to any person.  A
 20 11 tax credit issued to a partnership, limited liability company,
 20 12 S corporation, cooperative organized under Code chapter 501
 20 13 and filing as a partnership for federal tax purposes, estate,
 20 14 or trust electing to have the income taxed directly to the
 20 15 individual may be claimed by the individual based upon the pro
 20 16 rata share of the individual's earnings from that entity.
 20 17    The division provides that the program is subject to the
 20 18 EDA's maximum aggregate tax credit cap of $170 million per
 20 19 fiscal year in Code section 15.119, and not more than $15
 20 20 million per fiscal year may be issued by the EDA under the
 20 21 program.  In addition, the maximum amount of tax credit that
 20 22 may be issued to an eligible business in any one calendar year
 20 23 shall not exceed $1 million or $500,000, depending on whether
 20 24 the eligible business has been operating in Iowa at the time of
 20 25 application for five or fewer years, or more than five years,
 20 26 respectively.  An eligible business shall not receive more than
 20 27 five tax credits under the program.  The EDA is required to
 20 28 issue tax credits on a first=come, first=served basis until the
 20 29 maximum amount of $15 million per fiscal year is reached.  If
 20 30 the amount of tax credits exceeds this amount in a fiscal year,
 20 31 the EDA is required to establish a wait list and give priority
 20 32 in subsequent years to the eligible businesses on the wait
 20 33 list.
 20 34    The division provides for the confidentiality of certain
 20 35 information under the program.  The identity of a tax credit
 21  1 recipient and the amount of the tax credit shall be considered
 21  2 public information under Code chapter 22 (examination of public
 21  3 records), but any other information or record in the possession
 21  4 of the EDA with respect to the program shall be presumed by
 21  5 the EDA to be a trade secret protected under Code chapter 550
 21  6 or common law and shall be kept confidential by the EDA unless
 21  7 otherwise ordered by a court.
 21  8    The division takes effect upon enactment and applies to
 21  9 renewable chemicals produced in Iowa from biomass feedstock on
 21 10 or after that date.  The division applies retroactively to tax
 21 11 years beginning on or after January 1, 2015.
 21 12    DIVISION II ==== ANGEL INVESTOR TAX CREDITS.   Division II
 21 13 makes several changes to the tax credit for investments in
 21 14 qualifying businesses and community=based seed capital funds,
 21 15 often referred to as the angel investor tax credits.  The
 21 16 division amends the purpose of the tax credit in Code section
 21 17 15E.41.  The division excludes investments in community=based
 21 18 seed capital funds from qualifying for the tax credit and
 21 19 makes several conforming amendments to remove references to
 21 20 community=based seed capital funds from the Code.
 21 21    The division modifies the amount and dollar limitation of
 21 22 the tax credit for a taxpayer.  The tax credit is increased
 21 23 from 20 percent to 25 percent of a taxpayer's equity investment
 21 24 in a qualifying business.  Under current law, a taxpayer cannot
 21 25 claim more than $50,000 of tax credit per investment in a
 21 26 qualifying business, and for each tax year a taxpayer and the
 21 27 taxpayer's affiliates cannot claim tax credits for more than
 21 28 five investments in five different qualifying businesses.  The
 21 29 division amends this dollar limitation to prohibit a natural
 21 30 person and the person's spouse, child, or sibling from claiming
 21 31 a combined amount of more than $100,000 in tax credits per tax
 21 32 year.
 21 33    The division also provides that no more than $500,000 in tax
 21 34 credits may be issued per tax year for equity investments in
 21 35 any one qualifying business.
 22  1 The division modifies the procedures for claiming the tax
 22  2 credit.  Under current law, the tax credit is not refundable
 22  3 but available for carryforward for up to five tax years.  The
 22  4 division makes the tax credit refundable for an investment
 22  5 made by a natural person, and for any other person reduces the
 22  6 carryforward period to three years.
 22  7    The division strikes a provision permitting the EDA
 22  8 to cooperate with small business development centers to
 22  9 disseminate information regarding the credits and to develop
 22 10 standard application forms, and requiring the EDA to distribute
 22 11 copies of the application forms to all community=based seed
 22 12 capital funds and potential individual investors.
 22 13    The division modifies the eligibility requirements for
 22 14 qualifying businesses.  The division strikes the requirement
 22 15 that a business have an owner that meets at least one of
 22 16 four qualifications relating to business education or
 22 17 business experience.  The division requires that a business
 22 18 be participating in an entrepreneurial assistance program,
 22 19 as defined in the division, but allows the EDA to waive this
 22 20 requirement if the business establishes that its owners,
 22 21 directors, officers, and employees have an appropriate level
 22 22 of experience such that an entrepreneurial assistance program
 22 23 would not materially change the prospects of the business.
 22 24 The EDA is allowed to consult with outside service providers
 22 25 in considering such a waiver.  The division increases from $5
 22 26 million to $10 million the maximum amount of net worth that
 22 27 a business may have to be considered a qualifying business.
 22 28 The division increases from $250,000 to $500,000 the amount of
 22 29 financing that a business must have in order to be considered a
 22 30 qualifying business, removes "near equity" from the types of
 22 31 financing that will be considered in that calculation, requires
 22 32 that the financing be secured at the time of application for
 22 33 the tax credits, and requires that the business have at least
 22 34 two investors at the time of application for the tax credits.
 22 35 These modified eligibility requirements apply to businesses
 23  1 that submit an application to the EDA to be registered as a
 23  2 qualifying business on or after the effective date of this
 23  3 division of the bill, and businesses that submitted such an
 23  4 application to the EDA before the effective date of this
 23  5 division of the bill shall be governed by current law.
 23  6    The division provides for the confidentiality of certain
 23  7 information with regard to the tax credit.  The identity of
 23  8 a qualifying business, the identity of an investor and the
 23  9 qualifying business in which the investor made an equity
 23 10 investment, and the total number and amount of tax credits
 23 11 issued shall be considered public information under Code
 23 12 chapter 22 (examination of public records), but any other
 23 13 information or record in the possession of the EDA with respect
 23 14 to the program shall be presumed by the EDA to be a trade secret
 23 15 protected under Code chapter 550 or common law and shall be
 23 16 kept confidential by the EDA unless otherwise ordered by a
 23 17 court.
 23 18    The division takes effect upon enactment and applies to
 23 19 equity investments in a qualifying business made on or after
 23 20 that date.  Equity investments in a qualifying business or
 23 21 community=based seed capital fund made prior to the effective
 23 22 date of the division shall be governed by current law.
 23 23    DIVISION III ==== ENTREPRENEUR INVESTMENT AWARDS PROGRAM.
 23 24  Division III amends the entrepreneur investment awards program
 23 25 administered by the EDA.  The division strikes provisions that
 23 26 prohibited the EDA from making awards under the program since
 23 27 July 1, 2014, and that required the EDA by December 31, 2014,
 23 28 to conduct a comprehensive review of the program and submit
 23 29 a report with specified information to the governor and the
 23 30 general assembly.
 23 31    The division modifies the purpose of the program to be
 23 32 to provide financial assistance to eligible entrepreneurial
 23 33 assistance providers (provider) that provide technical and
 23 34 financial assistance to entrepreneurs and start=up companies
 23 35 seeking to create, locate, or expand a business in Iowa.
 24  1 "Financial assistance" is defined in the division.
 24  2    The division changes the requirements for receiving an
 24  3 award.  To be eligible to receive an award under current
 24  4 law, an entrepreneurial assistance program must have been
 24  5 an Iowa=based business, expended at least $500,000 during
 24  6 the previous fiscal year to provide technical and financial
 24  7 assistance services that meet the broad=based needs of
 24  8 entrepreneurs seeking to create, locate, or expand a business
 24  9 in Iowa that intends to derive more than 10 percent of its
 24 10 gross sales from markets outside Iowa; and must have engaged
 24 11 and communicated with certain other programs, funding sources,
 24 12 and entities for its entrepreneur clients.  The division
 24 13 amends the eligibility for receiving financial assistance to
 24 14 require that a provider have its principal place of operations
 24 15 in Iowa and that the provider offer a comprehensive set of
 24 16 business development services to emerging and early=stage
 24 17 innovation companies to assist in the creation, location,
 24 18 growth, and long=term success of the company in Iowa.
 24 19 "Business development services" is defined in the division.
 24 20 Business development services may be performed at the physical
 24 21 location of the provider or the company and may be provided in
 24 22 consideration of equity participation in the company, a fee for
 24 23 services, or a membership agreement with the company.
 24 24    Under current law, the EDA board could approve, deny, or
 24 25 defer each application for a grant, and was required to award
 24 26 grants on a first=come, first=served basis.  The division
 24 27 specifies that the EDA board has the discretion to approve,
 24 28 deny, or defer each application for financial assistance and
 24 29 that the amount of financial assistance awarded to a provider
 24 30 is within the discretion of the EDA.  The division requires
 24 31 the EDA to award financial assistance on a competitive basis
 24 32 and allows the EDA to develop scoring criteria and establish
 24 33 minimum requirements for the receipt of a financial assistance
 24 34 award.
 24 35    In addition to the four factors relating to the provider's
 25  1 professional staff that the EDA may consider under current
 25  2 law in deciding whether to award financial assistance, the
 25  3 division provides that the EDA may also consider the service
 25  4 model and likelihood of success of the provider, the provider's
 25  5 similarity to other successful providers in the country, and
 25  6 the provider's financial need.
 25  7    The division modifies the maximum award amount for a
 25  8 recipient.  Under current law, a grant to an entrepreneur
 25  9 assistance program cannot exceed the lesser of 25 percent of
 25 10 the funds expended by the program during the previous fiscal
 25 11 year, 100 percent of the funds raised from certain persons
 25 12 by the program during the previous fiscal year, or $200,000.
 25 13 The division provides that the amount of financial assistance
 25 14 awarded to any one provider shall not exceed $200,000.
 25 15    The division modifies the permitted use of funds received
 25 16 under the program.  Under current law, grants are only
 25 17 permitted to be used for the purpose of operating costs
 25 18 incurred by the program.  The division specifies that financial
 25 19 assistance awarded to a provider shall only be used for
 25 20 the purpose of operating costs incurred by the provider in
 25 21 the provision of business development services to emerging
 25 22 and early=stage innovation companies in Iowa.  The division
 25 23 further requires that such financial assistance shall not be
 25 24 distributed to owners or investors of the company to which the
 25 25 business development services are being provided and shall not
 25 26 be provided to other persons assisting with the provision of
 25 27 the services.
 25 28    Under current law, an entrepreneurial assistance provider is
 25 29 required to accept client referrals from the EDA as a condition
 25 30 of receiving a grant.  The division provides that the EDA may
 25 31 make client referrals to eligible providers.
 25 32    DIVISION IV ==== MISCELLANEOUS CHANGES.  Division IV makes
 25 33 several miscellaneous changes to other EDA programs.  The
 25 34 division amends the sales and use tax refund available under
 25 35 the workforce housing tax incentive program.  That refund
 26  1 is available for sales and use tax paid prior to project
 26  2 completion, which is currently defined to mean the first date
 26  3 upon which the average annualized production of finished
 26  4 product for the preceding 90=day period at the manufacturing
 26  5 facility operated by the eligible business is at least 50
 26  6 percent of the initial design capacity of the facility.  The
 26  7 division amends the definition of "project completion" to mean
 26  8 the date on which the EDA notifies the department of revenue
 26  9 that all applicable requirements of a workforce housing tax
 26 10 incentive program agreement are satisfied.  This provision
 26 11 takes effect upon enactment and applies retroactively to July
 26 12 1, 2014, for all workforce housing tax incentive agreements
 26 13 entered into on or after that date.
 26 14    The division allows the EDA to extend the project
 26 15 completion date for a project awarded tax incentives under the
 26 16 redevelopment tax credit program and the housing enterprise
 26 17 zone tax incentives program if the property that is the subject
 26 18 of the project suffered a catastrophic fire during the 2014
 26 19 calendar year.

 18  4    Sec. 38.  EFFECTIVE UPON ENACTMENT.  The section of this
 18  5 division of this Act amending section 15.355, being deemed of
 18  6 immediate importance, takes effect upon enactment.
 18  7    Sec. 39.  RETROACTIVE APPLICABILITY.  The section of
 18  8 this division of this Act amending section 15.355 applies
 18  9 retroactively to July 1, 2014, for all agreements entered into
 18 10 pursuant to section 15.354 on or after that date.
 18 11                           EXPLANATION
 18 12 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
 18 13 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
 18 14    This bill relates to the administration of programs by the
 18 15 economic development authority (EDA) by creating a renewable
 18 16 chemical production tax credit, modifying the tax credit for
 18 17 investments in qualifying businesses and community=based seed
 18 18 capital funds, and modifying the entrepreneur investment awards
 18 19 program.
 18 20    DIVISION I ==== RENEWABLE CHEMICAL PRODUCTION TAX CREDIT.
 18 21   Division I creates a renewable chemical production tax credit
 18 22 program (program) that will be administered by the EDA and that
 18 23 will provide tax credits to eligible businesses that produce
 18 24 renewable chemicals in Iowa from biomass feedstock.  "Renewable
 18 25 chemical", "biomass feedstock", and other related terms are
 18 26 defined in the division.
 18 27    In order to qualify for the tax credit, a business must
 18 28 meet several requirements.  First, the business must be
 18 29 physically located in Iowa and operated for profit under
 18 30 single management.  Second, the business must not be an
 18 31 entity providing professional services, health care services,
 18 32 or medical treatments, or be engaged primarily in retail
 18 33 operations.  Third, the business must have organized, expanded,
 18 34 or located in Iowa on or after the effective date of the
 18 35 division.  Fourth, the business must not be, in the discretion
 19  1 of the EDA, ineligible under certain provisions relating to the
 19  2 relocation or reduction of business operations within Iowa.
 19  3 Fifth, the business must be in compliance with all agreements
 19  4 entered into under the program or other programs administered
 19  5 by the EDA.
 19  6    An eligible business seeking a tax credit is required
 19  7 to apply to the EDA during the calendar year following the
 19  8 calendar year in which the renewable chemicals are produced.
 19  9 The application must include the amount of renewable chemicals
 19 10 produced in Iowa from biomass feedstock by the eligible
 19 11 business during the calendar year, measured in pounds, and any
 19 12 other information reasonably required by the EDA in order to
 19 13 establish and verify eligibility under the program.  The EDA
 19 14 may accept applications on a continuous basis or may establish
 19 15 an annual application deadline.
 19 16    Before being issued a tax credit, an eligible business
 19 17 is required to enter into an agreement with the EDA for the
 19 18 successful completion of all requirements of the program.  The
 19 19 EDA is authorized to impose two compliance cost fees under the
 19 20 program.  The first fee equals $500 per agreement.  The second
 19 21 fee equals 0.5 percent of the value of the tax credit claimed
 19 22 pursuant to the agreement if the agreement has an aggregate tax
 19 23 credit value of $100,000 or greater.
 19 24    An eligible business that fails to comply with the
 19 25 requirements of the program or the terms of an agreement with
 19 26 the EDA may have its tax credits reduced, terminated, or
 19 27 rescinded, and may be subject to the repayment or recapture of
 19 28 claimed tax credits.
 19 29    Upon determining that all requirements of an agreement and
 19 30 the program have been fulfilled, the EDA shall issue a tax
 19 31 credit and related tax credit certificate to the eligible
 19 32 business in an amount equal to the product of $.05 multiplied
 19 33 by the number of pounds of renewable chemicals produced in Iowa
 19 34 from biomass feedstock by the eligible business during the
 19 35 calendar year.  Renewable chemicals produced by an eligible
 20  1 business prior to the effective date of the division, or
 20  2 prior to the date the business first qualifies as an eligible
 20  3 business, or after calendar year 2025, shall not qualify for
 20  4 the tax credit.
 20  5    The tax credit shall be claimed for the tax year during
 20  6 which the eligible business was issued the tax credit.  The tax
 20  7 credit may be claimed against the individual income tax and the
 20  8 corporate income tax.  The credit is refundable or may, at the
 20  9 election of the taxpayer, be carried forward for up to one tax
 20 10 year.   The tax credit shall not be transferred to any person.  A
 20 11 tax credit issued to a partnership, limited liability company,
 20 12 S corporation, cooperative organized under Code chapter 501
 20 13 and filing as a partnership for federal tax purposes, estate,
 20 14 or trust electing to have the income taxed directly to the
 20 15 individual may be claimed by the individual based upon the pro
 20 16 rata share of the individual's earnings from that entity.
 20 17    The division provides that the program is subject to the
 20 18 EDA's maximum aggregate tax credit cap of $170 million per
 20 19 fiscal year in Code section 15.119, and not more than $15
 20 20 million per fiscal year may be issued by the EDA under the
 20 21 program.  In addition, the maximum amount of tax credit that
 20 22 may be issued to an eligible business in any one calendar year
 20 23 shall not exceed $1 million or $500,000, depending on whether
 20 24 the eligible business has been operating in Iowa at the time of
 20 25 application for five or fewer years, or more than five years,
 20 26 respectively.  An eligible business shall not receive more than
 20 27 five tax credits under the program.  The EDA is required to
 20 28 issue tax credits on a first=come, first=served basis until the
 20 29 maximum amount of $15 million per fiscal year is reached.  If
 20 30 the amount of tax credits exceeds this amount in a fiscal year,
 20 31 the EDA is required to establish a wait list and give priority
 20 32 in subsequent years to the eligible businesses on the wait
 20 33 list.
 20 34    The division provides for the confidentiality of certain
 20 35 information under the program.  The identity of a tax credit
 21  1 recipient and the amount of the tax credit shall be considered
 21  2 public information under Code chapter 22 (examination of public
 21  3 records), but any other information or record in the possession
 21  4 of the EDA with respect to the program shall be presumed by
 21  5 the EDA to be a trade secret protected under Code chapter 550
 21  6 or common law and shall be kept confidential by the EDA unless
 21  7 otherwise ordered by a court.
 21  8    The division takes effect upon enactment and applies to
 21  9 renewable chemicals produced in Iowa from biomass feedstock on
 21 10 or after that date.  The division applies retroactively to tax
 21 11 years beginning on or after January 1, 2015.
 21 12    DIVISION II ==== ANGEL INVESTOR TAX CREDITS.   Division II
 21 13 makes several changes to the tax credit for investments in
 21 14 qualifying businesses and community=based seed capital funds,
 21 15 often referred to as the angel investor tax credits.  The
 21 16 division amends the purpose of the tax credit in Code section
 21 17 15E.41.  The division excludes investments in community=based
 21 18 seed capital funds from qualifying for the tax credit and
 21 19 makes several conforming amendments to remove references to
 21 20 community=based seed capital funds from the Code.
 21 21    The division modifies the amount and dollar limitation of
 21 22 the tax credit for a taxpayer.  The tax credit is increased
 21 23 from 20 percent to 25 percent of a taxpayer's equity investment
 21 24 in a qualifying business.  Under current law, a taxpayer cannot
 21 25 claim more than $50,000 of tax credit per investment in a
 21 26 qualifying business, and for each tax year a taxpayer and the
 21 27 taxpayer's affiliates cannot claim tax credits for more than
 21 28 five investments in five different qualifying businesses.  The
 21 29 division amends this dollar limitation to prohibit a natural
 21 30 person and the person's spouse, child, or sibling from claiming
 21 31 a combined amount of more than $100,000 in tax credits per tax
 21 32 year.
 21 33    The division also provides that no more than $500,000 in tax
 21 34 credits may be issued per tax year for equity investments in
 21 35 any one qualifying business.
 22  1 The division modifies the procedures for claiming the tax
 22  2 credit.  Under current law, the tax credit is not refundable
 22  3 but available for carryforward for up to five tax years.  The
 22  4 division makes the tax credit refundable for an investment
 22  5 made by a natural person, and for any other person reduces the
 22  6 carryforward period to three years.
 22  7    The division strikes a provision permitting the EDA
 22  8 to cooperate with small business development centers to
 22  9 disseminate information regarding the credits and to develop
 22 10 standard application forms, and requiring the EDA to distribute
 22 11 copies of the application forms to all community=based seed
 22 12 capital funds and potential individual investors.
 22 13    The division modifies the eligibility requirements for
 22 14 qualifying businesses.  The division strikes the requirement
 22 15 that a business have an owner that meets at least one of
 22 16 four qualifications relating to business education or
 22 17 business experience.  The division requires that a business
 22 18 be participating in an entrepreneurial assistance program,
 22 19 as defined in the division, but allows the EDA to waive this
 22 20 requirement if the business establishes that its owners,
 22 21 directors, officers, and employees have an appropriate level
 22 22 of experience such that an entrepreneurial assistance program
 22 23 would not materially change the prospects of the business.
 22 24 The EDA is allowed to consult with outside service providers
 22 25 in considering such a waiver.  The division increases from $5
 22 26 million to $10 million the maximum amount of net worth that
 22 27 a business may have to be considered a qualifying business.
 22 28 The division increases from $250,000 to $500,000 the amount of
 22 29 financing that a business must have in order to be considered a
 22 30 qualifying business, removes "near equity" from the types of
 22 31 financing that will be considered in that calculation, requires
 22 32 that the financing be secured at the time of application for
 22 33 the tax credits, and requires that the business have at least
 22 34 two investors at the time of application for the tax credits.
 22 35 These modified eligibility requirements apply to businesses
 23  1 that submit an application to the EDA to be registered as a
 23  2 qualifying business on or after the effective date of this
 23  3 division of the bill, and businesses that submitted such an
 23  4 application to the EDA before the effective date of this
 23  5 division of the bill shall be governed by current law.
 23  6    The division provides for the confidentiality of certain
 23  7 information with regard to the tax credit.  The identity of
 23  8 a qualifying business, the identity of an investor and the
 23  9 qualifying business in which the investor made an equity
 23 10 investment, and the total number and amount of tax credits
 23 11 issued shall be considered public information under Code
 23 12 chapter 22 (examination of public records), but any other
 23 13 information or record in the possession of the EDA with respect
 23 14 to the program shall be presumed by the EDA to be a trade secret
 23 15 protected under Code chapter 550 or common law and shall be
 23 16 kept confidential by the EDA unless otherwise ordered by a
 23 17 court.
 23 18    The division takes effect upon enactment and applies to
 23 19 equity investments in a qualifying business made on or after
 23 20 that date.  Equity investments in a qualifying business or
 23 21 community=based seed capital fund made prior to the effective
 23 22 date of the division shall be governed by current law.
 23 23    DIVISION III ==== ENTREPRENEUR INVESTMENT AWARDS PROGRAM.
 23 24  Division III amends the entrepreneur investment awards program
 23 25 administered by the EDA.  The division strikes provisions that
 23 26 prohibited the EDA from making awards under the program since
 23 27 July 1, 2014, and that required the EDA by December 31, 2014,
 23 28 to conduct a comprehensive review of the program and submit
 23 29 a report with specified information to the governor and the
 23 30 general assembly.
 23 31    The division modifies the purpose of the program to be
 23 32 to provide financial assistance to eligible entrepreneurial
 23 33 assistance providers (provider) that provide technical and
 23 34 financial assistance to entrepreneurs and start=up companies
 23 35 seeking to create, locate, or expand a business in Iowa.
 24  1 "Financial assistance" is defined in the division.
 24  2    The division changes the requirements for receiving an
 24  3 award.  To be eligible to receive an award under current
 24  4 law, an entrepreneurial assistance program must have been
 24  5 an Iowa=based business, expended at least $500,000 during
 24  6 the previous fiscal year to provide technical and financial
 24  7 assistance services that meet the broad=based needs of
 24  8 entrepreneurs seeking to create, locate, or expand a business
 24  9 in Iowa that intends to derive more than 10 percent of its
 24 10 gross sales from markets outside Iowa; and must have engaged
 24 11 and communicated with certain other programs, funding sources,
 24 12 and entities for its entrepreneur clients.  The division
 24 13 amends the eligibility for receiving financial assistance to
 24 14 require that a provider have its principal place of operations
 24 15 in Iowa and that the provider offer a comprehensive set of
 24 16 business development services to emerging and early=stage
 24 17 innovation companies to assist in the creation, location,
 24 18 growth, and long=term success of the company in Iowa.
 24 19 "Business development services" is defined in the division.
 24 20 Business development services may be performed at the physical
 24 21 location of the provider or the company and may be provided in
 24 22 consideration of equity participation in the company, a fee for
 24 23 services, or a membership agreement with the company.
 24 24    Under current law, the EDA board could approve, deny, or
 24 25 defer each application for a grant, and was required to award
 24 26 grants on a first=come, first=served basis.  The division
 24 27 specifies that the EDA board has the discretion to approve,
 24 28 deny, or defer each application for financial assistance and
 24 29 that the amount of financial assistance awarded to a provider
 24 30 is within the discretion of the EDA.  The division requires
 24 31 the EDA to award financial assistance on a competitive basis
 24 32 and allows the EDA to develop scoring criteria and establish
 24 33 minimum requirements for the receipt of a financial assistance
 24 34 award.
 24 35    In addition to the four factors relating to the provider's
 25  1 professional staff that the EDA may consider under current
 25  2 law in deciding whether to award financial assistance, the
 25  3 division provides that the EDA may also consider the service
 25  4 model and likelihood of success of the provider, the provider's
 25  5 similarity to other successful providers in the country, and
 25  6 the provider's financial need.
 25  7    The division modifies the maximum award amount for a
 25  8 recipient.  Under current law, a grant to an entrepreneur
 25  9 assistance program cannot exceed the lesser of 25 percent of
 25 10 the funds expended by the program during the previous fiscal
 25 11 year, 100 percent of the funds raised from certain persons
 25 12 by the program during the previous fiscal year, or $200,000.
 25 13 The division provides that the amount of financial assistance
 25 14 awarded to any one provider shall not exceed $200,000.
 25 15    The division modifies the permitted use of funds received
 25 16 under the program.  Under current law, grants are only
 25 17 permitted to be used for the purpose of operating costs
 25 18 incurred by the program.  The division specifies that financial
 25 19 assistance awarded to a provider shall only be used for
 25 20 the purpose of operating costs incurred by the provider in
 25 21 the provision of business development services to emerging
 25 22 and early=stage innovation companies in Iowa.  The division
 25 23 further requires that such financial assistance shall not be
 25 24 distributed to owners or investors of the company to which the
 25 25 business development services are being provided and shall not
 25 26 be provided to other persons assisting with the provision of
 25 27 the services.
 25 28    Under current law, an entrepreneurial assistance provider is
 25 29 required to accept client referrals from the EDA as a condition
 25 30 of receiving a grant.  The division provides that the EDA may
 25 31 make client referrals to eligible providers.
 25 32    DIVISION IV ==== MISCELLANEOUS CHANGES.  Division IV makes
 25 33 several miscellaneous changes to other EDA programs.  The
 25 34 division amends the sales and use tax refund available under
 25 35 the workforce housing tax incentive program.  That refund
 26  1 is available for sales and use tax paid prior to project
 26  2 completion, which is currently defined to mean the first date
 26  3 upon which the average annualized production of finished
 26  4 product for the preceding 90=day period at the manufacturing
 26  5 facility operated by the eligible business is at least 50
 26  6 percent of the initial design capacity of the facility.  The
 26  7 division amends the definition of "project completion" to mean
 26  8 the date on which the EDA notifies the department of revenue
 26  9 that all applicable requirements of a workforce housing tax
 26 10 incentive program agreement are satisfied.  This provision
 26 11 takes effect upon enactment and applies retroactively to July
 26 12 1, 2014, for all workforce housing tax incentive agreements
 26 13 entered into on or after that date.
 26 14    The division allows the EDA to extend the project
 26 15 completion date for a project awarded tax incentives under the
 26 16 redevelopment tax credit program and the housing enterprise
 26 17 zone tax incentives program if the property that is the subject
 26 18 of the project suffered a catastrophic fire during the 2014
 26 19 calendar year.

 18  6 immediate importance, takes effect upon enactment.
 18  7    Sec. 39.  RETROACTIVE APPLICABILITY.  The section of
 18  8 this division of this Act amending section 15.355 applies

 18 11                           EXPLANATION
 18 12 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
 18 13 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
 18 14    This bill relates to the administration of programs by the
 18 15 economic development authority (EDA) by creating a renewable
 18 16 chemical production tax credit, modifying the tax credit for
 18 17 investments in qualifying businesses and community=based seed
 18 18 capital funds, and modifying the entrepreneur investment awards
 18 19 program.
 18 20    DIVISION I ==== RENEWABLE CHEMICAL PRODUCTION TAX CREDIT.
 18 21   Division I creates a renewable chemical production tax credit
 18 22 program (program) that will be administered by the EDA and that
 18 23 will provide tax credits to eligible businesses that produce
 18 24 renewable chemicals in Iowa from biomass feedstock.  "Renewable
 18 25 chemical", "biomass feedstock", and other related terms are
 18 26 defined in the division.
 18 27    In order to qualify for the tax credit, a business must
 18 28 meet several requirements.  First, the business must be
 18 29 physically located in Iowa and operated for profit under
 18 30 single management.  Second, the business must not be an
 18 31 entity providing professional services, health care services,
 18 32 or medical treatments, or be engaged primarily in retail
 18 33 operations.  Third, the business must have organized, expanded,
 18 34 or located in Iowa on or after the effective date of the
 18 35 division.  Fourth, the business must not be, in the discretion
 19  1 of the EDA, ineligible under certain provisions relating to the
 19  2 relocation or reduction of business operations within Iowa.
 19  3 Fifth, the business must be in compliance with all agreements
 19  4 entered into under the program or other programs administered
 19  5 by the EDA.
 19  6    An eligible business seeking a tax credit is required
 19  7 to apply to the EDA during the calendar year following the
 19  8 calendar year in which the renewable chemicals are produced.
 19  9 The application must include the amount of renewable chemicals
 19 10 produced in Iowa from biomass feedstock by the eligible
 19 11 business during the calendar year, measured in pounds, and any
 19 12 other information reasonably required by the EDA in order to
 19 13 establish and verify eligibility under the program.  The EDA
 19 14 may accept applications on a continuous basis or may establish
 19 15 an annual application deadline.
 19 16    Before being issued a tax credit, an eligible business
 19 17 is required to enter into an agreement with the EDA for the
 19 18 successful completion of all requirements of the program.  The
 19 19 EDA is authorized to impose two compliance cost fees under the
 19 20 program.  The first fee equals $500 per agreement.  The second
 19 21 fee equals 0.5 percent of the value of the tax credit claimed
 19 22 pursuant to the agreement if the agreement has an aggregate tax
 19 23 credit value of $100,000 or greater.
 19 24    An eligible business that fails to comply with the
 19 25 requirements of the program or the terms of an agreement with
 19 26 the EDA may have its tax credits reduced, terminated, or
 19 27 rescinded, and may be subject to the repayment or recapture of
 19 28 claimed tax credits.
 19 29    Upon determining that all requirements of an agreement and
 19 30 the program have been fulfilled, the EDA shall issue a tax
 19 31 credit and related tax credit certificate to the eligible
 19 32 business in an amount equal to the product of $.05 multiplied
 19 33 by the number of pounds of renewable chemicals produced in Iowa
 19 34 from biomass feedstock by the eligible business during the
 19 35 calendar year.  Renewable chemicals produced by an eligible
 20  1 business prior to the effective date of the division, or
 20  2 prior to the date the business first qualifies as an eligible
 20  3 business, or after calendar year 2025, shall not qualify for
 20  4 the tax credit.
 20  5    The tax credit shall be claimed for the tax year during
 20  6 which the eligible business was issued the tax credit.  The tax
 20  7 credit may be claimed against the individual income tax and the
 20  8 corporate income tax.  The credit is refundable or may, at the
 20  9 election of the taxpayer, be carried forward for up to one tax
 20 10 year.   The tax credit shall not be transferred to any person.  A
 20 11 tax credit issued to a partnership, limited liability company,
 20 12 S corporation, cooperative organized under Code chapter 501
 20 13 and filing as a partnership for federal tax purposes, estate,
 20 14 or trust electing to have the income taxed directly to the
 20 15 individual may be claimed by the individual based upon the pro
 20 16 rata share of the individual's earnings from that entity.
 20 17    The division provides that the program is subject to the
 20 18 EDA's maximum aggregate tax credit cap of $170 million per
 20 19 fiscal year in Code section 15.119, and not more than $15
 20 20 million per fiscal year may be issued by the EDA under the
 20 21 program.  In addition, the maximum amount of tax credit that
 20 22 may be issued to an eligible business in any one calendar year
 20 23 shall not exceed $1 million or $500,000, depending on whether
 20 24 the eligible business has been operating in Iowa at the time of
 20 25 application for five or fewer years, or more than five years,
 20 26 respectively.  An eligible business shall not receive more than
 20 27 five tax credits under the program.  The EDA is required to
 20 28 issue tax credits on a first=come, first=served basis until the
 20 29 maximum amount of $15 million per fiscal year is reached.  If
 20 30 the amount of tax credits exceeds this amount in a fiscal year,
 20 31 the EDA is required to establish a wait list and give priority
 20 32 in subsequent years to the eligible businesses on the wait
 20 33 list.
 20 34    The division provides for the confidentiality of certain
 20 35 information under the program.  The identity of a tax credit
 21  1 recipient and the amount of the tax credit shall be considered
 21  2 public information under Code chapter 22 (examination of public
 21  3 records), but any other information or record in the possession
 21  4 of the EDA with respect to the program shall be presumed by
 21  5 the EDA to be a trade secret protected under Code chapter 550
 21  6 or common law and shall be kept confidential by the EDA unless
 21  7 otherwise ordered by a court.
 21  8    The division takes effect upon enactment and applies to
 21  9 renewable chemicals produced in Iowa from biomass feedstock on
 21 10 or after that date.  The division applies retroactively to tax
 21 11 years beginning on or after January 1, 2015.
 21 12    DIVISION II ==== ANGEL INVESTOR TAX CREDITS.   Division II
 21 13 makes several changes to the tax credit for investments in
 21 14 qualifying businesses and community=based seed capital funds,
 21 15 often referred to as the angel investor tax credits.  The
 21 16 division amends the purpose of the tax credit in Code section
 21 17 15E.41.  The division excludes investments in community=based
 21 18 seed capital funds from qualifying for the tax credit and
 21 19 makes several conforming amendments to remove references to
 21 20 community=based seed capital funds from the Code.
 21 21    The division modifies the amount and dollar limitation of
 21 22 the tax credit for a taxpayer.  The tax credit is increased
 21 23 from 20 percent to 25 percent of a taxpayer's equity investment
 21 24 in a qualifying business.  Under current law, a taxpayer cannot
 21 25 claim more than $50,000 of tax credit per investment in a
 21 26 qualifying business, and for each tax year a taxpayer and the
 21 27 taxpayer's affiliates cannot claim tax credits for more than
 21 28 five investments in five different qualifying businesses.  The
 21 29 division amends this dollar limitation to prohibit a natural
 21 30 person and the person's spouse, child, or sibling from claiming
 21 31 a combined amount of more than $100,000 in tax credits per tax
 21 32 year.
 21 33    The division also provides that no more than $500,000 in tax
 21 34 credits may be issued per tax year for equity investments in
 21 35 any one qualifying business.
 22  1 The division modifies the procedures for claiming the tax
 22  2 credit.  Under current law, the tax credit is not refundable
 22  3 but available for carryforward for up to five tax years.  The
 22  4 division makes the tax credit refundable for an investment
 22  5 made by a natural person, and for any other person reduces the
 22  6 carryforward period to three years.
 22  7    The division strikes a provision permitting the EDA
 22  8 to cooperate with small business development centers to
 22  9 disseminate information regarding the credits and to develop
 22 10 standard application forms, and requiring the EDA to distribute
 22 11 copies of the application forms to all community=based seed
 22 12 capital funds and potential individual investors.
 22 13    The division modifies the eligibility requirements for
 22 14 qualifying businesses.  The division strikes the requirement
 22 15 that a business have an owner that meets at least one of
 22 16 four qualifications relating to business education or
 22 17 business experience.  The division requires that a business
 22 18 be participating in an entrepreneurial assistance program,
 22 19 as defined in the division, but allows the EDA to waive this
 22 20 requirement if the business establishes that its owners,
 22 21 directors, officers, and employees have an appropriate level
 22 22 of experience such that an entrepreneurial assistance program
 22 23 would not materially change the prospects of the business.
 22 24 The EDA is allowed to consult with outside service providers
 22 25 in considering such a waiver.  The division increases from $5
 22 26 million to $10 million the maximum amount of net worth that
 22 27 a business may have to be considered a qualifying business.
 22 28 The division increases from $250,000 to $500,000 the amount of
 22 29 financing that a business must have in order to be considered a
 22 30 qualifying business, removes "near equity" from the types of
 22 31 financing that will be considered in that calculation, requires
 22 32 that the financing be secured at the time of application for
 22 33 the tax credits, and requires that the business have at least
 22 34 two investors at the time of application for the tax credits.
 22 35 These modified eligibility requirements apply to businesses
 23  1 that submit an application to the EDA to be registered as a
 23  2 qualifying business on or after the effective date of this
 23  3 division of the bill, and businesses that submitted such an
 23  4 application to the EDA before the effective date of this
 23  5 division of the bill shall be governed by current law.
 23  6    The division provides for the confidentiality of certain
 23  7 information with regard to the tax credit.  The identity of
 23  8 a qualifying business, the identity of an investor and the
 23  9 qualifying business in which the investor made an equity
 23 10 investment, and the total number and amount of tax credits
 23 11 issued shall be considered public information under Code
 23 12 chapter 22 (examination of public records), but any other
 23 13 information or record in the possession of the EDA with respect
 23 14 to the program shall be presumed by the EDA to be a trade secret
 23 15 protected under Code chapter 550 or common law and shall be
 23 16 kept confidential by the EDA unless otherwise ordered by a
 23 17 court.
 23 18    The division takes effect upon enactment and applies to
 23 19 equity investments in a qualifying business made on or after
 23 20 that date.  Equity investments in a qualifying business or
 23 21 community=based seed capital fund made prior to the effective
 23 22 date of the division shall be governed by current law.
 23 23    DIVISION III ==== ENTREPRENEUR INVESTMENT AWARDS PROGRAM.
 23 24  Division III amends the entrepreneur investment awards program
 23 25 administered by the EDA.  The division strikes provisions that
 23 26 prohibited the EDA from making awards under the program since
 23 27 July 1, 2014, and that required the EDA by December 31, 2014,
 23 28 to conduct a comprehensive review of the program and submit
 23 29 a report with specified information to the governor and the
 23 30 general assembly.
 23 31    The division modifies the purpose of the program to be
 23 32 to provide financial assistance to eligible entrepreneurial
 23 33 assistance providers (provider) that provide technical and
 23 34 financial assistance to entrepreneurs and start=up companies
 23 35 seeking to create, locate, or expand a business in Iowa.
 24  1 "Financial assistance" is defined in the division.
 24  2    The division changes the requirements for receiving an
 24  3 award.  To be eligible to receive an award under current
 24  4 law, an entrepreneurial assistance program must have been
 24  5 an Iowa=based business, expended at least $500,000 during
 24  6 the previous fiscal year to provide technical and financial
 24  7 assistance services that meet the broad=based needs of
 24  8 entrepreneurs seeking to create, locate, or expand a business
 24  9 in Iowa that intends to derive more than 10 percent of its
 24 10 gross sales from markets outside Iowa; and must have engaged
 24 11 and communicated with certain other programs, funding sources,
 24 12 and entities for its entrepreneur clients.  The division
 24 13 amends the eligibility for receiving financial assistance to
 24 14 require that a provider have its principal place of operations
 24 15 in Iowa and that the provider offer a comprehensive set of
 24 16 business development services to emerging and early=stage
 24 17 innovation companies to assist in the creation, location,
 24 18 growth, and long=term success of the company in Iowa.
 24 19 "Business development services" is defined in the division.
 24 20 Business development services may be performed at the physical
 24 21 location of the provider or the company and may be provided in
 24 22 consideration of equity participation in the company, a fee for
 24 23 services, or a membership agreement with the company.
 24 24    Under current law, the EDA board could approve, deny, or
 24 25 defer each application for a grant, and was required to award
 24 26 grants on a first=come, first=served basis.  The division
 24 27 specifies that the EDA board has the discretion to approve,
 24 28 deny, or defer each application for financial assistance and
 24 29 that the amount of financial assistance awarded to a provider
 24 30 is within the discretion of the EDA.  The division requires
 24 31 the EDA to award financial assistance on a competitive basis
 24 32 and allows the EDA to develop scoring criteria and establish
 24 33 minimum requirements for the receipt of a financial assistance
 24 34 award.
 24 35    In addition to the four factors relating to the provider's
 25  1 professional staff that the EDA may consider under current
 25  2 law in deciding whether to award financial assistance, the
 25  3 division provides that the EDA may also consider the service
 25  4 model and likelihood of success of the provider, the provider's
 25  5 similarity to other successful providers in the country, and
 25  6 the provider's financial need.
 25  7    The division modifies the maximum award amount for a
 25  8 recipient.  Under current law, a grant to an entrepreneur
 25  9 assistance program cannot exceed the lesser of 25 percent of
 25 10 the funds expended by the program during the previous fiscal
 25 11 year, 100 percent of the funds raised from certain persons
 25 12 by the program during the previous fiscal year, or $200,000.
 25 13 The division provides that the amount of financial assistance
 25 14 awarded to any one provider shall not exceed $200,000.
 25 15    The division modifies the permitted use of funds received
 25 16 under the program.  Under current law, grants are only
 25 17 permitted to be used for the purpose of operating costs
 25 18 incurred by the program.  The division specifies that financial
 25 19 assistance awarded to a provider shall only be used for
 25 20 the purpose of operating costs incurred by the provider in
 25 21 the provision of business development services to emerging
 25 22 and early=stage innovation companies in Iowa.  The division
 25 23 further requires that such financial assistance shall not be
 25 24 distributed to owners or investors of the company to which the
 25 25 business development services are being provided and shall not
 25 26 be provided to other persons assisting with the provision of
 25 27 the services.
 25 28    Under current law, an entrepreneurial assistance provider is
 25 29 required to accept client referrals from the EDA as a condition
 25 30 of receiving a grant.  The division provides that the EDA may
 25 31 make client referrals to eligible providers.
 25 32    DIVISION IV ==== MISCELLANEOUS CHANGES.  Division IV makes
 25 33 several miscellaneous changes to other EDA programs.  The
 25 34 division amends the sales and use tax refund available under
 25 35 the workforce housing tax incentive program.  That refund
 26  1 is available for sales and use tax paid prior to project
 26  2 completion, which is currently defined to mean the first date
 26  3 upon which the average annualized production of finished
 26  4 product for the preceding 90=day period at the manufacturing
 26  5 facility operated by the eligible business is at least 50
 26  6 percent of the initial design capacity of the facility.  The
 26  7 division amends the definition of "project completion" to mean
 26  8 the date on which the EDA notifies the department of revenue
 26  9 that all applicable requirements of a workforce housing tax
 26 10 incentive program agreement are satisfied.  This provision
 26 11 takes effect upon enactment and applies retroactively to July
 26 12 1, 2014, for all workforce housing tax incentive agreements
 26 13 entered into on or after that date.
 26 14    The division allows the EDA to extend the project
 26 15 completion date for a project awarded tax incentives under the
 26 16 redevelopment tax credit program and the housing enterprise
 26 17 zone tax incentives program if the property that is the subject
 26 18 of the project suffered a catastrophic fire during the 2014
 26 19 calendar year.

 18  7    Sec. 39.  RETROACTIVE APPLICABILITY.  The section of
 18  8 this division of this Act amending section 15.355 applies
 18  9 retroactively to July 1, 2014, for all agreements entered into
 18 10 pursuant to section 15.354 on or after that date.
 18 11                           EXPLANATION
 18 12 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
 18 13 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
 18 14    This bill relates to the administration of programs by the
 18 15 economic development authority (EDA) by creating a renewable
 18 16 chemical production tax credit, modifying the tax credit for
 18 17 investments in qualifying businesses and community=based seed
 18 18 capital funds, and modifying the entrepreneur investment awards
 18 19 program.
 18 20    DIVISION I ==== RENEWABLE CHEMICAL PRODUCTION TAX CREDIT.
 18 21   Division I creates a renewable chemical production tax credit
 18 22 program (program) that will be administered by the EDA and that
 18 23 will provide tax credits to eligible businesses that produce
 18 24 renewable chemicals in Iowa from biomass feedstock.  "Renewable
 18 25 chemical", "biomass feedstock", and other related terms are
 18 26 defined in the division.
 18 27    In order to qualify for the tax credit, a business must
 18 28 meet several requirements.  First, the business must be
 18 29 physically located in Iowa and operated for profit under
 18 30 single management.  Second, the business must not be an
 18 31 entity providing professional services, health care services,
 18 32 or medical treatments, or be engaged primarily in retail
 18 33 operations.  Third, the business must have organized, expanded,
 18 34 or located in Iowa on or after the effective date of the
 18 35 division.  Fourth, the business must not be, in the discretion
 19  1 of the EDA, ineligible under certain provisions relating to the
 19  2 relocation or reduction of business operations within Iowa.
 19  3 Fifth, the business must be in compliance with all agreements
 19  4 entered into under the program or other programs administered
 19  5 by the EDA.
 19  6    An eligible business seeking a tax credit is required
 19  7 to apply to the EDA during the calendar year following the
 19  8 calendar year in which the renewable chemicals are produced.
 19  9 The application must include the amount of renewable chemicals
 19 10 produced in Iowa from biomass feedstock by the eligible
 19 11 business during the calendar year, measured in pounds, and any
 19 12 other information reasonably required by the EDA in order to
 19 13 establish and verify eligibility under the program.  The EDA
 19 14 may accept applications on a continuous basis or may establish
 19 15 an annual application deadline.
 19 16    Before being issued a tax credit, an eligible business
 19 17 is required to enter into an agreement with the EDA for the
 19 18 successful completion of all requirements of the program.  The
 19 19 EDA is authorized to impose two compliance cost fees under the
 19 20 program.  The first fee equals $500 per agreement.  The second
 19 21 fee equals 0.5 percent of the value of the tax credit claimed
 19 22 pursuant to the agreement if the agreement has an aggregate tax
 19 23 credit value of $100,000 or greater.
 19 24    An eligible business that fails to comply with the
 19 25 requirements of the program or the terms of an agreement with
 19 26 the EDA may have its tax credits reduced, terminated, or
 19 27 rescinded, and may be subject to the repayment or recapture of
 19 28 claimed tax credits.
 19 29    Upon determining that all requirements of an agreement and
 19 30 the program have been fulfilled, the EDA shall issue a tax
 19 31 credit and related tax credit certificate to the eligible
 19 32 business in an amount equal to the product of $.05 multiplied
 19 33 by the number of pounds of renewable chemicals produced in Iowa
 19 34 from biomass feedstock by the eligible business during the
 19 35 calendar year.  Renewable chemicals produced by an eligible
 20  1 business prior to the effective date of the division, or
 20  2 prior to the date the business first qualifies as an eligible
 20  3 business, or after calendar year 2025, shall not qualify for
 20  4 the tax credit.
 20  5    The tax credit shall be claimed for the tax year during
 20  6 which the eligible business was issued the tax credit.  The tax
 20  7 credit may be claimed against the individual income tax and the
 20  8 corporate income tax.  The credit is refundable or may, at the
 20  9 election of the taxpayer, be carried forward for up to one tax
 20 10 year.   The tax credit shall not be transferred to any person.  A
 20 11 tax credit issued to a partnership, limited liability company,
 20 12 S corporation, cooperative organized under Code chapter 501
 20 13 and filing as a partnership for federal tax purposes, estate,
 20 14 or trust electing to have the income taxed directly to the
 20 15 individual may be claimed by the individual based upon the pro
 20 16 rata share of the individual's earnings from that entity.
 20 17    The division provides that the program is subject to the
 20 18 EDA's maximum aggregate tax credit cap of $170 million per
 20 19 fiscal year in Code section 15.119, and not more than $15
 20 20 million per fiscal year may be issued by the EDA under the
 20 21 program.  In addition, the maximum amount of tax credit that
 20 22 may be issued to an eligible business in any one calendar year
 20 23 shall not exceed $1 million or $500,000, depending on whether
 20 24 the eligible business has been operating in Iowa at the time of
 20 25 application for five or fewer years, or more than five years,
 20 26 respectively.  An eligible business shall not receive more than
 20 27 five tax credits under the program.  The EDA is required to
 20 28 issue tax credits on a first=come, first=served basis until the
 20 29 maximum amount of $15 million per fiscal year is reached.  If
 20 30 the amount of tax credits exceeds this amount in a fiscal year,
 20 31 the EDA is required to establish a wait list and give priority
 20 32 in subsequent years to the eligible businesses on the wait
 20 33 list.
 20 34    The division provides for the confidentiality of certain
 20 35 information under the program.  The identity of a tax credit
 21  1 recipient and the amount of the tax credit shall be considered
 21  2 public information under Code chapter 22 (examination of public
 21  3 records), but any other information or record in the possession
 21  4 of the EDA with respect to the program shall be presumed by
 21  5 the EDA to be a trade secret protected under Code chapter 550
 21  6 or common law and shall be kept confidential by the EDA unless
 21  7 otherwise ordered by a court.
 21  8    The division takes effect upon enactment and applies to
 21  9 renewable chemicals produced in Iowa from biomass feedstock on
 21 10 or after that date.  The division applies retroactively to tax
 21 11 years beginning on or after January 1, 2015.
 21 12    DIVISION II ==== ANGEL INVESTOR TAX CREDITS.   Division II
 21 13 makes several changes to the tax credit for investments in
 21 14 qualifying businesses and community=based seed capital funds,
 21 15 often referred to as the angel investor tax credits.  The
 21 16 division amends the purpose of the tax credit in Code section
 21 17 15E.41.  The division excludes investments in community=based
 21 18 seed capital funds from qualifying for the tax credit and
 21 19 makes several conforming amendments to remove references to
 21 20 community=based seed capital funds from the Code.
 21 21    The division modifies the amount and dollar limitation of
 21 22 the tax credit for a taxpayer.  The tax credit is increased
 21 23 from 20 percent to 25 percent of a taxpayer's equity investment
 21 24 in a qualifying business.  Under current law, a taxpayer cannot
 21 25 claim more than $50,000 of tax credit per investment in a
 21 26 qualifying business, and for each tax year a taxpayer and the
 21 27 taxpayer's affiliates cannot claim tax credits for more than
 21 28 five investments in five different qualifying businesses.  The
 21 29 division amends this dollar limitation to prohibit a natural
 21 30 person and the person's spouse, child, or sibling from claiming
 21 31 a combined amount of more than $100,000 in tax credits per tax
 21 32 year.
 21 33    The division also provides that no more than $500,000 in tax
 21 34 credits may be issued per tax year for equity investments in
 21 35 any one qualifying business.
 22  1 The division modifies the procedures for claiming the tax
 22  2 credit.  Under current law, the tax credit is not refundable
 22  3 but available for carryforward for up to five tax years.  The
 22  4 division makes the tax credit refundable for an investment
 22  5 made by a natural person, and for any other person reduces the
 22  6 carryforward period to three years.
 22  7    The division strikes a provision permitting the EDA
 22  8 to cooperate with small business development centers to
 22  9 disseminate information regarding the credits and to develop
 22 10 standard application forms, and requiring the EDA to distribute
 22 11 copies of the application forms to all community=based seed
 22 12 capital funds and potential individual investors.
 22 13    The division modifies the eligibility requirements for
 22 14 qualifying businesses.  The division strikes the requirement
 22 15 that a business have an owner that meets at least one of
 22 16 four qualifications relating to business education or
 22 17 business experience.  The division requires that a business
 22 18 be participating in an entrepreneurial assistance program,
 22 19 as defined in the division, but allows the EDA to waive this
 22 20 requirement if the business establishes that its owners,
 22 21 directors, officers, and employees have an appropriate level
 22 22 of experience such that an entrepreneurial assistance program
 22 23 would not materially change the prospects of the business.
 22 24 The EDA is allowed to consult with outside service providers
 22 25 in considering such a waiver.  The division increases from $5
 22 26 million to $10 million the maximum amount of net worth that
 22 27 a business may have to be considered a qualifying business.
 22 28 The division increases from $250,000 to $500,000 the amount of
 22 29 financing that a business must have in order to be considered a
 22 30 qualifying business, removes "near equity" from the types of
 22 31 financing that will be considered in that calculation, requires
 22 32 that the financing be secured at the time of application for
 22 33 the tax credits, and requires that the business have at least
 22 34 two investors at the time of application for the tax credits.
 22 35 These modified eligibility requirements apply to businesses
 23  1 that submit an application to the EDA to be registered as a
 23  2 qualifying business on or after the effective date of this
 23  3 division of the bill, and businesses that submitted such an
 23  4 application to the EDA before the effective date of this
 23  5 division of the bill shall be governed by current law.
 23  6    The division provides for the confidentiality of certain
 23  7 information with regard to the tax credit.  The identity of
 23  8 a qualifying business, the identity of an investor and the
 23  9 qualifying business in which the investor made an equity
 23 10 investment, and the total number and amount of tax credits
 23 11 issued shall be considered public information under Code
 23 12 chapter 22 (examination of public records), but any other
 23 13 information or record in the possession of the EDA with respect
 23 14 to the program shall be presumed by the EDA to be a trade secret
 23 15 protected under Code chapter 550 or common law and shall be
 23 16 kept confidential by the EDA unless otherwise ordered by a
 23 17 court.
 23 18    The division takes effect upon enactment and applies to
 23 19 equity investments in a qualifying business made on or after
 23 20 that date.  Equity investments in a qualifying business or
 23 21 community=based seed capital fund made prior to the effective
 23 22 date of the division shall be governed by current law.
 23 23    DIVISION III ==== ENTREPRENEUR INVESTMENT AWARDS PROGRAM.
 23 24  Division III amends the entrepreneur investment awards program
 23 25 administered by the EDA.  The division strikes provisions that
 23 26 prohibited the EDA from making awards under the program since
 23 27 July 1, 2014, and that required the EDA by December 31, 2014,
 23 28 to conduct a comprehensive review of the program and submit
 23 29 a report with specified information to the governor and the
 23 30 general assembly.
 23 31    The division modifies the purpose of the program to be
 23 32 to provide financial assistance to eligible entrepreneurial
 23 33 assistance providers (provider) that provide technical and
 23 34 financial assistance to entrepreneurs and start=up companies
 23 35 seeking to create, locate, or expand a business in Iowa.
 24  1 "Financial assistance" is defined in the division.
 24  2    The division changes the requirements for receiving an
 24  3 award.  To be eligible to receive an award under current
 24  4 law, an entrepreneurial assistance program must have been
 24  5 an Iowa=based business, expended at least $500,000 during
 24  6 the previous fiscal year to provide technical and financial
 24  7 assistance services that meet the broad=based needs of
 24  8 entrepreneurs seeking to create, locate, or expand a business
 24  9 in Iowa that intends to derive more than 10 percent of its
 24 10 gross sales from markets outside Iowa; and must have engaged
 24 11 and communicated with certain other programs, funding sources,
 24 12 and entities for its entrepreneur clients.  The division
 24 13 amends the eligibility for receiving financial assistance to
 24 14 require that a provider have its principal place of operations
 24 15 in Iowa and that the provider offer a comprehensive set of
 24 16 business development services to emerging and early=stage
 24 17 innovation companies to assist in the creation, location,
 24 18 growth, and long=term success of the company in Iowa.
 24 19 "Business development services" is defined in the division.
 24 20 Business development services may be performed at the physical
 24 21 location of the provider or the company and may be provided in
 24 22 consideration of equity participation in the company, a fee for
 24 23 services, or a membership agreement with the company.
 24 24    Under current law, the EDA board could approve, deny, or
 24 25 defer each application for a grant, and was required to award
 24 26 grants on a first=come, first=served basis.  The division
 24 27 specifies that the EDA board has the discretion to approve,
 24 28 deny, or defer each application for financial assistance and
 24 29 that the amount of financial assistance awarded to a provider
 24 30 is within the discretion of the EDA.  The division requires
 24 31 the EDA to award financial assistance on a competitive basis
 24 32 and allows the EDA to develop scoring criteria and establish
 24 33 minimum requirements for the receipt of a financial assistance
 24 34 award.
 24 35    In addition to the four factors relating to the provider's
 25  1 professional staff that the EDA may consider under current
 25  2 law in deciding whether to award financial assistance, the
 25  3 division provides that the EDA may also consider the service
 25  4 model and likelihood of success of the provider, the provider's
 25  5 similarity to other successful providers in the country, and
 25  6 the provider's financial need.
 25  7    The division modifies the maximum award amount for a
 25  8 recipient.  Under current law, a grant to an entrepreneur
 25  9 assistance program cannot exceed the lesser of 25 percent of
 25 10 the funds expended by the program during the previous fiscal
 25 11 year, 100 percent of the funds raised from certain persons
 25 12 by the program during the previous fiscal year, or $200,000.
 25 13 The division provides that the amount of financial assistance
 25 14 awarded to any one provider shall not exceed $200,000.
 25 15    The division modifies the permitted use of funds received
 25 16 under the program.  Under current law, grants are only
 25 17 permitted to be used for the purpose of operating costs
 25 18 incurred by the program.  The division specifies that financial
 25 19 assistance awarded to a provider shall only be used for
 25 20 the purpose of operating costs incurred by the provider in
 25 21 the provision of business development services to emerging
 25 22 and early=stage innovation companies in Iowa.  The division
 25 23 further requires that such financial assistance shall not be
 25 24 distributed to owners or investors of the company to which the
 25 25 business development services are being provided and shall not
 25 26 be provided to other persons assisting with the provision of
 25 27 the services.
 25 28    Under current law, an entrepreneurial assistance provider is
 25 29 required to accept client referrals from the EDA as a condition
 25 30 of receiving a grant.  The division provides that the EDA may
 25 31 make client referrals to eligible providers.
 25 32    DIVISION IV ==== MISCELLANEOUS CHANGES.  Division IV makes
 25 33 several miscellaneous changes to other EDA programs.  The
 25 34 division amends the sales and use tax refund available under
 25 35 the workforce housing tax incentive program.  That refund
 26  1 is available for sales and use tax paid prior to project
 26  2 completion, which is currently defined to mean the first date
 26  3 upon which the average annualized production of finished
 26  4 product for the preceding 90=day period at the manufacturing
 26  5 facility operated by the eligible business is at least 50
 26  6 percent of the initial design capacity of the facility.  The
 26  7 division amends the definition of "project completion" to mean
 26  8 the date on which the EDA notifies the department of revenue
 26  9 that all applicable requirements of a workforce housing tax
 26 10 incentive program agreement are satisfied.  This provision
 26 11 takes effect upon enactment and applies retroactively to July
 26 12 1, 2014, for all workforce housing tax incentive agreements
 26 13 entered into on or after that date.
 26 14    The division allows the EDA to extend the project
 26 15 completion date for a project awarded tax incentives under the
 26 16 redevelopment tax credit program and the housing enterprise
 26 17 zone tax incentives program if the property that is the subject
 26 18 of the project suffered a catastrophic fire during the 2014
 26 19 calendar year.

       mm/sc
 18  7    Sec. 39.  RETROACTIVE APPLICABILITY.  The section of
 18  8 this division of this Act amending section 15.355 applies
 18  9 retroactively to July 1, 2014, for all agreements entered into
 18 10 pursuant to section 15.354 on or after that date.
 18 11                           EXPLANATION
 18 12 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
 18 13 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
 18 14    This bill relates to the administration of programs by the
 18 15 economic development authority (EDA) by creating a renewable
 18 16 chemical production tax credit, modifying the tax credit for
 18 17 investments in qualifying businesses and community=based seed
 18 18 capital funds, and modifying the entrepreneur investment awards
 18 19 program.
 18 20    DIVISION I ==== RENEWABLE CHEMICAL PRODUCTION TAX CREDIT.
 18 21   Division I creates a renewable chemical production tax credit
 18 22 program (program) that will be administered by the EDA and that
 18 23 will provide tax credits to eligible businesses that produce
 18 24 renewable chemicals in Iowa from biomass feedstock.  "Renewable
 18 25 chemical", "biomass feedstock", and other related terms are
 18 26 defined in the division.
 18 27    In order to qualify for the tax credit, a business must
 18 28 meet several requirements.  First, the business must be
 18 29 physically located in Iowa and operated for profit under
 18 30 single management.  Second, the business must not be an
 18 31 entity providing professional services, health care services,
 18 32 or medical treatments, or be engaged primarily in retail
 18 33 operations.  Third, the business must have organized, expanded,
 18 34 or located in Iowa on or after the effective date of the
 18 35 division.  Fourth, the business must not be, in the discretion
 19  1 of the EDA, ineligible under certain provisions relating to the
 19  2 relocation or reduction of business operations within Iowa.
 19  3 Fifth, the business must be in compliance with all agreements
 19  4 entered into under the program or other programs administered
 19  5 by the EDA.
 19  6    An eligible business seeking a tax credit is required
 19  7 to apply to the EDA during the calendar year following the
 19  8 calendar year in which the renewable chemicals are produced.
 19  9 The application must include the amount of renewable chemicals
 19 10 produced in Iowa from biomass feedstock by the eligible
 19 11 business during the calendar year, measured in pounds, and any
 19 12 other information reasonably required by the EDA in order to
 19 13 establish and verify eligibility under the program.  The EDA
 19 14 may accept applications on a continuous basis or may establish
 19 15 an annual application deadline.
 19 16    Before being issued a tax credit, an eligible business
 19 17 is required to enter into an agreement with the EDA for the
 19 18 successful completion of all requirements of the program.  The
 19 19 EDA is authorized to impose two compliance cost fees under the
 19 20 program.  The first fee equals $500 per agreement.  The second
 19 21 fee equals 0.5 percent of the value of the tax credit claimed
 19 22 pursuant to the agreement if the agreement has an aggregate tax
 19 23 credit value of $100,000 or greater.
 19 24    An eligible business that fails to comply with the
 19 25 requirements of the program or the terms of an agreement with
 19 26 the EDA may have its tax credits reduced, terminated, or
 19 27 rescinded, and may be subject to the repayment or recapture of
 19 28 claimed tax credits.
 19 29    Upon determining that all requirements of an agreement and
 19 30 the program have been fulfilled, the EDA shall issue a tax
 19 31 credit and related tax credit certificate to the eligible
 19 32 business in an amount equal to the product of $.05 multiplied
 19 33 by the number of pounds of renewable chemicals produced in Iowa
 19 34 from biomass feedstock by the eligible business during the
 19 35 calendar year.  Renewable chemicals produced by an eligible
 20  1 business prior to the effective date of the division, or
 20  2 prior to the date the business first qualifies as an eligible
 20  3 business, or after calendar year 2025, shall not qualify for
 20  4 the tax credit.
 20  5    The tax credit shall be claimed for the tax year during
 20  6 which the eligible business was issued the tax credit.  The tax
 20  7 credit may be claimed against the individual income tax and the
 20  8 corporate income tax.  The credit is refundable or may, at the
 20  9 election of the taxpayer, be carried forward for up to one tax
 20 10 year.   The tax credit shall not be transferred to any person.  A
 20 11 tax credit issued to a partnership, limited liability company,
 20 12 S corporation, cooperative organized under Code chapter 501
 20 13 and filing as a partnership for federal tax purposes, estate,
 20 14 or trust electing to have the income taxed directly to the
 20 15 individual may be claimed by the individual based upon the pro
 20 16 rata share of the individual's earnings from that entity.
 20 17    The division provides that the program is subject to the
 20 18 EDA's maximum aggregate tax credit cap of $170 million per
 20 19 fiscal year in Code section 15.119, and not more than $15
 20 20 million per fiscal year may be issued by the EDA under the
 20 21 program.  In addition, the maximum amount of tax credit that
 20 22 may be issued to an eligible business in any one calendar year
 20 23 shall not exceed $1 million or $500,000, depending on whether
 20 24 the eligible business has been operating in Iowa at the time of
 20 25 application for five or fewer years, or more than five years,
 20 26 respectively.  An eligible business shall not receive more than
 20 27 five tax credits under the program.  The EDA is required to
 20 28 issue tax credits on a first=come, first=served basis until the
 20 29 maximum amount of $15 million per fiscal year is reached.  If
 20 30 the amount of tax credits exceeds this amount in a fiscal year,
 20 31 the EDA is required to establish a wait list and give priority
 20 32 in subsequent years to the eligible businesses on the wait
 20 33 list.
 20 34    The division provides for the confidentiality of certain
 20 35 information under the program.  The identity of a tax credit
 21  1 recipient and the amount of the tax credit shall be considered
 21  2 public information under Code chapter 22 (examination of public
 21  3 records), but any other information or record in the possession
 21  4 of the EDA with respect to the program shall be presumed by
 21  5 the EDA to be a trade secret protected under Code chapter 550
 21  6 or common law and shall be kept confidential by the EDA unless
 21  7 otherwise ordered by a court.
 21  8    The division takes effect upon enactment and applies to
 21  9 renewable chemicals produced in Iowa from biomass feedstock on
 21 10 or after that date.  The division applies retroactively to tax
 21 11 years beginning on or after January 1, 2015.
 21 12    DIVISION II ==== ANGEL INVESTOR TAX CREDITS.   Division II
 21 13 makes several changes to the tax credit for investments in
 21 14 qualifying businesses and community=based seed capital funds,
 21 15 often referred to as the angel investor tax credits.  The
 21 16 division amends the purpose of the tax credit in Code section
 21 17 15E.41.  The division excludes investments in community=based
 21 18 seed capital funds from qualifying for the tax credit and
 21 19 makes several conforming amendments to remove references to
 21 20 community=based seed capital funds from the Code.
 21 21    The division modifies the amount and dollar limitation of
 21 22 the tax credit for a taxpayer.  The tax credit is increased
 21 23 from 20 percent to 25 percent of a taxpayer's equity investment
 21 24 in a qualifying business.  Under current law, a taxpayer cannot
 21 25 claim more than $50,000 of tax credit per investment in a
 21 26 qualifying business, and for each tax year a taxpayer and the
 21 27 taxpayer's affiliates cannot claim tax credits for more than
 21 28 five investments in five different qualifying businesses.  The
 21 29 division amends this dollar limitation to prohibit a natural
 21 30 person and the person's spouse, child, or sibling from claiming
 21 31 a combined amount of more than $100,000 in tax credits per tax
 21 32 year.
 21 33    The division also provides that no more than $500,000 in tax
 21 34 credits may be issued per tax year for equity investments in
 21 35 any one qualifying business.
 22  1 The division modifies the procedures for claiming the tax
 22  2 credit.  Under current law, the tax credit is not refundable
 22  3 but available for carryforward for up to five tax years.  The
 22  4 division makes the tax credit refundable for an investment
 22  5 made by a natural person, and for any other person reduces the
 22  6 carryforward period to three years.
 22  7    The division strikes a provision permitting the EDA
 22  8 to cooperate with small business development centers to
 22  9 disseminate information regarding the credits and to develop
 22 10 standard application forms, and requiring the EDA to distribute
 22 11 copies of the application forms to all community=based seed
 22 12 capital funds and potential individual investors.
 22 13    The division modifies the eligibility requirements for
 22 14 qualifying businesses.  The division strikes the requirement
 22 15 that a business have an owner that meets at least one of
 22 16 four qualifications relating to business education or
 22 17 business experience.  The division requires that a business
 22 18 be participating in an entrepreneurial assistance program,
 22 19 as defined in the division, but allows the EDA to waive this
 22 20 requirement if the business establishes that its owners,
 22 21 directors, officers, and employees have an appropriate level
 22 22 of experience such that an entrepreneurial assistance program
 22 23 would not materially change the prospects of the business.
 22 24 The EDA is allowed to consult with outside service providers
 22 25 in considering such a waiver.  The division increases from $5
 22 26 million to $10 million the maximum amount of net worth that
 22 27 a business may have to be considered a qualifying business.
 22 28 The division increases from $250,000 to $500,000 the amount of
 22 29 financing that a business must have in order to be considered a
 22 30 qualifying business, removes "near equity" from the types of
 22 31 financing that will be considered in that calculation, requires
 22 32 that the financing be secured at the time of application for
 22 33 the tax credits, and requires that the business have at least
 22 34 two investors at the time of application for the tax credits.
 22 35 These modified eligibility requirements apply to businesses
 23  1 that submit an application to the EDA to be registered as a
 23  2 qualifying business on or after the effective date of this
 23  3 division of the bill, and businesses that submitted such an
 23  4 application to the EDA before the effective date of this
 23  5 division of the bill shall be governed by current law.
 23  6    The division provides for the confidentiality of certain
 23  7 information with regard to the tax credit.  The identity of
 23  8 a qualifying business, the identity of an investor and the
 23  9 qualifying business in which the investor made an equity
 23 10 investment, and the total number and amount of tax credits
 23 11 issued shall be considered public information under Code
 23 12 chapter 22 (examination of public records), but any other
 23 13 information or record in the possession of the EDA with respect
 23 14 to the program shall be presumed by the EDA to be a trade secret
 23 15 protected under Code chapter 550 or common law and shall be
 23 16 kept confidential by the EDA unless otherwise ordered by a
 23 17 court.
 23 18    The division takes effect upon enactment and applies to
 23 19 equity investments in a qualifying business made on or after
 23 20 that date.  Equity investments in a qualifying business or
 23 21 community=based seed capital fund made prior to the effective
 23 22 date of the division shall be governed by current law.
 23 23    DIVISION III ==== ENTREPRENEUR INVESTMENT AWARDS PROGRAM.
 23 24  Division III amends the entrepreneur investment awards program
 23 25 administered by the EDA.  The division strikes provisions that
 23 26 prohibited the EDA from making awards under the program since
 23 27 July 1, 2014, and that required the EDA by December 31, 2014,
 23 28 to conduct a comprehensive review of the program and submit
 23 29 a report with specified information to the governor and the
 23 30 general assembly.
 23 31    The division modifies the purpose of the program to be
 23 32 to provide financial assistance to eligible entrepreneurial
 23 33 assistance providers (provider) that provide technical and
 23 34 financial assistance to entrepreneurs and start=up companies
 23 35 seeking to create, locate, or expand a business in Iowa.
 24  1 "Financial assistance" is defined in the division.
 24  2    The division changes the requirements for receiving an
 24  3 award.  To be eligible to receive an award under current
 24  4 law, an entrepreneurial assistance program must have been
 24  5 an Iowa=based business, expended at least $500,000 during
 24  6 the previous fiscal year to provide technical and financial
 24  7 assistance services that meet the broad=based needs of
 24  8 entrepreneurs seeking to create, locate, or expand a business
 24  9 in Iowa that intends to derive more than 10 percent of its
 24 10 gross sales from markets outside Iowa; and must have engaged
 24 11 and communicated with certain other programs, funding sources,
 24 12 and entities for its entrepreneur clients.  The division
 24 13 amends the eligibility for receiving financial assistance to
 24 14 require that a provider have its principal place of operations
 24 15 in Iowa and that the provider offer a comprehensive set of
 24 16 business development services to emerging and early=stage
 24 17 innovation companies to assist in the creation, location,
 24 18 growth, and long=term success of the company in Iowa.
 24 19 "Business development services" is defined in the division.
 24 20 Business development services may be performed at the physical
 24 21 location of the provider or the company and may be provided in
 24 22 consideration of equity participation in the company, a fee for
 24 23 services, or a membership agreement with the company.
 24 24    Under current law, the EDA board could approve, deny, or
 24 25 defer each application for a grant, and was required to award
 24 26 grants on a first=come, first=served basis.  The division
 24 27 specifies that the EDA board has the discretion to approve,
 24 28 deny, or defer each application for financial assistance and
 24 29 that the amount of financial assistance awarded to a provider
 24 30 is within the discretion of the EDA.  The division requires
 24 31 the EDA to award financial assistance on a competitive basis
 24 32 and allows the EDA to develop scoring criteria and establish
 24 33 minimum requirements for the receipt of a financial assistance
 24 34 award.
 24 35    In addition to the four factors relating to the provider's
 25  1 professional staff that the EDA may consider under current
 25  2 law in deciding whether to award financial assistance, the
 25  3 division provides that the EDA may also consider the service
 25  4 model and likelihood of success of the provider, the provider's
 25  5 similarity to other successful providers in the country, and
 25  6 the provider's financial need.
 25  7    The division modifies the maximum award amount for a
 25  8 recipient.  Under current law, a grant to an entrepreneur
 25  9 assistance program cannot exceed the lesser of 25 percent of
 25 10 the funds expended by the program during the previous fiscal
 25 11 year, 100 percent of the funds raised from certain persons
 25 12 by the program during the previous fiscal year, or $200,000.
 25 13 The division provides that the amount of financial assistance
 25 14 awarded to any one provider shall not exceed $200,000.
 25 15    The division modifies the permitted use of funds received
 25 16 under the program.  Under current law, grants are only
 25 17 permitted to be used for the purpose of operating costs
 25 18 incurred by the program.  The division specifies that financial
 25 19 assistance awarded to a provider shall only be used for
 25 20 the purpose of operating costs incurred by the provider in
 25 21 the provision of business development services to emerging
 25 22 and early=stage innovation companies in Iowa.  The division
 25 23 further requires that such financial assistance shall not be
 25 24 distributed to owners or investors of the company to which the
 25 25 business development services are being provided and shall not
 25 26 be provided to other persons assisting with the provision of
 25 27 the services.
 25 28    Under current law, an entrepreneurial assistance provider is
 25 29 required to accept client referrals from the EDA as a condition
 25 30 of receiving a grant.  The division provides that the EDA may
 25 31 make client referrals to eligible providers.
 25 32    DIVISION IV ==== MISCELLANEOUS CHANGES.  Division IV makes
 25 33 several miscellaneous changes to other EDA programs.  The
 25 34 division amends the sales and use tax refund available under
 25 35 the workforce housing tax incentive program.  That refund
 26  1 is available for sales and use tax paid prior to project
 26  2 completion, which is currently defined to mean the first date
 26  3 upon which the average annualized production of finished
 26  4 product for the preceding 90=day period at the manufacturing
 26  5 facility operated by the eligible business is at least 50
 26  6 percent of the initial design capacity of the facility.  The
 26  7 division amends the definition of "project completion" to mean
 26  8 the date on which the EDA notifies the department of revenue
 26  9 that all applicable requirements of a workforce housing tax
 26 10 incentive program agreement are satisfied.  This provision
 26 11 takes effect upon enactment and applies retroactively to July
 26 12 1, 2014, for all workforce housing tax incentive agreements
 26 13 entered into on or after that date.
 26 14    The division allows the EDA to extend the project
 26 15 completion date for a project awarded tax incentives under the
 26 16 redevelopment tax credit program and the housing enterprise
 26 17 zone tax incentives program if the property that is the subject
 26 18 of the project suffered a catastrophic fire during the 2014
 26 19 calendar year.
       LSB 1212HV (3) 86
       mm/sc
 18  8 this division of this Act amending section 15.355 applies
 18  9 retroactively to July 1, 2014, for all agreements entered into
 18 10 pursuant to section 15.354 on or after that date.
 18 11                           EXPLANATION
 18 12 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
 18 13 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
 18 14    This bill relates to the administration of programs by the
 18 15 economic development authority (EDA) by creating a renewable
 18 16 chemical production tax credit, modifying the tax credit for
 18 17 investments in qualifying businesses and community=based seed
 18 18 capital funds, and modifying the entrepreneur investment awards
 18 19 program.
 18 20    DIVISION I ==== RENEWABLE CHEMICAL PRODUCTION TAX CREDIT.
 18 21   Division I creates a renewable chemical production tax credit
 18 22 program (program) that will be administered by the EDA and that
 18 23 will provide tax credits to eligible businesses that produce
 18 24 renewable chemicals in Iowa from biomass feedstock.  "Renewable
 18 25 chemical", "biomass feedstock", and other related terms are
 18 26 defined in the division.
 18 27    In order to qualify for the tax credit, a business must
 18 28 meet several requirements.  First, the business must be
 18 29 physically located in Iowa and operated for profit under
 18 30 single management.  Second, the business must not be an
 18 31 entity providing professional services, health care services,
 18 32 or medical treatments, or be engaged primarily in retail
 18 33 operations.  Third, the business must have organized, expanded,
 18 34 or located in Iowa on or after the effective date of the
 18 35 division.  Fourth, the business must not be, in the discretion
 19  1 of the EDA, ineligible under certain provisions relating to the
 19  2 relocation or reduction of business operations within Iowa.
 19  3 Fifth, the business must be in compliance with all agreements
 19  4 entered into under the program or other programs administered
 19  5 by the EDA.
 19  6    An eligible business seeking a tax credit is required
 19  7 to apply to the EDA during the calendar year following the
 19  8 calendar year in which the renewable chemicals are produced.
 19  9 The application must include the amount of renewable chemicals
 19 10 produced in Iowa from biomass feedstock by the eligible
 19 11 business during the calendar year, measured in pounds, and any
 19 12 other information reasonably required by the EDA in order to
 19 13 establish and verify eligibility under the program.  The EDA
 19 14 may accept applications on a continuous basis or may establish
 19 15 an annual application deadline.
 19 16    Before being issued a tax credit, an eligible business
 19 17 is required to enter into an agreement with the EDA for the
 19 18 successful completion of all requirements of the program.  The
 19 19 EDA is authorized to impose two compliance cost fees under the
 19 20 program.  The first fee equals $500 per agreement.  The second
 19 21 fee equals 0.5 percent of the value of the tax credit claimed
 19 22 pursuant to the agreement if the agreement has an aggregate tax
 19 23 credit value of $100,000 or greater.
 19 24    An eligible business that fails to comply with the
 19 25 requirements of the program or the terms of an agreement with
 19 26 the EDA may have its tax credits reduced, terminated, or
 19 27 rescinded, and may be subject to the repayment or recapture of
 19 28 claimed tax credits.
 19 29    Upon determining that all requirements of an agreement and
 19 30 the program have been fulfilled, the EDA shall issue a tax
 19 31 credit and related tax credit certificate to the eligible
 19 32 business in an amount equal to the product of $.05 multiplied
 19 33 by the number of pounds of renewable chemicals produced in Iowa
 19 34 from biomass feedstock by the eligible business during the
 19 35 calendar year.  Renewable chemicals produced by an eligible
 20  1 business prior to the effective date of the division, or
 20  2 prior to the date the business first qualifies as an eligible
 20  3 business, or after calendar year 2025, shall not qualify for
 20  4 the tax credit.
 20  5    The tax credit shall be claimed for the tax year during
 20  6 which the eligible business was issued the tax credit.  The tax
 20  7 credit may be claimed against the individual income tax and the
 20  8 corporate income tax.  The credit is refundable or may, at the
 20  9 election of the taxpayer, be carried forward for up to one tax
 20 10 year.   The tax credit shall not be transferred to any person.  A
 20 11 tax credit issued to a partnership, limited liability company,
 20 12 S corporation, cooperative organized under Code chapter 501
 20 13 and filing as a partnership for federal tax purposes, estate,
 20 14 or trust electing to have the income taxed directly to the
 20 15 individual may be claimed by the individual based upon the pro
 20 16 rata share of the individual's earnings from that entity.
 20 17    The division provides that the program is subject to the
 20 18 EDA's maximum aggregate tax credit cap of $170 million per
 20 19 fiscal year in Code section 15.119, and not more than $15
 20 20 million per fiscal year may be issued by the EDA under the
 20 21 program.  In addition, the maximum amount of tax credit that
 20 22 may be issued to an eligible business in any one calendar year
 20 23 shall not exceed $1 million or $500,000, depending on whether
 20 24 the eligible business has been operating in Iowa at the time of
 20 25 application for five or fewer years, or more than five years,
 20 26 respectively.  An eligible business shall not receive more than
 20 27 five tax credits under the program.  The EDA is required to
 20 28 issue tax credits on a first=come, first=served basis until the
 20 29 maximum amount of $15 million per fiscal year is reached.  If
 20 30 the amount of tax credits exceeds this amount in a fiscal year,
 20 31 the EDA is required to establish a wait list and give priority
 20 32 in subsequent years to the eligible businesses on the wait
 20 33 list.
 20 34    The division provides for the confidentiality of certain
 20 35 information under the program.  The identity of a tax credit
 21  1 recipient and the amount of the tax credit shall be considered
 21  2 public information under Code chapter 22 (examination of public
 21  3 records), but any other information or record in the possession
 21  4 of the EDA with respect to the program shall be presumed by
 21  5 the EDA to be a trade secret protected under Code chapter 550
 21  6 or common law and shall be kept confidential by the EDA unless
 21  7 otherwise ordered by a court.
 21  8    The division takes effect upon enactment and applies to
 21  9 renewable chemicals produced in Iowa from biomass feedstock on
 21 10 or after that date.  The division applies retroactively to tax
 21 11 years beginning on or after January 1, 2015.
 21 12    DIVISION II ==== ANGEL INVESTOR TAX CREDITS.   Division II
 21 13 makes several changes to the tax credit for investments in
 21 14 qualifying businesses and community=based seed capital funds,
 21 15 often referred to as the angel investor tax credits.  The
 21 16 division amends the purpose of the tax credit in Code section
 21 17 15E.41.  The division excludes investments in community=based
 21 18 seed capital funds from qualifying for the tax credit and
 21 19 makes several conforming amendments to remove references to
 21 20 community=based seed capital funds from the Code.
 21 21    The division modifies the amount and dollar limitation of
 21 22 the tax credit for a taxpayer.  The tax credit is increased
 21 23 from 20 percent to 25 percent of a taxpayer's equity investment
 21 24 in a qualifying business.  Under current law, a taxpayer cannot
 21 25 claim more than $50,000 of tax credit per investment in a
 21 26 qualifying business, and for each tax year a taxpayer and the
 21 27 taxpayer's affiliates cannot claim tax credits for more than
 21 28 five investments in five different qualifying businesses.  The
 21 29 division amends this dollar limitation to prohibit a natural
 21 30 person and the person's spouse, child, or sibling from claiming
 21 31 a combined amount of more than $100,000 in tax credits per tax
 21 32 year.
 21 33    The division also provides that no more than $500,000 in tax
 21 34 credits may be issued per tax year for equity investments in
 21 35 any one qualifying business.
 22  1 The division modifies the procedures for claiming the tax
 22  2 credit.  Under current law, the tax credit is not refundable
 22  3 but available for carryforward for up to five tax years.  The
 22  4 division makes the tax credit refundable for an investment
 22  5 made by a natural person, and for any other person reduces the
 22  6 carryforward period to three years.
 22  7    The division strikes a provision permitting the EDA
 22  8 to cooperate with small business development centers to
 22  9 disseminate information regarding the credits and to develop
 22 10 standard application forms, and requiring the EDA to distribute
 22 11 copies of the application forms to all community=based seed
 22 12 capital funds and potential individual investors.
 22 13    The division modifies the eligibility requirements for
 22 14 qualifying businesses.  The division strikes the requirement
 22 15 that a business have an owner that meets at least one of
 22 16 four qualifications relating to business education or
 22 17 business experience.  The division requires that a business
 22 18 be participating in an entrepreneurial assistance program,
 22 19 as defined in the division, but allows the EDA to waive this
 22 20 requirement if the business establishes that its owners,
 22 21 directors, officers, and employees have an appropriate level
 22 22 of experience such that an entrepreneurial assistance program
 22 23 would not materially change the prospects of the business.
 22 24 The EDA is allowed to consult with outside service providers
 22 25 in considering such a waiver.  The division increases from $5
 22 26 million to $10 million the maximum amount of net worth that
 22 27 a business may have to be considered a qualifying business.
 22 28 The division increases from $250,000 to $500,000 the amount of
 22 29 financing that a business must have in order to be considered a
 22 30 qualifying business, removes "near equity" from the types of
 22 31 financing that will be considered in that calculation, requires
 22 32 that the financing be secured at the time of application for
 22 33 the tax credits, and requires that the business have at least
 22 34 two investors at the time of application for the tax credits.
 22 35 These modified eligibility requirements apply to businesses
 23  1 that submit an application to the EDA to be registered as a
 23  2 qualifying business on or after the effective date of this
 23  3 division of the bill, and businesses that submitted such an
 23  4 application to the EDA before the effective date of this
 23  5 division of the bill shall be governed by current law.
 23  6    The division provides for the confidentiality of certain
 23  7 information with regard to the tax credit.  The identity of
 23  8 a qualifying business, the identity of an investor and the
 23  9 qualifying business in which the investor made an equity
 23 10 investment, and the total number and amount of tax credits
 23 11 issued shall be considered public information under Code
 23 12 chapter 22 (examination of public records), but any other
 23 13 information or record in the possession of the EDA with respect
 23 14 to the program shall be presumed by the EDA to be a trade secret
 23 15 protected under Code chapter 550 or common law and shall be
 23 16 kept confidential by the EDA unless otherwise ordered by a
 23 17 court.
 23 18    The division takes effect upon enactment and applies to
 23 19 equity investments in a qualifying business made on or after
 23 20 that date.  Equity investments in a qualifying business or
 23 21 community=based seed capital fund made prior to the effective
 23 22 date of the division shall be governed by current law.
 23 23    DIVISION III ==== ENTREPRENEUR INVESTMENT AWARDS PROGRAM.
 23 24  Division III amends the entrepreneur investment awards program
 23 25 administered by the EDA.  The division strikes provisions that
 23 26 prohibited the EDA from making awards under the program since
 23 27 July 1, 2014, and that required the EDA by December 31, 2014,
 23 28 to conduct a comprehensive review of the program and submit
 23 29 a report with specified information to the governor and the
 23 30 general assembly.
 23 31    The division modifies the purpose of the program to be
 23 32 to provide financial assistance to eligible entrepreneurial
 23 33 assistance providers (provider) that provide technical and
 23 34 financial assistance to entrepreneurs and start=up companies
 23 35 seeking to create, locate, or expand a business in Iowa.
 24  1 "Financial assistance" is defined in the division.
 24  2    The division changes the requirements for receiving an
 24  3 award.  To be eligible to receive an award under current
 24  4 law, an entrepreneurial assistance program must have been
 24  5 an Iowa=based business, expended at least $500,000 during
 24  6 the previous fiscal year to provide technical and financial
 24  7 assistance services that meet the broad=based needs of
 24  8 entrepreneurs seeking to create, locate, or expand a business
 24  9 in Iowa that intends to derive more than 10 percent of its
 24 10 gross sales from markets outside Iowa; and must have engaged
 24 11 and communicated with certain other programs, funding sources,
 24 12 and entities for its entrepreneur clients.  The division
 24 13 amends the eligibility for receiving financial assistance to
 24 14 require that a provider have its principal place of operations
 24 15 in Iowa and that the provider offer a comprehensive set of
 24 16 business development services to emerging and early=stage
 24 17 innovation companies to assist in the creation, location,
 24 18 growth, and long=term success of the company in Iowa.
 24 19 "Business development services" is defined in the division.
 24 20 Business development services may be performed at the physical
 24 21 location of the provider or the company and may be provided in
 24 22 consideration of equity participation in the company, a fee for
 24 23 services, or a membership agreement with the company.
 24 24    Under current law, the EDA board could approve, deny, or
 24 25 defer each application for a grant, and was required to award
 24 26 grants on a first=come, first=served basis.  The division
 24 27 specifies that the EDA board has the discretion to approve,
 24 28 deny, or defer each application for financial assistance and
 24 29 that the amount of financial assistance awarded to a provider
 24 30 is within the discretion of the EDA.  The division requires
 24 31 the EDA to award financial assistance on a competitive basis
 24 32 and allows the EDA to develop scoring criteria and establish
 24 33 minimum requirements for the receipt of a financial assistance
 24 34 award.
 24 35    In addition to the four factors relating to the provider's
 25  1 professional staff that the EDA may consider under current
 25  2 law in deciding whether to award financial assistance, the
 25  3 division provides that the EDA may also consider the service
 25  4 model and likelihood of success of the provider, the provider's
 25  5 similarity to other successful providers in the country, and
 25  6 the provider's financial need.
 25  7    The division modifies the maximum award amount for a
 25  8 recipient.  Under current law, a grant to an entrepreneur
 25  9 assistance program cannot exceed the lesser of 25 percent of
 25 10 the funds expended by the program during the previous fiscal
 25 11 year, 100 percent of the funds raised from certain persons
 25 12 by the program during the previous fiscal year, or $200,000.
 25 13 The division provides that the amount of financial assistance
 25 14 awarded to any one provider shall not exceed $200,000.
 25 15    The division modifies the permitted use of funds received
 25 16 under the program.  Under current law, grants are only
 25 17 permitted to be used for the purpose of operating costs
 25 18 incurred by the program.  The division specifies that financial
 25 19 assistance awarded to a provider shall only be used for
 25 20 the purpose of operating costs incurred by the provider in
 25 21 the provision of business development services to emerging
 25 22 and early=stage innovation companies in Iowa.  The division
 25 23 further requires that such financial assistance shall not be
 25 24 distributed to owners or investors of the company to which the
 25 25 business development services are being provided and shall not
 25 26 be provided to other persons assisting with the provision of
 25 27 the services.
 25 28    Under current law, an entrepreneurial assistance provider is
 25 29 required to accept client referrals from the EDA as a condition
 25 30 of receiving a grant.  The division provides that the EDA may
 25 31 make client referrals to eligible providers.
 25 32    DIVISION IV ==== MISCELLANEOUS CHANGES.  Division IV makes
 25 33 several miscellaneous changes to other EDA programs.  The
 25 34 division amends the sales and use tax refund available under
 25 35 the workforce housing tax incentive program.  That refund
 26  1 is available for sales and use tax paid prior to project
 26  2 completion, which is currently defined to mean the first date
 26  3 upon which the average annualized production of finished
 26  4 product for the preceding 90=day period at the manufacturing
 26  5 facility operated by the eligible business is at least 50
 26  6 percent of the initial design capacity of the facility.  The
 26  7 division amends the definition of "project completion" to mean
 26  8 the date on which the EDA notifies the department of revenue
 26  9 that all applicable requirements of a workforce housing tax
 26 10 incentive program agreement are satisfied.  This provision
 26 11 takes effect upon enactment and applies retroactively to July
 26 12 1, 2014, for all workforce housing tax incentive agreements
 26 13 entered into on or after that date.
 26 14    The division allows the EDA to extend the project
 26 15 completion date for a project awarded tax incentives under the
 26 16 redevelopment tax credit program and the housing enterprise
 26 17 zone tax incentives program if the property that is the subject
 26 18 of the project suffered a catastrophic fire during the 2014
 26 19 calendar year.
       LSB 1212HV (3) 86
       mm/sc
 18  9 retroactively to July 1, 2014, for all agreements entered into
 18 10 pursuant to section 15.354 on or after that date.
 18 11                           EXPLANATION
 18 12 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
 18 13 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
 18 14    This bill relates to the administration of programs by the
 18 15 economic development authority (EDA) by creating a renewable
 18 16 chemical production tax credit, modifying the tax credit for
 18 17 investments in qualifying businesses and community=based seed
 18 18 capital funds, and modifying the entrepreneur investment awards
 18 19 program.
 18 20    DIVISION I ==== RENEWABLE CHEMICAL PRODUCTION TAX CREDIT.
 18 21   Division I creates a renewable chemical production tax credit
 18 22 program (program) that will be administered by the EDA and that
 18 23 will provide tax credits to eligible businesses that produce
 18 24 renewable chemicals in Iowa from biomass feedstock.  "Renewable
 18 25 chemical", "biomass feedstock", and other related terms are
 18 26 defined in the division.
 18 27    In order to qualify for the tax credit, a business must
 18 28 meet several requirements.  First, the business must be
 18 29 physically located in Iowa and operated for profit under
 18 30 single management.  Second, the business must not be an
 18 31 entity providing professional services, health care services,
 18 32 or medical treatments, or be engaged primarily in retail
 18 33 operations.  Third, the business must have organized, expanded,
 18 34 or located in Iowa on or after the effective date of the
 18 35 division.  Fourth, the business must not be, in the discretion
 19  1 of the EDA, ineligible under certain provisions relating to the
 19  2 relocation or reduction of business operations within Iowa.
 19  3 Fifth, the business must be in compliance with all agreements
 19  4 entered into under the program or other programs administered
 19  5 by the EDA.
 19  6    An eligible business seeking a tax credit is required
 19  7 to apply to the EDA during the calendar year following the
 19  8 calendar year in which the renewable chemicals are produced.
 19  9 The application must include the amount of renewable chemicals
 19 10 produced in Iowa from biomass feedstock by the eligible
 19 11 business during the calendar year, measured in pounds, and any
 19 12 other information reasonably required by the EDA in order to
 19 13 establish and verify eligibility under the program.  The EDA
 19 14 may accept applications on a continuous basis or may establish
 19 15 an annual application deadline.
 19 16    Before being issued a tax credit, an eligible business
 19 17 is required to enter into an agreement with the EDA for the
 19 18 successful completion of all requirements of the program.  The
 19 19 EDA is authorized to impose two compliance cost fees under the
 19 20 program.  The first fee equals $500 per agreement.  The second
 19 21 fee equals 0.5 percent of the value of the tax credit claimed
 19 22 pursuant to the agreement if the agreement has an aggregate tax
 19 23 credit value of $100,000 or greater.
 19 24    An eligible business that fails to comply with the
 19 25 requirements of the program or the terms of an agreement with
 19 26 the EDA may have its tax credits reduced, terminated, or
 19 27 rescinded, and may be subject to the repayment or recapture of
 19 28 claimed tax credits.
 19 29    Upon determining that all requirements of an agreement and
 19 30 the program have been fulfilled, the EDA shall issue a tax
 19 31 credit and related tax credit certificate to the eligible
 19 32 business in an amount equal to the product of $.05 multiplied
 19 33 by the number of pounds of renewable chemicals produced in Iowa
 19 34 from biomass feedstock by the eligible business during the
 19 35 calendar year.  Renewable chemicals produced by an eligible
 20  1 business prior to the effective date of the division, or
 20  2 prior to the date the business first qualifies as an eligible
 20  3 business, or after calendar year 2025, shall not qualify for
 20  4 the tax credit.
 20  5    The tax credit shall be claimed for the tax year during
 20  6 which the eligible business was issued the tax credit.  The tax
 20  7 credit may be claimed against the individual income tax and the
 20  8 corporate income tax.  The credit is refundable or may, at the
 20  9 election of the taxpayer, be carried forward for up to one tax
 20 10 year.   The tax credit shall not be transferred to any person.  A
 20 11 tax credit issued to a partnership, limited liability company,
 20 12 S corporation, cooperative organized under Code chapter 501
 20 13 and filing as a partnership for federal tax purposes, estate,
 20 14 or trust electing to have the income taxed directly to the
 20 15 individual may be claimed by the individual based upon the pro
 20 16 rata share of the individual's earnings from that entity.
 20 17    The division provides that the program is subject to the
 20 18 EDA's maximum aggregate tax credit cap of $170 million per
 20 19 fiscal year in Code section 15.119, and not more than $15
 20 20 million per fiscal year may be issued by the EDA under the
 20 21 program.  In addition, the maximum amount of tax credit that
 20 22 may be issued to an eligible business in any one calendar year
 20 23 shall not exceed $1 million or $500,000, depending on whether
 20 24 the eligible business has been operating in Iowa at the time of
 20 25 application for five or fewer years, or more than five years,
 20 26 respectively.  An eligible business shall not receive more than
 20 27 five tax credits under the program.  The EDA is required to
 20 28 issue tax credits on a first=come, first=served basis until the
 20 29 maximum amount of $15 million per fiscal year is reached.  If
 20 30 the amount of tax credits exceeds this amount in a fiscal year,
 20 31 the EDA is required to establish a wait list and give priority
 20 32 in subsequent years to the eligible businesses on the wait
 20 33 list.
 20 34    The division provides for the confidentiality of certain
 20 35 information under the program.  The identity of a tax credit
 21  1 recipient and the amount of the tax credit shall be considered
 21  2 public information under Code chapter 22 (examination of public
 21  3 records), but any other information or record in the possession
 21  4 of the EDA with respect to the program shall be presumed by
 21  5 the EDA to be a trade secret protected under Code chapter 550
 21  6 or common law and shall be kept confidential by the EDA unless
 21  7 otherwise ordered by a court.
 21  8    The division takes effect upon enactment and applies to
 21  9 renewable chemicals produced in Iowa from biomass feedstock on
 21 10 or after that date.  The division applies retroactively to tax
 21 11 years beginning on or after January 1, 2015.
 21 12    DIVISION II ==== ANGEL INVESTOR TAX CREDITS.   Division II
 21 13 makes several changes to the tax credit for investments in
 21 14 qualifying businesses and community=based seed capital funds,
 21 15 often referred to as the angel investor tax credits.  The
 21 16 division amends the purpose of the tax credit in Code section
 21 17 15E.41.  The division excludes investments in community=based
 21 18 seed capital funds from qualifying for the tax credit and
 21 19 makes several conforming amendments to remove references to
 21 20 community=based seed capital funds from the Code.
 21 21    The division modifies the amount and dollar limitation of
 21 22 the tax credit for a taxpayer.  The tax credit is increased
 21 23 from 20 percent to 25 percent of a taxpayer's equity investment
 21 24 in a qualifying business.  Under current law, a taxpayer cannot
 21 25 claim more than $50,000 of tax credit per investment in a
 21 26 qualifying business, and for each tax year a taxpayer and the
 21 27 taxpayer's affiliates cannot claim tax credits for more than
 21 28 five investments in five different qualifying businesses.  The
 21 29 division amends this dollar limitation to prohibit a natural
 21 30 person and the person's spouse, child, or sibling from claiming
 21 31 a combined amount of more than $100,000 in tax credits per tax
 21 32 year.
 21 33    The division also provides that no more than $500,000 in tax
 21 34 credits may be issued per tax year for equity investments in
 21 35 any one qualifying business.
 22  1 The division modifies the procedures for claiming the tax
 22  2 credit.  Under current law, the tax credit is not refundable
 22  3 but available for carryforward for up to five tax years.  The
 22  4 division makes the tax credit refundable for an investment
 22  5 made by a natural person, and for any other person reduces the
 22  6 carryforward period to three years.
 22  7    The division strikes a provision permitting the EDA
 22  8 to cooperate with small business development centers to
 22  9 disseminate information regarding the credits and to develop
 22 10 standard application forms, and requiring the EDA to distribute
 22 11 copies of the application forms to all community=based seed
 22 12 capital funds and potential individual investors.
 22 13    The division modifies the eligibility requirements for
 22 14 qualifying businesses.  The division strikes the requirement
 22 15 that a business have an owner that meets at least one of
 22 16 four qualifications relating to business education or
 22 17 business experience.  The division requires that a business
 22 18 be participating in an entrepreneurial assistance program,
 22 19 as defined in the division, but allows the EDA to waive this
 22 20 requirement if the business establishes that its owners,
 22 21 directors, officers, and employees have an appropriate level
 22 22 of experience such that an entrepreneurial assistance program
 22 23 would not materially change the prospects of the business.
 22 24 The EDA is allowed to consult with outside service providers
 22 25 in considering such a waiver.  The division increases from $5
 22 26 million to $10 million the maximum amount of net worth that
 22 27 a business may have to be considered a qualifying business.
 22 28 The division increases from $250,000 to $500,000 the amount of
 22 29 financing that a business must have in order to be considered a
 22 30 qualifying business, removes "near equity" from the types of
 22 31 financing that will be considered in that calculation, requires
 22 32 that the financing be secured at the time of application for
 22 33 the tax credits, and requires that the business have at least
 22 34 two investors at the time of application for the tax credits.
 22 35 These modified eligibility requirements apply to businesses
 23  1 that submit an application to the EDA to be registered as a
 23  2 qualifying business on or after the effective date of this
 23  3 division of the bill, and businesses that submitted such an
 23  4 application to the EDA before the effective date of this
 23  5 division of the bill shall be governed by current law.
 23  6    The division provides for the confidentiality of certain
 23  7 information with regard to the tax credit.  The identity of
 23  8 a qualifying business, the identity of an investor and the
 23  9 qualifying business in which the investor made an equity
 23 10 investment, and the total number and amount of tax credits
 23 11 issued shall be considered public information under Code
 23 12 chapter 22 (examination of public records), but any other
 23 13 information or record in the possession of the EDA with respect
 23 14 to the program shall be presumed by the EDA to be a trade secret
 23 15 protected under Code chapter 550 or common law and shall be
 23 16 kept confidential by the EDA unless otherwise ordered by a
 23 17 court.
 23 18    The division takes effect upon enactment and applies to
 23 19 equity investments in a qualifying business made on or after
 23 20 that date.  Equity investments in a qualifying business or
 23 21 community=based seed capital fund made prior to the effective
 23 22 date of the division shall be governed by current law.
 23 23    DIVISION III ==== ENTREPRENEUR INVESTMENT AWARDS PROGRAM.
 23 24  Division III amends the entrepreneur investment awards program
 23 25 administered by the EDA.  The division strikes provisions that
 23 26 prohibited the EDA from making awards under the program since
 23 27 July 1, 2014, and that required the EDA by December 31, 2014,
 23 28 to conduct a comprehensive review of the program and submit
 23 29 a report with specified information to the governor and the
 23 30 general assembly.
 23 31    The division modifies the purpose of the program to be
 23 32 to provide financial assistance to eligible entrepreneurial
 23 33 assistance providers (provider) that provide technical and
 23 34 financial assistance to entrepreneurs and start=up companies
 23 35 seeking to create, locate, or expand a business in Iowa.
 24  1 "Financial assistance" is defined in the division.
 24  2    The division changes the requirements for receiving an
 24  3 award.  To be eligible to receive an award under current
 24  4 law, an entrepreneurial assistance program must have been
 24  5 an Iowa=based business, expended at least $500,000 during
 24  6 the previous fiscal year to provide technical and financial
 24  7 assistance services that meet the broad=based needs of
 24  8 entrepreneurs seeking to create, locate, or expand a business
 24  9 in Iowa that intends to derive more than 10 percent of its
 24 10 gross sales from markets outside Iowa; and must have engaged
 24 11 and communicated with certain other programs, funding sources,
 24 12 and entities for its entrepreneur clients.  The division
 24 13 amends the eligibility for receiving financial assistance to
 24 14 require that a provider have its principal place of operations
 24 15 in Iowa and that the provider offer a comprehensive set of
 24 16 business development services to emerging and early=stage
 24 17 innovation companies to assist in the creation, location,
 24 18 growth, and long=term success of the company in Iowa.
 24 19 "Business development services" is defined in the division.
 24 20 Business development services may be performed at the physical
 24 21 location of the provider or the company and may be provided in
 24 22 consideration of equity participation in the company, a fee for
 24 23 services, or a membership agreement with the company.
 24 24    Under current law, the EDA board could approve, deny, or
 24 25 defer each application for a grant, and was required to award
 24 26 grants on a first=come, first=served basis.  The division
 24 27 specifies that the EDA board has the discretion to approve,
 24 28 deny, or defer each application for financial assistance and
 24 29 that the amount of financial assistance awarded to a provider
 24 30 is within the discretion of the EDA.  The division requires
 24 31 the EDA to award financial assistance on a competitive basis
 24 32 and allows the EDA to develop scoring criteria and establish
 24 33 minimum requirements for the receipt of a financial assistance
 24 34 award.
 24 35    In addition to the four factors relating to the provider's
 25  1 professional staff that the EDA may consider under current
 25  2 law in deciding whether to award financial assistance, the
 25  3 division provides that the EDA may also consider the service
 25  4 model and likelihood of success of the provider, the provider's
 25  5 similarity to other successful providers in the country, and
 25  6 the provider's financial need.
 25  7    The division modifies the maximum award amount for a
 25  8 recipient.  Under current law, a grant to an entrepreneur
 25  9 assistance program cannot exceed the lesser of 25 percent of
 25 10 the funds expended by the program during the previous fiscal
 25 11 year, 100 percent of the funds raised from certain persons
 25 12 by the program during the previous fiscal year, or $200,000.
 25 13 The division provides that the amount of financial assistance
 25 14 awarded to any one provider shall not exceed $200,000.
 25 15    The division modifies the permitted use of funds received
 25 16 under the program.  Under current law, grants are only
 25 17 permitted to be used for the purpose of operating costs
 25 18 incurred by the program.  The division specifies that financial
 25 19 assistance awarded to a provider shall only be used for
 25 20 the purpose of operating costs incurred by the provider in
 25 21 the provision of business development services to emerging
 25 22 and early=stage innovation companies in Iowa.  The division
 25 23 further requires that such financial assistance shall not be
 25 24 distributed to owners or investors of the company to which the
 25 25 business development services are being provided and shall not
 25 26 be provided to other persons assisting with the provision of
 25 27 the services.
 25 28    Under current law, an entrepreneurial assistance provider is
 25 29 required to accept client referrals from the EDA as a condition
 25 30 of receiving a grant.  The division provides that the EDA may
 25 31 make client referrals to eligible providers.
 25 32    DIVISION IV ==== MISCELLANEOUS CHANGES.  Division IV makes
 25 33 several miscellaneous changes to other EDA programs.  The
 25 34 division amends the sales and use tax refund available under
 25 35 the workforce housing tax incentive program.  That refund
 26  1 is available for sales and use tax paid prior to project
 26  2 completion, which is currently defined to mean the first date
 26  3 upon which the average annualized production of finished
 26  4 product for the preceding 90=day period at the manufacturing
 26  5 facility operated by the eligible business is at least 50
 26  6 percent of the initial design capacity of the facility.  The
 26  7 division amends the definition of "project completion" to mean
 26  8 the date on which the EDA notifies the department of revenue
 26  9 that all applicable requirements of a workforce housing tax
 26 10 incentive program agreement are satisfied.  This provision
 26 11 takes effect upon enactment and applies retroactively to July
 26 12 1, 2014, for all workforce housing tax incentive agreements
 26 13 entered into on or after that date.
 26 14    The division allows the EDA to extend the project
 26 15 completion date for a project awarded tax incentives under the
 26 16 redevelopment tax credit program and the housing enterprise
 26 17 zone tax incentives program if the property that is the subject
 26 18 of the project suffered a catastrophic fire during the 2014
 26 19 calendar year.

 18 11                           EXPLANATION
 18 12 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
 18 13 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
 18 14    This bill relates to the administration of programs by the
 18 15 economic development authority (EDA) by creating a renewable
 18 16 chemical production tax credit, modifying the tax credit for
 18 17 investments in qualifying businesses and community=based seed
 18 18 capital funds, and modifying the entrepreneur investment awards
 18 19 program.
 18 20    DIVISION I ==== RENEWABLE CHEMICAL PRODUCTION TAX CREDIT.
 18 21   Division I creates a renewable chemical production tax credit
 18 22 program (program) that will be administered by the EDA and that
 18 23 will provide tax credits to eligible businesses that produce
 18 24 renewable chemicals in Iowa from biomass feedstock.  "Renewable
 18 25 chemical", "biomass feedstock", and other related terms are
 18 26 defined in the division.
 18 27    In order to qualify for the tax credit, a business must
 18 28 meet several requirements.  First, the business must be
 18 29 physically located in Iowa and operated for profit under
 18 30 single management.  Second, the business must not be an
 18 31 entity providing professional services, health care services,
 18 32 or medical treatments, or be engaged primarily in retail
 18 33 operations.  Third, the business must have organized, expanded,
 18 34 or located in Iowa on or after the effective date of the
 18 35 division.  Fourth, the business must not be, in the discretion
 19  1 of the EDA, ineligible under certain provisions relating to the
 19  2 relocation or reduction of business operations within Iowa.
 19  3 Fifth, the business must be in compliance with all agreements
 19  4 entered into under the program or other programs administered
 19  5 by the EDA.
 19  6    An eligible business seeking a tax credit is required
 19  7 to apply to the EDA during the calendar year following the
 19  8 calendar year in which the renewable chemicals are produced.
 19  9 The application must include the amount of renewable chemicals
 19 10 produced in Iowa from biomass feedstock by the eligible
 19 11 business during the calendar year, measured in pounds, and any
 19 12 other information reasonably required by the EDA in order to
 19 13 establish and verify eligibility under the program.  The EDA
 19 14 may accept applications on a continuous basis or may establish
 19 15 an annual application deadline.
 19 16    Before being issued a tax credit, an eligible business
 19 17 is required to enter into an agreement with the EDA for the
 19 18 successful completion of all requirements of the program.  The
 19 19 EDA is authorized to impose two compliance cost fees under the
 19 20 program.  The first fee equals $500 per agreement.  The second
 19 21 fee equals 0.5 percent of the value of the tax credit claimed
 19 22 pursuant to the agreement if the agreement has an aggregate tax
 19 23 credit value of $100,000 or greater.
 19 24    An eligible business that fails to comply with the
 19 25 requirements of the program or the terms of an agreement with
 19 26 the EDA may have its tax credits reduced, terminated, or
 19 27 rescinded, and may be subject to the repayment or recapture of
 19 28 claimed tax credits.
 19 29    Upon determining that all requirements of an agreement and
 19 30 the program have been fulfilled, the EDA shall issue a tax
 19 31 credit and related tax credit certificate to the eligible
 19 32 business in an amount equal to the product of $.05 multiplied
 19 33 by the number of pounds of renewable chemicals produced in Iowa
 19 34 from biomass feedstock by the eligible business during the
 19 35 calendar year.  Renewable chemicals produced by an eligible
 20  1 business prior to the effective date of the division, or
 20  2 prior to the date the business first qualifies as an eligible
 20  3 business, or after calendar year 2025, shall not qualify for
 20  4 the tax credit.
 20  5    The tax credit shall be claimed for the tax year during
 20  6 which the eligible business was issued the tax credit.  The tax
 20  7 credit may be claimed against the individual income tax and the
 20  8 corporate income tax.  The credit is refundable or may, at the
 20  9 election of the taxpayer, be carried forward for up to one tax
 20 10 year.   The tax credit shall not be transferred to any person.  A
 20 11 tax credit issued to a partnership, limited liability company,
 20 12 S corporation, cooperative organized under Code chapter 501
 20 13 and filing as a partnership for federal tax purposes, estate,
 20 14 or trust electing to have the income taxed directly to the
 20 15 individual may be claimed by the individual based upon the pro
 20 16 rata share of the individual's earnings from that entity.
 20 17    The division provides that the program is subject to the
 20 18 EDA's maximum aggregate tax credit cap of $170 million per
 20 19 fiscal year in Code section 15.119, and not more than $15
 20 20 million per fiscal year may be issued by the EDA under the
 20 21 program.  In addition, the maximum amount of tax credit that
 20 22 may be issued to an eligible business in any one calendar year
 20 23 shall not exceed $1 million or $500,000, depending on whether
 20 24 the eligible business has been operating in Iowa at the time of
 20 25 application for five or fewer years, or more than five years,
 20 26 respectively.  An eligible business shall not receive more than
 20 27 five tax credits under the program.  The EDA is required to
 20 28 issue tax credits on a first=come, first=served basis until the
 20 29 maximum amount of $15 million per fiscal year is reached.  If
 20 30 the amount of tax credits exceeds this amount in a fiscal year,
 20 31 the EDA is required to establish a wait list and give priority
 20 32 in subsequent years to the eligible businesses on the wait
 20 33 list.
 20 34    The division provides for the confidentiality of certain
 20 35 information under the program.  The identity of a tax credit
 21  1 recipient and the amount of the tax credit shall be considered
 21  2 public information under Code chapter 22 (examination of public
 21  3 records), but any other information or record in the possession
 21  4 of the EDA with respect to the program shall be presumed by
 21  5 the EDA to be a trade secret protected under Code chapter 550
 21  6 or common law and shall be kept confidential by the EDA unless
 21  7 otherwise ordered by a court.
 21  8    The division takes effect upon enactment and applies to
 21  9 renewable chemicals produced in Iowa from biomass feedstock on
 21 10 or after that date.  The division applies retroactively to tax
 21 11 years beginning on or after January 1, 2015.
 21 12    DIVISION II ==== ANGEL INVESTOR TAX CREDITS.   Division II
 21 13 makes several changes to the tax credit for investments in
 21 14 qualifying businesses and community=based seed capital funds,
 21 15 often referred to as the angel investor tax credits.  The
 21 16 division amends the purpose of the tax credit in Code section
 21 17 15E.41.  The division excludes investments in community=based
 21 18 seed capital funds from qualifying for the tax credit and
 21 19 makes several conforming amendments to remove references to
 21 20 community=based seed capital funds from the Code.
 21 21    The division modifies the amount and dollar limitation of
 21 22 the tax credit for a taxpayer.  The tax credit is increased
 21 23 from 20 percent to 25 percent of a taxpayer's equity investment
 21 24 in a qualifying business.  Under current law, a taxpayer cannot
 21 25 claim more than $50,000 of tax credit per investment in a
 21 26 qualifying business, and for each tax year a taxpayer and the
 21 27 taxpayer's affiliates cannot claim tax credits for more than
 21 28 five investments in five different qualifying businesses.  The
 21 29 division amends this dollar limitation to prohibit a natural
 21 30 person and the person's spouse, child, or sibling from claiming
 21 31 a combined amount of more than $100,000 in tax credits per tax
 21 32 year.
 21 33    The division also provides that no more than $500,000 in tax
 21 34 credits may be issued per tax year for equity investments in
 21 35 any one qualifying business.
 22  1 The division modifies the procedures for claiming the tax
 22  2 credit.  Under current law, the tax credit is not refundable
 22  3 but available for carryforward for up to five tax years.  The
 22  4 division makes the tax credit refundable for an investment
 22  5 made by a natural person, and for any other person reduces the
 22  6 carryforward period to three years.
 22  7    The division strikes a provision permitting the EDA
 22  8 to cooperate with small business development centers to
 22  9 disseminate information regarding the credits and to develop
 22 10 standard application forms, and requiring the EDA to distribute
 22 11 copies of the application forms to all community=based seed
 22 12 capital funds and potential individual investors.
 22 13    The division modifies the eligibility requirements for
 22 14 qualifying businesses.  The division strikes the requirement
 22 15 that a business have an owner that meets at least one of
 22 16 four qualifications relating to business education or
 22 17 business experience.  The division requires that a business
 22 18 be participating in an entrepreneurial assistance program,
 22 19 as defined in the division, but allows the EDA to waive this
 22 20 requirement if the business establishes that its owners,
 22 21 directors, officers, and employees have an appropriate level
 22 22 of experience such that an entrepreneurial assistance program
 22 23 would not materially change the prospects of the business.
 22 24 The EDA is allowed to consult with outside service providers
 22 25 in considering such a waiver.  The division increases from $5
 22 26 million to $10 million the maximum amount of net worth that
 22 27 a business may have to be considered a qualifying business.
 22 28 The division increases from $250,000 to $500,000 the amount of
 22 29 financing that a business must have in order to be considered a
 22 30 qualifying business, removes "near equity" from the types of
 22 31 financing that will be considered in that calculation, requires
 22 32 that the financing be secured at the time of application for
 22 33 the tax credits, and requires that the business have at least
 22 34 two investors at the time of application for the tax credits.
 22 35 These modified eligibility requirements apply to businesses
 23  1 that submit an application to the EDA to be registered as a
 23  2 qualifying business on or after the effective date of this
 23  3 division of the bill, and businesses that submitted such an
 23  4 application to the EDA before the effective date of this
 23  5 division of the bill shall be governed by current law.
 23  6    The division provides for the confidentiality of certain
 23  7 information with regard to the tax credit.  The identity of
 23  8 a qualifying business, the identity of an investor and the
 23  9 qualifying business in which the investor made an equity
 23 10 investment, and the total number and amount of tax credits
 23 11 issued shall be considered public information under Code
 23 12 chapter 22 (examination of public records), but any other
 23 13 information or record in the possession of the EDA with respect
 23 14 to the program shall be presumed by the EDA to be a trade secret
 23 15 protected under Code chapter 550 or common law and shall be
 23 16 kept confidential by the EDA unless otherwise ordered by a
 23 17 court.
 23 18    The division takes effect upon enactment and applies to
 23 19 equity investments in a qualifying business made on or after
 23 20 that date.  Equity investments in a qualifying business or
 23 21 community=based seed capital fund made prior to the effective
 23 22 date of the division shall be governed by current law.
 23 23    DIVISION III ==== ENTREPRENEUR INVESTMENT AWARDS PROGRAM.
 23 24  Division III amends the entrepreneur investment awards program
 23 25 administered by the EDA.  The division strikes provisions that
 23 26 prohibited the EDA from making awards under the program since
 23 27 July 1, 2014, and that required the EDA by December 31, 2014,
 23 28 to conduct a comprehensive review of the program and submit
 23 29 a report with specified information to the governor and the
 23 30 general assembly.
 23 31    The division modifies the purpose of the program to be
 23 32 to provide financial assistance to eligible entrepreneurial
 23 33 assistance providers (provider) that provide technical and
 23 34 financial assistance to entrepreneurs and start=up companies
 23 35 seeking to create, locate, or expand a business in Iowa.
 24  1 "Financial assistance" is defined in the division.
 24  2    The division changes the requirements for receiving an
 24  3 award.  To be eligible to receive an award under current
 24  4 law, an entrepreneurial assistance program must have been
 24  5 an Iowa=based business, expended at least $500,000 during
 24  6 the previous fiscal year to provide technical and financial
 24  7 assistance services that meet the broad=based needs of
 24  8 entrepreneurs seeking to create, locate, or expand a business
 24  9 in Iowa that intends to derive more than 10 percent of its
 24 10 gross sales from markets outside Iowa; and must have engaged
 24 11 and communicated with certain other programs, funding sources,
 24 12 and entities for its entrepreneur clients.  The division
 24 13 amends the eligibility for receiving financial assistance to
 24 14 require that a provider have its principal place of operations
 24 15 in Iowa and that the provider offer a comprehensive set of
 24 16 business development services to emerging and early=stage
 24 17 innovation companies to assist in the creation, location,
 24 18 growth, and long=term success of the company in Iowa.
 24 19 "Business development services" is defined in the division.
 24 20 Business development services may be performed at the physical
 24 21 location of the provider or the company and may be provided in
 24 22 consideration of equity participation in the company, a fee for
 24 23 services, or a membership agreement with the company.
 24 24    Under current law, the EDA board could approve, deny, or
 24 25 defer each application for a grant, and was required to award
 24 26 grants on a first=come, first=served basis.  The division
 24 27 specifies that the EDA board has the discretion to approve,
 24 28 deny, or defer each application for financial assistance and
 24 29 that the amount of financial assistance awarded to a provider
 24 30 is within the discretion of the EDA.  The division requires
 24 31 the EDA to award financial assistance on a competitive basis
 24 32 and allows the EDA to develop scoring criteria and establish
 24 33 minimum requirements for the receipt of a financial assistance
 24 34 award.
 24 35    In addition to the four factors relating to the provider's
 25  1 professional staff that the EDA may consider under current
 25  2 law in deciding whether to award financial assistance, the
 25  3 division provides that the EDA may also consider the service
 25  4 model and likelihood of success of the provider, the provider's
 25  5 similarity to other successful providers in the country, and
 25  6 the provider's financial need.
 25  7    The division modifies the maximum award amount for a
 25  8 recipient.  Under current law, a grant to an entrepreneur
 25  9 assistance program cannot exceed the lesser of 25 percent of
 25 10 the funds expended by the program during the previous fiscal
 25 11 year, 100 percent of the funds raised from certain persons
 25 12 by the program during the previous fiscal year, or $200,000.
 25 13 The division provides that the amount of financial assistance
 25 14 awarded to any one provider shall not exceed $200,000.
 25 15    The division modifies the permitted use of funds received
 25 16 under the program.  Under current law, grants are only
 25 17 permitted to be used for the purpose of operating costs
 25 18 incurred by the program.  The division specifies that financial
 25 19 assistance awarded to a provider shall only be used for
 25 20 the purpose of operating costs incurred by the provider in
 25 21 the provision of business development services to emerging
 25 22 and early=stage innovation companies in Iowa.  The division
 25 23 further requires that such financial assistance shall not be
 25 24 distributed to owners or investors of the company to which the
 25 25 business development services are being provided and shall not
 25 26 be provided to other persons assisting with the provision of
 25 27 the services.
 25 28    Under current law, an entrepreneurial assistance provider is
 25 29 required to accept client referrals from the EDA as a condition
 25 30 of receiving a grant.  The division provides that the EDA may
 25 31 make client referrals to eligible providers.
 25 32    DIVISION IV ==== MISCELLANEOUS CHANGES.  Division IV makes
 25 33 several miscellaneous changes to other EDA programs.  The
 25 34 division amends the sales and use tax refund available under
 25 35 the workforce housing tax incentive program.  That refund
 26  1 is available for sales and use tax paid prior to project
 26  2 completion, which is currently defined to mean the first date
 26  3 upon which the average annualized production of finished
 26  4 product for the preceding 90=day period at the manufacturing
 26  5 facility operated by the eligible business is at least 50
 26  6 percent of the initial design capacity of the facility.  The
 26  7 division amends the definition of "project completion" to mean
 26  8 the date on which the EDA notifies the department of revenue
 26  9 that all applicable requirements of a workforce housing tax
 26 10 incentive program agreement are satisfied.  This provision
 26 11 takes effect upon enactment and applies retroactively to July
 26 12 1, 2014, for all workforce housing tax incentive agreements
 26 13 entered into on or after that date.
 26 14    The division allows the EDA to extend the project
 26 15 completion date for a project awarded tax incentives under the
 26 16 redevelopment tax credit program and the housing enterprise
 26 17 zone tax incentives program if the property that is the subject
 26 18 of the project suffered a catastrophic fire during the 2014
 26 19 calendar year.

 18 11                           EXPLANATION
 18 12 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
 18 13 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
 18 14    This bill relates to the administration of programs by the
 18 15 economic development authority (EDA) by creating a renewable
 18 16 chemical production tax credit, modifying the tax credit for
 18 17 investments in qualifying businesses and community=based seed
 18 18 capital funds, and modifying the entrepreneur investment awards
 18 19 program.
 18 20    DIVISION I ==== RENEWABLE CHEMICAL PRODUCTION TAX CREDIT.
 18 21   Division I creates a renewable chemical production tax credit
 18 22 program (program) that will be administered by the EDA and that
 18 23 will provide tax credits to eligible businesses that produce
 18 24 renewable chemicals in Iowa from biomass feedstock.  "Renewable
 18 25 chemical", "biomass feedstock", and other related terms are
 18 26 defined in the division.
 18 27    In order to qualify for the tax credit, a business must
 18 28 meet several requirements.  First, the business must be
 18 29 physically located in Iowa and operated for profit under
 18 30 single management.  Second, the business must not be an
 18 31 entity providing professional services, health care services,
 18 32 or medical treatments, or be engaged primarily in retail
 18 33 operations.  Third, the business must have organized, expanded,
 18 34 or located in Iowa on or after the effective date of the
 18 35 division.  Fourth, the business must not be, in the discretion
 19  1 of the EDA, ineligible under certain provisions relating to the
 19  2 relocation or reduction of business operations within Iowa.
 19  3 Fifth, the business must be in compliance with all agreements
 19  4 entered into under the program or other programs administered
 19  5 by the EDA.
 19  6    An eligible business seeking a tax credit is required
 19  7 to apply to the EDA during the calendar year following the
 19  8 calendar year in which the renewable chemicals are produced.
 19  9 The application must include the amount of renewable chemicals
 19 10 produced in Iowa from biomass feedstock by the eligible
 19 11 business during the calendar year, measured in pounds, and any
 19 12 other information reasonably required by the EDA in order to
 19 13 establish and verify eligibility under the program.  The EDA
 19 14 may accept applications on a continuous basis or may establish
 19 15 an annual application deadline.
 19 16    Before being issued a tax credit, an eligible business
 19 17 is required to enter into an agreement with the EDA for the
 19 18 successful completion of all requirements of the program.  The
 19 19 EDA is authorized to impose two compliance cost fees under the
 19 20 program.  The first fee equals $500 per agreement.  The second
 19 21 fee equals 0.5 percent of the value of the tax credit claimed
 19 22 pursuant to the agreement if the agreement has an aggregate tax
 19 23 credit value of $100,000 or greater.
 19 24    An eligible business that fails to comply with the
 19 25 requirements of the program or the terms of an agreement with
 19 26 the EDA may have its tax credits reduced, terminated, or
 19 27 rescinded, and may be subject to the repayment or recapture of
 19 28 claimed tax credits.
 19 29    Upon determining that all requirements of an agreement and
 19 30 the program have been fulfilled, the EDA shall issue a tax
 19 31 credit and related tax credit certificate to the eligible
 19 32 business in an amount equal to the product of $.05 multiplied
 19 33 by the number of pounds of renewable chemicals produced in Iowa
 19 34 from biomass feedstock by the eligible business during the
 19 35 calendar year.  Renewable chemicals produced by an eligible
 20  1 business prior to the effective date of the division, or
 20  2 prior to the date the business first qualifies as an eligible
 20  3 business, or after calendar year 2025, shall not qualify for
 20  4 the tax credit.
 20  5    The tax credit shall be claimed for the tax year during
 20  6 which the eligible business was issued the tax credit.  The tax
 20  7 credit may be claimed against the individual income tax and the
 20  8 corporate income tax.  The credit is refundable or may, at the
 20  9 election of the taxpayer, be carried forward for up to one tax
 20 10 year.   The tax credit shall not be transferred to any person.  A
 20 11 tax credit issued to a partnership, limited liability company,
 20 12 S corporation, cooperative organized under Code chapter 501
 20 13 and filing as a partnership for federal tax purposes, estate,
 20 14 or trust electing to have the income taxed directly to the
 20 15 individual may be claimed by the individual based upon the pro
 20 16 rata share of the individual's earnings from that entity.
 20 17    The division provides that the program is subject to the
 20 18 EDA's maximum aggregate tax credit cap of $170 million per
 20 19 fiscal year in Code section 15.119, and not more than $15
 20 20 million per fiscal year may be issued by the EDA under the
 20 21 program.  In addition, the maximum amount of tax credit that
 20 22 may be issued to an eligible business in any one calendar year
 20 23 shall not exceed $1 million or $500,000, depending on whether
 20 24 the eligible business has been operating in Iowa at the time of
 20 25 application for five or fewer years, or more than five years,
 20 26 respectively.  An eligible business shall not receive more than
 20 27 five tax credits under the program.  The EDA is required to
 20 28 issue tax credits on a first=come, first=served basis until the
 20 29 maximum amount of $15 million per fiscal year is reached.  If
 20 30 the amount of tax credits exceeds this amount in a fiscal year,
 20 31 the EDA is required to establish a wait list and give priority
 20 32 in subsequent years to the eligible businesses on the wait
 20 33 list.
 20 34    The division provides for the confidentiality of certain
 20 35 information under the program.  The identity of a tax credit
 21  1 recipient and the amount of the tax credit shall be considered
 21  2 public information under Code chapter 22 (examination of public
 21  3 records), but any other information or record in the possession
 21  4 of the EDA with respect to the program shall be presumed by
 21  5 the EDA to be a trade secret protected under Code chapter 550
 21  6 or common law and shall be kept confidential by the EDA unless
 21  7 otherwise ordered by a court.
 21  8    The division takes effect upon enactment and applies to
 21  9 renewable chemicals produced in Iowa from biomass feedstock on
 21 10 or after that date.  The division applies retroactively to tax
 21 11 years beginning on or after January 1, 2015.
 21 12    DIVISION II ==== ANGEL INVESTOR TAX CREDITS.   Division II
 21 13 makes several changes to the tax credit for investments in
 21 14 qualifying businesses and community=based seed capital funds,
 21 15 often referred to as the angel investor tax credits.  The
 21 16 division amends the purpose of the tax credit in Code section
 21 17 15E.41.  The division excludes investments in community=based
 21 18 seed capital funds from qualifying for the tax credit and
 21 19 makes several conforming amendments to remove references to
 21 20 community=based seed capital funds from the Code.
 21 21    The division modifies the amount and dollar limitation of
 21 22 the tax credit for a taxpayer.  The tax credit is increased
 21 23 from 20 percent to 25 percent of a taxpayer's equity investment
 21 24 in a qualifying business.  Under current law, a taxpayer cannot
 21 25 claim more than $50,000 of tax credit per investment in a
 21 26 qualifying business, and for each tax year a taxpayer and the
 21 27 taxpayer's affiliates cannot claim tax credits for more than
 21 28 five investments in five different qualifying businesses.  The
 21 29 division amends this dollar limitation to prohibit a natural
 21 30 person and the person's spouse, child, or sibling from claiming
 21 31 a combined amount of more than $100,000 in tax credits per tax
 21 32 year.
 21 33    The division also provides that no more than $500,000 in tax
 21 34 credits may be issued per tax year for equity investments in
 21 35 any one qualifying business.
 22  1 The division modifies the procedures for claiming the tax
 22  2 credit.  Under current law, the tax credit is not refundable
 22  3 but available for carryforward for up to five tax years.  The
 22  4 division makes the tax credit refundable for an investment
 22  5 made by a natural person, and for any other person reduces the
 22  6 carryforward period to three years.
 22  7    The division strikes a provision permitting the EDA
 22  8 to cooperate with small business development centers to
 22  9 disseminate information regarding the credits and to develop
 22 10 standard application forms, and requiring the EDA to distribute
 22 11 copies of the application forms to all community=based seed
 22 12 capital funds and potential individual investors.
 22 13    The division modifies the eligibility requirements for
 22 14 qualifying businesses.  The division strikes the requirement
 22 15 that a business have an owner that meets at least one of
 22 16 four qualifications relating to business education or
 22 17 business experience.  The division requires that a business
 22 18 be participating in an entrepreneurial assistance program,
 22 19 as defined in the division, but allows the EDA to waive this
 22 20 requirement if the business establishes that its owners,
 22 21 directors, officers, and employees have an appropriate level
 22 22 of experience such that an entrepreneurial assistance program
 22 23 would not materially change the prospects of the business.
 22 24 The EDA is allowed to consult with outside service providers
 22 25 in considering such a waiver.  The division increases from $5
 22 26 million to $10 million the maximum amount of net worth that
 22 27 a business may have to be considered a qualifying business.
 22 28 The division increases from $250,000 to $500,000 the amount of
 22 29 financing that a business must have in order to be considered a
 22 30 qualifying business, removes "near equity" from the types of
 22 31 financing that will be considered in that calculation, requires
 22 32 that the financing be secured at the time of application for
 22 33 the tax credits, and requires that the business have at least
 22 34 two investors at the time of application for the tax credits.
 22 35 These modified eligibility requirements apply to businesses
 23  1 that submit an application to the EDA to be registered as a
 23  2 qualifying business on or after the effective date of this
 23  3 division of the bill, and businesses that submitted such an
 23  4 application to the EDA before the effective date of this
 23  5 division of the bill shall be governed by current law.
 23  6    The division provides for the confidentiality of certain
 23  7 information with regard to the tax credit.  The identity of
 23  8 a qualifying business, the identity of an investor and the
 23  9 qualifying business in which the investor made an equity
 23 10 investment, and the total number and amount of tax credits
 23 11 issued shall be considered public information under Code
 23 12 chapter 22 (examination of public records), but any other
 23 13 information or record in the possession of the EDA with respect
 23 14 to the program shall be presumed by the EDA to be a trade secret
 23 15 protected under Code chapter 550 or common law and shall be
 23 16 kept confidential by the EDA unless otherwise ordered by a
 23 17 court.
 23 18    The division takes effect upon enactment and applies to
 23 19 equity investments in a qualifying business made on or after
 23 20 that date.  Equity investments in a qualifying business or
 23 21 community=based seed capital fund made prior to the effective
 23 22 date of the division shall be governed by current law.
 23 23    DIVISION III ==== ENTREPRENEUR INVESTMENT AWARDS PROGRAM.
 23 24  Division III amends the entrepreneur investment awards program
 23 25 administered by the EDA.  The division strikes provisions that
 23 26 prohibited the EDA from making awards under the program since
 23 27 July 1, 2014, and that required the EDA by December 31, 2014,
 23 28 to conduct a comprehensive review of the program and submit
 23 29 a report with specified information to the governor and the
 23 30 general assembly.
 23 31    The division modifies the purpose of the program to be
 23 32 to provide financial assistance to eligible entrepreneurial
 23 33 assistance providers (provider) that provide technical and
 23 34 financial assistance to entrepreneurs and start=up companies
 23 35 seeking to create, locate, or expand a business in Iowa.
 24  1 "Financial assistance" is defined in the division.
 24  2    The division changes the requirements for receiving an
 24  3 award.  To be eligible to receive an award under current
 24  4 law, an entrepreneurial assistance program must have been
 24  5 an Iowa=based business, expended at least $500,000 during
 24  6 the previous fiscal year to provide technical and financial
 24  7 assistance services that meet the broad=based needs of
 24  8 entrepreneurs seeking to create, locate, or expand a business
 24  9 in Iowa that intends to derive more than 10 percent of its
 24 10 gross sales from markets outside Iowa; and must have engaged
 24 11 and communicated with certain other programs, funding sources,
 24 12 and entities for its entrepreneur clients.  The division
 24 13 amends the eligibility for receiving financial assistance to
 24 14 require that a provider have its principal place of operations
 24 15 in Iowa and that the provider offer a comprehensive set of
 24 16 business development services to emerging and early=stage
 24 17 innovation companies to assist in the creation, location,
 24 18 growth, and long=term success of the company in Iowa.
 24 19 "Business development services" is defined in the division.
 24 20 Business development services may be performed at the physical
 24 21 location of the provider or the company and may be provided in
 24 22 consideration of equity participation in the company, a fee for
 24 23 services, or a membership agreement with the company.
 24 24    Under current law, the EDA board could approve, deny, or
 24 25 defer each application for a grant, and was required to award
 24 26 grants on a first=come, first=served basis.  The division
 24 27 specifies that the EDA board has the discretion to approve,
 24 28 deny, or defer each application for financial assistance and
 24 29 that the amount of financial assistance awarded to a provider
 24 30 is within the discretion of the EDA.  The division requires
 24 31 the EDA to award financial assistance on a competitive basis
 24 32 and allows the EDA to develop scoring criteria and establish
 24 33 minimum requirements for the receipt of a financial assistance
 24 34 award.
 24 35    In addition to the four factors relating to the provider's
 25  1 professional staff that the EDA may consider under current
 25  2 law in deciding whether to award financial assistance, the
 25  3 division provides that the EDA may also consider the service
 25  4 model and likelihood of success of the provider, the provider's
 25  5 similarity to other successful providers in the country, and
 25  6 the provider's financial need.
 25  7    The division modifies the maximum award amount for a
 25  8 recipient.  Under current law, a grant to an entrepreneur
 25  9 assistance program cannot exceed the lesser of 25 percent of
 25 10 the funds expended by the program during the previous fiscal
 25 11 year, 100 percent of the funds raised from certain persons
 25 12 by the program during the previous fiscal year, or $200,000.
 25 13 The division provides that the amount of financial assistance
 25 14 awarded to any one provider shall not exceed $200,000.
 25 15    The division modifies the permitted use of funds received
 25 16 under the program.  Under current law, grants are only
 25 17 permitted to be used for the purpose of operating costs
 25 18 incurred by the program.  The division specifies that financial
 25 19 assistance awarded to a provider shall only be used for
 25 20 the purpose of operating costs incurred by the provider in
 25 21 the provision of business development services to emerging
 25 22 and early=stage innovation companies in Iowa.  The division
 25 23 further requires that such financial assistance shall not be
 25 24 distributed to owners or investors of the company to which the
 25 25 business development services are being provided and shall not
 25 26 be provided to other persons assisting with the provision of
 25 27 the services.
 25 28    Under current law, an entrepreneurial assistance provider is
 25 29 required to accept client referrals from the EDA as a condition
 25 30 of receiving a grant.  The division provides that the EDA may
 25 31 make client referrals to eligible providers.
 25 32    DIVISION IV ==== MISCELLANEOUS CHANGES.  Division IV makes
 25 33 several miscellaneous changes to other EDA programs.  The
 25 34 division amends the sales and use tax refund available under
 25 35 the workforce housing tax incentive program.  That refund
 26  1 is available for sales and use tax paid prior to project
 26  2 completion, which is currently defined to mean the first date
 26  3 upon which the average annualized production of finished
 26  4 product for the preceding 90=day period at the manufacturing
 26  5 facility operated by the eligible business is at least 50
 26  6 percent of the initial design capacity of the facility.  The
 26  7 division amends the definition of "project completion" to mean
 26  8 the date on which the EDA notifies the department of revenue
 26  9 that all applicable requirements of a workforce housing tax
 26 10 incentive program agreement are satisfied.  This provision
 26 11 takes effect upon enactment and applies retroactively to July
 26 12 1, 2014, for all workforce housing tax incentive agreements
 26 13 entered into on or after that date.
 26 14    The division allows the EDA to extend the project
 26 15 completion date for a project awarded tax incentives under the
 26 16 redevelopment tax credit program and the housing enterprise
 26 17 zone tax incentives program if the property that is the subject
 26 18 of the project suffered a catastrophic fire during the 2014
 26 19 calendar year.

       mm/sc
 18 12 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
 18 13 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
 18 14    This bill relates to the administration of programs by the
 18 15 economic development authority (EDA) by creating a renewable
 18 16 chemical production tax credit, modifying the tax credit for
 18 17 investments in qualifying businesses and community=based seed
 18 18 capital funds, and modifying the entrepreneur investment awards
 18 19 program.
 18 20    DIVISION I ==== RENEWABLE CHEMICAL PRODUCTION TAX CREDIT.
 18 21   Division I creates a renewable chemical production tax credit
 18 22 program (program) that will be administered by the EDA and that
 18 23 will provide tax credits to eligible businesses that produce
 18 24 renewable chemicals in Iowa from biomass feedstock.  "Renewable
 18 25 chemical", "biomass feedstock", and other related terms are
 18 26 defined in the division.
 18 27    In order to qualify for the tax credit, a business must
 18 28 meet several requirements.  First, the business must be
 18 29 physically located in Iowa and operated for profit under
 18 30 single management.  Second, the business must not be an
 18 31 entity providing professional services, health care services,
 18 32 or medical treatments, or be engaged primarily in retail
 18 33 operations.  Third, the business must have organized, expanded,
 18 34 or located in Iowa on or after the effective date of the
 18 35 division.  Fourth, the business must not be, in the discretion
 19  1 of the EDA, ineligible under certain provisions relating to the
 19  2 relocation or reduction of business operations within Iowa.
 19  3 Fifth, the business must be in compliance with all agreements
 19  4 entered into under the program or other programs administered
 19  5 by the EDA.
 19  6    An eligible business seeking a tax credit is required
 19  7 to apply to the EDA during the calendar year following the
 19  8 calendar year in which the renewable chemicals are produced.
 19  9 The application must include the amount of renewable chemicals
 19 10 produced in Iowa from biomass feedstock by the eligible
 19 11 business during the calendar year, measured in pounds, and any
 19 12 other information reasonably required by the EDA in order to
 19 13 establish and verify eligibility under the program.  The EDA
 19 14 may accept applications on a continuous basis or may establish
 19 15 an annual application deadline.
 19 16    Before being issued a tax credit, an eligible business
 19 17 is required to enter into an agreement with the EDA for the
 19 18 successful completion of all requirements of the program.  The
 19 19 EDA is authorized to impose two compliance cost fees under the
 19 20 program.  The first fee equals $500 per agreement.  The second
 19 21 fee equals 0.5 percent of the value of the tax credit claimed
 19 22 pursuant to the agreement if the agreement has an aggregate tax
 19 23 credit value of $100,000 or greater.
 19 24    An eligible business that fails to comply with the
 19 25 requirements of the program or the terms of an agreement with
 19 26 the EDA may have its tax credits reduced, terminated, or
 19 27 rescinded, and may be subject to the repayment or recapture of
 19 28 claimed tax credits.
 19 29    Upon determining that all requirements of an agreement and
 19 30 the program have been fulfilled, the EDA shall issue a tax
 19 31 credit and related tax credit certificate to the eligible
 19 32 business in an amount equal to the product of $.05 multiplied
 19 33 by the number of pounds of renewable chemicals produced in Iowa
 19 34 from biomass feedstock by the eligible business during the
 19 35 calendar year.  Renewable chemicals produced by an eligible
 20  1 business prior to the effective date of the division, or
 20  2 prior to the date the business first qualifies as an eligible
 20  3 business, or after calendar year 2025, shall not qualify for
 20  4 the tax credit.
 20  5    The tax credit shall be claimed for the tax year during
 20  6 which the eligible business was issued the tax credit.  The tax
 20  7 credit may be claimed against the individual income tax and the
 20  8 corporate income tax.  The credit is refundable or may, at the
 20  9 election of the taxpayer, be carried forward for up to one tax
 20 10 year.   The tax credit shall not be transferred to any person.  A
 20 11 tax credit issued to a partnership, limited liability company,
 20 12 S corporation, cooperative organized under Code chapter 501
 20 13 and filing as a partnership for federal tax purposes, estate,
 20 14 or trust electing to have the income taxed directly to the
 20 15 individual may be claimed by the individual based upon the pro
 20 16 rata share of the individual's earnings from that entity.
 20 17    The division provides that the program is subject to the
 20 18 EDA's maximum aggregate tax credit cap of $170 million per
 20 19 fiscal year in Code section 15.119, and not more than $15
 20 20 million per fiscal year may be issued by the EDA under the
 20 21 program.  In addition, the maximum amount of tax credit that
 20 22 may be issued to an eligible business in any one calendar year
 20 23 shall not exceed $1 million or $500,000, depending on whether
 20 24 the eligible business has been operating in Iowa at the time of
 20 25 application for five or fewer years, or more than five years,
 20 26 respectively.  An eligible business shall not receive more than
 20 27 five tax credits under the program.  The EDA is required to
 20 28 issue tax credits on a first=come, first=served basis until the
 20 29 maximum amount of $15 million per fiscal year is reached.  If
 20 30 the amount of tax credits exceeds this amount in a fiscal year,
 20 31 the EDA is required to establish a wait list and give priority
 20 32 in subsequent years to the eligible businesses on the wait
 20 33 list.
 20 34    The division provides for the confidentiality of certain
 20 35 information under the program.  The identity of a tax credit
 21  1 recipient and the amount of the tax credit shall be considered
 21  2 public information under Code chapter 22 (examination of public
 21  3 records), but any other information or record in the possession
 21  4 of the EDA with respect to the program shall be presumed by
 21  5 the EDA to be a trade secret protected under Code chapter 550
 21  6 or common law and shall be kept confidential by the EDA unless
 21  7 otherwise ordered by a court.
 21  8    The division takes effect upon enactment and applies to
 21  9 renewable chemicals produced in Iowa from biomass feedstock on
 21 10 or after that date.  The division applies retroactively to tax
 21 11 years beginning on or after January 1, 2015.
 21 12    DIVISION II ==== ANGEL INVESTOR TAX CREDITS.   Division II
 21 13 makes several changes to the tax credit for investments in
 21 14 qualifying businesses and community=based seed capital funds,
 21 15 often referred to as the angel investor tax credits.  The
 21 16 division amends the purpose of the tax credit in Code section
 21 17 15E.41.  The division excludes investments in community=based
 21 18 seed capital funds from qualifying for the tax credit and
 21 19 makes several conforming amendments to remove references to
 21 20 community=based seed capital funds from the Code.
 21 21    The division modifies the amount and dollar limitation of
 21 22 the tax credit for a taxpayer.  The tax credit is increased
 21 23 from 20 percent to 25 percent of a taxpayer's equity investment
 21 24 in a qualifying business.  Under current law, a taxpayer cannot
 21 25 claim more than $50,000 of tax credit per investment in a
 21 26 qualifying business, and for each tax year a taxpayer and the
 21 27 taxpayer's affiliates cannot claim tax credits for more than
 21 28 five investments in five different qualifying businesses.  The
 21 29 division amends this dollar limitation to prohibit a natural
 21 30 person and the person's spouse, child, or sibling from claiming
 21 31 a combined amount of more than $100,000 in tax credits per tax
 21 32 year.
 21 33    The division also provides that no more than $500,000 in tax
 21 34 credits may be issued per tax year for equity investments in
 21 35 any one qualifying business.
 22  1 The division modifies the procedures for claiming the tax
 22  2 credit.  Under current law, the tax credit is not refundable
 22  3 but available for carryforward for up to five tax years.  The
 22  4 division makes the tax credit refundable for an investment
 22  5 made by a natural person, and for any other person reduces the
 22  6 carryforward period to three years.
 22  7    The division strikes a provision permitting the EDA
 22  8 to cooperate with small business development centers to
 22  9 disseminate information regarding the credits and to develop
 22 10 standard application forms, and requiring the EDA to distribute
 22 11 copies of the application forms to all community=based seed
 22 12 capital funds and potential individual investors.
 22 13    The division modifies the eligibility requirements for
 22 14 qualifying businesses.  The division strikes the requirement
 22 15 that a business have an owner that meets at least one of
 22 16 four qualifications relating to business education or
 22 17 business experience.  The division requires that a business
 22 18 be participating in an entrepreneurial assistance program,
 22 19 as defined in the division, but allows the EDA to waive this
 22 20 requirement if the business establishes that its owners,
 22 21 directors, officers, and employees have an appropriate level
 22 22 of experience such that an entrepreneurial assistance program
 22 23 would not materially change the prospects of the business.
 22 24 The EDA is allowed to consult with outside service providers
 22 25 in considering such a waiver.  The division increases from $5
 22 26 million to $10 million the maximum amount of net worth that
 22 27 a business may have to be considered a qualifying business.
 22 28 The division increases from $250,000 to $500,000 the amount of
 22 29 financing that a business must have in order to be considered a
 22 30 qualifying business, removes "near equity" from the types of
 22 31 financing that will be considered in that calculation, requires
 22 32 that the financing be secured at the time of application for
 22 33 the tax credits, and requires that the business have at least
 22 34 two investors at the time of application for the tax credits.
 22 35 These modified eligibility requirements apply to businesses
 23  1 that submit an application to the EDA to be registered as a
 23  2 qualifying business on or after the effective date of this
 23  3 division of the bill, and businesses that submitted such an
 23  4 application to the EDA before the effective date of this
 23  5 division of the bill shall be governed by current law.
 23  6    The division provides for the confidentiality of certain
 23  7 information with regard to the tax credit.  The identity of
 23  8 a qualifying business, the identity of an investor and the
 23  9 qualifying business in which the investor made an equity
 23 10 investment, and the total number and amount of tax credits
 23 11 issued shall be considered public information under Code
 23 12 chapter 22 (examination of public records), but any other
 23 13 information or record in the possession of the EDA with respect
 23 14 to the program shall be presumed by the EDA to be a trade secret
 23 15 protected under Code chapter 550 or common law and shall be
 23 16 kept confidential by the EDA unless otherwise ordered by a
 23 17 court.
 23 18    The division takes effect upon enactment and applies to
 23 19 equity investments in a qualifying business made on or after
 23 20 that date.  Equity investments in a qualifying business or
 23 21 community=based seed capital fund made prior to the effective
 23 22 date of the division shall be governed by current law.
 23 23    DIVISION III ==== ENTREPRENEUR INVESTMENT AWARDS PROGRAM.
 23 24  Division III amends the entrepreneur investment awards program
 23 25 administered by the EDA.  The division strikes provisions that
 23 26 prohibited the EDA from making awards under the program since
 23 27 July 1, 2014, and that required the EDA by December 31, 2014,
 23 28 to conduct a comprehensive review of the program and submit
 23 29 a report with specified information to the governor and the
 23 30 general assembly.
 23 31    The division modifies the purpose of the program to be
 23 32 to provide financial assistance to eligible entrepreneurial
 23 33 assistance providers (provider) that provide technical and
 23 34 financial assistance to entrepreneurs and start=up companies
 23 35 seeking to create, locate, or expand a business in Iowa.
 24  1 "Financial assistance" is defined in the division.
 24  2    The division changes the requirements for receiving an
 24  3 award.  To be eligible to receive an award under current
 24  4 law, an entrepreneurial assistance program must have been
 24  5 an Iowa=based business, expended at least $500,000 during
 24  6 the previous fiscal year to provide technical and financial
 24  7 assistance services that meet the broad=based needs of
 24  8 entrepreneurs seeking to create, locate, or expand a business
 24  9 in Iowa that intends to derive more than 10 percent of its
 24 10 gross sales from markets outside Iowa; and must have engaged
 24 11 and communicated with certain other programs, funding sources,
 24 12 and entities for its entrepreneur clients.  The division
 24 13 amends the eligibility for receiving financial assistance to
 24 14 require that a provider have its principal place of operations
 24 15 in Iowa and that the provider offer a comprehensive set of
 24 16 business development services to emerging and early=stage
 24 17 innovation companies to assist in the creation, location,
 24 18 growth, and long=term success of the company in Iowa.
 24 19 "Business development services" is defined in the division.
 24 20 Business development services may be performed at the physical
 24 21 location of the provider or the company and may be provided in
 24 22 consideration of equity participation in the company, a fee for
 24 23 services, or a membership agreement with the company.
 24 24    Under current law, the EDA board could approve, deny, or
 24 25 defer each application for a grant, and was required to award
 24 26 grants on a first=come, first=served basis.  The division
 24 27 specifies that the EDA board has the discretion to approve,
 24 28 deny, or defer each application for financial assistance and
 24 29 that the amount of financial assistance awarded to a provider
 24 30 is within the discretion of the EDA.  The division requires
 24 31 the EDA to award financial assistance on a competitive basis
 24 32 and allows the EDA to develop scoring criteria and establish
 24 33 minimum requirements for the receipt of a financial assistance
 24 34 award.
 24 35    In addition to the four factors relating to the provider's
 25  1 professional staff that the EDA may consider under current
 25  2 law in deciding whether to award financial assistance, the
 25  3 division provides that the EDA may also consider the service
 25  4 model and likelihood of success of the provider, the provider's
 25  5 similarity to other successful providers in the country, and
 25  6 the provider's financial need.
 25  7    The division modifies the maximum award amount for a
 25  8 recipient.  Under current law, a grant to an entrepreneur
 25  9 assistance program cannot exceed the lesser of 25 percent of
 25 10 the funds expended by the program during the previous fiscal
 25 11 year, 100 percent of the funds raised from certain persons
 25 12 by the program during the previous fiscal year, or $200,000.
 25 13 The division provides that the amount of financial assistance
 25 14 awarded to any one provider shall not exceed $200,000.
 25 15    The division modifies the permitted use of funds received
 25 16 under the program.  Under current law, grants are only
 25 17 permitted to be used for the purpose of operating costs
 25 18 incurred by the program.  The division specifies that financial
 25 19 assistance awarded to a provider shall only be used for
 25 20 the purpose of operating costs incurred by the provider in
 25 21 the provision of business development services to emerging
 25 22 and early=stage innovation companies in Iowa.  The division
 25 23 further requires that such financial assistance shall not be
 25 24 distributed to owners or investors of the company to which the
 25 25 business development services are being provided and shall not
 25 26 be provided to other persons assisting with the provision of
 25 27 the services.
 25 28    Under current law, an entrepreneurial assistance provider is
 25 29 required to accept client referrals from the EDA as a condition
 25 30 of receiving a grant.  The division provides that the EDA may
 25 31 make client referrals to eligible providers.
 25 32    DIVISION IV ==== MISCELLANEOUS CHANGES.  Division IV makes
 25 33 several miscellaneous changes to other EDA programs.  The
 25 34 division amends the sales and use tax refund available under
 25 35 the workforce housing tax incentive program.  That refund
 26  1 is available for sales and use tax paid prior to project
 26  2 completion, which is currently defined to mean the first date
 26  3 upon which the average annualized production of finished
 26  4 product for the preceding 90=day period at the manufacturing
 26  5 facility operated by the eligible business is at least 50
 26  6 percent of the initial design capacity of the facility.  The
 26  7 division amends the definition of "project completion" to mean
 26  8 the date on which the EDA notifies the department of revenue
 26  9 that all applicable requirements of a workforce housing tax
 26 10 incentive program agreement are satisfied.  This provision
 26 11 takes effect upon enactment and applies retroactively to July
 26 12 1, 2014, for all workforce housing tax incentive agreements
 26 13 entered into on or after that date.
 26 14    The division allows the EDA to extend the project
 26 15 completion date for a project awarded tax incentives under the
 26 16 redevelopment tax credit program and the housing enterprise
 26 17 zone tax incentives program if the property that is the subject
 26 18 of the project suffered a catastrophic fire during the 2014
 26 19 calendar year.
       LSB 1212HV (3) 86
       mm/sc
 18 13 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
 18 14    This bill relates to the administration of programs by the
 18 15 economic development authority (EDA) by creating a renewable
 18 16 chemical production tax credit, modifying the tax credit for
 18 17 investments in qualifying businesses and community=based seed
 18 18 capital funds, and modifying the entrepreneur investment awards
 18 19 program.
 18 20    DIVISION I ==== RENEWABLE CHEMICAL PRODUCTION TAX CREDIT.
 18 21   Division I creates a renewable chemical production tax credit
 18 22 program (program) that will be administered by the EDA and that
 18 23 will provide tax credits to eligible businesses that produce
 18 24 renewable chemicals in Iowa from biomass feedstock.  "Renewable
 18 25 chemical", "biomass feedstock", and other related terms are
 18 26 defined in the division.
 18 27    In order to qualify for the tax credit, a business must
 18 28 meet several requirements.  First, the business must be
 18 29 physically located in Iowa and operated for profit under
 18 30 single management.  Second, the business must not be an
 18 31 entity providing professional services, health care services,
 18 32 or medical treatments, or be engaged primarily in retail
 18 33 operations.  Third, the business must have organized, expanded,
 18 34 or located in Iowa on or after the effective date of the
 18 35 division.  Fourth, the business must not be, in the discretion
 19  1 of the EDA, ineligible under certain provisions relating to the
 19  2 relocation or reduction of business operations within Iowa.
 19  3 Fifth, the business must be in compliance with all agreements
 19  4 entered into under the program or other programs administered
 19  5 by the EDA.
 19  6    An eligible business seeking a tax credit is required
 19  7 to apply to the EDA during the calendar year following the
 19  8 calendar year in which the renewable chemicals are produced.
 19  9 The application must include the amount of renewable chemicals
 19 10 produced in Iowa from biomass feedstock by the eligible
 19 11 business during the calendar year, measured in pounds, and any
 19 12 other information reasonably required by the EDA in order to
 19 13 establish and verify eligibility under the program.  The EDA
 19 14 may accept applications on a continuous basis or may establish
 19 15 an annual application deadline.
 19 16    Before being issued a tax credit, an eligible business
 19 17 is required to enter into an agreement with the EDA for the
 19 18 successful completion of all requirements of the program.  The
 19 19 EDA is authorized to impose two compliance cost fees under the
 19 20 program.  The first fee equals $500 per agreement.  The second
 19 21 fee equals 0.5 percent of the value of the tax credit claimed
 19 22 pursuant to the agreement if the agreement has an aggregate tax
 19 23 credit value of $100,000 or greater.
 19 24    An eligible business that fails to comply with the
 19 25 requirements of the program or the terms of an agreement with
 19 26 the EDA may have its tax credits reduced, terminated, or
 19 27 rescinded, and may be subject to the repayment or recapture of
 19 28 claimed tax credits.
 19 29    Upon determining that all requirements of an agreement and
 19 30 the program have been fulfilled, the EDA shall issue a tax
 19 31 credit and related tax credit certificate to the eligible
 19 32 business in an amount equal to the product of $.05 multiplied
 19 33 by the number of pounds of renewable chemicals produced in Iowa
 19 34 from biomass feedstock by the eligible business during the
 19 35 calendar year.  Renewable chemicals produced by an eligible
 20  1 business prior to the effective date of the division, or
 20  2 prior to the date the business first qualifies as an eligible
 20  3 business, or after calendar year 2025, shall not qualify for
 20  4 the tax credit.
 20  5    The tax credit shall be claimed for the tax year during
 20  6 which the eligible business was issued the tax credit.  The tax
 20  7 credit may be claimed against the individual income tax and the
 20  8 corporate income tax.  The credit is refundable or may, at the
 20  9 election of the taxpayer, be carried forward for up to one tax
 20 10 year.   The tax credit shall not be transferred to any person.  A
 20 11 tax credit issued to a partnership, limited liability company,
 20 12 S corporation, cooperative organized under Code chapter 501
 20 13 and filing as a partnership for federal tax purposes, estate,
 20 14 or trust electing to have the income taxed directly to the
 20 15 individual may be claimed by the individual based upon the pro
 20 16 rata share of the individual's earnings from that entity.
 20 17    The division provides that the program is subject to the
 20 18 EDA's maximum aggregate tax credit cap of $170 million per
 20 19 fiscal year in Code section 15.119, and not more than $15
 20 20 million per fiscal year may be issued by the EDA under the
 20 21 program.  In addition, the maximum amount of tax credit that
 20 22 may be issued to an eligible business in any one calendar year
 20 23 shall not exceed $1 million or $500,000, depending on whether
 20 24 the eligible business has been operating in Iowa at the time of
 20 25 application for five or fewer years, or more than five years,
 20 26 respectively.  An eligible business shall not receive more than
 20 27 five tax credits under the program.  The EDA is required to
 20 28 issue tax credits on a first=come, first=served basis until the
 20 29 maximum amount of $15 million per fiscal year is reached.  If
 20 30 the amount of tax credits exceeds this amount in a fiscal year,
 20 31 the EDA is required to establish a wait list and give priority
 20 32 in subsequent years to the eligible businesses on the wait
 20 33 list.
 20 34    The division provides for the confidentiality of certain
 20 35 information under the program.  The identity of a tax credit
 21  1 recipient and the amount of the tax credit shall be considered
 21  2 public information under Code chapter 22 (examination of public
 21  3 records), but any other information or record in the possession
 21  4 of the EDA with respect to the program shall be presumed by
 21  5 the EDA to be a trade secret protected under Code chapter 550
 21  6 or common law and shall be kept confidential by the EDA unless
 21  7 otherwise ordered by a court.
 21  8    The division takes effect upon enactment and applies to
 21  9 renewable chemicals produced in Iowa from biomass feedstock on
 21 10 or after that date.  The division applies retroactively to tax
 21 11 years beginning on or after January 1, 2015.
 21 12    DIVISION II ==== ANGEL INVESTOR TAX CREDITS.   Division II
 21 13 makes several changes to the tax credit for investments in
 21 14 qualifying businesses and community=based seed capital funds,
 21 15 often referred to as the angel investor tax credits.  The
 21 16 division amends the purpose of the tax credit in Code section
 21 17 15E.41.  The division excludes investments in community=based
 21 18 seed capital funds from qualifying for the tax credit and
 21 19 makes several conforming amendments to remove references to
 21 20 community=based seed capital funds from the Code.
 21 21    The division modifies the amount and dollar limitation of
 21 22 the tax credit for a taxpayer.  The tax credit is increased
 21 23 from 20 percent to 25 percent of a taxpayer's equity investment
 21 24 in a qualifying business.  Under current law, a taxpayer cannot
 21 25 claim more than $50,000 of tax credit per investment in a
 21 26 qualifying business, and for each tax year a taxpayer and the
 21 27 taxpayer's affiliates cannot claim tax credits for more than
 21 28 five investments in five different qualifying businesses.  The
 21 29 division amends this dollar limitation to prohibit a natural
 21 30 person and the person's spouse, child, or sibling from claiming
 21 31 a combined amount of more than $100,000 in tax credits per tax
 21 32 year.
 21 33    The division also provides that no more than $500,000 in tax
 21 34 credits may be issued per tax year for equity investments in
 21 35 any one qualifying business.
 22  1 The division modifies the procedures for claiming the tax
 22  2 credit.  Under current law, the tax credit is not refundable
 22  3 but available for carryforward for up to five tax years.  The
 22  4 division makes the tax credit refundable for an investment
 22  5 made by a natural person, and for any other person reduces the
 22  6 carryforward period to three years.
 22  7    The division strikes a provision permitting the EDA
 22  8 to cooperate with small business development centers to
 22  9 disseminate information regarding the credits and to develop
 22 10 standard application forms, and requiring the EDA to distribute
 22 11 copies of the application forms to all community=based seed
 22 12 capital funds and potential individual investors.
 22 13    The division modifies the eligibility requirements for
 22 14 qualifying businesses.  The division strikes the requirement
 22 15 that a business have an owner that meets at least one of
 22 16 four qualifications relating to business education or
 22 17 business experience.  The division requires that a business
 22 18 be participating in an entrepreneurial assistance program,
 22 19 as defined in the division, but allows the EDA to waive this
 22 20 requirement if the business establishes that its owners,
 22 21 directors, officers, and employees have an appropriate level
 22 22 of experience such that an entrepreneurial assistance program
 22 23 would not materially change the prospects of the business.
 22 24 The EDA is allowed to consult with outside service providers
 22 25 in considering such a waiver.  The division increases from $5
 22 26 million to $10 million the maximum amount of net worth that
 22 27 a business may have to be considered a qualifying business.
 22 28 The division increases from $250,000 to $500,000 the amount of
 22 29 financing that a business must have in order to be considered a
 22 30 qualifying business, removes "near equity" from the types of
 22 31 financing that will be considered in that calculation, requires
 22 32 that the financing be secured at the time of application for
 22 33 the tax credits, and requires that the business have at least
 22 34 two investors at the time of application for the tax credits.
 22 35 These modified eligibility requirements apply to businesses
 23  1 that submit an application to the EDA to be registered as a
 23  2 qualifying business on or after the effective date of this
 23  3 division of the bill, and businesses that submitted such an
 23  4 application to the EDA before the effective date of this
 23  5 division of the bill shall be governed by current law.
 23  6    The division provides for the confidentiality of certain
 23  7 information with regard to the tax credit.  The identity of
 23  8 a qualifying business, the identity of an investor and the
 23  9 qualifying business in which the investor made an equity
 23 10 investment, and the total number and amount of tax credits
 23 11 issued shall be considered public information under Code
 23 12 chapter 22 (examination of public records), but any other
 23 13 information or record in the possession of the EDA with respect
 23 14 to the program shall be presumed by the EDA to be a trade secret
 23 15 protected under Code chapter 550 or common law and shall be
 23 16 kept confidential by the EDA unless otherwise ordered by a
 23 17 court.
 23 18    The division takes effect upon enactment and applies to
 23 19 equity investments in a qualifying business made on or after
 23 20 that date.  Equity investments in a qualifying business or
 23 21 community=based seed capital fund made prior to the effective
 23 22 date of the division shall be governed by current law.
 23 23    DIVISION III ==== ENTREPRENEUR INVESTMENT AWARDS PROGRAM.
 23 24  Division III amends the entrepreneur investment awards program
 23 25 administered by the EDA.  The division strikes provisions that
 23 26 prohibited the EDA from making awards under the program since
 23 27 July 1, 2014, and that required the EDA by December 31, 2014,
 23 28 to conduct a comprehensive review of the program and submit
 23 29 a report with specified information to the governor and the
 23 30 general assembly.
 23 31    The division modifies the purpose of the program to be
 23 32 to provide financial assistance to eligible entrepreneurial
 23 33 assistance providers (provider) that provide technical and
 23 34 financial assistance to entrepreneurs and start=up companies
 23 35 seeking to create, locate, or expand a business in Iowa.
 24  1 "Financial assistance" is defined in the division.
 24  2    The division changes the requirements for receiving an
 24  3 award.  To be eligible to receive an award under current
 24  4 law, an entrepreneurial assistance program must have been
 24  5 an Iowa=based business, expended at least $500,000 during
 24  6 the previous fiscal year to provide technical and financial
 24  7 assistance services that meet the broad=based needs of
 24  8 entrepreneurs seeking to create, locate, or expand a business
 24  9 in Iowa that intends to derive more than 10 percent of its
 24 10 gross sales from markets outside Iowa; and must have engaged
 24 11 and communicated with certain other programs, funding sources,
 24 12 and entities for its entrepreneur clients.  The division
 24 13 amends the eligibility for receiving financial assistance to
 24 14 require that a provider have its principal place of operations
 24 15 in Iowa and that the provider offer a comprehensive set of
 24 16 business development services to emerging and early=stage
 24 17 innovation companies to assist in the creation, location,
 24 18 growth, and long=term success of the company in Iowa.
 24 19 "Business development services" is defined in the division.
 24 20 Business development services may be performed at the physical
 24 21 location of the provider or the company and may be provided in
 24 22 consideration of equity participation in the company, a fee for
 24 23 services, or a membership agreement with the company.
 24 24    Under current law, the EDA board could approve, deny, or
 24 25 defer each application for a grant, and was required to award
 24 26 grants on a first=come, first=served basis.  The division
 24 27 specifies that the EDA board has the discretion to approve,
 24 28 deny, or defer each application for financial assistance and
 24 29 that the amount of financial assistance awarded to a provider
 24 30 is within the discretion of the EDA.  The division requires
 24 31 the EDA to award financial assistance on a competitive basis
 24 32 and allows the EDA to develop scoring criteria and establish
 24 33 minimum requirements for the receipt of a financial assistance
 24 34 award.
 24 35    In addition to the four factors relating to the provider's
 25  1 professional staff that the EDA may consider under current
 25  2 law in deciding whether to award financial assistance, the
 25  3 division provides that the EDA may also consider the service
 25  4 model and likelihood of success of the provider, the provider's
 25  5 similarity to other successful providers in the country, and
 25  6 the provider's financial need.
 25  7    The division modifies the maximum award amount for a
 25  8 recipient.  Under current law, a grant to an entrepreneur
 25  9 assistance program cannot exceed the lesser of 25 percent of
 25 10 the funds expended by the program during the previous fiscal
 25 11 year, 100 percent of the funds raised from certain persons
 25 12 by the program during the previous fiscal year, or $200,000.
 25 13 The division provides that the amount of financial assistance
 25 14 awarded to any one provider shall not exceed $200,000.
 25 15    The division modifies the permitted use of funds received
 25 16 under the program.  Under current law, grants are only
 25 17 permitted to be used for the purpose of operating costs
 25 18 incurred by the program.  The division specifies that financial
 25 19 assistance awarded to a provider shall only be used for
 25 20 the purpose of operating costs incurred by the provider in
 25 21 the provision of business development services to emerging
 25 22 and early=stage innovation companies in Iowa.  The division
 25 23 further requires that such financial assistance shall not be
 25 24 distributed to owners or investors of the company to which the
 25 25 business development services are being provided and shall not
 25 26 be provided to other persons assisting with the provision of
 25 27 the services.
 25 28    Under current law, an entrepreneurial assistance provider is
 25 29 required to accept client referrals from the EDA as a condition
 25 30 of receiving a grant.  The division provides that the EDA may
 25 31 make client referrals to eligible providers.
 25 32    DIVISION IV ==== MISCELLANEOUS CHANGES.  Division IV makes
 25 33 several miscellaneous changes to other EDA programs.  The
 25 34 division amends the sales and use tax refund available under
 25 35 the workforce housing tax incentive program.  That refund
 26  1 is available for sales and use tax paid prior to project
 26  2 completion, which is currently defined to mean the first date
 26  3 upon which the average annualized production of finished
 26  4 product for the preceding 90=day period at the manufacturing
 26  5 facility operated by the eligible business is at least 50
 26  6 percent of the initial design capacity of the facility.  The
 26  7 division amends the definition of "project completion" to mean
 26  8 the date on which the EDA notifies the department of revenue
 26  9 that all applicable requirements of a workforce housing tax
 26 10 incentive program agreement are satisfied.  This provision
 26 11 takes effect upon enactment and applies retroactively to July
 26 12 1, 2014, for all workforce housing tax incentive agreements
 26 13 entered into on or after that date.
 26 14    The division allows the EDA to extend the project
 26 15 completion date for a project awarded tax incentives under the
 26 16 redevelopment tax credit program and the housing enterprise
 26 17 zone tax incentives program if the property that is the subject
 26 18 of the project suffered a catastrophic fire during the 2014
 26 19 calendar year.
       LSB 1212HV (3) 86
       mm/sc
 18 14    This bill relates to the administration of programs by the
 18 15 economic development authority (EDA) by creating a renewable
 18 16 chemical production tax credit, modifying the tax credit for
 18 17 investments in qualifying businesses and community=based seed
 18 18 capital funds, and modifying the entrepreneur investment awards
 18 19 program.
 18 20    DIVISION I ==== RENEWABLE CHEMICAL PRODUCTION TAX CREDIT.
 18 21   Division I creates a renewable chemical production tax credit
 18 22 program (program) that will be administered by the EDA and that
 18 23 will provide tax credits to eligible businesses that produce
 18 24 renewable chemicals in Iowa from biomass feedstock.  "Renewable
 18 25 chemical", "biomass feedstock", and other related terms are
 18 26 defined in the division.
 18 27    In order to qualify for the tax credit, a business must
 18 28 meet several requirements.  First, the business must be
 18 29 physically located in Iowa and operated for profit under
 18 30 single management.  Second, the business must not be an
 18 31 entity providing professional services, health care services,
 18 32 or medical treatments, or be engaged primarily in retail
 18 33 operations.  Third, the business must have organized, expanded,
 18 34 or located in Iowa on or after the effective date of the
 18 35 division.  Fourth, the business must not be, in the discretion
 19  1 of the EDA, ineligible under certain provisions relating to the
 19  2 relocation or reduction of business operations within Iowa.
 19  3 Fifth, the business must be in compliance with all agreements
 19  4 entered into under the program or other programs administered
 19  5 by the EDA.
 19  6    An eligible business seeking a tax credit is required
 19  7 to apply to the EDA during the calendar year following the
 19  8 calendar year in which the renewable chemicals are produced.
 19  9 The application must include the amount of renewable chemicals
 19 10 produced in Iowa from biomass feedstock by the eligible
 19 11 business during the calendar year, measured in pounds, and any
 19 12 other information reasonably required by the EDA in order to
 19 13 establish and verify eligibility under the program.  The EDA
 19 14 may accept applications on a continuous basis or may establish
 19 15 an annual application deadline.
 19 16    Before being issued a tax credit, an eligible business
 19 17 is required to enter into an agreement with the EDA for the
 19 18 successful completion of all requirements of the program.  The
 19 19 EDA is authorized to impose two compliance cost fees under the
 19 20 program.  The first fee equals $500 per agreement.  The second
 19 21 fee equals 0.5 percent of the value of the tax credit claimed
 19 22 pursuant to the agreement if the agreement has an aggregate tax
 19 23 credit value of $100,000 or greater.
 19 24    An eligible business that fails to comply with the
 19 25 requirements of the program or the terms of an agreement with
 19 26 the EDA may have its tax credits reduced, terminated, or
 19 27 rescinded, and may be subject to the repayment or recapture of
 19 28 claimed tax credits.
 19 29    Upon determining that all requirements of an agreement and
 19 30 the program have been fulfilled, the EDA shall issue a tax
 19 31 credit and related tax credit certificate to the eligible
 19 32 business in an amount equal to the product of $.05 multiplied
 19 33 by the number of pounds of renewable chemicals produced in Iowa
 19 34 from biomass feedstock by the eligible business during the
 19 35 calendar year.  Renewable chemicals produced by an eligible
 20  1 business prior to the effective date of the division, or
 20  2 prior to the date the business first qualifies as an eligible
 20  3 business, or after calendar year 2025, shall not qualify for
 20  4 the tax credit.
 20  5    The tax credit shall be claimed for the tax year during
 20  6 which the eligible business was issued the tax credit.  The tax
 20  7 credit may be claimed against the individual income tax and the
 20  8 corporate income tax.  The credit is refundable or may, at the
 20  9 election of the taxpayer, be carried forward for up to one tax
 20 10 year.   The tax credit shall not be transferred to any person.  A
 20 11 tax credit issued to a partnership, limited liability company,
 20 12 S corporation, cooperative organized under Code chapter 501
 20 13 and filing as a partnership for federal tax purposes, estate,
 20 14 or trust electing to have the income taxed directly to the
 20 15 individual may be claimed by the individual based upon the pro
 20 16 rata share of the individual's earnings from that entity.
 20 17    The division provides that the program is subject to the
 20 18 EDA's maximum aggregate tax credit cap of $170 million per
 20 19 fiscal year in Code section 15.119, and not more than $15
 20 20 million per fiscal year may be issued by the EDA under the
 20 21 program.  In addition, the maximum amount of tax credit that
 20 22 may be issued to an eligible business in any one calendar year
 20 23 shall not exceed $1 million or $500,000, depending on whether
 20 24 the eligible business has been operating in Iowa at the time of
 20 25 application for five or fewer years, or more than five years,
 20 26 respectively.  An eligible business shall not receive more than
 20 27 five tax credits under the program.  The EDA is required to
 20 28 issue tax credits on a first=come, first=served basis until the
 20 29 maximum amount of $15 million per fiscal year is reached.  If
 20 30 the amount of tax credits exceeds this amount in a fiscal year,
 20 31 the EDA is required to establish a wait list and give priority
 20 32 in subsequent years to the eligible businesses on the wait
 20 33 list.
 20 34    The division provides for the confidentiality of certain
 20 35 information under the program.  The identity of a tax credit
 21  1 recipient and the amount of the tax credit shall be considered
 21  2 public information under Code chapter 22 (examination of public
 21  3 records), but any other information or record in the possession
 21  4 of the EDA with respect to the program shall be presumed by
 21  5 the EDA to be a trade secret protected under Code chapter 550
 21  6 or common law and shall be kept confidential by the EDA unless
 21  7 otherwise ordered by a court.
 21  8    The division takes effect upon enactment and applies to
 21  9 renewable chemicals produced in Iowa from biomass feedstock on
 21 10 or after that date.  The division applies retroactively to tax
 21 11 years beginning on or after January 1, 2015.
 21 12    DIVISION II ==== ANGEL INVESTOR TAX CREDITS.   Division II
 21 13 makes several changes to the tax credit for investments in
 21 14 qualifying businesses and community=based seed capital funds,
 21 15 often referred to as the angel investor tax credits.  The
 21 16 division amends the purpose of the tax credit in Code section
 21 17 15E.41.  The division excludes investments in community=based
 21 18 seed capital funds from qualifying for the tax credit and
 21 19 makes several conforming amendments to remove references to
 21 20 community=based seed capital funds from the Code.
 21 21    The division modifies the amount and dollar limitation of
 21 22 the tax credit for a taxpayer.  The tax credit is increased
 21 23 from 20 percent to 25 percent of a taxpayer's equity investment
 21 24 in a qualifying business.  Under current law, a taxpayer cannot
 21 25 claim more than $50,000 of tax credit per investment in a
 21 26 qualifying business, and for each tax year a taxpayer and the
 21 27 taxpayer's affiliates cannot claim tax credits for more than
 21 28 five investments in five different qualifying businesses.  The
 21 29 division amends this dollar limitation to prohibit a natural
 21 30 person and the person's spouse, child, or sibling from claiming
 21 31 a combined amount of more than $100,000 in tax credits per tax
 21 32 year.
 21 33    The division also provides that no more than $500,000 in tax
 21 34 credits may be issued per tax year for equity investments in
 21 35 any one qualifying business.
 22  1 The division modifies the procedures for claiming the tax
 22  2 credit.  Under current law, the tax credit is not refundable
 22  3 but available for carryforward for up to five tax years.  The
 22  4 division makes the tax credit refundable for an investment
 22  5 made by a natural person, and for any other person reduces the
 22  6 carryforward period to three years.
 22  7    The division strikes a provision permitting the EDA
 22  8 to cooperate with small business development centers to
 22  9 disseminate information regarding the credits and to develop
 22 10 standard application forms, and requiring the EDA to distribute
 22 11 copies of the application forms to all community=based seed
 22 12 capital funds and potential individual investors.
 22 13    The division modifies the eligibility requirements for
 22 14 qualifying businesses.  The division strikes the requirement
 22 15 that a business have an owner that meets at least one of
 22 16 four qualifications relating to business education or
 22 17 business experience.  The division requires that a business
 22 18 be participating in an entrepreneurial assistance program,
 22 19 as defined in the division, but allows the EDA to waive this
 22 20 requirement if the business establishes that its owners,
 22 21 directors, officers, and employees have an appropriate level
 22 22 of experience such that an entrepreneurial assistance program
 22 23 would not materially change the prospects of the business.
 22 24 The EDA is allowed to consult with outside service providers
 22 25 in considering such a waiver.  The division increases from $5
 22 26 million to $10 million the maximum amount of net worth that
 22 27 a business may have to be considered a qualifying business.
 22 28 The division increases from $250,000 to $500,000 the amount of
 22 29 financing that a business must have in order to be considered a
 22 30 qualifying business, removes "near equity" from the types of
 22 31 financing that will be considered in that calculation, requires
 22 32 that the financing be secured at the time of application for
 22 33 the tax credits, and requires that the business have at least
 22 34 two investors at the time of application for the tax credits.
 22 35 These modified eligibility requirements apply to businesses
 23  1 that submit an application to the EDA to be registered as a
 23  2 qualifying business on or after the effective date of this
 23  3 division of the bill, and businesses that submitted such an
 23  4 application to the EDA before the effective date of this
 23  5 division of the bill shall be governed by current law.
 23  6    The division provides for the confidentiality of certain
 23  7 information with regard to the tax credit.  The identity of
 23  8 a qualifying business, the identity of an investor and the
 23  9 qualifying business in which the investor made an equity
 23 10 investment, and the total number and amount of tax credits
 23 11 issued shall be considered public information under Code
 23 12 chapter 22 (examination of public records), but any other
 23 13 information or record in the possession of the EDA with respect
 23 14 to the program shall be presumed by the EDA to be a trade secret
 23 15 protected under Code chapter 550 or common law and shall be
 23 16 kept confidential by the EDA unless otherwise ordered by a
 23 17 court.
 23 18    The division takes effect upon enactment and applies to
 23 19 equity investments in a qualifying business made on or after
 23 20 that date.  Equity investments in a qualifying business or
 23 21 community=based seed capital fund made prior to the effective
 23 22 date of the division shall be governed by current law.
 23 23    DIVISION III ==== ENTREPRENEUR INVESTMENT AWARDS PROGRAM.
 23 24  Division III amends the entrepreneur investment awards program
 23 25 administered by the EDA.  The division strikes provisions that
 23 26 prohibited the EDA from making awards under the program since
 23 27 July 1, 2014, and that required the EDA by December 31, 2014,
 23 28 to conduct a comprehensive review of the program and submit
 23 29 a report with specified information to the governor and the
 23 30 general assembly.
 23 31    The division modifies the purpose of the program to be
 23 32 to provide financial assistance to eligible entrepreneurial
 23 33 assistance providers (provider) that provide technical and
 23 34 financial assistance to entrepreneurs and start=up companies
 23 35 seeking to create, locate, or expand a business in Iowa.
 24  1 "Financial assistance" is defined in the division.
 24  2    The division changes the requirements for receiving an
 24  3 award.  To be eligible to receive an award under current
 24  4 law, an entrepreneurial assistance program must have been
 24  5 an Iowa=based business, expended at least $500,000 during
 24  6 the previous fiscal year to provide technical and financial
 24  7 assistance services that meet the broad=based needs of
 24  8 entrepreneurs seeking to create, locate, or expand a business
 24  9 in Iowa that intends to derive more than 10 percent of its
 24 10 gross sales from markets outside Iowa; and must have engaged
 24 11 and communicated with certain other programs, funding sources,
 24 12 and entities for its entrepreneur clients.  The division
 24 13 amends the eligibility for receiving financial assistance to
 24 14 require that a provider have its principal place of operations
 24 15 in Iowa and that the provider offer a comprehensive set of
 24 16 business development services to emerging and early=stage
 24 17 innovation companies to assist in the creation, location,
 24 18 growth, and long=term success of the company in Iowa.
 24 19 "Business development services" is defined in the division.
 24 20 Business development services may be performed at the physical
 24 21 location of the provider or the company and may be provided in
 24 22 consideration of equity participation in the company, a fee for
 24 23 services, or a membership agreement with the company.
 24 24    Under current law, the EDA board could approve, deny, or
 24 25 defer each application for a grant, and was required to award
 24 26 grants on a first=come, first=served basis.  The division
 24 27 specifies that the EDA board has the discretion to approve,
 24 28 deny, or defer each application for financial assistance and
 24 29 that the amount of financial assistance awarded to a provider
 24 30 is within the discretion of the EDA.  The division requires
 24 31 the EDA to award financial assistance on a competitive basis
 24 32 and allows the EDA to develop scoring criteria and establish
 24 33 minimum requirements for the receipt of a financial assistance
 24 34 award.
 24 35    In addition to the four factors relating to the provider's
 25  1 professional staff that the EDA may consider under current
 25  2 law in deciding whether to award financial assistance, the
 25  3 division provides that the EDA may also consider the service
 25  4 model and likelihood of success of the provider, the provider's
 25  5 similarity to other successful providers in the country, and
 25  6 the provider's financial need.
 25  7    The division modifies the maximum award amount for a
 25  8 recipient.  Under current law, a grant to an entrepreneur
 25  9 assistance program cannot exceed the lesser of 25 percent of
 25 10 the funds expended by the program during the previous fiscal
 25 11 year, 100 percent of the funds raised from certain persons
 25 12 by the program during the previous fiscal year, or $200,000.
 25 13 The division provides that the amount of financial assistance
 25 14 awarded to any one provider shall not exceed $200,000.
 25 15    The division modifies the permitted use of funds received
 25 16 under the program.  Under current law, grants are only
 25 17 permitted to be used for the purpose of operating costs
 25 18 incurred by the program.  The division specifies that financial
 25 19 assistance awarded to a provider shall only be used for
 25 20 the purpose of operating costs incurred by the provider in
 25 21 the provision of business development services to emerging
 25 22 and early=stage innovation companies in Iowa.  The division
 25 23 further requires that such financial assistance shall not be
 25 24 distributed to owners or investors of the company to which the
 25 25 business development services are being provided and shall not
 25 26 be provided to other persons assisting with the provision of
 25 27 the services.
 25 28    Under current law, an entrepreneurial assistance provider is
 25 29 required to accept client referrals from the EDA as a condition
 25 30 of receiving a grant.  The division provides that the EDA may
 25 31 make client referrals to eligible providers.
 25 32    DIVISION IV ==== MISCELLANEOUS CHANGES.  Division IV makes
 25 33 several miscellaneous changes to other EDA programs.  The
 25 34 division amends the sales and use tax refund available under
 25 35 the workforce housing tax incentive program.  That refund
 26  1 is available for sales and use tax paid prior to project
 26  2 completion, which is currently defined to mean the first date
 26  3 upon which the average annualized production of finished
 26  4 product for the preceding 90=day period at the manufacturing
 26  5 facility operated by the eligible business is at least 50
 26  6 percent of the initial design capacity of the facility.  The
 26  7 division amends the definition of "project completion" to mean
 26  8 the date on which the EDA notifies the department of revenue
 26  9 that all applicable requirements of a workforce housing tax
 26 10 incentive program agreement are satisfied.  This provision
 26 11 takes effect upon enactment and applies retroactively to July
 26 12 1, 2014, for all workforce housing tax incentive agreements
 26 13 entered into on or after that date.
 26 14    The division allows the EDA to extend the project
 26 15 completion date for a project awarded tax incentives under the
 26 16 redevelopment tax credit program and the housing enterprise
 26 17 zone tax incentives program if the property that is the subject
 26 18 of the project suffered a catastrophic fire during the 2014
 26 19 calendar year.
       LSB 1212HV (3) 86
       mm/sc
 18 15 economic development authority (EDA) by creating a renewable
 18 16 chemical production tax credit, modifying the tax credit for
 18 17 investments in qualifying businesses and community=based seed
 18 18 capital funds, and modifying the entrepreneur investment awards
 18 19 program.
 18 20    DIVISION I ==== RENEWABLE CHEMICAL PRODUCTION TAX CREDIT.
 18 21   Division I creates a renewable chemical production tax credit
 18 22 program (program) that will be administered by the EDA and that
 18 23 will provide tax credits to eligible businesses that produce
 18 24 renewable chemicals in Iowa from biomass feedstock.  "Renewable
 18 25 chemical", "biomass feedstock", and other related terms are
 18 26 defined in the division.
 18 27    In order to qualify for the tax credit, a business must
 18 28 meet several requirements.  First, the business must be
 18 29 physically located in Iowa and operated for profit under
 18 30 single management.  Second, the business must not be an
 18 31 entity providing professional services, health care services,
 18 32 or medical treatments, or be engaged primarily in retail
 18 33 operations.  Third, the business must have organized, expanded,
 18 34 or located in Iowa on or after the effective date of the
 18 35 division.  Fourth, the business must not be, in the discretion
 19  1 of the EDA, ineligible under certain provisions relating to the
 19  2 relocation or reduction of business operations within Iowa.
 19  3 Fifth, the business must be in compliance with all agreements
 19  4 entered into under the program or other programs administered
 19  5 by the EDA.
 19  6    An eligible business seeking a tax credit is required
 19  7 to apply to the EDA during the calendar year following the
 19  8 calendar year in which the renewable chemicals are produced.
 19  9 The application must include the amount of renewable chemicals
 19 10 produced in Iowa from biomass feedstock by the eligible
 19 11 business during the calendar year, measured in pounds, and any
 19 12 other information reasonably required by the EDA in order to
 19 13 establish and verify eligibility under the program.  The EDA
 19 14 may accept applications on a continuous basis or may establish
 19 15 an annual application deadline.
 19 16    Before being issued a tax credit, an eligible business
 19 17 is required to enter into an agreement with the EDA for the
 19 18 successful completion of all requirements of the program.  The
 19 19 EDA is authorized to impose two compliance cost fees under the
 19 20 program.  The first fee equals $500 per agreement.  The second
 19 21 fee equals 0.5 percent of the value of the tax credit claimed
 19 22 pursuant to the agreement if the agreement has an aggregate tax
 19 23 credit value of $100,000 or greater.
 19 24    An eligible business that fails to comply with the
 19 25 requirements of the program or the terms of an agreement with
 19 26 the EDA may have its tax credits reduced, terminated, or
 19 27 rescinded, and may be subject to the repayment or recapture of
 19 28 claimed tax credits.
 19 29    Upon determining that all requirements of an agreement and
 19 30 the program have been fulfilled, the EDA shall issue a tax
 19 31 credit and related tax credit certificate to the eligible
 19 32 business in an amount equal to the product of $.05 multiplied
 19 33 by the number of pounds of renewable chemicals produced in Iowa
 19 34 from biomass feedstock by the eligible business during the
 19 35 calendar year.  Renewable chemicals produced by an eligible
 20  1 business prior to the effective date of the division, or
 20  2 prior to the date the business first qualifies as an eligible
 20  3 business, or after calendar year 2025, shall not qualify for
 20  4 the tax credit.
 20  5    The tax credit shall be claimed for the tax year during
 20  6 which the eligible business was issued the tax credit.  The tax
 20  7 credit may be claimed against the individual income tax and the
 20  8 corporate income tax.  The credit is refundable or may, at the
 20  9 election of the taxpayer, be carried forward for up to one tax
 20 10 year.   The tax credit shall not be transferred to any person.  A
 20 11 tax credit issued to a partnership, limited liability company,
 20 12 S corporation, cooperative organized under Code chapter 501
 20 13 and filing as a partnership for federal tax purposes, estate,
 20 14 or trust electing to have the income taxed directly to the
 20 15 individual may be claimed by the individual based upon the pro
 20 16 rata share of the individual's earnings from that entity.
 20 17    The division provides that the program is subject to the
 20 18 EDA's maximum aggregate tax credit cap of $170 million per
 20 19 fiscal year in Code section 15.119, and not more than $15
 20 20 million per fiscal year may be issued by the EDA under the
 20 21 program.  In addition, the maximum amount of tax credit that
 20 22 may be issued to an eligible business in any one calendar year
 20 23 shall not exceed $1 million or $500,000, depending on whether
 20 24 the eligible business has been operating in Iowa at the time of
 20 25 application for five or fewer years, or more than five years,
 20 26 respectively.  An eligible business shall not receive more than
 20 27 five tax credits under the program.  The EDA is required to
 20 28 issue tax credits on a first=come, first=served basis until the
 20 29 maximum amount of $15 million per fiscal year is reached.  If
 20 30 the amount of tax credits exceeds this amount in a fiscal year,
 20 31 the EDA is required to establish a wait list and give priority
 20 32 in subsequent years to the eligible businesses on the wait
 20 33 list.
 20 34    The division provides for the confidentiality of certain
 20 35 information under the program.  The identity of a tax credit
 21  1 recipient and the amount of the tax credit shall be considered
 21  2 public information under Code chapter 22 (examination of public
 21  3 records), but any other information or record in the possession
 21  4 of the EDA with respect to the program shall be presumed by
 21  5 the EDA to be a trade secret protected under Code chapter 550
 21  6 or common law and shall be kept confidential by the EDA unless
 21  7 otherwise ordered by a court.
 21  8    The division takes effect upon enactment and applies to
 21  9 renewable chemicals produced in Iowa from biomass feedstock on
 21 10 or after that date.  The division applies retroactively to tax
 21 11 years beginning on or after January 1, 2015.
 21 12    DIVISION II ==== ANGEL INVESTOR TAX CREDITS.   Division II
 21 13 makes several changes to the tax credit for investments in
 21 14 qualifying businesses and community=based seed capital funds,
 21 15 often referred to as the angel investor tax credits.  The
 21 16 division amends the purpose of the tax credit in Code section
 21 17 15E.41.  The division excludes investments in community=based
 21 18 seed capital funds from qualifying for the tax credit and
 21 19 makes several conforming amendments to remove references to
 21 20 community=based seed capital funds from the Code.
 21 21    The division modifies the amount and dollar limitation of
 21 22 the tax credit for a taxpayer.  The tax credit is increased
 21 23 from 20 percent to 25 percent of a taxpayer's equity investment
 21 24 in a qualifying business.  Under current law, a taxpayer cannot
 21 25 claim more than $50,000 of tax credit per investment in a
 21 26 qualifying business, and for each tax year a taxpayer and the
 21 27 taxpayer's affiliates cannot claim tax credits for more than
 21 28 five investments in five different qualifying businesses.  The
 21 29 division amends this dollar limitation to prohibit a natural
 21 30 person and the person's spouse, child, or sibling from claiming
 21 31 a combined amount of more than $100,000 in tax credits per tax
 21 32 year.
 21 33    The division also provides that no more than $500,000 in tax
 21 34 credits may be issued per tax year for equity investments in
 21 35 any one qualifying business.
 22  1 The division modifies the procedures for claiming the tax
 22  2 credit.  Under current law, the tax credit is not refundable
 22  3 but available for carryforward for up to five tax years.  The
 22  4 division makes the tax credit refundable for an investment
 22  5 made by a natural person, and for any other person reduces the
 22  6 carryforward period to three years.
 22  7    The division strikes a provision permitting the EDA
 22  8 to cooperate with small business development centers to
 22  9 disseminate information regarding the credits and to develop
 22 10 standard application forms, and requiring the EDA to distribute
 22 11 copies of the application forms to all community=based seed
 22 12 capital funds and potential individual investors.
 22 13    The division modifies the eligibility requirements for
 22 14 qualifying businesses.  The division strikes the requirement
 22 15 that a business have an owner that meets at least one of
 22 16 four qualifications relating to business education or
 22 17 business experience.  The division requires that a business
 22 18 be participating in an entrepreneurial assistance program,
 22 19 as defined in the division, but allows the EDA to waive this
 22 20 requirement if the business establishes that its owners,
 22 21 directors, officers, and employees have an appropriate level
 22 22 of experience such that an entrepreneurial assistance program
 22 23 would not materially change the prospects of the business.
 22 24 The EDA is allowed to consult with outside service providers
 22 25 in considering such a waiver.  The division increases from $5
 22 26 million to $10 million the maximum amount of net worth that
 22 27 a business may have to be considered a qualifying business.
 22 28 The division increases from $250,000 to $500,000 the amount of
 22 29 financing that a business must have in order to be considered a
 22 30 qualifying business, removes "near equity" from the types of
 22 31 financing that will be considered in that calculation, requires
 22 32 that the financing be secured at the time of application for
 22 33 the tax credits, and requires that the business have at least
 22 34 two investors at the time of application for the tax credits.
 22 35 These modified eligibility requirements apply to businesses
 23  1 that submit an application to the EDA to be registered as a
 23  2 qualifying business on or after the effective date of this
 23  3 division of the bill, and businesses that submitted such an
 23  4 application to the EDA before the effective date of this
 23  5 division of the bill shall be governed by current law.
 23  6    The division provides for the confidentiality of certain
 23  7 information with regard to the tax credit.  The identity of
 23  8 a qualifying business, the identity of an investor and the
 23  9 qualifying business in which the investor made an equity
 23 10 investment, and the total number and amount of tax credits
 23 11 issued shall be considered public information under Code
 23 12 chapter 22 (examination of public records), but any other
 23 13 information or record in the possession of the EDA with respect
 23 14 to the program shall be presumed by the EDA to be a trade secret
 23 15 protected under Code chapter 550 or common law and shall be
 23 16 kept confidential by the EDA unless otherwise ordered by a
 23 17 court.
 23 18    The division takes effect upon enactment and applies to
 23 19 equity investments in a qualifying business made on or after
 23 20 that date.  Equity investments in a qualifying business or
 23 21 community=based seed capital fund made prior to the effective
 23 22 date of the division shall be governed by current law.
 23 23    DIVISION III ==== ENTREPRENEUR INVESTMENT AWARDS PROGRAM.
 23 24  Division III amends the entrepreneur investment awards program
 23 25 administered by the EDA.  The division strikes provisions that
 23 26 prohibited the EDA from making awards under the program since
 23 27 July 1, 2014, and that required the EDA by December 31, 2014,
 23 28 to conduct a comprehensive review of the program and submit
 23 29 a report with specified information to the governor and the
 23 30 general assembly.
 23 31    The division modifies the purpose of the program to be
 23 32 to provide financial assistance to eligible entrepreneurial
 23 33 assistance providers (provider) that provide technical and
 23 34 financial assistance to entrepreneurs and start=up companies
 23 35 seeking to create, locate, or expand a business in Iowa.
 24  1 "Financial assistance" is defined in the division.
 24  2    The division changes the requirements for receiving an
 24  3 award.  To be eligible to receive an award under current
 24  4 law, an entrepreneurial assistance program must have been
 24  5 an Iowa=based business, expended at least $500,000 during
 24  6 the previous fiscal year to provide technical and financial
 24  7 assistance services that meet the broad=based needs of
 24  8 entrepreneurs seeking to create, locate, or expand a business
 24  9 in Iowa that intends to derive more than 10 percent of its
 24 10 gross sales from markets outside Iowa; and must have engaged
 24 11 and communicated with certain other programs, funding sources,
 24 12 and entities for its entrepreneur clients.  The division
 24 13 amends the eligibility for receiving financial assistance to
 24 14 require that a provider have its principal place of operations
 24 15 in Iowa and that the provider offer a comprehensive set of
 24 16 business development services to emerging and early=stage
 24 17 innovation companies to assist in the creation, location,
 24 18 growth, and long=term success of the company in Iowa.
 24 19 "Business development services" is defined in the division.
 24 20 Business development services may be performed at the physical
 24 21 location of the provider or the company and may be provided in
 24 22 consideration of equity participation in the company, a fee for
 24 23 services, or a membership agreement with the company.
 24 24    Under current law, the EDA board could approve, deny, or
 24 25 defer each application for a grant, and was required to award
 24 26 grants on a first=come, first=served basis.  The division
 24 27 specifies that the EDA board has the discretion to approve,
 24 28 deny, or defer each application for financial assistance and
 24 29 that the amount of financial assistance awarded to a provider
 24 30 is within the discretion of the EDA.  The division requires
 24 31 the EDA to award financial assistance on a competitive basis
 24 32 and allows the EDA to develop scoring criteria and establish
 24 33 minimum requirements for the receipt of a financial assistance
 24 34 award.
 24 35    In addition to the four factors relating to the provider's
 25  1 professional staff that the EDA may consider under current
 25  2 law in deciding whether to award financial assistance, the
 25  3 division provides that the EDA may also consider the service
 25  4 model and likelihood of success of the provider, the provider's
 25  5 similarity to other successful providers in the country, and
 25  6 the provider's financial need.
 25  7    The division modifies the maximum award amount for a
 25  8 recipient.  Under current law, a grant to an entrepreneur
 25  9 assistance program cannot exceed the lesser of 25 percent of
 25 10 the funds expended by the program during the previous fiscal
 25 11 year, 100 percent of the funds raised from certain persons
 25 12 by the program during the previous fiscal year, or $200,000.
 25 13 The division provides that the amount of financial assistance
 25 14 awarded to any one provider shall not exceed $200,000.
 25 15    The division modifies the permitted use of funds received
 25 16 under the program.  Under current law, grants are only
 25 17 permitted to be used for the purpose of operating costs
 25 18 incurred by the program.  The division specifies that financial
 25 19 assistance awarded to a provider shall only be used for
 25 20 the purpose of operating costs incurred by the provider in
 25 21 the provision of business development services to emerging
 25 22 and early=stage innovation companies in Iowa.  The division
 25 23 further requires that such financial assistance shall not be
 25 24 distributed to owners or investors of the company to which the
 25 25 business development services are being provided and shall not
 25 26 be provided to other persons assisting with the provision of
 25 27 the services.
 25 28    Under current law, an entrepreneurial assistance provider is
 25 29 required to accept client referrals from the EDA as a condition
 25 30 of receiving a grant.  The division provides that the EDA may
 25 31 make client referrals to eligible providers.
 25 32    DIVISION IV ==== MISCELLANEOUS CHANGES.  Division IV makes
 25 33 several miscellaneous changes to other EDA programs.  The
 25 34 division amends the sales and use tax refund available under
 25 35 the workforce housing tax incentive program.  That refund
 26  1 is available for sales and use tax paid prior to project
 26  2 completion, which is currently defined to mean the first date
 26  3 upon which the average annualized production of finished
 26  4 product for the preceding 90=day period at the manufacturing
 26  5 facility operated by the eligible business is at least 50
 26  6 percent of the initial design capacity of the facility.  The
 26  7 division amends the definition of "project completion" to mean
 26  8 the date on which the EDA notifies the department of revenue
 26  9 that all applicable requirements of a workforce housing tax
 26 10 incentive program agreement are satisfied.  This provision
 26 11 takes effect upon enactment and applies retroactively to July
 26 12 1, 2014, for all workforce housing tax incentive agreements
 26 13 entered into on or after that date.
 26 14    The division allows the EDA to extend the project
 26 15 completion date for a project awarded tax incentives under the
 26 16 redevelopment tax credit program and the housing enterprise
 26 17 zone tax incentives program if the property that is the subject
 26 18 of the project suffered a catastrophic fire during the 2014
 26 19 calendar year.
       LSB 1212HV (3) 86
       mm/sc
 18 16 chemical production tax credit, modifying the tax credit for
 18 17 investments in qualifying businesses and community=based seed
 18 18 capital funds, and modifying the entrepreneur investment awards
 18 19 program.
 18 20    DIVISION I ==== RENEWABLE CHEMICAL PRODUCTION TAX CREDIT.
 18 21   Division I creates a renewable chemical production tax credit
 18 22 program (program) that will be administered by the EDA and that
 18 23 will provide tax credits to eligible businesses that produce
 18 24 renewable chemicals in Iowa from biomass feedstock.  "Renewable
 18 25 chemical", "biomass feedstock", and other related terms are
 18 26 defined in the division.
 18 27    In order to qualify for the tax credit, a business must
 18 28 meet several requirements.  First, the business must be
 18 29 physically located in Iowa and operated for profit under
 18 30 single management.  Second, the business must not be an
 18 31 entity providing professional services, health care services,
 18 32 or medical treatments, or be engaged primarily in retail
 18 33 operations.  Third, the business must have organized, expanded,
 18 34 or located in Iowa on or after the effective date of the
 18 35 division.  Fourth, the business must not be, in the discretion
 19  1 of the EDA, ineligible under certain provisions relating to the
 19  2 relocation or reduction of business operations within Iowa.
 19  3 Fifth, the business must be in compliance with all agreements
 19  4 entered into under the program or other programs administered
 19  5 by the EDA.
 19  6    An eligible business seeking a tax credit is required
 19  7 to apply to the EDA during the calendar year following the
 19  8 calendar year in which the renewable chemicals are produced.
 19  9 The application must include the amount of renewable chemicals
 19 10 produced in Iowa from biomass feedstock by the eligible
 19 11 business during the calendar year, measured in pounds, and any
 19 12 other information reasonably required by the EDA in order to
 19 13 establish and verify eligibility under the program.  The EDA
 19 14 may accept applications on a continuous basis or may establish
 19 15 an annual application deadline.
 19 16    Before being issued a tax credit, an eligible business
 19 17 is required to enter into an agreement with the EDA for the
 19 18 successful completion of all requirements of the program.  The
 19 19 EDA is authorized to impose two compliance cost fees under the
 19 20 program.  The first fee equals $500 per agreement.  The second
 19 21 fee equals 0.5 percent of the value of the tax credit claimed
 19 22 pursuant to the agreement if the agreement has an aggregate tax
 19 23 credit value of $100,000 or greater.
 19 24    An eligible business that fails to comply with the
 19 25 requirements of the program or the terms of an agreement with
 19 26 the EDA may have its tax credits reduced, terminated, or
 19 27 rescinded, and may be subject to the repayment or recapture of
 19 28 claimed tax credits.
 19 29    Upon determining that all requirements of an agreement and
 19 30 the program have been fulfilled, the EDA shall issue a tax
 19 31 credit and related tax credit certificate to the eligible
 19 32 business in an amount equal to the product of $.05 multiplied
 19 33 by the number of pounds of renewable chemicals produced in Iowa
 19 34 from biomass feedstock by the eligible business during the
 19 35 calendar year.  Renewable chemicals produced by an eligible
 20  1 business prior to the effective date of the division, or
 20  2 prior to the date the business first qualifies as an eligible
 20  3 business, or after calendar year 2025, shall not qualify for
 20  4 the tax credit.
 20  5    The tax credit shall be claimed for the tax year during
 20  6 which the eligible business was issued the tax credit.  The tax
 20  7 credit may be claimed against the individual income tax and the
 20  8 corporate income tax.  The credit is refundable or may, at the
 20  9 election of the taxpayer, be carried forward for up to one tax
 20 10 year.   The tax credit shall not be transferred to any person.  A
 20 11 tax credit issued to a partnership, limited liability company,
 20 12 S corporation, cooperative organized under Code chapter 501
 20 13 and filing as a partnership for federal tax purposes, estate,
 20 14 or trust electing to have the income taxed directly to the
 20 15 individual may be claimed by the individual based upon the pro
 20 16 rata share of the individual's earnings from that entity.
 20 17    The division provides that the program is subject to the
 20 18 EDA's maximum aggregate tax credit cap of $170 million per
 20 19 fiscal year in Code section 15.119, and not more than $15
 20 20 million per fiscal year may be issued by the EDA under the
 20 21 program.  In addition, the maximum amount of tax credit that
 20 22 may be issued to an eligible business in any one calendar year
 20 23 shall not exceed $1 million or $500,000, depending on whether
 20 24 the eligible business has been operating in Iowa at the time of
 20 25 application for five or fewer years, or more than five years,
 20 26 respectively.  An eligible business shall not receive more than
 20 27 five tax credits under the program.  The EDA is required to
 20 28 issue tax credits on a first=come, first=served basis until the
 20 29 maximum amount of $15 million per fiscal year is reached.  If
 20 30 the amount of tax credits exceeds this amount in a fiscal year,
 20 31 the EDA is required to establish a wait list and give priority
 20 32 in subsequent years to the eligible businesses on the wait
 20 33 list.
 20 34    The division provides for the confidentiality of certain
 20 35 information under the program.  The identity of a tax credit
 21  1 recipient and the amount of the tax credit shall be considered
 21  2 public information under Code chapter 22 (examination of public
 21  3 records), but any other information or record in the possession
 21  4 of the EDA with respect to the program shall be presumed by
 21  5 the EDA to be a trade secret protected under Code chapter 550
 21  6 or common law and shall be kept confidential by the EDA unless
 21  7 otherwise ordered by a court.
 21  8    The division takes effect upon enactment and applies to
 21  9 renewable chemicals produced in Iowa from biomass feedstock on
 21 10 or after that date.  The division applies retroactively to tax
 21 11 years beginning on or after January 1, 2015.
 21 12    DIVISION II ==== ANGEL INVESTOR TAX CREDITS.   Division II
 21 13 makes several changes to the tax credit for investments in
 21 14 qualifying businesses and community=based seed capital funds,
 21 15 often referred to as the angel investor tax credits.  The
 21 16 division amends the purpose of the tax credit in Code section
 21 17 15E.41.  The division excludes investments in community=based
 21 18 seed capital funds from qualifying for the tax credit and
 21 19 makes several conforming amendments to remove references to
 21 20 community=based seed capital funds from the Code.
 21 21    The division modifies the amount and dollar limitation of
 21 22 the tax credit for a taxpayer.  The tax credit is increased
 21 23 from 20 percent to 25 percent of a taxpayer's equity investment
 21 24 in a qualifying business.  Under current law, a taxpayer cannot
 21 25 claim more than $50,000 of tax credit per investment in a
 21 26 qualifying business, and for each tax year a taxpayer and the
 21 27 taxpayer's affiliates cannot claim tax credits for more than
 21 28 five investments in five different qualifying businesses.  The
 21 29 division amends this dollar limitation to prohibit a natural
 21 30 person and the person's spouse, child, or sibling from claiming
 21 31 a combined amount of more than $100,000 in tax credits per tax
 21 32 year.
 21 33    The division also provides that no more than $500,000 in tax
 21 34 credits may be issued per tax year for equity investments in
 21 35 any one qualifying business.
 22  1 The division modifies the procedures for claiming the tax
 22  2 credit.  Under current law, the tax credit is not refundable
 22  3 but available for carryforward for up to five tax years.  The
 22  4 division makes the tax credit refundable for an investment
 22  5 made by a natural person, and for any other person reduces the
 22  6 carryforward period to three years.
 22  7    The division strikes a provision permitting the EDA
 22  8 to cooperate with small business development centers to
 22  9 disseminate information regarding the credits and to develop
 22 10 standard application forms, and requiring the EDA to distribute
 22 11 copies of the application forms to all community=based seed
 22 12 capital funds and potential individual investors.
 22 13    The division modifies the eligibility requirements for
 22 14 qualifying businesses.  The division strikes the requirement
 22 15 that a business have an owner that meets at least one of
 22 16 four qualifications relating to business education or
 22 17 business experience.  The division requires that a business
 22 18 be participating in an entrepreneurial assistance program,
 22 19 as defined in the division, but allows the EDA to waive this
 22 20 requirement if the business establishes that its owners,
 22 21 directors, officers, and employees have an appropriate level
 22 22 of experience such that an entrepreneurial assistance program
 22 23 would not materially change the prospects of the business.
 22 24 The EDA is allowed to consult with outside service providers
 22 25 in considering such a waiver.  The division increases from $5
 22 26 million to $10 million the maximum amount of net worth that
 22 27 a business may have to be considered a qualifying business.
 22 28 The division increases from $250,000 to $500,000 the amount of
 22 29 financing that a business must have in order to be considered a
 22 30 qualifying business, removes "near equity" from the types of
 22 31 financing that will be considered in that calculation, requires
 22 32 that the financing be secured at the time of application for
 22 33 the tax credits, and requires that the business have at least
 22 34 two investors at the time of application for the tax credits.
 22 35 These modified eligibility requirements apply to businesses
 23  1 that submit an application to the EDA to be registered as a
 23  2 qualifying business on or after the effective date of this
 23  3 division of the bill, and businesses that submitted such an
 23  4 application to the EDA before the effective date of this
 23  5 division of the bill shall be governed by current law.
 23  6    The division provides for the confidentiality of certain
 23  7 information with regard to the tax credit.  The identity of
 23  8 a qualifying business, the identity of an investor and the
 23  9 qualifying business in which the investor made an equity
 23 10 investment, and the total number and amount of tax credits
 23 11 issued shall be considered public information under Code
 23 12 chapter 22 (examination of public records), but any other
 23 13 information or record in the possession of the EDA with respect
 23 14 to the program shall be presumed by the EDA to be a trade secret
 23 15 protected under Code chapter 550 or common law and shall be
 23 16 kept confidential by the EDA unless otherwise ordered by a
 23 17 court.
 23 18    The division takes effect upon enactment and applies to
 23 19 equity investments in a qualifying business made on or after
 23 20 that date.  Equity investments in a qualifying business or
 23 21 community=based seed capital fund made prior to the effective
 23 22 date of the division shall be governed by current law.
 23 23    DIVISION III ==== ENTREPRENEUR INVESTMENT AWARDS PROGRAM.
 23 24  Division III amends the entrepreneur investment awards program
 23 25 administered by the EDA.  The division strikes provisions that
 23 26 prohibited the EDA from making awards under the program since
 23 27 July 1, 2014, and that required the EDA by December 31, 2014,
 23 28 to conduct a comprehensive review of the program and submit
 23 29 a report with specified information to the governor and the
 23 30 general assembly.
 23 31    The division modifies the purpose of the program to be
 23 32 to provide financial assistance to eligible entrepreneurial
 23 33 assistance providers (provider) that provide technical and
 23 34 financial assistance to entrepreneurs and start=up companies
 23 35 seeking to create, locate, or expand a business in Iowa.
 24  1 "Financial assistance" is defined in the division.
 24  2    The division changes the requirements for receiving an
 24  3 award.  To be eligible to receive an award under current
 24  4 law, an entrepreneurial assistance program must have been
 24  5 an Iowa=based business, expended at least $500,000 during
 24  6 the previous fiscal year to provide technical and financial
 24  7 assistance services that meet the broad=based needs of
 24  8 entrepreneurs seeking to create, locate, or expand a business
 24  9 in Iowa that intends to derive more than 10 percent of its
 24 10 gross sales from markets outside Iowa; and must have engaged
 24 11 and communicated with certain other programs, funding sources,
 24 12 and entities for its entrepreneur clients.  The division
 24 13 amends the eligibility for receiving financial assistance to
 24 14 require that a provider have its principal place of operations
 24 15 in Iowa and that the provider offer a comprehensive set of
 24 16 business development services to emerging and early=stage
 24 17 innovation companies to assist in the creation, location,
 24 18 growth, and long=term success of the company in Iowa.
 24 19 "Business development services" is defined in the division.
 24 20 Business development services may be performed at the physical
 24 21 location of the provider or the company and may be provided in
 24 22 consideration of equity participation in the company, a fee for
 24 23 services, or a membership agreement with the company.
 24 24    Under current law, the EDA board could approve, deny, or
 24 25 defer each application for a grant, and was required to award
 24 26 grants on a first=come, first=served basis.  The division
 24 27 specifies that the EDA board has the discretion to approve,
 24 28 deny, or defer each application for financial assistance and
 24 29 that the amount of financial assistance awarded to a provider
 24 30 is within the discretion of the EDA.  The division requires
 24 31 the EDA to award financial assistance on a competitive basis
 24 32 and allows the EDA to develop scoring criteria and establish
 24 33 minimum requirements for the receipt of a financial assistance
 24 34 award.
 24 35    In addition to the four factors relating to the provider's
 25  1 professional staff that the EDA may consider under current
 25  2 law in deciding whether to award financial assistance, the
 25  3 division provides that the EDA may also consider the service
 25  4 model and likelihood of success of the provider, the provider's
 25  5 similarity to other successful providers in the country, and
 25  6 the provider's financial need.
 25  7    The division modifies the maximum award amount for a
 25  8 recipient.  Under current law, a grant to an entrepreneur
 25  9 assistance program cannot exceed the lesser of 25 percent of
 25 10 the funds expended by the program during the previous fiscal
 25 11 year, 100 percent of the funds raised from certain persons
 25 12 by the program during the previous fiscal year, or $200,000.
 25 13 The division provides that the amount of financial assistance
 25 14 awarded to any one provider shall not exceed $200,000.
 25 15    The division modifies the permitted use of funds received
 25 16 under the program.  Under current law, grants are only
 25 17 permitted to be used for the purpose of operating costs
 25 18 incurred by the program.  The division specifies that financial
 25 19 assistance awarded to a provider shall only be used for
 25 20 the purpose of operating costs incurred by the provider in
 25 21 the provision of business development services to emerging
 25 22 and early=stage innovation companies in Iowa.  The division
 25 23 further requires that such financial assistance shall not be
 25 24 distributed to owners or investors of the company to which the
 25 25 business development services are being provided and shall not
 25 26 be provided to other persons assisting with the provision of
 25 27 the services.
 25 28    Under current law, an entrepreneurial assistance provider is
 25 29 required to accept client referrals from the EDA as a condition
 25 30 of receiving a grant.  The division provides that the EDA may
 25 31 make client referrals to eligible providers.
 25 32    DIVISION IV ==== MISCELLANEOUS CHANGES.  Division IV makes
 25 33 several miscellaneous changes to other EDA programs.  The
 25 34 division amends the sales and use tax refund available under
 25 35 the workforce housing tax incentive program.  That refund
 26  1 is available for sales and use tax paid prior to project
 26  2 completion, which is currently defined to mean the first date
 26  3 upon which the average annualized production of finished
 26  4 product for the preceding 90=day period at the manufacturing
 26  5 facility operated by the eligible business is at least 50
 26  6 percent of the initial design capacity of the facility.  The
 26  7 division amends the definition of "project completion" to mean
 26  8 the date on which the EDA notifies the department of revenue
 26  9 that all applicable requirements of a workforce housing tax
 26 10 incentive program agreement are satisfied.  This provision
 26 11 takes effect upon enactment and applies retroactively to July
 26 12 1, 2014, for all workforce housing tax incentive agreements
 26 13 entered into on or after that date.
 26 14    The division allows the EDA to extend the project
 26 15 completion date for a project awarded tax incentives under the
 26 16 redevelopment tax credit program and the housing enterprise
 26 17 zone tax incentives program if the property that is the subject
 26 18 of the project suffered a catastrophic fire during the 2014
 26 19 calendar year.

 18 18 capital funds, and modifying the entrepreneur investment awards
 18 19 program.
 18 20    DIVISION I ==== RENEWABLE CHEMICAL PRODUCTION TAX CREDIT.
 18 21   Division I creates a renewable chemical production tax credit
 18 22 program (program) that will be administered by the EDA and that
 18 23 will provide tax credits to eligible businesses that produce
 18 24 renewable chemicals in Iowa from biomass feedstock.  "Renewable
 18 25 chemical", "biomass feedstock", and other related terms are
 18 26 defined in the division.
 18 27    In order to qualify for the tax credit, a business must
 18 28 meet several requirements.  First, the business must be
 18 29 physically located in Iowa and operated for profit under
 18 30 single management.  Second, the business must not be an
 18 31 entity providing professional services, health care services,
 18 32 or medical treatments, or be engaged primarily in retail
 18 33 operations.  Third, the business must have organized, expanded,
 18 34 or located in Iowa on or after the effective date of the
 18 35 division.  Fourth, the business must not be, in the discretion
 19  1 of the EDA, ineligible under certain provisions relating to the
 19  2 relocation or reduction of business operations within Iowa.
 19  3 Fifth, the business must be in compliance with all agreements
 19  4 entered into under the program or other programs administered
 19  5 by the EDA.
 19  6    An eligible business seeking a tax credit is required
 19  7 to apply to the EDA during the calendar year following the
 19  8 calendar year in which the renewable chemicals are produced.
 19  9 The application must include the amount of renewable chemicals
 19 10 produced in Iowa from biomass feedstock by the eligible
 19 11 business during the calendar year, measured in pounds, and any
 19 12 other information reasonably required by the EDA in order to
 19 13 establish and verify eligibility under the program.  The EDA
 19 14 may accept applications on a continuous basis or may establish
 19 15 an annual application deadline.
 19 16    Before being issued a tax credit, an eligible business
 19 17 is required to enter into an agreement with the EDA for the
 19 18 successful completion of all requirements of the program.  The
 19 19 EDA is authorized to impose two compliance cost fees under the
 19 20 program.  The first fee equals $500 per agreement.  The second
 19 21 fee equals 0.5 percent of the value of the tax credit claimed
 19 22 pursuant to the agreement if the agreement has an aggregate tax
 19 23 credit value of $100,000 or greater.
 19 24    An eligible business that fails to comply with the
 19 25 requirements of the program or the terms of an agreement with
 19 26 the EDA may have its tax credits reduced, terminated, or
 19 27 rescinded, and may be subject to the repayment or recapture of
 19 28 claimed tax credits.
 19 29    Upon determining that all requirements of an agreement and
 19 30 the program have been fulfilled, the EDA shall issue a tax
 19 31 credit and related tax credit certificate to the eligible
 19 32 business in an amount equal to the product of $.05 multiplied
 19 33 by the number of pounds of renewable chemicals produced in Iowa
 19 34 from biomass feedstock by the eligible business during the
 19 35 calendar year.  Renewable chemicals produced by an eligible
 20  1 business prior to the effective date of the division, or
 20  2 prior to the date the business first qualifies as an eligible
 20  3 business, or after calendar year 2025, shall not qualify for
 20  4 the tax credit.
 20  5    The tax credit shall be claimed for the tax year during
 20  6 which the eligible business was issued the tax credit.  The tax
 20  7 credit may be claimed against the individual income tax and the
 20  8 corporate income tax.  The credit is refundable or may, at the
 20  9 election of the taxpayer, be carried forward for up to one tax
 20 10 year.   The tax credit shall not be transferred to any person.  A
 20 11 tax credit issued to a partnership, limited liability company,
 20 12 S corporation, cooperative organized under Code chapter 501
 20 13 and filing as a partnership for federal tax purposes, estate,
 20 14 or trust electing to have the income taxed directly to the
 20 15 individual may be claimed by the individual based upon the pro
 20 16 rata share of the individual's earnings from that entity.
 20 17    The division provides that the program is subject to the
 20 18 EDA's maximum aggregate tax credit cap of $170 million per
 20 19 fiscal year in Code section 15.119, and not more than $15
 20 20 million per fiscal year may be issued by the EDA under the
 20 21 program.  In addition, the maximum amount of tax credit that
 20 22 may be issued to an eligible business in any one calendar year
 20 23 shall not exceed $1 million or $500,000, depending on whether
 20 24 the eligible business has been operating in Iowa at the time of
 20 25 application for five or fewer years, or more than five years,
 20 26 respectively.  An eligible business shall not receive more than
 20 27 five tax credits under the program.  The EDA is required to
 20 28 issue tax credits on a first=come, first=served basis until the
 20 29 maximum amount of $15 million per fiscal year is reached.  If
 20 30 the amount of tax credits exceeds this amount in a fiscal year,
 20 31 the EDA is required to establish a wait list and give priority
 20 32 in subsequent years to the eligible businesses on the wait
 20 33 list.
 20 34    The division provides for the confidentiality of certain
 20 35 information under the program.  The identity of a tax credit
 21  1 recipient and the amount of the tax credit shall be considered
 21  2 public information under Code chapter 22 (examination of public
 21  3 records), but any other information or record in the possession
 21  4 of the EDA with respect to the program shall be presumed by
 21  5 the EDA to be a trade secret protected under Code chapter 550
 21  6 or common law and shall be kept confidential by the EDA unless
 21  7 otherwise ordered by a court.
 21  8    The division takes effect upon enactment and applies to
 21  9 renewable chemicals produced in Iowa from biomass feedstock on
 21 10 or after that date.  The division applies retroactively to tax
 21 11 years beginning on or after January 1, 2015.
 21 12    DIVISION II ==== ANGEL INVESTOR TAX CREDITS.   Division II
 21 13 makes several changes to the tax credit for investments in
 21 14 qualifying businesses and community=based seed capital funds,
 21 15 often referred to as the angel investor tax credits.  The
 21 16 division amends the purpose of the tax credit in Code section
 21 17 15E.41.  The division excludes investments in community=based
 21 18 seed capital funds from qualifying for the tax credit and
 21 19 makes several conforming amendments to remove references to
 21 20 community=based seed capital funds from the Code.
 21 21    The division modifies the amount and dollar limitation of
 21 22 the tax credit for a taxpayer.  The tax credit is increased
 21 23 from 20 percent to 25 percent of a taxpayer's equity investment
 21 24 in a qualifying business.  Under current law, a taxpayer cannot
 21 25 claim more than $50,000 of tax credit per investment in a
 21 26 qualifying business, and for each tax year a taxpayer and the
 21 27 taxpayer's affiliates cannot claim tax credits for more than
 21 28 five investments in five different qualifying businesses.  The
 21 29 division amends this dollar limitation to prohibit a natural
 21 30 person and the person's spouse, child, or sibling from claiming
 21 31 a combined amount of more than $100,000 in tax credits per tax
 21 32 year.
 21 33    The division also provides that no more than $500,000 in tax
 21 34 credits may be issued per tax year for equity investments in
 21 35 any one qualifying business.
 22  1 The division modifies the procedures for claiming the tax
 22  2 credit.  Under current law, the tax credit is not refundable
 22  3 but available for carryforward for up to five tax years.  The
 22  4 division makes the tax credit refundable for an investment
 22  5 made by a natural person, and for any other person reduces the
 22  6 carryforward period to three years.
 22  7    The division strikes a provision permitting the EDA
 22  8 to cooperate with small business development centers to
 22  9 disseminate information regarding the credits and to develop
 22 10 standard application forms, and requiring the EDA to distribute
 22 11 copies of the application forms to all community=based seed
 22 12 capital funds and potential individual investors.
 22 13    The division modifies the eligibility requirements for
 22 14 qualifying businesses.  The division strikes the requirement
 22 15 that a business have an owner that meets at least one of
 22 16 four qualifications relating to business education or
 22 17 business experience.  The division requires that a business
 22 18 be participating in an entrepreneurial assistance program,
 22 19 as defined in the division, but allows the EDA to waive this
 22 20 requirement if the business establishes that its owners,
 22 21 directors, officers, and employees have an appropriate level
 22 22 of experience such that an entrepreneurial assistance program
 22 23 would not materially change the prospects of the business.
 22 24 The EDA is allowed to consult with outside service providers
 22 25 in considering such a waiver.  The division increases from $5
 22 26 million to $10 million the maximum amount of net worth that
 22 27 a business may have to be considered a qualifying business.
 22 28 The division increases from $250,000 to $500,000 the amount of
 22 29 financing that a business must have in order to be considered a
 22 30 qualifying business, removes "near equity" from the types of
 22 31 financing that will be considered in that calculation, requires
 22 32 that the financing be secured at the time of application for
 22 33 the tax credits, and requires that the business have at least
 22 34 two investors at the time of application for the tax credits.
 22 35 These modified eligibility requirements apply to businesses
 23  1 that submit an application to the EDA to be registered as a
 23  2 qualifying business on or after the effective date of this
 23  3 division of the bill, and businesses that submitted such an
 23  4 application to the EDA before the effective date of this
 23  5 division of the bill shall be governed by current law.
 23  6    The division provides for the confidentiality of certain
 23  7 information with regard to the tax credit.  The identity of
 23  8 a qualifying business, the identity of an investor and the
 23  9 qualifying business in which the investor made an equity
 23 10 investment, and the total number and amount of tax credits
 23 11 issued shall be considered public information under Code
 23 12 chapter 22 (examination of public records), but any other
 23 13 information or record in the possession of the EDA with respect
 23 14 to the program shall be presumed by the EDA to be a trade secret
 23 15 protected under Code chapter 550 or common law and shall be
 23 16 kept confidential by the EDA unless otherwise ordered by a
 23 17 court.
 23 18    The division takes effect upon enactment and applies to
 23 19 equity investments in a qualifying business made on or after
 23 20 that date.  Equity investments in a qualifying business or
 23 21 community=based seed capital fund made prior to the effective
 23 22 date of the division shall be governed by current law.
 23 23    DIVISION III ==== ENTREPRENEUR INVESTMENT AWARDS PROGRAM.
 23 24  Division III amends the entrepreneur investment awards program
 23 25 administered by the EDA.  The division strikes provisions that
 23 26 prohibited the EDA from making awards under the program since
 23 27 July 1, 2014, and that required the EDA by December 31, 2014,
 23 28 to conduct a comprehensive review of the program and submit
 23 29 a report with specified information to the governor and the
 23 30 general assembly.
 23 31    The division modifies the purpose of the program to be
 23 32 to provide financial assistance to eligible entrepreneurial
 23 33 assistance providers (provider) that provide technical and
 23 34 financial assistance to entrepreneurs and start=up companies
 23 35 seeking to create, locate, or expand a business in Iowa.
 24  1 "Financial assistance" is defined in the division.
 24  2    The division changes the requirements for receiving an
 24  3 award.  To be eligible to receive an award under current
 24  4 law, an entrepreneurial assistance program must have been
 24  5 an Iowa=based business, expended at least $500,000 during
 24  6 the previous fiscal year to provide technical and financial
 24  7 assistance services that meet the broad=based needs of
 24  8 entrepreneurs seeking to create, locate, or expand a business
 24  9 in Iowa that intends to derive more than 10 percent of its
 24 10 gross sales from markets outside Iowa; and must have engaged
 24 11 and communicated with certain other programs, funding sources,
 24 12 and entities for its entrepreneur clients.  The division
 24 13 amends the eligibility for receiving financial assistance to
 24 14 require that a provider have its principal place of operations
 24 15 in Iowa and that the provider offer a comprehensive set of
 24 16 business development services to emerging and early=stage
 24 17 innovation companies to assist in the creation, location,
 24 18 growth, and long=term success of the company in Iowa.
 24 19 "Business development services" is defined in the division.
 24 20 Business development services may be performed at the physical
 24 21 location of the provider or the company and may be provided in
 24 22 consideration of equity participation in the company, a fee for
 24 23 services, or a membership agreement with the company.
 24 24    Under current law, the EDA board could approve, deny, or
 24 25 defer each application for a grant, and was required to award
 24 26 grants on a first=come, first=served basis.  The division
 24 27 specifies that the EDA board has the discretion to approve,
 24 28 deny, or defer each application for financial assistance and
 24 29 that the amount of financial assistance awarded to a provider
 24 30 is within the discretion of the EDA.  The division requires
 24 31 the EDA to award financial assistance on a competitive basis
 24 32 and allows the EDA to develop scoring criteria and establish
 24 33 minimum requirements for the receipt of a financial assistance
 24 34 award.
 24 35    In addition to the four factors relating to the provider's
 25  1 professional staff that the EDA may consider under current
 25  2 law in deciding whether to award financial assistance, the
 25  3 division provides that the EDA may also consider the service
 25  4 model and likelihood of success of the provider, the provider's
 25  5 similarity to other successful providers in the country, and
 25  6 the provider's financial need.
 25  7    The division modifies the maximum award amount for a
 25  8 recipient.  Under current law, a grant to an entrepreneur
 25  9 assistance program cannot exceed the lesser of 25 percent of
 25 10 the funds expended by the program during the previous fiscal
 25 11 year, 100 percent of the funds raised from certain persons
 25 12 by the program during the previous fiscal year, or $200,000.
 25 13 The division provides that the amount of financial assistance
 25 14 awarded to any one provider shall not exceed $200,000.
 25 15    The division modifies the permitted use of funds received
 25 16 under the program.  Under current law, grants are only
 25 17 permitted to be used for the purpose of operating costs
 25 18 incurred by the program.  The division specifies that financial
 25 19 assistance awarded to a provider shall only be used for
 25 20 the purpose of operating costs incurred by the provider in
 25 21 the provision of business development services to emerging
 25 22 and early=stage innovation companies in Iowa.  The division
 25 23 further requires that such financial assistance shall not be
 25 24 distributed to owners or investors of the company to which the
 25 25 business development services are being provided and shall not
 25 26 be provided to other persons assisting with the provision of
 25 27 the services.
 25 28    Under current law, an entrepreneurial assistance provider is
 25 29 required to accept client referrals from the EDA as a condition
 25 30 of receiving a grant.  The division provides that the EDA may
 25 31 make client referrals to eligible providers.
 25 32    DIVISION IV ==== MISCELLANEOUS CHANGES.  Division IV makes
 25 33 several miscellaneous changes to other EDA programs.  The
 25 34 division amends the sales and use tax refund available under
 25 35 the workforce housing tax incentive program.  That refund
 26  1 is available for sales and use tax paid prior to project
 26  2 completion, which is currently defined to mean the first date
 26  3 upon which the average annualized production of finished
 26  4 product for the preceding 90=day period at the manufacturing
 26  5 facility operated by the eligible business is at least 50
 26  6 percent of the initial design capacity of the facility.  The
 26  7 division amends the definition of "project completion" to mean
 26  8 the date on which the EDA notifies the department of revenue
 26  9 that all applicable requirements of a workforce housing tax
 26 10 incentive program agreement are satisfied.  This provision
 26 11 takes effect upon enactment and applies retroactively to July
 26 12 1, 2014, for all workforce housing tax incentive agreements
 26 13 entered into on or after that date.
 26 14    The division allows the EDA to extend the project
 26 15 completion date for a project awarded tax incentives under the
 26 16 redevelopment tax credit program and the housing enterprise
 26 17 zone tax incentives program if the property that is the subject
 26 18 of the project suffered a catastrophic fire during the 2014
 26 19 calendar year.

 18 20    DIVISION I ==== RENEWABLE CHEMICAL PRODUCTION TAX CREDIT.
 18 21   Division I creates a renewable chemical production tax credit
 18 22 program (program) that will be administered by the EDA and that
 18 23 will provide tax credits to eligible businesses that produce
 18 24 renewable chemicals in Iowa from biomass feedstock.  "Renewable
 18 25 chemical", "biomass feedstock", and other related terms are
 18 26 defined in the division.
 18 27    In order to qualify for the tax credit, a business must
 18 28 meet several requirements.  First, the business must be
 18 29 physically located in Iowa and operated for profit under
 18 30 single management.  Second, the business must not be an
 18 31 entity providing professional services, health care services,
 18 32 or medical treatments, or be engaged primarily in retail
 18 33 operations.  Third, the business must have organized, expanded,
 18 34 or located in Iowa on or after the effective date of the
 18 35 division.  Fourth, the business must not be, in the discretion
 19  1 of the EDA, ineligible under certain provisions relating to the
 19  2 relocation or reduction of business operations within Iowa.
 19  3 Fifth, the business must be in compliance with all agreements
 19  4 entered into under the program or other programs administered
 19  5 by the EDA.
 19  6    An eligible business seeking a tax credit is required
 19  7 to apply to the EDA during the calendar year following the
 19  8 calendar year in which the renewable chemicals are produced.
 19  9 The application must include the amount of renewable chemicals
 19 10 produced in Iowa from biomass feedstock by the eligible
 19 11 business during the calendar year, measured in pounds, and any
 19 12 other information reasonably required by the EDA in order to
 19 13 establish and verify eligibility under the program.  The EDA
 19 14 may accept applications on a continuous basis or may establish
 19 15 an annual application deadline.
 19 16    Before being issued a tax credit, an eligible business
 19 17 is required to enter into an agreement with the EDA for the
 19 18 successful completion of all requirements of the program.  The
 19 19 EDA is authorized to impose two compliance cost fees under the
 19 20 program.  The first fee equals $500 per agreement.  The second
 19 21 fee equals 0.5 percent of the value of the tax credit claimed
 19 22 pursuant to the agreement if the agreement has an aggregate tax
 19 23 credit value of $100,000 or greater.
 19 24    An eligible business that fails to comply with the
 19 25 requirements of the program or the terms of an agreement with
 19 26 the EDA may have its tax credits reduced, terminated, or
 19 27 rescinded, and may be subject to the repayment or recapture of
 19 28 claimed tax credits.
 19 29    Upon determining that all requirements of an agreement and
 19 30 the program have been fulfilled, the EDA shall issue a tax
 19 31 credit and related tax credit certificate to the eligible
 19 32 business in an amount equal to the product of $.05 multiplied
 19 33 by the number of pounds of renewable chemicals produced in Iowa
 19 34 from biomass feedstock by the eligible business during the
 19 35 calendar year.  Renewable chemicals produced by an eligible
 20  1 business prior to the effective date of the division, or
 20  2 prior to the date the business first qualifies as an eligible
 20  3 business, or after calendar year 2025, shall not qualify for
 20  4 the tax credit.
 20  5    The tax credit shall be claimed for the tax year during
 20  6 which the eligible business was issued the tax credit.  The tax
 20  7 credit may be claimed against the individual income tax and the
 20  8 corporate income tax.  The credit is refundable or may, at the
 20  9 election of the taxpayer, be carried forward for up to one tax
 20 10 year.   The tax credit shall not be transferred to any person.  A
 20 11 tax credit issued to a partnership, limited liability company,
 20 12 S corporation, cooperative organized under Code chapter 501
 20 13 and filing as a partnership for federal tax purposes, estate,
 20 14 or trust electing to have the income taxed directly to the
 20 15 individual may be claimed by the individual based upon the pro
 20 16 rata share of the individual's earnings from that entity.
 20 17    The division provides that the program is subject to the
 20 18 EDA's maximum aggregate tax credit cap of $170 million per
 20 19 fiscal year in Code section 15.119, and not more than $15
 20 20 million per fiscal year may be issued by the EDA under the
 20 21 program.  In addition, the maximum amount of tax credit that
 20 22 may be issued to an eligible business in any one calendar year
 20 23 shall not exceed $1 million or $500,000, depending on whether
 20 24 the eligible business has been operating in Iowa at the time of
 20 25 application for five or fewer years, or more than five years,
 20 26 respectively.  An eligible business shall not receive more than
 20 27 five tax credits under the program.  The EDA is required to
 20 28 issue tax credits on a first=come, first=served basis until the
 20 29 maximum amount of $15 million per fiscal year is reached.  If
 20 30 the amount of tax credits exceeds this amount in a fiscal year,
 20 31 the EDA is required to establish a wait list and give priority
 20 32 in subsequent years to the eligible businesses on the wait
 20 33 list.
 20 34    The division provides for the confidentiality of certain
 20 35 information under the program.  The identity of a tax credit
 21  1 recipient and the amount of the tax credit shall be considered
 21  2 public information under Code chapter 22 (examination of public
 21  3 records), but any other information or record in the possession
 21  4 of the EDA with respect to the program shall be presumed by
 21  5 the EDA to be a trade secret protected under Code chapter 550
 21  6 or common law and shall be kept confidential by the EDA unless
 21  7 otherwise ordered by a court.
 21  8    The division takes effect upon enactment and applies to
 21  9 renewable chemicals produced in Iowa from biomass feedstock on
 21 10 or after that date.  The division applies retroactively to tax
 21 11 years beginning on or after January 1, 2015.
 21 12    DIVISION II ==== ANGEL INVESTOR TAX CREDITS.   Division II
 21 13 makes several changes to the tax credit for investments in
 21 14 qualifying businesses and community=based seed capital funds,
 21 15 often referred to as the angel investor tax credits.  The
 21 16 division amends the purpose of the tax credit in Code section
 21 17 15E.41.  The division excludes investments in community=based
 21 18 seed capital funds from qualifying for the tax credit and
 21 19 makes several conforming amendments to remove references to
 21 20 community=based seed capital funds from the Code.
 21 21    The division modifies the amount and dollar limitation of
 21 22 the tax credit for a taxpayer.  The tax credit is increased
 21 23 from 20 percent to 25 percent of a taxpayer's equity investment
 21 24 in a qualifying business.  Under current law, a taxpayer cannot
 21 25 claim more than $50,000 of tax credit per investment in a
 21 26 qualifying business, and for each tax year a taxpayer and the
 21 27 taxpayer's affiliates cannot claim tax credits for more than
 21 28 five investments in five different qualifying businesses.  The
 21 29 division amends this dollar limitation to prohibit a natural
 21 30 person and the person's spouse, child, or sibling from claiming
 21 31 a combined amount of more than $100,000 in tax credits per tax
 21 32 year.
 21 33    The division also provides that no more than $500,000 in tax
 21 34 credits may be issued per tax year for equity investments in
 21 35 any one qualifying business.
 22  1 The division modifies the procedures for claiming the tax
 22  2 credit.  Under current law, the tax credit is not refundable
 22  3 but available for carryforward for up to five tax years.  The
 22  4 division makes the tax credit refundable for an investment
 22  5 made by a natural person, and for any other person reduces the
 22  6 carryforward period to three years.
 22  7    The division strikes a provision permitting the EDA
 22  8 to cooperate with small business development centers to
 22  9 disseminate information regarding the credits and to develop
 22 10 standard application forms, and requiring the EDA to distribute
 22 11 copies of the application forms to all community=based seed
 22 12 capital funds and potential individual investors.
 22 13    The division modifies the eligibility requirements for
 22 14 qualifying businesses.  The division strikes the requirement
 22 15 that a business have an owner that meets at least one of
 22 16 four qualifications relating to business education or
 22 17 business experience.  The division requires that a business
 22 18 be participating in an entrepreneurial assistance program,
 22 19 as defined in the division, but allows the EDA to waive this
 22 20 requirement if the business establishes that its owners,
 22 21 directors, officers, and employees have an appropriate level
 22 22 of experience such that an entrepreneurial assistance program
 22 23 would not materially change the prospects of the business.
 22 24 The EDA is allowed to consult with outside service providers
 22 25 in considering such a waiver.  The division increases from $5
 22 26 million to $10 million the maximum amount of net worth that
 22 27 a business may have to be considered a qualifying business.
 22 28 The division increases from $250,000 to $500,000 the amount of
 22 29 financing that a business must have in order to be considered a
 22 30 qualifying business, removes "near equity" from the types of
 22 31 financing that will be considered in that calculation, requires
 22 32 that the financing be secured at the time of application for
 22 33 the tax credits, and requires that the business have at least
 22 34 two investors at the time of application for the tax credits.
 22 35 These modified eligibility requirements apply to businesses
 23  1 that submit an application to the EDA to be registered as a
 23  2 qualifying business on or after the effective date of this
 23  3 division of the bill, and businesses that submitted such an
 23  4 application to the EDA before the effective date of this
 23  5 division of the bill shall be governed by current law.
 23  6    The division provides for the confidentiality of certain
 23  7 information with regard to the tax credit.  The identity of
 23  8 a qualifying business, the identity of an investor and the
 23  9 qualifying business in which the investor made an equity
 23 10 investment, and the total number and amount of tax credits
 23 11 issued shall be considered public information under Code
 23 12 chapter 22 (examination of public records), but any other
 23 13 information or record in the possession of the EDA with respect
 23 14 to the program shall be presumed by the EDA to be a trade secret
 23 15 protected under Code chapter 550 or common law and shall be
 23 16 kept confidential by the EDA unless otherwise ordered by a
 23 17 court.
 23 18    The division takes effect upon enactment and applies to
 23 19 equity investments in a qualifying business made on or after
 23 20 that date.  Equity investments in a qualifying business or
 23 21 community=based seed capital fund made prior to the effective
 23 22 date of the division shall be governed by current law.
 23 23    DIVISION III ==== ENTREPRENEUR INVESTMENT AWARDS PROGRAM.
 23 24  Division III amends the entrepreneur investment awards program
 23 25 administered by the EDA.  The division strikes provisions that
 23 26 prohibited the EDA from making awards under the program since
 23 27 July 1, 2014, and that required the EDA by December 31, 2014,
 23 28 to conduct a comprehensive review of the program and submit
 23 29 a report with specified information to the governor and the
 23 30 general assembly.
 23 31    The division modifies the purpose of the program to be
 23 32 to provide financial assistance to eligible entrepreneurial
 23 33 assistance providers (provider) that provide technical and
 23 34 financial assistance to entrepreneurs and start=up companies
 23 35 seeking to create, locate, or expand a business in Iowa.
 24  1 "Financial assistance" is defined in the division.
 24  2    The division changes the requirements for receiving an
 24  3 award.  To be eligible to receive an award under current
 24  4 law, an entrepreneurial assistance program must have been
 24  5 an Iowa=based business, expended at least $500,000 during
 24  6 the previous fiscal year to provide technical and financial
 24  7 assistance services that meet the broad=based needs of
 24  8 entrepreneurs seeking to create, locate, or expand a business
 24  9 in Iowa that intends to derive more than 10 percent of its
 24 10 gross sales from markets outside Iowa; and must have engaged
 24 11 and communicated with certain other programs, funding sources,
 24 12 and entities for its entrepreneur clients.  The division
 24 13 amends the eligibility for receiving financial assistance to
 24 14 require that a provider have its principal place of operations
 24 15 in Iowa and that the provider offer a comprehensive set of
 24 16 business development services to emerging and early=stage
 24 17 innovation companies to assist in the creation, location,
 24 18 growth, and long=term success of the company in Iowa.
 24 19 "Business development services" is defined in the division.
 24 20 Business development services may be performed at the physical
 24 21 location of the provider or the company and may be provided in
 24 22 consideration of equity participation in the company, a fee for
 24 23 services, or a membership agreement with the company.
 24 24    Under current law, the EDA board could approve, deny, or
 24 25 defer each application for a grant, and was required to award
 24 26 grants on a first=come, first=served basis.  The division
 24 27 specifies that the EDA board has the discretion to approve,
 24 28 deny, or defer each application for financial assistance and
 24 29 that the amount of financial assistance awarded to a provider
 24 30 is within the discretion of the EDA.  The division requires
 24 31 the EDA to award financial assistance on a competitive basis
 24 32 and allows the EDA to develop scoring criteria and establish
 24 33 minimum requirements for the receipt of a financial assistance
 24 34 award.
 24 35    In addition to the four factors relating to the provider's
 25  1 professional staff that the EDA may consider under current
 25  2 law in deciding whether to award financial assistance, the
 25  3 division provides that the EDA may also consider the service
 25  4 model and likelihood of success of the provider, the provider's
 25  5 similarity to other successful providers in the country, and
 25  6 the provider's financial need.
 25  7    The division modifies the maximum award amount for a
 25  8 recipient.  Under current law, a grant to an entrepreneur
 25  9 assistance program cannot exceed the lesser of 25 percent of
 25 10 the funds expended by the program during the previous fiscal
 25 11 year, 100 percent of the funds raised from certain persons
 25 12 by the program during the previous fiscal year, or $200,000.
 25 13 The division provides that the amount of financial assistance
 25 14 awarded to any one provider shall not exceed $200,000.
 25 15    The division modifies the permitted use of funds received
 25 16 under the program.  Under current law, grants are only
 25 17 permitted to be used for the purpose of operating costs
 25 18 incurred by the program.  The division specifies that financial
 25 19 assistance awarded to a provider shall only be used for
 25 20 the purpose of operating costs incurred by the provider in
 25 21 the provision of business development services to emerging
 25 22 and early=stage innovation companies in Iowa.  The division
 25 23 further requires that such financial assistance shall not be
 25 24 distributed to owners or investors of the company to which the
 25 25 business development services are being provided and shall not
 25 26 be provided to other persons assisting with the provision of
 25 27 the services.
 25 28    Under current law, an entrepreneurial assistance provider is
 25 29 required to accept client referrals from the EDA as a condition
 25 30 of receiving a grant.  The division provides that the EDA may
 25 31 make client referrals to eligible providers.
 25 32    DIVISION IV ==== MISCELLANEOUS CHANGES.  Division IV makes
 25 33 several miscellaneous changes to other EDA programs.  The
 25 34 division amends the sales and use tax refund available under
 25 35 the workforce housing tax incentive program.  That refund
 26  1 is available for sales and use tax paid prior to project
 26  2 completion, which is currently defined to mean the first date
 26  3 upon which the average annualized production of finished
 26  4 product for the preceding 90=day period at the manufacturing
 26  5 facility operated by the eligible business is at least 50
 26  6 percent of the initial design capacity of the facility.  The
 26  7 division amends the definition of "project completion" to mean
 26  8 the date on which the EDA notifies the department of revenue
 26  9 that all applicable requirements of a workforce housing tax
 26 10 incentive program agreement are satisfied.  This provision
 26 11 takes effect upon enactment and applies retroactively to July
 26 12 1, 2014, for all workforce housing tax incentive agreements
 26 13 entered into on or after that date.
 26 14    The division allows the EDA to extend the project
 26 15 completion date for a project awarded tax incentives under the
 26 16 redevelopment tax credit program and the housing enterprise
 26 17 zone tax incentives program if the property that is the subject
 26 18 of the project suffered a catastrophic fire during the 2014
 26 19 calendar year.
       LSB 1212HV (3) 86
       mm/sc
 18 19 program.
 18 20    DIVISION I ==== RENEWABLE CHEMICAL PRODUCTION TAX CREDIT.
 18 21   Division I creates a renewable chemical production tax credit
 18 22 program (program) that will be administered by the EDA and that
 18 23 will provide tax credits to eligible businesses that produce
 18 24 renewable chemicals in Iowa from biomass feedstock.  "Renewable
 18 25 chemical", "biomass feedstock", and other related terms are
 18 26 defined in the division.
 18 27    In order to qualify for the tax credit, a business must
 18 28 meet several requirements.  First, the business must be
 18 29 physically located in Iowa and operated for profit under
 18 30 single management.  Second, the business must not be an
 18 31 entity providing professional services, health care services,
 18 32 or medical treatments, or be engaged primarily in retail
 18 33 operations.  Third, the business must have organized, expanded,
 18 34 or located in Iowa on or after the effective date of the
 18 35 division.  Fourth, the business must not be, in the discretion
 19  1 of the EDA, ineligible under certain provisions relating to the
 19  2 relocation or reduction of business operations within Iowa.
 19  3 Fifth, the business must be in compliance with all agreements
 19  4 entered into under the program or other programs administered
 19  5 by the EDA.
 19  6    An eligible business seeking a tax credit is required
 19  7 to apply to the EDA during the calendar year following the
 19  8 calendar year in which the renewable chemicals are produced.
 19  9 The application must include the amount of renewable chemicals
 19 10 produced in Iowa from biomass feedstock by the eligible
 19 11 business during the calendar year, measured in pounds, and any
 19 12 other information reasonably required by the EDA in order to
 19 13 establish and verify eligibility under the program.  The EDA
 19 14 may accept applications on a continuous basis or may establish
 19 15 an annual application deadline.
 19 16    Before being issued a tax credit, an eligible business
 19 17 is required to enter into an agreement with the EDA for the
 19 18 successful completion of all requirements of the program.  The
 19 19 EDA is authorized to impose two compliance cost fees under the
 19 20 program.  The first fee equals $500 per agreement.  The second
 19 21 fee equals 0.5 percent of the value of the tax credit claimed
 19 22 pursuant to the agreement if the agreement has an aggregate tax
 19 23 credit value of $100,000 or greater.
 19 24    An eligible business that fails to comply with the
 19 25 requirements of the program or the terms of an agreement with
 19 26 the EDA may have its tax credits reduced, terminated, or
 19 27 rescinded, and may be subject to the repayment or recapture of
 19 28 claimed tax credits.
 19 29    Upon determining that all requirements of an agreement and
 19 30 the program have been fulfilled, the EDA shall issue a tax
 19 31 credit and related tax credit certificate to the eligible
 19 32 business in an amount equal to the product of $.05 multiplied
 19 33 by the number of pounds of renewable chemicals produced in Iowa
 19 34 from biomass feedstock by the eligible business during the
 19 35 calendar year.  Renewable chemicals produced by an eligible
 20  1 business prior to the effective date of the division, or
 20  2 prior to the date the business first qualifies as an eligible
 20  3 business, or after calendar year 2025, shall not qualify for
 20  4 the tax credit.
 20  5    The tax credit shall be claimed for the tax year during
 20  6 which the eligible business was issued the tax credit.  The tax
 20  7 credit may be claimed against the individual income tax and the
 20  8 corporate income tax.  The credit is refundable or may, at the
 20  9 election of the taxpayer, be carried forward for up to one tax
 20 10 year.   The tax credit shall not be transferred to any person.  A
 20 11 tax credit issued to a partnership, limited liability company,
 20 12 S corporation, cooperative organized under Code chapter 501
 20 13 and filing as a partnership for federal tax purposes, estate,
 20 14 or trust electing to have the income taxed directly to the
 20 15 individual may be claimed by the individual based upon the pro
 20 16 rata share of the individual's earnings from that entity.
 20 17    The division provides that the program is subject to the
 20 18 EDA's maximum aggregate tax credit cap of $170 million per
 20 19 fiscal year in Code section 15.119, and not more than $15
 20 20 million per fiscal year may be issued by the EDA under the
 20 21 program.  In addition, the maximum amount of tax credit that
 20 22 may be issued to an eligible business in any one calendar year
 20 23 shall not exceed $1 million or $500,000, depending on whether
 20 24 the eligible business has been operating in Iowa at the time of
 20 25 application for five or fewer years, or more than five years,
 20 26 respectively.  An eligible business shall not receive more than
 20 27 five tax credits under the program.  The EDA is required to
 20 28 issue tax credits on a first=come, first=served basis until the
 20 29 maximum amount of $15 million per fiscal year is reached.  If
 20 30 the amount of tax credits exceeds this amount in a fiscal year,
 20 31 the EDA is required to establish a wait list and give priority
 20 32 in subsequent years to the eligible businesses on the wait
 20 33 list.
 20 34    The division provides for the confidentiality of certain
 20 35 information under the program.  The identity of a tax credit
 21  1 recipient and the amount of the tax credit shall be considered
 21  2 public information under Code chapter 22 (examination of public
 21  3 records), but any other information or record in the possession
 21  4 of the EDA with respect to the program shall be presumed by
 21  5 the EDA to be a trade secret protected under Code chapter 550
 21  6 or common law and shall be kept confidential by the EDA unless
 21  7 otherwise ordered by a court.
 21  8    The division takes effect upon enactment and applies to
 21  9 renewable chemicals produced in Iowa from biomass feedstock on
 21 10 or after that date.  The division applies retroactively to tax
 21 11 years beginning on or after January 1, 2015.
 21 12    DIVISION II ==== ANGEL INVESTOR TAX CREDITS.   Division II
 21 13 makes several changes to the tax credit for investments in
 21 14 qualifying businesses and community=based seed capital funds,
 21 15 often referred to as the angel investor tax credits.  The
 21 16 division amends the purpose of the tax credit in Code section
 21 17 15E.41.  The division excludes investments in community=based
 21 18 seed capital funds from qualifying for the tax credit and
 21 19 makes several conforming amendments to remove references to
 21 20 community=based seed capital funds from the Code.
 21 21    The division modifies the amount and dollar limitation of
 21 22 the tax credit for a taxpayer.  The tax credit is increased
 21 23 from 20 percent to 25 percent of a taxpayer's equity investment
 21 24 in a qualifying business.  Under current law, a taxpayer cannot
 21 25 claim more than $50,000 of tax credit per investment in a
 21 26 qualifying business, and for each tax year a taxpayer and the
 21 27 taxpayer's affiliates cannot claim tax credits for more than
 21 28 five investments in five different qualifying businesses.  The
 21 29 division amends this dollar limitation to prohibit a natural
 21 30 person and the person's spouse, child, or sibling from claiming
 21 31 a combined amount of more than $100,000 in tax credits per tax
 21 32 year.
 21 33    The division also provides that no more than $500,000 in tax
 21 34 credits may be issued per tax year for equity investments in
 21 35 any one qualifying business.
 22  1 The division modifies the procedures for claiming the tax
 22  2 credit.  Under current law, the tax credit is not refundable
 22  3 but available for carryforward for up to five tax years.  The
 22  4 division makes the tax credit refundable for an investment
 22  5 made by a natural person, and for any other person reduces the
 22  6 carryforward period to three years.
 22  7    The division strikes a provision permitting the EDA
 22  8 to cooperate with small business development centers to
 22  9 disseminate information regarding the credits and to develop
 22 10 standard application forms, and requiring the EDA to distribute
 22 11 copies of the application forms to all community=based seed
 22 12 capital funds and potential individual investors.
 22 13    The division modifies the eligibility requirements for
 22 14 qualifying businesses.  The division strikes the requirement
 22 15 that a business have an owner that meets at least one of
 22 16 four qualifications relating to business education or
 22 17 business experience.  The division requires that a business
 22 18 be participating in an entrepreneurial assistance program,
 22 19 as defined in the division, but allows the EDA to waive this
 22 20 requirement if the business establishes that its owners,
 22 21 directors, officers, and employees have an appropriate level
 22 22 of experience such that an entrepreneurial assistance program
 22 23 would not materially change the prospects of the business.
 22 24 The EDA is allowed to consult with outside service providers
 22 25 in considering such a waiver.  The division increases from $5
 22 26 million to $10 million the maximum amount of net worth that
 22 27 a business may have to be considered a qualifying business.
 22 28 The division increases from $250,000 to $500,000 the amount of
 22 29 financing that a business must have in order to be considered a
 22 30 qualifying business, removes "near equity" from the types of
 22 31 financing that will be considered in that calculation, requires
 22 32 that the financing be secured at the time of application for
 22 33 the tax credits, and requires that the business have at least
 22 34 two investors at the time of application for the tax credits.
 22 35 These modified eligibility requirements apply to businesses
 23  1 that submit an application to the EDA to be registered as a
 23  2 qualifying business on or after the effective date of this
 23  3 division of the bill, and businesses that submitted such an
 23  4 application to the EDA before the effective date of this
 23  5 division of the bill shall be governed by current law.
 23  6    The division provides for the confidentiality of certain
 23  7 information with regard to the tax credit.  The identity of
 23  8 a qualifying business, the identity of an investor and the
 23  9 qualifying business in which the investor made an equity
 23 10 investment, and the total number and amount of tax credits
 23 11 issued shall be considered public information under Code
 23 12 chapter 22 (examination of public records), but any other
 23 13 information or record in the possession of the EDA with respect
 23 14 to the program shall be presumed by the EDA to be a trade secret
 23 15 protected under Code chapter 550 or common law and shall be
 23 16 kept confidential by the EDA unless otherwise ordered by a
 23 17 court.
 23 18    The division takes effect upon enactment and applies to
 23 19 equity investments in a qualifying business made on or after
 23 20 that date.  Equity investments in a qualifying business or
 23 21 community=based seed capital fund made prior to the effective
 23 22 date of the division shall be governed by current law.
 23 23    DIVISION III ==== ENTREPRENEUR INVESTMENT AWARDS PROGRAM.
 23 24  Division III amends the entrepreneur investment awards program
 23 25 administered by the EDA.  The division strikes provisions that
 23 26 prohibited the EDA from making awards under the program since
 23 27 July 1, 2014, and that required the EDA by December 31, 2014,
 23 28 to conduct a comprehensive review of the program and submit
 23 29 a report with specified information to the governor and the
 23 30 general assembly.
 23 31    The division modifies the purpose of the program to be
 23 32 to provide financial assistance to eligible entrepreneurial
 23 33 assistance providers (provider) that provide technical and
 23 34 financial assistance to entrepreneurs and start=up companies
 23 35 seeking to create, locate, or expand a business in Iowa.
 24  1 "Financial assistance" is defined in the division.
 24  2    The division changes the requirements for receiving an
 24  3 award.  To be eligible to receive an award under current
 24  4 law, an entrepreneurial assistance program must have been
 24  5 an Iowa=based business, expended at least $500,000 during
 24  6 the previous fiscal year to provide technical and financial
 24  7 assistance services that meet the broad=based needs of
 24  8 entrepreneurs seeking to create, locate, or expand a business
 24  9 in Iowa that intends to derive more than 10 percent of its
 24 10 gross sales from markets outside Iowa; and must have engaged
 24 11 and communicated with certain other programs, funding sources,
 24 12 and entities for its entrepreneur clients.  The division
 24 13 amends the eligibility for receiving financial assistance to
 24 14 require that a provider have its principal place of operations
 24 15 in Iowa and that the provider offer a comprehensive set of
 24 16 business development services to emerging and early=stage
 24 17 innovation companies to assist in the creation, location,
 24 18 growth, and long=term success of the company in Iowa.
 24 19 "Business development services" is defined in the division.
 24 20 Business development services may be performed at the physical
 24 21 location of the provider or the company and may be provided in
 24 22 consideration of equity participation in the company, a fee for
 24 23 services, or a membership agreement with the company.
 24 24    Under current law, the EDA board could approve, deny, or
 24 25 defer each application for a grant, and was required to award
 24 26 grants on a first=come, first=served basis.  The division
 24 27 specifies that the EDA board has the discretion to approve,
 24 28 deny, or defer each application for financial assistance and
 24 29 that the amount of financial assistance awarded to a provider
 24 30 is within the discretion of the EDA.  The division requires
 24 31 the EDA to award financial assistance on a competitive basis
 24 32 and allows the EDA to develop scoring criteria and establish
 24 33 minimum requirements for the receipt of a financial assistance
 24 34 award.
 24 35    In addition to the four factors relating to the provider's
 25  1 professional staff that the EDA may consider under current
 25  2 law in deciding whether to award financial assistance, the
 25  3 division provides that the EDA may also consider the service
 25  4 model and likelihood of success of the provider, the provider's
 25  5 similarity to other successful providers in the country, and
 25  6 the provider's financial need.
 25  7    The division modifies the maximum award amount for a
 25  8 recipient.  Under current law, a grant to an entrepreneur
 25  9 assistance program cannot exceed the lesser of 25 percent of
 25 10 the funds expended by the program during the previous fiscal
 25 11 year, 100 percent of the funds raised from certain persons
 25 12 by the program during the previous fiscal year, or $200,000.
 25 13 The division provides that the amount of financial assistance
 25 14 awarded to any one provider shall not exceed $200,000.
 25 15    The division modifies the permitted use of funds received
 25 16 under the program.  Under current law, grants are only
 25 17 permitted to be used for the purpose of operating costs
 25 18 incurred by the program.  The division specifies that financial
 25 19 assistance awarded to a provider shall only be used for
 25 20 the purpose of operating costs incurred by the provider in
 25 21 the provision of business development services to emerging
 25 22 and early=stage innovation companies in Iowa.  The division
 25 23 further requires that such financial assistance shall not be
 25 24 distributed to owners or investors of the company to which the
 25 25 business development services are being provided and shall not
 25 26 be provided to other persons assisting with the provision of
 25 27 the services.
 25 28    Under current law, an entrepreneurial assistance provider is
 25 29 required to accept client referrals from the EDA as a condition
 25 30 of receiving a grant.  The division provides that the EDA may
 25 31 make client referrals to eligible providers.
 25 32    DIVISION IV ==== MISCELLANEOUS CHANGES.  Division IV makes
 25 33 several miscellaneous changes to other EDA programs.  The
 25 34 division amends the sales and use tax refund available under
 25 35 the workforce housing tax incentive program.  That refund
 26  1 is available for sales and use tax paid prior to project
 26  2 completion, which is currently defined to mean the first date
 26  3 upon which the average annualized production of finished
 26  4 product for the preceding 90=day period at the manufacturing
 26  5 facility operated by the eligible business is at least 50
 26  6 percent of the initial design capacity of the facility.  The
 26  7 division amends the definition of "project completion" to mean
 26  8 the date on which the EDA notifies the department of revenue
 26  9 that all applicable requirements of a workforce housing tax
 26 10 incentive program agreement are satisfied.  This provision
 26 11 takes effect upon enactment and applies retroactively to July
 26 12 1, 2014, for all workforce housing tax incentive agreements
 26 13 entered into on or after that date.
 26 14    The division allows the EDA to extend the project
 26 15 completion date for a project awarded tax incentives under the
 26 16 redevelopment tax credit program and the housing enterprise
 26 17 zone tax incentives program if the property that is the subject
 26 18 of the project suffered a catastrophic fire during the 2014
 26 19 calendar year.

 18 20    DIVISION I ==== RENEWABLE CHEMICAL PRODUCTION TAX CREDIT.
 18 21   Division I creates a renewable chemical production tax credit
 18 22 program (program) that will be administered by the EDA and that
 18 23 will provide tax credits to eligible businesses that produce
 18 24 renewable chemicals in Iowa from biomass feedstock.  "Renewable
 18 25 chemical", "biomass feedstock", and other related terms are
 18 26 defined in the division.
 18 27    In order to qualify for the tax credit, a business must
 18 28 meet several requirements.  First, the business must be
 18 29 physically located in Iowa and operated for profit under
 18 30 single management.  Second, the business must not be an
 18 31 entity providing professional services, health care services,
 18 32 or medical treatments, or be engaged primarily in retail
 18 33 operations.  Third, the business must have organized, expanded,
 18 34 or located in Iowa on or after the effective date of the
 18 35 division.  Fourth, the business must not be, in the discretion
 19  1 of the EDA, ineligible under certain provisions relating to the
 19  2 relocation or reduction of business operations within Iowa.
 19  3 Fifth, the business must be in compliance with all agreements
 19  4 entered into under the program or other programs administered
 19  5 by the EDA.
 19  6    An eligible business seeking a tax credit is required
 19  7 to apply to the EDA during the calendar year following the
 19  8 calendar year in which the renewable chemicals are produced.
 19  9 The application must include the amount of renewable chemicals
 19 10 produced in Iowa from biomass feedstock by the eligible
 19 11 business during the calendar year, measured in pounds, and any
 19 12 other information reasonably required by the EDA in order to
 19 13 establish and verify eligibility under the program.  The EDA
 19 14 may accept applications on a continuous basis or may establish
 19 15 an annual application deadline.
 19 16    Before being issued a tax credit, an eligible business
 19 17 is required to enter into an agreement with the EDA for the
 19 18 successful completion of all requirements of the program.  The
 19 19 EDA is authorized to impose two compliance cost fees under the
 19 20 program.  The first fee equals $500 per agreement.  The second
 19 21 fee equals 0.5 percent of the value of the tax credit claimed
 19 22 pursuant to the agreement if the agreement has an aggregate tax
 19 23 credit value of $100,000 or greater.
 19 24    An eligible business that fails to comply with the
 19 25 requirements of the program or the terms of an agreement with
 19 26 the EDA may have its tax credits reduced, terminated, or
 19 27 rescinded, and may be subject to the repayment or recapture of
 19 28 claimed tax credits.
 19 29    Upon determining that all requirements of an agreement and
 19 30 the program have been fulfilled, the EDA shall issue a tax
 19 31 credit and related tax credit certificate to the eligible
 19 32 business in an amount equal to the product of $.05 multiplied
 19 33 by the number of pounds of renewable chemicals produced in Iowa
 19 34 from biomass feedstock by the eligible business during the
 19 35 calendar year.  Renewable chemicals produced by an eligible
 20  1 business prior to the effective date of the division, or
 20  2 prior to the date the business first qualifies as an eligible
 20  3 business, or after calendar year 2025, shall not qualify for
 20  4 the tax credit.
 20  5    The tax credit shall be claimed for the tax year during
 20  6 which the eligible business was issued the tax credit.  The tax
 20  7 credit may be claimed against the individual income tax and the
 20  8 corporate income tax.  The credit is refundable or may, at the
 20  9 election of the taxpayer, be carried forward for up to one tax
 20 10 year.   The tax credit shall not be transferred to any person.  A
 20 11 tax credit issued to a partnership, limited liability company,
 20 12 S corporation, cooperative organized under Code chapter 501
 20 13 and filing as a partnership for federal tax purposes, estate,
 20 14 or trust electing to have the income taxed directly to the
 20 15 individual may be claimed by the individual based upon the pro
 20 16 rata share of the individual's earnings from that entity.
 20 17    The division provides that the program is subject to the
 20 18 EDA's maximum aggregate tax credit cap of $170 million per
 20 19 fiscal year in Code section 15.119, and not more than $15
 20 20 million per fiscal year may be issued by the EDA under the
 20 21 program.  In addition, the maximum amount of tax credit that
 20 22 may be issued to an eligible business in any one calendar year
 20 23 shall not exceed $1 million or $500,000, depending on whether
 20 24 the eligible business has been operating in Iowa at the time of
 20 25 application for five or fewer years, or more than five years,
 20 26 respectively.  An eligible business shall not receive more than
 20 27 five tax credits under the program.  The EDA is required to
 20 28 issue tax credits on a first=come, first=served basis until the
 20 29 maximum amount of $15 million per fiscal year is reached.  If
 20 30 the amount of tax credits exceeds this amount in a fiscal year,
 20 31 the EDA is required to establish a wait list and give priority
 20 32 in subsequent years to the eligible businesses on the wait
 20 33 list.
 20 34    The division provides for the confidentiality of certain
 20 35 information under the program.  The identity of a tax credit
 21  1 recipient and the amount of the tax credit shall be considered
 21  2 public information under Code chapter 22 (examination of public
 21  3 records), but any other information or record in the possession
 21  4 of the EDA with respect to the program shall be presumed by
 21  5 the EDA to be a trade secret protected under Code chapter 550
 21  6 or common law and shall be kept confidential by the EDA unless
 21  7 otherwise ordered by a court.
 21  8    The division takes effect upon enactment and applies to
 21  9 renewable chemicals produced in Iowa from biomass feedstock on
 21 10 or after that date.  The division applies retroactively to tax
 21 11 years beginning on or after January 1, 2015.
 21 12    DIVISION II ==== ANGEL INVESTOR TAX CREDITS.   Division II
 21 13 makes several changes to the tax credit for investments in
 21 14 qualifying businesses and community=based seed capital funds,
 21 15 often referred to as the angel investor tax credits.  The
 21 16 division amends the purpose of the tax credit in Code section
 21 17 15E.41.  The division excludes investments in community=based
 21 18 seed capital funds from qualifying for the tax credit and
 21 19 makes several conforming amendments to remove references to
 21 20 community=based seed capital funds from the Code.
 21 21    The division modifies the amount and dollar limitation of
 21 22 the tax credit for a taxpayer.  The tax credit is increased
 21 23 from 20 percent to 25 percent of a taxpayer's equity investment
 21 24 in a qualifying business.  Under current law, a taxpayer cannot
 21 25 claim more than $50,000 of tax credit per investment in a
 21 26 qualifying business, and for each tax year a taxpayer and the
 21 27 taxpayer's affiliates cannot claim tax credits for more than
 21 28 five investments in five different qualifying businesses.  The
 21 29 division amends this dollar limitation to prohibit a natural
 21 30 person and the person's spouse, child, or sibling from claiming
 21 31 a combined amount of more than $100,000 in tax credits per tax
 21 32 year.
 21 33    The division also provides that no more than $500,000 in tax
 21 34 credits may be issued per tax year for equity investments in
 21 35 any one qualifying business.
 22  1 The division modifies the procedures for claiming the tax
 22  2 credit.  Under current law, the tax credit is not refundable
 22  3 but available for carryforward for up to five tax years.  The
 22  4 division makes the tax credit refundable for an investment
 22  5 made by a natural person, and for any other person reduces the
 22  6 carryforward period to three years.
 22  7    The division strikes a provision permitting the EDA
 22  8 to cooperate with small business development centers to
 22  9 disseminate information regarding the credits and to develop
 22 10 standard application forms, and requiring the EDA to distribute
 22 11 copies of the application forms to all community=based seed
 22 12 capital funds and potential individual investors.
 22 13    The division modifies the eligibility requirements for
 22 14 qualifying businesses.  The division strikes the requirement
 22 15 that a business have an owner that meets at least one of
 22 16 four qualifications relating to business education or
 22 17 business experience.  The division requires that a business
 22 18 be participating in an entrepreneurial assistance program,
 22 19 as defined in the division, but allows the EDA to waive this
 22 20 requirement if the business establishes that its owners,
 22 21 directors, officers, and employees have an appropriate level
 22 22 of experience such that an entrepreneurial assistance program
 22 23 would not materially change the prospects of the business.
 22 24 The EDA is allowed to consult with outside service providers
 22 25 in considering such a waiver.  The division increases from $5
 22 26 million to $10 million the maximum amount of net worth that
 22 27 a business may have to be considered a qualifying business.
 22 28 The division increases from $250,000 to $500,000 the amount of
 22 29 financing that a business must have in order to be considered a
 22 30 qualifying business, removes "near equity" from the types of
 22 31 financing that will be considered in that calculation, requires
 22 32 that the financing be secured at the time of application for
 22 33 the tax credits, and requires that the business have at least
 22 34 two investors at the time of application for the tax credits.
 22 35 These modified eligibility requirements apply to businesses
 23  1 that submit an application to the EDA to be registered as a
 23  2 qualifying business on or after the effective date of this
 23  3 division of the bill, and businesses that submitted such an
 23  4 application to the EDA before the effective date of this
 23  5 division of the bill shall be governed by current law.
 23  6    The division provides for the confidentiality of certain
 23  7 information with regard to the tax credit.  The identity of
 23  8 a qualifying business, the identity of an investor and the
 23  9 qualifying business in which the investor made an equity
 23 10 investment, and the total number and amount of tax credits
 23 11 issued shall be considered public information under Code
 23 12 chapter 22 (examination of public records), but any other
 23 13 information or record in the possession of the EDA with respect
 23 14 to the program shall be presumed by the EDA to be a trade secret
 23 15 protected under Code chapter 550 or common law and shall be
 23 16 kept confidential by the EDA unless otherwise ordered by a
 23 17 court.
 23 18    The division takes effect upon enactment and applies to
 23 19 equity investments in a qualifying business made on or after
 23 20 that date.  Equity investments in a qualifying business or
 23 21 community=based seed capital fund made prior to the effective
 23 22 date of the division shall be governed by current law.
 23 23    DIVISION III ==== ENTREPRENEUR INVESTMENT AWARDS PROGRAM.
 23 24  Division III amends the entrepreneur investment awards program
 23 25 administered by the EDA.  The division strikes provisions that
 23 26 prohibited the EDA from making awards under the program since
 23 27 July 1, 2014, and that required the EDA by December 31, 2014,
 23 28 to conduct a comprehensive review of the program and submit
 23 29 a report with specified information to the governor and the
 23 30 general assembly.
 23 31    The division modifies the purpose of the program to be
 23 32 to provide financial assistance to eligible entrepreneurial
 23 33 assistance providers (provider) that provide technical and
 23 34 financial assistance to entrepreneurs and start=up companies
 23 35 seeking to create, locate, or expand a business in Iowa.
 24  1 "Financial assistance" is defined in the division.
 24  2    The division changes the requirements for receiving an
 24  3 award.  To be eligible to receive an award under current
 24  4 law, an entrepreneurial assistance program must have been
 24  5 an Iowa=based business, expended at least $500,000 during
 24  6 the previous fiscal year to provide technical and financial
 24  7 assistance services that meet the broad=based needs of
 24  8 entrepreneurs seeking to create, locate, or expand a business
 24  9 in Iowa that intends to derive more than 10 percent of its
 24 10 gross sales from markets outside Iowa; and must have engaged
 24 11 and communicated with certain other programs, funding sources,
 24 12 and entities for its entrepreneur clients.  The division
 24 13 amends the eligibility for receiving financial assistance to
 24 14 require that a provider have its principal place of operations
 24 15 in Iowa and that the provider offer a comprehensive set of
 24 16 business development services to emerging and early=stage
 24 17 innovation companies to assist in the creation, location,
 24 18 growth, and long=term success of the company in Iowa.
 24 19 "Business development services" is defined in the division.
 24 20 Business development services may be performed at the physical
 24 21 location of the provider or the company and may be provided in
 24 22 consideration of equity participation in the company, a fee for
 24 23 services, or a membership agreement with the company.
 24 24    Under current law, the EDA board could approve, deny, or
 24 25 defer each application for a grant, and was required to award
 24 26 grants on a first=come, first=served basis.  The division
 24 27 specifies that the EDA board has the discretion to approve,
 24 28 deny, or defer each application for financial assistance and
 24 29 that the amount of financial assistance awarded to a provider
 24 30 is within the discretion of the EDA.  The division requires
 24 31 the EDA to award financial assistance on a competitive basis
 24 32 and allows the EDA to develop scoring criteria and establish
 24 33 minimum requirements for the receipt of a financial assistance
 24 34 award.
 24 35    In addition to the four factors relating to the provider's
 25  1 professional staff that the EDA may consider under current
 25  2 law in deciding whether to award financial assistance, the
 25  3 division provides that the EDA may also consider the service
 25  4 model and likelihood of success of the provider, the provider's
 25  5 similarity to other successful providers in the country, and
 25  6 the provider's financial need.
 25  7    The division modifies the maximum award amount for a
 25  8 recipient.  Under current law, a grant to an entrepreneur
 25  9 assistance program cannot exceed the lesser of 25 percent of
 25 10 the funds expended by the program during the previous fiscal
 25 11 year, 100 percent of the funds raised from certain persons
 25 12 by the program during the previous fiscal year, or $200,000.
 25 13 The division provides that the amount of financial assistance
 25 14 awarded to any one provider shall not exceed $200,000.
 25 15    The division modifies the permitted use of funds received
 25 16 under the program.  Under current law, grants are only
 25 17 permitted to be used for the purpose of operating costs
 25 18 incurred by the program.  The division specifies that financial
 25 19 assistance awarded to a provider shall only be used for
 25 20 the purpose of operating costs incurred by the provider in
 25 21 the provision of business development services to emerging
 25 22 and early=stage innovation companies in Iowa.  The division
 25 23 further requires that such financial assistance shall not be
 25 24 distributed to owners or investors of the company to which the
 25 25 business development services are being provided and shall not
 25 26 be provided to other persons assisting with the provision of
 25 27 the services.
 25 28    Under current law, an entrepreneurial assistance provider is
 25 29 required to accept client referrals from the EDA as a condition
 25 30 of receiving a grant.  The division provides that the EDA may
 25 31 make client referrals to eligible providers.
 25 32    DIVISION IV ==== MISCELLANEOUS CHANGES.  Division IV makes
 25 33 several miscellaneous changes to other EDA programs.  The
 25 34 division amends the sales and use tax refund available under
 25 35 the workforce housing tax incentive program.  That refund
 26  1 is available for sales and use tax paid prior to project
 26  2 completion, which is currently defined to mean the first date
 26  3 upon which the average annualized production of finished
 26  4 product for the preceding 90=day period at the manufacturing
 26  5 facility operated by the eligible business is at least 50
 26  6 percent of the initial design capacity of the facility.  The
 26  7 division amends the definition of "project completion" to mean
 26  8 the date on which the EDA notifies the department of revenue
 26  9 that all applicable requirements of a workforce housing tax
 26 10 incentive program agreement are satisfied.  This provision
 26 11 takes effect upon enactment and applies retroactively to July
 26 12 1, 2014, for all workforce housing tax incentive agreements
 26 13 entered into on or after that date.
 26 14    The division allows the EDA to extend the project
 26 15 completion date for a project awarded tax incentives under the
 26 16 redevelopment tax credit program and the housing enterprise
 26 17 zone tax incentives program if the property that is the subject
 26 18 of the project suffered a catastrophic fire during the 2014
 26 19 calendar year.
       LSB 1212HV (3) 86
       mm/sc
 18 21   Division I creates a renewable chemical production tax credit
 18 22 program (program) that will be administered by the EDA and that
 18 23 will provide tax credits to eligible businesses that produce
 18 24 renewable chemicals in Iowa from biomass feedstock.  "Renewable
 18 25 chemical", "biomass feedstock", and other related terms are
 18 26 defined in the division.
 18 27    In order to qualify for the tax credit, a business must
 18 28 meet several requirements.  First, the business must be
 18 29 physically located in Iowa and operated for profit under
 18 30 single management.  Second, the business must not be an
 18 31 entity providing professional services, health care services,
 18 32 or medical treatments, or be engaged primarily in retail
 18 33 operations.  Third, the business must have organized, expanded,
 18 34 or located in Iowa on or after the effective date of the
 18 35 division.  Fourth, the business must not be, in the discretion
 19  1 of the EDA, ineligible under certain provisions relating to the
 19  2 relocation or reduction of business operations within Iowa.
 19  3 Fifth, the business must be in compliance with all agreements
 19  4 entered into under the program or other programs administered
 19  5 by the EDA.
 19  6    An eligible business seeking a tax credit is required
 19  7 to apply to the EDA during the calendar year following the
 19  8 calendar year in which the renewable chemicals are produced.
 19  9 The application must include the amount of renewable chemicals
 19 10 produced in Iowa from biomass feedstock by the eligible
 19 11 business during the calendar year, measured in pounds, and any
 19 12 other information reasonably required by the EDA in order to
 19 13 establish and verify eligibility under the program.  The EDA
 19 14 may accept applications on a continuous basis or may establish
 19 15 an annual application deadline.
 19 16    Before being issued a tax credit, an eligible business
 19 17 is required to enter into an agreement with the EDA for the
 19 18 successful completion of all requirements of the program.  The
 19 19 EDA is authorized to impose two compliance cost fees under the
 19 20 program.  The first fee equals $500 per agreement.  The second
 19 21 fee equals 0.5 percent of the value of the tax credit claimed
 19 22 pursuant to the agreement if the agreement has an aggregate tax
 19 23 credit value of $100,000 or greater.
 19 24    An eligible business that fails to comply with the
 19 25 requirements of the program or the terms of an agreement with
 19 26 the EDA may have its tax credits reduced, terminated, or
 19 27 rescinded, and may be subject to the repayment or recapture of
 19 28 claimed tax credits.
 19 29    Upon determining that all requirements of an agreement and
 19 30 the program have been fulfilled, the EDA shall issue a tax
 19 31 credit and related tax credit certificate to the eligible
 19 32 business in an amount equal to the product of $.05 multiplied
 19 33 by the number of pounds of renewable chemicals produced in Iowa
 19 34 from biomass feedstock by the eligible business during the
 19 35 calendar year.  Renewable chemicals produced by an eligible
 20  1 business prior to the effective date of the division, or
 20  2 prior to the date the business first qualifies as an eligible
 20  3 business, or after calendar year 2025, shall not qualify for
 20  4 the tax credit.
 20  5    The tax credit shall be claimed for the tax year during
 20  6 which the eligible business was issued the tax credit.  The tax
 20  7 credit may be claimed against the individual income tax and the
 20  8 corporate income tax.  The credit is refundable or may, at the
 20  9 election of the taxpayer, be carried forward for up to one tax
 20 10 year.   The tax credit shall not be transferred to any person.  A
 20 11 tax credit issued to a partnership, limited liability company,
 20 12 S corporation, cooperative organized under Code chapter 501
 20 13 and filing as a partnership for federal tax purposes, estate,
 20 14 or trust electing to have the income taxed directly to the
 20 15 individual may be claimed by the individual based upon the pro
 20 16 rata share of the individual's earnings from that entity.
 20 17    The division provides that the program is subject to the
 20 18 EDA's maximum aggregate tax credit cap of $170 million per
 20 19 fiscal year in Code section 15.119, and not more than $15
 20 20 million per fiscal year may be issued by the EDA under the
 20 21 program.  In addition, the maximum amount of tax credit that
 20 22 may be issued to an eligible business in any one calendar year
 20 23 shall not exceed $1 million or $500,000, depending on whether
 20 24 the eligible business has been operating in Iowa at the time of
 20 25 application for five or fewer years, or more than five years,
 20 26 respectively.  An eligible business shall not receive more than
 20 27 five tax credits under the program.  The EDA is required to
 20 28 issue tax credits on a first=come, first=served basis until the
 20 29 maximum amount of $15 million per fiscal year is reached.  If
 20 30 the amount of tax credits exceeds this amount in a fiscal year,
 20 31 the EDA is required to establish a wait list and give priority
 20 32 in subsequent years to the eligible businesses on the wait
 20 33 list.
 20 34    The division provides for the confidentiality of certain
 20 35 information under the program.  The identity of a tax credit
 21  1 recipient and the amount of the tax credit shall be considered
 21  2 public information under Code chapter 22 (examination of public
 21  3 records), but any other information or record in the possession
 21  4 of the EDA with respect to the program shall be presumed by
 21  5 the EDA to be a trade secret protected under Code chapter 550
 21  6 or common law and shall be kept confidential by the EDA unless
 21  7 otherwise ordered by a court.
 21  8    The division takes effect upon enactment and applies to
 21  9 renewable chemicals produced in Iowa from biomass feedstock on
 21 10 or after that date.  The division applies retroactively to tax
 21 11 years beginning on or after January 1, 2015.
 21 12    DIVISION II ==== ANGEL INVESTOR TAX CREDITS.   Division II
 21 13 makes several changes to the tax credit for investments in
 21 14 qualifying businesses and community=based seed capital funds,
 21 15 often referred to as the angel investor tax credits.  The
 21 16 division amends the purpose of the tax credit in Code section
 21 17 15E.41.  The division excludes investments in community=based
 21 18 seed capital funds from qualifying for the tax credit and
 21 19 makes several conforming amendments to remove references to
 21 20 community=based seed capital funds from the Code.
 21 21    The division modifies the amount and dollar limitation of
 21 22 the tax credit for a taxpayer.  The tax credit is increased
 21 23 from 20 percent to 25 percent of a taxpayer's equity investment
 21 24 in a qualifying business.  Under current law, a taxpayer cannot
 21 25 claim more than $50,000 of tax credit per investment in a
 21 26 qualifying business, and for each tax year a taxpayer and the
 21 27 taxpayer's affiliates cannot claim tax credits for more than
 21 28 five investments in five different qualifying businesses.  The
 21 29 division amends this dollar limitation to prohibit a natural
 21 30 person and the person's spouse, child, or sibling from claiming
 21 31 a combined amount of more than $100,000 in tax credits per tax
 21 32 year.
 21 33    The division also provides that no more than $500,000 in tax
 21 34 credits may be issued per tax year for equity investments in
 21 35 any one qualifying business.
 22  1 The division modifies the procedures for claiming the tax
 22  2 credit.  Under current law, the tax credit is not refundable
 22  3 but available for carryforward for up to five tax years.  The
 22  4 division makes the tax credit refundable for an investment
 22  5 made by a natural person, and for any other person reduces the
 22  6 carryforward period to three years.
 22  7    The division strikes a provision permitting the EDA
 22  8 to cooperate with small business development centers to
 22  9 disseminate information regarding the credits and to develop
 22 10 standard application forms, and requiring the EDA to distribute
 22 11 copies of the application forms to all community=based seed
 22 12 capital funds and potential individual investors.
 22 13    The division modifies the eligibility requirements for
 22 14 qualifying businesses.  The division strikes the requirement
 22 15 that a business have an owner that meets at least one of
 22 16 four qualifications relating to business education or
 22 17 business experience.  The division requires that a business
 22 18 be participating in an entrepreneurial assistance program,
 22 19 as defined in the division, but allows the EDA to waive this
 22 20 requirement if the business establishes that its owners,
 22 21 directors, officers, and employees have an appropriate level
 22 22 of experience such that an entrepreneurial assistance program
 22 23 would not materially change the prospects of the business.
 22 24 The EDA is allowed to consult with outside service providers
 22 25 in considering such a waiver.  The division increases from $5
 22 26 million to $10 million the maximum amount of net worth that
 22 27 a business may have to be considered a qualifying business.
 22 28 The division increases from $250,000 to $500,000 the amount of
 22 29 financing that a business must have in order to be considered a
 22 30 qualifying business, removes "near equity" from the types of
 22 31 financing that will be considered in that calculation, requires
 22 32 that the financing be secured at the time of application for
 22 33 the tax credits, and requires that the business have at least
 22 34 two investors at the time of application for the tax credits.
 22 35 These modified eligibility requirements apply to businesses
 23  1 that submit an application to the EDA to be registered as a
 23  2 qualifying business on or after the effective date of this
 23  3 division of the bill, and businesses that submitted such an
 23  4 application to the EDA before the effective date of this
 23  5 division of the bill shall be governed by current law.
 23  6    The division provides for the confidentiality of certain
 23  7 information with regard to the tax credit.  The identity of
 23  8 a qualifying business, the identity of an investor and the
 23  9 qualifying business in which the investor made an equity
 23 10 investment, and the total number and amount of tax credits
 23 11 issued shall be considered public information under Code
 23 12 chapter 22 (examination of public records), but any other
 23 13 information or record in the possession of the EDA with respect
 23 14 to the program shall be presumed by the EDA to be a trade secret
 23 15 protected under Code chapter 550 or common law and shall be
 23 16 kept confidential by the EDA unless otherwise ordered by a
 23 17 court.
 23 18    The division takes effect upon enactment and applies to
 23 19 equity investments in a qualifying business made on or after
 23 20 that date.  Equity investments in a qualifying business or
 23 21 community=based seed capital fund made prior to the effective
 23 22 date of the division shall be governed by current law.
 23 23    DIVISION III ==== ENTREPRENEUR INVESTMENT AWARDS PROGRAM.
 23 24  Division III amends the entrepreneur investment awards program
 23 25 administered by the EDA.  The division strikes provisions that
 23 26 prohibited the EDA from making awards under the program since
 23 27 July 1, 2014, and that required the EDA by December 31, 2014,
 23 28 to conduct a comprehensive review of the program and submit
 23 29 a report with specified information to the governor and the
 23 30 general assembly.
 23 31    The division modifies the purpose of the program to be
 23 32 to provide financial assistance to eligible entrepreneurial
 23 33 assistance providers (provider) that provide technical and
 23 34 financial assistance to entrepreneurs and start=up companies
 23 35 seeking to create, locate, or expand a business in Iowa.
 24  1 "Financial assistance" is defined in the division.
 24  2    The division changes the requirements for receiving an
 24  3 award.  To be eligible to receive an award under current
 24  4 law, an entrepreneurial assistance program must have been
 24  5 an Iowa=based business, expended at least $500,000 during
 24  6 the previous fiscal year to provide technical and financial
 24  7 assistance services that meet the broad=based needs of
 24  8 entrepreneurs seeking to create, locate, or expand a business
 24  9 in Iowa that intends to derive more than 10 percent of its
 24 10 gross sales from markets outside Iowa; and must have engaged
 24 11 and communicated with certain other programs, funding sources,
 24 12 and entities for its entrepreneur clients.  The division
 24 13 amends the eligibility for receiving financial assistance to
 24 14 require that a provider have its principal place of operations
 24 15 in Iowa and that the provider offer a comprehensive set of
 24 16 business development services to emerging and early=stage
 24 17 innovation companies to assist in the creation, location,
 24 18 growth, and long=term success of the company in Iowa.
 24 19 "Business development services" is defined in the division.
 24 20 Business development services may be performed at the physical
 24 21 location of the provider or the company and may be provided in
 24 22 consideration of equity participation in the company, a fee for
 24 23 services, or a membership agreement with the company.
 24 24    Under current law, the EDA board could approve, deny, or
 24 25 defer each application for a grant, and was required to award
 24 26 grants on a first=come, first=served basis.  The division
 24 27 specifies that the EDA board has the discretion to approve,
 24 28 deny, or defer each application for financial assistance and
 24 29 that the amount of financial assistance awarded to a provider
 24 30 is within the discretion of the EDA.  The division requires
 24 31 the EDA to award financial assistance on a competitive basis
 24 32 and allows the EDA to develop scoring criteria and establish
 24 33 minimum requirements for the receipt of a financial assistance
 24 34 award.
 24 35    In addition to the four factors relating to the provider's
 25  1 professional staff that the EDA may consider under current
 25  2 law in deciding whether to award financial assistance, the
 25  3 division provides that the EDA may also consider the service
 25  4 model and likelihood of success of the provider, the provider's
 25  5 similarity to other successful providers in the country, and
 25  6 the provider's financial need.
 25  7    The division modifies the maximum award amount for a
 25  8 recipient.  Under current law, a grant to an entrepreneur
 25  9 assistance program cannot exceed the lesser of 25 percent of
 25 10 the funds expended by the program during the previous fiscal
 25 11 year, 100 percent of the funds raised from certain persons
 25 12 by the program during the previous fiscal year, or $200,000.
 25 13 The division provides that the amount of financial assistance
 25 14 awarded to any one provider shall not exceed $200,000.
 25 15    The division modifies the permitted use of funds received
 25 16 under the program.  Under current law, grants are only
 25 17 permitted to be used for the purpose of operating costs
 25 18 incurred by the program.  The division specifies that financial
 25 19 assistance awarded to a provider shall only be used for
 25 20 the purpose of operating costs incurred by the provider in
 25 21 the provision of business development services to emerging
 25 22 and early=stage innovation companies in Iowa.  The division
 25 23 further requires that such financial assistance shall not be
 25 24 distributed to owners or investors of the company to which the
 25 25 business development services are being provided and shall not
 25 26 be provided to other persons assisting with the provision of
 25 27 the services.
 25 28    Under current law, an entrepreneurial assistance provider is
 25 29 required to accept client referrals from the EDA as a condition
 25 30 of receiving a grant.  The division provides that the EDA may
 25 31 make client referrals to eligible providers.
 25 32    DIVISION IV ==== MISCELLANEOUS CHANGES.  Division IV makes
 25 33 several miscellaneous changes to other EDA programs.  The
 25 34 division amends the sales and use tax refund available under
 25 35 the workforce housing tax incentive program.  That refund
 26  1 is available for sales and use tax paid prior to project
 26  2 completion, which is currently defined to mean the first date
 26  3 upon which the average annualized production of finished
 26  4 product for the preceding 90=day period at the manufacturing
 26  5 facility operated by the eligible business is at least 50
 26  6 percent of the initial design capacity of the facility.  The
 26  7 division amends the definition of "project completion" to mean
 26  8 the date on which the EDA notifies the department of revenue
 26  9 that all applicable requirements of a workforce housing tax
 26 10 incentive program agreement are satisfied.  This provision
 26 11 takes effect upon enactment and applies retroactively to July
 26 12 1, 2014, for all workforce housing tax incentive agreements
 26 13 entered into on or after that date.
 26 14    The division allows the EDA to extend the project
 26 15 completion date for a project awarded tax incentives under the
 26 16 redevelopment tax credit program and the housing enterprise
 26 17 zone tax incentives program if the property that is the subject
 26 18 of the project suffered a catastrophic fire during the 2014
 26 19 calendar year.
       LSB 1212HV (3) 86
       mm/sc
 18 22 program (program) that will be administered by the EDA and that
 18 23 will provide tax credits to eligible businesses that produce
 18 24 renewable chemicals in Iowa from biomass feedstock.  "Renewable
 18 25 chemical", "biomass feedstock", and other related terms are
 18 26 defined in the division.
 18 27    In order to qualify for the tax credit, a business must
 18 28 meet several requirements.  First, the business must be
 18 29 physically located in Iowa and operated for profit under
 18 30 single management.  Second, the business must not be an
 18 31 entity providing professional services, health care services,
 18 32 or medical treatments, or be engaged primarily in retail
 18 33 operations.  Third, the business must have organized, expanded,
 18 34 or located in Iowa on or after the effective date of the
 18 35 division.  Fourth, the business must not be, in the discretion
 19  1 of the EDA, ineligible under certain provisions relating to the
 19  2 relocation or reduction of business operations within Iowa.
 19  3 Fifth, the business must be in compliance with all agreements
 19  4 entered into under the program or other programs administered
 19  5 by the EDA.
 19  6    An eligible business seeking a tax credit is required
 19  7 to apply to the EDA during the calendar year following the
 19  8 calendar year in which the renewable chemicals are produced.
 19  9 The application must include the amount of renewable chemicals
 19 10 produced in Iowa from biomass feedstock by the eligible
 19 11 business during the calendar year, measured in pounds, and any
 19 12 other information reasonably required by the EDA in order to
 19 13 establish and verify eligibility under the program.  The EDA
 19 14 may accept applications on a continuous basis or may establish
 19 15 an annual application deadline.
 19 16    Before being issued a tax credit, an eligible business
 19 17 is required to enter into an agreement with the EDA for the
 19 18 successful completion of all requirements of the program.  The
 19 19 EDA is authorized to impose two compliance cost fees under the
 19 20 program.  The first fee equals $500 per agreement.  The second
 19 21 fee equals 0.5 percent of the value of the tax credit claimed
 19 22 pursuant to the agreement if the agreement has an aggregate tax
 19 23 credit value of $100,000 or greater.
 19 24    An eligible business that fails to comply with the
 19 25 requirements of the program or the terms of an agreement with
 19 26 the EDA may have its tax credits reduced, terminated, or
 19 27 rescinded, and may be subject to the repayment or recapture of
 19 28 claimed tax credits.
 19 29    Upon determining that all requirements of an agreement and
 19 30 the program have been fulfilled, the EDA shall issue a tax
 19 31 credit and related tax credit certificate to the eligible
 19 32 business in an amount equal to the product of $.05 multiplied
 19 33 by the number of pounds of renewable chemicals produced in Iowa
 19 34 from biomass feedstock by the eligible business during the
 19 35 calendar year.  Renewable chemicals produced by an eligible
 20  1 business prior to the effective date of the division, or
 20  2 prior to the date the business first qualifies as an eligible
 20  3 business, or after calendar year 2025, shall not qualify for
 20  4 the tax credit.
 20  5    The tax credit shall be claimed for the tax year during
 20  6 which the eligible business was issued the tax credit.  The tax
 20  7 credit may be claimed against the individual income tax and the
 20  8 corporate income tax.  The credit is refundable or may, at the
 20  9 election of the taxpayer, be carried forward for up to one tax
 20 10 year.   The tax credit shall not be transferred to any person.  A
 20 11 tax credit issued to a partnership, limited liability company,
 20 12 S corporation, cooperative organized under Code chapter 501
 20 13 and filing as a partnership for federal tax purposes, estate,
 20 14 or trust electing to have the income taxed directly to the
 20 15 individual may be claimed by the individual based upon the pro
 20 16 rata share of the individual's earnings from that entity.
 20 17    The division provides that the program is subject to the
 20 18 EDA's maximum aggregate tax credit cap of $170 million per
 20 19 fiscal year in Code section 15.119, and not more than $15
 20 20 million per fiscal year may be issued by the EDA under the
 20 21 program.  In addition, the maximum amount of tax credit that
 20 22 may be issued to an eligible business in any one calendar year
 20 23 shall not exceed $1 million or $500,000, depending on whether
 20 24 the eligible business has been operating in Iowa at the time of
 20 25 application for five or fewer years, or more than five years,
 20 26 respectively.  An eligible business shall not receive more than
 20 27 five tax credits under the program.  The EDA is required to
 20 28 issue tax credits on a first=come, first=served basis until the
 20 29 maximum amount of $15 million per fiscal year is reached.  If
 20 30 the amount of tax credits exceeds this amount in a fiscal year,
 20 31 the EDA is required to establish a wait list and give priority
 20 32 in subsequent years to the eligible businesses on the wait
 20 33 list.
 20 34    The division provides for the confidentiality of certain
 20 35 information under the program.  The identity of a tax credit
 21  1 recipient and the amount of the tax credit shall be considered
 21  2 public information under Code chapter 22 (examination of public
 21  3 records), but any other information or record in the possession
 21  4 of the EDA with respect to the program shall be presumed by
 21  5 the EDA to be a trade secret protected under Code chapter 550
 21  6 or common law and shall be kept confidential by the EDA unless
 21  7 otherwise ordered by a court.
 21  8    The division takes effect upon enactment and applies to
 21  9 renewable chemicals produced in Iowa from biomass feedstock on
 21 10 or after that date.  The division applies retroactively to tax
 21 11 years beginning on or after January 1, 2015.
 21 12    DIVISION II ==== ANGEL INVESTOR TAX CREDITS.   Division II
 21 13 makes several changes to the tax credit for investments in
 21 14 qualifying businesses and community=based seed capital funds,
 21 15 often referred to as the angel investor tax credits.  The
 21 16 division amends the purpose of the tax credit in Code section
 21 17 15E.41.  The division excludes investments in community=based
 21 18 seed capital funds from qualifying for the tax credit and
 21 19 makes several conforming amendments to remove references to
 21 20 community=based seed capital funds from the Code.
 21 21    The division modifies the amount and dollar limitation of
 21 22 the tax credit for a taxpayer.  The tax credit is increased
 21 23 from 20 percent to 25 percent of a taxpayer's equity investment
 21 24 in a qualifying business.  Under current law, a taxpayer cannot
 21 25 claim more than $50,000 of tax credit per investment in a
 21 26 qualifying business, and for each tax year a taxpayer and the
 21 27 taxpayer's affiliates cannot claim tax credits for more than
 21 28 five investments in five different qualifying businesses.  The
 21 29 division amends this dollar limitation to prohibit a natural
 21 30 person and the person's spouse, child, or sibling from claiming
 21 31 a combined amount of more than $100,000 in tax credits per tax
 21 32 year.
 21 33    The division also provides that no more than $500,000 in tax
 21 34 credits may be issued per tax year for equity investments in
 21 35 any one qualifying business.
 22  1 The division modifies the procedures for claiming the tax
 22  2 credit.  Under current law, the tax credit is not refundable
 22  3 but available for carryforward for up to five tax years.  The
 22  4 division makes the tax credit refundable for an investment
 22  5 made by a natural person, and for any other person reduces the
 22  6 carryforward period to three years.
 22  7    The division strikes a provision permitting the EDA
 22  8 to cooperate with small business development centers to
 22  9 disseminate information regarding the credits and to develop
 22 10 standard application forms, and requiring the EDA to distribute
 22 11 copies of the application forms to all community=based seed
 22 12 capital funds and potential individual investors.
 22 13    The division modifies the eligibility requirements for
 22 14 qualifying businesses.  The division strikes the requirement
 22 15 that a business have an owner that meets at least one of
 22 16 four qualifications relating to business education or
 22 17 business experience.  The division requires that a business
 22 18 be participating in an entrepreneurial assistance program,
 22 19 as defined in the division, but allows the EDA to waive this
 22 20 requirement if the business establishes that its owners,
 22 21 directors, officers, and employees have an appropriate level
 22 22 of experience such that an entrepreneurial assistance program
 22 23 would not materially change the prospects of the business.
 22 24 The EDA is allowed to consult with outside service providers
 22 25 in considering such a waiver.  The division increases from $5
 22 26 million to $10 million the maximum amount of net worth that
 22 27 a business may have to be considered a qualifying business.
 22 28 The division increases from $250,000 to $500,000 the amount of
 22 29 financing that a business must have in order to be considered a
 22 30 qualifying business, removes "near equity" from the types of
 22 31 financing that will be considered in that calculation, requires
 22 32 that the financing be secured at the time of application for
 22 33 the tax credits, and requires that the business have at least
 22 34 two investors at the time of application for the tax credits.
 22 35 These modified eligibility requirements apply to businesses
 23  1 that submit an application to the EDA to be registered as a
 23  2 qualifying business on or after the effective date of this
 23  3 division of the bill, and businesses that submitted such an
 23  4 application to the EDA before the effective date of this
 23  5 division of the bill shall be governed by current law.
 23  6    The division provides for the confidentiality of certain
 23  7 information with regard to the tax credit.  The identity of
 23  8 a qualifying business, the identity of an investor and the
 23  9 qualifying business in which the investor made an equity
 23 10 investment, and the total number and amount of tax credits
 23 11 issued shall be considered public information under Code
 23 12 chapter 22 (examination of public records), but any other
 23 13 information or record in the possession of the EDA with respect
 23 14 to the program shall be presumed by the EDA to be a trade secret
 23 15 protected under Code chapter 550 or common law and shall be
 23 16 kept confidential by the EDA unless otherwise ordered by a
 23 17 court.
 23 18    The division takes effect upon enactment and applies to
 23 19 equity investments in a qualifying business made on or after
 23 20 that date.  Equity investments in a qualifying business or
 23 21 community=based seed capital fund made prior to the effective
 23 22 date of the division shall be governed by current law.
 23 23    DIVISION III ==== ENTREPRENEUR INVESTMENT AWARDS PROGRAM.
 23 24  Division III amends the entrepreneur investment awards program
 23 25 administered by the EDA.  The division strikes provisions that
 23 26 prohibited the EDA from making awards under the program since
 23 27 July 1, 2014, and that required the EDA by December 31, 2014,
 23 28 to conduct a comprehensive review of the program and submit
 23 29 a report with specified information to the governor and the
 23 30 general assembly.
 23 31    The division modifies the purpose of the program to be
 23 32 to provide financial assistance to eligible entrepreneurial
 23 33 assistance providers (provider) that provide technical and
 23 34 financial assistance to entrepreneurs and start=up companies
 23 35 seeking to create, locate, or expand a business in Iowa.
 24  1 "Financial assistance" is defined in the division.
 24  2    The division changes the requirements for receiving an
 24  3 award.  To be eligible to receive an award under current
 24  4 law, an entrepreneurial assistance program must have been
 24  5 an Iowa=based business, expended at least $500,000 during
 24  6 the previous fiscal year to provide technical and financial
 24  7 assistance services that meet the broad=based needs of
 24  8 entrepreneurs seeking to create, locate, or expand a business
 24  9 in Iowa that intends to derive more than 10 percent of its
 24 10 gross sales from markets outside Iowa; and must have engaged
 24 11 and communicated with certain other programs, funding sources,
 24 12 and entities for its entrepreneur clients.  The division
 24 13 amends the eligibility for receiving financial assistance to
 24 14 require that a provider have its principal place of operations
 24 15 in Iowa and that the provider offer a comprehensive set of
 24 16 business development services to emerging and early=stage
 24 17 innovation companies to assist in the creation, location,
 24 18 growth, and long=term success of the company in Iowa.
 24 19 "Business development services" is defined in the division.
 24 20 Business development services may be performed at the physical
 24 21 location of the provider or the company and may be provided in
 24 22 consideration of equity participation in the company, a fee for
 24 23 services, or a membership agreement with the company.
 24 24    Under current law, the EDA board could approve, deny, or
 24 25 defer each application for a grant, and was required to award
 24 26 grants on a first=come, first=served basis.  The division
 24 27 specifies that the EDA board has the discretion to approve,
 24 28 deny, or defer each application for financial assistance and
 24 29 that the amount of financial assistance awarded to a provider
 24 30 is within the discretion of the EDA.  The division requires
 24 31 the EDA to award financial assistance on a competitive basis
 24 32 and allows the EDA to develop scoring criteria and establish
 24 33 minimum requirements for the receipt of a financial assistance
 24 34 award.
 24 35    In addition to the four factors relating to the provider's
 25  1 professional staff that the EDA may consider under current
 25  2 law in deciding whether to award financial assistance, the
 25  3 division provides that the EDA may also consider the service
 25  4 model and likelihood of success of the provider, the provider's
 25  5 similarity to other successful providers in the country, and
 25  6 the provider's financial need.
 25  7    The division modifies the maximum award amount for a
 25  8 recipient.  Under current law, a grant to an entrepreneur
 25  9 assistance program cannot exceed the lesser of 25 percent of
 25 10 the funds expended by the program during the previous fiscal
 25 11 year, 100 percent of the funds raised from certain persons
 25 12 by the program during the previous fiscal year, or $200,000.
 25 13 The division provides that the amount of financial assistance
 25 14 awarded to any one provider shall not exceed $200,000.
 25 15    The division modifies the permitted use of funds received
 25 16 under the program.  Under current law, grants are only
 25 17 permitted to be used for the purpose of operating costs
 25 18 incurred by the program.  The division specifies that financial
 25 19 assistance awarded to a provider shall only be used for
 25 20 the purpose of operating costs incurred by the provider in
 25 21 the provision of business development services to emerging
 25 22 and early=stage innovation companies in Iowa.  The division
 25 23 further requires that such financial assistance shall not be
 25 24 distributed to owners or investors of the company to which the
 25 25 business development services are being provided and shall not
 25 26 be provided to other persons assisting with the provision of
 25 27 the services.
 25 28    Under current law, an entrepreneurial assistance provider is
 25 29 required to accept client referrals from the EDA as a condition
 25 30 of receiving a grant.  The division provides that the EDA may
 25 31 make client referrals to eligible providers.
 25 32    DIVISION IV ==== MISCELLANEOUS CHANGES.  Division IV makes
 25 33 several miscellaneous changes to other EDA programs.  The
 25 34 division amends the sales and use tax refund available under
 25 35 the workforce housing tax incentive program.  That refund
 26  1 is available for sales and use tax paid prior to project
 26  2 completion, which is currently defined to mean the first date
 26  3 upon which the average annualized production of finished
 26  4 product for the preceding 90=day period at the manufacturing
 26  5 facility operated by the eligible business is at least 50
 26  6 percent of the initial design capacity of the facility.  The
 26  7 division amends the definition of "project completion" to mean
 26  8 the date on which the EDA notifies the department of revenue
 26  9 that all applicable requirements of a workforce housing tax
 26 10 incentive program agreement are satisfied.  This provision
 26 11 takes effect upon enactment and applies retroactively to July
 26 12 1, 2014, for all workforce housing tax incentive agreements
 26 13 entered into on or after that date.
 26 14    The division allows the EDA to extend the project
 26 15 completion date for a project awarded tax incentives under the
 26 16 redevelopment tax credit program and the housing enterprise
 26 17 zone tax incentives program if the property that is the subject
 26 18 of the project suffered a catastrophic fire during the 2014
 26 19 calendar year.
       LSB 1212HV (3) 86
       mm/sc
 18 23 will provide tax credits to eligible businesses that produce
 18 24 renewable chemicals in Iowa from biomass feedstock.  "Renewable
 18 25 chemical", "biomass feedstock", and other related terms are
 18 26 defined in the division.
 18 27    In order to qualify for the tax credit, a business must
 18 28 meet several requirements.  First, the business must be
 18 29 physically located in Iowa and operated for profit under
 18 30 single management.  Second, the business must not be an
 18 31 entity providing professional services, health care services,
 18 32 or medical treatments, or be engaged primarily in retail
 18 33 operations.  Third, the business must have organized, expanded,
 18 34 or located in Iowa on or after the effective date of the
 18 35 division.  Fourth, the business must not be, in the discretion
 19  1 of the EDA, ineligible under certain provisions relating to the
 19  2 relocation or reduction of business operations within Iowa.
 19  3 Fifth, the business must be in compliance with all agreements
 19  4 entered into under the program or other programs administered
 19  5 by the EDA.
 19  6    An eligible business seeking a tax credit is required
 19  7 to apply to the EDA during the calendar year following the
 19  8 calendar year in which the renewable chemicals are produced.
 19  9 The application must include the amount of renewable chemicals
 19 10 produced in Iowa from biomass feedstock by the eligible
 19 11 business during the calendar year, measured in pounds, and any
 19 12 other information reasonably required by the EDA in order to
 19 13 establish and verify eligibility under the program.  The EDA
 19 14 may accept applications on a continuous basis or may establish
 19 15 an annual application deadline.
 19 16    Before being issued a tax credit, an eligible business
 19 17 is required to enter into an agreement with the EDA for the
 19 18 successful completion of all requirements of the program.  The
 19 19 EDA is authorized to impose two compliance cost fees under the
 19 20 program.  The first fee equals $500 per agreement.  The second
 19 21 fee equals 0.5 percent of the value of the tax credit claimed
 19 22 pursuant to the agreement if the agreement has an aggregate tax
 19 23 credit value of $100,000 or greater.
 19 24    An eligible business that fails to comply with the
 19 25 requirements of the program or the terms of an agreement with
 19 26 the EDA may have its tax credits reduced, terminated, or
 19 27 rescinded, and may be subject to the repayment or recapture of
 19 28 claimed tax credits.
 19 29    Upon determining that all requirements of an agreement and
 19 30 the program have been fulfilled, the EDA shall issue a tax
 19 31 credit and related tax credit certificate to the eligible
 19 32 business in an amount equal to the product of $.05 multiplied
 19 33 by the number of pounds of renewable chemicals produced in Iowa
 19 34 from biomass feedstock by the eligible business during the
 19 35 calendar year.  Renewable chemicals produced by an eligible
 20  1 business prior to the effective date of the division, or
 20  2 prior to the date the business first qualifies as an eligible
 20  3 business, or after calendar year 2025, shall not qualify for
 20  4 the tax credit.
 20  5    The tax credit shall be claimed for the tax year during
 20  6 which the eligible business was issued the tax credit.  The tax
 20  7 credit may be claimed against the individual income tax and the
 20  8 corporate income tax.  The credit is refundable or may, at the
 20  9 election of the taxpayer, be carried forward for up to one tax
 20 10 year.   The tax credit shall not be transferred to any person.  A
 20 11 tax credit issued to a partnership, limited liability company,
 20 12 S corporation, cooperative organized under Code chapter 501
 20 13 and filing as a partnership for federal tax purposes, estate,
 20 14 or trust electing to have the income taxed directly to the
 20 15 individual may be claimed by the individual based upon the pro
 20 16 rata share of the individual's earnings from that entity.
 20 17    The division provides that the program is subject to the
 20 18 EDA's maximum aggregate tax credit cap of $170 million per
 20 19 fiscal year in Code section 15.119, and not more than $15
 20 20 million per fiscal year may be issued by the EDA under the
 20 21 program.  In addition, the maximum amount of tax credit that
 20 22 may be issued to an eligible business in any one calendar year
 20 23 shall not exceed $1 million or $500,000, depending on whether
 20 24 the eligible business has been operating in Iowa at the time of
 20 25 application for five or fewer years, or more than five years,
 20 26 respectively.  An eligible business shall not receive more than
 20 27 five tax credits under the program.  The EDA is required to
 20 28 issue tax credits on a first=come, first=served basis until the
 20 29 maximum amount of $15 million per fiscal year is reached.  If
 20 30 the amount of tax credits exceeds this amount in a fiscal year,
 20 31 the EDA is required to establish a wait list and give priority
 20 32 in subsequent years to the eligible businesses on the wait
 20 33 list.
 20 34    The division provides for the confidentiality of certain
 20 35 information under the program.  The identity of a tax credit
 21  1 recipient and the amount of the tax credit shall be considered
 21  2 public information under Code chapter 22 (examination of public
 21  3 records), but any other information or record in the possession
 21  4 of the EDA with respect to the program shall be presumed by
 21  5 the EDA to be a trade secret protected under Code chapter 550
 21  6 or common law and shall be kept confidential by the EDA unless
 21  7 otherwise ordered by a court.
 21  8    The division takes effect upon enactment and applies to
 21  9 renewable chemicals produced in Iowa from biomass feedstock on
 21 10 or after that date.  The division applies retroactively to tax
 21 11 years beginning on or after January 1, 2015.
 21 12    DIVISION II ==== ANGEL INVESTOR TAX CREDITS.   Division II
 21 13 makes several changes to the tax credit for investments in
 21 14 qualifying businesses and community=based seed capital funds,
 21 15 often referred to as the angel investor tax credits.  The
 21 16 division amends the purpose of the tax credit in Code section
 21 17 15E.41.  The division excludes investments in community=based
 21 18 seed capital funds from qualifying for the tax credit and
 21 19 makes several conforming amendments to remove references to
 21 20 community=based seed capital funds from the Code.
 21 21    The division modifies the amount and dollar limitation of
 21 22 the tax credit for a taxpayer.  The tax credit is increased
 21 23 from 20 percent to 25 percent of a taxpayer's equity investment
 21 24 in a qualifying business.  Under current law, a taxpayer cannot
 21 25 claim more than $50,000 of tax credit per investment in a
 21 26 qualifying business, and for each tax year a taxpayer and the
 21 27 taxpayer's affiliates cannot claim tax credits for more than
 21 28 five investments in five different qualifying businesses.  The
 21 29 division amends this dollar limitation to prohibit a natural
 21 30 person and the person's spouse, child, or sibling from claiming
 21 31 a combined amount of more than $100,000 in tax credits per tax
 21 32 year.
 21 33    The division also provides that no more than $500,000 in tax
 21 34 credits may be issued per tax year for equity investments in
 21 35 any one qualifying business.
 22  1 The division modifies the procedures for claiming the tax
 22  2 credit.  Under current law, the tax credit is not refundable
 22  3 but available for carryforward for up to five tax years.  The
 22  4 division makes the tax credit refundable for an investment
 22  5 made by a natural person, and for any other person reduces the
 22  6 carryforward period to three years.
 22  7    The division strikes a provision permitting the EDA
 22  8 to cooperate with small business development centers to
 22  9 disseminate information regarding the credits and to develop
 22 10 standard application forms, and requiring the EDA to distribute
 22 11 copies of the application forms to all community=based seed
 22 12 capital funds and potential individual investors.
 22 13    The division modifies the eligibility requirements for
 22 14 qualifying businesses.  The division strikes the requirement
 22 15 that a business have an owner that meets at least one of
 22 16 four qualifications relating to business education or
 22 17 business experience.  The division requires that a business
 22 18 be participating in an entrepreneurial assistance program,
 22 19 as defined in the division, but allows the EDA to waive this
 22 20 requirement if the business establishes that its owners,
 22 21 directors, officers, and employees have an appropriate level
 22 22 of experience such that an entrepreneurial assistance program
 22 23 would not materially change the prospects of the business.
 22 24 The EDA is allowed to consult with outside service providers
 22 25 in considering such a waiver.  The division increases from $5
 22 26 million to $10 million the maximum amount of net worth that
 22 27 a business may have to be considered a qualifying business.
 22 28 The division increases from $250,000 to $500,000 the amount of
 22 29 financing that a business must have in order to be considered a
 22 30 qualifying business, removes "near equity" from the types of
 22 31 financing that will be considered in that calculation, requires
 22 32 that the financing be secured at the time of application for
 22 33 the tax credits, and requires that the business have at least
 22 34 two investors at the time of application for the tax credits.
 22 35 These modified eligibility requirements apply to businesses
 23  1 that submit an application to the EDA to be registered as a
 23  2 qualifying business on or after the effective date of this
 23  3 division of the bill, and businesses that submitted such an
 23  4 application to the EDA before the effective date of this
 23  5 division of the bill shall be governed by current law.
 23  6    The division provides for the confidentiality of certain
 23  7 information with regard to the tax credit.  The identity of
 23  8 a qualifying business, the identity of an investor and the
 23  9 qualifying business in which the investor made an equity
 23 10 investment, and the total number and amount of tax credits
 23 11 issued shall be considered public information under Code
 23 12 chapter 22 (examination of public records), but any other
 23 13 information or record in the possession of the EDA with respect
 23 14 to the program shall be presumed by the EDA to be a trade secret
 23 15 protected under Code chapter 550 or common law and shall be
 23 16 kept confidential by the EDA unless otherwise ordered by a
 23 17 court.
 23 18    The division takes effect upon enactment and applies to
 23 19 equity investments in a qualifying business made on or after
 23 20 that date.  Equity investments in a qualifying business or
 23 21 community=based seed capital fund made prior to the effective
 23 22 date of the division shall be governed by current law.
 23 23    DIVISION III ==== ENTREPRENEUR INVESTMENT AWARDS PROGRAM.
 23 24  Division III amends the entrepreneur investment awards program
 23 25 administered by the EDA.  The division strikes provisions that
 23 26 prohibited the EDA from making awards under the program since
 23 27 July 1, 2014, and that required the EDA by December 31, 2014,
 23 28 to conduct a comprehensive review of the program and submit
 23 29 a report with specified information to the governor and the
 23 30 general assembly.
 23 31    The division modifies the purpose of the program to be
 23 32 to provide financial assistance to eligible entrepreneurial
 23 33 assistance providers (provider) that provide technical and
 23 34 financial assistance to entrepreneurs and start=up companies
 23 35 seeking to create, locate, or expand a business in Iowa.
 24  1 "Financial assistance" is defined in the division.
 24  2    The division changes the requirements for receiving an
 24  3 award.  To be eligible to receive an award under current
 24  4 law, an entrepreneurial assistance program must have been
 24  5 an Iowa=based business, expended at least $500,000 during
 24  6 the previous fiscal year to provide technical and financial
 24  7 assistance services that meet the broad=based needs of
 24  8 entrepreneurs seeking to create, locate, or expand a business
 24  9 in Iowa that intends to derive more than 10 percent of its
 24 10 gross sales from markets outside Iowa; and must have engaged
 24 11 and communicated with certain other programs, funding sources,
 24 12 and entities for its entrepreneur clients.  The division
 24 13 amends the eligibility for receiving financial assistance to
 24 14 require that a provider have its principal place of operations
 24 15 in Iowa and that the provider offer a comprehensive set of
 24 16 business development services to emerging and early=stage
 24 17 innovation companies to assist in the creation, location,
 24 18 growth, and long=term success of the company in Iowa.
 24 19 "Business development services" is defined in the division.
 24 20 Business development services may be performed at the physical
 24 21 location of the provider or the company and may be provided in
 24 22 consideration of equity participation in the company, a fee for
 24 23 services, or a membership agreement with the company.
 24 24    Under current law, the EDA board could approve, deny, or
 24 25 defer each application for a grant, and was required to award
 24 26 grants on a first=come, first=served basis.  The division
 24 27 specifies that the EDA board has the discretion to approve,
 24 28 deny, or defer each application for financial assistance and
 24 29 that the amount of financial assistance awarded to a provider
 24 30 is within the discretion of the EDA.  The division requires
 24 31 the EDA to award financial assistance on a competitive basis
 24 32 and allows the EDA to develop scoring criteria and establish
 24 33 minimum requirements for the receipt of a financial assistance
 24 34 award.
 24 35    In addition to the four factors relating to the provider's
 25  1 professional staff that the EDA may consider under current
 25  2 law in deciding whether to award financial assistance, the
 25  3 division provides that the EDA may also consider the service
 25  4 model and likelihood of success of the provider, the provider's
 25  5 similarity to other successful providers in the country, and
 25  6 the provider's financial need.
 25  7    The division modifies the maximum award amount for a
 25  8 recipient.  Under current law, a grant to an entrepreneur
 25  9 assistance program cannot exceed the lesser of 25 percent of
 25 10 the funds expended by the program during the previous fiscal
 25 11 year, 100 percent of the funds raised from certain persons
 25 12 by the program during the previous fiscal year, or $200,000.
 25 13 The division provides that the amount of financial assistance
 25 14 awarded to any one provider shall not exceed $200,000.
 25 15    The division modifies the permitted use of funds received
 25 16 under the program.  Under current law, grants are only
 25 17 permitted to be used for the purpose of operating costs
 25 18 incurred by the program.  The division specifies that financial
 25 19 assistance awarded to a provider shall only be used for
 25 20 the purpose of operating costs incurred by the provider in
 25 21 the provision of business development services to emerging
 25 22 and early=stage innovation companies in Iowa.  The division
 25 23 further requires that such financial assistance shall not be
 25 24 distributed to owners or investors of the company to which the
 25 25 business development services are being provided and shall not
 25 26 be provided to other persons assisting with the provision of
 25 27 the services.
 25 28    Under current law, an entrepreneurial assistance provider is
 25 29 required to accept client referrals from the EDA as a condition
 25 30 of receiving a grant.  The division provides that the EDA may
 25 31 make client referrals to eligible providers.
 25 32    DIVISION IV ==== MISCELLANEOUS CHANGES.  Division IV makes
 25 33 several miscellaneous changes to other EDA programs.  The
 25 34 division amends the sales and use tax refund available under
 25 35 the workforce housing tax incentive program.  That refund
 26  1 is available for sales and use tax paid prior to project
 26  2 completion, which is currently defined to mean the first date
 26  3 upon which the average annualized production of finished
 26  4 product for the preceding 90=day period at the manufacturing
 26  5 facility operated by the eligible business is at least 50
 26  6 percent of the initial design capacity of the facility.  The
 26  7 division amends the definition of "project completion" to mean
 26  8 the date on which the EDA notifies the department of revenue
 26  9 that all applicable requirements of a workforce housing tax
 26 10 incentive program agreement are satisfied.  This provision
 26 11 takes effect upon enactment and applies retroactively to July
 26 12 1, 2014, for all workforce housing tax incentive agreements
 26 13 entered into on or after that date.
 26 14    The division allows the EDA to extend the project
 26 15 completion date for a project awarded tax incentives under the
 26 16 redevelopment tax credit program and the housing enterprise
 26 17 zone tax incentives program if the property that is the subject
 26 18 of the project suffered a catastrophic fire during the 2014
 26 19 calendar year.
       LSB 1212HV (3) 86
       mm/sc
 18 24 renewable chemicals in Iowa from biomass feedstock.  "Renewable
 18 25 chemical", "biomass feedstock", and other related terms are
 18 26 defined in the division.
 18 27    In order to qualify for the tax credit, a business must
 18 28 meet several requirements.  First, the business must be
 18 29 physically located in Iowa and operated for profit under
 18 30 single management.  Second, the business must not be an
 18 31 entity providing professional services, health care services,
 18 32 or medical treatments, or be engaged primarily in retail
 18 33 operations.  Third, the business must have organized, expanded,
 18 34 or located in Iowa on or after the effective date of the
 18 35 division.  Fourth, the business must not be, in the discretion
 19  1 of the EDA, ineligible under certain provisions relating to the
 19  2 relocation or reduction of business operations within Iowa.
 19  3 Fifth, the business must be in compliance with all agreements
 19  4 entered into under the program or other programs administered
 19  5 by the EDA.
 19  6    An eligible business seeking a tax credit is required
 19  7 to apply to the EDA during the calendar year following the
 19  8 calendar year in which the renewable chemicals are produced.
 19  9 The application must include the amount of renewable chemicals
 19 10 produced in Iowa from biomass feedstock by the eligible
 19 11 business during the calendar year, measured in pounds, and any
 19 12 other information reasonably required by the EDA in order to
 19 13 establish and verify eligibility under the program.  The EDA
 19 14 may accept applications on a continuous basis or may establish
 19 15 an annual application deadline.
 19 16    Before being issued a tax credit, an eligible business
 19 17 is required to enter into an agreement with the EDA for the
 19 18 successful completion of all requirements of the program.  The
 19 19 EDA is authorized to impose two compliance cost fees under the
 19 20 program.  The first fee equals $500 per agreement.  The second
 19 21 fee equals 0.5 percent of the value of the tax credit claimed
 19 22 pursuant to the agreement if the agreement has an aggregate tax
 19 23 credit value of $100,000 or greater.
 19 24    An eligible business that fails to comply with the
 19 25 requirements of the program or the terms of an agreement with
 19 26 the EDA may have its tax credits reduced, terminated, or
 19 27 rescinded, and may be subject to the repayment or recapture of
 19 28 claimed tax credits.
 19 29    Upon determining that all requirements of an agreement and
 19 30 the program have been fulfilled, the EDA shall issue a tax
 19 31 credit and related tax credit certificate to the eligible
 19 32 business in an amount equal to the product of $.05 multiplied
 19 33 by the number of pounds of renewable chemicals produced in Iowa
 19 34 from biomass feedstock by the eligible business during the
 19 35 calendar year.  Renewable chemicals produced by an eligible
 20  1 business prior to the effective date of the division, or
 20  2 prior to the date the business first qualifies as an eligible
 20  3 business, or after calendar year 2025, shall not qualify for
 20  4 the tax credit.
 20  5    The tax credit shall be claimed for the tax year during
 20  6 which the eligible business was issued the tax credit.  The tax
 20  7 credit may be claimed against the individual income tax and the
 20  8 corporate income tax.  The credit is refundable or may, at the
 20  9 election of the taxpayer, be carried forward for up to one tax
 20 10 year.   The tax credit shall not be transferred to any person.  A
 20 11 tax credit issued to a partnership, limited liability company,
 20 12 S corporation, cooperative organized under Code chapter 501
 20 13 and filing as a partnership for federal tax purposes, estate,
 20 14 or trust electing to have the income taxed directly to the
 20 15 individual may be claimed by the individual based upon the pro
 20 16 rata share of the individual's earnings from that entity.
 20 17    The division provides that the program is subject to the
 20 18 EDA's maximum aggregate tax credit cap of $170 million per
 20 19 fiscal year in Code section 15.119, and not more than $15
 20 20 million per fiscal year may be issued by the EDA under the
 20 21 program.  In addition, the maximum amount of tax credit that
 20 22 may be issued to an eligible business in any one calendar year
 20 23 shall not exceed $1 million or $500,000, depending on whether
 20 24 the eligible business has been operating in Iowa at the time of
 20 25 application for five or fewer years, or more than five years,
 20 26 respectively.  An eligible business shall not receive more than
 20 27 five tax credits under the program.  The EDA is required to
 20 28 issue tax credits on a first=come, first=served basis until the
 20 29 maximum amount of $15 million per fiscal year is reached.  If
 20 30 the amount of tax credits exceeds this amount in a fiscal year,
 20 31 the EDA is required to establish a wait list and give priority
 20 32 in subsequent years to the eligible businesses on the wait
 20 33 list.
 20 34    The division provides for the confidentiality of certain
 20 35 information under the program.  The identity of a tax credit
 21  1 recipient and the amount of the tax credit shall be considered
 21  2 public information under Code chapter 22 (examination of public
 21  3 records), but any other information or record in the possession
 21  4 of the EDA with respect to the program shall be presumed by
 21  5 the EDA to be a trade secret protected under Code chapter 550
 21  6 or common law and shall be kept confidential by the EDA unless
 21  7 otherwise ordered by a court.
 21  8    The division takes effect upon enactment and applies to
 21  9 renewable chemicals produced in Iowa from biomass feedstock on
 21 10 or after that date.  The division applies retroactively to tax
 21 11 years beginning on or after January 1, 2015.
 21 12    DIVISION II ==== ANGEL INVESTOR TAX CREDITS.   Division II
 21 13 makes several changes to the tax credit for investments in
 21 14 qualifying businesses and community=based seed capital funds,
 21 15 often referred to as the angel investor tax credits.  The
 21 16 division amends the purpose of the tax credit in Code section
 21 17 15E.41.  The division excludes investments in community=based
 21 18 seed capital funds from qualifying for the tax credit and
 21 19 makes several conforming amendments to remove references to
 21 20 community=based seed capital funds from the Code.
 21 21    The division modifies the amount and dollar limitation of
 21 22 the tax credit for a taxpayer.  The tax credit is increased
 21 23 from 20 percent to 25 percent of a taxpayer's equity investment
 21 24 in a qualifying business.  Under current law, a taxpayer cannot
 21 25 claim more than $50,000 of tax credit per investment in a
 21 26 qualifying business, and for each tax year a taxpayer and the
 21 27 taxpayer's affiliates cannot claim tax credits for more than
 21 28 five investments in five different qualifying businesses.  The
 21 29 division amends this dollar limitation to prohibit a natural
 21 30 person and the person's spouse, child, or sibling from claiming
 21 31 a combined amount of more than $100,000 in tax credits per tax
 21 32 year.
 21 33    The division also provides that no more than $500,000 in tax
 21 34 credits may be issued per tax year for equity investments in
 21 35 any one qualifying business.
 22  1 The division modifies the procedures for claiming the tax
 22  2 credit.  Under current law, the tax credit is not refundable
 22  3 but available for carryforward for up to five tax years.  The
 22  4 division makes the tax credit refundable for an investment
 22  5 made by a natural person, and for any other person reduces the
 22  6 carryforward period to three years.
 22  7    The division strikes a provision permitting the EDA
 22  8 to cooperate with small business development centers to
 22  9 disseminate information regarding the credits and to develop
 22 10 standard application forms, and requiring the EDA to distribute
 22 11 copies of the application forms to all community=based seed
 22 12 capital funds and potential individual investors.
 22 13    The division modifies the eligibility requirements for
 22 14 qualifying businesses.  The division strikes the requirement
 22 15 that a business have an owner that meets at least one of
 22 16 four qualifications relating to business education or
 22 17 business experience.  The division requires that a business
 22 18 be participating in an entrepreneurial assistance program,
 22 19 as defined in the division, but allows the EDA to waive this
 22 20 requirement if the business establishes that its owners,
 22 21 directors, officers, and employees have an appropriate level
 22 22 of experience such that an entrepreneurial assistance program
 22 23 would not materially change the prospects of the business.
 22 24 The EDA is allowed to consult with outside service providers
 22 25 in considering such a waiver.  The division increases from $5
 22 26 million to $10 million the maximum amount of net worth that
 22 27 a business may have to be considered a qualifying business.
 22 28 The division increases from $250,000 to $500,000 the amount of
 22 29 financing that a business must have in order to be considered a
 22 30 qualifying business, removes "near equity" from the types of
 22 31 financing that will be considered in that calculation, requires
 22 32 that the financing be secured at the time of application for
 22 33 the tax credits, and requires that the business have at least
 22 34 two investors at the time of application for the tax credits.
 22 35 These modified eligibility requirements apply to businesses
 23  1 that submit an application to the EDA to be registered as a
 23  2 qualifying business on or after the effective date of this
 23  3 division of the bill, and businesses that submitted such an
 23  4 application to the EDA before the effective date of this
 23  5 division of the bill shall be governed by current law.
 23  6    The division provides for the confidentiality of certain
 23  7 information with regard to the tax credit.  The identity of
 23  8 a qualifying business, the identity of an investor and the
 23  9 qualifying business in which the investor made an equity
 23 10 investment, and the total number and amount of tax credits
 23 11 issued shall be considered public information under Code
 23 12 chapter 22 (examination of public records), but any other
 23 13 information or record in the possession of the EDA with respect
 23 14 to the program shall be presumed by the EDA to be a trade secret
 23 15 protected under Code chapter 550 or common law and shall be
 23 16 kept confidential by the EDA unless otherwise ordered by a
 23 17 court.
 23 18    The division takes effect upon enactment and applies to
 23 19 equity investments in a qualifying business made on or after
 23 20 that date.  Equity investments in a qualifying business or
 23 21 community=based seed capital fund made prior to the effective
 23 22 date of the division shall be governed by current law.
 23 23    DIVISION III ==== ENTREPRENEUR INVESTMENT AWARDS PROGRAM.
 23 24  Division III amends the entrepreneur investment awards program
 23 25 administered by the EDA.  The division strikes provisions that
 23 26 prohibited the EDA from making awards under the program since
 23 27 July 1, 2014, and that required the EDA by December 31, 2014,
 23 28 to conduct a comprehensive review of the program and submit
 23 29 a report with specified information to the governor and the
 23 30 general assembly.
 23 31    The division modifies the purpose of the program to be
 23 32 to provide financial assistance to eligible entrepreneurial
 23 33 assistance providers (provider) that provide technical and
 23 34 financial assistance to entrepreneurs and start=up companies
 23 35 seeking to create, locate, or expand a business in Iowa.
 24  1 "Financial assistance" is defined in the division.
 24  2    The division changes the requirements for receiving an
 24  3 award.  To be eligible to receive an award under current
 24  4 law, an entrepreneurial assistance program must have been
 24  5 an Iowa=based business, expended at least $500,000 during
 24  6 the previous fiscal year to provide technical and financial
 24  7 assistance services that meet the broad=based needs of
 24  8 entrepreneurs seeking to create, locate, or expand a business
 24  9 in Iowa that intends to derive more than 10 percent of its
 24 10 gross sales from markets outside Iowa; and must have engaged
 24 11 and communicated with certain other programs, funding sources,
 24 12 and entities for its entrepreneur clients.  The division
 24 13 amends the eligibility for receiving financial assistance to
 24 14 require that a provider have its principal place of operations
 24 15 in Iowa and that the provider offer a comprehensive set of
 24 16 business development services to emerging and early=stage
 24 17 innovation companies to assist in the creation, location,
 24 18 growth, and long=term success of the company in Iowa.
 24 19 "Business development services" is defined in the division.
 24 20 Business development services may be performed at the physical
 24 21 location of the provider or the company and may be provided in
 24 22 consideration of equity participation in the company, a fee for
 24 23 services, or a membership agreement with the company.
 24 24    Under current law, the EDA board could approve, deny, or
 24 25 defer each application for a grant, and was required to award
 24 26 grants on a first=come, first=served basis.  The division
 24 27 specifies that the EDA board has the discretion to approve,
 24 28 deny, or defer each application for financial assistance and
 24 29 that the amount of financial assistance awarded to a provider
 24 30 is within the discretion of the EDA.  The division requires
 24 31 the EDA to award financial assistance on a competitive basis
 24 32 and allows the EDA to develop scoring criteria and establish
 24 33 minimum requirements for the receipt of a financial assistance
 24 34 award.
 24 35    In addition to the four factors relating to the provider's
 25  1 professional staff that the EDA may consider under current
 25  2 law in deciding whether to award financial assistance, the
 25  3 division provides that the EDA may also consider the service
 25  4 model and likelihood of success of the provider, the provider's
 25  5 similarity to other successful providers in the country, and
 25  6 the provider's financial need.
 25  7    The division modifies the maximum award amount for a
 25  8 recipient.  Under current law, a grant to an entrepreneur
 25  9 assistance program cannot exceed the lesser of 25 percent of
 25 10 the funds expended by the program during the previous fiscal
 25 11 year, 100 percent of the funds raised from certain persons
 25 12 by the program during the previous fiscal year, or $200,000.
 25 13 The division provides that the amount of financial assistance
 25 14 awarded to any one provider shall not exceed $200,000.
 25 15    The division modifies the permitted use of funds received
 25 16 under the program.  Under current law, grants are only
 25 17 permitted to be used for the purpose of operating costs
 25 18 incurred by the program.  The division specifies that financial
 25 19 assistance awarded to a provider shall only be used for
 25 20 the purpose of operating costs incurred by the provider in
 25 21 the provision of business development services to emerging
 25 22 and early=stage innovation companies in Iowa.  The division
 25 23 further requires that such financial assistance shall not be
 25 24 distributed to owners or investors of the company to which the
 25 25 business development services are being provided and shall not
 25 26 be provided to other persons assisting with the provision of
 25 27 the services.
 25 28    Under current law, an entrepreneurial assistance provider is
 25 29 required to accept client referrals from the EDA as a condition
 25 30 of receiving a grant.  The division provides that the EDA may
 25 31 make client referrals to eligible providers.
 25 32    DIVISION IV ==== MISCELLANEOUS CHANGES.  Division IV makes
 25 33 several miscellaneous changes to other EDA programs.  The
 25 34 division amends the sales and use tax refund available under
 25 35 the workforce housing tax incentive program.  That refund
 26  1 is available for sales and use tax paid prior to project
 26  2 completion, which is currently defined to mean the first date
 26  3 upon which the average annualized production of finished
 26  4 product for the preceding 90=day period at the manufacturing
 26  5 facility operated by the eligible business is at least 50
 26  6 percent of the initial design capacity of the facility.  The
 26  7 division amends the definition of "project completion" to mean
 26  8 the date on which the EDA notifies the department of revenue
 26  9 that all applicable requirements of a workforce housing tax
 26 10 incentive program agreement are satisfied.  This provision
 26 11 takes effect upon enactment and applies retroactively to July
 26 12 1, 2014, for all workforce housing tax incentive agreements
 26 13 entered into on or after that date.
 26 14    The division allows the EDA to extend the project
 26 15 completion date for a project awarded tax incentives under the
 26 16 redevelopment tax credit program and the housing enterprise
 26 17 zone tax incentives program if the property that is the subject
 26 18 of the project suffered a catastrophic fire during the 2014
 26 19 calendar year.
       LSB 1212HV (3) 86
       mm/sc
 18 25 chemical", "biomass feedstock", and other related terms are
 18 26 defined in the division.
 18 27    In order to qualify for the tax credit, a business must
 18 28 meet several requirements.  First, the business must be
 18 29 physically located in Iowa and operated for profit under
 18 30 single management.  Second, the business must not be an
 18 31 entity providing professional services, health care services,
 18 32 or medical treatments, or be engaged primarily in retail
 18 33 operations.  Third, the business must have organized, expanded,
 18 34 or located in Iowa on or after the effective date of the
 18 35 division.  Fourth, the business must not be, in the discretion
 19  1 of the EDA, ineligible under certain provisions relating to the
 19  2 relocation or reduction of business operations within Iowa.
 19  3 Fifth, the business must be in compliance with all agreements
 19  4 entered into under the program or other programs administered
 19  5 by the EDA.
 19  6    An eligible business seeking a tax credit is required
 19  7 to apply to the EDA during the calendar year following the
 19  8 calendar year in which the renewable chemicals are produced.
 19  9 The application must include the amount of renewable chemicals
 19 10 produced in Iowa from biomass feedstock by the eligible
 19 11 business during the calendar year, measured in pounds, and any
 19 12 other information reasonably required by the EDA in order to
 19 13 establish and verify eligibility under the program.  The EDA
 19 14 may accept applications on a continuous basis or may establish
 19 15 an annual application deadline.
 19 16    Before being issued a tax credit, an eligible business
 19 17 is required to enter into an agreement with the EDA for the
 19 18 successful completion of all requirements of the program.  The
 19 19 EDA is authorized to impose two compliance cost fees under the
 19 20 program.  The first fee equals $500 per agreement.  The second
 19 21 fee equals 0.5 percent of the value of the tax credit claimed
 19 22 pursuant to the agreement if the agreement has an aggregate tax
 19 23 credit value of $100,000 or greater.
 19 24    An eligible business that fails to comply with the
 19 25 requirements of the program or the terms of an agreement with
 19 26 the EDA may have its tax credits reduced, terminated, or
 19 27 rescinded, and may be subject to the repayment or recapture of
 19 28 claimed tax credits.
 19 29    Upon determining that all requirements of an agreement and
 19 30 the program have been fulfilled, the EDA shall issue a tax
 19 31 credit and related tax credit certificate to the eligible
 19 32 business in an amount equal to the product of $.05 multiplied
 19 33 by the number of pounds of renewable chemicals produced in Iowa
 19 34 from biomass feedstock by the eligible business during the
 19 35 calendar year.  Renewable chemicals produced by an eligible
 20  1 business prior to the effective date of the division, or
 20  2 prior to the date the business first qualifies as an eligible
 20  3 business, or after calendar year 2025, shall not qualify for
 20  4 the tax credit.
 20  5    The tax credit shall be claimed for the tax year during
 20  6 which the eligible business was issued the tax credit.  The tax
 20  7 credit may be claimed against the individual income tax and the
 20  8 corporate income tax.  The credit is refundable or may, at the
 20  9 election of the taxpayer, be carried forward for up to one tax
 20 10 year.   The tax credit shall not be transferred to any person.  A
 20 11 tax credit issued to a partnership, limited liability company,
 20 12 S corporation, cooperative organized under Code chapter 501
 20 13 and filing as a partnership for federal tax purposes, estate,
 20 14 or trust electing to have the income taxed directly to the
 20 15 individual may be claimed by the individual based upon the pro
 20 16 rata share of the individual's earnings from that entity.
 20 17    The division provides that the program is subject to the
 20 18 EDA's maximum aggregate tax credit cap of $170 million per
 20 19 fiscal year in Code section 15.119, and not more than $15
 20 20 million per fiscal year may be issued by the EDA under the
 20 21 program.  In addition, the maximum amount of tax credit that
 20 22 may be issued to an eligible business in any one calendar year
 20 23 shall not exceed $1 million or $500,000, depending on whether
 20 24 the eligible business has been operating in Iowa at the time of
 20 25 application for five or fewer years, or more than five years,
 20 26 respectively.  An eligible business shall not receive more than
 20 27 five tax credits under the program.  The EDA is required to
 20 28 issue tax credits on a first=come, first=served basis until the
 20 29 maximum amount of $15 million per fiscal year is reached.  If
 20 30 the amount of tax credits exceeds this amount in a fiscal year,
 20 31 the EDA is required to establish a wait list and give priority
 20 32 in subsequent years to the eligible businesses on the wait
 20 33 list.
 20 34    The division provides for the confidentiality of certain
 20 35 information under the program.  The identity of a tax credit
 21  1 recipient and the amount of the tax credit shall be considered
 21  2 public information under Code chapter 22 (examination of public
 21  3 records), but any other information or record in the possession
 21  4 of the EDA with respect to the program shall be presumed by
 21  5 the EDA to be a trade secret protected under Code chapter 550
 21  6 or common law and shall be kept confidential by the EDA unless
 21  7 otherwise ordered by a court.
 21  8    The division takes effect upon enactment and applies to
 21  9 renewable chemicals produced in Iowa from biomass feedstock on
 21 10 or after that date.  The division applies retroactively to tax
 21 11 years beginning on or after January 1, 2015.
 21 12    DIVISION II ==== ANGEL INVESTOR TAX CREDITS.   Division II
 21 13 makes several changes to the tax credit for investments in
 21 14 qualifying businesses and community=based seed capital funds,
 21 15 often referred to as the angel investor tax credits.  The
 21 16 division amends the purpose of the tax credit in Code section
 21 17 15E.41.  The division excludes investments in community=based
 21 18 seed capital funds from qualifying for the tax credit and
 21 19 makes several conforming amendments to remove references to
 21 20 community=based seed capital funds from the Code.
 21 21    The division modifies the amount and dollar limitation of
 21 22 the tax credit for a taxpayer.  The tax credit is increased
 21 23 from 20 percent to 25 percent of a taxpayer's equity investment
 21 24 in a qualifying business.  Under current law, a taxpayer cannot
 21 25 claim more than $50,000 of tax credit per investment in a
 21 26 qualifying business, and for each tax year a taxpayer and the
 21 27 taxpayer's affiliates cannot claim tax credits for more than
 21 28 five investments in five different qualifying businesses.  The
 21 29 division amends this dollar limitation to prohibit a natural
 21 30 person and the person's spouse, child, or sibling from claiming
 21 31 a combined amount of more than $100,000 in tax credits per tax
 21 32 year.
 21 33    The division also provides that no more than $500,000 in tax
 21 34 credits may be issued per tax year for equity investments in
 21 35 any one qualifying business.
 22  1 The division modifies the procedures for claiming the tax
 22  2 credit.  Under current law, the tax credit is not refundable
 22  3 but available for carryforward for up to five tax years.  The
 22  4 division makes the tax credit refundable for an investment
 22  5 made by a natural person, and for any other person reduces the
 22  6 carryforward period to three years.
 22  7    The division strikes a provision permitting the EDA
 22  8 to cooperate with small business development centers to
 22  9 disseminate information regarding the credits and to develop
 22 10 standard application forms, and requiring the EDA to distribute
 22 11 copies of the application forms to all community=based seed
 22 12 capital funds and potential individual investors.
 22 13    The division modifies the eligibility requirements for
 22 14 qualifying businesses.  The division strikes the requirement
 22 15 that a business have an owner that meets at least one of
 22 16 four qualifications relating to business education or
 22 17 business experience.  The division requires that a business
 22 18 be participating in an entrepreneurial assistance program,
 22 19 as defined in the division, but allows the EDA to waive this
 22 20 requirement if the business establishes that its owners,
 22 21 directors, officers, and employees have an appropriate level
 22 22 of experience such that an entrepreneurial assistance program
 22 23 would not materially change the prospects of the business.
 22 24 The EDA is allowed to consult with outside service providers
 22 25 in considering such a waiver.  The division increases from $5
 22 26 million to $10 million the maximum amount of net worth that
 22 27 a business may have to be considered a qualifying business.
 22 28 The division increases from $250,000 to $500,000 the amount of
 22 29 financing that a business must have in order to be considered a
 22 30 qualifying business, removes "near equity" from the types of
 22 31 financing that will be considered in that calculation, requires
 22 32 that the financing be secured at the time of application for
 22 33 the tax credits, and requires that the business have at least
 22 34 two investors at the time of application for the tax credits.
 22 35 These modified eligibility requirements apply to businesses
 23  1 that submit an application to the EDA to be registered as a
 23  2 qualifying business on or after the effective date of this
 23  3 division of the bill, and businesses that submitted such an
 23  4 application to the EDA before the effective date of this
 23  5 division of the bill shall be governed by current law.
 23  6    The division provides for the confidentiality of certain
 23  7 information with regard to the tax credit.  The identity of
 23  8 a qualifying business, the identity of an investor and the
 23  9 qualifying business in which the investor made an equity
 23 10 investment, and the total number and amount of tax credits
 23 11 issued shall be considered public information under Code
 23 12 chapter 22 (examination of public records), but any other
 23 13 information or record in the possession of the EDA with respect
 23 14 to the program shall be presumed by the EDA to be a trade secret
 23 15 protected under Code chapter 550 or common law and shall be
 23 16 kept confidential by the EDA unless otherwise ordered by a
 23 17 court.
 23 18    The division takes effect upon enactment and applies to
 23 19 equity investments in a qualifying business made on or after
 23 20 that date.  Equity investments in a qualifying business or
 23 21 community=based seed capital fund made prior to the effective
 23 22 date of the division shall be governed by current law.
 23 23    DIVISION III ==== ENTREPRENEUR INVESTMENT AWARDS PROGRAM.
 23 24  Division III amends the entrepreneur investment awards program
 23 25 administered by the EDA.  The division strikes provisions that
 23 26 prohibited the EDA from making awards under the program since
 23 27 July 1, 2014, and that required the EDA by December 31, 2014,
 23 28 to conduct a comprehensive review of the program and submit
 23 29 a report with specified information to the governor and the
 23 30 general assembly.
 23 31    The division modifies the purpose of the program to be
 23 32 to provide financial assistance to eligible entrepreneurial
 23 33 assistance providers (provider) that provide technical and
 23 34 financial assistance to entrepreneurs and start=up companies
 23 35 seeking to create, locate, or expand a business in Iowa.
 24  1 "Financial assistance" is defined in the division.
 24  2    The division changes the requirements for receiving an
 24  3 award.  To be eligible to receive an award under current
 24  4 law, an entrepreneurial assistance program must have been
 24  5 an Iowa=based business, expended at least $500,000 during
 24  6 the previous fiscal year to provide technical and financial
 24  7 assistance services that meet the broad=based needs of
 24  8 entrepreneurs seeking to create, locate, or expand a business
 24  9 in Iowa that intends to derive more than 10 percent of its
 24 10 gross sales from markets outside Iowa; and must have engaged
 24 11 and communicated with certain other programs, funding sources,
 24 12 and entities for its entrepreneur clients.  The division
 24 13 amends the eligibility for receiving financial assistance to
 24 14 require that a provider have its principal place of operations
 24 15 in Iowa and that the provider offer a comprehensive set of
 24 16 business development services to emerging and early=stage
 24 17 innovation companies to assist in the creation, location,
 24 18 growth, and long=term success of the company in Iowa.
 24 19 "Business development services" is defined in the division.
 24 20 Business development services may be performed at the physical
 24 21 location of the provider or the company and may be provided in
 24 22 consideration of equity participation in the company, a fee for
 24 23 services, or a membership agreement with the company.
 24 24    Under current law, the EDA board could approve, deny, or
 24 25 defer each application for a grant, and was required to award
 24 26 grants on a first=come, first=served basis.  The division
 24 27 specifies that the EDA board has the discretion to approve,
 24 28 deny, or defer each application for financial assistance and
 24 29 that the amount of financial assistance awarded to a provider
 24 30 is within the discretion of the EDA.  The division requires
 24 31 the EDA to award financial assistance on a competitive basis
 24 32 and allows the EDA to develop scoring criteria and establish
 24 33 minimum requirements for the receipt of a financial assistance
 24 34 award.
 24 35    In addition to the four factors relating to the provider's
 25  1 professional staff that the EDA may consider under current
 25  2 law in deciding whether to award financial assistance, the
 25  3 division provides that the EDA may also consider the service
 25  4 model and likelihood of success of the provider, the provider's
 25  5 similarity to other successful providers in the country, and
 25  6 the provider's financial need.
 25  7    The division modifies the maximum award amount for a
 25  8 recipient.  Under current law, a grant to an entrepreneur
 25  9 assistance program cannot exceed the lesser of 25 percent of
 25 10 the funds expended by the program during the previous fiscal
 25 11 year, 100 percent of the funds raised from certain persons
 25 12 by the program during the previous fiscal year, or $200,000.
 25 13 The division provides that the amount of financial assistance
 25 14 awarded to any one provider shall not exceed $200,000.
 25 15    The division modifies the permitted use of funds received
 25 16 under the program.  Under current law, grants are only
 25 17 permitted to be used for the purpose of operating costs
 25 18 incurred by the program.  The division specifies that financial
 25 19 assistance awarded to a provider shall only be used for
 25 20 the purpose of operating costs incurred by the provider in
 25 21 the provision of business development services to emerging
 25 22 and early=stage innovation companies in Iowa.  The division
 25 23 further requires that such financial assistance shall not be
 25 24 distributed to owners or investors of the company to which the
 25 25 business development services are being provided and shall not
 25 26 be provided to other persons assisting with the provision of
 25 27 the services.
 25 28    Under current law, an entrepreneurial assistance provider is
 25 29 required to accept client referrals from the EDA as a condition
 25 30 of receiving a grant.  The division provides that the EDA may
 25 31 make client referrals to eligible providers.
 25 32    DIVISION IV ==== MISCELLANEOUS CHANGES.  Division IV makes
 25 33 several miscellaneous changes to other EDA programs.  The
 25 34 division amends the sales and use tax refund available under
 25 35 the workforce housing tax incentive program.  That refund
 26  1 is available for sales and use tax paid prior to project
 26  2 completion, which is currently defined to mean the first date
 26  3 upon which the average annualized production of finished
 26  4 product for the preceding 90=day period at the manufacturing
 26  5 facility operated by the eligible business is at least 50
 26  6 percent of the initial design capacity of the facility.  The
 26  7 division amends the definition of "project completion" to mean
 26  8 the date on which the EDA notifies the department of revenue
 26  9 that all applicable requirements of a workforce housing tax
 26 10 incentive program agreement are satisfied.  This provision
 26 11 takes effect upon enactment and applies retroactively to July
 26 12 1, 2014, for all workforce housing tax incentive agreements
 26 13 entered into on or after that date.
 26 14    The division allows the EDA to extend the project
 26 15 completion date for a project awarded tax incentives under the
 26 16 redevelopment tax credit program and the housing enterprise
 26 17 zone tax incentives program if the property that is the subject
 26 18 of the project suffered a catastrophic fire during the 2014
 26 19 calendar year.
       LSB 1212HV (3) 86
       mm/sc
 18 26 defined in the division.
 18 27    In order to qualify for the tax credit, a business must
 18 28 meet several requirements.  First, the business must be
 18 29 physically located in Iowa and operated for profit under
 18 30 single management.  Second, the business must not be an
 18 31 entity providing professional services, health care services,
 18 32 or medical treatments, or be engaged primarily in retail
 18 33 operations.  Third, the business must have organized, expanded,
 18 34 or located in Iowa on or after the effective date of the
 18 35 division.  Fourth, the business must not be, in the discretion
 19  1 of the EDA, ineligible under certain provisions relating to the
 19  2 relocation or reduction of business operations within Iowa.
 19  3 Fifth, the business must be in compliance with all agreements
 19  4 entered into under the program or other programs administered
 19  5 by the EDA.
 19  6    An eligible business seeking a tax credit is required
 19  7 to apply to the EDA during the calendar year following the
 19  8 calendar year in which the renewable chemicals are produced.
 19  9 The application must include the amount of renewable chemicals
 19 10 produced in Iowa from biomass feedstock by the eligible
 19 11 business during the calendar year, measured in pounds, and any
 19 12 other information reasonably required by the EDA in order to
 19 13 establish and verify eligibility under the program.  The EDA
 19 14 may accept applications on a continuous basis or may establish
 19 15 an annual application deadline.
 19 16    Before being issued a tax credit, an eligible business
 19 17 is required to enter into an agreement with the EDA for the
 19 18 successful completion of all requirements of the program.  The
 19 19 EDA is authorized to impose two compliance cost fees under the
 19 20 program.  The first fee equals $500 per agreement.  The second
 19 21 fee equals 0.5 percent of the value of the tax credit claimed
 19 22 pursuant to the agreement if the agreement has an aggregate tax
 19 23 credit value of $100,000 or greater.
 19 24    An eligible business that fails to comply with the
 19 25 requirements of the program or the terms of an agreement with
 19 26 the EDA may have its tax credits reduced, terminated, or
 19 27 rescinded, and may be subject to the repayment or recapture of
 19 28 claimed tax credits.
 19 29    Upon determining that all requirements of an agreement and
 19 30 the program have been fulfilled, the EDA shall issue a tax
 19 31 credit and related tax credit certificate to the eligible
 19 32 business in an amount equal to the product of $.05 multiplied
 19 33 by the number of pounds of renewable chemicals produced in Iowa
 19 34 from biomass feedstock by the eligible business during the
 19 35 calendar year.  Renewable chemicals produced by an eligible
 20  1 business prior to the effective date of the division, or
 20  2 prior to the date the business first qualifies as an eligible
 20  3 business, or after calendar year 2025, shall not qualify for
 20  4 the tax credit.
 20  5    The tax credit shall be claimed for the tax year during
 20  6 which the eligible business was issued the tax credit.  The tax
 20  7 credit may be claimed against the individual income tax and the
 20  8 corporate income tax.  The credit is refundable or may, at the
 20  9 election of the taxpayer, be carried forward for up to one tax
 20 10 year.   The tax credit shall not be transferred to any person.  A
 20 11 tax credit issued to a partnership, limited liability company,
 20 12 S corporation, cooperative organized under Code chapter 501
 20 13 and filing as a partnership for federal tax purposes, estate,
 20 14 or trust electing to have the income taxed directly to the
 20 15 individual may be claimed by the individual based upon the pro
 20 16 rata share of the individual's earnings from that entity.
 20 17    The division provides that the program is subject to the
 20 18 EDA's maximum aggregate tax credit cap of $170 million per
 20 19 fiscal year in Code section 15.119, and not more than $15
 20 20 million per fiscal year may be issued by the EDA under the
 20 21 program.  In addition, the maximum amount of tax credit that
 20 22 may be issued to an eligible business in any one calendar year
 20 23 shall not exceed $1 million or $500,000, depending on whether
 20 24 the eligible business has been operating in Iowa at the time of
 20 25 application for five or fewer years, or more than five years,
 20 26 respectively.  An eligible business shall not receive more than
 20 27 five tax credits under the program.  The EDA is required to
 20 28 issue tax credits on a first=come, first=served basis until the
 20 29 maximum amount of $15 million per fiscal year is reached.  If
 20 30 the amount of tax credits exceeds this amount in a fiscal year,
 20 31 the EDA is required to establish a wait list and give priority
 20 32 in subsequent years to the eligible businesses on the wait
 20 33 list.
 20 34    The division provides for the confidentiality of certain
 20 35 information under the program.  The identity of a tax credit
 21  1 recipient and the amount of the tax credit shall be considered
 21  2 public information under Code chapter 22 (examination of public
 21  3 records), but any other information or record in the possession
 21  4 of the EDA with respect to the program shall be presumed by
 21  5 the EDA to be a trade secret protected under Code chapter 550
 21  6 or common law and shall be kept confidential by the EDA unless
 21  7 otherwise ordered by a court.
 21  8    The division takes effect upon enactment and applies to
 21  9 renewable chemicals produced in Iowa from biomass feedstock on
 21 10 or after that date.  The division applies retroactively to tax
 21 11 years beginning on or after January 1, 2015.
 21 12    DIVISION II ==== ANGEL INVESTOR TAX CREDITS.   Division II
 21 13 makes several changes to the tax credit for investments in
 21 14 qualifying businesses and community=based seed capital funds,
 21 15 often referred to as the angel investor tax credits.  The
 21 16 division amends the purpose of the tax credit in Code section
 21 17 15E.41.  The division excludes investments in community=based
 21 18 seed capital funds from qualifying for the tax credit and
 21 19 makes several conforming amendments to remove references to
 21 20 community=based seed capital funds from the Code.
 21 21    The division modifies the amount and dollar limitation of
 21 22 the tax credit for a taxpayer.  The tax credit is increased
 21 23 from 20 percent to 25 percent of a taxpayer's equity investment
 21 24 in a qualifying business.  Under current law, a taxpayer cannot
 21 25 claim more than $50,000 of tax credit per investment in a
 21 26 qualifying business, and for each tax year a taxpayer and the
 21 27 taxpayer's affiliates cannot claim tax credits for more than
 21 28 five investments in five different qualifying businesses.  The
 21 29 division amends this dollar limitation to prohibit a natural
 21 30 person and the person's spouse, child, or sibling from claiming
 21 31 a combined amount of more than $100,000 in tax credits per tax
 21 32 year.
 21 33    The division also provides that no more than $500,000 in tax
 21 34 credits may be issued per tax year for equity investments in
 21 35 any one qualifying business.
 22  1 The division modifies the procedures for claiming the tax
 22  2 credit.  Under current law, the tax credit is not refundable
 22  3 but available for carryforward for up to five tax years.  The
 22  4 division makes the tax credit refundable for an investment
 22  5 made by a natural person, and for any other person reduces the
 22  6 carryforward period to three years.
 22  7    The division strikes a provision permitting the EDA
 22  8 to cooperate with small business development centers to
 22  9 disseminate information regarding the credits and to develop
 22 10 standard application forms, and requiring the EDA to distribute
 22 11 copies of the application forms to all community=based seed
 22 12 capital funds and potential individual investors.
 22 13    The division modifies the eligibility requirements for
 22 14 qualifying businesses.  The division strikes the requirement
 22 15 that a business have an owner that meets at least one of
 22 16 four qualifications relating to business education or
 22 17 business experience.  The division requires that a business
 22 18 be participating in an entrepreneurial assistance program,
 22 19 as defined in the division, but allows the EDA to waive this
 22 20 requirement if the business establishes that its owners,
 22 21 directors, officers, and employees have an appropriate level
 22 22 of experience such that an entrepreneurial assistance program
 22 23 would not materially change the prospects of the business.
 22 24 The EDA is allowed to consult with outside service providers
 22 25 in considering such a waiver.  The division increases from $5
 22 26 million to $10 million the maximum amount of net worth that
 22 27 a business may have to be considered a qualifying business.
 22 28 The division increases from $250,000 to $500,000 the amount of
 22 29 financing that a business must have in order to be considered a
 22 30 qualifying business, removes "near equity" from the types of
 22 31 financing that will be considered in that calculation, requires
 22 32 that the financing be secured at the time of application for
 22 33 the tax credits, and requires that the business have at least
 22 34 two investors at the time of application for the tax credits.
 22 35 These modified eligibility requirements apply to businesses
 23  1 that submit an application to the EDA to be registered as a
 23  2 qualifying business on or after the effective date of this
 23  3 division of the bill, and businesses that submitted such an
 23  4 application to the EDA before the effective date of this
 23  5 division of the bill shall be governed by current law.
 23  6    The division provides for the confidentiality of certain
 23  7 information with regard to the tax credit.  The identity of
 23  8 a qualifying business, the identity of an investor and the
 23  9 qualifying business in which the investor made an equity
 23 10 investment, and the total number and amount of tax credits
 23 11 issued shall be considered public information under Code
 23 12 chapter 22 (examination of public records), but any other
 23 13 information or record in the possession of the EDA with respect
 23 14 to the program shall be presumed by the EDA to be a trade secret
 23 15 protected under Code chapter 550 or common law and shall be
 23 16 kept confidential by the EDA unless otherwise ordered by a
 23 17 court.
 23 18    The division takes effect upon enactment and applies to
 23 19 equity investments in a qualifying business made on or after
 23 20 that date.  Equity investments in a qualifying business or
 23 21 community=based seed capital fund made prior to the effective
 23 22 date of the division shall be governed by current law.
 23 23    DIVISION III ==== ENTREPRENEUR INVESTMENT AWARDS PROGRAM.
 23 24  Division III amends the entrepreneur investment awards program
 23 25 administered by the EDA.  The division strikes provisions that
 23 26 prohibited the EDA from making awards under the program since
 23 27 July 1, 2014, and that required the EDA by December 31, 2014,
 23 28 to conduct a comprehensive review of the program and submit
 23 29 a report with specified information to the governor and the
 23 30 general assembly.
 23 31    The division modifies the purpose of the program to be
 23 32 to provide financial assistance to eligible entrepreneurial
 23 33 assistance providers (provider) that provide technical and
 23 34 financial assistance to entrepreneurs and start=up companies
 23 35 seeking to create, locate, or expand a business in Iowa.
 24  1 "Financial assistance" is defined in the division.
 24  2    The division changes the requirements for receiving an
 24  3 award.  To be eligible to receive an award under current
 24  4 law, an entrepreneurial assistance program must have been
 24  5 an Iowa=based business, expended at least $500,000 during
 24  6 the previous fiscal year to provide technical and financial
 24  7 assistance services that meet the broad=based needs of
 24  8 entrepreneurs seeking to create, locate, or expand a business
 24  9 in Iowa that intends to derive more than 10 percent of its
 24 10 gross sales from markets outside Iowa; and must have engaged
 24 11 and communicated with certain other programs, funding sources,
 24 12 and entities for its entrepreneur clients.  The division
 24 13 amends the eligibility for receiving financial assistance to
 24 14 require that a provider have its principal place of operations
 24 15 in Iowa and that the provider offer a comprehensive set of
 24 16 business development services to emerging and early=stage
 24 17 innovation companies to assist in the creation, location,
 24 18 growth, and long=term success of the company in Iowa.
 24 19 "Business development services" is defined in the division.
 24 20 Business development services may be performed at the physical
 24 21 location of the provider or the company and may be provided in
 24 22 consideration of equity participation in the company, a fee for
 24 23 services, or a membership agreement with the company.
 24 24    Under current law, the EDA board could approve, deny, or
 24 25 defer each application for a grant, and was required to award
 24 26 grants on a first=come, first=served basis.  The division
 24 27 specifies that the EDA board has the discretion to approve,
 24 28 deny, or defer each application for financial assistance and
 24 29 that the amount of financial assistance awarded to a provider
 24 30 is within the discretion of the EDA.  The division requires
 24 31 the EDA to award financial assistance on a competitive basis
 24 32 and allows the EDA to develop scoring criteria and establish
 24 33 minimum requirements for the receipt of a financial assistance
 24 34 award.
 24 35    In addition to the four factors relating to the provider's
 25  1 professional staff that the EDA may consider under current
 25  2 law in deciding whether to award financial assistance, the
 25  3 division provides that the EDA may also consider the service
 25  4 model and likelihood of success of the provider, the provider's
 25  5 similarity to other successful providers in the country, and
 25  6 the provider's financial need.
 25  7    The division modifies the maximum award amount for a
 25  8 recipient.  Under current law, a grant to an entrepreneur
 25  9 assistance program cannot exceed the lesser of 25 percent of
 25 10 the funds expended by the program during the previous fiscal
 25 11 year, 100 percent of the funds raised from certain persons
 25 12 by the program during the previous fiscal year, or $200,000.
 25 13 The division provides that the amount of financial assistance
 25 14 awarded to any one provider shall not exceed $200,000.
 25 15    The division modifies the permitted use of funds received
 25 16 under the program.  Under current law, grants are only
 25 17 permitted to be used for the purpose of operating costs
 25 18 incurred by the program.  The division specifies that financial
 25 19 assistance awarded to a provider shall only be used for
 25 20 the purpose of operating costs incurred by the provider in
 25 21 the provision of business development services to emerging
 25 22 and early=stage innovation companies in Iowa.  The division
 25 23 further requires that such financial assistance shall not be
 25 24 distributed to owners or investors of the company to which the
 25 25 business development services are being provided and shall not
 25 26 be provided to other persons assisting with the provision of
 25 27 the services.
 25 28    Under current law, an entrepreneurial assistance provider is
 25 29 required to accept client referrals from the EDA as a condition
 25 30 of receiving a grant.  The division provides that the EDA may
 25 31 make client referrals to eligible providers.
 25 32    DIVISION IV ==== MISCELLANEOUS CHANGES.  Division IV makes
 25 33 several miscellaneous changes to other EDA programs.  The
 25 34 division amends the sales and use tax refund available under
 25 35 the workforce housing tax incentive program.  That refund
 26  1 is available for sales and use tax paid prior to project
 26  2 completion, which is currently defined to mean the first date
 26  3 upon which the average annualized production of finished
 26  4 product for the preceding 90=day period at the manufacturing
 26  5 facility operated by the eligible business is at least 50
 26  6 percent of the initial design capacity of the facility.  The
 26  7 division amends the definition of "project completion" to mean
 26  8 the date on which the EDA notifies the department of revenue
 26  9 that all applicable requirements of a workforce housing tax
 26 10 incentive program agreement are satisfied.  This provision
 26 11 takes effect upon enactment and applies retroactively to July
 26 12 1, 2014, for all workforce housing tax incentive agreements
 26 13 entered into on or after that date.
 26 14    The division allows the EDA to extend the project
 26 15 completion date for a project awarded tax incentives under the
 26 16 redevelopment tax credit program and the housing enterprise
 26 17 zone tax incentives program if the property that is the subject
 26 18 of the project suffered a catastrophic fire during the 2014
 26 19 calendar year.
       LSB 1212HV (3) 86
       mm/sc
 18 27    In order to qualify for the tax credit, a business must
 18 28 meet several requirements.  First, the business must be
 18 29 physically located in Iowa and operated for profit under
 18 30 single management.  Second, the business must not be an
 18 31 entity providing professional services, health care services,
 18 32 or medical treatments, or be engaged primarily in retail
 18 33 operations.  Third, the business must have organized, expanded,
 18 34 or located in Iowa on or after the effective date of the
 18 35 division.  Fourth, the business must not be, in the discretion
 19  1 of the EDA, ineligible under certain provisions relating to the
 19  2 relocation or reduction of business operations within Iowa.
 19  3 Fifth, the business must be in compliance with all agreements
 19  4 entered into under the program or other programs administered
 19  5 by the EDA.
 19  6    An eligible business seeking a tax credit is required
 19  7 to apply to the EDA during the calendar year following the
 19  8 calendar year in which the renewable chemicals are produced.
 19  9 The application must include the amount of renewable chemicals
 19 10 produced in Iowa from biomass feedstock by the eligible
 19 11 business during the calendar year, measured in pounds, and any
 19 12 other information reasonably required by the EDA in order to
 19 13 establish and verify eligibility under the program.  The EDA
 19 14 may accept applications on a continuous basis or may establish
 19 15 an annual application deadline.
 19 16    Before being issued a tax credit, an eligible business
 19 17 is required to enter into an agreement with the EDA for the
 19 18 successful completion of all requirements of the program.  The
 19 19 EDA is authorized to impose two compliance cost fees under the
 19 20 program.  The first fee equals $500 per agreement.  The second
 19 21 fee equals 0.5 percent of the value of the tax credit claimed
 19 22 pursuant to the agreement if the agreement has an aggregate tax
 19 23 credit value of $100,000 or greater.
 19 24    An eligible business that fails to comply with the
 19 25 requirements of the program or the terms of an agreement with
 19 26 the EDA may have its tax credits reduced, terminated, or
 19 27 rescinded, and may be subject to the repayment or recapture of
 19 28 claimed tax credits.
 19 29    Upon determining that all requirements of an agreement and
 19 30 the program have been fulfilled, the EDA shall issue a tax
 19 31 credit and related tax credit certificate to the eligible
 19 32 business in an amount equal to the product of $.05 multiplied
 19 33 by the number of pounds of renewable chemicals produced in Iowa
 19 34 from biomass feedstock by the eligible business during the
 19 35 calendar year.  Renewable chemicals produced by an eligible
 20  1 business prior to the effective date of the division, or
 20  2 prior to the date the business first qualifies as an eligible
 20  3 business, or after calendar year 2025, shall not qualify for
 20  4 the tax credit.
 20  5    The tax credit shall be claimed for the tax year during
 20  6 which the eligible business was issued the tax credit.  The tax
 20  7 credit may be claimed against the individual income tax and the
 20  8 corporate income tax.  The credit is refundable or may, at the
 20  9 election of the taxpayer, be carried forward for up to one tax
 20 10 year.   The tax credit shall not be transferred to any person.  A
 20 11 tax credit issued to a partnership, limited liability company,
 20 12 S corporation, cooperative organized under Code chapter 501
 20 13 and filing as a partnership for federal tax purposes, estate,
 20 14 or trust electing to have the income taxed directly to the
 20 15 individual may be claimed by the individual based upon the pro
 20 16 rata share of the individual's earnings from that entity.
 20 17    The division provides that the program is subject to the
 20 18 EDA's maximum aggregate tax credit cap of $170 million per
 20 19 fiscal year in Code section 15.119, and not more than $15
 20 20 million per fiscal year may be issued by the EDA under the
 20 21 program.  In addition, the maximum amount of tax credit that
 20 22 may be issued to an eligible business in any one calendar year
 20 23 shall not exceed $1 million or $500,000, depending on whether
 20 24 the eligible business has been operating in Iowa at the time of
 20 25 application for five or fewer years, or more than five years,
 20 26 respectively.  An eligible business shall not receive more than
 20 27 five tax credits under the program.  The EDA is required to
 20 28 issue tax credits on a first=come, first=served basis until the
 20 29 maximum amount of $15 million per fiscal year is reached.  If
 20 30 the amount of tax credits exceeds this amount in a fiscal year,
 20 31 the EDA is required to establish a wait list and give priority
 20 32 in subsequent years to the eligible businesses on the wait
 20 33 list.
 20 34    The division provides for the confidentiality of certain
 20 35 information under the program.  The identity of a tax credit
 21  1 recipient and the amount of the tax credit shall be considered
 21  2 public information under Code chapter 22 (examination of public
 21  3 records), but any other information or record in the possession
 21  4 of the EDA with respect to the program shall be presumed by
 21  5 the EDA to be a trade secret protected under Code chapter 550
 21  6 or common law and shall be kept confidential by the EDA unless
 21  7 otherwise ordered by a court.
 21  8    The division takes effect upon enactment and applies to
 21  9 renewable chemicals produced in Iowa from biomass feedstock on
 21 10 or after that date.  The division applies retroactively to tax
 21 11 years beginning on or after January 1, 2015.
 21 12    DIVISION II ==== ANGEL INVESTOR TAX CREDITS.   Division II
 21 13 makes several changes to the tax credit for investments in
 21 14 qualifying businesses and community=based seed capital funds,
 21 15 often referred to as the angel investor tax credits.  The
 21 16 division amends the purpose of the tax credit in Code section
 21 17 15E.41.  The division excludes investments in community=based
 21 18 seed capital funds from qualifying for the tax credit and
 21 19 makes several conforming amendments to remove references to
 21 20 community=based seed capital funds from the Code.
 21 21    The division modifies the amount and dollar limitation of
 21 22 the tax credit for a taxpayer.  The tax credit is increased
 21 23 from 20 percent to 25 percent of a taxpayer's equity investment
 21 24 in a qualifying business.  Under current law, a taxpayer cannot
 21 25 claim more than $50,000 of tax credit per investment in a
 21 26 qualifying business, and for each tax year a taxpayer and the
 21 27 taxpayer's affiliates cannot claim tax credits for more than
 21 28 five investments in five different qualifying businesses.  The
 21 29 division amends this dollar limitation to prohibit a natural
 21 30 person and the person's spouse, child, or sibling from claiming
 21 31 a combined amount of more than $100,000 in tax credits per tax
 21 32 year.
 21 33    The division also provides that no more than $500,000 in tax
 21 34 credits may be issued per tax year for equity investments in
 21 35 any one qualifying business.
 22  1 The division modifies the procedures for claiming the tax
 22  2 credit.  Under current law, the tax credit is not refundable
 22  3 but available for carryforward for up to five tax years.  The
 22  4 division makes the tax credit refundable for an investment
 22  5 made by a natural person, and for any other person reduces the
 22  6 carryforward period to three years.
 22  7    The division strikes a provision permitting the EDA
 22  8 to cooperate with small business development centers to
 22  9 disseminate information regarding the credits and to develop
 22 10 standard application forms, and requiring the EDA to distribute
 22 11 copies of the application forms to all community=based seed
 22 12 capital funds and potential individual investors.
 22 13    The division modifies the eligibility requirements for
 22 14 qualifying businesses.  The division strikes the requirement
 22 15 that a business have an owner that meets at least one of
 22 16 four qualifications relating to business education or
 22 17 business experience.  The division requires that a business
 22 18 be participating in an entrepreneurial assistance program,
 22 19 as defined in the division, but allows the EDA to waive this
 22 20 requirement if the business establishes that its owners,
 22 21 directors, officers, and employees have an appropriate level
 22 22 of experience such that an entrepreneurial assistance program
 22 23 would not materially change the prospects of the business.
 22 24 The EDA is allowed to consult with outside service providers
 22 25 in considering such a waiver.  The division increases from $5
 22 26 million to $10 million the maximum amount of net worth that
 22 27 a business may have to be considered a qualifying business.
 22 28 The division increases from $250,000 to $500,000 the amount of
 22 29 financing that a business must have in order to be considered a
 22 30 qualifying business, removes "near equity" from the types of
 22 31 financing that will be considered in that calculation, requires
 22 32 that the financing be secured at the time of application for
 22 33 the tax credits, and requires that the business have at least
 22 34 two investors at the time of application for the tax credits.
 22 35 These modified eligibility requirements apply to businesses
 23  1 that submit an application to the EDA to be registered as a
 23  2 qualifying business on or after the effective date of this
 23  3 division of the bill, and businesses that submitted such an
 23  4 application to the EDA before the effective date of this
 23  5 division of the bill shall be governed by current law.
 23  6    The division provides for the confidentiality of certain
 23  7 information with regard to the tax credit.  The identity of
 23  8 a qualifying business, the identity of an investor and the
 23  9 qualifying business in which the investor made an equity
 23 10 investment, and the total number and amount of tax credits
 23 11 issued shall be considered public information under Code
 23 12 chapter 22 (examination of public records), but any other
 23 13 information or record in the possession of the EDA with respect
 23 14 to the program shall be presumed by the EDA to be a trade secret
 23 15 protected under Code chapter 550 or common law and shall be
 23 16 kept confidential by the EDA unless otherwise ordered by a
 23 17 court.
 23 18    The division takes effect upon enactment and applies to
 23 19 equity investments in a qualifying business made on or after
 23 20 that date.  Equity investments in a qualifying business or
 23 21 community=based seed capital fund made prior to the effective
 23 22 date of the division shall be governed by current law.
 23 23    DIVISION III ==== ENTREPRENEUR INVESTMENT AWARDS PROGRAM.
 23 24  Division III amends the entrepreneur investment awards program
 23 25 administered by the EDA.  The division strikes provisions that
 23 26 prohibited the EDA from making awards under the program since
 23 27 July 1, 2014, and that required the EDA by December 31, 2014,
 23 28 to conduct a comprehensive review of the program and submit
 23 29 a report with specified information to the governor and the
 23 30 general assembly.
 23 31    The division modifies the purpose of the program to be
 23 32 to provide financial assistance to eligible entrepreneurial
 23 33 assistance providers (provider) that provide technical and
 23 34 financial assistance to entrepreneurs and start=up companies
 23 35 seeking to create, locate, or expand a business in Iowa.
 24  1 "Financial assistance" is defined in the division.
 24  2    The division changes the requirements for receiving an
 24  3 award.  To be eligible to receive an award under current
 24  4 law, an entrepreneurial assistance program must have been
 24  5 an Iowa=based business, expended at least $500,000 during
 24  6 the previous fiscal year to provide technical and financial
 24  7 assistance services that meet the broad=based needs of
 24  8 entrepreneurs seeking to create, locate, or expand a business
 24  9 in Iowa that intends to derive more than 10 percent of its
 24 10 gross sales from markets outside Iowa; and must have engaged
 24 11 and communicated with certain other programs, funding sources,
 24 12 and entities for its entrepreneur clients.  The division
 24 13 amends the eligibility for receiving financial assistance to
 24 14 require that a provider have its principal place of operations
 24 15 in Iowa and that the provider offer a comprehensive set of
 24 16 business development services to emerging and early=stage
 24 17 innovation companies to assist in the creation, location,
 24 18 growth, and long=term success of the company in Iowa.
 24 19 "Business development services" is defined in the division.
 24 20 Business development services may be performed at the physical
 24 21 location of the provider or the company and may be provided in
 24 22 consideration of equity participation in the company, a fee for
 24 23 services, or a membership agreement with the company.
 24 24    Under current law, the EDA board could approve, deny, or
 24 25 defer each application for a grant, and was required to award
 24 26 grants on a first=come, first=served basis.  The division
 24 27 specifies that the EDA board has the discretion to approve,
 24 28 deny, or defer each application for financial assistance and
 24 29 that the amount of financial assistance awarded to a provider
 24 30 is within the discretion of the EDA.  The division requires
 24 31 the EDA to award financial assistance on a competitive basis
 24 32 and allows the EDA to develop scoring criteria and establish
 24 33 minimum requirements for the receipt of a financial assistance
 24 34 award.
 24 35    In addition to the four factors relating to the provider's
 25  1 professional staff that the EDA may consider under current
 25  2 law in deciding whether to award financial assistance, the
 25  3 division provides that the EDA may also consider the service
 25  4 model and likelihood of success of the provider, the provider's
 25  5 similarity to other successful providers in the country, and
 25  6 the provider's financial need.
 25  7    The division modifies the maximum award amount for a
 25  8 recipient.  Under current law, a grant to an entrepreneur
 25  9 assistance program cannot exceed the lesser of 25 percent of
 25 10 the funds expended by the program during the previous fiscal
 25 11 year, 100 percent of the funds raised from certain persons
 25 12 by the program during the previous fiscal year, or $200,000.
 25 13 The division provides that the amount of financial assistance
 25 14 awarded to any one provider shall not exceed $200,000.
 25 15    The division modifies the permitted use of funds received
 25 16 under the program.  Under current law, grants are only
 25 17 permitted to be used for the purpose of operating costs
 25 18 incurred by the program.  The division specifies that financial
 25 19 assistance awarded to a provider shall only be used for
 25 20 the purpose of operating costs incurred by the provider in
 25 21 the provision of business development services to emerging
 25 22 and early=stage innovation companies in Iowa.  The division
 25 23 further requires that such financial assistance shall not be
 25 24 distributed to owners or investors of the company to which the
 25 25 business development services are being provided and shall not
 25 26 be provided to other persons assisting with the provision of
 25 27 the services.
 25 28    Under current law, an entrepreneurial assistance provider is
 25 29 required to accept client referrals from the EDA as a condition
 25 30 of receiving a grant.  The division provides that the EDA may
 25 31 make client referrals to eligible providers.
 25 32    DIVISION IV ==== MISCELLANEOUS CHANGES.  Division IV makes
 25 33 several miscellaneous changes to other EDA programs.  The
 25 34 division amends the sales and use tax refund available under
 25 35 the workforce housing tax incentive program.  That refund
 26  1 is available for sales and use tax paid prior to project
 26  2 completion, which is currently defined to mean the first date
 26  3 upon which the average annualized production of finished
 26  4 product for the preceding 90=day period at the manufacturing
 26  5 facility operated by the eligible business is at least 50
 26  6 percent of the initial design capacity of the facility.  The
 26  7 division amends the definition of "project completion" to mean
 26  8 the date on which the EDA notifies the department of revenue
 26  9 that all applicable requirements of a workforce housing tax
 26 10 incentive program agreement are satisfied.  This provision
 26 11 takes effect upon enactment and applies retroactively to July
 26 12 1, 2014, for all workforce housing tax incentive agreements
 26 13 entered into on or after that date.
 26 14    The division allows the EDA to extend the project
 26 15 completion date for a project awarded tax incentives under the
 26 16 redevelopment tax credit program and the housing enterprise
 26 17 zone tax incentives program if the property that is the subject
 26 18 of the project suffered a catastrophic fire during the 2014
 26 19 calendar year.
       LSB 1212HV (3) 86
       mm/sc
 18 28 meet several requirements.  First, the business must be
 18 29 physically located in Iowa and operated for profit under
 18 30 single management.  Second, the business must not be an
 18 31 entity providing professional services, health care services,
 18 32 or medical treatments, or be engaged primarily in retail
 18 33 operations.  Third, the business must have organized, expanded,
 18 34 or located in Iowa on or after the effective date of the
 18 35 division.  Fourth, the business must not be, in the discretion
 19  1 of the EDA, ineligible under certain provisions relating to the
 19  2 relocation or reduction of business operations within Iowa.
 19  3 Fifth, the business must be in compliance with all agreements
 19  4 entered into under the program or other programs administered
 19  5 by the EDA.
 19  6    An eligible business seeking a tax credit is required
 19  7 to apply to the EDA during the calendar year following the
 19  8 calendar year in which the renewable chemicals are produced.
 19  9 The application must include the amount of renewable chemicals
 19 10 produced in Iowa from biomass feedstock by the eligible
 19 11 business during the calendar year, measured in pounds, and any
 19 12 other information reasonably required by the EDA in order to
 19 13 establish and verify eligibility under the program.  The EDA
 19 14 may accept applications on a continuous basis or may establish
 19 15 an annual application deadline.
 19 16    Before being issued a tax credit, an eligible business
 19 17 is required to enter into an agreement with the EDA for the
 19 18 successful completion of all requirements of the program.  The
 19 19 EDA is authorized to impose two compliance cost fees under the
 19 20 program.  The first fee equals $500 per agreement.  The second
 19 21 fee equals 0.5 percent of the value of the tax credit claimed
 19 22 pursuant to the agreement if the agreement has an aggregate tax
 19 23 credit value of $100,000 or greater.
 19 24    An eligible business that fails to comply with the
 19 25 requirements of the program or the terms of an agreement with
 19 26 the EDA may have its tax credits reduced, terminated, or
 19 27 rescinded, and may be subject to the repayment or recapture of
 19 28 claimed tax credits.
 19 29    Upon determining that all requirements of an agreement and
 19 30 the program have been fulfilled, the EDA shall issue a tax
 19 31 credit and related tax credit certificate to the eligible
 19 32 business in an amount equal to the product of $.05 multiplied
 19 33 by the number of pounds of renewable chemicals produced in Iowa
 19 34 from biomass feedstock by the eligible business during the
 19 35 calendar year.  Renewable chemicals produced by an eligible
 20  1 business prior to the effective date of the division, or
 20  2 prior to the date the business first qualifies as an eligible
 20  3 business, or after calendar year 2025, shall not qualify for
 20  4 the tax credit.
 20  5    The tax credit shall be claimed for the tax year during
 20  6 which the eligible business was issued the tax credit.  The tax
 20  7 credit may be claimed against the individual income tax and the
 20  8 corporate income tax.  The credit is refundable or may, at the
 20  9 election of the taxpayer, be carried forward for up to one tax
 20 10 year.   The tax credit shall not be transferred to any person.  A
 20 11 tax credit issued to a partnership, limited liability company,
 20 12 S corporation, cooperative organized under Code chapter 501
 20 13 and filing as a partnership for federal tax purposes, estate,
 20 14 or trust electing to have the income taxed directly to the
 20 15 individual may be claimed by the individual based upon the pro
 20 16 rata share of the individual's earnings from that entity.
 20 17    The division provides that the program is subject to the
 20 18 EDA's maximum aggregate tax credit cap of $170 million per
 20 19 fiscal year in Code section 15.119, and not more than $15
 20 20 million per fiscal year may be issued by the EDA under the
 20 21 program.  In addition, the maximum amount of tax credit that
 20 22 may be issued to an eligible business in any one calendar year
 20 23 shall not exceed $1 million or $500,000, depending on whether
 20 24 the eligible business has been operating in Iowa at the time of
 20 25 application for five or fewer years, or more than five years,
 20 26 respectively.  An eligible business shall not receive more than
 20 27 five tax credits under the program.  The EDA is required to
 20 28 issue tax credits on a first=come, first=served basis until the
 20 29 maximum amount of $15 million per fiscal year is reached.  If
 20 30 the amount of tax credits exceeds this amount in a fiscal year,
 20 31 the EDA is required to establish a wait list and give priority
 20 32 in subsequent years to the eligible businesses on the wait
 20 33 list.
 20 34    The division provides for the confidentiality of certain
 20 35 information under the program.  The identity of a tax credit
 21  1 recipient and the amount of the tax credit shall be considered
 21  2 public information under Code chapter 22 (examination of public
 21  3 records), but any other information or record in the possession
 21  4 of the EDA with respect to the program shall be presumed by
 21  5 the EDA to be a trade secret protected under Code chapter 550
 21  6 or common law and shall be kept confidential by the EDA unless
 21  7 otherwise ordered by a court.
 21  8    The division takes effect upon enactment and applies to
 21  9 renewable chemicals produced in Iowa from biomass feedstock on
 21 10 or after that date.  The division applies retroactively to tax
 21 11 years beginning on or after January 1, 2015.
 21 12    DIVISION II ==== ANGEL INVESTOR TAX CREDITS.   Division II
 21 13 makes several changes to the tax credit for investments in
 21 14 qualifying businesses and community=based seed capital funds,
 21 15 often referred to as the angel investor tax credits.  The
 21 16 division amends the purpose of the tax credit in Code section
 21 17 15E.41.  The division excludes investments in community=based
 21 18 seed capital funds from qualifying for the tax credit and
 21 19 makes several conforming amendments to remove references to
 21 20 community=based seed capital funds from the Code.
 21 21    The division modifies the amount and dollar limitation of
 21 22 the tax credit for a taxpayer.  The tax credit is increased
 21 23 from 20 percent to 25 percent of a taxpayer's equity investment
 21 24 in a qualifying business.  Under current law, a taxpayer cannot
 21 25 claim more than $50,000 of tax credit per investment in a
 21 26 qualifying business, and for each tax year a taxpayer and the
 21 27 taxpayer's affiliates cannot claim tax credits for more than
 21 28 five investments in five different qualifying businesses.  The
 21 29 division amends this dollar limitation to prohibit a natural
 21 30 person and the person's spouse, child, or sibling from claiming
 21 31 a combined amount of more than $100,000 in tax credits per tax
 21 32 year.
 21 33    The division also provides that no more than $500,000 in tax
 21 34 credits may be issued per tax year for equity investments in
 21 35 any one qualifying business.
 22  1 The division modifies the procedures for claiming the tax
 22  2 credit.  Under current law, the tax credit is not refundable
 22  3 but available for carryforward for up to five tax years.  The
 22  4 division makes the tax credit refundable for an investment
 22  5 made by a natural person, and for any other person reduces the
 22  6 carryforward period to three years.
 22  7    The division strikes a provision permitting the EDA
 22  8 to cooperate with small business development centers to
 22  9 disseminate information regarding the credits and to develop
 22 10 standard application forms, and requiring the EDA to distribute
 22 11 copies of the application forms to all community=based seed
 22 12 capital funds and potential individual investors.
 22 13    The division modifies the eligibility requirements for
 22 14 qualifying businesses.  The division strikes the requirement
 22 15 that a business have an owner that meets at least one of
 22 16 four qualifications relating to business education or
 22 17 business experience.  The division requires that a business
 22 18 be participating in an entrepreneurial assistance program,
 22 19 as defined in the division, but allows the EDA to waive this
 22 20 requirement if the business establishes that its owners,
 22 21 directors, officers, and employees have an appropriate level
 22 22 of experience such that an entrepreneurial assistance program
 22 23 would not materially change the prospects of the business.
 22 24 The EDA is allowed to consult with outside service providers
 22 25 in considering such a waiver.  The division increases from $5
 22 26 million to $10 million the maximum amount of net worth that
 22 27 a business may have to be considered a qualifying business.
 22 28 The division increases from $250,000 to $500,000 the amount of
 22 29 financing that a business must have in order to be considered a
 22 30 qualifying business, removes "near equity" from the types of
 22 31 financing that will be considered in that calculation, requires
 22 32 that the financing be secured at the time of application for
 22 33 the tax credits, and requires that the business have at least
 22 34 two investors at the time of application for the tax credits.
 22 35 These modified eligibility requirements apply to businesses
 23  1 that submit an application to the EDA to be registered as a
 23  2 qualifying business on or after the effective date of this
 23  3 division of the bill, and businesses that submitted such an
 23  4 application to the EDA before the effective date of this
 23  5 division of the bill shall be governed by current law.
 23  6    The division provides for the confidentiality of certain
 23  7 information with regard to the tax credit.  The identity of
 23  8 a qualifying business, the identity of an investor and the
 23  9 qualifying business in which the investor made an equity
 23 10 investment, and the total number and amount of tax credits
 23 11 issued shall be considered public information under Code
 23 12 chapter 22 (examination of public records), but any other
 23 13 information or record in the possession of the EDA with respect
 23 14 to the program shall be presumed by the EDA to be a trade secret
 23 15 protected under Code chapter 550 or common law and shall be
 23 16 kept confidential by the EDA unless otherwise ordered by a
 23 17 court.
 23 18    The division takes effect upon enactment and applies to
 23 19 equity investments in a qualifying business made on or after
 23 20 that date.  Equity investments in a qualifying business or
 23 21 community=based seed capital fund made prior to the effective
 23 22 date of the division shall be governed by current law.
 23 23    DIVISION III ==== ENTREPRENEUR INVESTMENT AWARDS PROGRAM.
 23 24  Division III amends the entrepreneur investment awards program
 23 25 administered by the EDA.  The division strikes provisions that
 23 26 prohibited the EDA from making awards under the program since
 23 27 July 1, 2014, and that required the EDA by December 31, 2014,
 23 28 to conduct a comprehensive review of the program and submit
 23 29 a report with specified information to the governor and the
 23 30 general assembly.
 23 31    The division modifies the purpose of the program to be
 23 32 to provide financial assistance to eligible entrepreneurial
 23 33 assistance providers (provider) that provide technical and
 23 34 financial assistance to entrepreneurs and start=up companies
 23 35 seeking to create, locate, or expand a business in Iowa.
 24  1 "Financial assistance" is defined in the division.
 24  2    The division changes the requirements for receiving an
 24  3 award.  To be eligible to receive an award under current
 24  4 law, an entrepreneurial assistance program must have been
 24  5 an Iowa=based business, expended at least $500,000 during
 24  6 the previous fiscal year to provide technical and financial
 24  7 assistance services that meet the broad=based needs of
 24  8 entrepreneurs seeking to create, locate, or expand a business
 24  9 in Iowa that intends to derive more than 10 percent of its
 24 10 gross sales from markets outside Iowa; and must have engaged
 24 11 and communicated with certain other programs, funding sources,
 24 12 and entities for its entrepreneur clients.  The division
 24 13 amends the eligibility for receiving financial assistance to
 24 14 require that a provider have its principal place of operations
 24 15 in Iowa and that the provider offer a comprehensive set of
 24 16 business development services to emerging and early=stage
 24 17 innovation companies to assist in the creation, location,
 24 18 growth, and long=term success of the company in Iowa.
 24 19 "Business development services" is defined in the division.
 24 20 Business development services may be performed at the physical
 24 21 location of the provider or the company and may be provided in
 24 22 consideration of equity participation in the company, a fee for
 24 23 services, or a membership agreement with the company.
 24 24    Under current law, the EDA board could approve, deny, or
 24 25 defer each application for a grant, and was required to award
 24 26 grants on a first=come, first=served basis.  The division
 24 27 specifies that the EDA board has the discretion to approve,
 24 28 deny, or defer each application for financial assistance and
 24 29 that the amount of financial assistance awarded to a provider
 24 30 is within the discretion of the EDA.  The division requires
 24 31 the EDA to award financial assistance on a competitive basis
 24 32 and allows the EDA to develop scoring criteria and establish
 24 33 minimum requirements for the receipt of a financial assistance
 24 34 award.
 24 35    In addition to the four factors relating to the provider's
 25  1 professional staff that the EDA may consider under current
 25  2 law in deciding whether to award financial assistance, the
 25  3 division provides that the EDA may also consider the service
 25  4 model and likelihood of success of the provider, the provider's
 25  5 similarity to other successful providers in the country, and
 25  6 the provider's financial need.
 25  7    The division modifies the maximum award amount for a
 25  8 recipient.  Under current law, a grant to an entrepreneur
 25  9 assistance program cannot exceed the lesser of 25 percent of
 25 10 the funds expended by the program during the previous fiscal
 25 11 year, 100 percent of the funds raised from certain persons
 25 12 by the program during the previous fiscal year, or $200,000.
 25 13 The division provides that the amount of financial assistance
 25 14 awarded to any one provider shall not exceed $200,000.
 25 15    The division modifies the permitted use of funds received
 25 16 under the program.  Under current law, grants are only
 25 17 permitted to be used for the purpose of operating costs
 25 18 incurred by the program.  The division specifies that financial
 25 19 assistance awarded to a provider shall only be used for
 25 20 the purpose of operating costs incurred by the provider in
 25 21 the provision of business development services to emerging
 25 22 and early=stage innovation companies in Iowa.  The division
 25 23 further requires that such financial assistance shall not be
 25 24 distributed to owners or investors of the company to which the
 25 25 business development services are being provided and shall not
 25 26 be provided to other persons assisting with the provision of
 25 27 the services.
 25 28    Under current law, an entrepreneurial assistance provider is
 25 29 required to accept client referrals from the EDA as a condition
 25 30 of receiving a grant.  The division provides that the EDA may
 25 31 make client referrals to eligible providers.
 25 32    DIVISION IV ==== MISCELLANEOUS CHANGES.  Division IV makes
 25 33 several miscellaneous changes to other EDA programs.  The
 25 34 division amends the sales and use tax refund available under
 25 35 the workforce housing tax incentive program.  That refund
 26  1 is available for sales and use tax paid prior to project
 26  2 completion, which is currently defined to mean the first date
 26  3 upon which the average annualized production of finished
 26  4 product for the preceding 90=day period at the manufacturing
 26  5 facility operated by the eligible business is at least 50
 26  6 percent of the initial design capacity of the facility.  The
 26  7 division amends the definition of "project completion" to mean
 26  8 the date on which the EDA notifies the department of revenue
 26  9 that all applicable requirements of a workforce housing tax
 26 10 incentive program agreement are satisfied.  This provision
 26 11 takes effect upon enactment and applies retroactively to July
 26 12 1, 2014, for all workforce housing tax incentive agreements
 26 13 entered into on or after that date.
 26 14    The division allows the EDA to extend the project
 26 15 completion date for a project awarded tax incentives under the
 26 16 redevelopment tax credit program and the housing enterprise
 26 17 zone tax incentives program if the property that is the subject
 26 18 of the project suffered a catastrophic fire during the 2014
 26 19 calendar year.

 18 29 physically located in Iowa and operated for profit under
 18 30 single management.  Second, the business must not be an
 18 31 entity providing professional services, health care services,
 18 32 or medical treatments, or be engaged primarily in retail
 18 33 operations.  Third, the business must have organized, expanded,
 18 34 or located in Iowa on or after the effective date of the
 18 35 division.  Fourth, the business must not be, in the discretion
 19  1 of the EDA, ineligible under certain provisions relating to the
 19  2 relocation or reduction of business operations within Iowa.
 19  3 Fifth, the business must be in compliance with all agreements
 19  4 entered into under the program or other programs administered
 19  5 by the EDA.
 19  6    An eligible business seeking a tax credit is required
 19  7 to apply to the EDA during the calendar year following the
 19  8 calendar year in which the renewable chemicals are produced.
 19  9 The application must include the amount of renewable chemicals
 19 10 produced in Iowa from biomass feedstock by the eligible
 19 11 business during the calendar year, measured in pounds, and any
 19 12 other information reasonably required by the EDA in order to
 19 13 establish and verify eligibility under the program.  The EDA
 19 14 may accept applications on a continuous basis or may establish
 19 15 an annual application deadline.
 19 16    Before being issued a tax credit, an eligible business
 19 17 is required to enter into an agreement with the EDA for the
 19 18 successful completion of all requirements of the program.  The
 19 19 EDA is authorized to impose two compliance cost fees under the
 19 20 program.  The first fee equals $500 per agreement.  The second
 19 21 fee equals 0.5 percent of the value of the tax credit claimed
 19 22 pursuant to the agreement if the agreement has an aggregate tax
 19 23 credit value of $100,000 or greater.
 19 24    An eligible business that fails to comply with the
 19 25 requirements of the program or the terms of an agreement with
 19 26 the EDA may have its tax credits reduced, terminated, or
 19 27 rescinded, and may be subject to the repayment or recapture of
 19 28 claimed tax credits.
 19 29    Upon determining that all requirements of an agreement and
 19 30 the program have been fulfilled, the EDA shall issue a tax
 19 31 credit and related tax credit certificate to the eligible
 19 32 business in an amount equal to the product of $.05 multiplied
 19 33 by the number of pounds of renewable chemicals produced in Iowa
 19 34 from biomass feedstock by the eligible business during the
 19 35 calendar year.  Renewable chemicals produced by an eligible
 20  1 business prior to the effective date of the division, or
 20  2 prior to the date the business first qualifies as an eligible
 20  3 business, or after calendar year 2025, shall not qualify for
 20  4 the tax credit.
 20  5    The tax credit shall be claimed for the tax year during
 20  6 which the eligible business was issued the tax credit.  The tax
 20  7 credit may be claimed against the individual income tax and the
 20  8 corporate income tax.  The credit is refundable or may, at the
 20  9 election of the taxpayer, be carried forward for up to one tax
 20 10 year.   The tax credit shall not be transferred to any person.  A
 20 11 tax credit issued to a partnership, limited liability company,
 20 12 S corporation, cooperative organized under Code chapter 501
 20 13 and filing as a partnership for federal tax purposes, estate,
 20 14 or trust electing to have the income taxed directly to the
 20 15 individual may be claimed by the individual based upon the pro
 20 16 rata share of the individual's earnings from that entity.
 20 17    The division provides that the program is subject to the
 20 18 EDA's maximum aggregate tax credit cap of $170 million per
 20 19 fiscal year in Code section 15.119, and not more than $15
 20 20 million per fiscal year may be issued by the EDA under the
 20 21 program.  In addition, the maximum amount of tax credit that
 20 22 may be issued to an eligible business in any one calendar year
 20 23 shall not exceed $1 million or $500,000, depending on whether
 20 24 the eligible business has been operating in Iowa at the time of
 20 25 application for five or fewer years, or more than five years,
 20 26 respectively.  An eligible business shall not receive more than
 20 27 five tax credits under the program.  The EDA is required to
 20 28 issue tax credits on a first=come, first=served basis until the
 20 29 maximum amount of $15 million per fiscal year is reached.  If
 20 30 the amount of tax credits exceeds this amount in a fiscal year,
 20 31 the EDA is required to establish a wait list and give priority
 20 32 in subsequent years to the eligible businesses on the wait
 20 33 list.
 20 34    The division provides for the confidentiality of certain
 20 35 information under the program.  The identity of a tax credit
 21  1 recipient and the amount of the tax credit shall be considered
 21  2 public information under Code chapter 22 (examination of public
 21  3 records), but any other information or record in the possession
 21  4 of the EDA with respect to the program shall be presumed by
 21  5 the EDA to be a trade secret protected under Code chapter 550
 21  6 or common law and shall be kept confidential by the EDA unless
 21  7 otherwise ordered by a court.
 21  8    The division takes effect upon enactment and applies to
 21  9 renewable chemicals produced in Iowa from biomass feedstock on
 21 10 or after that date.  The division applies retroactively to tax
 21 11 years beginning on or after January 1, 2015.
 21 12    DIVISION II ==== ANGEL INVESTOR TAX CREDITS.   Division II
 21 13 makes several changes to the tax credit for investments in
 21 14 qualifying businesses and community=based seed capital funds,
 21 15 often referred to as the angel investor tax credits.  The
 21 16 division amends the purpose of the tax credit in Code section
 21 17 15E.41.  The division excludes investments in community=based
 21 18 seed capital funds from qualifying for the tax credit and
 21 19 makes several conforming amendments to remove references to
 21 20 community=based seed capital funds from the Code.
 21 21    The division modifies the amount and dollar limitation of
 21 22 the tax credit for a taxpayer.  The tax credit is increased
 21 23 from 20 percent to 25 percent of a taxpayer's equity investment
 21 24 in a qualifying business.  Under current law, a taxpayer cannot
 21 25 claim more than $50,000 of tax credit per investment in a
 21 26 qualifying business, and for each tax year a taxpayer and the
 21 27 taxpayer's affiliates cannot claim tax credits for more than
 21 28 five investments in five different qualifying businesses.  The
 21 29 division amends this dollar limitation to prohibit a natural
 21 30 person and the person's spouse, child, or sibling from claiming
 21 31 a combined amount of more than $100,000 in tax credits per tax
 21 32 year.
 21 33    The division also provides that no more than $500,000 in tax
 21 34 credits may be issued per tax year for equity investments in
 21 35 any one qualifying business.
 22  1 The division modifies the procedures for claiming the tax
 22  2 credit.  Under current law, the tax credit is not refundable
 22  3 but available for carryforward for up to five tax years.  The
 22  4 division makes the tax credit refundable for an investment
 22  5 made by a natural person, and for any other person reduces the
 22  6 carryforward period to three years.
 22  7    The division strikes a provision permitting the EDA
 22  8 to cooperate with small business development centers to
 22  9 disseminate information regarding the credits and to develop
 22 10 standard application forms, and requiring the EDA to distribute
 22 11 copies of the application forms to all community=based seed
 22 12 capital funds and potential individual investors.
 22 13    The division modifies the eligibility requirements for
 22 14 qualifying businesses.  The division strikes the requirement
 22 15 that a business have an owner that meets at least one of
 22 16 four qualifications relating to business education or
 22 17 business experience.  The division requires that a business
 22 18 be participating in an entrepreneurial assistance program,
 22 19 as defined in the division, but allows the EDA to waive this
 22 20 requirement if the business establishes that its owners,
 22 21 directors, officers, and employees have an appropriate level
 22 22 of experience such that an entrepreneurial assistance program
 22 23 would not materially change the prospects of the business.
 22 24 The EDA is allowed to consult with outside service providers
 22 25 in considering such a waiver.  The division increases from $5
 22 26 million to $10 million the maximum amount of net worth that
 22 27 a business may have to be considered a qualifying business.
 22 28 The division increases from $250,000 to $500,000 the amount of
 22 29 financing that a business must have in order to be considered a
 22 30 qualifying business, removes "near equity" from the types of
 22 31 financing that will be considered in that calculation, requires
 22 32 that the financing be secured at the time of application for
 22 33 the tax credits, and requires that the business have at least
 22 34 two investors at the time of application for the tax credits.
 22 35 These modified eligibility requirements apply to businesses
 23  1 that submit an application to the EDA to be registered as a
 23  2 qualifying business on or after the effective date of this
 23  3 division of the bill, and businesses that submitted such an
 23  4 application to the EDA before the effective date of this
 23  5 division of the bill shall be governed by current law.
 23  6    The division provides for the confidentiality of certain
 23  7 information with regard to the tax credit.  The identity of
 23  8 a qualifying business, the identity of an investor and the
 23  9 qualifying business in which the investor made an equity
 23 10 investment, and the total number and amount of tax credits
 23 11 issued shall be considered public information under Code
 23 12 chapter 22 (examination of public records), but any other
 23 13 information or record in the possession of the EDA with respect
 23 14 to the program shall be presumed by the EDA to be a trade secret
 23 15 protected under Code chapter 550 or common law and shall be
 23 16 kept confidential by the EDA unless otherwise ordered by a
 23 17 court.
 23 18    The division takes effect upon enactment and applies to
 23 19 equity investments in a qualifying business made on or after
 23 20 that date.  Equity investments in a qualifying business or
 23 21 community=based seed capital fund made prior to the effective
 23 22 date of the division shall be governed by current law.
 23 23    DIVISION III ==== ENTREPRENEUR INVESTMENT AWARDS PROGRAM.
 23 24  Division III amends the entrepreneur investment awards program
 23 25 administered by the EDA.  The division strikes provisions that
 23 26 prohibited the EDA from making awards under the program since
 23 27 July 1, 2014, and that required the EDA by December 31, 2014,
 23 28 to conduct a comprehensive review of the program and submit
 23 29 a report with specified information to the governor and the
 23 30 general assembly.
 23 31    The division modifies the purpose of the program to be
 23 32 to provide financial assistance to eligible entrepreneurial
 23 33 assistance providers (provider) that provide technical and
 23 34 financial assistance to entrepreneurs and start=up companies
 23 35 seeking to create, locate, or expand a business in Iowa.
 24  1 "Financial assistance" is defined in the division.
 24  2    The division changes the requirements for receiving an
 24  3 award.  To be eligible to receive an award under current
 24  4 law, an entrepreneurial assistance program must have been
 24  5 an Iowa=based business, expended at least $500,000 during
 24  6 the previous fiscal year to provide technical and financial
 24  7 assistance services that meet the broad=based needs of
 24  8 entrepreneurs seeking to create, locate, or expand a business
 24  9 in Iowa that intends to derive more than 10 percent of its
 24 10 gross sales from markets outside Iowa; and must have engaged
 24 11 and communicated with certain other programs, funding sources,
 24 12 and entities for its entrepreneur clients.  The division
 24 13 amends the eligibility for receiving financial assistance to
 24 14 require that a provider have its principal place of operations
 24 15 in Iowa and that the provider offer a comprehensive set of
 24 16 business development services to emerging and early=stage
 24 17 innovation companies to assist in the creation, location,
 24 18 growth, and long=term success of the company in Iowa.
 24 19 "Business development services" is defined in the division.
 24 20 Business development services may be performed at the physical
 24 21 location of the provider or the company and may be provided in
 24 22 consideration of equity participation in the company, a fee for
 24 23 services, or a membership agreement with the company.
 24 24    Under current law, the EDA board could approve, deny, or
 24 25 defer each application for a grant, and was required to award
 24 26 grants on a first=come, first=served basis.  The division
 24 27 specifies that the EDA board has the discretion to approve,
 24 28 deny, or defer each application for financial assistance and
 24 29 that the amount of financial assistance awarded to a provider
 24 30 is within the discretion of the EDA.  The division requires
 24 31 the EDA to award financial assistance on a competitive basis
 24 32 and allows the EDA to develop scoring criteria and establish
 24 33 minimum requirements for the receipt of a financial assistance
 24 34 award.
 24 35    In addition to the four factors relating to the provider's
 25  1 professional staff that the EDA may consider under current
 25  2 law in deciding whether to award financial assistance, the
 25  3 division provides that the EDA may also consider the service
 25  4 model and likelihood of success of the provider, the provider's
 25  5 similarity to other successful providers in the country, and
 25  6 the provider's financial need.
 25  7    The division modifies the maximum award amount for a
 25  8 recipient.  Under current law, a grant to an entrepreneur
 25  9 assistance program cannot exceed the lesser of 25 percent of
 25 10 the funds expended by the program during the previous fiscal
 25 11 year, 100 percent of the funds raised from certain persons
 25 12 by the program during the previous fiscal year, or $200,000.
 25 13 The division provides that the amount of financial assistance
 25 14 awarded to any one provider shall not exceed $200,000.
 25 15    The division modifies the permitted use of funds received
 25 16 under the program.  Under current law, grants are only
 25 17 permitted to be used for the purpose of operating costs
 25 18 incurred by the program.  The division specifies that financial
 25 19 assistance awarded to a provider shall only be used for
 25 20 the purpose of operating costs incurred by the provider in
 25 21 the provision of business development services to emerging
 25 22 and early=stage innovation companies in Iowa.  The division
 25 23 further requires that such financial assistance shall not be
 25 24 distributed to owners or investors of the company to which the
 25 25 business development services are being provided and shall not
 25 26 be provided to other persons assisting with the provision of
 25 27 the services.
 25 28    Under current law, an entrepreneurial assistance provider is
 25 29 required to accept client referrals from the EDA as a condition
 25 30 of receiving a grant.  The division provides that the EDA may
 25 31 make client referrals to eligible providers.
 25 32    DIVISION IV ==== MISCELLANEOUS CHANGES.  Division IV makes
 25 33 several miscellaneous changes to other EDA programs.  The
 25 34 division amends the sales and use tax refund available under
 25 35 the workforce housing tax incentive program.  That refund
 26  1 is available for sales and use tax paid prior to project
 26  2 completion, which is currently defined to mean the first date
 26  3 upon which the average annualized production of finished
 26  4 product for the preceding 90=day period at the manufacturing
 26  5 facility operated by the eligible business is at least 50
 26  6 percent of the initial design capacity of the facility.  The
 26  7 division amends the definition of "project completion" to mean
 26  8 the date on which the EDA notifies the department of revenue
 26  9 that all applicable requirements of a workforce housing tax
 26 10 incentive program agreement are satisfied.  This provision
 26 11 takes effect upon enactment and applies retroactively to July
 26 12 1, 2014, for all workforce housing tax incentive agreements
 26 13 entered into on or after that date.
 26 14    The division allows the EDA to extend the project
 26 15 completion date for a project awarded tax incentives under the
 26 16 redevelopment tax credit program and the housing enterprise
 26 17 zone tax incentives program if the property that is the subject
 26 18 of the project suffered a catastrophic fire during the 2014
 26 19 calendar year.

 18 35 division.  Fourth, the business must not be, in the discretion
 19  1 of the EDA, ineligible under certain provisions relating to the
 19  2 relocation or reduction of business operations within Iowa.
 19  3 Fifth, the business must be in compliance with all agreements
 19  4 entered into under the program or other programs administered
 19  5 by the EDA.
 19  6    An eligible business seeking a tax credit is required
 19  7 to apply to the EDA during the calendar year following the
 19  8 calendar year in which the renewable chemicals are produced.
 19  9 The application must include the amount of renewable chemicals
 19 10 produced in Iowa from biomass feedstock by the eligible
 19 11 business during the calendar year, measured in pounds, and any
 19 12 other information reasonably required by the EDA in order to
 19 13 establish and verify eligibility under the program.  The EDA
 19 14 may accept applications on a continuous basis or may establish
 19 15 an annual application deadline.
 19 16    Before being issued a tax credit, an eligible business
 19 17 is required to enter into an agreement with the EDA for the
 19 18 successful completion of all requirements of the program.  The
 19 19 EDA is authorized to impose two compliance cost fees under the
 19 20 program.  The first fee equals $500 per agreement.  The second
 19 21 fee equals 0.5 percent of the value of the tax credit claimed
 19 22 pursuant to the agreement if the agreement has an aggregate tax
 19 23 credit value of $100,000 or greater.
 19 24    An eligible business that fails to comply with the
 19 25 requirements of the program or the terms of an agreement with
 19 26 the EDA may have its tax credits reduced, terminated, or
 19 27 rescinded, and may be subject to the repayment or recapture of
 19 28 claimed tax credits.
 19 29    Upon determining that all requirements of an agreement and
 19 30 the program have been fulfilled, the EDA shall issue a tax
 19 31 credit and related tax credit certificate to the eligible
 19 32 business in an amount equal to the product of $.05 multiplied
 19 33 by the number of pounds of renewable chemicals produced in Iowa
 19 34 from biomass feedstock by the eligible business during the
 19 35 calendar year.  Renewable chemicals produced by an eligible
 20  1 business prior to the effective date of the division, or
 20  2 prior to the date the business first qualifies as an eligible
 20  3 business, or after calendar year 2025, shall not qualify for
 20  4 the tax credit.
 20  5    The tax credit shall be claimed for the tax year during
 20  6 which the eligible business was issued the tax credit.  The tax
 20  7 credit may be claimed against the individual income tax and the
 20  8 corporate income tax.  The credit is refundable or may, at the
 20  9 election of the taxpayer, be carried forward for up to one tax
 20 10 year.   The tax credit shall not be transferred to any person.  A
 20 11 tax credit issued to a partnership, limited liability company,
 20 12 S corporation, cooperative organized under Code chapter 501
 20 13 and filing as a partnership for federal tax purposes, estate,
 20 14 or trust electing to have the income taxed directly to the
 20 15 individual may be claimed by the individual based upon the pro
 20 16 rata share of the individual's earnings from that entity.
 20 17    The division provides that the program is subject to the
 20 18 EDA's maximum aggregate tax credit cap of $170 million per
 20 19 fiscal year in Code section 15.119, and not more than $15
 20 20 million per fiscal year may be issued by the EDA under the
 20 21 program.  In addition, the maximum amount of tax credit that
 20 22 may be issued to an eligible business in any one calendar year
 20 23 shall not exceed $1 million or $500,000, depending on whether
 20 24 the eligible business has been operating in Iowa at the time of
 20 25 application for five or fewer years, or more than five years,
 20 26 respectively.  An eligible business shall not receive more than
 20 27 five tax credits under the program.  The EDA is required to
 20 28 issue tax credits on a first=come, first=served basis until the
 20 29 maximum amount of $15 million per fiscal year is reached.  If
 20 30 the amount of tax credits exceeds this amount in a fiscal year,
 20 31 the EDA is required to establish a wait list and give priority
 20 32 in subsequent years to the eligible businesses on the wait
 20 33 list.
 20 34    The division provides for the confidentiality of certain
 20 35 information under the program.  The identity of a tax credit
 21  1 recipient and the amount of the tax credit shall be considered
 21  2 public information under Code chapter 22 (examination of public
 21  3 records), but any other information or record in the possession
 21  4 of the EDA with respect to the program shall be presumed by
 21  5 the EDA to be a trade secret protected under Code chapter 550
 21  6 or common law and shall be kept confidential by the EDA unless
 21  7 otherwise ordered by a court.
 21  8    The division takes effect upon enactment and applies to
 21  9 renewable chemicals produced in Iowa from biomass feedstock on
 21 10 or after that date.  The division applies retroactively to tax
 21 11 years beginning on or after January 1, 2015.
 21 12    DIVISION II ==== ANGEL INVESTOR TAX CREDITS.   Division II
 21 13 makes several changes to the tax credit for investments in
 21 14 qualifying businesses and community=based seed capital funds,
 21 15 often referred to as the angel investor tax credits.  The
 21 16 division amends the purpose of the tax credit in Code section
 21 17 15E.41.  The division excludes investments in community=based
 21 18 seed capital funds from qualifying for the tax credit and
 21 19 makes several conforming amendments to remove references to
 21 20 community=based seed capital funds from the Code.
 21 21    The division modifies the amount and dollar limitation of
 21 22 the tax credit for a taxpayer.  The tax credit is increased
 21 23 from 20 percent to 25 percent of a taxpayer's equity investment
 21 24 in a qualifying business.  Under current law, a taxpayer cannot
 21 25 claim more than $50,000 of tax credit per investment in a
 21 26 qualifying business, and for each tax year a taxpayer and the
 21 27 taxpayer's affiliates cannot claim tax credits for more than
 21 28 five investments in five different qualifying businesses.  The
 21 29 division amends this dollar limitation to prohibit a natural
 21 30 person and the person's spouse, child, or sibling from claiming
 21 31 a combined amount of more than $100,000 in tax credits per tax
 21 32 year.
 21 33    The division also provides that no more than $500,000 in tax
 21 34 credits may be issued per tax year for equity investments in
 21 35 any one qualifying business.
 22  1 The division modifies the procedures for claiming the tax
 22  2 credit.  Under current law, the tax credit is not refundable
 22  3 but available for carryforward for up to five tax years.  The
 22  4 division makes the tax credit refundable for an investment
 22  5 made by a natural person, and for any other person reduces the
 22  6 carryforward period to three years.
 22  7    The division strikes a provision permitting the EDA
 22  8 to cooperate with small business development centers to
 22  9 disseminate information regarding the credits and to develop
 22 10 standard application forms, and requiring the EDA to distribute
 22 11 copies of the application forms to all community=based seed
 22 12 capital funds and potential individual investors.
 22 13    The division modifies the eligibility requirements for
 22 14 qualifying businesses.  The division strikes the requirement
 22 15 that a business have an owner that meets at least one of
 22 16 four qualifications relating to business education or
 22 17 business experience.  The division requires that a business
 22 18 be participating in an entrepreneurial assistance program,
 22 19 as defined in the division, but allows the EDA to waive this
 22 20 requirement if the business establishes that its owners,
 22 21 directors, officers, and employees have an appropriate level
 22 22 of experience such that an entrepreneurial assistance program
 22 23 would not materially change the prospects of the business.
 22 24 The EDA is allowed to consult with outside service providers
 22 25 in considering such a waiver.  The division increases from $5
 22 26 million to $10 million the maximum amount of net worth that
 22 27 a business may have to be considered a qualifying business.
 22 28 The division increases from $250,000 to $500,000 the amount of
 22 29 financing that a business must have in order to be considered a
 22 30 qualifying business, removes "near equity" from the types of
 22 31 financing that will be considered in that calculation, requires
 22 32 that the financing be secured at the time of application for
 22 33 the tax credits, and requires that the business have at least
 22 34 two investors at the time of application for the tax credits.
 22 35 These modified eligibility requirements apply to businesses
 23  1 that submit an application to the EDA to be registered as a
 23  2 qualifying business on or after the effective date of this
 23  3 division of the bill, and businesses that submitted such an
 23  4 application to the EDA before the effective date of this
 23  5 division of the bill shall be governed by current law.
 23  6    The division provides for the confidentiality of certain
 23  7 information with regard to the tax credit.  The identity of
 23  8 a qualifying business, the identity of an investor and the
 23  9 qualifying business in which the investor made an equity
 23 10 investment, and the total number and amount of tax credits
 23 11 issued shall be considered public information under Code
 23 12 chapter 22 (examination of public records), but any other
 23 13 information or record in the possession of the EDA with respect
 23 14 to the program shall be presumed by the EDA to be a trade secret
 23 15 protected under Code chapter 550 or common law and shall be
 23 16 kept confidential by the EDA unless otherwise ordered by a
 23 17 court.
 23 18    The division takes effect upon enactment and applies to
 23 19 equity investments in a qualifying business made on or after
 23 20 that date.  Equity investments in a qualifying business or
 23 21 community=based seed capital fund made prior to the effective
 23 22 date of the division shall be governed by current law.
 23 23    DIVISION III ==== ENTREPRENEUR INVESTMENT AWARDS PROGRAM.
 23 24  Division III amends the entrepreneur investment awards program
 23 25 administered by the EDA.  The division strikes provisions that
 23 26 prohibited the EDA from making awards under the program since
 23 27 July 1, 2014, and that required the EDA by December 31, 2014,
 23 28 to conduct a comprehensive review of the program and submit
 23 29 a report with specified information to the governor and the
 23 30 general assembly.
 23 31    The division modifies the purpose of the program to be
 23 32 to provide financial assistance to eligible entrepreneurial
 23 33 assistance providers (provider) that provide technical and
 23 34 financial assistance to entrepreneurs and start=up companies
 23 35 seeking to create, locate, or expand a business in Iowa.
 24  1 "Financial assistance" is defined in the division.
 24  2    The division changes the requirements for receiving an
 24  3 award.  To be eligible to receive an award under current
 24  4 law, an entrepreneurial assistance program must have been
 24  5 an Iowa=based business, expended at least $500,000 during
 24  6 the previous fiscal year to provide technical and financial
 24  7 assistance services that meet the broad=based needs of
 24  8 entrepreneurs seeking to create, locate, or expand a business
 24  9 in Iowa that intends to derive more than 10 percent of its
 24 10 gross sales from markets outside Iowa; and must have engaged
 24 11 and communicated with certain other programs, funding sources,
 24 12 and entities for its entrepreneur clients.  The division
 24 13 amends the eligibility for receiving financial assistance to
 24 14 require that a provider have its principal place of operations
 24 15 in Iowa and that the provider offer a comprehensive set of
 24 16 business development services to emerging and early=stage
 24 17 innovation companies to assist in the creation, location,
 24 18 growth, and long=term success of the company in Iowa.
 24 19 "Business development services" is defined in the division.
 24 20 Business development services may be performed at the physical
 24 21 location of the provider or the company and may be provided in
 24 22 consideration of equity participation in the company, a fee for
 24 23 services, or a membership agreement with the company.
 24 24    Under current law, the EDA board could approve, deny, or
 24 25 defer each application for a grant, and was required to award
 24 26 grants on a first=come, first=served basis.  The division
 24 27 specifies that the EDA board has the discretion to approve,
 24 28 deny, or defer each application for financial assistance and
 24 29 that the amount of financial assistance awarded to a provider
 24 30 is within the discretion of the EDA.  The division requires
 24 31 the EDA to award financial assistance on a competitive basis
 24 32 and allows the EDA to develop scoring criteria and establish
 24 33 minimum requirements for the receipt of a financial assistance
 24 34 award.
 24 35    In addition to the four factors relating to the provider's
 25  1 professional staff that the EDA may consider under current
 25  2 law in deciding whether to award financial assistance, the
 25  3 division provides that the EDA may also consider the service
 25  4 model and likelihood of success of the provider, the provider's
 25  5 similarity to other successful providers in the country, and
 25  6 the provider's financial need.
 25  7    The division modifies the maximum award amount for a
 25  8 recipient.  Under current law, a grant to an entrepreneur
 25  9 assistance program cannot exceed the lesser of 25 percent of
 25 10 the funds expended by the program during the previous fiscal
 25 11 year, 100 percent of the funds raised from certain persons
 25 12 by the program during the previous fiscal year, or $200,000.
 25 13 The division provides that the amount of financial assistance
 25 14 awarded to any one provider shall not exceed $200,000.
 25 15    The division modifies the permitted use of funds received
 25 16 under the program.  Under current law, grants are only
 25 17 permitted to be used for the purpose of operating costs
 25 18 incurred by the program.  The division specifies that financial
 25 19 assistance awarded to a provider shall only be used for
 25 20 the purpose of operating costs incurred by the provider in
 25 21 the provision of business development services to emerging
 25 22 and early=stage innovation companies in Iowa.  The division
 25 23 further requires that such financial assistance shall not be
 25 24 distributed to owners or investors of the company to which the
 25 25 business development services are being provided and shall not
 25 26 be provided to other persons assisting with the provision of
 25 27 the services.
 25 28    Under current law, an entrepreneurial assistance provider is
 25 29 required to accept client referrals from the EDA as a condition
 25 30 of receiving a grant.  The division provides that the EDA may
 25 31 make client referrals to eligible providers.
 25 32    DIVISION IV ==== MISCELLANEOUS CHANGES.  Division IV makes
 25 33 several miscellaneous changes to other EDA programs.  The
 25 34 division amends the sales and use tax refund available under
 25 35 the workforce housing tax incentive program.  That refund
 26  1 is available for sales and use tax paid prior to project
 26  2 completion, which is currently defined to mean the first date
 26  3 upon which the average annualized production of finished
 26  4 product for the preceding 90=day period at the manufacturing
 26  5 facility operated by the eligible business is at least 50
 26  6 percent of the initial design capacity of the facility.  The
 26  7 division amends the definition of "project completion" to mean
 26  8 the date on which the EDA notifies the department of revenue
 26  9 that all applicable requirements of a workforce housing tax
 26 10 incentive program agreement are satisfied.  This provision
 26 11 takes effect upon enactment and applies retroactively to July
 26 12 1, 2014, for all workforce housing tax incentive agreements
 26 13 entered into on or after that date.
 26 14    The division allows the EDA to extend the project
 26 15 completion date for a project awarded tax incentives under the
 26 16 redevelopment tax credit program and the housing enterprise
 26 17 zone tax incentives program if the property that is the subject
 26 18 of the project suffered a catastrophic fire during the 2014
 26 19 calendar year.
       LSB 1212HV (3) 86
       mm/sc
 18 31 entity providing professional services, health care services,
 18 32 or medical treatments, or be engaged primarily in retail
 18 33 operations.  Third, the business must have organized, expanded,
 18 34 or located in Iowa on or after the effective date of the
 18 35 division.  Fourth, the business must not be, in the discretion
 19  1 of the EDA, ineligible under certain provisions relating to the
 19  2 relocation or reduction of business operations within Iowa.
 19  3 Fifth, the business must be in compliance with all agreements
 19  4 entered into under the program or other programs administered
 19  5 by the EDA.
 19  6    An eligible business seeking a tax credit is required
 19  7 to apply to the EDA during the calendar year following the
 19  8 calendar year in which the renewable chemicals are produced.
 19  9 The application must include the amount of renewable chemicals
 19 10 produced in Iowa from biomass feedstock by the eligible
 19 11 business during the calendar year, measured in pounds, and any
 19 12 other information reasonably required by the EDA in order to
 19 13 establish and verify eligibility under the program.  The EDA
 19 14 may accept applications on a continuous basis or may establish
 19 15 an annual application deadline.
 19 16    Before being issued a tax credit, an eligible business
 19 17 is required to enter into an agreement with the EDA for the
 19 18 successful completion of all requirements of the program.  The
 19 19 EDA is authorized to impose two compliance cost fees under the
 19 20 program.  The first fee equals $500 per agreement.  The second
 19 21 fee equals 0.5 percent of the value of the tax credit claimed
 19 22 pursuant to the agreement if the agreement has an aggregate tax
 19 23 credit value of $100,000 or greater.
 19 24    An eligible business that fails to comply with the
 19 25 requirements of the program or the terms of an agreement with
 19 26 the EDA may have its tax credits reduced, terminated, or
 19 27 rescinded, and may be subject to the repayment or recapture of
 19 28 claimed tax credits.
 19 29    Upon determining that all requirements of an agreement and
 19 30 the program have been fulfilled, the EDA shall issue a tax
 19 31 credit and related tax credit certificate to the eligible
 19 32 business in an amount equal to the product of $.05 multiplied
 19 33 by the number of pounds of renewable chemicals produced in Iowa
 19 34 from biomass feedstock by the eligible business during the
 19 35 calendar year.  Renewable chemicals produced by an eligible
 20  1 business prior to the effective date of the division, or
 20  2 prior to the date the business first qualifies as an eligible
 20  3 business, or after calendar year 2025, shall not qualify for
 20  4 the tax credit.
 20  5    The tax credit shall be claimed for the tax year during
 20  6 which the eligible business was issued the tax credit.  The tax
 20  7 credit may be claimed against the individual income tax and the
 20  8 corporate income tax.  The credit is refundable or may, at the
 20  9 election of the taxpayer, be carried forward for up to one tax
 20 10 year.   The tax credit shall not be transferred to any person.  A
 20 11 tax credit issued to a partnership, limited liability company,
 20 12 S corporation, cooperative organized under Code chapter 501
 20 13 and filing as a partnership for federal tax purposes, estate,
 20 14 or trust electing to have the income taxed directly to the
 20 15 individual may be claimed by the individual based upon the pro
 20 16 rata share of the individual's earnings from that entity.
 20 17    The division provides that the program is subject to the
 20 18 EDA's maximum aggregate tax credit cap of $170 million per
 20 19 fiscal year in Code section 15.119, and not more than $15
 20 20 million per fiscal year may be issued by the EDA under the
 20 21 program.  In addition, the maximum amount of tax credit that
 20 22 may be issued to an eligible business in any one calendar year
 20 23 shall not exceed $1 million or $500,000, depending on whether
 20 24 the eligible business has been operating in Iowa at the time of
 20 25 application for five or fewer years, or more than five years,
 20 26 respectively.  An eligible business shall not receive more than
 20 27 five tax credits under the program.  The EDA is required to
 20 28 issue tax credits on a first=come, first=served basis until the
 20 29 maximum amount of $15 million per fiscal year is reached.  If
 20 30 the amount of tax credits exceeds this amount in a fiscal year,
 20 31 the EDA is required to establish a wait list and give priority
 20 32 in subsequent years to the eligible businesses on the wait
 20 33 list.
 20 34    The division provides for the confidentiality of certain
 20 35 information under the program.  The identity of a tax credit
 21  1 recipient and the amount of the tax credit shall be considered
 21  2 public information under Code chapter 22 (examination of public
 21  3 records), but any other information or record in the possession
 21  4 of the EDA with respect to the program shall be presumed by
 21  5 the EDA to be a trade secret protected under Code chapter 550
 21  6 or common law and shall be kept confidential by the EDA unless
 21  7 otherwise ordered by a court.
 21  8    The division takes effect upon enactment and applies to
 21  9 renewable chemicals produced in Iowa from biomass feedstock on
 21 10 or after that date.  The division applies retroactively to tax
 21 11 years beginning on or after January 1, 2015.
 21 12    DIVISION II ==== ANGEL INVESTOR TAX CREDITS.   Division II
 21 13 makes several changes to the tax credit for investments in
 21 14 qualifying businesses and community=based seed capital funds,
 21 15 often referred to as the angel investor tax credits.  The
 21 16 division amends the purpose of the tax credit in Code section
 21 17 15E.41.  The division excludes investments in community=based
 21 18 seed capital funds from qualifying for the tax credit and
 21 19 makes several conforming amendments to remove references to
 21 20 community=based seed capital funds from the Code.
 21 21    The division modifies the amount and dollar limitation of
 21 22 the tax credit for a taxpayer.  The tax credit is increased
 21 23 from 20 percent to 25 percent of a taxpayer's equity investment
 21 24 in a qualifying business.  Under current law, a taxpayer cannot
 21 25 claim more than $50,000 of tax credit per investment in a
 21 26 qualifying business, and for each tax year a taxpayer and the
 21 27 taxpayer's affiliates cannot claim tax credits for more than
 21 28 five investments in five different qualifying businesses.  The
 21 29 division amends this dollar limitation to prohibit a natural
 21 30 person and the person's spouse, child, or sibling from claiming
 21 31 a combined amount of more than $100,000 in tax credits per tax
 21 32 year.
 21 33    The division also provides that no more than $500,000 in tax
 21 34 credits may be issued per tax year for equity investments in
 21 35 any one qualifying business.
 22  1 The division modifies the procedures for claiming the tax
 22  2 credit.  Under current law, the tax credit is not refundable
 22  3 but available for carryforward for up to five tax years.  The
 22  4 division makes the tax credit refundable for an investment
 22  5 made by a natural person, and for any other person reduces the
 22  6 carryforward period to three years.
 22  7    The division strikes a provision permitting the EDA
 22  8 to cooperate with small business development centers to
 22  9 disseminate information regarding the credits and to develop
 22 10 standard application forms, and requiring the EDA to distribute
 22 11 copies of the application forms to all community=based seed
 22 12 capital funds and potential individual investors.
 22 13    The division modifies the eligibility requirements for
 22 14 qualifying businesses.  The division strikes the requirement
 22 15 that a business have an owner that meets at least one of
 22 16 four qualifications relating to business education or
 22 17 business experience.  The division requires that a business
 22 18 be participating in an entrepreneurial assistance program,
 22 19 as defined in the division, but allows the EDA to waive this
 22 20 requirement if the business establishes that its owners,
 22 21 directors, officers, and employees have an appropriate level
 22 22 of experience such that an entrepreneurial assistance program
 22 23 would not materially change the prospects of the business.
 22 24 The EDA is allowed to consult with outside service providers
 22 25 in considering such a waiver.  The division increases from $5
 22 26 million to $10 million the maximum amount of net worth that
 22 27 a business may have to be considered a qualifying business.
 22 28 The division increases from $250,000 to $500,000 the amount of
 22 29 financing that a business must have in order to be considered a
 22 30 qualifying business, removes "near equity" from the types of
 22 31 financing that will be considered in that calculation, requires
 22 32 that the financing be secured at the time of application for
 22 33 the tax credits, and requires that the business have at least
 22 34 two investors at the time of application for the tax credits.
 22 35 These modified eligibility requirements apply to businesses
 23  1 that submit an application to the EDA to be registered as a
 23  2 qualifying business on or after the effective date of this
 23  3 division of the bill, and businesses that submitted such an
 23  4 application to the EDA before the effective date of this
 23  5 division of the bill shall be governed by current law.
 23  6    The division provides for the confidentiality of certain
 23  7 information with regard to the tax credit.  The identity of
 23  8 a qualifying business, the identity of an investor and the
 23  9 qualifying business in which the investor made an equity
 23 10 investment, and the total number and amount of tax credits
 23 11 issued shall be considered public information under Code
 23 12 chapter 22 (examination of public records), but any other
 23 13 information or record in the possession of the EDA with respect
 23 14 to the program shall be presumed by the EDA to be a trade secret
 23 15 protected under Code chapter 550 or common law and shall be
 23 16 kept confidential by the EDA unless otherwise ordered by a
 23 17 court.
 23 18    The division takes effect upon enactment and applies to
 23 19 equity investments in a qualifying business made on or after
 23 20 that date.  Equity investments in a qualifying business or
 23 21 community=based seed capital fund made prior to the effective
 23 22 date of the division shall be governed by current law.
 23 23    DIVISION III ==== ENTREPRENEUR INVESTMENT AWARDS PROGRAM.
 23 24  Division III amends the entrepreneur investment awards program
 23 25 administered by the EDA.  The division strikes provisions that
 23 26 prohibited the EDA from making awards under the program since
 23 27 July 1, 2014, and that required the EDA by December 31, 2014,
 23 28 to conduct a comprehensive review of the program and submit
 23 29 a report with specified information to the governor and the
 23 30 general assembly.
 23 31    The division modifies the purpose of the program to be
 23 32 to provide financial assistance to eligible entrepreneurial
 23 33 assistance providers (provider) that provide technical and
 23 34 financial assistance to entrepreneurs and start=up companies
 23 35 seeking to create, locate, or expand a business in Iowa.
 24  1 "Financial assistance" is defined in the division.
 24  2    The division changes the requirements for receiving an
 24  3 award.  To be eligible to receive an award under current
 24  4 law, an entrepreneurial assistance program must have been
 24  5 an Iowa=based business, expended at least $500,000 during
 24  6 the previous fiscal year to provide technical and financial
 24  7 assistance services that meet the broad=based needs of
 24  8 entrepreneurs seeking to create, locate, or expand a business
 24  9 in Iowa that intends to derive more than 10 percent of its
 24 10 gross sales from markets outside Iowa; and must have engaged
 24 11 and communicated with certain other programs, funding sources,
 24 12 and entities for its entrepreneur clients.  The division
 24 13 amends the eligibility for receiving financial assistance to
 24 14 require that a provider have its principal place of operations
 24 15 in Iowa and that the provider offer a comprehensive set of
 24 16 business development services to emerging and early=stage
 24 17 innovation companies to assist in the creation, location,
 24 18 growth, and long=term success of the company in Iowa.
 24 19 "Business development services" is defined in the division.
 24 20 Business development services may be performed at the physical
 24 21 location of the provider or the company and may be provided in
 24 22 consideration of equity participation in the company, a fee for
 24 23 services, or a membership agreement with the company.
 24 24    Under current law, the EDA board could approve, deny, or
 24 25 defer each application for a grant, and was required to award
 24 26 grants on a first=come, first=served basis.  The division
 24 27 specifies that the EDA board has the discretion to approve,
 24 28 deny, or defer each application for financial assistance and
 24 29 that the amount of financial assistance awarded to a provider
 24 30 is within the discretion of the EDA.  The division requires
 24 31 the EDA to award financial assistance on a competitive basis
 24 32 and allows the EDA to develop scoring criteria and establish
 24 33 minimum requirements for the receipt of a financial assistance
 24 34 award.
 24 35    In addition to the four factors relating to the provider's
 25  1 professional staff that the EDA may consider under current
 25  2 law in deciding whether to award financial assistance, the
 25  3 division provides that the EDA may also consider the service
 25  4 model and likelihood of success of the provider, the provider's
 25  5 similarity to other successful providers in the country, and
 25  6 the provider's financial need.
 25  7    The division modifies the maximum award amount for a
 25  8 recipient.  Under current law, a grant to an entrepreneur
 25  9 assistance program cannot exceed the lesser of 25 percent of
 25 10 the funds expended by the program during the previous fiscal
 25 11 year, 100 percent of the funds raised from certain persons
 25 12 by the program during the previous fiscal year, or $200,000.
 25 13 The division provides that the amount of financial assistance
 25 14 awarded to any one provider shall not exceed $200,000.
 25 15    The division modifies the permitted use of funds received
 25 16 under the program.  Under current law, grants are only
 25 17 permitted to be used for the purpose of operating costs
 25 18 incurred by the program.  The division specifies that financial
 25 19 assistance awarded to a provider shall only be used for
 25 20 the purpose of operating costs incurred by the provider in
 25 21 the provision of business development services to emerging
 25 22 and early=stage innovation companies in Iowa.  The division
 25 23 further requires that such financial assistance shall not be
 25 24 distributed to owners or investors of the company to which the
 25 25 business development services are being provided and shall not
 25 26 be provided to other persons assisting with the provision of
 25 27 the services.
 25 28    Under current law, an entrepreneurial assistance provider is
 25 29 required to accept client referrals from the EDA as a condition
 25 30 of receiving a grant.  The division provides that the EDA may
 25 31 make client referrals to eligible providers.
 25 32    DIVISION IV ==== MISCELLANEOUS CHANGES.  Division IV makes
 25 33 several miscellaneous changes to other EDA programs.  The
 25 34 division amends the sales and use tax refund available under
 25 35 the workforce housing tax incentive program.  That refund
 26  1 is available for sales and use tax paid prior to project
 26  2 completion, which is currently defined to mean the first date
 26  3 upon which the average annualized production of finished
 26  4 product for the preceding 90=day period at the manufacturing
 26  5 facility operated by the eligible business is at least 50
 26  6 percent of the initial design capacity of the facility.  The
 26  7 division amends the definition of "project completion" to mean
 26  8 the date on which the EDA notifies the department of revenue
 26  9 that all applicable requirements of a workforce housing tax
 26 10 incentive program agreement are satisfied.  This provision
 26 11 takes effect upon enactment and applies retroactively to July
 26 12 1, 2014, for all workforce housing tax incentive agreements
 26 13 entered into on or after that date.
 26 14    The division allows the EDA to extend the project
 26 15 completion date for a project awarded tax incentives under the
 26 16 redevelopment tax credit program and the housing enterprise
 26 17 zone tax incentives program if the property that is the subject
 26 18 of the project suffered a catastrophic fire during the 2014
 26 19 calendar year.

 18 32 or medical treatments, or be engaged primarily in retail
 18 33 operations.  Third, the business must have organized, expanded,
 18 34 or located in Iowa on or after the effective date of the
 18 35 division.  Fourth, the business must not be, in the discretion
 19  1 of the EDA, ineligible under certain provisions relating to the
 19  2 relocation or reduction of business operations within Iowa.
 19  3 Fifth, the business must be in compliance with all agreements
 19  4 entered into under the program or other programs administered
 19  5 by the EDA.
 19  6    An eligible business seeking a tax credit is required
 19  7 to apply to the EDA during the calendar year following the
 19  8 calendar year in which the renewable chemicals are produced.
 19  9 The application must include the amount of renewable chemicals
 19 10 produced in Iowa from biomass feedstock by the eligible
 19 11 business during the calendar year, measured in pounds, and any
 19 12 other information reasonably required by the EDA in order to
 19 13 establish and verify eligibility under the program.  The EDA
 19 14 may accept applications on a continuous basis or may establish
 19 15 an annual application deadline.
 19 16    Before being issued a tax credit, an eligible business
 19 17 is required to enter into an agreement with the EDA for the
 19 18 successful completion of all requirements of the program.  The
 19 19 EDA is authorized to impose two compliance cost fees under the
 19 20 program.  The first fee equals $500 per agreement.  The second
 19 21 fee equals 0.5 percent of the value of the tax credit claimed
 19 22 pursuant to the agreement if the agreement has an aggregate tax
 19 23 credit value of $100,000 or greater.
 19 24    An eligible business that fails to comply with the
 19 25 requirements of the program or the terms of an agreement with
 19 26 the EDA may have its tax credits reduced, terminated, or
 19 27 rescinded, and may be subject to the repayment or recapture of
 19 28 claimed tax credits.
 19 29    Upon determining that all requirements of an agreement and
 19 30 the program have been fulfilled, the EDA shall issue a tax
 19 31 credit and related tax credit certificate to the eligible
 19 32 business in an amount equal to the product of $.05 multiplied
 19 33 by the number of pounds of renewable chemicals produced in Iowa
 19 34 from biomass feedstock by the eligible business during the
 19 35 calendar year.  Renewable chemicals produced by an eligible
 20  1 business prior to the effective date of the division, or
 20  2 prior to the date the business first qualifies as an eligible
 20  3 business, or after calendar year 2025, shall not qualify for
 20  4 the tax credit.
 20  5    The tax credit shall be claimed for the tax year during
 20  6 which the eligible business was issued the tax credit.  The tax
 20  7 credit may be claimed against the individual income tax and the
 20  8 corporate income tax.  The credit is refundable or may, at the
 20  9 election of the taxpayer, be carried forward for up to one tax
 20 10 year.   The tax credit shall not be transferred to any person.  A
 20 11 tax credit issued to a partnership, limited liability company,
 20 12 S corporation, cooperative organized under Code chapter 501
 20 13 and filing as a partnership for federal tax purposes, estate,
 20 14 or trust electing to have the income taxed directly to the
 20 15 individual may be claimed by the individual based upon the pro
 20 16 rata share of the individual's earnings from that entity.
 20 17    The division provides that the program is subject to the
 20 18 EDA's maximum aggregate tax credit cap of $170 million per
 20 19 fiscal year in Code section 15.119, and not more than $15
 20 20 million per fiscal year may be issued by the EDA under the
 20 21 program.  In addition, the maximum amount of tax credit that
 20 22 may be issued to an eligible business in any one calendar year
 20 23 shall not exceed $1 million or $500,000, depending on whether
 20 24 the eligible business has been operating in Iowa at the time of
 20 25 application for five or fewer years, or more than five years,
 20 26 respectively.  An eligible business shall not receive more than
 20 27 five tax credits under the program.  The EDA is required to
 20 28 issue tax credits on a first=come, first=served basis until the
 20 29 maximum amount of $15 million per fiscal year is reached.  If
 20 30 the amount of tax credits exceeds this amount in a fiscal year,
 20 31 the EDA is required to establish a wait list and give priority
 20 32 in subsequent years to the eligible businesses on the wait
 20 33 list.
 20 34    The division provides for the confidentiality of certain
 20 35 information under the program.  The identity of a tax credit
 21  1 recipient and the amount of the tax credit shall be considered
 21  2 public information under Code chapter 22 (examination of public
 21  3 records), but any other information or record in the possession
 21  4 of the EDA with respect to the program shall be presumed by
 21  5 the EDA to be a trade secret protected under Code chapter 550
 21  6 or common law and shall be kept confidential by the EDA unless
 21  7 otherwise ordered by a court.
 21  8    The division takes effect upon enactment and applies to
 21  9 renewable chemicals produced in Iowa from biomass feedstock on
 21 10 or after that date.  The division applies retroactively to tax
 21 11 years beginning on or after January 1, 2015.
 21 12    DIVISION II ==== ANGEL INVESTOR TAX CREDITS.   Division II
 21 13 makes several changes to the tax credit for investments in
 21 14 qualifying businesses and community=based seed capital funds,
 21 15 often referred to as the angel investor tax credits.  The
 21 16 division amends the purpose of the tax credit in Code section
 21 17 15E.41.  The division excludes investments in community=based
 21 18 seed capital funds from qualifying for the tax credit and
 21 19 makes several conforming amendments to remove references to
 21 20 community=based seed capital funds from the Code.
 21 21    The division modifies the amount and dollar limitation of
 21 22 the tax credit for a taxpayer.  The tax credit is increased
 21 23 from 20 percent to 25 percent of a taxpayer's equity investment
 21 24 in a qualifying business.  Under current law, a taxpayer cannot
 21 25 claim more than $50,000 of tax credit per investment in a
 21 26 qualifying business, and for each tax year a taxpayer and the
 21 27 taxpayer's affiliates cannot claim tax credits for more than
 21 28 five investments in five different qualifying businesses.  The
 21 29 division amends this dollar limitation to prohibit a natural
 21 30 person and the person's spouse, child, or sibling from claiming
 21 31 a combined amount of more than $100,000 in tax credits per tax
 21 32 year.
 21 33    The division also provides that no more than $500,000 in tax
 21 34 credits may be issued per tax year for equity investments in
 21 35 any one qualifying business.
 22  1 The division modifies the procedures for claiming the tax
 22  2 credit.  Under current law, the tax credit is not refundable
 22  3 but available for carryforward for up to five tax years.  The
 22  4 division makes the tax credit refundable for an investment
 22  5 made by a natural person, and for any other person reduces the
 22  6 carryforward period to three years.
 22  7    The division strikes a provision permitting the EDA
 22  8 to cooperate with small business development centers to
 22  9 disseminate information regarding the credits and to develop
 22 10 standard application forms, and requiring the EDA to distribute
 22 11 copies of the application forms to all community=based seed
 22 12 capital funds and potential individual investors.
 22 13    The division modifies the eligibility requirements for
 22 14 qualifying businesses.  The division strikes the requirement
 22 15 that a business have an owner that meets at least one of
 22 16 four qualifications relating to business education or
 22 17 business experience.  The division requires that a business
 22 18 be participating in an entrepreneurial assistance program,
 22 19 as defined in the division, but allows the EDA to waive this
 22 20 requirement if the business establishes that its owners,
 22 21 directors, officers, and employees have an appropriate level
 22 22 of experience such that an entrepreneurial assistance program
 22 23 would not materially change the prospects of the business.
 22 24 The EDA is allowed to consult with outside service providers
 22 25 in considering such a waiver.  The division increases from $5
 22 26 million to $10 million the maximum amount of net worth that
 22 27 a business may have to be considered a qualifying business.
 22 28 The division increases from $250,000 to $500,000 the amount of
 22 29 financing that a business must have in order to be considered a
 22 30 qualifying business, removes "near equity" from the types of
 22 31 financing that will be considered in that calculation, requires
 22 32 that the financing be secured at the time of application for
 22 33 the tax credits, and requires that the business have at least
 22 34 two investors at the time of application for the tax credits.
 22 35 These modified eligibility requirements apply to businesses
 23  1 that submit an application to the EDA to be registered as a
 23  2 qualifying business on or after the effective date of this
 23  3 division of the bill, and businesses that submitted such an
 23  4 application to the EDA before the effective date of this
 23  5 division of the bill shall be governed by current law.
 23  6    The division provides for the confidentiality of certain
 23  7 information with regard to the tax credit.  The identity of
 23  8 a qualifying business, the identity of an investor and the
 23  9 qualifying business in which the investor made an equity
 23 10 investment, and the total number and amount of tax credits
 23 11 issued shall be considered public information under Code
 23 12 chapter 22 (examination of public records), but any other
 23 13 information or record in the possession of the EDA with respect
 23 14 to the program shall be presumed by the EDA to be a trade secret
 23 15 protected under Code chapter 550 or common law and shall be
 23 16 kept confidential by the EDA unless otherwise ordered by a
 23 17 court.
 23 18    The division takes effect upon enactment and applies to
 23 19 equity investments in a qualifying business made on or after
 23 20 that date.  Equity investments in a qualifying business or
 23 21 community=based seed capital fund made prior to the effective
 23 22 date of the division shall be governed by current law.
 23 23    DIVISION III ==== ENTREPRENEUR INVESTMENT AWARDS PROGRAM.
 23 24  Division III amends the entrepreneur investment awards program
 23 25 administered by the EDA.  The division strikes provisions that
 23 26 prohibited the EDA from making awards under the program since
 23 27 July 1, 2014, and that required the EDA by December 31, 2014,
 23 28 to conduct a comprehensive review of the program and submit
 23 29 a report with specified information to the governor and the
 23 30 general assembly.
 23 31    The division modifies the purpose of the program to be
 23 32 to provide financial assistance to eligible entrepreneurial
 23 33 assistance providers (provider) that provide technical and
 23 34 financial assistance to entrepreneurs and start=up companies
 23 35 seeking to create, locate, or expand a business in Iowa.
 24  1 "Financial assistance" is defined in the division.
 24  2    The division changes the requirements for receiving an
 24  3 award.  To be eligible to receive an award under current
 24  4 law, an entrepreneurial assistance program must have been
 24  5 an Iowa=based business, expended at least $500,000 during
 24  6 the previous fiscal year to provide technical and financial
 24  7 assistance services that meet the broad=based needs of
 24  8 entrepreneurs seeking to create, locate, or expand a business
 24  9 in Iowa that intends to derive more than 10 percent of its
 24 10 gross sales from markets outside Iowa; and must have engaged
 24 11 and communicated with certain other programs, funding sources,
 24 12 and entities for its entrepreneur clients.  The division
 24 13 amends the eligibility for receiving financial assistance to
 24 14 require that a provider have its principal place of operations
 24 15 in Iowa and that the provider offer a comprehensive set of
 24 16 business development services to emerging and early=stage
 24 17 innovation companies to assist in the creation, location,
 24 18 growth, and long=term success of the company in Iowa.
 24 19 "Business development services" is defined in the division.
 24 20 Business development services may be performed at the physical
 24 21 location of the provider or the company and may be provided in
 24 22 consideration of equity participation in the company, a fee for
 24 23 services, or a membership agreement with the company.
 24 24    Under current law, the EDA board could approve, deny, or
 24 25 defer each application for a grant, and was required to award
 24 26 grants on a first=come, first=served basis.  The division
 24 27 specifies that the EDA board has the discretion to approve,
 24 28 deny, or defer each application for financial assistance and
 24 29 that the amount of financial assistance awarded to a provider
 24 30 is within the discretion of the EDA.  The division requires
 24 31 the EDA to award financial assistance on a competitive basis
 24 32 and allows the EDA to develop scoring criteria and establish
 24 33 minimum requirements for the receipt of a financial assistance
 24 34 award.
 24 35    In addition to the four factors relating to the provider's
 25  1 professional staff that the EDA may consider under current
 25  2 law in deciding whether to award financial assistance, the
 25  3 division provides that the EDA may also consider the service
 25  4 model and likelihood of success of the provider, the provider's
 25  5 similarity to other successful providers in the country, and
 25  6 the provider's financial need.
 25  7    The division modifies the maximum award amount for a
 25  8 recipient.  Under current law, a grant to an entrepreneur
 25  9 assistance program cannot exceed the lesser of 25 percent of
 25 10 the funds expended by the program during the previous fiscal
 25 11 year, 100 percent of the funds raised from certain persons
 25 12 by the program during the previous fiscal year, or $200,000.
 25 13 The division provides that the amount of financial assistance
 25 14 awarded to any one provider shall not exceed $200,000.
 25 15    The division modifies the permitted use of funds received
 25 16 under the program.  Under current law, grants are only
 25 17 permitted to be used for the purpose of operating costs
 25 18 incurred by the program.  The division specifies that financial
 25 19 assistance awarded to a provider shall only be used for
 25 20 the purpose of operating costs incurred by the provider in
 25 21 the provision of business development services to emerging
 25 22 and early=stage innovation companies in Iowa.  The division
 25 23 further requires that such financial assistance shall not be
 25 24 distributed to owners or investors of the company to which the
 25 25 business development services are being provided and shall not
 25 26 be provided to other persons assisting with the provision of
 25 27 the services.
 25 28    Under current law, an entrepreneurial assistance provider is
 25 29 required to accept client referrals from the EDA as a condition
 25 30 of receiving a grant.  The division provides that the EDA may
 25 31 make client referrals to eligible providers.
 25 32    DIVISION IV ==== MISCELLANEOUS CHANGES.  Division IV makes
 25 33 several miscellaneous changes to other EDA programs.  The
 25 34 division amends the sales and use tax refund available under
 25 35 the workforce housing tax incentive program.  That refund
 26  1 is available for sales and use tax paid prior to project
 26  2 completion, which is currently defined to mean the first date
 26  3 upon which the average annualized production of finished
 26  4 product for the preceding 90=day period at the manufacturing
 26  5 facility operated by the eligible business is at least 50
 26  6 percent of the initial design capacity of the facility.  The
 26  7 division amends the definition of "project completion" to mean
 26  8 the date on which the EDA notifies the department of revenue
 26  9 that all applicable requirements of a workforce housing tax
 26 10 incentive program agreement are satisfied.  This provision
 26 11 takes effect upon enactment and applies retroactively to July
 26 12 1, 2014, for all workforce housing tax incentive agreements
 26 13 entered into on or after that date.
 26 14    The division allows the EDA to extend the project
 26 15 completion date for a project awarded tax incentives under the
 26 16 redevelopment tax credit program and the housing enterprise
 26 17 zone tax incentives program if the property that is the subject
 26 18 of the project suffered a catastrophic fire during the 2014
 26 19 calendar year.
       LSB 1212HV (3) 86
       mm/sc
 18 33 operations.  Third, the business must have organized, expanded,
 18 34 or located in Iowa on or after the effective date of the
 18 35 division.  Fourth, the business must not be, in the discretion
 19  1 of the EDA, ineligible under certain provisions relating to the
 19  2 relocation or reduction of business operations within Iowa.
 19  3 Fifth, the business must be in compliance with all agreements
 19  4 entered into under the program or other programs administered
 19  5 by the EDA.
 19  6    An eligible business seeking a tax credit is required
 19  7 to apply to the EDA during the calendar year following the
 19  8 calendar year in which the renewable chemicals are produced.
 19  9 The application must include the amount of renewable chemicals
 19 10 produced in Iowa from biomass feedstock by the eligible
 19 11 business during the calendar year, measured in pounds, and any
 19 12 other information reasonably required by the EDA in order to
 19 13 establish and verify eligibility under the program.  The EDA
 19 14 may accept applications on a continuous basis or may establish
 19 15 an annual application deadline.
 19 16    Before being issued a tax credit, an eligible business
 19 17 is required to enter into an agreement with the EDA for the
 19 18 successful completion of all requirements of the program.  The
 19 19 EDA is authorized to impose two compliance cost fees under the
 19 20 program.  The first fee equals $500 per agreement.  The second
 19 21 fee equals 0.5 percent of the value of the tax credit claimed
 19 22 pursuant to the agreement if the agreement has an aggregate tax
 19 23 credit value of $100,000 or greater.
 19 24    An eligible business that fails to comply with the
 19 25 requirements of the program or the terms of an agreement with
 19 26 the EDA may have its tax credits reduced, terminated, or
 19 27 rescinded, and may be subject to the repayment or recapture of
 19 28 claimed tax credits.
 19 29    Upon determining that all requirements of an agreement and
 19 30 the program have been fulfilled, the EDA shall issue a tax
 19 31 credit and related tax credit certificate to the eligible
 19 32 business in an amount equal to the product of $.05 multiplied
 19 33 by the number of pounds of renewable chemicals produced in Iowa
 19 34 from biomass feedstock by the eligible business during the
 19 35 calendar year.  Renewable chemicals produced by an eligible
 20  1 business prior to the effective date of the division, or
 20  2 prior to the date the business first qualifies as an eligible
 20  3 business, or after calendar year 2025, shall not qualify for
 20  4 the tax credit.
 20  5    The tax credit shall be claimed for the tax year during
 20  6 which the eligible business was issued the tax credit.  The tax
 20  7 credit may be claimed against the individual income tax and the
 20  8 corporate income tax.  The credit is refundable or may, at the
 20  9 election of the taxpayer, be carried forward for up to one tax
 20 10 year.   The tax credit shall not be transferred to any person.  A
 20 11 tax credit issued to a partnership, limited liability company,
 20 12 S corporation, cooperative organized under Code chapter 501
 20 13 and filing as a partnership for federal tax purposes, estate,
 20 14 or trust electing to have the income taxed directly to the
 20 15 individual may be claimed by the individual based upon the pro
 20 16 rata share of the individual's earnings from that entity.
 20 17    The division provides that the program is subject to the
 20 18 EDA's maximum aggregate tax credit cap of $170 million per
 20 19 fiscal year in Code section 15.119, and not more than $15
 20 20 million per fiscal year may be issued by the EDA under the
 20 21 program.  In addition, the maximum amount of tax credit that
 20 22 may be issued to an eligible business in any one calendar year
 20 23 shall not exceed $1 million or $500,000, depending on whether
 20 24 the eligible business has been operating in Iowa at the time of
 20 25 application for five or fewer years, or more than five years,
 20 26 respectively.  An eligible business shall not receive more than
 20 27 five tax credits under the program.  The EDA is required to
 20 28 issue tax credits on a first=come, first=served basis until the
 20 29 maximum amount of $15 million per fiscal year is reached.  If
 20 30 the amount of tax credits exceeds this amount in a fiscal year,
 20 31 the EDA is required to establish a wait list and give priority
 20 32 in subsequent years to the eligible businesses on the wait
 20 33 list.
 20 34    The division provides for the confidentiality of certain
 20 35 information under the program.  The identity of a tax credit
 21  1 recipient and the amount of the tax credit shall be considered
 21  2 public information under Code chapter 22 (examination of public
 21  3 records), but any other information or record in the possession
 21  4 of the EDA with respect to the program shall be presumed by
 21  5 the EDA to be a trade secret protected under Code chapter 550
 21  6 or common law and shall be kept confidential by the EDA unless
 21  7 otherwise ordered by a court.
 21  8    The division takes effect upon enactment and applies to
 21  9 renewable chemicals produced in Iowa from biomass feedstock on
 21 10 or after that date.  The division applies retroactively to tax
 21 11 years beginning on or after January 1, 2015.
 21 12    DIVISION II ==== ANGEL INVESTOR TAX CREDITS.   Division II
 21 13 makes several changes to the tax credit for investments in
 21 14 qualifying businesses and community=based seed capital funds,
 21 15 often referred to as the angel investor tax credits.  The
 21 16 division amends the purpose of the tax credit in Code section
 21 17 15E.41.  The division excludes investments in community=based
 21 18 seed capital funds from qualifying for the tax credit and
 21 19 makes several conforming amendments to remove references to
 21 20 community=based seed capital funds from the Code.
 21 21    The division modifies the amount and dollar limitation of
 21 22 the tax credit for a taxpayer.  The tax credit is increased
 21 23 from 20 percent to 25 percent of a taxpayer's equity investment
 21 24 in a qualifying business.  Under current law, a taxpayer cannot
 21 25 claim more than $50,000 of tax credit per investment in a
 21 26 qualifying business, and for each tax year a taxpayer and the
 21 27 taxpayer's affiliates cannot claim tax credits for more than
 21 28 five investments in five different qualifying businesses.  The
 21 29 division amends this dollar limitation to prohibit a natural
 21 30 person and the person's spouse, child, or sibling from claiming
 21 31 a combined amount of more than $100,000 in tax credits per tax
 21 32 year.
 21 33    The division also provides that no more than $500,000 in tax
 21 34 credits may be issued per tax year for equity investments in
 21 35 any one qualifying business.
 22  1 The division modifies the procedures for claiming the tax
 22  2 credit.  Under current law, the tax credit is not refundable
 22  3 but available for carryforward for up to five tax years.  The
 22  4 division makes the tax credit refundable for an investment
 22  5 made by a natural person, and for any other person reduces the
 22  6 carryforward period to three years.
 22  7    The division strikes a provision permitting the EDA
 22  8 to cooperate with small business development centers to
 22  9 disseminate information regarding the credits and to develop
 22 10 standard application forms, and requiring the EDA to distribute
 22 11 copies of the application forms to all community=based seed
 22 12 capital funds and potential individual investors.
 22 13    The division modifies the eligibility requirements for
 22 14 qualifying businesses.  The division strikes the requirement
 22 15 that a business have an owner that meets at least one of
 22 16 four qualifications relating to business education or
 22 17 business experience.  The division requires that a business
 22 18 be participating in an entrepreneurial assistance program,
 22 19 as defined in the division, but allows the EDA to waive this
 22 20 requirement if the business establishes that its owners,
 22 21 directors, officers, and employees have an appropriate level
 22 22 of experience such that an entrepreneurial assistance program
 22 23 would not materially change the prospects of the business.
 22 24 The EDA is allowed to consult with outside service providers
 22 25 in considering such a waiver.  The division increases from $5
 22 26 million to $10 million the maximum amount of net worth that
 22 27 a business may have to be considered a qualifying business.
 22 28 The division increases from $250,000 to $500,000 the amount of
 22 29 financing that a business must have in order to be considered a
 22 30 qualifying business, removes "near equity" from the types of
 22 31 financing that will be considered in that calculation, requires
 22 32 that the financing be secured at the time of application for
 22 33 the tax credits, and requires that the business have at least
 22 34 two investors at the time of application for the tax credits.
 22 35 These modified eligibility requirements apply to businesses
 23  1 that submit an application to the EDA to be registered as a
 23  2 qualifying business on or after the effective date of this
 23  3 division of the bill, and businesses that submitted such an
 23  4 application to the EDA before the effective date of this
 23  5 division of the bill shall be governed by current law.
 23  6    The division provides for the confidentiality of certain
 23  7 information with regard to the tax credit.  The identity of
 23  8 a qualifying business, the identity of an investor and the
 23  9 qualifying business in which the investor made an equity
 23 10 investment, and the total number and amount of tax credits
 23 11 issued shall be considered public information under Code
 23 12 chapter 22 (examination of public records), but any other
 23 13 information or record in the possession of the EDA with respect
 23 14 to the program shall be presumed by the EDA to be a trade secret
 23 15 protected under Code chapter 550 or common law and shall be
 23 16 kept confidential by the EDA unless otherwise ordered by a
 23 17 court.
 23 18    The division takes effect upon enactment and applies to
 23 19 equity investments in a qualifying business made on or after
 23 20 that date.  Equity investments in a qualifying business or
 23 21 community=based seed capital fund made prior to the effective
 23 22 date of the division shall be governed by current law.
 23 23    DIVISION III ==== ENTREPRENEUR INVESTMENT AWARDS PROGRAM.
 23 24  Division III amends the entrepreneur investment awards program
 23 25 administered by the EDA.  The division strikes provisions that
 23 26 prohibited the EDA from making awards under the program since
 23 27 July 1, 2014, and that required the EDA by December 31, 2014,
 23 28 to conduct a comprehensive review of the program and submit
 23 29 a report with specified information to the governor and the
 23 30 general assembly.
 23 31    The division modifies the purpose of the program to be
 23 32 to provide financial assistance to eligible entrepreneurial
 23 33 assistance providers (provider) that provide technical and
 23 34 financial assistance to entrepreneurs and start=up companies
 23 35 seeking to create, locate, or expand a business in Iowa.
 24  1 "Financial assistance" is defined in the division.
 24  2    The division changes the requirements for receiving an
 24  3 award.  To be eligible to receive an award under current
 24  4 law, an entrepreneurial assistance program must have been
 24  5 an Iowa=based business, expended at least $500,000 during
 24  6 the previous fiscal year to provide technical and financial
 24  7 assistance services that meet the broad=based needs of
 24  8 entrepreneurs seeking to create, locate, or expand a business
 24  9 in Iowa that intends to derive more than 10 percent of its
 24 10 gross sales from markets outside Iowa; and must have engaged
 24 11 and communicated with certain other programs, funding sources,
 24 12 and entities for its entrepreneur clients.  The division
 24 13 amends the eligibility for receiving financial assistance to
 24 14 require that a provider have its principal place of operations
 24 15 in Iowa and that the provider offer a comprehensive set of
 24 16 business development services to emerging and early=stage
 24 17 innovation companies to assist in the creation, location,
 24 18 growth, and long=term success of the company in Iowa.
 24 19 "Business development services" is defined in the division.
 24 20 Business development services may be performed at the physical
 24 21 location of the provider or the company and may be provided in
 24 22 consideration of equity participation in the company, a fee for
 24 23 services, or a membership agreement with the company.
 24 24    Under current law, the EDA board could approve, deny, or
 24 25 defer each application for a grant, and was required to award
 24 26 grants on a first=come, first=served basis.  The division
 24 27 specifies that the EDA board has the discretion to approve,
 24 28 deny, or defer each application for financial assistance and
 24 29 that the amount of financial assistance awarded to a provider
 24 30 is within the discretion of the EDA.  The division requires
 24 31 the EDA to award financial assistance on a competitive basis
 24 32 and allows the EDA to develop scoring criteria and establish
 24 33 minimum requirements for the receipt of a financial assistance
 24 34 award.
 24 35    In addition to the four factors relating to the provider's
 25  1 professional staff that the EDA may consider under current
 25  2 law in deciding whether to award financial assistance, the
 25  3 division provides that the EDA may also consider the service
 25  4 model and likelihood of success of the provider, the provider's
 25  5 similarity to other successful providers in the country, and
 25  6 the provider's financial need.
 25  7    The division modifies the maximum award amount for a
 25  8 recipient.  Under current law, a grant to an entrepreneur
 25  9 assistance program cannot exceed the lesser of 25 percent of
 25 10 the funds expended by the program during the previous fiscal
 25 11 year, 100 percent of the funds raised from certain persons
 25 12 by the program during the previous fiscal year, or $200,000.
 25 13 The division provides that the amount of financial assistance
 25 14 awarded to any one provider shall not exceed $200,000.
 25 15    The division modifies the permitted use of funds received
 25 16 under the program.  Under current law, grants are only
 25 17 permitted to be used for the purpose of operating costs
 25 18 incurred by the program.  The division specifies that financial
 25 19 assistance awarded to a provider shall only be used for
 25 20 the purpose of operating costs incurred by the provider in
 25 21 the provision of business development services to emerging
 25 22 and early=stage innovation companies in Iowa.  The division
 25 23 further requires that such financial assistance shall not be
 25 24 distributed to owners or investors of the company to which the
 25 25 business development services are being provided and shall not
 25 26 be provided to other persons assisting with the provision of
 25 27 the services.
 25 28    Under current law, an entrepreneurial assistance provider is
 25 29 required to accept client referrals from the EDA as a condition
 25 30 of receiving a grant.  The division provides that the EDA may
 25 31 make client referrals to eligible providers.
 25 32    DIVISION IV ==== MISCELLANEOUS CHANGES.  Division IV makes
 25 33 several miscellaneous changes to other EDA programs.  The
 25 34 division amends the sales and use tax refund available under
 25 35 the workforce housing tax incentive program.  That refund
 26  1 is available for sales and use tax paid prior to project
 26  2 completion, which is currently defined to mean the first date
 26  3 upon which the average annualized production of finished
 26  4 product for the preceding 90=day period at the manufacturing
 26  5 facility operated by the eligible business is at least 50
 26  6 percent of the initial design capacity of the facility.  The
 26  7 division amends the definition of "project completion" to mean
 26  8 the date on which the EDA notifies the department of revenue
 26  9 that all applicable requirements of a workforce housing tax
 26 10 incentive program agreement are satisfied.  This provision
 26 11 takes effect upon enactment and applies retroactively to July
 26 12 1, 2014, for all workforce housing tax incentive agreements
 26 13 entered into on or after that date.
 26 14    The division allows the EDA to extend the project
 26 15 completion date for a project awarded tax incentives under the
 26 16 redevelopment tax credit program and the housing enterprise
 26 17 zone tax incentives program if the property that is the subject
 26 18 of the project suffered a catastrophic fire during the 2014
 26 19 calendar year.
       LSB 1212HV (3) 86
       mm/sc
 18 34 or located in Iowa on or after the effective date of the
 18 35 division.  Fourth, the business must not be, in the discretion
 19  1 of the EDA, ineligible under certain provisions relating to the
 19  2 relocation or reduction of business operations within Iowa.
 19  3 Fifth, the business must be in compliance with all agreements
 19  4 entered into under the program or other programs administered
 19  5 by the EDA.
 19  6    An eligible business seeking a tax credit is required
 19  7 to apply to the EDA during the calendar year following the
 19  8 calendar year in which the renewable chemicals are produced.
 19  9 The application must include the amount of renewable chemicals
 19 10 produced in Iowa from biomass feedstock by the eligible
 19 11 business during the calendar year, measured in pounds, and any
 19 12 other information reasonably required by the EDA in order to
 19 13 establish and verify eligibility under the program.  The EDA
 19 14 may accept applications on a continuous basis or may establish
 19 15 an annual application deadline.
 19 16    Before being issued a tax credit, an eligible business
 19 17 is required to enter into an agreement with the EDA for the
 19 18 successful completion of all requirements of the program.  The
 19 19 EDA is authorized to impose two compliance cost fees under the
 19 20 program.  The first fee equals $500 per agreement.  The second
 19 21 fee equals 0.5 percent of the value of the tax credit claimed
 19 22 pursuant to the agreement if the agreement has an aggregate tax
 19 23 credit value of $100,000 or greater.
 19 24    An eligible business that fails to comply with the
 19 25 requirements of the program or the terms of an agreement with
 19 26 the EDA may have its tax credits reduced, terminated, or
 19 27 rescinded, and may be subject to the repayment or recapture of
 19 28 claimed tax credits.
 19 29    Upon determining that all requirements of an agreement and
 19 30 the program have been fulfilled, the EDA shall issue a tax
 19 31 credit and related tax credit certificate to the eligible
 19 32 business in an amount equal to the product of $.05 multiplied
 19 33 by the number of pounds of renewable chemicals produced in Iowa
 19 34 from biomass feedstock by the eligible business during the
 19 35 calendar year.  Renewable chemicals produced by an eligible
 20  1 business prior to the effective date of the division, or
 20  2 prior to the date the business first qualifies as an eligible
 20  3 business, or after calendar year 2025, shall not qualify for
 20  4 the tax credit.
 20  5    The tax credit shall be claimed for the tax year during
 20  6 which the eligible business was issued the tax credit.  The tax
 20  7 credit may be claimed against the individual income tax and the
 20  8 corporate income tax.  The credit is refundable or may, at the
 20  9 election of the taxpayer, be carried forward for up to one tax
 20 10 year.   The tax credit shall not be transferred to any person.  A
 20 11 tax credit issued to a partnership, limited liability company,
 20 12 S corporation, cooperative organized under Code chapter 501
 20 13 and filing as a partnership for federal tax purposes, estate,
 20 14 or trust electing to have the income taxed directly to the
 20 15 individual may be claimed by the individual based upon the pro
 20 16 rata share of the individual's earnings from that entity.
 20 17    The division provides that the program is subject to the
 20 18 EDA's maximum aggregate tax credit cap of $170 million per
 20 19 fiscal year in Code section 15.119, and not more than $15
 20 20 million per fiscal year may be issued by the EDA under the
 20 21 program.  In addition, the maximum amount of tax credit that
 20 22 may be issued to an eligible business in any one calendar year
 20 23 shall not exceed $1 million or $500,000, depending on whether
 20 24 the eligible business has been operating in Iowa at the time of
 20 25 application for five or fewer years, or more than five years,
 20 26 respectively.  An eligible business shall not receive more than
 20 27 five tax credits under the program.  The EDA is required to
 20 28 issue tax credits on a first=come, first=served basis until the
 20 29 maximum amount of $15 million per fiscal year is reached.  If
 20 30 the amount of tax credits exceeds this amount in a fiscal year,
 20 31 the EDA is required to establish a wait list and give priority
 20 32 in subsequent years to the eligible businesses on the wait
 20 33 list.
 20 34    The division provides for the confidentiality of certain
 20 35 information under the program.  The identity of a tax credit
 21  1 recipient and the amount of the tax credit shall be considered
 21  2 public information under Code chapter 22 (examination of public
 21  3 records), but any other information or record in the possession
 21  4 of the EDA with respect to the program shall be presumed by
 21  5 the EDA to be a trade secret protected under Code chapter 550
 21  6 or common law and shall be kept confidential by the EDA unless
 21  7 otherwise ordered by a court.
 21  8    The division takes effect upon enactment and applies to
 21  9 renewable chemicals produced in Iowa from biomass feedstock on
 21 10 or after that date.  The division applies retroactively to tax
 21 11 years beginning on or after January 1, 2015.
 21 12    DIVISION II ==== ANGEL INVESTOR TAX CREDITS.   Division II
 21 13 makes several changes to the tax credit for investments in
 21 14 qualifying businesses and community=based seed capital funds,
 21 15 often referred to as the angel investor tax credits.  The
 21 16 division amends the purpose of the tax credit in Code section
 21 17 15E.41.  The division excludes investments in community=based
 21 18 seed capital funds from qualifying for the tax credit and
 21 19 makes several conforming amendments to remove references to
 21 20 community=based seed capital funds from the Code.
 21 21    The division modifies the amount and dollar limitation of
 21 22 the tax credit for a taxpayer.  The tax credit is increased
 21 23 from 20 percent to 25 percent of a taxpayer's equity investment
 21 24 in a qualifying business.  Under current law, a taxpayer cannot
 21 25 claim more than $50,000 of tax credit per investment in a
 21 26 qualifying business, and for each tax year a taxpayer and the
 21 27 taxpayer's affiliates cannot claim tax credits for more than
 21 28 five investments in five different qualifying businesses.  The
 21 29 division amends this dollar limitation to prohibit a natural
 21 30 person and the person's spouse, child, or sibling from claiming
 21 31 a combined amount of more than $100,000 in tax credits per tax
 21 32 year.
 21 33    The division also provides that no more than $500,000 in tax
 21 34 credits may be issued per tax year for equity investments in
 21 35 any one qualifying business.
 22  1 The division modifies the procedures for claiming the tax
 22  2 credit.  Under current law, the tax credit is not refundable
 22  3 but available for carryforward for up to five tax years.  The
 22  4 division makes the tax credit refundable for an investment
 22  5 made by a natural person, and for any other person reduces the
 22  6 carryforward period to three years.
 22  7    The division strikes a provision permitting the EDA
 22  8 to cooperate with small business development centers to
 22  9 disseminate information regarding the credits and to develop
 22 10 standard application forms, and requiring the EDA to distribute
 22 11 copies of the application forms to all community=based seed
 22 12 capital funds and potential individual investors.
 22 13    The division modifies the eligibility requirements for
 22 14 qualifying businesses.  The division strikes the requirement
 22 15 that a business have an owner that meets at least one of
 22 16 four qualifications relating to business education or
 22 17 business experience.  The division requires that a business
 22 18 be participating in an entrepreneurial assistance program,
 22 19 as defined in the division, but allows the EDA to waive this
 22 20 requirement if the business establishes that its owners,
 22 21 directors, officers, and employees have an appropriate level
 22 22 of experience such that an entrepreneurial assistance program
 22 23 would not materially change the prospects of the business.
 22 24 The EDA is allowed to consult with outside service providers
 22 25 in considering such a waiver.  The division increases from $5
 22 26 million to $10 million the maximum amount of net worth that
 22 27 a business may have to be considered a qualifying business.
 22 28 The division increases from $250,000 to $500,000 the amount of
 22 29 financing that a business must have in order to be considered a
 22 30 qualifying business, removes "near equity" from the types of
 22 31 financing that will be considered in that calculation, requires
 22 32 that the financing be secured at the time of application for
 22 33 the tax credits, and requires that the business have at least
 22 34 two investors at the time of application for the tax credits.
 22 35 These modified eligibility requirements apply to businesses
 23  1 that submit an application to the EDA to be registered as a
 23  2 qualifying business on or after the effective date of this
 23  3 division of the bill, and businesses that submitted such an
 23  4 application to the EDA before the effective date of this
 23  5 division of the bill shall be governed by current law.
 23  6    The division provides for the confidentiality of certain
 23  7 information with regard to the tax credit.  The identity of
 23  8 a qualifying business, the identity of an investor and the
 23  9 qualifying business in which the investor made an equity
 23 10 investment, and the total number and amount of tax credits
 23 11 issued shall be considered public information under Code
 23 12 chapter 22 (examination of public records), but any other
 23 13 information or record in the possession of the EDA with respect
 23 14 to the program shall be presumed by the EDA to be a trade secret
 23 15 protected under Code chapter 550 or common law and shall be
 23 16 kept confidential by the EDA unless otherwise ordered by a
 23 17 court.
 23 18    The division takes effect upon enactment and applies to
 23 19 equity investments in a qualifying business made on or after
 23 20 that date.  Equity investments in a qualifying business or
 23 21 community=based seed capital fund made prior to the effective
 23 22 date of the division shall be governed by current law.
 23 23    DIVISION III ==== ENTREPRENEUR INVESTMENT AWARDS PROGRAM.
 23 24  Division III amends the entrepreneur investment awards program
 23 25 administered by the EDA.  The division strikes provisions that
 23 26 prohibited the EDA from making awards under the program since
 23 27 July 1, 2014, and that required the EDA by December 31, 2014,
 23 28 to conduct a comprehensive review of the program and submit
 23 29 a report with specified information to the governor and the
 23 30 general assembly.
 23 31    The division modifies the purpose of the program to be
 23 32 to provide financial assistance to eligible entrepreneurial
 23 33 assistance providers (provider) that provide technical and
 23 34 financial assistance to entrepreneurs and start=up companies
 23 35 seeking to create, locate, or expand a business in Iowa.
 24  1 "Financial assistance" is defined in the division.
 24  2    The division changes the requirements for receiving an
 24  3 award.  To be eligible to receive an award under current
 24  4 law, an entrepreneurial assistance program must have been
 24  5 an Iowa=based business, expended at least $500,000 during
 24  6 the previous fiscal year to provide technical and financial
 24  7 assistance services that meet the broad=based needs of
 24  8 entrepreneurs seeking to create, locate, or expand a business
 24  9 in Iowa that intends to derive more than 10 percent of its
 24 10 gross sales from markets outside Iowa; and must have engaged
 24 11 and communicated with certain other programs, funding sources,
 24 12 and entities for its entrepreneur clients.  The division
 24 13 amends the eligibility for receiving financial assistance to
 24 14 require that a provider have its principal place of operations
 24 15 in Iowa and that the provider offer a comprehensive set of
 24 16 business development services to emerging and early=stage
 24 17 innovation companies to assist in the creation, location,
 24 18 growth, and long=term success of the company in Iowa.
 24 19 "Business development services" is defined in the division.
 24 20 Business development services may be performed at the physical
 24 21 location of the provider or the company and may be provided in
 24 22 consideration of equity participation in the company, a fee for
 24 23 services, or a membership agreement with the company.
 24 24    Under current law, the EDA board could approve, deny, or
 24 25 defer each application for a grant, and was required to award
 24 26 grants on a first=come, first=served basis.  The division
 24 27 specifies that the EDA board has the discretion to approve,
 24 28 deny, or defer each application for financial assistance and
 24 29 that the amount of financial assistance awarded to a provider
 24 30 is within the discretion of the EDA.  The division requires
 24 31 the EDA to award financial assistance on a competitive basis
 24 32 and allows the EDA to develop scoring criteria and establish
 24 33 minimum requirements for the receipt of a financial assistance
 24 34 award.
 24 35    In addition to the four factors relating to the provider's
 25  1 professional staff that the EDA may consider under current
 25  2 law in deciding whether to award financial assistance, the
 25  3 division provides that the EDA may also consider the service
 25  4 model and likelihood of success of the provider, the provider's
 25  5 similarity to other successful providers in the country, and
 25  6 the provider's financial need.
 25  7    The division modifies the maximum award amount for a
 25  8 recipient.  Under current law, a grant to an entrepreneur
 25  9 assistance program cannot exceed the lesser of 25 percent of
 25 10 the funds expended by the program during the previous fiscal
 25 11 year, 100 percent of the funds raised from certain persons
 25 12 by the program during the previous fiscal year, or $200,000.
 25 13 The division provides that the amount of financial assistance
 25 14 awarded to any one provider shall not exceed $200,000.
 25 15    The division modifies the permitted use of funds received
 25 16 under the program.  Under current law, grants are only
 25 17 permitted to be used for the purpose of operating costs
 25 18 incurred by the program.  The division specifies that financial
 25 19 assistance awarded to a provider shall only be used for
 25 20 the purpose of operating costs incurred by the provider in
 25 21 the provision of business development services to emerging
 25 22 and early=stage innovation companies in Iowa.  The division
 25 23 further requires that such financial assistance shall not be
 25 24 distributed to owners or investors of the company to which the
 25 25 business development services are being provided and shall not
 25 26 be provided to other persons assisting with the provision of
 25 27 the services.
 25 28    Under current law, an entrepreneurial assistance provider is
 25 29 required to accept client referrals from the EDA as a condition
 25 30 of receiving a grant.  The division provides that the EDA may
 25 31 make client referrals to eligible providers.
 25 32    DIVISION IV ==== MISCELLANEOUS CHANGES.  Division IV makes
 25 33 several miscellaneous changes to other EDA programs.  The
 25 34 division amends the sales and use tax refund available under
 25 35 the workforce housing tax incentive program.  That refund
 26  1 is available for sales and use tax paid prior to project
 26  2 completion, which is currently defined to mean the first date
 26  3 upon which the average annualized production of finished
 26  4 product for the preceding 90=day period at the manufacturing
 26  5 facility operated by the eligible business is at least 50
 26  6 percent of the initial design capacity of the facility.  The
 26  7 division amends the definition of "project completion" to mean
 26  8 the date on which the EDA notifies the department of revenue
 26  9 that all applicable requirements of a workforce housing tax
 26 10 incentive program agreement are satisfied.  This provision
 26 11 takes effect upon enactment and applies retroactively to July
 26 12 1, 2014, for all workforce housing tax incentive agreements
 26 13 entered into on or after that date.
 26 14    The division allows the EDA to extend the project
 26 15 completion date for a project awarded tax incentives under the
 26 16 redevelopment tax credit program and the housing enterprise
 26 17 zone tax incentives program if the property that is the subject
 26 18 of the project suffered a catastrophic fire during the 2014
 26 19 calendar year.

 18 35 division.  Fourth, the business must not be, in the discretion
 19  1 of the EDA, ineligible under certain provisions relating to the
 19  2 relocation or reduction of business operations within Iowa.
 19  3 Fifth, the business must be in compliance with all agreements
 19  4 entered into under the program or other programs administered
 19  5 by the EDA.
 19  6    An eligible business seeking a tax credit is required
 19  7 to apply to the EDA during the calendar year following the
 19  8 calendar year in which the renewable chemicals are produced.
 19  9 The application must include the amount of renewable chemicals
 19 10 produced in Iowa from biomass feedstock by the eligible
 19 11 business during the calendar year, measured in pounds, and any
 19 12 other information reasonably required by the EDA in order to
 19 13 establish and verify eligibility under the program.  The EDA
 19 14 may accept applications on a continuous basis or may establish
 19 15 an annual application deadline.
 19 16    Before being issued a tax credit, an eligible business
 19 17 is required to enter into an agreement with the EDA for the
 19 18 successful completion of all requirements of the program.  The
 19 19 EDA is authorized to impose two compliance cost fees under the
 19 20 program.  The first fee equals $500 per agreement.  The second
 19 21 fee equals 0.5 percent of the value of the tax credit claimed
 19 22 pursuant to the agreement if the agreement has an aggregate tax
 19 23 credit value of $100,000 or greater.
 19 24    An eligible business that fails to comply with the
 19 25 requirements of the program or the terms of an agreement with
 19 26 the EDA may have its tax credits reduced, terminated, or
 19 27 rescinded, and may be subject to the repayment or recapture of
 19 28 claimed tax credits.
 19 29    Upon determining that all requirements of an agreement and
 19 30 the program have been fulfilled, the EDA shall issue a tax
 19 31 credit and related tax credit certificate to the eligible
 19 32 business in an amount equal to the product of $.05 multiplied
 19 33 by the number of pounds of renewable chemicals produced in Iowa
 19 34 from biomass feedstock by the eligible business during the
 19 35 calendar year.  Renewable chemicals produced by an eligible
 20  1 business prior to the effective date of the division, or
 20  2 prior to the date the business first qualifies as an eligible
 20  3 business, or after calendar year 2025, shall not qualify for
 20  4 the tax credit.
 20  5    The tax credit shall be claimed for the tax year during
 20  6 which the eligible business was issued the tax credit.  The tax
 20  7 credit may be claimed against the individual income tax and the
 20  8 corporate income tax.  The credit is refundable or may, at the
 20  9 election of the taxpayer, be carried forward for up to one tax
 20 10 year.   The tax credit shall not be transferred to any person.  A
 20 11 tax credit issued to a partnership, limited liability company,
 20 12 S corporation, cooperative organized under Code chapter 501
 20 13 and filing as a partnership for federal tax purposes, estate,
 20 14 or trust electing to have the income taxed directly to the
 20 15 individual may be claimed by the individual based upon the pro
 20 16 rata share of the individual's earnings from that entity.
 20 17    The division provides that the program is subject to the
 20 18 EDA's maximum aggregate tax credit cap of $170 million per
 20 19 fiscal year in Code section 15.119, and not more than $15
 20 20 million per fiscal year may be issued by the EDA under the
 20 21 program.  In addition, the maximum amount of tax credit that
 20 22 may be issued to an eligible business in any one calendar year
 20 23 shall not exceed $1 million or $500,000, depending on whether
 20 24 the eligible business has been operating in Iowa at the time of
 20 25 application for five or fewer years, or more than five years,
 20 26 respectively.  An eligible business shall not receive more than
 20 27 five tax credits under the program.  The EDA is required to
 20 28 issue tax credits on a first=come, first=served basis until the
 20 29 maximum amount of $15 million per fiscal year is reached.  If
 20 30 the amount of tax credits exceeds this amount in a fiscal year,
 20 31 the EDA is required to establish a wait list and give priority
 20 32 in subsequent years to the eligible businesses on the wait
 20 33 list.
 20 34    The division provides for the confidentiality of certain
 20 35 information under the program.  The identity of a tax credit
 21  1 recipient and the amount of the tax credit shall be considered
 21  2 public information under Code chapter 22 (examination of public
 21  3 records), but any other information or record in the possession
 21  4 of the EDA with respect to the program shall be presumed by
 21  5 the EDA to be a trade secret protected under Code chapter 550
 21  6 or common law and shall be kept confidential by the EDA unless
 21  7 otherwise ordered by a court.
 21  8    The division takes effect upon enactment and applies to
 21  9 renewable chemicals produced in Iowa from biomass feedstock on
 21 10 or after that date.  The division applies retroactively to tax
 21 11 years beginning on or after January 1, 2015.
 21 12    DIVISION II ==== ANGEL INVESTOR TAX CREDITS.   Division II
 21 13 makes several changes to the tax credit for investments in
 21 14 qualifying businesses and community=based seed capital funds,
 21 15 often referred to as the angel investor tax credits.  The
 21 16 division amends the purpose of the tax credit in Code section
 21 17 15E.41.  The division excludes investments in community=based
 21 18 seed capital funds from qualifying for the tax credit and
 21 19 makes several conforming amendments to remove references to
 21 20 community=based seed capital funds from the Code.
 21 21    The division modifies the amount and dollar limitation of
 21 22 the tax credit for a taxpayer.  The tax credit is increased
 21 23 from 20 percent to 25 percent of a taxpayer's equity investment
 21 24 in a qualifying business.  Under current law, a taxpayer cannot
 21 25 claim more than $50,000 of tax credit per investment in a
 21 26 qualifying business, and for each tax year a taxpayer and the
 21 27 taxpayer's affiliates cannot claim tax credits for more than
 21 28 five investments in five different qualifying businesses.  The
 21 29 division amends this dollar limitation to prohibit a natural
 21 30 person and the person's spouse, child, or sibling from claiming
 21 31 a combined amount of more than $100,000 in tax credits per tax
 21 32 year.
 21 33    The division also provides that no more than $500,000 in tax
 21 34 credits may be issued per tax year for equity investments in
 21 35 any one qualifying business.
 22  1 The division modifies the procedures for claiming the tax
 22  2 credit.  Under current law, the tax credit is not refundable
 22  3 but available for carryforward for up to five tax years.  The
 22  4 division makes the tax credit refundable for an investment
 22  5 made by a natural person, and for any other person reduces the
 22  6 carryforward period to three years.
 22  7    The division strikes a provision permitting the EDA
 22  8 to cooperate with small business development centers to
 22  9 disseminate information regarding the credits and to develop
 22 10 standard application forms, and requiring the EDA to distribute
 22 11 copies of the application forms to all community=based seed
 22 12 capital funds and potential individual investors.
 22 13    The division modifies the eligibility requirements for
 22 14 qualifying businesses.  The division strikes the requirement
 22 15 that a business have an owner that meets at least one of
 22 16 four qualifications relating to business education or
 22 17 business experience.  The division requires that a business
 22 18 be participating in an entrepreneurial assistance program,
 22 19 as defined in the division, but allows the EDA to waive this
 22 20 requirement if the business establishes that its owners,
 22 21 directors, officers, and employees have an appropriate level
 22 22 of experience such that an entrepreneurial assistance program
 22 23 would not materially change the prospects of the business.
 22 24 The EDA is allowed to consult with outside service providers
 22 25 in considering such a waiver.  The division increases from $5
 22 26 million to $10 million the maximum amount of net worth that
 22 27 a business may have to be considered a qualifying business.
 22 28 The division increases from $250,000 to $500,000 the amount of
 22 29 financing that a business must have in order to be considered a
 22 30 qualifying business, removes "near equity" from the types of
 22 31 financing that will be considered in that calculation, requires
 22 32 that the financing be secured at the time of application for
 22 33 the tax credits, and requires that the business have at least
 22 34 two investors at the time of application for the tax credits.
 22 35 These modified eligibility requirements apply to businesses
 23  1 that submit an application to the EDA to be registered as a
 23  2 qualifying business on or after the effective date of this
 23  3 division of the bill, and businesses that submitted such an
 23  4 application to the EDA before the effective date of this
 23  5 division of the bill shall be governed by current law.
 23  6    The division provides for the confidentiality of certain
 23  7 information with regard to the tax credit.  The identity of
 23  8 a qualifying business, the identity of an investor and the
 23  9 qualifying business in which the investor made an equity
 23 10 investment, and the total number and amount of tax credits
 23 11 issued shall be considered public information under Code
 23 12 chapter 22 (examination of public records), but any other
 23 13 information or record in the possession of the EDA with respect
 23 14 to the program shall be presumed by the EDA to be a trade secret
 23 15 protected under Code chapter 550 or common law and shall be
 23 16 kept confidential by the EDA unless otherwise ordered by a
 23 17 court.
 23 18    The division takes effect upon enactment and applies to
 23 19 equity investments in a qualifying business made on or after
 23 20 that date.  Equity investments in a qualifying business or
 23 21 community=based seed capital fund made prior to the effective
 23 22 date of the division shall be governed by current law.
 23 23    DIVISION III ==== ENTREPRENEUR INVESTMENT AWARDS PROGRAM.
 23 24  Division III amends the entrepreneur investment awards program
 23 25 administered by the EDA.  The division strikes provisions that
 23 26 prohibited the EDA from making awards under the program since
 23 27 July 1, 2014, and that required the EDA by December 31, 2014,
 23 28 to conduct a comprehensive review of the program and submit
 23 29 a report with specified information to the governor and the
 23 30 general assembly.
 23 31    The division modifies the purpose of the program to be
 23 32 to provide financial assistance to eligible entrepreneurial
 23 33 assistance providers (provider) that provide technical and
 23 34 financial assistance to entrepreneurs and start=up companies
 23 35 seeking to create, locate, or expand a business in Iowa.
 24  1 "Financial assistance" is defined in the division.
 24  2    The division changes the requirements for receiving an
 24  3 award.  To be eligible to receive an award under current
 24  4 law, an entrepreneurial assistance program must have been
 24  5 an Iowa=based business, expended at least $500,000 during
 24  6 the previous fiscal year to provide technical and financial
 24  7 assistance services that meet the broad=based needs of
 24  8 entrepreneurs seeking to create, locate, or expand a business
 24  9 in Iowa that intends to derive more than 10 percent of its
 24 10 gross sales from markets outside Iowa; and must have engaged
 24 11 and communicated with certain other programs, funding sources,
 24 12 and entities for its entrepreneur clients.  The division
 24 13 amends the eligibility for receiving financial assistance to
 24 14 require that a provider have its principal place of operations
 24 15 in Iowa and that the provider offer a comprehensive set of
 24 16 business development services to emerging and early=stage
 24 17 innovation companies to assist in the creation, location,
 24 18 growth, and long=term success of the company in Iowa.
 24 19 "Business development services" is defined in the division.
 24 20 Business development services may be performed at the physical
 24 21 location of the provider or the company and may be provided in
 24 22 consideration of equity participation in the company, a fee for
 24 23 services, or a membership agreement with the company.
 24 24    Under current law, the EDA board could approve, deny, or
 24 25 defer each application for a grant, and was required to award
 24 26 grants on a first=come, first=served basis.  The division
 24 27 specifies that the EDA board has the discretion to approve,
 24 28 deny, or defer each application for financial assistance and
 24 29 that the amount of financial assistance awarded to a provider
 24 30 is within the discretion of the EDA.  The division requires
 24 31 the EDA to award financial assistance on a competitive basis
 24 32 and allows the EDA to develop scoring criteria and establish
 24 33 minimum requirements for the receipt of a financial assistance
 24 34 award.
 24 35    In addition to the four factors relating to the provider's
 25  1 professional staff that the EDA may consider under current
 25  2 law in deciding whether to award financial assistance, the
 25  3 division provides that the EDA may also consider the service
 25  4 model and likelihood of success of the provider, the provider's
 25  5 similarity to other successful providers in the country, and
 25  6 the provider's financial need.
 25  7    The division modifies the maximum award amount for a
 25  8 recipient.  Under current law, a grant to an entrepreneur
 25  9 assistance program cannot exceed the lesser of 25 percent of
 25 10 the funds expended by the program during the previous fiscal
 25 11 year, 100 percent of the funds raised from certain persons
 25 12 by the program during the previous fiscal year, or $200,000.
 25 13 The division provides that the amount of financial assistance
 25 14 awarded to any one provider shall not exceed $200,000.
 25 15    The division modifies the permitted use of funds received
 25 16 under the program.  Under current law, grants are only
 25 17 permitted to be used for the purpose of operating costs
 25 18 incurred by the program.  The division specifies that financial
 25 19 assistance awarded to a provider shall only be used for
 25 20 the purpose of operating costs incurred by the provider in
 25 21 the provision of business development services to emerging
 25 22 and early=stage innovation companies in Iowa.  The division
 25 23 further requires that such financial assistance shall not be
 25 24 distributed to owners or investors of the company to which the
 25 25 business development services are being provided and shall not
 25 26 be provided to other persons assisting with the provision of
 25 27 the services.
 25 28    Under current law, an entrepreneurial assistance provider is
 25 29 required to accept client referrals from the EDA as a condition
 25 30 of receiving a grant.  The division provides that the EDA may
 25 31 make client referrals to eligible providers.
 25 32    DIVISION IV ==== MISCELLANEOUS CHANGES.  Division IV makes
 25 33 several miscellaneous changes to other EDA programs.  The
 25 34 division amends the sales and use tax refund available under
 25 35 the workforce housing tax incentive program.  That refund
 26  1 is available for sales and use tax paid prior to project
 26  2 completion, which is currently defined to mean the first date
 26  3 upon which the average annualized production of finished
 26  4 product for the preceding 90=day period at the manufacturing
 26  5 facility operated by the eligible business is at least 50
 26  6 percent of the initial design capacity of the facility.  The
 26  7 division amends the definition of "project completion" to mean
 26  8 the date on which the EDA notifies the department of revenue
 26  9 that all applicable requirements of a workforce housing tax
 26 10 incentive program agreement are satisfied.  This provision
 26 11 takes effect upon enactment and applies retroactively to July
 26 12 1, 2014, for all workforce housing tax incentive agreements
 26 13 entered into on or after that date.
 26 14    The division allows the EDA to extend the project
 26 15 completion date for a project awarded tax incentives under the
 26 16 redevelopment tax credit program and the housing enterprise
 26 17 zone tax incentives program if the property that is the subject
 26 18 of the project suffered a catastrophic fire during the 2014
 26 19 calendar year.
       LSB 1212HV (3) 86
       mm/sc
 19  1 of the EDA, ineligible under certain provisions relating to the
 19  2 relocation or reduction of business operations within Iowa.
 19  3 Fifth, the business must be in compliance with all agreements
 19  4 entered into under the program or other programs administered
 19  5 by the EDA.
 19  6    An eligible business seeking a tax credit is required
 19  7 to apply to the EDA during the calendar year following the
 19  8 calendar year in which the renewable chemicals are produced.
 19  9 The application must include the amount of renewable chemicals
 19 10 produced in Iowa from biomass feedstock by the eligible
 19 11 business during the calendar year, measured in pounds, and any
 19 12 other information reasonably required by the EDA in order to
 19 13 establish and verify eligibility under the program.  The EDA
 19 14 may accept applications on a continuous basis or may establish
 19 15 an annual application deadline.
 19 16    Before being issued a tax credit, an eligible business
 19 17 is required to enter into an agreement with the EDA for the
 19 18 successful completion of all requirements of the program.  The
 19 19 EDA is authorized to impose two compliance cost fees under the
 19 20 program.  The first fee equals $500 per agreement.  The second
 19 21 fee equals 0.5 percent of the value of the tax credit claimed
 19 22 pursuant to the agreement if the agreement has an aggregate tax
 19 23 credit value of $100,000 or greater.
 19 24    An eligible business that fails to comply with the
 19 25 requirements of the program or the terms of an agreement with
 19 26 the EDA may have its tax credits reduced, terminated, or
 19 27 rescinded, and may be subject to the repayment or recapture of
 19 28 claimed tax credits.
 19 29    Upon determining that all requirements of an agreement and
 19 30 the program have been fulfilled, the EDA shall issue a tax
 19 31 credit and related tax credit certificate to the eligible
 19 32 business in an amount equal to the product of $.05 multiplied
 19 33 by the number of pounds of renewable chemicals produced in Iowa
 19 34 from biomass feedstock by the eligible business during the
 19 35 calendar year.  Renewable chemicals produced by an eligible
 20  1 business prior to the effective date of the division, or
 20  2 prior to the date the business first qualifies as an eligible
 20  3 business, or after calendar year 2025, shall not qualify for
 20  4 the tax credit.
 20  5    The tax credit shall be claimed for the tax year during
 20  6 which the eligible business was issued the tax credit.  The tax
 20  7 credit may be claimed against the individual income tax and the
 20  8 corporate income tax.  The credit is refundable or may, at the
 20  9 election of the taxpayer, be carried forward for up to one tax
 20 10 year.   The tax credit shall not be transferred to any person.  A
 20 11 tax credit issued to a partnership, limited liability company,
 20 12 S corporation, cooperative organized under Code chapter 501
 20 13 and filing as a partnership for federal tax purposes, estate,
 20 14 or trust electing to have the income taxed directly to the
 20 15 individual may be claimed by the individual based upon the pro
 20 16 rata share of the individual's earnings from that entity.
 20 17    The division provides that the program is subject to the
 20 18 EDA's maximum aggregate tax credit cap of $170 million per
 20 19 fiscal year in Code section 15.119, and not more than $15
 20 20 million per fiscal year may be issued by the EDA under the
 20 21 program.  In addition, the maximum amount of tax credit that
 20 22 may be issued to an eligible business in any one calendar year
 20 23 shall not exceed $1 million or $500,000, depending on whether
 20 24 the eligible business has been operating in Iowa at the time of
 20 25 application for five or fewer years, or more than five years,
 20 26 respectively.  An eligible business shall not receive more than
 20 27 five tax credits under the program.  The EDA is required to
 20 28 issue tax credits on a first=come, first=served basis until the
 20 29 maximum amount of $15 million per fiscal year is reached.  If
 20 30 the amount of tax credits exceeds this amount in a fiscal year,
 20 31 the EDA is required to establish a wait list and give priority
 20 32 in subsequent years to the eligible businesses on the wait
 20 33 list.
 20 34    The division provides for the confidentiality of certain
 20 35 information under the program.  The identity of a tax credit
 21  1 recipient and the amount of the tax credit shall be considered
 21  2 public information under Code chapter 22 (examination of public
 21  3 records), but any other information or record in the possession
 21  4 of the EDA with respect to the program shall be presumed by
 21  5 the EDA to be a trade secret protected under Code chapter 550
 21  6 or common law and shall be kept confidential by the EDA unless
 21  7 otherwise ordered by a court.
 21  8    The division takes effect upon enactment and applies to
 21  9 renewable chemicals produced in Iowa from biomass feedstock on
 21 10 or after that date.  The division applies retroactively to tax
 21 11 years beginning on or after January 1, 2015.
 21 12    DIVISION II ==== ANGEL INVESTOR TAX CREDITS.   Division II
 21 13 makes several changes to the tax credit for investments in
 21 14 qualifying businesses and community=based seed capital funds,
 21 15 often referred to as the angel investor tax credits.  The
 21 16 division amends the purpose of the tax credit in Code section
 21 17 15E.41.  The division excludes investments in community=based
 21 18 seed capital funds from qualifying for the tax credit and
 21 19 makes several conforming amendments to remove references to
 21 20 community=based seed capital funds from the Code.
 21 21    The division modifies the amount and dollar limitation of
 21 22 the tax credit for a taxpayer.  The tax credit is increased
 21 23 from 20 percent to 25 percent of a taxpayer's equity investment
 21 24 in a qualifying business.  Under current law, a taxpayer cannot
 21 25 claim more than $50,000 of tax credit per investment in a
 21 26 qualifying business, and for each tax year a taxpayer and the
 21 27 taxpayer's affiliates cannot claim tax credits for more than
 21 28 five investments in five different qualifying businesses.  The
 21 29 division amends this dollar limitation to prohibit a natural
 21 30 person and the person's spouse, child, or sibling from claiming
 21 31 a combined amount of more than $100,000 in tax credits per tax
 21 32 year.
 21 33    The division also provides that no more than $500,000 in tax
 21 34 credits may be issued per tax year for equity investments in
 21 35 any one qualifying business.
 22  1 The division modifies the procedures for claiming the tax
 22  2 credit.  Under current law, the tax credit is not refundable
 22  3 but available for carryforward for up to five tax years.  The
 22  4 division makes the tax credit refundable for an investment
 22  5 made by a natural person, and for any other person reduces the
 22  6 carryforward period to three years.
 22  7    The division strikes a provision permitting the EDA
 22  8 to cooperate with small business development centers to
 22  9 disseminate information regarding the credits and to develop
 22 10 standard application forms, and requiring the EDA to distribute
 22 11 copies of the application forms to all community=based seed
 22 12 capital funds and potential individual investors.
 22 13    The division modifies the eligibility requirements for
 22 14 qualifying businesses.  The division strikes the requirement
 22 15 that a business have an owner that meets at least one of
 22 16 four qualifications relating to business education or
 22 17 business experience.  The division requires that a business
 22 18 be participating in an entrepreneurial assistance program,
 22 19 as defined in the division, but allows the EDA to waive this
 22 20 requirement if the business establishes that its owners,
 22 21 directors, officers, and employees have an appropriate level
 22 22 of experience such that an entrepreneurial assistance program
 22 23 would not materially change the prospects of the business.
 22 24 The EDA is allowed to consult with outside service providers
 22 25 in considering such a waiver.  The division increases from $5
 22 26 million to $10 million the maximum amount of net worth that
 22 27 a business may have to be considered a qualifying business.
 22 28 The division increases from $250,000 to $500,000 the amount of
 22 29 financing that a business must have in order to be considered a
 22 30 qualifying business, removes "near equity" from the types of
 22 31 financing that will be considered in that calculation, requires
 22 32 that the financing be secured at the time of application for
 22 33 the tax credits, and requires that the business have at least
 22 34 two investors at the time of application for the tax credits.
 22 35 These modified eligibility requirements apply to businesses
 23  1 that submit an application to the EDA to be registered as a
 23  2 qualifying business on or after the effective date of this
 23  3 division of the bill, and businesses that submitted such an
 23  4 application to the EDA before the effective date of this
 23  5 division of the bill shall be governed by current law.
 23  6    The division provides for the confidentiality of certain
 23  7 information with regard to the tax credit.  The identity of
 23  8 a qualifying business, the identity of an investor and the
 23  9 qualifying business in which the investor made an equity
 23 10 investment, and the total number and amount of tax credits
 23 11 issued shall be considered public information under Code
 23 12 chapter 22 (examination of public records), but any other
 23 13 information or record in the possession of the EDA with respect
 23 14 to the program shall be presumed by the EDA to be a trade secret
 23 15 protected under Code chapter 550 or common law and shall be
 23 16 kept confidential by the EDA unless otherwise ordered by a
 23 17 court.
 23 18    The division takes effect upon enactment and applies to
 23 19 equity investments in a qualifying business made on or after
 23 20 that date.  Equity investments in a qualifying business or
 23 21 community=based seed capital fund made prior to the effective
 23 22 date of the division shall be governed by current law.
 23 23    DIVISION III ==== ENTREPRENEUR INVESTMENT AWARDS PROGRAM.
 23 24  Division III amends the entrepreneur investment awards program
 23 25 administered by the EDA.  The division strikes provisions that
 23 26 prohibited the EDA from making awards under the program since
 23 27 July 1, 2014, and that required the EDA by December 31, 2014,
 23 28 to conduct a comprehensive review of the program and submit
 23 29 a report with specified information to the governor and the
 23 30 general assembly.
 23 31    The division modifies the purpose of the program to be
 23 32 to provide financial assistance to eligible entrepreneurial
 23 33 assistance providers (provider) that provide technical and
 23 34 financial assistance to entrepreneurs and start=up companies
 23 35 seeking to create, locate, or expand a business in Iowa.
 24  1 "Financial assistance" is defined in the division.
 24  2    The division changes the requirements for receiving an
 24  3 award.  To be eligible to receive an award under current
 24  4 law, an entrepreneurial assistance program must have been
 24  5 an Iowa=based business, expended at least $500,000 during
 24  6 the previous fiscal year to provide technical and financial
 24  7 assistance services that meet the broad=based needs of
 24  8 entrepreneurs seeking to create, locate, or expand a business
 24  9 in Iowa that intends to derive more than 10 percent of its
 24 10 gross sales from markets outside Iowa; and must have engaged
 24 11 and communicated with certain other programs, funding sources,
 24 12 and entities for its entrepreneur clients.  The division
 24 13 amends the eligibility for receiving financial assistance to
 24 14 require that a provider have its principal place of operations
 24 15 in Iowa and that the provider offer a comprehensive set of
 24 16 business development services to emerging and early=stage
 24 17 innovation companies to assist in the creation, location,
 24 18 growth, and long=term success of the company in Iowa.
 24 19 "Business development services" is defined in the division.
 24 20 Business development services may be performed at the physical
 24 21 location of the provider or the company and may be provided in
 24 22 consideration of equity participation in the company, a fee for
 24 23 services, or a membership agreement with the company.
 24 24    Under current law, the EDA board could approve, deny, or
 24 25 defer each application for a grant, and was required to award
 24 26 grants on a first=come, first=served basis.  The division
 24 27 specifies that the EDA board has the discretion to approve,
 24 28 deny, or defer each application for financial assistance and
 24 29 that the amount of financial assistance awarded to a provider
 24 30 is within the discretion of the EDA.  The division requires
 24 31 the EDA to award financial assistance on a competitive basis
 24 32 and allows the EDA to develop scoring criteria and establish
 24 33 minimum requirements for the receipt of a financial assistance
 24 34 award.
 24 35    In addition to the four factors relating to the provider's
 25  1 professional staff that the EDA may consider under current
 25  2 law in deciding whether to award financial assistance, the
 25  3 division provides that the EDA may also consider the service
 25  4 model and likelihood of success of the provider, the provider's
 25  5 similarity to other successful providers in the country, and
 25  6 the provider's financial need.
 25  7    The division modifies the maximum award amount for a
 25  8 recipient.  Under current law, a grant to an entrepreneur
 25  9 assistance program cannot exceed the lesser of 25 percent of
 25 10 the funds expended by the program during the previous fiscal
 25 11 year, 100 percent of the funds raised from certain persons
 25 12 by the program during the previous fiscal year, or $200,000.
 25 13 The division provides that the amount of financial assistance
 25 14 awarded to any one provider shall not exceed $200,000.
 25 15    The division modifies the permitted use of funds received
 25 16 under the program.  Under current law, grants are only
 25 17 permitted to be used for the purpose of operating costs
 25 18 incurred by the program.  The division specifies that financial
 25 19 assistance awarded to a provider shall only be used for
 25 20 the purpose of operating costs incurred by the provider in
 25 21 the provision of business development services to emerging
 25 22 and early=stage innovation companies in Iowa.  The division
 25 23 further requires that such financial assistance shall not be
 25 24 distributed to owners or investors of the company to which the
 25 25 business development services are being provided and shall not
 25 26 be provided to other persons assisting with the provision of
 25 27 the services.
 25 28    Under current law, an entrepreneurial assistance provider is
 25 29 required to accept client referrals from the EDA as a condition
 25 30 of receiving a grant.  The division provides that the EDA may
 25 31 make client referrals to eligible providers.
 25 32    DIVISION IV ==== MISCELLANEOUS CHANGES.  Division IV makes
 25 33 several miscellaneous changes to other EDA programs.  The
 25 34 division amends the sales and use tax refund available under
 25 35 the workforce housing tax incentive program.  That refund
 26  1 is available for sales and use tax paid prior to project
 26  2 completion, which is currently defined to mean the first date
 26  3 upon which the average annualized production of finished
 26  4 product for the preceding 90=day period at the manufacturing
 26  5 facility operated by the eligible business is at least 50
 26  6 percent of the initial design capacity of the facility.  The
 26  7 division amends the definition of "project completion" to mean
 26  8 the date on which the EDA notifies the department of revenue
 26  9 that all applicable requirements of a workforce housing tax
 26 10 incentive program agreement are satisfied.  This provision
 26 11 takes effect upon enactment and applies retroactively to July
 26 12 1, 2014, for all workforce housing tax incentive agreements
 26 13 entered into on or after that date.
 26 14    The division allows the EDA to extend the project
 26 15 completion date for a project awarded tax incentives under the
 26 16 redevelopment tax credit program and the housing enterprise
 26 17 zone tax incentives program if the property that is the subject
 26 18 of the project suffered a catastrophic fire during the 2014
 26 19 calendar year.

       mm/sc
 19  2 relocation or reduction of business operations within Iowa.
 19  3 Fifth, the business must be in compliance with all agreements
 19  4 entered into under the program or other programs administered
 19  5 by the EDA.
 19  6    An eligible business seeking a tax credit is required
 19  7 to apply to the EDA during the calendar year following the
 19  8 calendar year in which the renewable chemicals are produced.
 19  9 The application must include the amount of renewable chemicals
 19 10 produced in Iowa from biomass feedstock by the eligible
 19 11 business during the calendar year, measured in pounds, and any
 19 12 other information reasonably required by the EDA in order to
 19 13 establish and verify eligibility under the program.  The EDA
 19 14 may accept applications on a continuous basis or may establish
 19 15 an annual application deadline.
 19 16    Before being issued a tax credit, an eligible business
 19 17 is required to enter into an agreement with the EDA for the
 19 18 successful completion of all requirements of the program.  The
 19 19 EDA is authorized to impose two compliance cost fees under the
 19 20 program.  The first fee equals $500 per agreement.  The second
 19 21 fee equals 0.5 percent of the value of the tax credit claimed
 19 22 pursuant to the agreement if the agreement has an aggregate tax
 19 23 credit value of $100,000 or greater.
 19 24    An eligible business that fails to comply with the
 19 25 requirements of the program or the terms of an agreement with
 19 26 the EDA may have its tax credits reduced, terminated, or
 19 27 rescinded, and may be subject to the repayment or recapture of
 19 28 claimed tax credits.
 19 29    Upon determining that all requirements of an agreement and
 19 30 the program have been fulfilled, the EDA shall issue a tax
 19 31 credit and related tax credit certificate to the eligible
 19 32 business in an amount equal to the product of $.05 multiplied
 19 33 by the number of pounds of renewable chemicals produced in Iowa
 19 34 from biomass feedstock by the eligible business during the
 19 35 calendar year.  Renewable chemicals produced by an eligible
 20  1 business prior to the effective date of the division, or
 20  2 prior to the date the business first qualifies as an eligible
 20  3 business, or after calendar year 2025, shall not qualify for
 20  4 the tax credit.
 20  5    The tax credit shall be claimed for the tax year during
 20  6 which the eligible business was issued the tax credit.  The tax
 20  7 credit may be claimed against the individual income tax and the
 20  8 corporate income tax.  The credit is refundable or may, at the
 20  9 election of the taxpayer, be carried forward for up to one tax
 20 10 year.   The tax credit shall not be transferred to any person.  A
 20 11 tax credit issued to a partnership, limited liability company,
 20 12 S corporation, cooperative organized under Code chapter 501
 20 13 and filing as a partnership for federal tax purposes, estate,
 20 14 or trust electing to have the income taxed directly to the
 20 15 individual may be claimed by the individual based upon the pro
 20 16 rata share of the individual's earnings from that entity.
 20 17    The division provides that the program is subject to the
 20 18 EDA's maximum aggregate tax credit cap of $170 million per
 20 19 fiscal year in Code section 15.119, and not more than $15
 20 20 million per fiscal year may be issued by the EDA under the
 20 21 program.  In addition, the maximum amount of tax credit that
 20 22 may be issued to an eligible business in any one calendar year
 20 23 shall not exceed $1 million or $500,000, depending on whether
 20 24 the eligible business has been operating in Iowa at the time of
 20 25 application for five or fewer years, or more than five years,
 20 26 respectively.  An eligible business shall not receive more than
 20 27 five tax credits under the program.  The EDA is required to
 20 28 issue tax credits on a first=come, first=served basis until the
 20 29 maximum amount of $15 million per fiscal year is reached.  If
 20 30 the amount of tax credits exceeds this amount in a fiscal year,
 20 31 the EDA is required to establish a wait list and give priority
 20 32 in subsequent years to the eligible businesses on the wait
 20 33 list.
 20 34    The division provides for the confidentiality of certain
 20 35 information under the program.  The identity of a tax credit
 21  1 recipient and the amount of the tax credit shall be considered
 21  2 public information under Code chapter 22 (examination of public
 21  3 records), but any other information or record in the possession
 21  4 of the EDA with respect to the program shall be presumed by
 21  5 the EDA to be a trade secret protected under Code chapter 550
 21  6 or common law and shall be kept confidential by the EDA unless
 21  7 otherwise ordered by a court.
 21  8    The division takes effect upon enactment and applies to
 21  9 renewable chemicals produced in Iowa from biomass feedstock on
 21 10 or after that date.  The division applies retroactively to tax
 21 11 years beginning on or after January 1, 2015.
 21 12    DIVISION II ==== ANGEL INVESTOR TAX CREDITS.   Division II
 21 13 makes several changes to the tax credit for investments in
 21 14 qualifying businesses and community=based seed capital funds,
 21 15 often referred to as the angel investor tax credits.  The
 21 16 division amends the purpose of the tax credit in Code section
 21 17 15E.41.  The division excludes investments in community=based
 21 18 seed capital funds from qualifying for the tax credit and
 21 19 makes several conforming amendments to remove references to
 21 20 community=based seed capital funds from the Code.
 21 21    The division modifies the amount and dollar limitation of
 21 22 the tax credit for a taxpayer.  The tax credit is increased
 21 23 from 20 percent to 25 percent of a taxpayer's equity investment
 21 24 in a qualifying business.  Under current law, a taxpayer cannot
 21 25 claim more than $50,000 of tax credit per investment in a
 21 26 qualifying business, and for each tax year a taxpayer and the
 21 27 taxpayer's affiliates cannot claim tax credits for more than
 21 28 five investments in five different qualifying businesses.  The
 21 29 division amends this dollar limitation to prohibit a natural
 21 30 person and the person's spouse, child, or sibling from claiming
 21 31 a combined amount of more than $100,000 in tax credits per tax
 21 32 year.
 21 33    The division also provides that no more than $500,000 in tax
 21 34 credits may be issued per tax year for equity investments in
 21 35 any one qualifying business.
 22  1 The division modifies the procedures for claiming the tax
 22  2 credit.  Under current law, the tax credit is not refundable
 22  3 but available for carryforward for up to five tax years.  The
 22  4 division makes the tax credit refundable for an investment
 22  5 made by a natural person, and for any other person reduces the
 22  6 carryforward period to three years.
 22  7    The division strikes a provision permitting the EDA
 22  8 to cooperate with small business development centers to
 22  9 disseminate information regarding the credits and to develop
 22 10 standard application forms, and requiring the EDA to distribute
 22 11 copies of the application forms to all community=based seed
 22 12 capital funds and potential individual investors.
 22 13    The division modifies the eligibility requirements for
 22 14 qualifying businesses.  The division strikes the requirement
 22 15 that a business have an owner that meets at least one of
 22 16 four qualifications relating to business education or
 22 17 business experience.  The division requires that a business
 22 18 be participating in an entrepreneurial assistance program,
 22 19 as defined in the division, but allows the EDA to waive this
 22 20 requirement if the business establishes that its owners,
 22 21 directors, officers, and employees have an appropriate level
 22 22 of experience such that an entrepreneurial assistance program
 22 23 would not materially change the prospects of the business.
 22 24 The EDA is allowed to consult with outside service providers
 22 25 in considering such a waiver.  The division increases from $5
 22 26 million to $10 million the maximum amount of net worth that
 22 27 a business may have to be considered a qualifying business.
 22 28 The division increases from $250,000 to $500,000 the amount of
 22 29 financing that a business must have in order to be considered a
 22 30 qualifying business, removes "near equity" from the types of
 22 31 financing that will be considered in that calculation, requires
 22 32 that the financing be secured at the time of application for
 22 33 the tax credits, and requires that the business have at least
 22 34 two investors at the time of application for the tax credits.
 22 35 These modified eligibility requirements apply to businesses
 23  1 that submit an application to the EDA to be registered as a
 23  2 qualifying business on or after the effective date of this
 23  3 division of the bill, and businesses that submitted such an
 23  4 application to the EDA before the effective date of this
 23  5 division of the bill shall be governed by current law.
 23  6    The division provides for the confidentiality of certain
 23  7 information with regard to the tax credit.  The identity of
 23  8 a qualifying business, the identity of an investor and the
 23  9 qualifying business in which the investor made an equity
 23 10 investment, and the total number and amount of tax credits
 23 11 issued shall be considered public information under Code
 23 12 chapter 22 (examination of public records), but any other
 23 13 information or record in the possession of the EDA with respect
 23 14 to the program shall be presumed by the EDA to be a trade secret
 23 15 protected under Code chapter 550 or common law and shall be
 23 16 kept confidential by the EDA unless otherwise ordered by a
 23 17 court.
 23 18    The division takes effect upon enactment and applies to
 23 19 equity investments in a qualifying business made on or after
 23 20 that date.  Equity investments in a qualifying business or
 23 21 community=based seed capital fund made prior to the effective
 23 22 date of the division shall be governed by current law.
 23 23    DIVISION III ==== ENTREPRENEUR INVESTMENT AWARDS PROGRAM.
 23 24  Division III amends the entrepreneur investment awards program
 23 25 administered by the EDA.  The division strikes provisions that
 23 26 prohibited the EDA from making awards under the program since
 23 27 July 1, 2014, and that required the EDA by December 31, 2014,
 23 28 to conduct a comprehensive review of the program and submit
 23 29 a report with specified information to the governor and the
 23 30 general assembly.
 23 31    The division modifies the purpose of the program to be
 23 32 to provide financial assistance to eligible entrepreneurial
 23 33 assistance providers (provider) that provide technical and
 23 34 financial assistance to entrepreneurs and start=up companies
 23 35 seeking to create, locate, or expand a business in Iowa.
 24  1 "Financial assistance" is defined in the division.
 24  2    The division changes the requirements for receiving an
 24  3 award.  To be eligible to receive an award under current
 24  4 law, an entrepreneurial assistance program must have been
 24  5 an Iowa=based business, expended at least $500,000 during
 24  6 the previous fiscal year to provide technical and financial
 24  7 assistance services that meet the broad=based needs of
 24  8 entrepreneurs seeking to create, locate, or expand a business
 24  9 in Iowa that intends to derive more than 10 percent of its
 24 10 gross sales from markets outside Iowa; and must have engaged
 24 11 and communicated with certain other programs, funding sources,
 24 12 and entities for its entrepreneur clients.  The division
 24 13 amends the eligibility for receiving financial assistance to
 24 14 require that a provider have its principal place of operations
 24 15 in Iowa and that the provider offer a comprehensive set of
 24 16 business development services to emerging and early=stage
 24 17 innovation companies to assist in the creation, location,
 24 18 growth, and long=term success of the company in Iowa.
 24 19 "Business development services" is defined in the division.
 24 20 Business development services may be performed at the physical
 24 21 location of the provider or the company and may be provided in
 24 22 consideration of equity participation in the company, a fee for
 24 23 services, or a membership agreement with the company.
 24 24    Under current law, the EDA board could approve, deny, or
 24 25 defer each application for a grant, and was required to award
 24 26 grants on a first=come, first=served basis.  The division
 24 27 specifies that the EDA board has the discretion to approve,
 24 28 deny, or defer each application for financial assistance and
 24 29 that the amount of financial assistance awarded to a provider
 24 30 is within the discretion of the EDA.  The division requires
 24 31 the EDA to award financial assistance on a competitive basis
 24 32 and allows the EDA to develop scoring criteria and establish
 24 33 minimum requirements for the receipt of a financial assistance
 24 34 award.
 24 35    In addition to the four factors relating to the provider's
 25  1 professional staff that the EDA may consider under current
 25  2 law in deciding whether to award financial assistance, the
 25  3 division provides that the EDA may also consider the service
 25  4 model and likelihood of success of the provider, the provider's
 25  5 similarity to other successful providers in the country, and
 25  6 the provider's financial need.
 25  7    The division modifies the maximum award amount for a
 25  8 recipient.  Under current law, a grant to an entrepreneur
 25  9 assistance program cannot exceed the lesser of 25 percent of
 25 10 the funds expended by the program during the previous fiscal
 25 11 year, 100 percent of the funds raised from certain persons
 25 12 by the program during the previous fiscal year, or $200,000.
 25 13 The division provides that the amount of financial assistance
 25 14 awarded to any one provider shall not exceed $200,000.
 25 15    The division modifies the permitted use of funds received
 25 16 under the program.  Under current law, grants are only
 25 17 permitted to be used for the purpose of operating costs
 25 18 incurred by the program.  The division specifies that financial
 25 19 assistance awarded to a provider shall only be used for
 25 20 the purpose of operating costs incurred by the provider in
 25 21 the provision of business development services to emerging
 25 22 and early=stage innovation companies in Iowa.  The division
 25 23 further requires that such financial assistance shall not be
 25 24 distributed to owners or investors of the company to which the
 25 25 business development services are being provided and shall not
 25 26 be provided to other persons assisting with the provision of
 25 27 the services.
 25 28    Under current law, an entrepreneurial assistance provider is
 25 29 required to accept client referrals from the EDA as a condition
 25 30 of receiving a grant.  The division provides that the EDA may
 25 31 make client referrals to eligible providers.
 25 32    DIVISION IV ==== MISCELLANEOUS CHANGES.  Division IV makes
 25 33 several miscellaneous changes to other EDA programs.  The
 25 34 division amends the sales and use tax refund available under
 25 35 the workforce housing tax incentive program.  That refund
 26  1 is available for sales and use tax paid prior to project
 26  2 completion, which is currently defined to mean the first date
 26  3 upon which the average annualized production of finished
 26  4 product for the preceding 90=day period at the manufacturing
 26  5 facility operated by the eligible business is at least 50
 26  6 percent of the initial design capacity of the facility.  The
 26  7 division amends the definition of "project completion" to mean
 26  8 the date on which the EDA notifies the department of revenue
 26  9 that all applicable requirements of a workforce housing tax
 26 10 incentive program agreement are satisfied.  This provision
 26 11 takes effect upon enactment and applies retroactively to July
 26 12 1, 2014, for all workforce housing tax incentive agreements
 26 13 entered into on or after that date.
 26 14    The division allows the EDA to extend the project
 26 15 completion date for a project awarded tax incentives under the
 26 16 redevelopment tax credit program and the housing enterprise
 26 17 zone tax incentives program if the property that is the subject
 26 18 of the project suffered a catastrophic fire during the 2014
 26 19 calendar year.
       LSB 1212HV (3) 86
       mm/sc
 19  3 Fifth, the business must be in compliance with all agreements
 19  4 entered into under the program or other programs administered
 19  5 by the EDA.
 19  6    An eligible business seeking a tax credit is required
 19  7 to apply to the EDA during the calendar year following the
 19  8 calendar year in which the renewable chemicals are produced.
 19  9 The application must include the amount of renewable chemicals
 19 10 produced in Iowa from biomass feedstock by the eligible
 19 11 business during the calendar year, measured in pounds, and any
 19 12 other information reasonably required by the EDA in order to
 19 13 establish and verify eligibility under the program.  The EDA
 19 14 may accept applications on a continuous basis or may establish
 19 15 an annual application deadline.
 19 16    Before being issued a tax credit, an eligible business
 19 17 is required to enter into an agreement with the EDA for the
 19 18 successful completion of all requirements of the program.  The
 19 19 EDA is authorized to impose two compliance cost fees under the
 19 20 program.  The first fee equals $500 per agreement.  The second
 19 21 fee equals 0.5 percent of the value of the tax credit claimed
 19 22 pursuant to the agreement if the agreement has an aggregate tax
 19 23 credit value of $100,000 or greater.
 19 24    An eligible business that fails to comply with the
 19 25 requirements of the program or the terms of an agreement with
 19 26 the EDA may have its tax credits reduced, terminated, or
 19 27 rescinded, and may be subject to the repayment or recapture of
 19 28 claimed tax credits.
 19 29    Upon determining that all requirements of an agreement and
 19 30 the program have been fulfilled, the EDA shall issue a tax
 19 31 credit and related tax credit certificate to the eligible
 19 32 business in an amount equal to the product of $.05 multiplied
 19 33 by the number of pounds of renewable chemicals produced in Iowa
 19 34 from biomass feedstock by the eligible business during the
 19 35 calendar year.  Renewable chemicals produced by an eligible
 20  1 business prior to the effective date of the division, or
 20  2 prior to the date the business first qualifies as an eligible
 20  3 business, or after calendar year 2025, shall not qualify for
 20  4 the tax credit.
 20  5    The tax credit shall be claimed for the tax year during
 20  6 which the eligible business was issued the tax credit.  The tax
 20  7 credit may be claimed against the individual income tax and the
 20  8 corporate income tax.  The credit is refundable or may, at the
 20  9 election of the taxpayer, be carried forward for up to one tax
 20 10 year.   The tax credit shall not be transferred to any person.  A
 20 11 tax credit issued to a partnership, limited liability company,
 20 12 S corporation, cooperative organized under Code chapter 501
 20 13 and filing as a partnership for federal tax purposes, estate,
 20 14 or trust electing to have the income taxed directly to the
 20 15 individual may be claimed by the individual based upon the pro
 20 16 rata share of the individual's earnings from that entity.
 20 17    The division provides that the program is subject to the
 20 18 EDA's maximum aggregate tax credit cap of $170 million per
 20 19 fiscal year in Code section 15.119, and not more than $15
 20 20 million per fiscal year may be issued by the EDA under the
 20 21 program.  In addition, the maximum amount of tax credit that
 20 22 may be issued to an eligible business in any one calendar year
 20 23 shall not exceed $1 million or $500,000, depending on whether
 20 24 the eligible business has been operating in Iowa at the time of
 20 25 application for five or fewer years, or more than five years,
 20 26 respectively.  An eligible business shall not receive more than
 20 27 five tax credits under the program.  The EDA is required to
 20 28 issue tax credits on a first=come, first=served basis until the
 20 29 maximum amount of $15 million per fiscal year is reached.  If
 20 30 the amount of tax credits exceeds this amount in a fiscal year,
 20 31 the EDA is required to establish a wait list and give priority
 20 32 in subsequent years to the eligible businesses on the wait
 20 33 list.
 20 34    The division provides for the confidentiality of certain
 20 35 information under the program.  The identity of a tax credit
 21  1 recipient and the amount of the tax credit shall be considered
 21  2 public information under Code chapter 22 (examination of public
 21  3 records), but any other information or record in the possession
 21  4 of the EDA with respect to the program shall be presumed by
 21  5 the EDA to be a trade secret protected under Code chapter 550
 21  6 or common law and shall be kept confidential by the EDA unless
 21  7 otherwise ordered by a court.
 21  8    The division takes effect upon enactment and applies to
 21  9 renewable chemicals produced in Iowa from biomass feedstock on
 21 10 or after that date.  The division applies retroactively to tax
 21 11 years beginning on or after January 1, 2015.
 21 12    DIVISION II ==== ANGEL INVESTOR TAX CREDITS.   Division II
 21 13 makes several changes to the tax credit for investments in
 21 14 qualifying businesses and community=based seed capital funds,
 21 15 often referred to as the angel investor tax credits.  The
 21 16 division amends the purpose of the tax credit in Code section
 21 17 15E.41.  The division excludes investments in community=based
 21 18 seed capital funds from qualifying for the tax credit and
 21 19 makes several conforming amendments to remove references to
 21 20 community=based seed capital funds from the Code.
 21 21    The division modifies the amount and dollar limitation of
 21 22 the tax credit for a taxpayer.  The tax credit is increased
 21 23 from 20 percent to 25 percent of a taxpayer's equity investment
 21 24 in a qualifying business.  Under current law, a taxpayer cannot
 21 25 claim more than $50,000 of tax credit per investment in a
 21 26 qualifying business, and for each tax year a taxpayer and the
 21 27 taxpayer's affiliates cannot claim tax credits for more than
 21 28 five investments in five different qualifying businesses.  The
 21 29 division amends this dollar limitation to prohibit a natural
 21 30 person and the person's spouse, child, or sibling from claiming
 21 31 a combined amount of more than $100,000 in tax credits per tax
 21 32 year.
 21 33    The division also provides that no more than $500,000 in tax
 21 34 credits may be issued per tax year for equity investments in
 21 35 any one qualifying business.
 22  1 The division modifies the procedures for claiming the tax
 22  2 credit.  Under current law, the tax credit is not refundable
 22  3 but available for carryforward for up to five tax years.  The
 22  4 division makes the tax credit refundable for an investment
 22  5 made by a natural person, and for any other person reduces the
 22  6 carryforward period to three years.
 22  7    The division strikes a provision permitting the EDA
 22  8 to cooperate with small business development centers to
 22  9 disseminate information regarding the credits and to develop
 22 10 standard application forms, and requiring the EDA to distribute
 22 11 copies of the application forms to all community=based seed
 22 12 capital funds and potential individual investors.
 22 13    The division modifies the eligibility requirements for
 22 14 qualifying businesses.  The division strikes the requirement
 22 15 that a business have an owner that meets at least one of
 22 16 four qualifications relating to business education or
 22 17 business experience.  The division requires that a business
 22 18 be participating in an entrepreneurial assistance program,
 22 19 as defined in the division, but allows the EDA to waive this
 22 20 requirement if the business establishes that its owners,
 22 21 directors, officers, and employees have an appropriate level
 22 22 of experience such that an entrepreneurial assistance program
 22 23 would not materially change the prospects of the business.
 22 24 The EDA is allowed to consult with outside service providers
 22 25 in considering such a waiver.  The division increases from $5
 22 26 million to $10 million the maximum amount of net worth that
 22 27 a business may have to be considered a qualifying business.
 22 28 The division increases from $250,000 to $500,000 the amount of
 22 29 financing that a business must have in order to be considered a
 22 30 qualifying business, removes "near equity" from the types of
 22 31 financing that will be considered in that calculation, requires
 22 32 that the financing be secured at the time of application for
 22 33 the tax credits, and requires that the business have at least
 22 34 two investors at the time of application for the tax credits.
 22 35 These modified eligibility requirements apply to businesses
 23  1 that submit an application to the EDA to be registered as a
 23  2 qualifying business on or after the effective date of this
 23  3 division of the bill, and businesses that submitted such an
 23  4 application to the EDA before the effective date of this
 23  5 division of the bill shall be governed by current law.
 23  6    The division provides for the confidentiality of certain
 23  7 information with regard to the tax credit.  The identity of
 23  8 a qualifying business, the identity of an investor and the
 23  9 qualifying business in which the investor made an equity
 23 10 investment, and the total number and amount of tax credits
 23 11 issued shall be considered public information under Code
 23 12 chapter 22 (examination of public records), but any other
 23 13 information or record in the possession of the EDA with respect
 23 14 to the program shall be presumed by the EDA to be a trade secret
 23 15 protected under Code chapter 550 or common law and shall be
 23 16 kept confidential by the EDA unless otherwise ordered by a
 23 17 court.
 23 18    The division takes effect upon enactment and applies to
 23 19 equity investments in a qualifying business made on or after
 23 20 that date.  Equity investments in a qualifying business or
 23 21 community=based seed capital fund made prior to the effective
 23 22 date of the division shall be governed by current law.
 23 23    DIVISION III ==== ENTREPRENEUR INVESTMENT AWARDS PROGRAM.
 23 24  Division III amends the entrepreneur investment awards program
 23 25 administered by the EDA.  The division strikes provisions that
 23 26 prohibited the EDA from making awards under the program since
 23 27 July 1, 2014, and that required the EDA by December 31, 2014,
 23 28 to conduct a comprehensive review of the program and submit
 23 29 a report with specified information to the governor and the
 23 30 general assembly.
 23 31    The division modifies the purpose of the program to be
 23 32 to provide financial assistance to eligible entrepreneurial
 23 33 assistance providers (provider) that provide technical and
 23 34 financial assistance to entrepreneurs and start=up companies
 23 35 seeking to create, locate, or expand a business in Iowa.
 24  1 "Financial assistance" is defined in the division.
 24  2    The division changes the requirements for receiving an
 24  3 award.  To be eligible to receive an award under current
 24  4 law, an entrepreneurial assistance program must have been
 24  5 an Iowa=based business, expended at least $500,000 during
 24  6 the previous fiscal year to provide technical and financial
 24  7 assistance services that meet the broad=based needs of
 24  8 entrepreneurs seeking to create, locate, or expand a business
 24  9 in Iowa that intends to derive more than 10 percent of its
 24 10 gross sales from markets outside Iowa; and must have engaged
 24 11 and communicated with certain other programs, funding sources,
 24 12 and entities for its entrepreneur clients.  The division
 24 13 amends the eligibility for receiving financial assistance to
 24 14 require that a provider have its principal place of operations
 24 15 in Iowa and that the provider offer a comprehensive set of
 24 16 business development services to emerging and early=stage
 24 17 innovation companies to assist in the creation, location,
 24 18 growth, and long=term success of the company in Iowa.
 24 19 "Business development services" is defined in the division.
 24 20 Business development services may be performed at the physical
 24 21 location of the provider or the company and may be provided in
 24 22 consideration of equity participation in the company, a fee for
 24 23 services, or a membership agreement with the company.
 24 24    Under current law, the EDA board could approve, deny, or
 24 25 defer each application for a grant, and was required to award
 24 26 grants on a first=come, first=served basis.  The division
 24 27 specifies that the EDA board has the discretion to approve,
 24 28 deny, or defer each application for financial assistance and
 24 29 that the amount of financial assistance awarded to a provider
 24 30 is within the discretion of the EDA.  The division requires
 24 31 the EDA to award financial assistance on a competitive basis
 24 32 and allows the EDA to develop scoring criteria and establish
 24 33 minimum requirements for the receipt of a financial assistance
 24 34 award.
 24 35    In addition to the four factors relating to the provider's
 25  1 professional staff that the EDA may consider under current
 25  2 law in deciding whether to award financial assistance, the
 25  3 division provides that the EDA may also consider the service
 25  4 model and likelihood of success of the provider, the provider's
 25  5 similarity to other successful providers in the country, and
 25  6 the provider's financial need.
 25  7    The division modifies the maximum award amount for a
 25  8 recipient.  Under current law, a grant to an entrepreneur
 25  9 assistance program cannot exceed the lesser of 25 percent of
 25 10 the funds expended by the program during the previous fiscal
 25 11 year, 100 percent of the funds raised from certain persons
 25 12 by the program during the previous fiscal year, or $200,000.
 25 13 The division provides that the amount of financial assistance
 25 14 awarded to any one provider shall not exceed $200,000.
 25 15    The division modifies the permitted use of funds received
 25 16 under the program.  Under current law, grants are only
 25 17 permitted to be used for the purpose of operating costs
 25 18 incurred by the program.  The division specifies that financial
 25 19 assistance awarded to a provider shall only be used for
 25 20 the purpose of operating costs incurred by the provider in
 25 21 the provision of business development services to emerging
 25 22 and early=stage innovation companies in Iowa.  The division
 25 23 further requires that such financial assistance shall not be
 25 24 distributed to owners or investors of the company to which the
 25 25 business development services are being provided and shall not
 25 26 be provided to other persons assisting with the provision of
 25 27 the services.
 25 28    Under current law, an entrepreneurial assistance provider is
 25 29 required to accept client referrals from the EDA as a condition
 25 30 of receiving a grant.  The division provides that the EDA may
 25 31 make client referrals to eligible providers.
 25 32    DIVISION IV ==== MISCELLANEOUS CHANGES.  Division IV makes
 25 33 several miscellaneous changes to other EDA programs.  The
 25 34 division amends the sales and use tax refund available under
 25 35 the workforce housing tax incentive program.  That refund
 26  1 is available for sales and use tax paid prior to project
 26  2 completion, which is currently defined to mean the first date
 26  3 upon which the average annualized production of finished
 26  4 product for the preceding 90=day period at the manufacturing
 26  5 facility operated by the eligible business is at least 50
 26  6 percent of the initial design capacity of the facility.  The
 26  7 division amends the definition of "project completion" to mean
 26  8 the date on which the EDA notifies the department of revenue
 26  9 that all applicable requirements of a workforce housing tax
 26 10 incentive program agreement are satisfied.  This provision
 26 11 takes effect upon enactment and applies retroactively to July
 26 12 1, 2014, for all workforce housing tax incentive agreements
 26 13 entered into on or after that date.
 26 14    The division allows the EDA to extend the project
 26 15 completion date for a project awarded tax incentives under the
 26 16 redevelopment tax credit program and the housing enterprise
 26 17 zone tax incentives program if the property that is the subject
 26 18 of the project suffered a catastrophic fire during the 2014
 26 19 calendar year.
       LSB 1212HV (3) 86
       mm/sc
 19  4 entered into under the program or other programs administered
 19  5 by the EDA.
 19  6    An eligible business seeking a tax credit is required
 19  7 to apply to the EDA during the calendar year following the
 19  8 calendar year in which the renewable chemicals are produced.
 19  9 The application must include the amount of renewable chemicals
 19 10 produced in Iowa from biomass feedstock by the eligible
 19 11 business during the calendar year, measured in pounds, and any
 19 12 other information reasonably required by the EDA in order to
 19 13 establish and verify eligibility under the program.  The EDA
 19 14 may accept applications on a continuous basis or may establish
 19 15 an annual application deadline.
 19 16    Before being issued a tax credit, an eligible business
 19 17 is required to enter into an agreement with the EDA for the
 19 18 successful completion of all requirements of the program.  The
 19 19 EDA is authorized to impose two compliance cost fees under the
 19 20 program.  The first fee equals $500 per agreement.  The second
 19 21 fee equals 0.5 percent of the value of the tax credit claimed
 19 22 pursuant to the agreement if the agreement has an aggregate tax
 19 23 credit value of $100,000 or greater.
 19 24    An eligible business that fails to comply with the
 19 25 requirements of the program or the terms of an agreement with
 19 26 the EDA may have its tax credits reduced, terminated, or
 19 27 rescinded, and may be subject to the repayment or recapture of
 19 28 claimed tax credits.
 19 29    Upon determining that all requirements of an agreement and
 19 30 the program have been fulfilled, the EDA shall issue a tax
 19 31 credit and related tax credit certificate to the eligible
 19 32 business in an amount equal to the product of $.05 multiplied
 19 33 by the number of pounds of renewable chemicals produced in Iowa
 19 34 from biomass feedstock by the eligible business during the
 19 35 calendar year.  Renewable chemicals produced by an eligible
 20  1 business prior to the effective date of the division, or
 20  2 prior to the date the business first qualifies as an eligible
 20  3 business, or after calendar year 2025, shall not qualify for
 20  4 the tax credit.
 20  5    The tax credit shall be claimed for the tax year during
 20  6 which the eligible business was issued the tax credit.  The tax
 20  7 credit may be claimed against the individual income tax and the
 20  8 corporate income tax.  The credit is refundable or may, at the
 20  9 election of the taxpayer, be carried forward for up to one tax
 20 10 year.   The tax credit shall not be transferred to any person.  A
 20 11 tax credit issued to a partnership, limited liability company,
 20 12 S corporation, cooperative organized under Code chapter 501
 20 13 and filing as a partnership for federal tax purposes, estate,
 20 14 or trust electing to have the income taxed directly to the
 20 15 individual may be claimed by the individual based upon the pro
 20 16 rata share of the individual's earnings from that entity.
 20 17    The division provides that the program is subject to the
 20 18 EDA's maximum aggregate tax credit cap of $170 million per
 20 19 fiscal year in Code section 15.119, and not more than $15
 20 20 million per fiscal year may be issued by the EDA under the
 20 21 program.  In addition, the maximum amount of tax credit that
 20 22 may be issued to an eligible business in any one calendar year
 20 23 shall not exceed $1 million or $500,000, depending on whether
 20 24 the eligible business has been operating in Iowa at the time of
 20 25 application for five or fewer years, or more than five years,
 20 26 respectively.  An eligible business shall not receive more than
 20 27 five tax credits under the program.  The EDA is required to
 20 28 issue tax credits on a first=come, first=served basis until the
 20 29 maximum amount of $15 million per fiscal year is reached.  If
 20 30 the amount of tax credits exceeds this amount in a fiscal year,
 20 31 the EDA is required to establish a wait list and give priority
 20 32 in subsequent years to the eligible businesses on the wait
 20 33 list.
 20 34    The division provides for the confidentiality of certain
 20 35 information under the program.  The identity of a tax credit
 21  1 recipient and the amount of the tax credit shall be considered
 21  2 public information under Code chapter 22 (examination of public
 21  3 records), but any other information or record in the possession
 21  4 of the EDA with respect to the program shall be presumed by
 21  5 the EDA to be a trade secret protected under Code chapter 550
 21  6 or common law and shall be kept confidential by the EDA unless
 21  7 otherwise ordered by a court.
 21  8    The division takes effect upon enactment and applies to
 21  9 renewable chemicals produced in Iowa from biomass feedstock on
 21 10 or after that date.  The division applies retroactively to tax
 21 11 years beginning on or after January 1, 2015.
 21 12    DIVISION II ==== ANGEL INVESTOR TAX CREDITS.   Division II
 21 13 makes several changes to the tax credit for investments in
 21 14 qualifying businesses and community=based seed capital funds,
 21 15 often referred to as the angel investor tax credits.  The
 21 16 division amends the purpose of the tax credit in Code section
 21 17 15E.41.  The division excludes investments in community=based
 21 18 seed capital funds from qualifying for the tax credit and
 21 19 makes several conforming amendments to remove references to
 21 20 community=based seed capital funds from the Code.
 21 21    The division modifies the amount and dollar limitation of
 21 22 the tax credit for a taxpayer.  The tax credit is increased
 21 23 from 20 percent to 25 percent of a taxpayer's equity investment
 21 24 in a qualifying business.  Under current law, a taxpayer cannot
 21 25 claim more than $50,000 of tax credit per investment in a
 21 26 qualifying business, and for each tax year a taxpayer and the
 21 27 taxpayer's affiliates cannot claim tax credits for more than
 21 28 five investments in five different qualifying businesses.  The
 21 29 division amends this dollar limitation to prohibit a natural
 21 30 person and the person's spouse, child, or sibling from claiming
 21 31 a combined amount of more than $100,000 in tax credits per tax
 21 32 year.
 21 33    The division also provides that no more than $500,000 in tax
 21 34 credits may be issued per tax year for equity investments in
 21 35 any one qualifying business.
 22  1 The division modifies the procedures for claiming the tax
 22  2 credit.  Under current law, the tax credit is not refundable
 22  3 but available for carryforward for up to five tax years.  The
 22  4 division makes the tax credit refundable for an investment
 22  5 made by a natural person, and for any other person reduces the
 22  6 carryforward period to three years.
 22  7    The division strikes a provision permitting the EDA
 22  8 to cooperate with small business development centers to
 22  9 disseminate information regarding the credits and to develop
 22 10 standard application forms, and requiring the EDA to distribute
 22 11 copies of the application forms to all community=based seed
 22 12 capital funds and potential individual investors.
 22 13    The division modifies the eligibility requirements for
 22 14 qualifying businesses.  The division strikes the requirement
 22 15 that a business have an owner that meets at least one of
 22 16 four qualifications relating to business education or
 22 17 business experience.  The division requires that a business
 22 18 be participating in an entrepreneurial assistance program,
 22 19 as defined in the division, but allows the EDA to waive this
 22 20 requirement if the business establishes that its owners,
 22 21 directors, officers, and employees have an appropriate level
 22 22 of experience such that an entrepreneurial assistance program
 22 23 would not materially change the prospects of the business.
 22 24 The EDA is allowed to consult with outside service providers
 22 25 in considering such a waiver.  The division increases from $5
 22 26 million to $10 million the maximum amount of net worth that
 22 27 a business may have to be considered a qualifying business.
 22 28 The division increases from $250,000 to $500,000 the amount of
 22 29 financing that a business must have in order to be considered a
 22 30 qualifying business, removes "near equity" from the types of
 22 31 financing that will be considered in that calculation, requires
 22 32 that the financing be secured at the time of application for
 22 33 the tax credits, and requires that the business have at least
 22 34 two investors at the time of application for the tax credits.
 22 35 These modified eligibility requirements apply to businesses
 23  1 that submit an application to the EDA to be registered as a
 23  2 qualifying business on or after the effective date of this
 23  3 division of the bill, and businesses that submitted such an
 23  4 application to the EDA before the effective date of this
 23  5 division of the bill shall be governed by current law.
 23  6    The division provides for the confidentiality of certain
 23  7 information with regard to the tax credit.  The identity of
 23  8 a qualifying business, the identity of an investor and the
 23  9 qualifying business in which the investor made an equity
 23 10 investment, and the total number and amount of tax credits
 23 11 issued shall be considered public information under Code
 23 12 chapter 22 (examination of public records), but any other
 23 13 information or record in the possession of the EDA with respect
 23 14 to the program shall be presumed by the EDA to be a trade secret
 23 15 protected under Code chapter 550 or common law and shall be
 23 16 kept confidential by the EDA unless otherwise ordered by a
 23 17 court.
 23 18    The division takes effect upon enactment and applies to
 23 19 equity investments in a qualifying business made on or after
 23 20 that date.  Equity investments in a qualifying business or
 23 21 community=based seed capital fund made prior to the effective
 23 22 date of the division shall be governed by current law.
 23 23    DIVISION III ==== ENTREPRENEUR INVESTMENT AWARDS PROGRAM.
 23 24  Division III amends the entrepreneur investment awards program
 23 25 administered by the EDA.  The division strikes provisions that
 23 26 prohibited the EDA from making awards under the program since
 23 27 July 1, 2014, and that required the EDA by December 31, 2014,
 23 28 to conduct a comprehensive review of the program and submit
 23 29 a report with specified information to the governor and the
 23 30 general assembly.
 23 31    The division modifies the purpose of the program to be
 23 32 to provide financial assistance to eligible entrepreneurial
 23 33 assistance providers (provider) that provide technical and
 23 34 financial assistance to entrepreneurs and start=up companies
 23 35 seeking to create, locate, or expand a business in Iowa.
 24  1 "Financial assistance" is defined in the division.
 24  2    The division changes the requirements for receiving an
 24  3 award.  To be eligible to receive an award under current
 24  4 law, an entrepreneurial assistance program must have been
 24  5 an Iowa=based business, expended at least $500,000 during
 24  6 the previous fiscal year to provide technical and financial
 24  7 assistance services that meet the broad=based needs of
 24  8 entrepreneurs seeking to create, locate, or expand a business
 24  9 in Iowa that intends to derive more than 10 percent of its
 24 10 gross sales from markets outside Iowa; and must have engaged
 24 11 and communicated with certain other programs, funding sources,
 24 12 and entities for its entrepreneur clients.  The division
 24 13 amends the eligibility for receiving financial assistance to
 24 14 require that a provider have its principal place of operations
 24 15 in Iowa and that the provider offer a comprehensive set of
 24 16 business development services to emerging and early=stage
 24 17 innovation companies to assist in the creation, location,
 24 18 growth, and long=term success of the company in Iowa.
 24 19 "Business development services" is defined in the division.
 24 20 Business development services may be performed at the physical
 24 21 location of the provider or the company and may be provided in
 24 22 consideration of equity participation in the company, a fee for
 24 23 services, or a membership agreement with the company.
 24 24    Under current law, the EDA board could approve, deny, or
 24 25 defer each application for a grant, and was required to award
 24 26 grants on a first=come, first=served basis.  The division
 24 27 specifies that the EDA board has the discretion to approve,
 24 28 deny, or defer each application for financial assistance and
 24 29 that the amount of financial assistance awarded to a provider
 24 30 is within the discretion of the EDA.  The division requires
 24 31 the EDA to award financial assistance on a competitive basis
 24 32 and allows the EDA to develop scoring criteria and establish
 24 33 minimum requirements for the receipt of a financial assistance
 24 34 award.
 24 35    In addition to the four factors relating to the provider's
 25  1 professional staff that the EDA may consider under current
 25  2 law in deciding whether to award financial assistance, the
 25  3 division provides that the EDA may also consider the service
 25  4 model and likelihood of success of the provider, the provider's
 25  5 similarity to other successful providers in the country, and
 25  6 the provider's financial need.
 25  7    The division modifies the maximum award amount for a
 25  8 recipient.  Under current law, a grant to an entrepreneur
 25  9 assistance program cannot exceed the lesser of 25 percent of
 25 10 the funds expended by the program during the previous fiscal
 25 11 year, 100 percent of the funds raised from certain persons
 25 12 by the program during the previous fiscal year, or $200,000.
 25 13 The division provides that the amount of financial assistance
 25 14 awarded to any one provider shall not exceed $200,000.
 25 15    The division modifies the permitted use of funds received
 25 16 under the program.  Under current law, grants are only
 25 17 permitted to be used for the purpose of operating costs
 25 18 incurred by the program.  The division specifies that financial
 25 19 assistance awarded to a provider shall only be used for
 25 20 the purpose of operating costs incurred by the provider in
 25 21 the provision of business development services to emerging
 25 22 and early=stage innovation companies in Iowa.  The division
 25 23 further requires that such financial assistance shall not be
 25 24 distributed to owners or investors of the company to which the
 25 25 business development services are being provided and shall not
 25 26 be provided to other persons assisting with the provision of
 25 27 the services.
 25 28    Under current law, an entrepreneurial assistance provider is
 25 29 required to accept client referrals from the EDA as a condition
 25 30 of receiving a grant.  The division provides that the EDA may
 25 31 make client referrals to eligible providers.
 25 32    DIVISION IV ==== MISCELLANEOUS CHANGES.  Division IV makes
 25 33 several miscellaneous changes to other EDA programs.  The
 25 34 division amends the sales and use tax refund available under
 25 35 the workforce housing tax incentive program.  That refund
 26  1 is available for sales and use tax paid prior to project
 26  2 completion, which is currently defined to mean the first date
 26  3 upon which the average annualized production of finished
 26  4 product for the preceding 90=day period at the manufacturing
 26  5 facility operated by the eligible business is at least 50
 26  6 percent of the initial design capacity of the facility.  The
 26  7 division amends the definition of "project completion" to mean
 26  8 the date on which the EDA notifies the department of revenue
 26  9 that all applicable requirements of a workforce housing tax
 26 10 incentive program agreement are satisfied.  This provision
 26 11 takes effect upon enactment and applies retroactively to July
 26 12 1, 2014, for all workforce housing tax incentive agreements
 26 13 entered into on or after that date.
 26 14    The division allows the EDA to extend the project
 26 15 completion date for a project awarded tax incentives under the
 26 16 redevelopment tax credit program and the housing enterprise
 26 17 zone tax incentives program if the property that is the subject
 26 18 of the project suffered a catastrophic fire during the 2014
 26 19 calendar year.

 19  5 by the EDA.
 19  6    An eligible business seeking a tax credit is required
 19  7 to apply to the EDA during the calendar year following the
 19  8 calendar year in which the renewable chemicals are produced.
 19  9 The application must include the amount of renewable chemicals
 19 10 produced in Iowa from biomass feedstock by the eligible
 19 11 business during the calendar year, measured in pounds, and any
 19 12 other information reasonably required by the EDA in order to
 19 13 establish and verify eligibility under the program.  The EDA
 19 14 may accept applications on a continuous basis or may establish
 19 15 an annual application deadline.
 19 16    Before being issued a tax credit, an eligible business
 19 17 is required to enter into an agreement with the EDA for the
 19 18 successful completion of all requirements of the program.  The
 19 19 EDA is authorized to impose two compliance cost fees under the
 19 20 program.  The first fee equals $500 per agreement.  The second
 19 21 fee equals 0.5 percent of the value of the tax credit claimed
 19 22 pursuant to the agreement if the agreement has an aggregate tax
 19 23 credit value of $100,000 or greater.
 19 24    An eligible business that fails to comply with the
 19 25 requirements of the program or the terms of an agreement with
 19 26 the EDA may have its tax credits reduced, terminated, or
 19 27 rescinded, and may be subject to the repayment or recapture of
 19 28 claimed tax credits.
 19 29    Upon determining that all requirements of an agreement and
 19 30 the program have been fulfilled, the EDA shall issue a tax
 19 31 credit and related tax credit certificate to the eligible
 19 32 business in an amount equal to the product of $.05 multiplied
 19 33 by the number of pounds of renewable chemicals produced in Iowa
 19 34 from biomass feedstock by the eligible business during the
 19 35 calendar year.  Renewable chemicals produced by an eligible
 20  1 business prior to the effective date of the division, or
 20  2 prior to the date the business first qualifies as an eligible
 20  3 business, or after calendar year 2025, shall not qualify for
 20  4 the tax credit.
 20  5    The tax credit shall be claimed for the tax year during
 20  6 which the eligible business was issued the tax credit.  The tax
 20  7 credit may be claimed against the individual income tax and the
 20  8 corporate income tax.  The credit is refundable or may, at the
 20  9 election of the taxpayer, be carried forward for up to one tax
 20 10 year.   The tax credit shall not be transferred to any person.  A
 20 11 tax credit issued to a partnership, limited liability company,
 20 12 S corporation, cooperative organized under Code chapter 501
 20 13 and filing as a partnership for federal tax purposes, estate,
 20 14 or trust electing to have the income taxed directly to the
 20 15 individual may be claimed by the individual based upon the pro
 20 16 rata share of the individual's earnings from that entity.
 20 17    The division provides that the program is subject to the
 20 18 EDA's maximum aggregate tax credit cap of $170 million per
 20 19 fiscal year in Code section 15.119, and not more than $15
 20 20 million per fiscal year may be issued by the EDA under the
 20 21 program.  In addition, the maximum amount of tax credit that
 20 22 may be issued to an eligible business in any one calendar year
 20 23 shall not exceed $1 million or $500,000, depending on whether
 20 24 the eligible business has been operating in Iowa at the time of
 20 25 application for five or fewer years, or more than five years,
 20 26 respectively.  An eligible business shall not receive more than
 20 27 five tax credits under the program.  The EDA is required to
 20 28 issue tax credits on a first=come, first=served basis until the
 20 29 maximum amount of $15 million per fiscal year is reached.  If
 20 30 the amount of tax credits exceeds this amount in a fiscal year,
 20 31 the EDA is required to establish a wait list and give priority
 20 32 in subsequent years to the eligible businesses on the wait
 20 33 list.
 20 34    The division provides for the confidentiality of certain
 20 35 information under the program.  The identity of a tax credit
 21  1 recipient and the amount of the tax credit shall be considered
 21  2 public information under Code chapter 22 (examination of public
 21  3 records), but any other information or record in the possession
 21  4 of the EDA with respect to the program shall be presumed by
 21  5 the EDA to be a trade secret protected under Code chapter 550
 21  6 or common law and shall be kept confidential by the EDA unless
 21  7 otherwise ordered by a court.
 21  8    The division takes effect upon enactment and applies to
 21  9 renewable chemicals produced in Iowa from biomass feedstock on
 21 10 or after that date.  The division applies retroactively to tax
 21 11 years beginning on or after January 1, 2015.
 21 12    DIVISION II ==== ANGEL INVESTOR TAX CREDITS.   Division II
 21 13 makes several changes to the tax credit for investments in
 21 14 qualifying businesses and community=based seed capital funds,
 21 15 often referred to as the angel investor tax credits.  The
 21 16 division amends the purpose of the tax credit in Code section
 21 17 15E.41.  The division excludes investments in community=based
 21 18 seed capital funds from qualifying for the tax credit and
 21 19 makes several conforming amendments to remove references to
 21 20 community=based seed capital funds from the Code.
 21 21    The division modifies the amount and dollar limitation of
 21 22 the tax credit for a taxpayer.  The tax credit is increased
 21 23 from 20 percent to 25 percent of a taxpayer's equity investment
 21 24 in a qualifying business.  Under current law, a taxpayer cannot
 21 25 claim more than $50,000 of tax credit per investment in a
 21 26 qualifying business, and for each tax year a taxpayer and the
 21 27 taxpayer's affiliates cannot claim tax credits for more than
 21 28 five investments in five different qualifying businesses.  The
 21 29 division amends this dollar limitation to prohibit a natural
 21 30 person and the person's spouse, child, or sibling from claiming
 21 31 a combined amount of more than $100,000 in tax credits per tax
 21 32 year.
 21 33    The division also provides that no more than $500,000 in tax
 21 34 credits may be issued per tax year for equity investments in
 21 35 any one qualifying business.
 22  1 The division modifies the procedures for claiming the tax
 22  2 credit.  Under current law, the tax credit is not refundable
 22  3 but available for carryforward for up to five tax years.  The
 22  4 division makes the tax credit refundable for an investment
 22  5 made by a natural person, and for any other person reduces the
 22  6 carryforward period to three years.
 22  7    The division strikes a provision permitting the EDA
 22  8 to cooperate with small business development centers to
 22  9 disseminate information regarding the credits and to develop
 22 10 standard application forms, and requiring the EDA to distribute
 22 11 copies of the application forms to all community=based seed
 22 12 capital funds and potential individual investors.
 22 13    The division modifies the eligibility requirements for
 22 14 qualifying businesses.  The division strikes the requirement
 22 15 that a business have an owner that meets at least one of
 22 16 four qualifications relating to business education or
 22 17 business experience.  The division requires that a business
 22 18 be participating in an entrepreneurial assistance program,
 22 19 as defined in the division, but allows the EDA to waive this
 22 20 requirement if the business establishes that its owners,
 22 21 directors, officers, and employees have an appropriate level
 22 22 of experience such that an entrepreneurial assistance program
 22 23 would not materially change the prospects of the business.
 22 24 The EDA is allowed to consult with outside service providers
 22 25 in considering such a waiver.  The division increases from $5
 22 26 million to $10 million the maximum amount of net worth that
 22 27 a business may have to be considered a qualifying business.
 22 28 The division increases from $250,000 to $500,000 the amount of
 22 29 financing that a business must have in order to be considered a
 22 30 qualifying business, removes "near equity" from the types of
 22 31 financing that will be considered in that calculation, requires
 22 32 that the financing be secured at the time of application for
 22 33 the tax credits, and requires that the business have at least
 22 34 two investors at the time of application for the tax credits.
 22 35 These modified eligibility requirements apply to businesses
 23  1 that submit an application to the EDA to be registered as a
 23  2 qualifying business on or after the effective date of this
 23  3 division of the bill, and businesses that submitted such an
 23  4 application to the EDA before the effective date of this
 23  5 division of the bill shall be governed by current law.
 23  6    The division provides for the confidentiality of certain
 23  7 information with regard to the tax credit.  The identity of
 23  8 a qualifying business, the identity of an investor and the
 23  9 qualifying business in which the investor made an equity
 23 10 investment, and the total number and amount of tax credits
 23 11 issued shall be considered public information under Code
 23 12 chapter 22 (examination of public records), but any other
 23 13 information or record in the possession of the EDA with respect
 23 14 to the program shall be presumed by the EDA to be a trade secret
 23 15 protected under Code chapter 550 or common law and shall be
 23 16 kept confidential by the EDA unless otherwise ordered by a
 23 17 court.
 23 18    The division takes effect upon enactment and applies to
 23 19 equity investments in a qualifying business made on or after
 23 20 that date.  Equity investments in a qualifying business or
 23 21 community=based seed capital fund made prior to the effective
 23 22 date of the division shall be governed by current law.
 23 23    DIVISION III ==== ENTREPRENEUR INVESTMENT AWARDS PROGRAM.
 23 24  Division III amends the entrepreneur investment awards program
 23 25 administered by the EDA.  The division strikes provisions that
 23 26 prohibited the EDA from making awards under the program since
 23 27 July 1, 2014, and that required the EDA by December 31, 2014,
 23 28 to conduct a comprehensive review of the program and submit
 23 29 a report with specified information to the governor and the
 23 30 general assembly.
 23 31    The division modifies the purpose of the program to be
 23 32 to provide financial assistance to eligible entrepreneurial
 23 33 assistance providers (provider) that provide technical and
 23 34 financial assistance to entrepreneurs and start=up companies
 23 35 seeking to create, locate, or expand a business in Iowa.
 24  1 "Financial assistance" is defined in the division.
 24  2    The division changes the requirements for receiving an
 24  3 award.  To be eligible to receive an award under current
 24  4 law, an entrepreneurial assistance program must have been
 24  5 an Iowa=based business, expended at least $500,000 during
 24  6 the previous fiscal year to provide technical and financial
 24  7 assistance services that meet the broad=based needs of
 24  8 entrepreneurs seeking to create, locate, or expand a business
 24  9 in Iowa that intends to derive more than 10 percent of its
 24 10 gross sales from markets outside Iowa; and must have engaged
 24 11 and communicated with certain other programs, funding sources,
 24 12 and entities for its entrepreneur clients.  The division
 24 13 amends the eligibility for receiving financial assistance to
 24 14 require that a provider have its principal place of operations
 24 15 in Iowa and that the provider offer a comprehensive set of
 24 16 business development services to emerging and early=stage
 24 17 innovation companies to assist in the creation, location,
 24 18 growth, and long=term success of the company in Iowa.
 24 19 "Business development services" is defined in the division.
 24 20 Business development services may be performed at the physical
 24 21 location of the provider or the company and may be provided in
 24 22 consideration of equity participation in the company, a fee for
 24 23 services, or a membership agreement with the company.
 24 24    Under current law, the EDA board could approve, deny, or
 24 25 defer each application for a grant, and was required to award
 24 26 grants on a first=come, first=served basis.  The division
 24 27 specifies that the EDA board has the discretion to approve,
 24 28 deny, or defer each application for financial assistance and
 24 29 that the amount of financial assistance awarded to a provider
 24 30 is within the discretion of the EDA.  The division requires
 24 31 the EDA to award financial assistance on a competitive basis
 24 32 and allows the EDA to develop scoring criteria and establish
 24 33 minimum requirements for the receipt of a financial assistance
 24 34 award.
 24 35    In addition to the four factors relating to the provider's
 25  1 professional staff that the EDA may consider under current
 25  2 law in deciding whether to award financial assistance, the
 25  3 division provides that the EDA may also consider the service
 25  4 model and likelihood of success of the provider, the provider's
 25  5 similarity to other successful providers in the country, and
 25  6 the provider's financial need.
 25  7    The division modifies the maximum award amount for a
 25  8 recipient.  Under current law, a grant to an entrepreneur
 25  9 assistance program cannot exceed the lesser of 25 percent of
 25 10 the funds expended by the program during the previous fiscal
 25 11 year, 100 percent of the funds raised from certain persons
 25 12 by the program during the previous fiscal year, or $200,000.
 25 13 The division provides that the amount of financial assistance
 25 14 awarded to any one provider shall not exceed $200,000.
 25 15    The division modifies the permitted use of funds received
 25 16 under the program.  Under current law, grants are only
 25 17 permitted to be used for the purpose of operating costs
 25 18 incurred by the program.  The division specifies that financial
 25 19 assistance awarded to a provider shall only be used for
 25 20 the purpose of operating costs incurred by the provider in
 25 21 the provision of business development services to emerging
 25 22 and early=stage innovation companies in Iowa.  The division
 25 23 further requires that such financial assistance shall not be
 25 24 distributed to owners or investors of the company to which the
 25 25 business development services are being provided and shall not
 25 26 be provided to other persons assisting with the provision of
 25 27 the services.
 25 28    Under current law, an entrepreneurial assistance provider is
 25 29 required to accept client referrals from the EDA as a condition
 25 30 of receiving a grant.  The division provides that the EDA may
 25 31 make client referrals to eligible providers.
 25 32    DIVISION IV ==== MISCELLANEOUS CHANGES.  Division IV makes
 25 33 several miscellaneous changes to other EDA programs.  The
 25 34 division amends the sales and use tax refund available under
 25 35 the workforce housing tax incentive program.  That refund
 26  1 is available for sales and use tax paid prior to project
 26  2 completion, which is currently defined to mean the first date
 26  3 upon which the average annualized production of finished
 26  4 product for the preceding 90=day period at the manufacturing
 26  5 facility operated by the eligible business is at least 50
 26  6 percent of the initial design capacity of the facility.  The
 26  7 division amends the definition of "project completion" to mean
 26  8 the date on which the EDA notifies the department of revenue
 26  9 that all applicable requirements of a workforce housing tax
 26 10 incentive program agreement are satisfied.  This provision
 26 11 takes effect upon enactment and applies retroactively to July
 26 12 1, 2014, for all workforce housing tax incentive agreements
 26 13 entered into on or after that date.
 26 14    The division allows the EDA to extend the project
 26 15 completion date for a project awarded tax incentives under the
 26 16 redevelopment tax credit program and the housing enterprise
 26 17 zone tax incentives program if the property that is the subject
 26 18 of the project suffered a catastrophic fire during the 2014
 26 19 calendar year.
       LSB 1212HV (3) 86
       mm/sc
 19  6    An eligible business seeking a tax credit is required
 19  7 to apply to the EDA during the calendar year following the
 19  8 calendar year in which the renewable chemicals are produced.
 19  9 The application must include the amount of renewable chemicals
 19 10 produced in Iowa from biomass feedstock by the eligible
 19 11 business during the calendar year, measured in pounds, and any
 19 12 other information reasonably required by the EDA in order to
 19 13 establish and verify eligibility under the program.  The EDA
 19 14 may accept applications on a continuous basis or may establish
 19 15 an annual application deadline.
 19 16    Before being issued a tax credit, an eligible business
 19 17 is required to enter into an agreement with the EDA for the
 19 18 successful completion of all requirements of the program.  The
 19 19 EDA is authorized to impose two compliance cost fees under the
 19 20 program.  The first fee equals $500 per agreement.  The second
 19 21 fee equals 0.5 percent of the value of the tax credit claimed
 19 22 pursuant to the agreement if the agreement has an aggregate tax
 19 23 credit value of $100,000 or greater.
 19 24    An eligible business that fails to comply with the
 19 25 requirements of the program or the terms of an agreement with
 19 26 the EDA may have its tax credits reduced, terminated, or
 19 27 rescinded, and may be subject to the repayment or recapture of
 19 28 claimed tax credits.
 19 29    Upon determining that all requirements of an agreement and
 19 30 the program have been fulfilled, the EDA shall issue a tax
 19 31 credit and related tax credit certificate to the eligible
 19 32 business in an amount equal to the product of $.05 multiplied
 19 33 by the number of pounds of renewable chemicals produced in Iowa
 19 34 from biomass feedstock by the eligible business during the
 19 35 calendar year.  Renewable chemicals produced by an eligible
 20  1 business prior to the effective date of the division, or
 20  2 prior to the date the business first qualifies as an eligible
 20  3 business, or after calendar year 2025, shall not qualify for
 20  4 the tax credit.
 20  5    The tax credit shall be claimed for the tax year during
 20  6 which the eligible business was issued the tax credit.  The tax
 20  7 credit may be claimed against the individual income tax and the
 20  8 corporate income tax.  The credit is refundable or may, at the
 20  9 election of the taxpayer, be carried forward for up to one tax
 20 10 year.   The tax credit shall not be transferred to any person.  A
 20 11 tax credit issued to a partnership, limited liability company,
 20 12 S corporation, cooperative organized under Code chapter 501
 20 13 and filing as a partnership for federal tax purposes, estate,
 20 14 or trust electing to have the income taxed directly to the
 20 15 individual may be claimed by the individual based upon the pro
 20 16 rata share of the individual's earnings from that entity.
 20 17    The division provides that the program is subject to the
 20 18 EDA's maximum aggregate tax credit cap of $170 million per
 20 19 fiscal year in Code section 15.119, and not more than $15
 20 20 million per fiscal year may be issued by the EDA under the
 20 21 program.  In addition, the maximum amount of tax credit that
 20 22 may be issued to an eligible business in any one calendar year
 20 23 shall not exceed $1 million or $500,000, depending on whether
 20 24 the eligible business has been operating in Iowa at the time of
 20 25 application for five or fewer years, or more than five years,
 20 26 respectively.  An eligible business shall not receive more than
 20 27 five tax credits under the program.  The EDA is required to
 20 28 issue tax credits on a first=come, first=served basis until the
 20 29 maximum amount of $15 million per fiscal year is reached.  If
 20 30 the amount of tax credits exceeds this amount in a fiscal year,
 20 31 the EDA is required to establish a wait list and give priority
 20 32 in subsequent years to the eligible businesses on the wait
 20 33 list.
 20 34    The division provides for the confidentiality of certain
 20 35 information under the program.  The identity of a tax credit
 21  1 recipient and the amount of the tax credit shall be considered
 21  2 public information under Code chapter 22 (examination of public
 21  3 records), but any other information or record in the possession
 21  4 of the EDA with respect to the program shall be presumed by
 21  5 the EDA to be a trade secret protected under Code chapter 550
 21  6 or common law and shall be kept confidential by the EDA unless
 21  7 otherwise ordered by a court.
 21  8    The division takes effect upon enactment and applies to
 21  9 renewable chemicals produced in Iowa from biomass feedstock on
 21 10 or after that date.  The division applies retroactively to tax
 21 11 years beginning on or after January 1, 2015.
 21 12    DIVISION II ==== ANGEL INVESTOR TAX CREDITS.   Division II
 21 13 makes several changes to the tax credit for investments in
 21 14 qualifying businesses and community=based seed capital funds,
 21 15 often referred to as the angel investor tax credits.  The
 21 16 division amends the purpose of the tax credit in Code section
 21 17 15E.41.  The division excludes investments in community=based
 21 18 seed capital funds from qualifying for the tax credit and
 21 19 makes several conforming amendments to remove references to
 21 20 community=based seed capital funds from the Code.
 21 21    The division modifies the amount and dollar limitation of
 21 22 the tax credit for a taxpayer.  The tax credit is increased
 21 23 from 20 percent to 25 percent of a taxpayer's equity investment
 21 24 in a qualifying business.  Under current law, a taxpayer cannot
 21 25 claim more than $50,000 of tax credit per investment in a
 21 26 qualifying business, and for each tax year a taxpayer and the
 21 27 taxpayer's affiliates cannot claim tax credits for more than
 21 28 five investments in five different qualifying businesses.  The
 21 29 division amends this dollar limitation to prohibit a natural
 21 30 person and the person's spouse, child, or sibling from claiming
 21 31 a combined amount of more than $100,000 in tax credits per tax
 21 32 year.
 21 33    The division also provides that no more than $500,000 in tax
 21 34 credits may be issued per tax year for equity investments in
 21 35 any one qualifying business.
 22  1 The division modifies the procedures for claiming the tax
 22  2 credit.  Under current law, the tax credit is not refundable
 22  3 but available for carryforward for up to five tax years.  The
 22  4 division makes the tax credit refundable for an investment
 22  5 made by a natural person, and for any other person reduces the
 22  6 carryforward period to three years.
 22  7    The division strikes a provision permitting the EDA
 22  8 to cooperate with small business development centers to
 22  9 disseminate information regarding the credits and to develop
 22 10 standard application forms, and requiring the EDA to distribute
 22 11 copies of the application forms to all community=based seed
 22 12 capital funds and potential individual investors.
 22 13    The division modifies the eligibility requirements for
 22 14 qualifying businesses.  The division strikes the requirement
 22 15 that a business have an owner that meets at least one of
 22 16 four qualifications relating to business education or
 22 17 business experience.  The division requires that a business
 22 18 be participating in an entrepreneurial assistance program,
 22 19 as defined in the division, but allows the EDA to waive this
 22 20 requirement if the business establishes that its owners,
 22 21 directors, officers, and employees have an appropriate level
 22 22 of experience such that an entrepreneurial assistance program
 22 23 would not materially change the prospects of the business.
 22 24 The EDA is allowed to consult with outside service providers
 22 25 in considering such a waiver.  The division increases from $5
 22 26 million to $10 million the maximum amount of net worth that
 22 27 a business may have to be considered a qualifying business.
 22 28 The division increases from $250,000 to $500,000 the amount of
 22 29 financing that a business must have in order to be considered a
 22 30 qualifying business, removes "near equity" from the types of
 22 31 financing that will be considered in that calculation, requires
 22 32 that the financing be secured at the time of application for
 22 33 the tax credits, and requires that the business have at least
 22 34 two investors at the time of application for the tax credits.
 22 35 These modified eligibility requirements apply to businesses
 23  1 that submit an application to the EDA to be registered as a
 23  2 qualifying business on or after the effective date of this
 23  3 division of the bill, and businesses that submitted such an
 23  4 application to the EDA before the effective date of this
 23  5 division of the bill shall be governed by current law.
 23  6    The division provides for the confidentiality of certain
 23  7 information with regard to the tax credit.  The identity of
 23  8 a qualifying business, the identity of an investor and the
 23  9 qualifying business in which the investor made an equity
 23 10 investment, and the total number and amount of tax credits
 23 11 issued shall be considered public information under Code
 23 12 chapter 22 (examination of public records), but any other
 23 13 information or record in the possession of the EDA with respect
 23 14 to the program shall be presumed by the EDA to be a trade secret
 23 15 protected under Code chapter 550 or common law and shall be
 23 16 kept confidential by the EDA unless otherwise ordered by a
 23 17 court.
 23 18    The division takes effect upon enactment and applies to
 23 19 equity investments in a qualifying business made on or after
 23 20 that date.  Equity investments in a qualifying business or
 23 21 community=based seed capital fund made prior to the effective
 23 22 date of the division shall be governed by current law.
 23 23    DIVISION III ==== ENTREPRENEUR INVESTMENT AWARDS PROGRAM.
 23 24  Division III amends the entrepreneur investment awards program
 23 25 administered by the EDA.  The division strikes provisions that
 23 26 prohibited the EDA from making awards under the program since
 23 27 July 1, 2014, and that required the EDA by December 31, 2014,
 23 28 to conduct a comprehensive review of the program and submit
 23 29 a report with specified information to the governor and the
 23 30 general assembly.
 23 31    The division modifies the purpose of the program to be
 23 32 to provide financial assistance to eligible entrepreneurial
 23 33 assistance providers (provider) that provide technical and
 23 34 financial assistance to entrepreneurs and start=up companies
 23 35 seeking to create, locate, or expand a business in Iowa.
 24  1 "Financial assistance" is defined in the division.
 24  2    The division changes the requirements for receiving an
 24  3 award.  To be eligible to receive an award under current
 24  4 law, an entrepreneurial assistance program must have been
 24  5 an Iowa=based business, expended at least $500,000 during
 24  6 the previous fiscal year to provide technical and financial
 24  7 assistance services that meet the broad=based needs of
 24  8 entrepreneurs seeking to create, locate, or expand a business
 24  9 in Iowa that intends to derive more than 10 percent of its
 24 10 gross sales from markets outside Iowa; and must have engaged
 24 11 and communicated with certain other programs, funding sources,
 24 12 and entities for its entrepreneur clients.  The division
 24 13 amends the eligibility for receiving financial assistance to
 24 14 require that a provider have its principal place of operations
 24 15 in Iowa and that the provider offer a comprehensive set of
 24 16 business development services to emerging and early=stage
 24 17 innovation companies to assist in the creation, location,
 24 18 growth, and long=term success of the company in Iowa.
 24 19 "Business development services" is defined in the division.
 24 20 Business development services may be performed at the physical
 24 21 location of the provider or the company and may be provided in
 24 22 consideration of equity participation in the company, a fee for
 24 23 services, or a membership agreement with the company.
 24 24    Under current law, the EDA board could approve, deny, or
 24 25 defer each application for a grant, and was required to award
 24 26 grants on a first=come, first=served basis.  The division
 24 27 specifies that the EDA board has the discretion to approve,
 24 28 deny, or defer each application for financial assistance and
 24 29 that the amount of financial assistance awarded to a provider
 24 30 is within the discretion of the EDA.  The division requires
 24 31 the EDA to award financial assistance on a competitive basis
 24 32 and allows the EDA to develop scoring criteria and establish
 24 33 minimum requirements for the receipt of a financial assistance
 24 34 award.
 24 35    In addition to the four factors relating to the provider's
 25  1 professional staff that the EDA may consider under current
 25  2 law in deciding whether to award financial assistance, the
 25  3 division provides that the EDA may also consider the service
 25  4 model and likelihood of success of the provider, the provider's
 25  5 similarity to other successful providers in the country, and
 25  6 the provider's financial need.
 25  7    The division modifies the maximum award amount for a
 25  8 recipient.  Under current law, a grant to an entrepreneur
 25  9 assistance program cannot exceed the lesser of 25 percent of
 25 10 the funds expended by the program during the previous fiscal
 25 11 year, 100 percent of the funds raised from certain persons
 25 12 by the program during the previous fiscal year, or $200,000.
 25 13 The division provides that the amount of financial assistance
 25 14 awarded to any one provider shall not exceed $200,000.
 25 15    The division modifies the permitted use of funds received
 25 16 under the program.  Under current law, grants are only
 25 17 permitted to be used for the purpose of operating costs
 25 18 incurred by the program.  The division specifies that financial
 25 19 assistance awarded to a provider shall only be used for
 25 20 the purpose of operating costs incurred by the provider in
 25 21 the provision of business development services to emerging
 25 22 and early=stage innovation companies in Iowa.  The division
 25 23 further requires that such financial assistance shall not be
 25 24 distributed to owners or investors of the company to which the
 25 25 business development services are being provided and shall not
 25 26 be provided to other persons assisting with the provision of
 25 27 the services.
 25 28    Under current law, an entrepreneurial assistance provider is
 25 29 required to accept client referrals from the EDA as a condition
 25 30 of receiving a grant.  The division provides that the EDA may
 25 31 make client referrals to eligible providers.
 25 32    DIVISION IV ==== MISCELLANEOUS CHANGES.  Division IV makes
 25 33 several miscellaneous changes to other EDA programs.  The
 25 34 division amends the sales and use tax refund available under
 25 35 the workforce housing tax incentive program.  That refund
 26  1 is available for sales and use tax paid prior to project
 26  2 completion, which is currently defined to mean the first date
 26  3 upon which the average annualized production of finished
 26  4 product for the preceding 90=day period at the manufacturing
 26  5 facility operated by the eligible business is at least 50
 26  6 percent of the initial design capacity of the facility.  The
 26  7 division amends the definition of "project completion" to mean
 26  8 the date on which the EDA notifies the department of revenue
 26  9 that all applicable requirements of a workforce housing tax
 26 10 incentive program agreement are satisfied.  This provision
 26 11 takes effect upon enactment and applies retroactively to July
 26 12 1, 2014, for all workforce housing tax incentive agreements
 26 13 entered into on or after that date.
 26 14    The division allows the EDA to extend the project
 26 15 completion date for a project awarded tax incentives under the
 26 16 redevelopment tax credit program and the housing enterprise
 26 17 zone tax incentives program if the property that is the subject
 26 18 of the project suffered a catastrophic fire during the 2014
 26 19 calendar year.
       LSB 1212HV (3) 86
       mm/sc
 19  7 to apply to the EDA during the calendar year following the
 19  8 calendar year in which the renewable chemicals are produced.
 19  9 The application must include the amount of renewable chemicals
 19 10 produced in Iowa from biomass feedstock by the eligible
 19 11 business during the calendar year, measured in pounds, and any
 19 12 other information reasonably required by the EDA in order to
 19 13 establish and verify eligibility under the program.  The EDA
 19 14 may accept applications on a continuous basis or may establish
 19 15 an annual application deadline.
 19 16    Before being issued a tax credit, an eligible business
 19 17 is required to enter into an agreement with the EDA for the
 19 18 successful completion of all requirements of the program.  The
 19 19 EDA is authorized to impose two compliance cost fees under the
 19 20 program.  The first fee equals $500 per agreement.  The second
 19 21 fee equals 0.5 percent of the value of the tax credit claimed
 19 22 pursuant to the agreement if the agreement has an aggregate tax
 19 23 credit value of $100,000 or greater.
 19 24    An eligible business that fails to comply with the
 19 25 requirements of the program or the terms of an agreement with
 19 26 the EDA may have its tax credits reduced, terminated, or
 19 27 rescinded, and may be subject to the repayment or recapture of
 19 28 claimed tax credits.
 19 29    Upon determining that all requirements of an agreement and
 19 30 the program have been fulfilled, the EDA shall issue a tax
 19 31 credit and related tax credit certificate to the eligible
 19 32 business in an amount equal to the product of $.05 multiplied
 19 33 by the number of pounds of renewable chemicals produced in Iowa
 19 34 from biomass feedstock by the eligible business during the
 19 35 calendar year.  Renewable chemicals produced by an eligible
 20  1 business prior to the effective date of the division, or
 20  2 prior to the date the business first qualifies as an eligible
 20  3 business, or after calendar year 2025, shall not qualify for
 20  4 the tax credit.
 20  5    The tax credit shall be claimed for the tax year during
 20  6 which the eligible business was issued the tax credit.  The tax
 20  7 credit may be claimed against the individual income tax and the
 20  8 corporate income tax.  The credit is refundable or may, at the
 20  9 election of the taxpayer, be carried forward for up to one tax
 20 10 year.   The tax credit shall not be transferred to any person.  A
 20 11 tax credit issued to a partnership, limited liability company,
 20 12 S corporation, cooperative organized under Code chapter 501
 20 13 and filing as a partnership for federal tax purposes, estate,
 20 14 or trust electing to have the income taxed directly to the
 20 15 individual may be claimed by the individual based upon the pro
 20 16 rata share of the individual's earnings from that entity.
 20 17    The division provides that the program is subject to the
 20 18 EDA's maximum aggregate tax credit cap of $170 million per
 20 19 fiscal year in Code section 15.119, and not more than $15
 20 20 million per fiscal year may be issued by the EDA under the
 20 21 program.  In addition, the maximum amount of tax credit that
 20 22 may be issued to an eligible business in any one calendar year
 20 23 shall not exceed $1 million or $500,000, depending on whether
 20 24 the eligible business has been operating in Iowa at the time of
 20 25 application for five or fewer years, or more than five years,
 20 26 respectively.  An eligible business shall not receive more than
 20 27 five tax credits under the program.  The EDA is required to
 20 28 issue tax credits on a first=come, first=served basis until the
 20 29 maximum amount of $15 million per fiscal year is reached.  If
 20 30 the amount of tax credits exceeds this amount in a fiscal year,
 20 31 the EDA is required to establish a wait list and give priority
 20 32 in subsequent years to the eligible businesses on the wait
 20 33 list.
 20 34    The division provides for the confidentiality of certain
 20 35 information under the program.  The identity of a tax credit
 21  1 recipient and the amount of the tax credit shall be considered
 21  2 public information under Code chapter 22 (examination of public
 21  3 records), but any other information or record in the possession
 21  4 of the EDA with respect to the program shall be presumed by
 21  5 the EDA to be a trade secret protected under Code chapter 550
 21  6 or common law and shall be kept confidential by the EDA unless
 21  7 otherwise ordered by a court.
 21  8    The division takes effect upon enactment and applies to
 21  9 renewable chemicals produced in Iowa from biomass feedstock on
 21 10 or after that date.  The division applies retroactively to tax
 21 11 years beginning on or after January 1, 2015.
 21 12    DIVISION II ==== ANGEL INVESTOR TAX CREDITS.   Division II
 21 13 makes several changes to the tax credit for investments in
 21 14 qualifying businesses and community=based seed capital funds,
 21 15 often referred to as the angel investor tax credits.  The
 21 16 division amends the purpose of the tax credit in Code section
 21 17 15E.41.  The division excludes investments in community=based
 21 18 seed capital funds from qualifying for the tax credit and
 21 19 makes several conforming amendments to remove references to
 21 20 community=based seed capital funds from the Code.
 21 21    The division modifies the amount and dollar limitation of
 21 22 the tax credit for a taxpayer.  The tax credit is increased
 21 23 from 20 percent to 25 percent of a taxpayer's equity investment
 21 24 in a qualifying business.  Under current law, a taxpayer cannot
 21 25 claim more than $50,000 of tax credit per investment in a
 21 26 qualifying business, and for each tax year a taxpayer and the
 21 27 taxpayer's affiliates cannot claim tax credits for more than
 21 28 five investments in five different qualifying businesses.  The
 21 29 division amends this dollar limitation to prohibit a natural
 21 30 person and the person's spouse, child, or sibling from claiming
 21 31 a combined amount of more than $100,000 in tax credits per tax
 21 32 year.
 21 33    The division also provides that no more than $500,000 in tax
 21 34 credits may be issued per tax year for equity investments in
 21 35 any one qualifying business.
 22  1 The division modifies the procedures for claiming the tax
 22  2 credit.  Under current law, the tax credit is not refundable
 22  3 but available for carryforward for up to five tax years.  The
 22  4 division makes the tax credit refundable for an investment
 22  5 made by a natural person, and for any other person reduces the
 22  6 carryforward period to three years.
 22  7    The division strikes a provision permitting the EDA
 22  8 to cooperate with small business development centers to
 22  9 disseminate information regarding the credits and to develop
 22 10 standard application forms, and requiring the EDA to distribute
 22 11 copies of the application forms to all community=based seed
 22 12 capital funds and potential individual investors.
 22 13    The division modifies the eligibility requirements for
 22 14 qualifying businesses.  The division strikes the requirement
 22 15 that a business have an owner that meets at least one of
 22 16 four qualifications relating to business education or
 22 17 business experience.  The division requires that a business
 22 18 be participating in an entrepreneurial assistance program,
 22 19 as defined in the division, but allows the EDA to waive this
 22 20 requirement if the business establishes that its owners,
 22 21 directors, officers, and employees have an appropriate level
 22 22 of experience such that an entrepreneurial assistance program
 22 23 would not materially change the prospects of the business.
 22 24 The EDA is allowed to consult with outside service providers
 22 25 in considering such a waiver.  The division increases from $5
 22 26 million to $10 million the maximum amount of net worth that
 22 27 a business may have to be considered a qualifying business.
 22 28 The division increases from $250,000 to $500,000 the amount of
 22 29 financing that a business must have in order to be considered a
 22 30 qualifying business, removes "near equity" from the types of
 22 31 financing that will be considered in that calculation, requires
 22 32 that the financing be secured at the time of application for
 22 33 the tax credits, and requires that the business have at least
 22 34 two investors at the time of application for the tax credits.
 22 35 These modified eligibility requirements apply to businesses
 23  1 that submit an application to the EDA to be registered as a
 23  2 qualifying business on or after the effective date of this
 23  3 division of the bill, and businesses that submitted such an
 23  4 application to the EDA before the effective date of this
 23  5 division of the bill shall be governed by current law.
 23  6    The division provides for the confidentiality of certain
 23  7 information with regard to the tax credit.  The identity of
 23  8 a qualifying business, the identity of an investor and the
 23  9 qualifying business in which the investor made an equity
 23 10 investment, and the total number and amount of tax credits
 23 11 issued shall be considered public information under Code
 23 12 chapter 22 (examination of public records), but any other
 23 13 information or record in the possession of the EDA with respect
 23 14 to the program shall be presumed by the EDA to be a trade secret
 23 15 protected under Code chapter 550 or common law and shall be
 23 16 kept confidential by the EDA unless otherwise ordered by a
 23 17 court.
 23 18    The division takes effect upon enactment and applies to
 23 19 equity investments in a qualifying business made on or after
 23 20 that date.  Equity investments in a qualifying business or
 23 21 community=based seed capital fund made prior to the effective
 23 22 date of the division shall be governed by current law.
 23 23    DIVISION III ==== ENTREPRENEUR INVESTMENT AWARDS PROGRAM.
 23 24  Division III amends the entrepreneur investment awards program
 23 25 administered by the EDA.  The division strikes provisions that
 23 26 prohibited the EDA from making awards under the program since
 23 27 July 1, 2014, and that required the EDA by December 31, 2014,
 23 28 to conduct a comprehensive review of the program and submit
 23 29 a report with specified information to the governor and the
 23 30 general assembly.
 23 31    The division modifies the purpose of the program to be
 23 32 to provide financial assistance to eligible entrepreneurial
 23 33 assistance providers (provider) that provide technical and
 23 34 financial assistance to entrepreneurs and start=up companies
 23 35 seeking to create, locate, or expand a business in Iowa.
 24  1 "Financial assistance" is defined in the division.
 24  2    The division changes the requirements for receiving an
 24  3 award.  To be eligible to receive an award under current
 24  4 law, an entrepreneurial assistance program must have been
 24  5 an Iowa=based business, expended at least $500,000 during
 24  6 the previous fiscal year to provide technical and financial
 24  7 assistance services that meet the broad=based needs of
 24  8 entrepreneurs seeking to create, locate, or expand a business
 24  9 in Iowa that intends to derive more than 10 percent of its
 24 10 gross sales from markets outside Iowa; and must have engaged
 24 11 and communicated with certain other programs, funding sources,
 24 12 and entities for its entrepreneur clients.  The division
 24 13 amends the eligibility for receiving financial assistance to
 24 14 require that a provider have its principal place of operations
 24 15 in Iowa and that the provider offer a comprehensive set of
 24 16 business development services to emerging and early=stage
 24 17 innovation companies to assist in the creation, location,
 24 18 growth, and long=term success of the company in Iowa.
 24 19 "Business development services" is defined in the division.
 24 20 Business development services may be performed at the physical
 24 21 location of the provider or the company and may be provided in
 24 22 consideration of equity participation in the company, a fee for
 24 23 services, or a membership agreement with the company.
 24 24    Under current law, the EDA board could approve, deny, or
 24 25 defer each application for a grant, and was required to award
 24 26 grants on a first=come, first=served basis.  The division
 24 27 specifies that the EDA board has the discretion to approve,
 24 28 deny, or defer each application for financial assistance and
 24 29 that the amount of financial assistance awarded to a provider
 24 30 is within the discretion of the EDA.  The division requires
 24 31 the EDA to award financial assistance on a competitive basis
 24 32 and allows the EDA to develop scoring criteria and establish
 24 33 minimum requirements for the receipt of a financial assistance
 24 34 award.
 24 35    In addition to the four factors relating to the provider's
 25  1 professional staff that the EDA may consider under current
 25  2 law in deciding whether to award financial assistance, the
 25  3 division provides that the EDA may also consider the service
 25  4 model and likelihood of success of the provider, the provider's
 25  5 similarity to other successful providers in the country, and
 25  6 the provider's financial need.
 25  7    The division modifies the maximum award amount for a
 25  8 recipient.  Under current law, a grant to an entrepreneur
 25  9 assistance program cannot exceed the lesser of 25 percent of
 25 10 the funds expended by the program during the previous fiscal
 25 11 year, 100 percent of the funds raised from certain persons
 25 12 by the program during the previous fiscal year, or $200,000.
 25 13 The division provides that the amount of financial assistance
 25 14 awarded to any one provider shall not exceed $200,000.
 25 15    The division modifies the permitted use of funds received
 25 16 under the program.  Under current law, grants are only
 25 17 permitted to be used for the purpose of operating costs
 25 18 incurred by the program.  The division specifies that financial
 25 19 assistance awarded to a provider shall only be used for
 25 20 the purpose of operating costs incurred by the provider in
 25 21 the provision of business development services to emerging
 25 22 and early=stage innovation companies in Iowa.  The division
 25 23 further requires that such financial assistance shall not be
 25 24 distributed to owners or investors of the company to which the
 25 25 business development services are being provided and shall not
 25 26 be provided to other persons assisting with the provision of
 25 27 the services.
 25 28    Under current law, an entrepreneurial assistance provider is
 25 29 required to accept client referrals from the EDA as a condition
 25 30 of receiving a grant.  The division provides that the EDA may
 25 31 make client referrals to eligible providers.
 25 32    DIVISION IV ==== MISCELLANEOUS CHANGES.  Division IV makes
 25 33 several miscellaneous changes to other EDA programs.  The
 25 34 division amends the sales and use tax refund available under
 25 35 the workforce housing tax incentive program.  That refund
 26  1 is available for sales and use tax paid prior to project
 26  2 completion, which is currently defined to mean the first date
 26  3 upon which the average annualized production of finished
 26  4 product for the preceding 90=day period at the manufacturing
 26  5 facility operated by the eligible business is at least 50
 26  6 percent of the initial design capacity of the facility.  The
 26  7 division amends the definition of "project completion" to mean
 26  8 the date on which the EDA notifies the department of revenue
 26  9 that all applicable requirements of a workforce housing tax
 26 10 incentive program agreement are satisfied.  This provision
 26 11 takes effect upon enactment and applies retroactively to July
 26 12 1, 2014, for all workforce housing tax incentive agreements
 26 13 entered into on or after that date.
 26 14    The division allows the EDA to extend the project
 26 15 completion date for a project awarded tax incentives under the
 26 16 redevelopment tax credit program and the housing enterprise
 26 17 zone tax incentives program if the property that is the subject
 26 18 of the project suffered a catastrophic fire during the 2014
 26 19 calendar year.
       LSB 1212HV (3) 86
       mm/sc
 19  8 calendar year in which the renewable chemicals are produced.
 19  9 The application must include the amount of renewable chemicals
 19 10 produced in Iowa from biomass feedstock by the eligible
 19 11 business during the calendar year, measured in pounds, and any
 19 12 other information reasonably required by the EDA in order to
 19 13 establish and verify eligibility under the program.  The EDA
 19 14 may accept applications on a continuous basis or may establish
 19 15 an annual application deadline.
 19 16    Before being issued a tax credit, an eligible business
 19 17 is required to enter into an agreement with the EDA for the
 19 18 successful completion of all requirements of the program.  The
 19 19 EDA is authorized to impose two compliance cost fees under the
 19 20 program.  The first fee equals $500 per agreement.  The second
 19 21 fee equals 0.5 percent of the value of the tax credit claimed
 19 22 pursuant to the agreement if the agreement has an aggregate tax
 19 23 credit value of $100,000 or greater.
 19 24    An eligible business that fails to comply with the
 19 25 requirements of the program or the terms of an agreement with
 19 26 the EDA may have its tax credits reduced, terminated, or
 19 27 rescinded, and may be subject to the repayment or recapture of
 19 28 claimed tax credits.
 19 29    Upon determining that all requirements of an agreement and
 19 30 the program have been fulfilled, the EDA shall issue a tax
 19 31 credit and related tax credit certificate to the eligible
 19 32 business in an amount equal to the product of $.05 multiplied
 19 33 by the number of pounds of renewable chemicals produced in Iowa
 19 34 from biomass feedstock by the eligible business during the
 19 35 calendar year.  Renewable chemicals produced by an eligible
 20  1 business prior to the effective date of the division, or
 20  2 prior to the date the business first qualifies as an eligible
 20  3 business, or after calendar year 2025, shall not qualify for
 20  4 the tax credit.
 20  5    The tax credit shall be claimed for the tax year during
 20  6 which the eligible business was issued the tax credit.  The tax
 20  7 credit may be claimed against the individual income tax and the
 20  8 corporate income tax.  The credit is refundable or may, at the
 20  9 election of the taxpayer, be carried forward for up to one tax
 20 10 year.   The tax credit shall not be transferred to any person.  A
 20 11 tax credit issued to a partnership, limited liability company,
 20 12 S corporation, cooperative organized under Code chapter 501
 20 13 and filing as a partnership for federal tax purposes, estate,
 20 14 or trust electing to have the income taxed directly to the
 20 15 individual may be claimed by the individual based upon the pro
 20 16 rata share of the individual's earnings from that entity.
 20 17    The division provides that the program is subject to the
 20 18 EDA's maximum aggregate tax credit cap of $170 million per
 20 19 fiscal year in Code section 15.119, and not more than $15
 20 20 million per fiscal year may be issued by the EDA under the
 20 21 program.  In addition, the maximum amount of tax credit that
 20 22 may be issued to an eligible business in any one calendar year
 20 23 shall not exceed $1 million or $500,000, depending on whether
 20 24 the eligible business has been operating in Iowa at the time of
 20 25 application for five or fewer years, or more than five years,
 20 26 respectively.  An eligible business shall not receive more than
 20 27 five tax credits under the program.  The EDA is required to
 20 28 issue tax credits on a first=come, first=served basis until the
 20 29 maximum amount of $15 million per fiscal year is reached.  If
 20 30 the amount of tax credits exceeds this amount in a fiscal year,
 20 31 the EDA is required to establish a wait list and give priority
 20 32 in subsequent years to the eligible businesses on the wait
 20 33 list.
 20 34    The division provides for the confidentiality of certain
 20 35 information under the program.  The identity of a tax credit
 21  1 recipient and the amount of the tax credit shall be considered
 21  2 public information under Code chapter 22 (examination of public
 21  3 records), but any other information or record in the possession
 21  4 of the EDA with respect to the program shall be presumed by
 21  5 the EDA to be a trade secret protected under Code chapter 550
 21  6 or common law and shall be kept confidential by the EDA unless
 21  7 otherwise ordered by a court.
 21  8    The division takes effect upon enactment and applies to
 21  9 renewable chemicals produced in Iowa from biomass feedstock on
 21 10 or after that date.  The division applies retroactively to tax
 21 11 years beginning on or after January 1, 2015.
 21 12    DIVISION II ==== ANGEL INVESTOR TAX CREDITS.   Division II
 21 13 makes several changes to the tax credit for investments in
 21 14 qualifying businesses and community=based seed capital funds,
 21 15 often referred to as the angel investor tax credits.  The
 21 16 division amends the purpose of the tax credit in Code section
 21 17 15E.41.  The division excludes investments in community=based
 21 18 seed capital funds from qualifying for the tax credit and
 21 19 makes several conforming amendments to remove references to
 21 20 community=based seed capital funds from the Code.
 21 21    The division modifies the amount and dollar limitation of
 21 22 the tax credit for a taxpayer.  The tax credit is increased
 21 23 from 20 percent to 25 percent of a taxpayer's equity investment
 21 24 in a qualifying business.  Under current law, a taxpayer cannot
 21 25 claim more than $50,000 of tax credit per investment in a
 21 26 qualifying business, and for each tax year a taxpayer and the
 21 27 taxpayer's affiliates cannot claim tax credits for more than
 21 28 five investments in five different qualifying businesses.  The
 21 29 division amends this dollar limitation to prohibit a natural
 21 30 person and the person's spouse, child, or sibling from claiming
 21 31 a combined amount of more than $100,000 in tax credits per tax
 21 32 year.
 21 33    The division also provides that no more than $500,000 in tax
 21 34 credits may be issued per tax year for equity investments in
 21 35 any one qualifying business.
 22  1 The division modifies the procedures for claiming the tax
 22  2 credit.  Under current law, the tax credit is not refundable
 22  3 but available for carryforward for up to five tax years.  The
 22  4 division makes the tax credit refundable for an investment
 22  5 made by a natural person, and for any other person reduces the
 22  6 carryforward period to three years.
 22  7    The division strikes a provision permitting the EDA
 22  8 to cooperate with small business development centers to
 22  9 disseminate information regarding the credits and to develop
 22 10 standard application forms, and requiring the EDA to distribute
 22 11 copies of the application forms to all community=based seed
 22 12 capital funds and potential individual investors.
 22 13    The division modifies the eligibility requirements for
 22 14 qualifying businesses.  The division strikes the requirement
 22 15 that a business have an owner that meets at least one of
 22 16 four qualifications relating to business education or
 22 17 business experience.  The division requires that a business
 22 18 be participating in an entrepreneurial assistance program,
 22 19 as defined in the division, but allows the EDA to waive this
 22 20 requirement if the business establishes that its owners,
 22 21 directors, officers, and employees have an appropriate level
 22 22 of experience such that an entrepreneurial assistance program
 22 23 would not materially change the prospects of the business.
 22 24 The EDA is allowed to consult with outside service providers
 22 25 in considering such a waiver.  The division increases from $5
 22 26 million to $10 million the maximum amount of net worth that
 22 27 a business may have to be considered a qualifying business.
 22 28 The division increases from $250,000 to $500,000 the amount of
 22 29 financing that a business must have in order to be considered a
 22 30 qualifying business, removes "near equity" from the types of
 22 31 financing that will be considered in that calculation, requires
 22 32 that the financing be secured at the time of application for
 22 33 the tax credits, and requires that the business have at least
 22 34 two investors at the time of application for the tax credits.
 22 35 These modified eligibility requirements apply to businesses
 23  1 that submit an application to the EDA to be registered as a
 23  2 qualifying business on or after the effective date of this
 23  3 division of the bill, and businesses that submitted such an
 23  4 application to the EDA before the effective date of this
 23  5 division of the bill shall be governed by current law.
 23  6    The division provides for the confidentiality of certain
 23  7 information with regard to the tax credit.  The identity of
 23  8 a qualifying business, the identity of an investor and the
 23  9 qualifying business in which the investor made an equity
 23 10 investment, and the total number and amount of tax credits
 23 11 issued shall be considered public information under Code
 23 12 chapter 22 (examination of public records), but any other
 23 13 information or record in the possession of the EDA with respect
 23 14 to the program shall be presumed by the EDA to be a trade secret
 23 15 protected under Code chapter 550 or common law and shall be
 23 16 kept confidential by the EDA unless otherwise ordered by a
 23 17 court.
 23 18    The division takes effect upon enactment and applies to
 23 19 equity investments in a qualifying business made on or after
 23 20 that date.  Equity investments in a qualifying business or
 23 21 community=based seed capital fund made prior to the effective
 23 22 date of the division shall be governed by current law.
 23 23    DIVISION III ==== ENTREPRENEUR INVESTMENT AWARDS PROGRAM.
 23 24  Division III amends the entrepreneur investment awards program
 23 25 administered by the EDA.  The division strikes provisions that
 23 26 prohibited the EDA from making awards under the program since
 23 27 July 1, 2014, and that required the EDA by December 31, 2014,
 23 28 to conduct a comprehensive review of the program and submit
 23 29 a report with specified information to the governor and the
 23 30 general assembly.
 23 31    The division modifies the purpose of the program to be
 23 32 to provide financial assistance to eligible entrepreneurial
 23 33 assistance providers (provider) that provide technical and
 23 34 financial assistance to entrepreneurs and start=up companies
 23 35 seeking to create, locate, or expand a business in Iowa.
 24  1 "Financial assistance" is defined in the division.
 24  2    The division changes the requirements for receiving an
 24  3 award.  To be eligible to receive an award under current
 24  4 law, an entrepreneurial assistance program must have been
 24  5 an Iowa=based business, expended at least $500,000 during
 24  6 the previous fiscal year to provide technical and financial
 24  7 assistance services that meet the broad=based needs of
 24  8 entrepreneurs seeking to create, locate, or expand a business
 24  9 in Iowa that intends to derive more than 10 percent of its
 24 10 gross sales from markets outside Iowa; and must have engaged
 24 11 and communicated with certain other programs, funding sources,
 24 12 and entities for its entrepreneur clients.  The division
 24 13 amends the eligibility for receiving financial assistance to
 24 14 require that a provider have its principal place of operations
 24 15 in Iowa and that the provider offer a comprehensive set of
 24 16 business development services to emerging and early=stage
 24 17 innovation companies to assist in the creation, location,
 24 18 growth, and long=term success of the company in Iowa.
 24 19 "Business development services" is defined in the division.
 24 20 Business development services may be performed at the physical
 24 21 location of the provider or the company and may be provided in
 24 22 consideration of equity participation in the company, a fee for
 24 23 services, or a membership agreement with the company.
 24 24    Under current law, the EDA board could approve, deny, or
 24 25 defer each application for a grant, and was required to award
 24 26 grants on a first=come, first=served basis.  The division
 24 27 specifies that the EDA board has the discretion to approve,
 24 28 deny, or defer each application for financial assistance and
 24 29 that the amount of financial assistance awarded to a provider
 24 30 is within the discretion of the EDA.  The division requires
 24 31 the EDA to award financial assistance on a competitive basis
 24 32 and allows the EDA to develop scoring criteria and establish
 24 33 minimum requirements for the receipt of a financial assistance
 24 34 award.
 24 35    In addition to the four factors relating to the provider's
 25  1 professional staff that the EDA may consider under current
 25  2 law in deciding whether to award financial assistance, the
 25  3 division provides that the EDA may also consider the service
 25  4 model and likelihood of success of the provider, the provider's
 25  5 similarity to other successful providers in the country, and
 25  6 the provider's financial need.
 25  7    The division modifies the maximum award amount for a
 25  8 recipient.  Under current law, a grant to an entrepreneur
 25  9 assistance program cannot exceed the lesser of 25 percent of
 25 10 the funds expended by the program during the previous fiscal
 25 11 year, 100 percent of the funds raised from certain persons
 25 12 by the program during the previous fiscal year, or $200,000.
 25 13 The division provides that the amount of financial assistance
 25 14 awarded to any one provider shall not exceed $200,000.
 25 15    The division modifies the permitted use of funds received
 25 16 under the program.  Under current law, grants are only
 25 17 permitted to be used for the purpose of operating costs
 25 18 incurred by the program.  The division specifies that financial
 25 19 assistance awarded to a provider shall only be used for
 25 20 the purpose of operating costs incurred by the provider in
 25 21 the provision of business development services to emerging
 25 22 and early=stage innovation companies in Iowa.  The division
 25 23 further requires that such financial assistance shall not be
 25 24 distributed to owners or investors of the company to which the
 25 25 business development services are being provided and shall not
 25 26 be provided to other persons assisting with the provision of
 25 27 the services.
 25 28    Under current law, an entrepreneurial assistance provider is
 25 29 required to accept client referrals from the EDA as a condition
 25 30 of receiving a grant.  The division provides that the EDA may
 25 31 make client referrals to eligible providers.
 25 32    DIVISION IV ==== MISCELLANEOUS CHANGES.  Division IV makes
 25 33 several miscellaneous changes to other EDA programs.  The
 25 34 division amends the sales and use tax refund available under
 25 35 the workforce housing tax incentive program.  That refund
 26  1 is available for sales and use tax paid prior to project
 26  2 completion, which is currently defined to mean the first date
 26  3 upon which the average annualized production of finished
 26  4 product for the preceding 90=day period at the manufacturing
 26  5 facility operated by the eligible business is at least 50
 26  6 percent of the initial design capacity of the facility.  The
 26  7 division amends the definition of "project completion" to mean
 26  8 the date on which the EDA notifies the department of revenue
 26  9 that all applicable requirements of a workforce housing tax
 26 10 incentive program agreement are satisfied.  This provision
 26 11 takes effect upon enactment and applies retroactively to July
 26 12 1, 2014, for all workforce housing tax incentive agreements
 26 13 entered into on or after that date.
 26 14    The division allows the EDA to extend the project
 26 15 completion date for a project awarded tax incentives under the
 26 16 redevelopment tax credit program and the housing enterprise
 26 17 zone tax incentives program if the property that is the subject
 26 18 of the project suffered a catastrophic fire during the 2014
 26 19 calendar year.
       LSB 1212HV (3) 86
       mm/sc
 19  9 The application must include the amount of renewable chemicals
 19 10 produced in Iowa from biomass feedstock by the eligible
 19 11 business during the calendar year, measured in pounds, and any
 19 12 other information reasonably required by the EDA in order to
 19 13 establish and verify eligibility under the program.  The EDA
 19 14 may accept applications on a continuous basis or may establish
 19 15 an annual application deadline.
 19 16    Before being issued a tax credit, an eligible business
 19 17 is required to enter into an agreement with the EDA for the
 19 18 successful completion of all requirements of the program.  The
 19 19 EDA is authorized to impose two compliance cost fees under the
 19 20 program.  The first fee equals $500 per agreement.  The second
 19 21 fee equals 0.5 percent of the value of the tax credit claimed
 19 22 pursuant to the agreement if the agreement has an aggregate tax
 19 23 credit value of $100,000 or greater.
 19 24    An eligible business that fails to comply with the
 19 25 requirements of the program or the terms of an agreement with
 19 26 the EDA may have its tax credits reduced, terminated, or
 19 27 rescinded, and may be subject to the repayment or recapture of
 19 28 claimed tax credits.
 19 29    Upon determining that all requirements of an agreement and
 19 30 the program have been fulfilled, the EDA shall issue a tax
 19 31 credit and related tax credit certificate to the eligible
 19 32 business in an amount equal to the product of $.05 multiplied
 19 33 by the number of pounds of renewable chemicals produced in Iowa
 19 34 from biomass feedstock by the eligible business during the
 19 35 calendar year.  Renewable chemicals produced by an eligible
 20  1 business prior to the effective date of the division, or
 20  2 prior to the date the business first qualifies as an eligible
 20  3 business, or after calendar year 2025, shall not qualify for
 20  4 the tax credit.
 20  5    The tax credit shall be claimed for the tax year during
 20  6 which the eligible business was issued the tax credit.  The tax
 20  7 credit may be claimed against the individual income tax and the
 20  8 corporate income tax.  The credit is refundable or may, at the
 20  9 election of the taxpayer, be carried forward for up to one tax
 20 10 year.   The tax credit shall not be transferred to any person.  A
 20 11 tax credit issued to a partnership, limited liability company,
 20 12 S corporation, cooperative organized under Code chapter 501
 20 13 and filing as a partnership for federal tax purposes, estate,
 20 14 or trust electing to have the income taxed directly to the
 20 15 individual may be claimed by the individual based upon the pro
 20 16 rata share of the individual's earnings from that entity.
 20 17    The division provides that the program is subject to the
 20 18 EDA's maximum aggregate tax credit cap of $170 million per
 20 19 fiscal year in Code section 15.119, and not more than $15
 20 20 million per fiscal year may be issued by the EDA under the
 20 21 program.  In addition, the maximum amount of tax credit that
 20 22 may be issued to an eligible business in any one calendar year
 20 23 shall not exceed $1 million or $500,000, depending on whether
 20 24 the eligible business has been operating in Iowa at the time of
 20 25 application for five or fewer years, or more than five years,
 20 26 respectively.  An eligible business shall not receive more than
 20 27 five tax credits under the program.  The EDA is required to
 20 28 issue tax credits on a first=come, first=served basis until the
 20 29 maximum amount of $15 million per fiscal year is reached.  If
 20 30 the amount of tax credits exceeds this amount in a fiscal year,
 20 31 the EDA is required to establish a wait list and give priority
 20 32 in subsequent years to the eligible businesses on the wait
 20 33 list.
 20 34    The division provides for the confidentiality of certain
 20 35 information under the program.  The identity of a tax credit
 21  1 recipient and the amount of the tax credit shall be considered
 21  2 public information under Code chapter 22 (examination of public
 21  3 records), but any other information or record in the possession
 21  4 of the EDA with respect to the program shall be presumed by
 21  5 the EDA to be a trade secret protected under Code chapter 550
 21  6 or common law and shall be kept confidential by the EDA unless
 21  7 otherwise ordered by a court.
 21  8    The division takes effect upon enactment and applies to
 21  9 renewable chemicals produced in Iowa from biomass feedstock on
 21 10 or after that date.  The division applies retroactively to tax
 21 11 years beginning on or after January 1, 2015.
 21 12    DIVISION II ==== ANGEL INVESTOR TAX CREDITS.   Division II
 21 13 makes several changes to the tax credit for investments in
 21 14 qualifying businesses and community=based seed capital funds,
 21 15 often referred to as the angel investor tax credits.  The
 21 16 division amends the purpose of the tax credit in Code section
 21 17 15E.41.  The division excludes investments in community=based
 21 18 seed capital funds from qualifying for the tax credit and
 21 19 makes several conforming amendments to remove references to
 21 20 community=based seed capital funds from the Code.
 21 21    The division modifies the amount and dollar limitation of
 21 22 the tax credit for a taxpayer.  The tax credit is increased
 21 23 from 20 percent to 25 percent of a taxpayer's equity investment
 21 24 in a qualifying business.  Under current law, a taxpayer cannot
 21 25 claim more than $50,000 of tax credit per investment in a
 21 26 qualifying business, and for each tax year a taxpayer and the
 21 27 taxpayer's affiliates cannot claim tax credits for more than
 21 28 five investments in five different qualifying businesses.  The
 21 29 division amends this dollar limitation to prohibit a natural
 21 30 person and the person's spouse, child, or sibling from claiming
 21 31 a combined amount of more than $100,000 in tax credits per tax
 21 32 year.
 21 33    The division also provides that no more than $500,000 in tax
 21 34 credits may be issued per tax year for equity investments in
 21 35 any one qualifying business.
 22  1 The division modifies the procedures for claiming the tax
 22  2 credit.  Under current law, the tax credit is not refundable
 22  3 but available for carryforward for up to five tax years.  The
 22  4 division makes the tax credit refundable for an investment
 22  5 made by a natural person, and for any other person reduces the
 22  6 carryforward period to three years.
 22  7    The division strikes a provision permitting the EDA
 22  8 to cooperate with small business development centers to
 22  9 disseminate information regarding the credits and to develop
 22 10 standard application forms, and requiring the EDA to distribute
 22 11 copies of the application forms to all community=based seed
 22 12 capital funds and potential individual investors.
 22 13    The division modifies the eligibility requirements for
 22 14 qualifying businesses.  The division strikes the requirement
 22 15 that a business have an owner that meets at least one of
 22 16 four qualifications relating to business education or
 22 17 business experience.  The division requires that a business
 22 18 be participating in an entrepreneurial assistance program,
 22 19 as defined in the division, but allows the EDA to waive this
 22 20 requirement if the business establishes that its owners,
 22 21 directors, officers, and employees have an appropriate level
 22 22 of experience such that an entrepreneurial assistance program
 22 23 would not materially change the prospects of the business.
 22 24 The EDA is allowed to consult with outside service providers
 22 25 in considering such a waiver.  The division increases from $5
 22 26 million to $10 million the maximum amount of net worth that
 22 27 a business may have to be considered a qualifying business.
 22 28 The division increases from $250,000 to $500,000 the amount of
 22 29 financing that a business must have in order to be considered a
 22 30 qualifying business, removes "near equity" from the types of
 22 31 financing that will be considered in that calculation, requires
 22 32 that the financing be secured at the time of application for
 22 33 the tax credits, and requires that the business have at least
 22 34 two investors at the time of application for the tax credits.
 22 35 These modified eligibility requirements apply to businesses
 23  1 that submit an application to the EDA to be registered as a
 23  2 qualifying business on or after the effective date of this
 23  3 division of the bill, and businesses that submitted such an
 23  4 application to the EDA before the effective date of this
 23  5 division of the bill shall be governed by current law.
 23  6    The division provides for the confidentiality of certain
 23  7 information with regard to the tax credit.  The identity of
 23  8 a qualifying business, the identity of an investor and the
 23  9 qualifying business in which the investor made an equity
 23 10 investment, and the total number and amount of tax credits
 23 11 issued shall be considered public information under Code
 23 12 chapter 22 (examination of public records), but any other
 23 13 information or record in the possession of the EDA with respect
 23 14 to the program shall be presumed by the EDA to be a trade secret
 23 15 protected under Code chapter 550 or common law and shall be
 23 16 kept confidential by the EDA unless otherwise ordered by a
 23 17 court.
 23 18    The division takes effect upon enactment and applies to
 23 19 equity investments in a qualifying business made on or after
 23 20 that date.  Equity investments in a qualifying business or
 23 21 community=based seed capital fund made prior to the effective
 23 22 date of the division shall be governed by current law.
 23 23    DIVISION III ==== ENTREPRENEUR INVESTMENT AWARDS PROGRAM.
 23 24  Division III amends the entrepreneur investment awards program
 23 25 administered by the EDA.  The division strikes provisions that
 23 26 prohibited the EDA from making awards under the program since
 23 27 July 1, 2014, and that required the EDA by December 31, 2014,
 23 28 to conduct a comprehensive review of the program and submit
 23 29 a report with specified information to the governor and the
 23 30 general assembly.
 23 31    The division modifies the purpose of the program to be
 23 32 to provide financial assistance to eligible entrepreneurial
 23 33 assistance providers (provider) that provide technical and
 23 34 financial assistance to entrepreneurs and start=up companies
 23 35 seeking to create, locate, or expand a business in Iowa.
 24  1 "Financial assistance" is defined in the division.
 24  2    The division changes the requirements for receiving an
 24  3 award.  To be eligible to receive an award under current
 24  4 law, an entrepreneurial assistance program must have been
 24  5 an Iowa=based business, expended at least $500,000 during
 24  6 the previous fiscal year to provide technical and financial
 24  7 assistance services that meet the broad=based needs of
 24  8 entrepreneurs seeking to create, locate, or expand a business
 24  9 in Iowa that intends to derive more than 10 percent of its
 24 10 gross sales from markets outside Iowa; and must have engaged
 24 11 and communicated with certain other programs, funding sources,
 24 12 and entities for its entrepreneur clients.  The division
 24 13 amends the eligibility for receiving financial assistance to
 24 14 require that a provider have its principal place of operations
 24 15 in Iowa and that the provider offer a comprehensive set of
 24 16 business development services to emerging and early=stage
 24 17 innovation companies to assist in the creation, location,
 24 18 growth, and long=term success of the company in Iowa.
 24 19 "Business development services" is defined in the division.
 24 20 Business development services may be performed at the physical
 24 21 location of the provider or the company and may be provided in
 24 22 consideration of equity participation in the company, a fee for
 24 23 services, or a membership agreement with the company.
 24 24    Under current law, the EDA board could approve, deny, or
 24 25 defer each application for a grant, and was required to award
 24 26 grants on a first=come, first=served basis.  The division
 24 27 specifies that the EDA board has the discretion to approve,
 24 28 deny, or defer each application for financial assistance and
 24 29 that the amount of financial assistance awarded to a provider
 24 30 is within the discretion of the EDA.  The division requires
 24 31 the EDA to award financial assistance on a competitive basis
 24 32 and allows the EDA to develop scoring criteria and establish
 24 33 minimum requirements for the receipt of a financial assistance
 24 34 award.
 24 35    In addition to the four factors relating to the provider's
 25  1 professional staff that the EDA may consider under current
 25  2 law in deciding whether to award financial assistance, the
 25  3 division provides that the EDA may also consider the service
 25  4 model and likelihood of success of the provider, the provider's
 25  5 similarity to other successful providers in the country, and
 25  6 the provider's financial need.
 25  7    The division modifies the maximum award amount for a
 25  8 recipient.  Under current law, a grant to an entrepreneur
 25  9 assistance program cannot exceed the lesser of 25 percent of
 25 10 the funds expended by the program during the previous fiscal
 25 11 year, 100 percent of the funds raised from certain persons
 25 12 by the program during the previous fiscal year, or $200,000.
 25 13 The division provides that the amount of financial assistance
 25 14 awarded to any one provider shall not exceed $200,000.
 25 15    The division modifies the permitted use of funds received
 25 16 under the program.  Under current law, grants are only
 25 17 permitted to be used for the purpose of operating costs
 25 18 incurred by the program.  The division specifies that financial
 25 19 assistance awarded to a provider shall only be used for
 25 20 the purpose of operating costs incurred by the provider in
 25 21 the provision of business development services to emerging
 25 22 and early=stage innovation companies in Iowa.  The division
 25 23 further requires that such financial assistance shall not be
 25 24 distributed to owners or investors of the company to which the
 25 25 business development services are being provided and shall not
 25 26 be provided to other persons assisting with the provision of
 25 27 the services.
 25 28    Under current law, an entrepreneurial assistance provider is
 25 29 required to accept client referrals from the EDA as a condition
 25 30 of receiving a grant.  The division provides that the EDA may
 25 31 make client referrals to eligible providers.
 25 32    DIVISION IV ==== MISCELLANEOUS CHANGES.  Division IV makes
 25 33 several miscellaneous changes to other EDA programs.  The
 25 34 division amends the sales and use tax refund available under
 25 35 the workforce housing tax incentive program.  That refund
 26  1 is available for sales and use tax paid prior to project
 26  2 completion, which is currently defined to mean the first date
 26  3 upon which the average annualized production of finished
 26  4 product for the preceding 90=day period at the manufacturing
 26  5 facility operated by the eligible business is at least 50
 26  6 percent of the initial design capacity of the facility.  The
 26  7 division amends the definition of "project completion" to mean
 26  8 the date on which the EDA notifies the department of revenue
 26  9 that all applicable requirements of a workforce housing tax
 26 10 incentive program agreement are satisfied.  This provision
 26 11 takes effect upon enactment and applies retroactively to July
 26 12 1, 2014, for all workforce housing tax incentive agreements
 26 13 entered into on or after that date.
 26 14    The division allows the EDA to extend the project
 26 15 completion date for a project awarded tax incentives under the
 26 16 redevelopment tax credit program and the housing enterprise
 26 17 zone tax incentives program if the property that is the subject
 26 18 of the project suffered a catastrophic fire during the 2014
 26 19 calendar year.
       LSB 1212HV (3) 86
       mm/sc
 19 10 produced in Iowa from biomass feedstock by the eligible
 19 11 business during the calendar year, measured in pounds, and any
 19 12 other information reasonably required by the EDA in order to
 19 13 establish and verify eligibility under the program.  The EDA
 19 14 may accept applications on a continuous basis or may establish
 19 15 an annual application deadline.
 19 16    Before being issued a tax credit, an eligible business
 19 17 is required to enter into an agreement with the EDA for the
 19 18 successful completion of all requirements of the program.  The
 19 19 EDA is authorized to impose two compliance cost fees under the
 19 20 program.  The first fee equals $500 per agreement.  The second
 19 21 fee equals 0.5 percent of the value of the tax credit claimed
 19 22 pursuant to the agreement if the agreement has an aggregate tax
 19 23 credit value of $100,000 or greater.
 19 24    An eligible business that fails to comply with the
 19 25 requirements of the program or the terms of an agreement with
 19 26 the EDA may have its tax credits reduced, terminated, or
 19 27 rescinded, and may be subject to the repayment or recapture of
 19 28 claimed tax credits.
 19 29    Upon determining that all requirements of an agreement and
 19 30 the program have been fulfilled, the EDA shall issue a tax
 19 31 credit and related tax credit certificate to the eligible
 19 32 business in an amount equal to the product of $.05 multiplied
 19 33 by the number of pounds of renewable chemicals produced in Iowa
 19 34 from biomass feedstock by the eligible business during the
 19 35 calendar year.  Renewable chemicals produced by an eligible
 20  1 business prior to the effective date of the division, or
 20  2 prior to the date the business first qualifies as an eligible
 20  3 business, or after calendar year 2025, shall not qualify for
 20  4 the tax credit.
 20  5    The tax credit shall be claimed for the tax year during
 20  6 which the eligible business was issued the tax credit.  The tax
 20  7 credit may be claimed against the individual income tax and the
 20  8 corporate income tax.  The credit is refundable or may, at the
 20  9 election of the taxpayer, be carried forward for up to one tax
 20 10 year.   The tax credit shall not be transferred to any person.  A
 20 11 tax credit issued to a partnership, limited liability company,
 20 12 S corporation, cooperative organized under Code chapter 501
 20 13 and filing as a partnership for federal tax purposes, estate,
 20 14 or trust electing to have the income taxed directly to the
 20 15 individual may be claimed by the individual based upon the pro
 20 16 rata share of the individual's earnings from that entity.
 20 17    The division provides that the program is subject to the
 20 18 EDA's maximum aggregate tax credit cap of $170 million per
 20 19 fiscal year in Code section 15.119, and not more than $15
 20 20 million per fiscal year may be issued by the EDA under the
 20 21 program.  In addition, the maximum amount of tax credit that
 20 22 may be issued to an eligible business in any one calendar year
 20 23 shall not exceed $1 million or $500,000, depending on whether
 20 24 the eligible business has been operating in Iowa at the time of
 20 25 application for five or fewer years, or more than five years,
 20 26 respectively.  An eligible business shall not receive more than
 20 27 five tax credits under the program.  The EDA is required to
 20 28 issue tax credits on a first=come, first=served basis until the
 20 29 maximum amount of $15 million per fiscal year is reached.  If
 20 30 the amount of tax credits exceeds this amount in a fiscal year,
 20 31 the EDA is required to establish a wait list and give priority
 20 32 in subsequent years to the eligible businesses on the wait
 20 33 list.
 20 34    The division provides for the confidentiality of certain
 20 35 information under the program.  The identity of a tax credit
 21  1 recipient and the amount of the tax credit shall be considered
 21  2 public information under Code chapter 22 (examination of public
 21  3 records), but any other information or record in the possession
 21  4 of the EDA with respect to the program shall be presumed by
 21  5 the EDA to be a trade secret protected under Code chapter 550
 21  6 or common law and shall be kept confidential by the EDA unless
 21  7 otherwise ordered by a court.
 21  8    The division takes effect upon enactment and applies to
 21  9 renewable chemicals produced in Iowa from biomass feedstock on
 21 10 or after that date.  The division applies retroactively to tax
 21 11 years beginning on or after January 1, 2015.
 21 12    DIVISION II ==== ANGEL INVESTOR TAX CREDITS.   Division II
 21 13 makes several changes to the tax credit for investments in
 21 14 qualifying businesses and community=based seed capital funds,
 21 15 often referred to as the angel investor tax credits.  The
 21 16 division amends the purpose of the tax credit in Code section
 21 17 15E.41.  The division excludes investments in community=based
 21 18 seed capital funds from qualifying for the tax credit and
 21 19 makes several conforming amendments to remove references to
 21 20 community=based seed capital funds from the Code.
 21 21    The division modifies the amount and dollar limitation of
 21 22 the tax credit for a taxpayer.  The tax credit is increased
 21 23 from 20 percent to 25 percent of a taxpayer's equity investment
 21 24 in a qualifying business.  Under current law, a taxpayer cannot
 21 25 claim more than $50,000 of tax credit per investment in a
 21 26 qualifying business, and for each tax year a taxpayer and the
 21 27 taxpayer's affiliates cannot claim tax credits for more than
 21 28 five investments in five different qualifying businesses.  The
 21 29 division amends this dollar limitation to prohibit a natural
 21 30 person and the person's spouse, child, or sibling from claiming
 21 31 a combined amount of more than $100,000 in tax credits per tax
 21 32 year.
 21 33    The division also provides that no more than $500,000 in tax
 21 34 credits may be issued per tax year for equity investments in
 21 35 any one qualifying business.
 22  1 The division modifies the procedures for claiming the tax
 22  2 credit.  Under current law, the tax credit is not refundable
 22  3 but available for carryforward for up to five tax years.  The
 22  4 division makes the tax credit refundable for an investment
 22  5 made by a natural person, and for any other person reduces the
 22  6 carryforward period to three years.
 22  7    The division strikes a provision permitting the EDA
 22  8 to cooperate with small business development centers to
 22  9 disseminate information regarding the credits and to develop
 22 10 standard application forms, and requiring the EDA to distribute
 22 11 copies of the application forms to all community=based seed
 22 12 capital funds and potential individual investors.
 22 13    The division modifies the eligibility requirements for
 22 14 qualifying businesses.  The division strikes the requirement
 22 15 that a business have an owner that meets at least one of
 22 16 four qualifications relating to business education or
 22 17 business experience.  The division requires that a business
 22 18 be participating in an entrepreneurial assistance program,
 22 19 as defined in the division, but allows the EDA to waive this
 22 20 requirement if the business establishes that its owners,
 22 21 directors, officers, and employees have an appropriate level
 22 22 of experience such that an entrepreneurial assistance program
 22 23 would not materially change the prospects of the business.
 22 24 The EDA is allowed to consult with outside service providers
 22 25 in considering such a waiver.  The division increases from $5
 22 26 million to $10 million the maximum amount of net worth that
 22 27 a business may have to be considered a qualifying business.
 22 28 The division increases from $250,000 to $500,000 the amount of
 22 29 financing that a business must have in order to be considered a
 22 30 qualifying business, removes "near equity" from the types of
 22 31 financing that will be considered in that calculation, requires
 22 32 that the financing be secured at the time of application for
 22 33 the tax credits, and requires that the business have at least
 22 34 two investors at the time of application for the tax credits.
 22 35 These modified eligibility requirements apply to businesses
 23  1 that submit an application to the EDA to be registered as a
 23  2 qualifying business on or after the effective date of this
 23  3 division of the bill, and businesses that submitted such an
 23  4 application to the EDA before the effective date of this
 23  5 division of the bill shall be governed by current law.
 23  6    The division provides for the confidentiality of certain
 23  7 information with regard to the tax credit.  The identity of
 23  8 a qualifying business, the identity of an investor and the
 23  9 qualifying business in which the investor made an equity
 23 10 investment, and the total number and amount of tax credits
 23 11 issued shall be considered public information under Code
 23 12 chapter 22 (examination of public records), but any other
 23 13 information or record in the possession of the EDA with respect
 23 14 to the program shall be presumed by the EDA to be a trade secret
 23 15 protected under Code chapter 550 or common law and shall be
 23 16 kept confidential by the EDA unless otherwise ordered by a
 23 17 court.
 23 18    The division takes effect upon enactment and applies to
 23 19 equity investments in a qualifying business made on or after
 23 20 that date.  Equity investments in a qualifying business or
 23 21 community=based seed capital fund made prior to the effective
 23 22 date of the division shall be governed by current law.
 23 23    DIVISION III ==== ENTREPRENEUR INVESTMENT AWARDS PROGRAM.
 23 24  Division III amends the entrepreneur investment awards program
 23 25 administered by the EDA.  The division strikes provisions that
 23 26 prohibited the EDA from making awards under the program since
 23 27 July 1, 2014, and that required the EDA by December 31, 2014,
 23 28 to conduct a comprehensive review of the program and submit
 23 29 a report with specified information to the governor and the
 23 30 general assembly.
 23 31    The division modifies the purpose of the program to be
 23 32 to provide financial assistance to eligible entrepreneurial
 23 33 assistance providers (provider) that provide technical and
 23 34 financial assistance to entrepreneurs and start=up companies
 23 35 seeking to create, locate, or expand a business in Iowa.
 24  1 "Financial assistance" is defined in the division.
 24  2    The division changes the requirements for receiving an
 24  3 award.  To be eligible to receive an award under current
 24  4 law, an entrepreneurial assistance program must have been
 24  5 an Iowa=based business, expended at least $500,000 during
 24  6 the previous fiscal year to provide technical and financial
 24  7 assistance services that meet the broad=based needs of
 24  8 entrepreneurs seeking to create, locate, or expand a business
 24  9 in Iowa that intends to derive more than 10 percent of its
 24 10 gross sales from markets outside Iowa; and must have engaged
 24 11 and communicated with certain other programs, funding sources,
 24 12 and entities for its entrepreneur clients.  The division
 24 13 amends the eligibility for receiving financial assistance to
 24 14 require that a provider have its principal place of operations
 24 15 in Iowa and that the provider offer a comprehensive set of
 24 16 business development services to emerging and early=stage
 24 17 innovation companies to assist in the creation, location,
 24 18 growth, and long=term success of the company in Iowa.
 24 19 "Business development services" is defined in the division.
 24 20 Business development services may be performed at the physical
 24 21 location of the provider or the company and may be provided in
 24 22 consideration of equity participation in the company, a fee for
 24 23 services, or a membership agreement with the company.
 24 24    Under current law, the EDA board could approve, deny, or
 24 25 defer each application for a grant, and was required to award
 24 26 grants on a first=come, first=served basis.  The division
 24 27 specifies that the EDA board has the discretion to approve,
 24 28 deny, or defer each application for financial assistance and
 24 29 that the amount of financial assistance awarded to a provider
 24 30 is within the discretion of the EDA.  The division requires
 24 31 the EDA to award financial assistance on a competitive basis
 24 32 and allows the EDA to develop scoring criteria and establish
 24 33 minimum requirements for the receipt of a financial assistance
 24 34 award.
 24 35    In addition to the four factors relating to the provider's
 25  1 professional staff that the EDA may consider under current
 25  2 law in deciding whether to award financial assistance, the
 25  3 division provides that the EDA may also consider the service
 25  4 model and likelihood of success of the provider, the provider's
 25  5 similarity to other successful providers in the country, and
 25  6 the provider's financial need.
 25  7    The division modifies the maximum award amount for a
 25  8 recipient.  Under current law, a grant to an entrepreneur
 25  9 assistance program cannot exceed the lesser of 25 percent of
 25 10 the funds expended by the program during the previous fiscal
 25 11 year, 100 percent of the funds raised from certain persons
 25 12 by the program during the previous fiscal year, or $200,000.
 25 13 The division provides that the amount of financial assistance
 25 14 awarded to any one provider shall not exceed $200,000.
 25 15    The division modifies the permitted use of funds received
 25 16 under the program.  Under current law, grants are only
 25 17 permitted to be used for the purpose of operating costs
 25 18 incurred by the program.  The division specifies that financial
 25 19 assistance awarded to a provider shall only be used for
 25 20 the purpose of operating costs incurred by the provider in
 25 21 the provision of business development services to emerging
 25 22 and early=stage innovation companies in Iowa.  The division
 25 23 further requires that such financial assistance shall not be
 25 24 distributed to owners or investors of the company to which the
 25 25 business development services are being provided and shall not
 25 26 be provided to other persons assisting with the provision of
 25 27 the services.
 25 28    Under current law, an entrepreneurial assistance provider is
 25 29 required to accept client referrals from the EDA as a condition
 25 30 of receiving a grant.  The division provides that the EDA may
 25 31 make client referrals to eligible providers.
 25 32    DIVISION IV ==== MISCELLANEOUS CHANGES.  Division IV makes
 25 33 several miscellaneous changes to other EDA programs.  The
 25 34 division amends the sales and use tax refund available under
 25 35 the workforce housing tax incentive program.  That refund
 26  1 is available for sales and use tax paid prior to project
 26  2 completion, which is currently defined to mean the first date
 26  3 upon which the average annualized production of finished
 26  4 product for the preceding 90=day period at the manufacturing
 26  5 facility operated by the eligible business is at least 50
 26  6 percent of the initial design capacity of the facility.  The
 26  7 division amends the definition of "project completion" to mean
 26  8 the date on which the EDA notifies the department of revenue
 26  9 that all applicable requirements of a workforce housing tax
 26 10 incentive program agreement are satisfied.  This provision
 26 11 takes effect upon enactment and applies retroactively to July
 26 12 1, 2014, for all workforce housing tax incentive agreements
 26 13 entered into on or after that date.
 26 14    The division allows the EDA to extend the project
 26 15 completion date for a project awarded tax incentives under the
 26 16 redevelopment tax credit program and the housing enterprise
 26 17 zone tax incentives program if the property that is the subject
 26 18 of the project suffered a catastrophic fire during the 2014
 26 19 calendar year.
       LSB 1212HV (3) 86
       mm/sc
 19 11 business during the calendar year, measured in pounds, and any
 19 12 other information reasonably required by the EDA in order to
 19 13 establish and verify eligibility under the program.  The EDA
 19 14 may accept applications on a continuous basis or may establish
 19 15 an annual application deadline.
 19 16    Before being issued a tax credit, an eligible business
 19 17 is required to enter into an agreement with the EDA for the
 19 18 successful completion of all requirements of the program.  The
 19 19 EDA is authorized to impose two compliance cost fees under the
 19 20 program.  The first fee equals $500 per agreement.  The second
 19 21 fee equals 0.5 percent of the value of the tax credit claimed
 19 22 pursuant to the agreement if the agreement has an aggregate tax
 19 23 credit value of $100,000 or greater.
 19 24    An eligible business that fails to comply with the
 19 25 requirements of the program or the terms of an agreement with
 19 26 the EDA may have its tax credits reduced, terminated, or
 19 27 rescinded, and may be subject to the repayment or recapture of
 19 28 claimed tax credits.
 19 29    Upon determining that all requirements of an agreement and
 19 30 the program have been fulfilled, the EDA shall issue a tax
 19 31 credit and related tax credit certificate to the eligible
 19 32 business in an amount equal to the product of $.05 multiplied
 19 33 by the number of pounds of renewable chemicals produced in Iowa
 19 34 from biomass feedstock by the eligible business during the
 19 35 calendar year.  Renewable chemicals produced by an eligible
 20  1 business prior to the effective date of the division, or
 20  2 prior to the date the business first qualifies as an eligible
 20  3 business, or after calendar year 2025, shall not qualify for
 20  4 the tax credit.
 20  5    The tax credit shall be claimed for the tax year during
 20  6 which the eligible business was issued the tax credit.  The tax
 20  7 credit may be claimed against the individual income tax and the
 20  8 corporate income tax.  The credit is refundable or may, at the
 20  9 election of the taxpayer, be carried forward for up to one tax
 20 10 year.   The tax credit shall not be transferred to any person.  A
 20 11 tax credit issued to a partnership, limited liability company,
 20 12 S corporation, cooperative organized under Code chapter 501
 20 13 and filing as a partnership for federal tax purposes, estate,
 20 14 or trust electing to have the income taxed directly to the
 20 15 individual may be claimed by the individual based upon the pro
 20 16 rata share of the individual's earnings from that entity.
 20 17    The division provides that the program is subject to the
 20 18 EDA's maximum aggregate tax credit cap of $170 million per
 20 19 fiscal year in Code section 15.119, and not more than $15
 20 20 million per fiscal year may be issued by the EDA under the
 20 21 program.  In addition, the maximum amount of tax credit that
 20 22 may be issued to an eligible business in any one calendar year
 20 23 shall not exceed $1 million or $500,000, depending on whether
 20 24 the eligible business has been operating in Iowa at the time of
 20 25 application for five or fewer years, or more than five years,
 20 26 respectively.  An eligible business shall not receive more than
 20 27 five tax credits under the program.  The EDA is required to
 20 28 issue tax credits on a first=come, first=served basis until the
 20 29 maximum amount of $15 million per fiscal year is reached.  If
 20 30 the amount of tax credits exceeds this amount in a fiscal year,
 20 31 the EDA is required to establish a wait list and give priority
 20 32 in subsequent years to the eligible businesses on the wait
 20 33 list.
 20 34    The division provides for the confidentiality of certain
 20 35 information under the program.  The identity of a tax credit
 21  1 recipient and the amount of the tax credit shall be considered
 21  2 public information under Code chapter 22 (examination of public
 21  3 records), but any other information or record in the possession
 21  4 of the EDA with respect to the program shall be presumed by
 21  5 the EDA to be a trade secret protected under Code chapter 550
 21  6 or common law and shall be kept confidential by the EDA unless
 21  7 otherwise ordered by a court.
 21  8    The division takes effect upon enactment and applies to
 21  9 renewable chemicals produced in Iowa from biomass feedstock on
 21 10 or after that date.  The division applies retroactively to tax
 21 11 years beginning on or after January 1, 2015.
 21 12    DIVISION II ==== ANGEL INVESTOR TAX CREDITS.   Division II
 21 13 makes several changes to the tax credit for investments in
 21 14 qualifying businesses and community=based seed capital funds,
 21 15 often referred to as the angel investor tax credits.  The
 21 16 division amends the purpose of the tax credit in Code section
 21 17 15E.41.  The division excludes investments in community=based
 21 18 seed capital funds from qualifying for the tax credit and
 21 19 makes several conforming amendments to remove references to
 21 20 community=based seed capital funds from the Code.
 21 21    The division modifies the amount and dollar limitation of
 21 22 the tax credit for a taxpayer.  The tax credit is increased
 21 23 from 20 percent to 25 percent of a taxpayer's equity investment
 21 24 in a qualifying business.  Under current law, a taxpayer cannot
 21 25 claim more than $50,000 of tax credit per investment in a
 21 26 qualifying business, and for each tax year a taxpayer and the
 21 27 taxpayer's affiliates cannot claim tax credits for more than
 21 28 five investments in five different qualifying businesses.  The
 21 29 division amends this dollar limitation to prohibit a natural
 21 30 person and the person's spouse, child, or sibling from claiming
 21 31 a combined amount of more than $100,000 in tax credits per tax
 21 32 year.
 21 33    The division also provides that no more than $500,000 in tax
 21 34 credits may be issued per tax year for equity investments in
 21 35 any one qualifying business.
 22  1 The division modifies the procedures for claiming the tax
 22  2 credit.  Under current law, the tax credit is not refundable
 22  3 but available for carryforward for up to five tax years.  The
 22  4 division makes the tax credit refundable for an investment
 22  5 made by a natural person, and for any other person reduces the
 22  6 carryforward period to three years.
 22  7    The division strikes a provision permitting the EDA
 22  8 to cooperate with small business development centers to
 22  9 disseminate information regarding the credits and to develop
 22 10 standard application forms, and requiring the EDA to distribute
 22 11 copies of the application forms to all community=based seed
 22 12 capital funds and potential individual investors.
 22 13    The division modifies the eligibility requirements for
 22 14 qualifying businesses.  The division strikes the requirement
 22 15 that a business have an owner that meets at least one of
 22 16 four qualifications relating to business education or
 22 17 business experience.  The division requires that a business
 22 18 be participating in an entrepreneurial assistance program,
 22 19 as defined in the division, but allows the EDA to waive this
 22 20 requirement if the business establishes that its owners,
 22 21 directors, officers, and employees have an appropriate level
 22 22 of experience such that an entrepreneurial assistance program
 22 23 would not materially change the prospects of the business.
 22 24 The EDA is allowed to consult with outside service providers
 22 25 in considering such a waiver.  The division increases from $5
 22 26 million to $10 million the maximum amount of net worth that
 22 27 a business may have to be considered a qualifying business.
 22 28 The division increases from $250,000 to $500,000 the amount of
 22 29 financing that a business must have in order to be considered a
 22 30 qualifying business, removes "near equity" from the types of
 22 31 financing that will be considered in that calculation, requires
 22 32 that the financing be secured at the time of application for
 22 33 the tax credits, and requires that the business have at least
 22 34 two investors at the time of application for the tax credits.
 22 35 These modified eligibility requirements apply to businesses
 23  1 that submit an application to the EDA to be registered as a
 23  2 qualifying business on or after the effective date of this
 23  3 division of the bill, and businesses that submitted such an
 23  4 application to the EDA before the effective date of this
 23  5 division of the bill shall be governed by current law.
 23  6    The division provides for the confidentiality of certain
 23  7 information with regard to the tax credit.  The identity of
 23  8 a qualifying business, the identity of an investor and the
 23  9 qualifying business in which the investor made an equity
 23 10 investment, and the total number and amount of tax credits
 23 11 issued shall be considered public information under Code
 23 12 chapter 22 (examination of public records), but any other
 23 13 information or record in the possession of the EDA with respect
 23 14 to the program shall be presumed by the EDA to be a trade secret
 23 15 protected under Code chapter 550 or common law and shall be
 23 16 kept confidential by the EDA unless otherwise ordered by a
 23 17 court.
 23 18    The division takes effect upon enactment and applies to
 23 19 equity investments in a qualifying business made on or after
 23 20 that date.  Equity investments in a qualifying business or
 23 21 community=based seed capital fund made prior to the effective
 23 22 date of the division shall be governed by current law.
 23 23    DIVISION III ==== ENTREPRENEUR INVESTMENT AWARDS PROGRAM.
 23 24  Division III amends the entrepreneur investment awards program
 23 25 administered by the EDA.  The division strikes provisions that
 23 26 prohibited the EDA from making awards under the program since
 23 27 July 1, 2014, and that required the EDA by December 31, 2014,
 23 28 to conduct a comprehensive review of the program and submit
 23 29 a report with specified information to the governor and the
 23 30 general assembly.
 23 31    The division modifies the purpose of the program to be
 23 32 to provide financial assistance to eligible entrepreneurial
 23 33 assistance providers (provider) that provide technical and
 23 34 financial assistance to entrepreneurs and start=up companies
 23 35 seeking to create, locate, or expand a business in Iowa.
 24  1 "Financial assistance" is defined in the division.
 24  2    The division changes the requirements for receiving an
 24  3 award.  To be eligible to receive an award under current
 24  4 law, an entrepreneurial assistance program must have been
 24  5 an Iowa=based business, expended at least $500,000 during
 24  6 the previous fiscal year to provide technical and financial
 24  7 assistance services that meet the broad=based needs of
 24  8 entrepreneurs seeking to create, locate, or expand a business
 24  9 in Iowa that intends to derive more than 10 percent of its
 24 10 gross sales from markets outside Iowa; and must have engaged
 24 11 and communicated with certain other programs, funding sources,
 24 12 and entities for its entrepreneur clients.  The division
 24 13 amends the eligibility for receiving financial assistance to
 24 14 require that a provider have its principal place of operations
 24 15 in Iowa and that the provider offer a comprehensive set of
 24 16 business development services to emerging and early=stage
 24 17 innovation companies to assist in the creation, location,
 24 18 growth, and long=term success of the company in Iowa.
 24 19 "Business development services" is defined in the division.
 24 20 Business development services may be performed at the physical
 24 21 location of the provider or the company and may be provided in
 24 22 consideration of equity participation in the company, a fee for
 24 23 services, or a membership agreement with the company.
 24 24    Under current law, the EDA board could approve, deny, or
 24 25 defer each application for a grant, and was required to award
 24 26 grants on a first=come, first=served basis.  The division
 24 27 specifies that the EDA board has the discretion to approve,
 24 28 deny, or defer each application for financial assistance and
 24 29 that the amount of financial assistance awarded to a provider
 24 30 is within the discretion of the EDA.  The division requires
 24 31 the EDA to award financial assistance on a competitive basis
 24 32 and allows the EDA to develop scoring criteria and establish
 24 33 minimum requirements for the receipt of a financial assistance
 24 34 award.
 24 35    In addition to the four factors relating to the provider's
 25  1 professional staff that the EDA may consider under current
 25  2 law in deciding whether to award financial assistance, the
 25  3 division provides that the EDA may also consider the service
 25  4 model and likelihood of success of the provider, the provider's
 25  5 similarity to other successful providers in the country, and
 25  6 the provider's financial need.
 25  7    The division modifies the maximum award amount for a
 25  8 recipient.  Under current law, a grant to an entrepreneur
 25  9 assistance program cannot exceed the lesser of 25 percent of
 25 10 the funds expended by the program during the previous fiscal
 25 11 year, 100 percent of the funds raised from certain persons
 25 12 by the program during the previous fiscal year, or $200,000.
 25 13 The division provides that the amount of financial assistance
 25 14 awarded to any one provider shall not exceed $200,000.
 25 15    The division modifies the permitted use of funds received
 25 16 under the program.  Under current law, grants are only
 25 17 permitted to be used for the purpose of operating costs
 25 18 incurred by the program.  The division specifies that financial
 25 19 assistance awarded to a provider shall only be used for
 25 20 the purpose of operating costs incurred by the provider in
 25 21 the provision of business development services to emerging
 25 22 and early=stage innovation companies in Iowa.  The division
 25 23 further requires that such financial assistance shall not be
 25 24 distributed to owners or investors of the company to which the
 25 25 business development services are being provided and shall not
 25 26 be provided to other persons assisting with the provision of
 25 27 the services.
 25 28    Under current law, an entrepreneurial assistance provider is
 25 29 required to accept client referrals from the EDA as a condition
 25 30 of receiving a grant.  The division provides that the EDA may
 25 31 make client referrals to eligible providers.
 25 32    DIVISION IV ==== MISCELLANEOUS CHANGES.  Division IV makes
 25 33 several miscellaneous changes to other EDA programs.  The
 25 34 division amends the sales and use tax refund available under
 25 35 the workforce housing tax incentive program.  That refund
 26  1 is available for sales and use tax paid prior to project
 26  2 completion, which is currently defined to mean the first date
 26  3 upon which the average annualized production of finished
 26  4 product for the preceding 90=day period at the manufacturing
 26  5 facility operated by the eligible business is at least 50
 26  6 percent of the initial design capacity of the facility.  The
 26  7 division amends the definition of "project completion" to mean
 26  8 the date on which the EDA notifies the department of revenue
 26  9 that all applicable requirements of a workforce housing tax
 26 10 incentive program agreement are satisfied.  This provision
 26 11 takes effect upon enactment and applies retroactively to July
 26 12 1, 2014, for all workforce housing tax incentive agreements
 26 13 entered into on or after that date.
 26 14    The division allows the EDA to extend the project
 26 15 completion date for a project awarded tax incentives under the
 26 16 redevelopment tax credit program and the housing enterprise
 26 17 zone tax incentives program if the property that is the subject
 26 18 of the project suffered a catastrophic fire during the 2014
 26 19 calendar year.
       LSB 1212HV (3) 86
       mm/sc
 19 12 other information reasonably required by the EDA in order to
 19 13 establish and verify eligibility under the program.  The EDA
 19 14 may accept applications on a continuous basis or may establish
 19 15 an annual application deadline.
 19 16    Before being issued a tax credit, an eligible business
 19 17 is required to enter into an agreement with the EDA for the
 19 18 successful completion of all requirements of the program.  The
 19 19 EDA is authorized to impose two compliance cost fees under the
 19 20 program.  The first fee equals $500 per agreement.  The second
 19 21 fee equals 0.5 percent of the value of the tax credit claimed
 19 22 pursuant to the agreement if the agreement has an aggregate tax
 19 23 credit value of $100,000 or greater.
 19 24    An eligible business that fails to comply with the
 19 25 requirements of the program or the terms of an agreement with
 19 26 the EDA may have its tax credits reduced, terminated, or
 19 27 rescinded, and may be subject to the repayment or recapture of
 19 28 claimed tax credits.
 19 29    Upon determining that all requirements of an agreement and
 19 30 the program have been fulfilled, the EDA shall issue a tax
 19 31 credit and related tax credit certificate to the eligible
 19 32 business in an amount equal to the product of $.05 multiplied
 19 33 by the number of pounds of renewable chemicals produced in Iowa
 19 34 from biomass feedstock by the eligible business during the
 19 35 calendar year.  Renewable chemicals produced by an eligible
 20  1 business prior to the effective date of the division, or
 20  2 prior to the date the business first qualifies as an eligible
 20  3 business, or after calendar year 2025, shall not qualify for
 20  4 the tax credit.
 20  5    The tax credit shall be claimed for the tax year during
 20  6 which the eligible business was issued the tax credit.  The tax
 20  7 credit may be claimed against the individual income tax and the
 20  8 corporate income tax.  The credit is refundable or may, at the
 20  9 election of the taxpayer, be carried forward for up to one tax
 20 10 year.   The tax credit shall not be transferred to any person.  A
 20 11 tax credit issued to a partnership, limited liability company,
 20 12 S corporation, cooperative organized under Code chapter 501
 20 13 and filing as a partnership for federal tax purposes, estate,
 20 14 or trust electing to have the income taxed directly to the
 20 15 individual may be claimed by the individual based upon the pro
 20 16 rata share of the individual's earnings from that entity.
 20 17    The division provides that the program is subject to the
 20 18 EDA's maximum aggregate tax credit cap of $170 million per
 20 19 fiscal year in Code section 15.119, and not more than $15
 20 20 million per fiscal year may be issued by the EDA under the
 20 21 program.  In addition, the maximum amount of tax credit that
 20 22 may be issued to an eligible business in any one calendar year
 20 23 shall not exceed $1 million or $500,000, depending on whether
 20 24 the eligible business has been operating in Iowa at the time of
 20 25 application for five or fewer years, or more than five years,
 20 26 respectively.  An eligible business shall not receive more than
 20 27 five tax credits under the program.  The EDA is required to
 20 28 issue tax credits on a first=come, first=served basis until the
 20 29 maximum amount of $15 million per fiscal year is reached.  If
 20 30 the amount of tax credits exceeds this amount in a fiscal year,
 20 31 the EDA is required to establish a wait list and give priority
 20 32 in subsequent years to the eligible businesses on the wait
 20 33 list.
 20 34    The division provides for the confidentiality of certain
 20 35 information under the program.  The identity of a tax credit
 21  1 recipient and the amount of the tax credit shall be considered
 21  2 public information under Code chapter 22 (examination of public
 21  3 records), but any other information or record in the possession
 21  4 of the EDA with respect to the program shall be presumed by
 21  5 the EDA to be a trade secret protected under Code chapter 550
 21  6 or common law and shall be kept confidential by the EDA unless
 21  7 otherwise ordered by a court.
 21  8    The division takes effect upon enactment and applies to
 21  9 renewable chemicals produced in Iowa from biomass feedstock on
 21 10 or after that date.  The division applies retroactively to tax
 21 11 years beginning on or after January 1, 2015.
 21 12    DIVISION II ==== ANGEL INVESTOR TAX CREDITS.   Division II
 21 13 makes several changes to the tax credit for investments in
 21 14 qualifying businesses and community=based seed capital funds,
 21 15 often referred to as the angel investor tax credits.  The
 21 16 division amends the purpose of the tax credit in Code section
 21 17 15E.41.  The division excludes investments in community=based
 21 18 seed capital funds from qualifying for the tax credit and
 21 19 makes several conforming amendments to remove references to
 21 20 community=based seed capital funds from the Code.
 21 21    The division modifies the amount and dollar limitation of
 21 22 the tax credit for a taxpayer.  The tax credit is increased
 21 23 from 20 percent to 25 percent of a taxpayer's equity investment
 21 24 in a qualifying business.  Under current law, a taxpayer cannot
 21 25 claim more than $50,000 of tax credit per investment in a
 21 26 qualifying business, and for each tax year a taxpayer and the
 21 27 taxpayer's affiliates cannot claim tax credits for more than
 21 28 five investments in five different qualifying businesses.  The
 21 29 division amends this dollar limitation to prohibit a natural
 21 30 person and the person's spouse, child, or sibling from claiming
 21 31 a combined amount of more than $100,000 in tax credits per tax
 21 32 year.
 21 33    The division also provides that no more than $500,000 in tax
 21 34 credits may be issued per tax year for equity investments in
 21 35 any one qualifying business.
 22  1 The division modifies the procedures for claiming the tax
 22  2 credit.  Under current law, the tax credit is not refundable
 22  3 but available for carryforward for up to five tax years.  The
 22  4 division makes the tax credit refundable for an investment
 22  5 made by a natural person, and for any other person reduces the
 22  6 carryforward period to three years.
 22  7    The division strikes a provision permitting the EDA
 22  8 to cooperate with small business development centers to
 22  9 disseminate information regarding the credits and to develop
 22 10 standard application forms, and requiring the EDA to distribute
 22 11 copies of the application forms to all community=based seed
 22 12 capital funds and potential individual investors.
 22 13    The division modifies the eligibility requirements for
 22 14 qualifying businesses.  The division strikes the requirement
 22 15 that a business have an owner that meets at least one of
 22 16 four qualifications relating to business education or
 22 17 business experience.  The division requires that a business
 22 18 be participating in an entrepreneurial assistance program,
 22 19 as defined in the division, but allows the EDA to waive this
 22 20 requirement if the business establishes that its owners,
 22 21 directors, officers, and employees have an appropriate level
 22 22 of experience such that an entrepreneurial assistance program
 22 23 would not materially change the prospects of the business.
 22 24 The EDA is allowed to consult with outside service providers
 22 25 in considering such a waiver.  The division increases from $5
 22 26 million to $10 million the maximum amount of net worth that
 22 27 a business may have to be considered a qualifying business.
 22 28 The division increases from $250,000 to $500,000 the amount of
 22 29 financing that a business must have in order to be considered a
 22 30 qualifying business, removes "near equity" from the types of
 22 31 financing that will be considered in that calculation, requires
 22 32 that the financing be secured at the time of application for
 22 33 the tax credits, and requires that the business have at least
 22 34 two investors at the time of application for the tax credits.
 22 35 These modified eligibility requirements apply to businesses
 23  1 that submit an application to the EDA to be registered as a
 23  2 qualifying business on or after the effective date of this
 23  3 division of the bill, and businesses that submitted such an
 23  4 application to the EDA before the effective date of this
 23  5 division of the bill shall be governed by current law.
 23  6    The division provides for the confidentiality of certain
 23  7 information with regard to the tax credit.  The identity of
 23  8 a qualifying business, the identity of an investor and the
 23  9 qualifying business in which the investor made an equity
 23 10 investment, and the total number and amount of tax credits
 23 11 issued shall be considered public information under Code
 23 12 chapter 22 (examination of public records), but any other
 23 13 information or record in the possession of the EDA with respect
 23 14 to the program shall be presumed by the EDA to be a trade secret
 23 15 protected under Code chapter 550 or common law and shall be
 23 16 kept confidential by the EDA unless otherwise ordered by a
 23 17 court.
 23 18    The division takes effect upon enactment and applies to
 23 19 equity investments in a qualifying business made on or after
 23 20 that date.  Equity investments in a qualifying business or
 23 21 community=based seed capital fund made prior to the effective
 23 22 date of the division shall be governed by current law.
 23 23    DIVISION III ==== ENTREPRENEUR INVESTMENT AWARDS PROGRAM.
 23 24  Division III amends the entrepreneur investment awards program
 23 25 administered by the EDA.  The division strikes provisions that
 23 26 prohibited the EDA from making awards under the program since
 23 27 July 1, 2014, and that required the EDA by December 31, 2014,
 23 28 to conduct a comprehensive review of the program and submit
 23 29 a report with specified information to the governor and the
 23 30 general assembly.
 23 31    The division modifies the purpose of the program to be
 23 32 to provide financial assistance to eligible entrepreneurial
 23 33 assistance providers (provider) that provide technical and
 23 34 financial assistance to entrepreneurs and start=up companies
 23 35 seeking to create, locate, or expand a business in Iowa.
 24  1 "Financial assistance" is defined in the division.
 24  2    The division changes the requirements for receiving an
 24  3 award.  To be eligible to receive an award under current
 24  4 law, an entrepreneurial assistance program must have been
 24  5 an Iowa=based business, expended at least $500,000 during
 24  6 the previous fiscal year to provide technical and financial
 24  7 assistance services that meet the broad=based needs of
 24  8 entrepreneurs seeking to create, locate, or expand a business
 24  9 in Iowa that intends to derive more than 10 percent of its
 24 10 gross sales from markets outside Iowa; and must have engaged
 24 11 and communicated with certain other programs, funding sources,
 24 12 and entities for its entrepreneur clients.  The division
 24 13 amends the eligibility for receiving financial assistance to
 24 14 require that a provider have its principal place of operations
 24 15 in Iowa and that the provider offer a comprehensive set of
 24 16 business development services to emerging and early=stage
 24 17 innovation companies to assist in the creation, location,
 24 18 growth, and long=term success of the company in Iowa.
 24 19 "Business development services" is defined in the division.
 24 20 Business development services may be performed at the physical
 24 21 location of the provider or the company and may be provided in
 24 22 consideration of equity participation in the company, a fee for
 24 23 services, or a membership agreement with the company.
 24 24    Under current law, the EDA board could approve, deny, or
 24 25 defer each application for a grant, and was required to award
 24 26 grants on a first=come, first=served basis.  The division
 24 27 specifies that the EDA board has the discretion to approve,
 24 28 deny, or defer each application for financial assistance and
 24 29 that the amount of financial assistance awarded to a provider
 24 30 is within the discretion of the EDA.  The division requires
 24 31 the EDA to award financial assistance on a competitive basis
 24 32 and allows the EDA to develop scoring criteria and establish
 24 33 minimum requirements for the receipt of a financial assistance
 24 34 award.
 24 35    In addition to the four factors relating to the provider's
 25  1 professional staff that the EDA may consider under current
 25  2 law in deciding whether to award financial assistance, the
 25  3 division provides that the EDA may also consider the service
 25  4 model and likelihood of success of the provider, the provider's
 25  5 similarity to other successful providers in the country, and
 25  6 the provider's financial need.
 25  7    The division modifies the maximum award amount for a
 25  8 recipient.  Under current law, a grant to an entrepreneur
 25  9 assistance program cannot exceed the lesser of 25 percent of
 25 10 the funds expended by the program during the previous fiscal
 25 11 year, 100 percent of the funds raised from certain persons
 25 12 by the program during the previous fiscal year, or $200,000.
 25 13 The division provides that the amount of financial assistance
 25 14 awarded to any one provider shall not exceed $200,000.
 25 15    The division modifies the permitted use of funds received
 25 16 under the program.  Under current law, grants are only
 25 17 permitted to be used for the purpose of operating costs
 25 18 incurred by the program.  The division specifies that financial
 25 19 assistance awarded to a provider shall only be used for
 25 20 the purpose of operating costs incurred by the provider in
 25 21 the provision of business development services to emerging
 25 22 and early=stage innovation companies in Iowa.  The division
 25 23 further requires that such financial assistance shall not be
 25 24 distributed to owners or investors of the company to which the
 25 25 business development services are being provided and shall not
 25 26 be provided to other persons assisting with the provision of
 25 27 the services.
 25 28    Under current law, an entrepreneurial assistance provider is
 25 29 required to accept client referrals from the EDA as a condition
 25 30 of receiving a grant.  The division provides that the EDA may
 25 31 make client referrals to eligible providers.
 25 32    DIVISION IV ==== MISCELLANEOUS CHANGES.  Division IV makes
 25 33 several miscellaneous changes to other EDA programs.  The
 25 34 division amends the sales and use tax refund available under
 25 35 the workforce housing tax incentive program.  That refund
 26  1 is available for sales and use tax paid prior to project
 26  2 completion, which is currently defined to mean the first date
 26  3 upon which the average annualized production of finished
 26  4 product for the preceding 90=day period at the manufacturing
 26  5 facility operated by the eligible business is at least 50
 26  6 percent of the initial design capacity of the facility.  The
 26  7 division amends the definition of "project completion" to mean
 26  8 the date on which the EDA notifies the department of revenue
 26  9 that all applicable requirements of a workforce housing tax
 26 10 incentive program agreement are satisfied.  This provision
 26 11 takes effect upon enactment and applies retroactively to July
 26 12 1, 2014, for all workforce housing tax incentive agreements
 26 13 entered into on or after that date.
 26 14    The division allows the EDA to extend the project
 26 15 completion date for a project awarded tax incentives under the
 26 16 redevelopment tax credit program and the housing enterprise
 26 17 zone tax incentives program if the property that is the subject
 26 18 of the project suffered a catastrophic fire during the 2014
 26 19 calendar year.

       mm/sc
 19 13 establish and verify eligibility under the program.  The EDA
 19 14 may accept applications on a continuous basis or may establish
 19 15 an annual application deadline.
 19 16    Before being issued a tax credit, an eligible business
 19 17 is required to enter into an agreement with the EDA for the
 19 18 successful completion of all requirements of the program.  The
 19 19 EDA is authorized to impose two compliance cost fees under the
 19 20 program.  The first fee equals $500 per agreement.  The second
 19 21 fee equals 0.5 percent of the value of the tax credit claimed
 19 22 pursuant to the agreement if the agreement has an aggregate tax
 19 23 credit value of $100,000 or greater.
 19 24    An eligible business that fails to comply with the
 19 25 requirements of the program or the terms of an agreement with
 19 26 the EDA may have its tax credits reduced, terminated, or
 19 27 rescinded, and may be subject to the repayment or recapture of
 19 28 claimed tax credits.
 19 29    Upon determining that all requirements of an agreement and
 19 30 the program have been fulfilled, the EDA shall issue a tax
 19 31 credit and related tax credit certificate to the eligible
 19 32 business in an amount equal to the product of $.05 multiplied
 19 33 by the number of pounds of renewable chemicals produced in Iowa
 19 34 from biomass feedstock by the eligible business during the
 19 35 calendar year.  Renewable chemicals produced by an eligible
 20  1 business prior to the effective date of the division, or
 20  2 prior to the date the business first qualifies as an eligible
 20  3 business, or after calendar year 2025, shall not qualify for
 20  4 the tax credit.
 20  5    The tax credit shall be claimed for the tax year during
 20  6 which the eligible business was issued the tax credit.  The tax
 20  7 credit may be claimed against the individual income tax and the
 20  8 corporate income tax.  The credit is refundable or may, at the
 20  9 election of the taxpayer, be carried forward for up to one tax
 20 10 year.   The tax credit shall not be transferred to any person.  A
 20 11 tax credit issued to a partnership, limited liability company,
 20 12 S corporation, cooperative organized under Code chapter 501
 20 13 and filing as a partnership for federal tax purposes, estate,
 20 14 or trust electing to have the income taxed directly to the
 20 15 individual may be claimed by the individual based upon the pro
 20 16 rata share of the individual's earnings from that entity.
 20 17    The division provides that the program is subject to the
 20 18 EDA's maximum aggregate tax credit cap of $170 million per
 20 19 fiscal year in Code section 15.119, and not more than $15
 20 20 million per fiscal year may be issued by the EDA under the
 20 21 program.  In addition, the maximum amount of tax credit that
 20 22 may be issued to an eligible business in any one calendar year
 20 23 shall not exceed $1 million or $500,000, depending on whether
 20 24 the eligible business has been operating in Iowa at the time of
 20 25 application for five or fewer years, or more than five years,
 20 26 respectively.  An eligible business shall not receive more than
 20 27 five tax credits under the program.  The EDA is required to
 20 28 issue tax credits on a first=come, first=served basis until the
 20 29 maximum amount of $15 million per fiscal year is reached.  If
 20 30 the amount of tax credits exceeds this amount in a fiscal year,
 20 31 the EDA is required to establish a wait list and give priority
 20 32 in subsequent years to the eligible businesses on the wait
 20 33 list.
 20 34    The division provides for the confidentiality of certain
 20 35 information under the program.  The identity of a tax credit
 21  1 recipient and the amount of the tax credit shall be considered
 21  2 public information under Code chapter 22 (examination of public
 21  3 records), but any other information or record in the possession
 21  4 of the EDA with respect to the program shall be presumed by
 21  5 the EDA to be a trade secret protected under Code chapter 550
 21  6 or common law and shall be kept confidential by the EDA unless
 21  7 otherwise ordered by a court.
 21  8    The division takes effect upon enactment and applies to
 21  9 renewable chemicals produced in Iowa from biomass feedstock on
 21 10 or after that date.  The division applies retroactively to tax
 21 11 years beginning on or after January 1, 2015.
 21 12    DIVISION II ==== ANGEL INVESTOR TAX CREDITS.   Division II
 21 13 makes several changes to the tax credit for investments in
 21 14 qualifying businesses and community=based seed capital funds,
 21 15 often referred to as the angel investor tax credits.  The
 21 16 division amends the purpose of the tax credit in Code section
 21 17 15E.41.  The division excludes investments in community=based
 21 18 seed capital funds from qualifying for the tax credit and
 21 19 makes several conforming amendments to remove references to
 21 20 community=based seed capital funds from the Code.
 21 21    The division modifies the amount and dollar limitation of
 21 22 the tax credit for a taxpayer.  The tax credit is increased
 21 23 from 20 percent to 25 percent of a taxpayer's equity investment
 21 24 in a qualifying business.  Under current law, a taxpayer cannot
 21 25 claim more than $50,000 of tax credit per investment in a
 21 26 qualifying business, and for each tax year a taxpayer and the
 21 27 taxpayer's affiliates cannot claim tax credits for more than
 21 28 five investments in five different qualifying businesses.  The
 21 29 division amends this dollar limitation to prohibit a natural
 21 30 person and the person's spouse, child, or sibling from claiming
 21 31 a combined amount of more than $100,000 in tax credits per tax
 21 32 year.
 21 33    The division also provides that no more than $500,000 in tax
 21 34 credits may be issued per tax year for equity investments in
 21 35 any one qualifying business.
 22  1 The division modifies the procedures for claiming the tax
 22  2 credit.  Under current law, the tax credit is not refundable
 22  3 but available for carryforward for up to five tax years.  The
 22  4 division makes the tax credit refundable for an investment
 22  5 made by a natural person, and for any other person reduces the
 22  6 carryforward period to three years.
 22  7    The division strikes a provision permitting the EDA
 22  8 to cooperate with small business development centers to
 22  9 disseminate information regarding the credits and to develop
 22 10 standard application forms, and requiring the EDA to distribute
 22 11 copies of the application forms to all community=based seed
 22 12 capital funds and potential individual investors.
 22 13    The division modifies the eligibility requirements for
 22 14 qualifying businesses.  The division strikes the requirement
 22 15 that a business have an owner that meets at least one of
 22 16 four qualifications relating to business education or
 22 17 business experience.  The division requires that a business
 22 18 be participating in an entrepreneurial assistance program,
 22 19 as defined in the division, but allows the EDA to waive this
 22 20 requirement if the business establishes that its owners,
 22 21 directors, officers, and employees have an appropriate level
 22 22 of experience such that an entrepreneurial assistance program
 22 23 would not materially change the prospects of the business.
 22 24 The EDA is allowed to consult with outside service providers
 22 25 in considering such a waiver.  The division increases from $5
 22 26 million to $10 million the maximum amount of net worth that
 22 27 a business may have to be considered a qualifying business.
 22 28 The division increases from $250,000 to $500,000 the amount of
 22 29 financing that a business must have in order to be considered a
 22 30 qualifying business, removes "near equity" from the types of
 22 31 financing that will be considered in that calculation, requires
 22 32 that the financing be secured at the time of application for
 22 33 the tax credits, and requires that the business have at least
 22 34 two investors at the time of application for the tax credits.
 22 35 These modified eligibility requirements apply to businesses
 23  1 that submit an application to the EDA to be registered as a
 23  2 qualifying business on or after the effective date of this
 23  3 division of the bill, and businesses that submitted such an
 23  4 application to the EDA before the effective date of this
 23  5 division of the bill shall be governed by current law.
 23  6    The division provides for the confidentiality of certain
 23  7 information with regard to the tax credit.  The identity of
 23  8 a qualifying business, the identity of an investor and the
 23  9 qualifying business in which the investor made an equity
 23 10 investment, and the total number and amount of tax credits
 23 11 issued shall be considered public information under Code
 23 12 chapter 22 (examination of public records), but any other
 23 13 information or record in the possession of the EDA with respect
 23 14 to the program shall be presumed by the EDA to be a trade secret
 23 15 protected under Code chapter 550 or common law and shall be
 23 16 kept confidential by the EDA unless otherwise ordered by a
 23 17 court.
 23 18    The division takes effect upon enactment and applies to
 23 19 equity investments in a qualifying business made on or after
 23 20 that date.  Equity investments in a qualifying business or
 23 21 community=based seed capital fund made prior to the effective
 23 22 date of the division shall be governed by current law.
 23 23    DIVISION III ==== ENTREPRENEUR INVESTMENT AWARDS PROGRAM.
 23 24  Division III amends the entrepreneur investment awards program
 23 25 administered by the EDA.  The division strikes provisions that
 23 26 prohibited the EDA from making awards under the program since
 23 27 July 1, 2014, and that required the EDA by December 31, 2014,
 23 28 to conduct a comprehensive review of the program and submit
 23 29 a report with specified information to the governor and the
 23 30 general assembly.
 23 31    The division modifies the purpose of the program to be
 23 32 to provide financial assistance to eligible entrepreneurial
 23 33 assistance providers (provider) that provide technical and
 23 34 financial assistance to entrepreneurs and start=up companies
 23 35 seeking to create, locate, or expand a business in Iowa.
 24  1 "Financial assistance" is defined in the division.
 24  2    The division changes the requirements for receiving an
 24  3 award.  To be eligible to receive an award under current
 24  4 law, an entrepreneurial assistance program must have been
 24  5 an Iowa=based business, expended at least $500,000 during
 24  6 the previous fiscal year to provide technical and financial
 24  7 assistance services that meet the broad=based needs of
 24  8 entrepreneurs seeking to create, locate, or expand a business
 24  9 in Iowa that intends to derive more than 10 percent of its
 24 10 gross sales from markets outside Iowa; and must have engaged
 24 11 and communicated with certain other programs, funding sources,
 24 12 and entities for its entrepreneur clients.  The division
 24 13 amends the eligibility for receiving financial assistance to
 24 14 require that a provider have its principal place of operations
 24 15 in Iowa and that the provider offer a comprehensive set of
 24 16 business development services to emerging and early=stage
 24 17 innovation companies to assist in the creation, location,
 24 18 growth, and long=term success of the company in Iowa.
 24 19 "Business development services" is defined in the division.
 24 20 Business development services may be performed at the physical
 24 21 location of the provider or the company and may be provided in
 24 22 consideration of equity participation in the company, a fee for
 24 23 services, or a membership agreement with the company.
 24 24    Under current law, the EDA board could approve, deny, or
 24 25 defer each application for a grant, and was required to award
 24 26 grants on a first=come, first=served basis.  The division
 24 27 specifies that the EDA board has the discretion to approve,
 24 28 deny, or defer each application for financial assistance and
 24 29 that the amount of financial assistance awarded to a provider
 24 30 is within the discretion of the EDA.  The division requires
 24 31 the EDA to award financial assistance on a competitive basis
 24 32 and allows the EDA to develop scoring criteria and establish
 24 33 minimum requirements for the receipt of a financial assistance
 24 34 award.
 24 35    In addition to the four factors relating to the provider's
 25  1 professional staff that the EDA may consider under current
 25  2 law in deciding whether to award financial assistance, the
 25  3 division provides that the EDA may also consider the service
 25  4 model and likelihood of success of the provider, the provider's
 25  5 similarity to other successful providers in the country, and
 25  6 the provider's financial need.
 25  7    The division modifies the maximum award amount for a
 25  8 recipient.  Under current law, a grant to an entrepreneur
 25  9 assistance program cannot exceed the lesser of 25 percent of
 25 10 the funds expended by the program during the previous fiscal
 25 11 year, 100 percent of the funds raised from certain persons
 25 12 by the program during the previous fiscal year, or $200,000.
 25 13 The division provides that the amount of financial assistance
 25 14 awarded to any one provider shall not exceed $200,000.
 25 15    The division modifies the permitted use of funds received
 25 16 under the program.  Under current law, grants are only
 25 17 permitted to be used for the purpose of operating costs
 25 18 incurred by the program.  The division specifies that financial
 25 19 assistance awarded to a provider shall only be used for
 25 20 the purpose of operating costs incurred by the provider in
 25 21 the provision of business development services to emerging
 25 22 and early=stage innovation companies in Iowa.  The division
 25 23 further requires that such financial assistance shall not be
 25 24 distributed to owners or investors of the company to which the
 25 25 business development services are being provided and shall not
 25 26 be provided to other persons assisting with the provision of
 25 27 the services.
 25 28    Under current law, an entrepreneurial assistance provider is
 25 29 required to accept client referrals from the EDA as a condition
 25 30 of receiving a grant.  The division provides that the EDA may
 25 31 make client referrals to eligible providers.
 25 32    DIVISION IV ==== MISCELLANEOUS CHANGES.  Division IV makes
 25 33 several miscellaneous changes to other EDA programs.  The
 25 34 division amends the sales and use tax refund available under
 25 35 the workforce housing tax incentive program.  That refund
 26  1 is available for sales and use tax paid prior to project
 26  2 completion, which is currently defined to mean the first date
 26  3 upon which the average annualized production of finished
 26  4 product for the preceding 90=day period at the manufacturing
 26  5 facility operated by the eligible business is at least 50
 26  6 percent of the initial design capacity of the facility.  The
 26  7 division amends the definition of "project completion" to mean
 26  8 the date on which the EDA notifies the department of revenue
 26  9 that all applicable requirements of a workforce housing tax
 26 10 incentive program agreement are satisfied.  This provision
 26 11 takes effect upon enactment and applies retroactively to July
 26 12 1, 2014, for all workforce housing tax incentive agreements
 26 13 entered into on or after that date.
 26 14    The division allows the EDA to extend the project
 26 15 completion date for a project awarded tax incentives under the
 26 16 redevelopment tax credit program and the housing enterprise
 26 17 zone tax incentives program if the property that is the subject
 26 18 of the project suffered a catastrophic fire during the 2014
 26 19 calendar year.
       LSB 1212HV (3) 86
       mm/sc
 19 14 may accept applications on a continuous basis or may establish
 19 15 an annual application deadline.
 19 16    Before being issued a tax credit, an eligible business
 19 17 is required to enter into an agreement with the EDA for the
 19 18 successful completion of all requirements of the program.  The
 19 19 EDA is authorized to impose two compliance cost fees under the
 19 20 program.  The first fee equals $500 per agreement.  The second
 19 21 fee equals 0.5 percent of the value of the tax credit claimed
 19 22 pursuant to the agreement if the agreement has an aggregate tax
 19 23 credit value of $100,000 or greater.
 19 24    An eligible business that fails to comply with the
 19 25 requirements of the program or the terms of an agreement with
 19 26 the EDA may have its tax credits reduced, terminated, or
 19 27 rescinded, and may be subject to the repayment or recapture of
 19 28 claimed tax credits.
 19 29    Upon determining that all requirements of an agreement and
 19 30 the program have been fulfilled, the EDA shall issue a tax
 19 31 credit and related tax credit certificate to the eligible
 19 32 business in an amount equal to the product of $.05 multiplied
 19 33 by the number of pounds of renewable chemicals produced in Iowa
 19 34 from biomass feedstock by the eligible business during the
 19 35 calendar year.  Renewable chemicals produced by an eligible
 20  1 business prior to the effective date of the division, or
 20  2 prior to the date the business first qualifies as an eligible
 20  3 business, or after calendar year 2025, shall not qualify for
 20  4 the tax credit.
 20  5    The tax credit shall be claimed for the tax year during
 20  6 which the eligible business was issued the tax credit.  The tax
 20  7 credit may be claimed against the individual income tax and the
 20  8 corporate income tax.  The credit is refundable or may, at the
 20  9 election of the taxpayer, be carried forward for up to one tax
 20 10 year.   The tax credit shall not be transferred to any person.  A
 20 11 tax credit issued to a partnership, limited liability company,
 20 12 S corporation, cooperative organized under Code chapter 501
 20 13 and filing as a partnership for federal tax purposes, estate,
 20 14 or trust electing to have the income taxed directly to the
 20 15 individual may be claimed by the individual based upon the pro
 20 16 rata share of the individual's earnings from that entity.
 20 17    The division provides that the program is subject to the
 20 18 EDA's maximum aggregate tax credit cap of $170 million per
 20 19 fiscal year in Code section 15.119, and not more than $15
 20 20 million per fiscal year may be issued by the EDA under the
 20 21 program.  In addition, the maximum amount of tax credit that
 20 22 may be issued to an eligible business in any one calendar year
 20 23 shall not exceed $1 million or $500,000, depending on whether
 20 24 the eligible business has been operating in Iowa at the time of
 20 25 application for five or fewer years, or more than five years,
 20 26 respectively.  An eligible business shall not receive more than
 20 27 five tax credits under the program.  The EDA is required to
 20 28 issue tax credits on a first=come, first=served basis until the
 20 29 maximum amount of $15 million per fiscal year is reached.  If
 20 30 the amount of tax credits exceeds this amount in a fiscal year,
 20 31 the EDA is required to establish a wait list and give priority
 20 32 in subsequent years to the eligible businesses on the wait
 20 33 list.
 20 34    The division provides for the confidentiality of certain
 20 35 information under the program.  The identity of a tax credit
 21  1 recipient and the amount of the tax credit shall be considered
 21  2 public information under Code chapter 22 (examination of public
 21  3 records), but any other information or record in the possession
 21  4 of the EDA with respect to the program shall be presumed by
 21  5 the EDA to be a trade secret protected under Code chapter 550
 21  6 or common law and shall be kept confidential by the EDA unless
 21  7 otherwise ordered by a court.
 21  8    The division takes effect upon enactment and applies to
 21  9 renewable chemicals produced in Iowa from biomass feedstock on
 21 10 or after that date.  The division applies retroactively to tax
 21 11 years beginning on or after January 1, 2015.
 21 12    DIVISION II ==== ANGEL INVESTOR TAX CREDITS.   Division II
 21 13 makes several changes to the tax credit for investments in
 21 14 qualifying businesses and community=based seed capital funds,
 21 15 often referred to as the angel investor tax credits.  The
 21 16 division amends the purpose of the tax credit in Code section
 21 17 15E.41.  The division excludes investments in community=based
 21 18 seed capital funds from qualifying for the tax credit and
 21 19 makes several conforming amendments to remove references to
 21 20 community=based seed capital funds from the Code.
 21 21    The division modifies the amount and dollar limitation of
 21 22 the tax credit for a taxpayer.  The tax credit is increased
 21 23 from 20 percent to 25 percent of a taxpayer's equity investment
 21 24 in a qualifying business.  Under current law, a taxpayer cannot
 21 25 claim more than $50,000 of tax credit per investment in a
 21 26 qualifying business, and for each tax year a taxpayer and the
 21 27 taxpayer's affiliates cannot claim tax credits for more than
 21 28 five investments in five different qualifying businesses.  The
 21 29 division amends this dollar limitation to prohibit a natural
 21 30 person and the person's spouse, child, or sibling from claiming
 21 31 a combined amount of more than $100,000 in tax credits per tax
 21 32 year.
 21 33    The division also provides that no more than $500,000 in tax
 21 34 credits may be issued per tax year for equity investments in
 21 35 any one qualifying business.
 22  1 The division modifies the procedures for claiming the tax
 22  2 credit.  Under current law, the tax credit is not refundable
 22  3 but available for carryforward for up to five tax years.  The
 22  4 division makes the tax credit refundable for an investment
 22  5 made by a natural person, and for any other person reduces the
 22  6 carryforward period to three years.
 22  7    The division strikes a provision permitting the EDA
 22  8 to cooperate with small business development centers to
 22  9 disseminate information regarding the credits and to develop
 22 10 standard application forms, and requiring the EDA to distribute
 22 11 copies of the application forms to all community=based seed
 22 12 capital funds and potential individual investors.
 22 13    The division modifies the eligibility requirements for
 22 14 qualifying businesses.  The division strikes the requirement
 22 15 that a business have an owner that meets at least one of
 22 16 four qualifications relating to business education or
 22 17 business experience.  The division requires that a business
 22 18 be participating in an entrepreneurial assistance program,
 22 19 as defined in the division, but allows the EDA to waive this
 22 20 requirement if the business establishes that its owners,
 22 21 directors, officers, and employees have an appropriate level
 22 22 of experience such that an entrepreneurial assistance program
 22 23 would not materially change the prospects of the business.
 22 24 The EDA is allowed to consult with outside service providers
 22 25 in considering such a waiver.  The division increases from $5
 22 26 million to $10 million the maximum amount of net worth that
 22 27 a business may have to be considered a qualifying business.
 22 28 The division increases from $250,000 to $500,000 the amount of
 22 29 financing that a business must have in order to be considered a
 22 30 qualifying business, removes "near equity" from the types of
 22 31 financing that will be considered in that calculation, requires
 22 32 that the financing be secured at the time of application for
 22 33 the tax credits, and requires that the business have at least
 22 34 two investors at the time of application for the tax credits.
 22 35 These modified eligibility requirements apply to businesses
 23  1 that submit an application to the EDA to be registered as a
 23  2 qualifying business on or after the effective date of this
 23  3 division of the bill, and businesses that submitted such an
 23  4 application to the EDA before the effective date of this
 23  5 division of the bill shall be governed by current law.
 23  6    The division provides for the confidentiality of certain
 23  7 information with regard to the tax credit.  The identity of
 23  8 a qualifying business, the identity of an investor and the
 23  9 qualifying business in which the investor made an equity
 23 10 investment, and the total number and amount of tax credits
 23 11 issued shall be considered public information under Code
 23 12 chapter 22 (examination of public records), but any other
 23 13 information or record in the possession of the EDA with respect
 23 14 to the program shall be presumed by the EDA to be a trade secret
 23 15 protected under Code chapter 550 or common law and shall be
 23 16 kept confidential by the EDA unless otherwise ordered by a
 23 17 court.
 23 18    The division takes effect upon enactment and applies to
 23 19 equity investments in a qualifying business made on or after
 23 20 that date.  Equity investments in a qualifying business or
 23 21 community=based seed capital fund made prior to the effective
 23 22 date of the division shall be governed by current law.
 23 23    DIVISION III ==== ENTREPRENEUR INVESTMENT AWARDS PROGRAM.
 23 24  Division III amends the entrepreneur investment awards program
 23 25 administered by the EDA.  The division strikes provisions that
 23 26 prohibited the EDA from making awards under the program since
 23 27 July 1, 2014, and that required the EDA by December 31, 2014,
 23 28 to conduct a comprehensive review of the program and submit
 23 29 a report with specified information to the governor and the
 23 30 general assembly.
 23 31    The division modifies the purpose of the program to be
 23 32 to provide financial assistance to eligible entrepreneurial
 23 33 assistance providers (provider) that provide technical and
 23 34 financial assistance to entrepreneurs and start=up companies
 23 35 seeking to create, locate, or expand a business in Iowa.
 24  1 "Financial assistance" is defined in the division.
 24  2    The division changes the requirements for receiving an
 24  3 award.  To be eligible to receive an award under current
 24  4 law, an entrepreneurial assistance program must have been
 24  5 an Iowa=based business, expended at least $500,000 during
 24  6 the previous fiscal year to provide technical and financial
 24  7 assistance services that meet the broad=based needs of
 24  8 entrepreneurs seeking to create, locate, or expand a business
 24  9 in Iowa that intends to derive more than 10 percent of its
 24 10 gross sales from markets outside Iowa; and must have engaged
 24 11 and communicated with certain other programs, funding sources,
 24 12 and entities for its entrepreneur clients.  The division
 24 13 amends the eligibility for receiving financial assistance to
 24 14 require that a provider have its principal place of operations
 24 15 in Iowa and that the provider offer a comprehensive set of
 24 16 business development services to emerging and early=stage
 24 17 innovation companies to assist in the creation, location,
 24 18 growth, and long=term success of the company in Iowa.
 24 19 "Business development services" is defined in the division.
 24 20 Business development services may be performed at the physical
 24 21 location of the provider or the company and may be provided in
 24 22 consideration of equity participation in the company, a fee for
 24 23 services, or a membership agreement with the company.
 24 24    Under current law, the EDA board could approve, deny, or
 24 25 defer each application for a grant, and was required to award
 24 26 grants on a first=come, first=served basis.  The division
 24 27 specifies that the EDA board has the discretion to approve,
 24 28 deny, or defer each application for financial assistance and
 24 29 that the amount of financial assistance awarded to a provider
 24 30 is within the discretion of the EDA.  The division requires
 24 31 the EDA to award financial assistance on a competitive basis
 24 32 and allows the EDA to develop scoring criteria and establish
 24 33 minimum requirements for the receipt of a financial assistance
 24 34 award.
 24 35    In addition to the four factors relating to the provider's
 25  1 professional staff that the EDA may consider under current
 25  2 law in deciding whether to award financial assistance, the
 25  3 division provides that the EDA may also consider the service
 25  4 model and likelihood of success of the provider, the provider's
 25  5 similarity to other successful providers in the country, and
 25  6 the provider's financial need.
 25  7    The division modifies the maximum award amount for a
 25  8 recipient.  Under current law, a grant to an entrepreneur
 25  9 assistance program cannot exceed the lesser of 25 percent of
 25 10 the funds expended by the program during the previous fiscal
 25 11 year, 100 percent of the funds raised from certain persons
 25 12 by the program during the previous fiscal year, or $200,000.
 25 13 The division provides that the amount of financial assistance
 25 14 awarded to any one provider shall not exceed $200,000.
 25 15    The division modifies the permitted use of funds received
 25 16 under the program.  Under current law, grants are only
 25 17 permitted to be used for the purpose of operating costs
 25 18 incurred by the program.  The division specifies that financial
 25 19 assistance awarded to a provider shall only be used for
 25 20 the purpose of operating costs incurred by the provider in
 25 21 the provision of business development services to emerging
 25 22 and early=stage innovation companies in Iowa.  The division
 25 23 further requires that such financial assistance shall not be
 25 24 distributed to owners or investors of the company to which the
 25 25 business development services are being provided and shall not
 25 26 be provided to other persons assisting with the provision of
 25 27 the services.
 25 28    Under current law, an entrepreneurial assistance provider is
 25 29 required to accept client referrals from the EDA as a condition
 25 30 of receiving a grant.  The division provides that the EDA may
 25 31 make client referrals to eligible providers.
 25 32    DIVISION IV ==== MISCELLANEOUS CHANGES.  Division IV makes
 25 33 several miscellaneous changes to other EDA programs.  The
 25 34 division amends the sales and use tax refund available under
 25 35 the workforce housing tax incentive program.  That refund
 26  1 is available for sales and use tax paid prior to project
 26  2 completion, which is currently defined to mean the first date
 26  3 upon which the average annualized production of finished
 26  4 product for the preceding 90=day period at the manufacturing
 26  5 facility operated by the eligible business is at least 50
 26  6 percent of the initial design capacity of the facility.  The
 26  7 division amends the definition of "project completion" to mean
 26  8 the date on which the EDA notifies the department of revenue
 26  9 that all applicable requirements of a workforce housing tax
 26 10 incentive program agreement are satisfied.  This provision
 26 11 takes effect upon enactment and applies retroactively to July
 26 12 1, 2014, for all workforce housing tax incentive agreements
 26 13 entered into on or after that date.
 26 14    The division allows the EDA to extend the project
 26 15 completion date for a project awarded tax incentives under the
 26 16 redevelopment tax credit program and the housing enterprise
 26 17 zone tax incentives program if the property that is the subject
 26 18 of the project suffered a catastrophic fire during the 2014
 26 19 calendar year.
       LSB 1212HV (3) 86
       mm/sc
 19 15 an annual application deadline.
 19 16    Before being issued a tax credit, an eligible business
 19 17 is required to enter into an agreement with the EDA for the
 19 18 successful completion of all requirements of the program.  The
 19 19 EDA is authorized to impose two compliance cost fees under the
 19 20 program.  The first fee equals $500 per agreement.  The second
 19 21 fee equals 0.5 percent of the value of the tax credit claimed
 19 22 pursuant to the agreement if the agreement has an aggregate tax
 19 23 credit value of $100,000 or greater.
 19 24    An eligible business that fails to comply with the
 19 25 requirements of the program or the terms of an agreement with
 19 26 the EDA may have its tax credits reduced, terminated, or
 19 27 rescinded, and may be subject to the repayment or recapture of
 19 28 claimed tax credits.
 19 29    Upon determining that all requirements of an agreement and
 19 30 the program have been fulfilled, the EDA shall issue a tax
 19 31 credit and related tax credit certificate to the eligible
 19 32 business in an amount equal to the product of $.05 multiplied
 19 33 by the number of pounds of renewable chemicals produced in Iowa
 19 34 from biomass feedstock by the eligible business during the
 19 35 calendar year.  Renewable chemicals produced by an eligible
 20  1 business prior to the effective date of the division, or
 20  2 prior to the date the business first qualifies as an eligible
 20  3 business, or after calendar year 2025, shall not qualify for
 20  4 the tax credit.
 20  5    The tax credit shall be claimed for the tax year during
 20  6 which the eligible business was issued the tax credit.  The tax
 20  7 credit may be claimed against the individual income tax and the
 20  8 corporate income tax.  The credit is refundable or may, at the
 20  9 election of the taxpayer, be carried forward for up to one tax
 20 10 year.   The tax credit shall not be transferred to any person.  A
 20 11 tax credit issued to a partnership, limited liability company,
 20 12 S corporation, cooperative organized under Code chapter 501
 20 13 and filing as a partnership for federal tax purposes, estate,
 20 14 or trust electing to have the income taxed directly to the
 20 15 individual may be claimed by the individual based upon the pro
 20 16 rata share of the individual's earnings from that entity.
 20 17    The division provides that the program is subject to the
 20 18 EDA's maximum aggregate tax credit cap of $170 million per
 20 19 fiscal year in Code section 15.119, and not more than $15
 20 20 million per fiscal year may be issued by the EDA under the
 20 21 program.  In addition, the maximum amount of tax credit that
 20 22 may be issued to an eligible business in any one calendar year
 20 23 shall not exceed $1 million or $500,000, depending on whether
 20 24 the eligible business has been operating in Iowa at the time of
 20 25 application for five or fewer years, or more than five years,
 20 26 respectively.  An eligible business shall not receive more than
 20 27 five tax credits under the program.  The EDA is required to
 20 28 issue tax credits on a first=come, first=served basis until the
 20 29 maximum amount of $15 million per fiscal year is reached.  If
 20 30 the amount of tax credits exceeds this amount in a fiscal year,
 20 31 the EDA is required to establish a wait list and give priority
 20 32 in subsequent years to the eligible businesses on the wait
 20 33 list.
 20 34    The division provides for the confidentiality of certain
 20 35 information under the program.  The identity of a tax credit
 21  1 recipient and the amount of the tax credit shall be considered
 21  2 public information under Code chapter 22 (examination of public
 21  3 records), but any other information or record in the possession
 21  4 of the EDA with respect to the program shall be presumed by
 21  5 the EDA to be a trade secret protected under Code chapter 550
 21  6 or common law and shall be kept confidential by the EDA unless
 21  7 otherwise ordered by a court.
 21  8    The division takes effect upon enactment and applies to
 21  9 renewable chemicals produced in Iowa from biomass feedstock on
 21 10 or after that date.  The division applies retroactively to tax
 21 11 years beginning on or after January 1, 2015.
 21 12    DIVISION II ==== ANGEL INVESTOR TAX CREDITS.   Division II
 21 13 makes several changes to the tax credit for investments in
 21 14 qualifying businesses and community=based seed capital funds,
 21 15 often referred to as the angel investor tax credits.  The
 21 16 division amends the purpose of the tax credit in Code section
 21 17 15E.41.  The division excludes investments in community=based
 21 18 seed capital funds from qualifying for the tax credit and
 21 19 makes several conforming amendments to remove references to
 21 20 community=based seed capital funds from the Code.
 21 21    The division modifies the amount and dollar limitation of
 21 22 the tax credit for a taxpayer.  The tax credit is increased
 21 23 from 20 percent to 25 percent of a taxpayer's equity investment
 21 24 in a qualifying business.  Under current law, a taxpayer cannot
 21 25 claim more than $50,000 of tax credit per investment in a
 21 26 qualifying business, and for each tax year a taxpayer and the
 21 27 taxpayer's affiliates cannot claim tax credits for more than
 21 28 five investments in five different qualifying businesses.  The
 21 29 division amends this dollar limitation to prohibit a natural
 21 30 person and the person's spouse, child, or sibling from claiming
 21 31 a combined amount of more than $100,000 in tax credits per tax
 21 32 year.
 21 33    The division also provides that no more than $500,000 in tax
 21 34 credits may be issued per tax year for equity investments in
 21 35 any one qualifying business.
 22  1 The division modifies the procedures for claiming the tax
 22  2 credit.  Under current law, the tax credit is not refundable
 22  3 but available for carryforward for up to five tax years.  The
 22  4 division makes the tax credit refundable for an investment
 22  5 made by a natural person, and for any other person reduces the
 22  6 carryforward period to three years.
 22  7    The division strikes a provision permitting the EDA
 22  8 to cooperate with small business development centers to
 22  9 disseminate information regarding the credits and to develop
 22 10 standard application forms, and requiring the EDA to distribute
 22 11 copies of the application forms to all community=based seed
 22 12 capital funds and potential individual investors.
 22 13    The division modifies the eligibility requirements for
 22 14 qualifying businesses.  The division strikes the requirement
 22 15 that a business have an owner that meets at least one of
 22 16 four qualifications relating to business education or
 22 17 business experience.  The division requires that a business
 22 18 be participating in an entrepreneurial assistance program,
 22 19 as defined in the division, but allows the EDA to waive this
 22 20 requirement if the business establishes that its owners,
 22 21 directors, officers, and employees have an appropriate level
 22 22 of experience such that an entrepreneurial assistance program
 22 23 would not materially change the prospects of the business.
 22 24 The EDA is allowed to consult with outside service providers
 22 25 in considering such a waiver.  The division increases from $5
 22 26 million to $10 million the maximum amount of net worth that
 22 27 a business may have to be considered a qualifying business.
 22 28 The division increases from $250,000 to $500,000 the amount of
 22 29 financing that a business must have in order to be considered a
 22 30 qualifying business, removes "near equity" from the types of
 22 31 financing that will be considered in that calculation, requires
 22 32 that the financing be secured at the time of application for
 22 33 the tax credits, and requires that the business have at least
 22 34 two investors at the time of application for the tax credits.
 22 35 These modified eligibility requirements apply to businesses
 23  1 that submit an application to the EDA to be registered as a
 23  2 qualifying business on or after the effective date of this
 23  3 division of the bill, and businesses that submitted such an
 23  4 application to the EDA before the effective date of this
 23  5 division of the bill shall be governed by current law.
 23  6    The division provides for the confidentiality of certain
 23  7 information with regard to the tax credit.  The identity of
 23  8 a qualifying business, the identity of an investor and the
 23  9 qualifying business in which the investor made an equity
 23 10 investment, and the total number and amount of tax credits
 23 11 issued shall be considered public information under Code
 23 12 chapter 22 (examination of public records), but any other
 23 13 information or record in the possession of the EDA with respect
 23 14 to the program shall be presumed by the EDA to be a trade secret
 23 15 protected under Code chapter 550 or common law and shall be
 23 16 kept confidential by the EDA unless otherwise ordered by a
 23 17 court.
 23 18    The division takes effect upon enactment and applies to
 23 19 equity investments in a qualifying business made on or after
 23 20 that date.  Equity investments in a qualifying business or
 23 21 community=based seed capital fund made prior to the effective
 23 22 date of the division shall be governed by current law.
 23 23    DIVISION III ==== ENTREPRENEUR INVESTMENT AWARDS PROGRAM.
 23 24  Division III amends the entrepreneur investment awards program
 23 25 administered by the EDA.  The division strikes provisions that
 23 26 prohibited the EDA from making awards under the program since
 23 27 July 1, 2014, and that required the EDA by December 31, 2014,
 23 28 to conduct a comprehensive review of the program and submit
 23 29 a report with specified information to the governor and the
 23 30 general assembly.
 23 31    The division modifies the purpose of the program to be
 23 32 to provide financial assistance to eligible entrepreneurial
 23 33 assistance providers (provider) that provide technical and
 23 34 financial assistance to entrepreneurs and start=up companies
 23 35 seeking to create, locate, or expand a business in Iowa.
 24  1 "Financial assistance" is defined in the division.
 24  2    The division changes the requirements for receiving an
 24  3 award.  To be eligible to receive an award under current
 24  4 law, an entrepreneurial assistance program must have been
 24  5 an Iowa=based business, expended at least $500,000 during
 24  6 the previous fiscal year to provide technical and financial
 24  7 assistance services that meet the broad=based needs of
 24  8 entrepreneurs seeking to create, locate, or expand a business
 24  9 in Iowa that intends to derive more than 10 percent of its
 24 10 gross sales from markets outside Iowa; and must have engaged
 24 11 and communicated with certain other programs, funding sources,
 24 12 and entities for its entrepreneur clients.  The division
 24 13 amends the eligibility for receiving financial assistance to
 24 14 require that a provider have its principal place of operations
 24 15 in Iowa and that the provider offer a comprehensive set of
 24 16 business development services to emerging and early=stage
 24 17 innovation companies to assist in the creation, location,
 24 18 growth, and long=term success of the company in Iowa.
 24 19 "Business development services" is defined in the division.
 24 20 Business development services may be performed at the physical
 24 21 location of the provider or the company and may be provided in
 24 22 consideration of equity participation in the company, a fee for
 24 23 services, or a membership agreement with the company.
 24 24    Under current law, the EDA board could approve, deny, or
 24 25 defer each application for a grant, and was required to award
 24 26 grants on a first=come, first=served basis.  The division
 24 27 specifies that the EDA board has the discretion to approve,
 24 28 deny, or defer each application for financial assistance and
 24 29 that the amount of financial assistance awarded to a provider
 24 30 is within the discretion of the EDA.  The division requires
 24 31 the EDA to award financial assistance on a competitive basis
 24 32 and allows the EDA to develop scoring criteria and establish
 24 33 minimum requirements for the receipt of a financial assistance
 24 34 award.
 24 35    In addition to the four factors relating to the provider's
 25  1 professional staff that the EDA may consider under current
 25  2 law in deciding whether to award financial assistance, the
 25  3 division provides that the EDA may also consider the service
 25  4 model and likelihood of success of the provider, the provider's
 25  5 similarity to other successful providers in the country, and
 25  6 the provider's financial need.
 25  7    The division modifies the maximum award amount for a
 25  8 recipient.  Under current law, a grant to an entrepreneur
 25  9 assistance program cannot exceed the lesser of 25 percent of
 25 10 the funds expended by the program during the previous fiscal
 25 11 year, 100 percent of the funds raised from certain persons
 25 12 by the program during the previous fiscal year, or $200,000.
 25 13 The division provides that the amount of financial assistance
 25 14 awarded to any one provider shall not exceed $200,000.
 25 15    The division modifies the permitted use of funds received
 25 16 under the program.  Under current law, grants are only
 25 17 permitted to be used for the purpose of operating costs
 25 18 incurred by the program.  The division specifies that financial
 25 19 assistance awarded to a provider shall only be used for
 25 20 the purpose of operating costs incurred by the provider in
 25 21 the provision of business development services to emerging
 25 22 and early=stage innovation companies in Iowa.  The division
 25 23 further requires that such financial assistance shall not be
 25 24 distributed to owners or investors of the company to which the
 25 25 business development services are being provided and shall not
 25 26 be provided to other persons assisting with the provision of
 25 27 the services.
 25 28    Under current law, an entrepreneurial assistance provider is
 25 29 required to accept client referrals from the EDA as a condition
 25 30 of receiving a grant.  The division provides that the EDA may
 25 31 make client referrals to eligible providers.
 25 32    DIVISION IV ==== MISCELLANEOUS CHANGES.  Division IV makes
 25 33 several miscellaneous changes to other EDA programs.  The
 25 34 division amends the sales and use tax refund available under
 25 35 the workforce housing tax incentive program.  That refund
 26  1 is available for sales and use tax paid prior to project
 26  2 completion, which is currently defined to mean the first date
 26  3 upon which the average annualized production of finished
 26  4 product for the preceding 90=day period at the manufacturing
 26  5 facility operated by the eligible business is at least 50
 26  6 percent of the initial design capacity of the facility.  The
 26  7 division amends the definition of "project completion" to mean
 26  8 the date on which the EDA notifies the department of revenue
 26  9 that all applicable requirements of a workforce housing tax
 26 10 incentive program agreement are satisfied.  This provision
 26 11 takes effect upon enactment and applies retroactively to July
 26 12 1, 2014, for all workforce housing tax incentive agreements
 26 13 entered into on or after that date.
 26 14    The division allows the EDA to extend the project
 26 15 completion date for a project awarded tax incentives under the
 26 16 redevelopment tax credit program and the housing enterprise
 26 17 zone tax incentives program if the property that is the subject
 26 18 of the project suffered a catastrophic fire during the 2014
 26 19 calendar year.
       LSB 1212HV (3) 86
       mm/sc
 19 16    Before being issued a tax credit, an eligible business
 19 17 is required to enter into an agreement with the EDA for the
 19 18 successful completion of all requirements of the program.  The
 19 19 EDA is authorized to impose two compliance cost fees under the
 19 20 program.  The first fee equals $500 per agreement.  The second
 19 21 fee equals 0.5 percent of the value of the tax credit claimed
 19 22 pursuant to the agreement if the agreement has an aggregate tax
 19 23 credit value of $100,000 or greater.
 19 24    An eligible business that fails to comply with the
 19 25 requirements of the program or the terms of an agreement with
 19 26 the EDA may have its tax credits reduced, terminated, or
 19 27 rescinded, and may be subject to the repayment or recapture of
 19 28 claimed tax credits.
 19 29    Upon determining that all requirements of an agreement and
 19 30 the program have been fulfilled, the EDA shall issue a tax
 19 31 credit and related tax credit certificate to the eligible
 19 32 business in an amount equal to the product of $.05 multiplied
 19 33 by the number of pounds of renewable chemicals produced in Iowa
 19 34 from biomass feedstock by the eligible business during the
 19 35 calendar year.  Renewable chemicals produced by an eligible
 20  1 business prior to the effective date of the division, or
 20  2 prior to the date the business first qualifies as an eligible
 20  3 business, or after calendar year 2025, shall not qualify for
 20  4 the tax credit.
 20  5    The tax credit shall be claimed for the tax year during
 20  6 which the eligible business was issued the tax credit.  The tax
 20  7 credit may be claimed against the individual income tax and the
 20  8 corporate income tax.  The credit is refundable or may, at the
 20  9 election of the taxpayer, be carried forward for up to one tax
 20 10 year.   The tax credit shall not be transferred to any person.  A
 20 11 tax credit issued to a partnership, limited liability company,
 20 12 S corporation, cooperative organized under Code chapter 501
 20 13 and filing as a partnership for federal tax purposes, estate,
 20 14 or trust electing to have the income taxed directly to the
 20 15 individual may be claimed by the individual based upon the pro
 20 16 rata share of the individual's earnings from that entity.
 20 17    The division provides that the program is subject to the
 20 18 EDA's maximum aggregate tax credit cap of $170 million per
 20 19 fiscal year in Code section 15.119, and not more than $15
 20 20 million per fiscal year may be issued by the EDA under the
 20 21 program.  In addition, the maximum amount of tax credit that
 20 22 may be issued to an eligible business in any one calendar year
 20 23 shall not exceed $1 million or $500,000, depending on whether
 20 24 the eligible business has been operating in Iowa at the time of
 20 25 application for five or fewer years, or more than five years,
 20 26 respectively.  An eligible business shall not receive more than
 20 27 five tax credits under the program.  The EDA is required to
 20 28 issue tax credits on a first=come, first=served basis until the
 20 29 maximum amount of $15 million per fiscal year is reached.  If
 20 30 the amount of tax credits exceeds this amount in a fiscal year,
 20 31 the EDA is required to establish a wait list and give priority
 20 32 in subsequent years to the eligible businesses on the wait
 20 33 list.
 20 34    The division provides for the confidentiality of certain
 20 35 information under the program.  The identity of a tax credit
 21  1 recipient and the amount of the tax credit shall be considered
 21  2 public information under Code chapter 22 (examination of public
 21  3 records), but any other information or record in the possession
 21  4 of the EDA with respect to the program shall be presumed by
 21  5 the EDA to be a trade secret protected under Code chapter 550
 21  6 or common law and shall be kept confidential by the EDA unless
 21  7 otherwise ordered by a court.
 21  8    The division takes effect upon enactment and applies to
 21  9 renewable chemicals produced in Iowa from biomass feedstock on
 21 10 or after that date.  The division applies retroactively to tax
 21 11 years beginning on or after January 1, 2015.
 21 12    DIVISION II ==== ANGEL INVESTOR TAX CREDITS.   Division II
 21 13 makes several changes to the tax credit for investments in
 21 14 qualifying businesses and community=based seed capital funds,
 21 15 often referred to as the angel investor tax credits.  The
 21 16 division amends the purpose of the tax credit in Code section
 21 17 15E.41.  The division excludes investments in community=based
 21 18 seed capital funds from qualifying for the tax credit and
 21 19 makes several conforming amendments to remove references to
 21 20 community=based seed capital funds from the Code.
 21 21    The division modifies the amount and dollar limitation of
 21 22 the tax credit for a taxpayer.  The tax credit is increased
 21 23 from 20 percent to 25 percent of a taxpayer's equity investment
 21 24 in a qualifying business.  Under current law, a taxpayer cannot
 21 25 claim more than $50,000 of tax credit per investment in a
 21 26 qualifying business, and for each tax year a taxpayer and the
 21 27 taxpayer's affiliates cannot claim tax credits for more than
 21 28 five investments in five different qualifying businesses.  The
 21 29 division amends this dollar limitation to prohibit a natural
 21 30 person and the person's spouse, child, or sibling from claiming
 21 31 a combined amount of more than $100,000 in tax credits per tax
 21 32 year.
 21 33    The division also provides that no more than $500,000 in tax
 21 34 credits may be issued per tax year for equity investments in
 21 35 any one qualifying business.
 22  1 The division modifies the procedures for claiming the tax
 22  2 credit.  Under current law, the tax credit is not refundable
 22  3 but available for carryforward for up to five tax years.  The
 22  4 division makes the tax credit refundable for an investment
 22  5 made by a natural person, and for any other person reduces the
 22  6 carryforward period to three years.
 22  7    The division strikes a provision permitting the EDA
 22  8 to cooperate with small business development centers to
 22  9 disseminate information regarding the credits and to develop
 22 10 standard application forms, and requiring the EDA to distribute
 22 11 copies of the application forms to all community=based seed
 22 12 capital funds and potential individual investors.
 22 13    The division modifies the eligibility requirements for
 22 14 qualifying businesses.  The division strikes the requirement
 22 15 that a business have an owner that meets at least one of
 22 16 four qualifications relating to business education or
 22 17 business experience.  The division requires that a business
 22 18 be participating in an entrepreneurial assistance program,
 22 19 as defined in the division, but allows the EDA to waive this
 22 20 requirement if the business establishes that its owners,
 22 21 directors, officers, and employees have an appropriate level
 22 22 of experience such that an entrepreneurial assistance program
 22 23 would not materially change the prospects of the business.
 22 24 The EDA is allowed to consult with outside service providers
 22 25 in considering such a waiver.  The division increases from $5
 22 26 million to $10 million the maximum amount of net worth that
 22 27 a business may have to be considered a qualifying business.
 22 28 The division increases from $250,000 to $500,000 the amount of
 22 29 financing that a business must have in order to be considered a
 22 30 qualifying business, removes "near equity" from the types of
 22 31 financing that will be considered in that calculation, requires
 22 32 that the financing be secured at the time of application for
 22 33 the tax credits, and requires that the business have at least
 22 34 two investors at the time of application for the tax credits.
 22 35 These modified eligibility requirements apply to businesses
 23  1 that submit an application to the EDA to be registered as a
 23  2 qualifying business on or after the effective date of this
 23  3 division of the bill, and businesses that submitted such an
 23  4 application to the EDA before the effective date of this
 23  5 division of the bill shall be governed by current law.
 23  6    The division provides for the confidentiality of certain
 23  7 information with regard to the tax credit.  The identity of
 23  8 a qualifying business, the identity of an investor and the
 23  9 qualifying business in which the investor made an equity
 23 10 investment, and the total number and amount of tax credits
 23 11 issued shall be considered public information under Code
 23 12 chapter 22 (examination of public records), but any other
 23 13 information or record in the possession of the EDA with respect
 23 14 to the program shall be presumed by the EDA to be a trade secret
 23 15 protected under Code chapter 550 or common law and shall be
 23 16 kept confidential by the EDA unless otherwise ordered by a
 23 17 court.
 23 18    The division takes effect upon enactment and applies to
 23 19 equity investments in a qualifying business made on or after
 23 20 that date.  Equity investments in a qualifying business or
 23 21 community=based seed capital fund made prior to the effective
 23 22 date of the division shall be governed by current law.
 23 23    DIVISION III ==== ENTREPRENEUR INVESTMENT AWARDS PROGRAM.
 23 24  Division III amends the entrepreneur investment awards program
 23 25 administered by the EDA.  The division strikes provisions that
 23 26 prohibited the EDA from making awards under the program since
 23 27 July 1, 2014, and that required the EDA by December 31, 2014,
 23 28 to conduct a comprehensive review of the program and submit
 23 29 a report with specified information to the governor and the
 23 30 general assembly.
 23 31    The division modifies the purpose of the program to be
 23 32 to provide financial assistance to eligible entrepreneurial
 23 33 assistance providers (provider) that provide technical and
 23 34 financial assistance to entrepreneurs and start=up companies
 23 35 seeking to create, locate, or expand a business in Iowa.
 24  1 "Financial assistance" is defined in the division.
 24  2    The division changes the requirements for receiving an
 24  3 award.  To be eligible to receive an award under current
 24  4 law, an entrepreneurial assistance program must have been
 24  5 an Iowa=based business, expended at least $500,000 during
 24  6 the previous fiscal year to provide technical and financial
 24  7 assistance services that meet the broad=based needs of
 24  8 entrepreneurs seeking to create, locate, or expand a business
 24  9 in Iowa that intends to derive more than 10 percent of its
 24 10 gross sales from markets outside Iowa; and must have engaged
 24 11 and communicated with certain other programs, funding sources,
 24 12 and entities for its entrepreneur clients.  The division
 24 13 amends the eligibility for receiving financial assistance to
 24 14 require that a provider have its principal place of operations
 24 15 in Iowa and that the provider offer a comprehensive set of
 24 16 business development services to emerging and early=stage
 24 17 innovation companies to assist in the creation, location,
 24 18 growth, and long=term success of the company in Iowa.
 24 19 "Business development services" is defined in the division.
 24 20 Business development services may be performed at the physical
 24 21 location of the provider or the company and may be provided in
 24 22 consideration of equity participation in the company, a fee for
 24 23 services, or a membership agreement with the company.
 24 24    Under current law, the EDA board could approve, deny, or
 24 25 defer each application for a grant, and was required to award
 24 26 grants on a first=come, first=served basis.  The division
 24 27 specifies that the EDA board has the discretion to approve,
 24 28 deny, or defer each application for financial assistance and
 24 29 that the amount of financial assistance awarded to a provider
 24 30 is within the discretion of the EDA.  The division requires
 24 31 the EDA to award financial assistance on a competitive basis
 24 32 and allows the EDA to develop scoring criteria and establish
 24 33 minimum requirements for the receipt of a financial assistance
 24 34 award.
 24 35    In addition to the four factors relating to the provider's
 25  1 professional staff that the EDA may consider under current
 25  2 law in deciding whether to award financial assistance, the
 25  3 division provides that the EDA may also consider the service
 25  4 model and likelihood of success of the provider, the provider's
 25  5 similarity to other successful providers in the country, and
 25  6 the provider's financial need.
 25  7    The division modifies the maximum award amount for a
 25  8 recipient.  Under current law, a grant to an entrepreneur
 25  9 assistance program cannot exceed the lesser of 25 percent of
 25 10 the funds expended by the program during the previous fiscal
 25 11 year, 100 percent of the funds raised from certain persons
 25 12 by the program during the previous fiscal year, or $200,000.
 25 13 The division provides that the amount of financial assistance
 25 14 awarded to any one provider shall not exceed $200,000.
 25 15    The division modifies the permitted use of funds received
 25 16 under the program.  Under current law, grants are only
 25 17 permitted to be used for the purpose of operating costs
 25 18 incurred by the program.  The division specifies that financial
 25 19 assistance awarded to a provider shall only be used for
 25 20 the purpose of operating costs incurred by the provider in
 25 21 the provision of business development services to emerging
 25 22 and early=stage innovation companies in Iowa.  The division
 25 23 further requires that such financial assistance shall not be
 25 24 distributed to owners or investors of the company to which the
 25 25 business development services are being provided and shall not
 25 26 be provided to other persons assisting with the provision of
 25 27 the services.
 25 28    Under current law, an entrepreneurial assistance provider is
 25 29 required to accept client referrals from the EDA as a condition
 25 30 of receiving a grant.  The division provides that the EDA may
 25 31 make client referrals to eligible providers.
 25 32    DIVISION IV ==== MISCELLANEOUS CHANGES.  Division IV makes
 25 33 several miscellaneous changes to other EDA programs.  The
 25 34 division amends the sales and use tax refund available under
 25 35 the workforce housing tax incentive program.  That refund
 26  1 is available for sales and use tax paid prior to project
 26  2 completion, which is currently defined to mean the first date
 26  3 upon which the average annualized production of finished
 26  4 product for the preceding 90=day period at the manufacturing
 26  5 facility operated by the eligible business is at least 50
 26  6 percent of the initial design capacity of the facility.  The
 26  7 division amends the definition of "project completion" to mean
 26  8 the date on which the EDA notifies the department of revenue
 26  9 that all applicable requirements of a workforce housing tax
 26 10 incentive program agreement are satisfied.  This provision
 26 11 takes effect upon enactment and applies retroactively to July
 26 12 1, 2014, for all workforce housing tax incentive agreements
 26 13 entered into on or after that date.
 26 14    The division allows the EDA to extend the project
 26 15 completion date for a project awarded tax incentives under the
 26 16 redevelopment tax credit program and the housing enterprise
 26 17 zone tax incentives program if the property that is the subject
 26 18 of the project suffered a catastrophic fire during the 2014
 26 19 calendar year.
       LSB 1212HV (3) 86
       mm/sc
 19 17 is required to enter into an agreement with the EDA for the
 19 18 successful completion of all requirements of the program.  The
 19 19 EDA is authorized to impose two compliance cost fees under the
 19 20 program.  The first fee equals $500 per agreement.  The second
 19 21 fee equals 0.5 percent of the value of the tax credit claimed
 19 22 pursuant to the agreement if the agreement has an aggregate tax
 19 23 credit value of $100,000 or greater.
 19 24    An eligible business that fails to comply with the
 19 25 requirements of the program or the terms of an agreement with
 19 26 the EDA may have its tax credits reduced, terminated, or
 19 27 rescinded, and may be subject to the repayment or recapture of
 19 28 claimed tax credits.
 19 29    Upon determining that all requirements of an agreement and
 19 30 the program have been fulfilled, the EDA shall issue a tax
 19 31 credit and related tax credit certificate to the eligible
 19 32 business in an amount equal to the product of $.05 multiplied
 19 33 by the number of pounds of renewable chemicals produced in Iowa
 19 34 from biomass feedstock by the eligible business during the
 19 35 calendar year.  Renewable chemicals produced by an eligible
 20  1 business prior to the effective date of the division, or
 20  2 prior to the date the business first qualifies as an eligible
 20  3 business, or after calendar year 2025, shall not qualify for
 20  4 the tax credit.
 20  5    The tax credit shall be claimed for the tax year during
 20  6 which the eligible business was issued the tax credit.  The tax
 20  7 credit may be claimed against the individual income tax and the
 20  8 corporate income tax.  The credit is refundable or may, at the
 20  9 election of the taxpayer, be carried forward for up to one tax
 20 10 year.   The tax credit shall not be transferred to any person.  A
 20 11 tax credit issued to a partnership, limited liability company,
 20 12 S corporation, cooperative organized under Code chapter 501
 20 13 and filing as a partnership for federal tax purposes, estate,
 20 14 or trust electing to have the income taxed directly to the
 20 15 individual may be claimed by the individual based upon the pro
 20 16 rata share of the individual's earnings from that entity.
 20 17    The division provides that the program is subject to the
 20 18 EDA's maximum aggregate tax credit cap of $170 million per
 20 19 fiscal year in Code section 15.119, and not more than $15
 20 20 million per fiscal year may be issued by the EDA under the
 20 21 program.  In addition, the maximum amount of tax credit that
 20 22 may be issued to an eligible business in any one calendar year
 20 23 shall not exceed $1 million or $500,000, depending on whether
 20 24 the eligible business has been operating in Iowa at the time of
 20 25 application for five or fewer years, or more than five years,
 20 26 respectively.  An eligible business shall not receive more than
 20 27 five tax credits under the program.  The EDA is required to
 20 28 issue tax credits on a first=come, first=served basis until the
 20 29 maximum amount of $15 million per fiscal year is reached.  If
 20 30 the amount of tax credits exceeds this amount in a fiscal year,
 20 31 the EDA is required to establish a wait list and give priority
 20 32 in subsequent years to the eligible businesses on the wait
 20 33 list.
 20 34    The division provides for the confidentiality of certain
 20 35 information under the program.  The identity of a tax credit
 21  1 recipient and the amount of the tax credit shall be considered
 21  2 public information under Code chapter 22 (examination of public
 21  3 records), but any other information or record in the possession
 21  4 of the EDA with respect to the program shall be presumed by
 21  5 the EDA to be a trade secret protected under Code chapter 550
 21  6 or common law and shall be kept confidential by the EDA unless
 21  7 otherwise ordered by a court.
 21  8    The division takes effect upon enactment and applies to
 21  9 renewable chemicals produced in Iowa from biomass feedstock on
 21 10 or after that date.  The division applies retroactively to tax
 21 11 years beginning on or after January 1, 2015.
 21 12    DIVISION II ==== ANGEL INVESTOR TAX CREDITS.   Division II
 21 13 makes several changes to the tax credit for investments in
 21 14 qualifying businesses and community=based seed capital funds,
 21 15 often referred to as the angel investor tax credits.  The
 21 16 division amends the purpose of the tax credit in Code section
 21 17 15E.41.  The division excludes investments in community=based
 21 18 seed capital funds from qualifying for the tax credit and
 21 19 makes several conforming amendments to remove references to
 21 20 community=based seed capital funds from the Code.
 21 21    The division modifies the amount and dollar limitation of
 21 22 the tax credit for a taxpayer.  The tax credit is increased
 21 23 from 20 percent to 25 percent of a taxpayer's equity investment
 21 24 in a qualifying business.  Under current law, a taxpayer cannot
 21 25 claim more than $50,000 of tax credit per investment in a
 21 26 qualifying business, and for each tax year a taxpayer and the
 21 27 taxpayer's affiliates cannot claim tax credits for more than
 21 28 five investments in five different qualifying businesses.  The
 21 29 division amends this dollar limitation to prohibit a natural
 21 30 person and the person's spouse, child, or sibling from claiming
 21 31 a combined amount of more than $100,000 in tax credits per tax
 21 32 year.
 21 33    The division also provides that no more than $500,000 in tax
 21 34 credits may be issued per tax year for equity investments in
 21 35 any one qualifying business.
 22  1 The division modifies the procedures for claiming the tax
 22  2 credit.  Under current law, the tax credit is not refundable
 22  3 but available for carryforward for up to five tax years.  The
 22  4 division makes the tax credit refundable for an investment
 22  5 made by a natural person, and for any other person reduces the
 22  6 carryforward period to three years.
 22  7    The division strikes a provision permitting the EDA
 22  8 to cooperate with small business development centers to
 22  9 disseminate information regarding the credits and to develop
 22 10 standard application forms, and requiring the EDA to distribute
 22 11 copies of the application forms to all community=based seed
 22 12 capital funds and potential individual investors.
 22 13    The division modifies the eligibility requirements for
 22 14 qualifying businesses.  The division strikes the requirement
 22 15 that a business have an owner that meets at least one of
 22 16 four qualifications relating to business education or
 22 17 business experience.  The division requires that a business
 22 18 be participating in an entrepreneurial assistance program,
 22 19 as defined in the division, but allows the EDA to waive this
 22 20 requirement if the business establishes that its owners,
 22 21 directors, officers, and employees have an appropriate level
 22 22 of experience such that an entrepreneurial assistance program
 22 23 would not materially change the prospects of the business.
 22 24 The EDA is allowed to consult with outside service providers
 22 25 in considering such a waiver.  The division increases from $5
 22 26 million to $10 million the maximum amount of net worth that
 22 27 a business may have to be considered a qualifying business.
 22 28 The division increases from $250,000 to $500,000 the amount of
 22 29 financing that a business must have in order to be considered a
 22 30 qualifying business, removes "near equity" from the types of
 22 31 financing that will be considered in that calculation, requires
 22 32 that the financing be secured at the time of application for
 22 33 the tax credits, and requires that the business have at least
 22 34 two investors at the time of application for the tax credits.
 22 35 These modified eligibility requirements apply to businesses
 23  1 that submit an application to the EDA to be registered as a
 23  2 qualifying business on or after the effective date of this
 23  3 division of the bill, and businesses that submitted such an
 23  4 application to the EDA before the effective date of this
 23  5 division of the bill shall be governed by current law.
 23  6    The division provides for the confidentiality of certain
 23  7 information with regard to the tax credit.  The identity of
 23  8 a qualifying business, the identity of an investor and the
 23  9 qualifying business in which the investor made an equity
 23 10 investment, and the total number and amount of tax credits
 23 11 issued shall be considered public information under Code
 23 12 chapter 22 (examination of public records), but any other
 23 13 information or record in the possession of the EDA with respect
 23 14 to the program shall be presumed by the EDA to be a trade secret
 23 15 protected under Code chapter 550 or common law and shall be
 23 16 kept confidential by the EDA unless otherwise ordered by a
 23 17 court.
 23 18    The division takes effect upon enactment and applies to
 23 19 equity investments in a qualifying business made on or after
 23 20 that date.  Equity investments in a qualifying business or
 23 21 community=based seed capital fund made prior to the effective
 23 22 date of the division shall be governed by current law.
 23 23    DIVISION III ==== ENTREPRENEUR INVESTMENT AWARDS PROGRAM.
 23 24  Division III amends the entrepreneur investment awards program
 23 25 administered by the EDA.  The division strikes provisions that
 23 26 prohibited the EDA from making awards under the program since
 23 27 July 1, 2014, and that required the EDA by December 31, 2014,
 23 28 to conduct a comprehensive review of the program and submit
 23 29 a report with specified information to the governor and the
 23 30 general assembly.
 23 31    The division modifies the purpose of the program to be
 23 32 to provide financial assistance to eligible entrepreneurial
 23 33 assistance providers (provider) that provide technical and
 23 34 financial assistance to entrepreneurs and start=up companies
 23 35 seeking to create, locate, or expand a business in Iowa.
 24  1 "Financial assistance" is defined in the division.
 24  2    The division changes the requirements for receiving an
 24  3 award.  To be eligible to receive an award under current
 24  4 law, an entrepreneurial assistance program must have been
 24  5 an Iowa=based business, expended at least $500,000 during
 24  6 the previous fiscal year to provide technical and financial
 24  7 assistance services that meet the broad=based needs of
 24  8 entrepreneurs seeking to create, locate, or expand a business
 24  9 in Iowa that intends to derive more than 10 percent of its
 24 10 gross sales from markets outside Iowa; and must have engaged
 24 11 and communicated with certain other programs, funding sources,
 24 12 and entities for its entrepreneur clients.  The division
 24 13 amends the eligibility for receiving financial assistance to
 24 14 require that a provider have its principal place of operations
 24 15 in Iowa and that the provider offer a comprehensive set of
 24 16 business development services to emerging and early=stage
 24 17 innovation companies to assist in the creation, location,
 24 18 growth, and long=term success of the company in Iowa.
 24 19 "Business development services" is defined in the division.
 24 20 Business development services may be performed at the physical
 24 21 location of the provider or the company and may be provided in
 24 22 consideration of equity participation in the company, a fee for
 24 23 services, or a membership agreement with the company.
 24 24    Under current law, the EDA board could approve, deny, or
 24 25 defer each application for a grant, and was required to award
 24 26 grants on a first=come, first=served basis.  The division
 24 27 specifies that the EDA board has the discretion to approve,
 24 28 deny, or defer each application for financial assistance and
 24 29 that the amount of financial assistance awarded to a provider
 24 30 is within the discretion of the EDA.  The division requires
 24 31 the EDA to award financial assistance on a competitive basis
 24 32 and allows the EDA to develop scoring criteria and establish
 24 33 minimum requirements for the receipt of a financial assistance
 24 34 award.
 24 35    In addition to the four factors relating to the provider's
 25  1 professional staff that the EDA may consider under current
 25  2 law in deciding whether to award financial assistance, the
 25  3 division provides that the EDA may also consider the service
 25  4 model and likelihood of success of the provider, the provider's
 25  5 similarity to other successful providers in the country, and
 25  6 the provider's financial need.
 25  7    The division modifies the maximum award amount for a
 25  8 recipient.  Under current law, a grant to an entrepreneur
 25  9 assistance program cannot exceed the lesser of 25 percent of
 25 10 the funds expended by the program during the previous fiscal
 25 11 year, 100 percent of the funds raised from certain persons
 25 12 by the program during the previous fiscal year, or $200,000.
 25 13 The division provides that the amount of financial assistance
 25 14 awarded to any one provider shall not exceed $200,000.
 25 15    The division modifies the permitted use of funds received
 25 16 under the program.  Under current law, grants are only
 25 17 permitted to be used for the purpose of operating costs
 25 18 incurred by the program.  The division specifies that financial
 25 19 assistance awarded to a provider shall only be used for
 25 20 the purpose of operating costs incurred by the provider in
 25 21 the provision of business development services to emerging
 25 22 and early=stage innovation companies in Iowa.  The division
 25 23 further requires that such financial assistance shall not be
 25 24 distributed to owners or investors of the company to which the
 25 25 business development services are being provided and shall not
 25 26 be provided to other persons assisting with the provision of
 25 27 the services.
 25 28    Under current law, an entrepreneurial assistance provider is
 25 29 required to accept client referrals from the EDA as a condition
 25 30 of receiving a grant.  The division provides that the EDA may
 25 31 make client referrals to eligible providers.
 25 32    DIVISION IV ==== MISCELLANEOUS CHANGES.  Division IV makes
 25 33 several miscellaneous changes to other EDA programs.  The
 25 34 division amends the sales and use tax refund available under
 25 35 the workforce housing tax incentive program.  That refund
 26  1 is available for sales and use tax paid prior to project
 26  2 completion, which is currently defined to mean the first date
 26  3 upon which the average annualized production of finished
 26  4 product for the preceding 90=day period at the manufacturing
 26  5 facility operated by the eligible business is at least 50
 26  6 percent of the initial design capacity of the facility.  The
 26  7 division amends the definition of "project completion" to mean
 26  8 the date on which the EDA notifies the department of revenue
 26  9 that all applicable requirements of a workforce housing tax
 26 10 incentive program agreement are satisfied.  This provision
 26 11 takes effect upon enactment and applies retroactively to July
 26 12 1, 2014, for all workforce housing tax incentive agreements
 26 13 entered into on or after that date.
 26 14    The division allows the EDA to extend the project
 26 15 completion date for a project awarded tax incentives under the
 26 16 redevelopment tax credit program and the housing enterprise
 26 17 zone tax incentives program if the property that is the subject
 26 18 of the project suffered a catastrophic fire during the 2014
 26 19 calendar year.
       LSB 1212HV (3) 86
       mm/sc
 19 18 successful completion of all requirements of the program.  The
 19 19 EDA is authorized to impose two compliance cost fees under the
 19 20 program.  The first fee equals $500 per agreement.  The second
 19 21 fee equals 0.5 percent of the value of the tax credit claimed
 19 22 pursuant to the agreement if the agreement has an aggregate tax
 19 23 credit value of $100,000 or greater.
 19 24    An eligible business that fails to comply with the
 19 25 requirements of the program or the terms of an agreement with
 19 26 the EDA may have its tax credits reduced, terminated, or
 19 27 rescinded, and may be subject to the repayment or recapture of
 19 28 claimed tax credits.
 19 29    Upon determining that all requirements of an agreement and
 19 30 the program have been fulfilled, the EDA shall issue a tax
 19 31 credit and related tax credit certificate to the eligible
 19 32 business in an amount equal to the product of $.05 multiplied
 19 33 by the number of pounds of renewable chemicals produced in Iowa
 19 34 from biomass feedstock by the eligible business during the
 19 35 calendar year.  Renewable chemicals produced by an eligible
 20  1 business prior to the effective date of the division, or
 20  2 prior to the date the business first qualifies as an eligible
 20  3 business, or after calendar year 2025, shall not qualify for
 20  4 the tax credit.
 20  5    The tax credit shall be claimed for the tax year during
 20  6 which the eligible business was issued the tax credit.  The tax
 20  7 credit may be claimed against the individual income tax and the
 20  8 corporate income tax.  The credit is refundable or may, at the
 20  9 election of the taxpayer, be carried forward for up to one tax
 20 10 year.   The tax credit shall not be transferred to any person.  A
 20 11 tax credit issued to a partnership, limited liability company,
 20 12 S corporation, cooperative organized under Code chapter 501
 20 13 and filing as a partnership for federal tax purposes, estate,
 20 14 or trust electing to have the income taxed directly to the
 20 15 individual may be claimed by the individual based upon the pro
 20 16 rata share of the individual's earnings from that entity.
 20 17    The division provides that the program is subject to the
 20 18 EDA's maximum aggregate tax credit cap of $170 million per
 20 19 fiscal year in Code section 15.119, and not more than $15
 20 20 million per fiscal year may be issued by the EDA under the
 20 21 program.  In addition, the maximum amount of tax credit that
 20 22 may be issued to an eligible business in any one calendar year
 20 23 shall not exceed $1 million or $500,000, depending on whether
 20 24 the eligible business has been operating in Iowa at the time of
 20 25 application for five or fewer years, or more than five years,
 20 26 respectively.  An eligible business shall not receive more than
 20 27 five tax credits under the program.  The EDA is required to
 20 28 issue tax credits on a first=come, first=served basis until the
 20 29 maximum amount of $15 million per fiscal year is reached.  If
 20 30 the amount of tax credits exceeds this amount in a fiscal year,
 20 31 the EDA is required to establish a wait list and give priority
 20 32 in subsequent years to the eligible businesses on the wait
 20 33 list.
 20 34    The division provides for the confidentiality of certain
 20 35 information under the program.  The identity of a tax credit
 21  1 recipient and the amount of the tax credit shall be considered
 21  2 public information under Code chapter 22 (examination of public
 21  3 records), but any other information or record in the possession
 21  4 of the EDA with respect to the program shall be presumed by
 21  5 the EDA to be a trade secret protected under Code chapter 550
 21  6 or common law and shall be kept confidential by the EDA unless
 21  7 otherwise ordered by a court.
 21  8    The division takes effect upon enactment and applies to
 21  9 renewable chemicals produced in Iowa from biomass feedstock on
 21 10 or after that date.  The division applies retroactively to tax
 21 11 years beginning on or after January 1, 2015.
 21 12    DIVISION II ==== ANGEL INVESTOR TAX CREDITS.   Division II
 21 13 makes several changes to the tax credit for investments in
 21 14 qualifying businesses and community=based seed capital funds,
 21 15 often referred to as the angel investor tax credits.  The
 21 16 division amends the purpose of the tax credit in Code section
 21 17 15E.41.  The division excludes investments in community=based
 21 18 seed capital funds from qualifying for the tax credit and
 21 19 makes several conforming amendments to remove references to
 21 20 community=based seed capital funds from the Code.
 21 21    The division modifies the amount and dollar limitation of
 21 22 the tax credit for a taxpayer.  The tax credit is increased
 21 23 from 20 percent to 25 percent of a taxpayer's equity investment
 21 24 in a qualifying business.  Under current law, a taxpayer cannot
 21 25 claim more than $50,000 of tax credit per investment in a
 21 26 qualifying business, and for each tax year a taxpayer and the
 21 27 taxpayer's affiliates cannot claim tax credits for more than
 21 28 five investments in five different qualifying businesses.  The
 21 29 division amends this dollar limitation to prohibit a natural
 21 30 person and the person's spouse, child, or sibling from claiming
 21 31 a combined amount of more than $100,000 in tax credits per tax
 21 32 year.
 21 33    The division also provides that no more than $500,000 in tax
 21 34 credits may be issued per tax year for equity investments in
 21 35 any one qualifying business.
 22  1 The division modifies the procedures for claiming the tax
 22  2 credit.  Under current law, the tax credit is not refundable
 22  3 but available for carryforward for up to five tax years.  The
 22  4 division makes the tax credit refundable for an investment
 22  5 made by a natural person, and for any other person reduces the
 22  6 carryforward period to three years.
 22  7    The division strikes a provision permitting the EDA
 22  8 to cooperate with small business development centers to
 22  9 disseminate information regarding the credits and to develop
 22 10 standard application forms, and requiring the EDA to distribute
 22 11 copies of the application forms to all community=based seed
 22 12 capital funds and potential individual investors.
 22 13    The division modifies the eligibility requirements for
 22 14 qualifying businesses.  The division strikes the requirement
 22 15 that a business have an owner that meets at least one of
 22 16 four qualifications relating to business education or
 22 17 business experience.  The division requires that a business
 22 18 be participating in an entrepreneurial assistance program,
 22 19 as defined in the division, but allows the EDA to waive this
 22 20 requirement if the business establishes that its owners,
 22 21 directors, officers, and employees have an appropriate level
 22 22 of experience such that an entrepreneurial assistance program
 22 23 would not materially change the prospects of the business.
 22 24 The EDA is allowed to consult with outside service providers
 22 25 in considering such a waiver.  The division increases from $5
 22 26 million to $10 million the maximum amount of net worth that
 22 27 a business may have to be considered a qualifying business.
 22 28 The division increases from $250,000 to $500,000 the amount of
 22 29 financing that a business must have in order to be considered a
 22 30 qualifying business, removes "near equity" from the types of
 22 31 financing that will be considered in that calculation, requires
 22 32 that the financing be secured at the time of application for
 22 33 the tax credits, and requires that the business have at least
 22 34 two investors at the time of application for the tax credits.
 22 35 These modified eligibility requirements apply to businesses
 23  1 that submit an application to the EDA to be registered as a
 23  2 qualifying business on or after the effective date of this
 23  3 division of the bill, and businesses that submitted such an
 23  4 application to the EDA before the effective date of this
 23  5 division of the bill shall be governed by current law.
 23  6    The division provides for the confidentiality of certain
 23  7 information with regard to the tax credit.  The identity of
 23  8 a qualifying business, the identity of an investor and the
 23  9 qualifying business in which the investor made an equity
 23 10 investment, and the total number and amount of tax credits
 23 11 issued shall be considered public information under Code
 23 12 chapter 22 (examination of public records), but any other
 23 13 information or record in the possession of the EDA with respect
 23 14 to the program shall be presumed by the EDA to be a trade secret
 23 15 protected under Code chapter 550 or common law and shall be
 23 16 kept confidential by the EDA unless otherwise ordered by a
 23 17 court.
 23 18    The division takes effect upon enactment and applies to
 23 19 equity investments in a qualifying business made on or after
 23 20 that date.  Equity investments in a qualifying business or
 23 21 community=based seed capital fund made prior to the effective
 23 22 date of the division shall be governed by current law.
 23 23    DIVISION III ==== ENTREPRENEUR INVESTMENT AWARDS PROGRAM.
 23 24  Division III amends the entrepreneur investment awards program
 23 25 administered by the EDA.  The division strikes provisions that
 23 26 prohibited the EDA from making awards under the program since
 23 27 July 1, 2014, and that required the EDA by December 31, 2014,
 23 28 to conduct a comprehensive review of the program and submit
 23 29 a report with specified information to the governor and the
 23 30 general assembly.
 23 31    The division modifies the purpose of the program to be
 23 32 to provide financial assistance to eligible entrepreneurial
 23 33 assistance providers (provider) that provide technical and
 23 34 financial assistance to entrepreneurs and start=up companies
 23 35 seeking to create, locate, or expand a business in Iowa.
 24  1 "Financial assistance" is defined in the division.
 24  2    The division changes the requirements for receiving an
 24  3 award.  To be eligible to receive an award under current
 24  4 law, an entrepreneurial assistance program must have been
 24  5 an Iowa=based business, expended at least $500,000 during
 24  6 the previous fiscal year to provide technical and financial
 24  7 assistance services that meet the broad=based needs of
 24  8 entrepreneurs seeking to create, locate, or expand a business
 24  9 in Iowa that intends to derive more than 10 percent of its
 24 10 gross sales from markets outside Iowa; and must have engaged
 24 11 and communicated with certain other programs, funding sources,
 24 12 and entities for its entrepreneur clients.  The division
 24 13 amends the eligibility for receiving financial assistance to
 24 14 require that a provider have its principal place of operations
 24 15 in Iowa and that the provider offer a comprehensive set of
 24 16 business development services to emerging and early=stage
 24 17 innovation companies to assist in the creation, location,
 24 18 growth, and long=term success of the company in Iowa.
 24 19 "Business development services" is defined in the division.
 24 20 Business development services may be performed at the physical
 24 21 location of the provider or the company and may be provided in
 24 22 consideration of equity participation in the company, a fee for
 24 23 services, or a membership agreement with the company.
 24 24    Under current law, the EDA board could approve, deny, or
 24 25 defer each application for a grant, and was required to award
 24 26 grants on a first=come, first=served basis.  The division
 24 27 specifies that the EDA board has the discretion to approve,
 24 28 deny, or defer each application for financial assistance and
 24 29 that the amount of financial assistance awarded to a provider
 24 30 is within the discretion of the EDA.  The division requires
 24 31 the EDA to award financial assistance on a competitive basis
 24 32 and allows the EDA to develop scoring criteria and establish
 24 33 minimum requirements for the receipt of a financial assistance
 24 34 award.
 24 35    In addition to the four factors relating to the provider's
 25  1 professional staff that the EDA may consider under current
 25  2 law in deciding whether to award financial assistance, the
 25  3 division provides that the EDA may also consider the service
 25  4 model and likelihood of success of the provider, the provider's
 25  5 similarity to other successful providers in the country, and
 25  6 the provider's financial need.
 25  7    The division modifies the maximum award amount for a
 25  8 recipient.  Under current law, a grant to an entrepreneur
 25  9 assistance program cannot exceed the lesser of 25 percent of
 25 10 the funds expended by the program during the previous fiscal
 25 11 year, 100 percent of the funds raised from certain persons
 25 12 by the program during the previous fiscal year, or $200,000.
 25 13 The division provides that the amount of financial assistance
 25 14 awarded to any one provider shall not exceed $200,000.
 25 15    The division modifies the permitted use of funds received
 25 16 under the program.  Under current law, grants are only
 25 17 permitted to be used for the purpose of operating costs
 25 18 incurred by the program.  The division specifies that financial
 25 19 assistance awarded to a provider shall only be used for
 25 20 the purpose of operating costs incurred by the provider in
 25 21 the provision of business development services to emerging
 25 22 and early=stage innovation companies in Iowa.  The division
 25 23 further requires that such financial assistance shall not be
 25 24 distributed to owners or investors of the company to which the
 25 25 business development services are being provided and shall not
 25 26 be provided to other persons assisting with the provision of
 25 27 the services.
 25 28    Under current law, an entrepreneurial assistance provider is
 25 29 required to accept client referrals from the EDA as a condition
 25 30 of receiving a grant.  The division provides that the EDA may
 25 31 make client referrals to eligible providers.
 25 32    DIVISION IV ==== MISCELLANEOUS CHANGES.  Division IV makes
 25 33 several miscellaneous changes to other EDA programs.  The
 25 34 division amends the sales and use tax refund available under
 25 35 the workforce housing tax incentive program.  That refund
 26  1 is available for sales and use tax paid prior to project
 26  2 completion, which is currently defined to mean the first date
 26  3 upon which the average annualized production of finished
 26  4 product for the preceding 90=day period at the manufacturing
 26  5 facility operated by the eligible business is at least 50
 26  6 percent of the initial design capacity of the facility.  The
 26  7 division amends the definition of "project completion" to mean
 26  8 the date on which the EDA notifies the department of revenue
 26  9 that all applicable requirements of a workforce housing tax
 26 10 incentive program agreement are satisfied.  This provision
 26 11 takes effect upon enactment and applies retroactively to July
 26 12 1, 2014, for all workforce housing tax incentive agreements
 26 13 entered into on or after that date.
 26 14    The division allows the EDA to extend the project
 26 15 completion date for a project awarded tax incentives under the
 26 16 redevelopment tax credit program and the housing enterprise
 26 17 zone tax incentives program if the property that is the subject
 26 18 of the project suffered a catastrophic fire during the 2014
 26 19 calendar year.
       LSB 1212HV (3) 86
       mm/sc
 19 19 EDA is authorized to impose two compliance cost fees under the
 19 20 program.  The first fee equals $500 per agreement.  The second
 19 21 fee equals 0.5 percent of the value of the tax credit claimed
 19 22 pursuant to the agreement if the agreement has an aggregate tax
 19 23 credit value of $100,000 or greater.
 19 24    An eligible business that fails to comply with the
 19 25 requirements of the program or the terms of an agreement with
 19 26 the EDA may have its tax credits reduced, terminated, or
 19 27 rescinded, and may be subject to the repayment or recapture of
 19 28 claimed tax credits.
 19 29    Upon determining that all requirements of an agreement and
 19 30 the program have been fulfilled, the EDA shall issue a tax
 19 31 credit and related tax credit certificate to the eligible
 19 32 business in an amount equal to the product of $.05 multiplied
 19 33 by the number of pounds of renewable chemicals produced in Iowa
 19 34 from biomass feedstock by the eligible business during the
 19 35 calendar year.  Renewable chemicals produced by an eligible
 20  1 business prior to the effective date of the division, or
 20  2 prior to the date the business first qualifies as an eligible
 20  3 business, or after calendar year 2025, shall not qualify for
 20  4 the tax credit.
 20  5    The tax credit shall be claimed for the tax year during
 20  6 which the eligible business was issued the tax credit.  The tax
 20  7 credit may be claimed against the individual income tax and the
 20  8 corporate income tax.  The credit is refundable or may, at the
 20  9 election of the taxpayer, be carried forward for up to one tax
 20 10 year.   The tax credit shall not be transferred to any person.  A
 20 11 tax credit issued to a partnership, limited liability company,
 20 12 S corporation, cooperative organized under Code chapter 501
 20 13 and filing as a partnership for federal tax purposes, estate,
 20 14 or trust electing to have the income taxed directly to the
 20 15 individual may be claimed by the individual based upon the pro
 20 16 rata share of the individual's earnings from that entity.
 20 17    The division provides that the program is subject to the
 20 18 EDA's maximum aggregate tax credit cap of $170 million per
 20 19 fiscal year in Code section 15.119, and not more than $15
 20 20 million per fiscal year may be issued by the EDA under the
 20 21 program.  In addition, the maximum amount of tax credit that
 20 22 may be issued to an eligible business in any one calendar year
 20 23 shall not exceed $1 million or $500,000, depending on whether
 20 24 the eligible business has been operating in Iowa at the time of
 20 25 application for five or fewer years, or more than five years,
 20 26 respectively.  An eligible business shall not receive more than
 20 27 five tax credits under the program.  The EDA is required to
 20 28 issue tax credits on a first=come, first=served basis until the
 20 29 maximum amount of $15 million per fiscal year is reached.  If
 20 30 the amount of tax credits exceeds this amount in a fiscal year,
 20 31 the EDA is required to establish a wait list and give priority
 20 32 in subsequent years to the eligible businesses on the wait
 20 33 list.
 20 34    The division provides for the confidentiality of certain
 20 35 information under the program.  The identity of a tax credit
 21  1 recipient and the amount of the tax credit shall be considered
 21  2 public information under Code chapter 22 (examination of public
 21  3 records), but any other information or record in the possession
 21  4 of the EDA with respect to the program shall be presumed by
 21  5 the EDA to be a trade secret protected under Code chapter 550
 21  6 or common law and shall be kept confidential by the EDA unless
 21  7 otherwise ordered by a court.
 21  8    The division takes effect upon enactment and applies to
 21  9 renewable chemicals produced in Iowa from biomass feedstock on
 21 10 or after that date.  The division applies retroactively to tax
 21 11 years beginning on or after January 1, 2015.
 21 12    DIVISION II ==== ANGEL INVESTOR TAX CREDITS.   Division II
 21 13 makes several changes to the tax credit for investments in
 21 14 qualifying businesses and community=based seed capital funds,
 21 15 often referred to as the angel investor tax credits.  The
 21 16 division amends the purpose of the tax credit in Code section
 21 17 15E.41.  The division excludes investments in community=based
 21 18 seed capital funds from qualifying for the tax credit and
 21 19 makes several conforming amendments to remove references to
 21 20 community=based seed capital funds from the Code.
 21 21    The division modifies the amount and dollar limitation of
 21 22 the tax credit for a taxpayer.  The tax credit is increased
 21 23 from 20 percent to 25 percent of a taxpayer's equity investment
 21 24 in a qualifying business.  Under current law, a taxpayer cannot
 21 25 claim more than $50,000 of tax credit per investment in a
 21 26 qualifying business, and for each tax year a taxpayer and the
 21 27 taxpayer's affiliates cannot claim tax credits for more than
 21 28 five investments in five different qualifying businesses.  The
 21 29 division amends this dollar limitation to prohibit a natural
 21 30 person and the person's spouse, child, or sibling from claiming
 21 31 a combined amount of more than $100,000 in tax credits per tax
 21 32 year.
 21 33    The division also provides that no more than $500,000 in tax
 21 34 credits may be issued per tax year for equity investments in
 21 35 any one qualifying business.
 22  1 The division modifies the procedures for claiming the tax
 22  2 credit.  Under current law, the tax credit is not refundable
 22  3 but available for carryforward for up to five tax years.  The
 22  4 division makes the tax credit refundable for an investment
 22  5 made by a natural person, and for any other person reduces the
 22  6 carryforward period to three years.
 22  7    The division strikes a provision permitting the EDA
 22  8 to cooperate with small business development centers to
 22  9 disseminate information regarding the credits and to develop
 22 10 standard application forms, and requiring the EDA to distribute
 22 11 copies of the application forms to all community=based seed
 22 12 capital funds and potential individual investors.
 22 13    The division modifies the eligibility requirements for
 22 14 qualifying businesses.  The division strikes the requirement
 22 15 that a business have an owner that meets at least one of
 22 16 four qualifications relating to business education or
 22 17 business experience.  The division requires that a business
 22 18 be participating in an entrepreneurial assistance program,
 22 19 as defined in the division, but allows the EDA to waive this
 22 20 requirement if the business establishes that its owners,
 22 21 directors, officers, and employees have an appropriate level
 22 22 of experience such that an entrepreneurial assistance program
 22 23 would not materially change the prospects of the business.
 22 24 The EDA is allowed to consult with outside service providers
 22 25 in considering such a waiver.  The division increases from $5
 22 26 million to $10 million the maximum amount of net worth that
 22 27 a business may have to be considered a qualifying business.
 22 28 The division increases from $250,000 to $500,000 the amount of
 22 29 financing that a business must have in order to be considered a
 22 30 qualifying business, removes "near equity" from the types of
 22 31 financing that will be considered in that calculation, requires
 22 32 that the financing be secured at the time of application for
 22 33 the tax credits, and requires that the business have at least
 22 34 two investors at the time of application for the tax credits.
 22 35 These modified eligibility requirements apply to businesses
 23  1 that submit an application to the EDA to be registered as a
 23  2 qualifying business on or after the effective date of this
 23  3 division of the bill, and businesses that submitted such an
 23  4 application to the EDA before the effective date of this
 23  5 division of the bill shall be governed by current law.
 23  6    The division provides for the confidentiality of certain
 23  7 information with regard to the tax credit.  The identity of
 23  8 a qualifying business, the identity of an investor and the
 23  9 qualifying business in which the investor made an equity
 23 10 investment, and the total number and amount of tax credits
 23 11 issued shall be considered public information under Code
 23 12 chapter 22 (examination of public records), but any other
 23 13 information or record in the possession of the EDA with respect
 23 14 to the program shall be presumed by the EDA to be a trade secret
 23 15 protected under Code chapter 550 or common law and shall be
 23 16 kept confidential by the EDA unless otherwise ordered by a
 23 17 court.
 23 18    The division takes effect upon enactment and applies to
 23 19 equity investments in a qualifying business made on or after
 23 20 that date.  Equity investments in a qualifying business or
 23 21 community=based seed capital fund made prior to the effective
 23 22 date of the division shall be governed by current law.
 23 23    DIVISION III ==== ENTREPRENEUR INVESTMENT AWARDS PROGRAM.
 23 24  Division III amends the entrepreneur investment awards program
 23 25 administered by the EDA.  The division strikes provisions that
 23 26 prohibited the EDA from making awards under the program since
 23 27 July 1, 2014, and that required the EDA by December 31, 2014,
 23 28 to conduct a comprehensive review of the program and submit
 23 29 a report with specified information to the governor and the
 23 30 general assembly.
 23 31    The division modifies the purpose of the program to be
 23 32 to provide financial assistance to eligible entrepreneurial
 23 33 assistance providers (provider) that provide technical and
 23 34 financial assistance to entrepreneurs and start=up companies
 23 35 seeking to create, locate, or expand a business in Iowa.
 24  1 "Financial assistance" is defined in the division.
 24  2    The division changes the requirements for receiving an
 24  3 award.  To be eligible to receive an award under current
 24  4 law, an entrepreneurial assistance program must have been
 24  5 an Iowa=based business, expended at least $500,000 during
 24  6 the previous fiscal year to provide technical and financial
 24  7 assistance services that meet the broad=based needs of
 24  8 entrepreneurs seeking to create, locate, or expand a business
 24  9 in Iowa that intends to derive more than 10 percent of its
 24 10 gross sales from markets outside Iowa; and must have engaged
 24 11 and communicated with certain other programs, funding sources,
 24 12 and entities for its entrepreneur clients.  The division
 24 13 amends the eligibility for receiving financial assistance to
 24 14 require that a provider have its principal place of operations
 24 15 in Iowa and that the provider offer a comprehensive set of
 24 16 business development services to emerging and early=stage
 24 17 innovation companies to assist in the creation, location,
 24 18 growth, and long=term success of the company in Iowa.
 24 19 "Business development services" is defined in the division.
 24 20 Business development services may be performed at the physical
 24 21 location of the provider or the company and may be provided in
 24 22 consideration of equity participation in the company, a fee for
 24 23 services, or a membership agreement with the company.
 24 24    Under current law, the EDA board could approve, deny, or
 24 25 defer each application for a grant, and was required to award
 24 26 grants on a first=come, first=served basis.  The division
 24 27 specifies that the EDA board has the discretion to approve,
 24 28 deny, or defer each application for financial assistance and
 24 29 that the amount of financial assistance awarded to a provider
 24 30 is within the discretion of the EDA.  The division requires
 24 31 the EDA to award financial assistance on a competitive basis
 24 32 and allows the EDA to develop scoring criteria and establish
 24 33 minimum requirements for the receipt of a financial assistance
 24 34 award.
 24 35    In addition to the four factors relating to the provider's
 25  1 professional staff that the EDA may consider under current
 25  2 law in deciding whether to award financial assistance, the
 25  3 division provides that the EDA may also consider the service
 25  4 model and likelihood of success of the provider, the provider's
 25  5 similarity to other successful providers in the country, and
 25  6 the provider's financial need.
 25  7    The division modifies the maximum award amount for a
 25  8 recipient.  Under current law, a grant to an entrepreneur
 25  9 assistance program cannot exceed the lesser of 25 percent of
 25 10 the funds expended by the program during the previous fiscal
 25 11 year, 100 percent of the funds raised from certain persons
 25 12 by the program during the previous fiscal year, or $200,000.
 25 13 The division provides that the amount of financial assistance
 25 14 awarded to any one provider shall not exceed $200,000.
 25 15    The division modifies the permitted use of funds received
 25 16 under the program.  Under current law, grants are only
 25 17 permitted to be used for the purpose of operating costs
 25 18 incurred by the program.  The division specifies that financial
 25 19 assistance awarded to a provider shall only be used for
 25 20 the purpose of operating costs incurred by the provider in
 25 21 the provision of business development services to emerging
 25 22 and early=stage innovation companies in Iowa.  The division
 25 23 further requires that such financial assistance shall not be
 25 24 distributed to owners or investors of the company to which the
 25 25 business development services are being provided and shall not
 25 26 be provided to other persons assisting with the provision of
 25 27 the services.
 25 28    Under current law, an entrepreneurial assistance provider is
 25 29 required to accept client referrals from the EDA as a condition
 25 30 of receiving a grant.  The division provides that the EDA may
 25 31 make client referrals to eligible providers.
 25 32    DIVISION IV ==== MISCELLANEOUS CHANGES.  Division IV makes
 25 33 several miscellaneous changes to other EDA programs.  The
 25 34 division amends the sales and use tax refund available under
 25 35 the workforce housing tax incentive program.  That refund
 26  1 is available for sales and use tax paid prior to project
 26  2 completion, which is currently defined to mean the first date
 26  3 upon which the average annualized production of finished
 26  4 product for the preceding 90=day period at the manufacturing
 26  5 facility operated by the eligible business is at least 50
 26  6 percent of the initial design capacity of the facility.  The
 26  7 division amends the definition of "project completion" to mean
 26  8 the date on which the EDA notifies the department of revenue
 26  9 that all applicable requirements of a workforce housing tax
 26 10 incentive program agreement are satisfied.  This provision
 26 11 takes effect upon enactment and applies retroactively to July
 26 12 1, 2014, for all workforce housing tax incentive agreements
 26 13 entered into on or after that date.
 26 14    The division allows the EDA to extend the project
 26 15 completion date for a project awarded tax incentives under the
 26 16 redevelopment tax credit program and the housing enterprise
 26 17 zone tax incentives program if the property that is the subject
 26 18 of the project suffered a catastrophic fire during the 2014
 26 19 calendar year.
       LSB 1212HV (3) 86
       mm/sc
 19 20 program.  The first fee equals $500 per agreement.  The second
 19 21 fee equals 0.5 percent of the value of the tax credit claimed
 19 22 pursuant to the agreement if the agreement has an aggregate tax
 19 23 credit value of $100,000 or greater.
 19 24    An eligible business that fails to comply with the
 19 25 requirements of the program or the terms of an agreement with
 19 26 the EDA may have its tax credits reduced, terminated, or
 19 27 rescinded, and may be subject to the repayment or recapture of
 19 28 claimed tax credits.
 19 29    Upon determining that all requirements of an agreement and
 19 30 the program have been fulfilled, the EDA shall issue a tax
 19 31 credit and related tax credit certificate to the eligible
 19 32 business in an amount equal to the product of $.05 multiplied
 19 33 by the number of pounds of renewable chemicals produced in Iowa
 19 34 from biomass feedstock by the eligible business during the
 19 35 calendar year.  Renewable chemicals produced by an eligible
 20  1 business prior to the effective date of the division, or
 20  2 prior to the date the business first qualifies as an eligible
 20  3 business, or after calendar year 2025, shall not qualify for
 20  4 the tax credit.
 20  5    The tax credit shall be claimed for the tax year during
 20  6 which the eligible business was issued the tax credit.  The tax
 20  7 credit may be claimed against the individual income tax and the
 20  8 corporate income tax.  The credit is refundable or may, at the
 20  9 election of the taxpayer, be carried forward for up to one tax
 20 10 year.   The tax credit shall not be transferred to any person.  A
 20 11 tax credit issued to a partnership, limited liability company,
 20 12 S corporation, cooperative organized under Code chapter 501
 20 13 and filing as a partnership for federal tax purposes, estate,
 20 14 or trust electing to have the income taxed directly to the
 20 15 individual may be claimed by the individual based upon the pro
 20 16 rata share of the individual's earnings from that entity.
 20 17    The division provides that the program is subject to the
 20 18 EDA's maximum aggregate tax credit cap of $170 million per
 20 19 fiscal year in Code section 15.119, and not more than $15
 20 20 million per fiscal year may be issued by the EDA under the
 20 21 program.  In addition, the maximum amount of tax credit that
 20 22 may be issued to an eligible business in any one calendar year
 20 23 shall not exceed $1 million or $500,000, depending on whether
 20 24 the eligible business has been operating in Iowa at the time of
 20 25 application for five or fewer years, or more than five years,
 20 26 respectively.  An eligible business shall not receive more than
 20 27 five tax credits under the program.  The EDA is required to
 20 28 issue tax credits on a first=come, first=served basis until the
 20 29 maximum amount of $15 million per fiscal year is reached.  If
 20 30 the amount of tax credits exceeds this amount in a fiscal year,
 20 31 the EDA is required to establish a wait list and give priority
 20 32 in subsequent years to the eligible businesses on the wait
 20 33 list.
 20 34    The division provides for the confidentiality of certain
 20 35 information under the program.  The identity of a tax credit
 21  1 recipient and the amount of the tax credit shall be considered
 21  2 public information under Code chapter 22 (examination of public
 21  3 records), but any other information or record in the possession
 21  4 of the EDA with respect to the program shall be presumed by
 21  5 the EDA to be a trade secret protected under Code chapter 550
 21  6 or common law and shall be kept confidential by the EDA unless
 21  7 otherwise ordered by a court.
 21  8    The division takes effect upon enactment and applies to
 21  9 renewable chemicals produced in Iowa from biomass feedstock on
 21 10 or after that date.  The division applies retroactively to tax
 21 11 years beginning on or after January 1, 2015.
 21 12    DIVISION II ==== ANGEL INVESTOR TAX CREDITS.   Division II
 21 13 makes several changes to the tax credit for investments in
 21 14 qualifying businesses and community=based seed capital funds,
 21 15 often referred to as the angel investor tax credits.  The
 21 16 division amends the purpose of the tax credit in Code section
 21 17 15E.41.  The division excludes investments in community=based
 21 18 seed capital funds from qualifying for the tax credit and
 21 19 makes several conforming amendments to remove references to
 21 20 community=based seed capital funds from the Code.
 21 21    The division modifies the amount and dollar limitation of
 21 22 the tax credit for a taxpayer.  The tax credit is increased
 21 23 from 20 percent to 25 percent of a taxpayer's equity investment
 21 24 in a qualifying business.  Under current law, a taxpayer cannot
 21 25 claim more than $50,000 of tax credit per investment in a
 21 26 qualifying business, and for each tax year a taxpayer and the
 21 27 taxpayer's affiliates cannot claim tax credits for more than
 21 28 five investments in five different qualifying businesses.  The
 21 29 division amends this dollar limitation to prohibit a natural
 21 30 person and the person's spouse, child, or sibling from claiming
 21 31 a combined amount of more than $100,000 in tax credits per tax
 21 32 year.
 21 33    The division also provides that no more than $500,000 in tax
 21 34 credits may be issued per tax year for equity investments in
 21 35 any one qualifying business.
 22  1 The division modifies the procedures for claiming the tax
 22  2 credit.  Under current law, the tax credit is not refundable
 22  3 but available for carryforward for up to five tax years.  The
 22  4 division makes the tax credit refundable for an investment
 22  5 made by a natural person, and for any other person reduces the
 22  6 carryforward period to three years.
 22  7    The division strikes a provision permitting the EDA
 22  8 to cooperate with small business development centers to
 22  9 disseminate information regarding the credits and to develop
 22 10 standard application forms, and requiring the EDA to distribute
 22 11 copies of the application forms to all community=based seed
 22 12 capital funds and potential individual investors.
 22 13    The division modifies the eligibility requirements for
 22 14 qualifying businesses.  The division strikes the requirement
 22 15 that a business have an owner that meets at least one of
 22 16 four qualifications relating to business education or
 22 17 business experience.  The division requires that a business
 22 18 be participating in an entrepreneurial assistance program,
 22 19 as defined in the division, but allows the EDA to waive this
 22 20 requirement if the business establishes that its owners,
 22 21 directors, officers, and employees have an appropriate level
 22 22 of experience such that an entrepreneurial assistance program
 22 23 would not materially change the prospects of the business.
 22 24 The EDA is allowed to consult with outside service providers
 22 25 in considering such a waiver.  The division increases from $5
 22 26 million to $10 million the maximum amount of net worth that
 22 27 a business may have to be considered a qualifying business.
 22 28 The division increases from $250,000 to $500,000 the amount of
 22 29 financing that a business must have in order to be considered a
 22 30 qualifying business, removes "near equity" from the types of
 22 31 financing that will be considered in that calculation, requires
 22 32 that the financing be secured at the time of application for
 22 33 the tax credits, and requires that the business have at least
 22 34 two investors at the time of application for the tax credits.
 22 35 These modified eligibility requirements apply to businesses
 23  1 that submit an application to the EDA to be registered as a
 23  2 qualifying business on or after the effective date of this
 23  3 division of the bill, and businesses that submitted such an
 23  4 application to the EDA before the effective date of this
 23  5 division of the bill shall be governed by current law.
 23  6    The division provides for the confidentiality of certain
 23  7 information with regard to the tax credit.  The identity of
 23  8 a qualifying business, the identity of an investor and the
 23  9 qualifying business in which the investor made an equity
 23 10 investment, and the total number and amount of tax credits
 23 11 issued shall be considered public information under Code
 23 12 chapter 22 (examination of public records), but any other
 23 13 information or record in the possession of the EDA with respect
 23 14 to the program shall be presumed by the EDA to be a trade secret
 23 15 protected under Code chapter 550 or common law and shall be
 23 16 kept confidential by the EDA unless otherwise ordered by a
 23 17 court.
 23 18    The division takes effect upon enactment and applies to
 23 19 equity investments in a qualifying business made on or after
 23 20 that date.  Equity investments in a qualifying business or
 23 21 community=based seed capital fund made prior to the effective
 23 22 date of the division shall be governed by current law.
 23 23    DIVISION III ==== ENTREPRENEUR INVESTMENT AWARDS PROGRAM.
 23 24  Division III amends the entrepreneur investment awards program
 23 25 administered by the EDA.  The division strikes provisions that
 23 26 prohibited the EDA from making awards under the program since
 23 27 July 1, 2014, and that required the EDA by December 31, 2014,
 23 28 to conduct a comprehensive review of the program and submit
 23 29 a report with specified information to the governor and the
 23 30 general assembly.
 23 31    The division modifies the purpose of the program to be
 23 32 to provide financial assistance to eligible entrepreneurial
 23 33 assistance providers (provider) that provide technical and
 23 34 financial assistance to entrepreneurs and start=up companies
 23 35 seeking to create, locate, or expand a business in Iowa.
 24  1 "Financial assistance" is defined in the division.
 24  2    The division changes the requirements for receiving an
 24  3 award.  To be eligible to receive an award under current
 24  4 law, an entrepreneurial assistance program must have been
 24  5 an Iowa=based business, expended at least $500,000 during
 24  6 the previous fiscal year to provide technical and financial
 24  7 assistance services that meet the broad=based needs of
 24  8 entrepreneurs seeking to create, locate, or expand a business
 24  9 in Iowa that intends to derive more than 10 percent of its
 24 10 gross sales from markets outside Iowa; and must have engaged
 24 11 and communicated with certain other programs, funding sources,
 24 12 and entities for its entrepreneur clients.  The division
 24 13 amends the eligibility for receiving financial assistance to
 24 14 require that a provider have its principal place of operations
 24 15 in Iowa and that the provider offer a comprehensive set of
 24 16 business development services to emerging and early=stage
 24 17 innovation companies to assist in the creation, location,
 24 18 growth, and long=term success of the company in Iowa.
 24 19 "Business development services" is defined in the division.
 24 20 Business development services may be performed at the physical
 24 21 location of the provider or the company and may be provided in
 24 22 consideration of equity participation in the company, a fee for
 24 23 services, or a membership agreement with the company.
 24 24    Under current law, the EDA board could approve, deny, or
 24 25 defer each application for a grant, and was required to award
 24 26 grants on a first=come, first=served basis.  The division
 24 27 specifies that the EDA board has the discretion to approve,
 24 28 deny, or defer each application for financial assistance and
 24 29 that the amount of financial assistance awarded to a provider
 24 30 is within the discretion of the EDA.  The division requires
 24 31 the EDA to award financial assistance on a competitive basis
 24 32 and allows the EDA to develop scoring criteria and establish
 24 33 minimum requirements for the receipt of a financial assistance
 24 34 award.
 24 35    In addition to the four factors relating to the provider's
 25  1 professional staff that the EDA may consider under current
 25  2 law in deciding whether to award financial assistance, the
 25  3 division provides that the EDA may also consider the service
 25  4 model and likelihood of success of the provider, the provider's
 25  5 similarity to other successful providers in the country, and
 25  6 the provider's financial need.
 25  7    The division modifies the maximum award amount for a
 25  8 recipient.  Under current law, a grant to an entrepreneur
 25  9 assistance program cannot exceed the lesser of 25 percent of
 25 10 the funds expended by the program during the previous fiscal
 25 11 year, 100 percent of the funds raised from certain persons
 25 12 by the program during the previous fiscal year, or $200,000.
 25 13 The division provides that the amount of financial assistance
 25 14 awarded to any one provider shall not exceed $200,000.
 25 15    The division modifies the permitted use of funds received
 25 16 under the program.  Under current law, grants are only
 25 17 permitted to be used for the purpose of operating costs
 25 18 incurred by the program.  The division specifies that financial
 25 19 assistance awarded to a provider shall only be used for
 25 20 the purpose of operating costs incurred by the provider in
 25 21 the provision of business development services to emerging
 25 22 and early=stage innovation companies in Iowa.  The division
 25 23 further requires that such financial assistance shall not be
 25 24 distributed to owners or investors of the company to which the
 25 25 business development services are being provided and shall not
 25 26 be provided to other persons assisting with the provision of
 25 27 the services.
 25 28    Under current law, an entrepreneurial assistance provider is
 25 29 required to accept client referrals from the EDA as a condition
 25 30 of receiving a grant.  The division provides that the EDA may
 25 31 make client referrals to eligible providers.
 25 32    DIVISION IV ==== MISCELLANEOUS CHANGES.  Division IV makes
 25 33 several miscellaneous changes to other EDA programs.  The
 25 34 division amends the sales and use tax refund available under
 25 35 the workforce housing tax incentive program.  That refund
 26  1 is available for sales and use tax paid prior to project
 26  2 completion, which is currently defined to mean the first date
 26  3 upon which the average annualized production of finished
 26  4 product for the preceding 90=day period at the manufacturing
 26  5 facility operated by the eligible business is at least 50
 26  6 percent of the initial design capacity of the facility.  The
 26  7 division amends the definition of "project completion" to mean
 26  8 the date on which the EDA notifies the department of revenue
 26  9 that all applicable requirements of a workforce housing tax
 26 10 incentive program agreement are satisfied.  This provision
 26 11 takes effect upon enactment and applies retroactively to July
 26 12 1, 2014, for all workforce housing tax incentive agreements
 26 13 entered into on or after that date.
 26 14    The division allows the EDA to extend the project
 26 15 completion date for a project awarded tax incentives under the
 26 16 redevelopment tax credit program and the housing enterprise
 26 17 zone tax incentives program if the property that is the subject
 26 18 of the project suffered a catastrophic fire during the 2014
 26 19 calendar year.
       LSB 1212HV (3) 86
       mm/sc
 19 21 fee equals 0.5 percent of the value of the tax credit claimed
 19 22 pursuant to the agreement if the agreement has an aggregate tax
 19 23 credit value of $100,000 or greater.
 19 24    An eligible business that fails to comply with the
 19 25 requirements of the program or the terms of an agreement with
 19 26 the EDA may have its tax credits reduced, terminated, or
 19 27 rescinded, and may be subject to the repayment or recapture of
 19 28 claimed tax credits.
 19 29    Upon determining that all requirements of an agreement and
 19 30 the program have been fulfilled, the EDA shall issue a tax
 19 31 credit and related tax credit certificate to the eligible
 19 32 business in an amount equal to the product of $.05 multiplied
 19 33 by the number of pounds of renewable chemicals produced in Iowa
 19 34 from biomass feedstock by the eligible business during the
 19 35 calendar year.  Renewable chemicals produced by an eligible
 20  1 business prior to the effective date of the division, or
 20  2 prior to the date the business first qualifies as an eligible
 20  3 business, or after calendar year 2025, shall not qualify for
 20  4 the tax credit.
 20  5    The tax credit shall be claimed for the tax year during
 20  6 which the eligible business was issued the tax credit.  The tax
 20  7 credit may be claimed against the individual income tax and the
 20  8 corporate income tax.  The credit is refundable or may, at the
 20  9 election of the taxpayer, be carried forward for up to one tax
 20 10 year.   The tax credit shall not be transferred to any person.  A
 20 11 tax credit issued to a partnership, limited liability company,
 20 12 S corporation, cooperative organized under Code chapter 501
 20 13 and filing as a partnership for federal tax purposes, estate,
 20 14 or trust electing to have the income taxed directly to the
 20 15 individual may be claimed by the individual based upon the pro
 20 16 rata share of the individual's earnings from that entity.
 20 17    The division provides that the program is subject to the
 20 18 EDA's maximum aggregate tax credit cap of $170 million per
 20 19 fiscal year in Code section 15.119, and not more than $15
 20 20 million per fiscal year may be issued by the EDA under the
 20 21 program.  In addition, the maximum amount of tax credit that
 20 22 may be issued to an eligible business in any one calendar year
 20 23 shall not exceed $1 million or $500,000, depending on whether
 20 24 the eligible business has been operating in Iowa at the time of
 20 25 application for five or fewer years, or more than five years,
 20 26 respectively.  An eligible business shall not receive more than
 20 27 five tax credits under the program.  The EDA is required to
 20 28 issue tax credits on a first=come, first=served basis until the
 20 29 maximum amount of $15 million per fiscal year is reached.  If
 20 30 the amount of tax credits exceeds this amount in a fiscal year,
 20 31 the EDA is required to establish a wait list and give priority
 20 32 in subsequent years to the eligible businesses on the wait
 20 33 list.
 20 34    The division provides for the confidentiality of certain
 20 35 information under the program.  The identity of a tax credit
 21  1 recipient and the amount of the tax credit shall be considered
 21  2 public information under Code chapter 22 (examination of public
 21  3 records), but any other information or record in the possession
 21  4 of the EDA with respect to the program shall be presumed by
 21  5 the EDA to be a trade secret protected under Code chapter 550
 21  6 or common law and shall be kept confidential by the EDA unless
 21  7 otherwise ordered by a court.
 21  8    The division takes effect upon enactment and applies to
 21  9 renewable chemicals produced in Iowa from biomass feedstock on
 21 10 or after that date.  The division applies retroactively to tax
 21 11 years beginning on or after January 1, 2015.
 21 12    DIVISION II ==== ANGEL INVESTOR TAX CREDITS.   Division II
 21 13 makes several changes to the tax credit for investments in
 21 14 qualifying businesses and community=based seed capital funds,
 21 15 often referred to as the angel investor tax credits.  The
 21 16 division amends the purpose of the tax credit in Code section
 21 17 15E.41.  The division excludes investments in community=based
 21 18 seed capital funds from qualifying for the tax credit and
 21 19 makes several conforming amendments to remove references to
 21 20 community=based seed capital funds from the Code.
 21 21    The division modifies the amount and dollar limitation of
 21 22 the tax credit for a taxpayer.  The tax credit is increased
 21 23 from 20 percent to 25 percent of a taxpayer's equity investment
 21 24 in a qualifying business.  Under current law, a taxpayer cannot
 21 25 claim more than $50,000 of tax credit per investment in a
 21 26 qualifying business, and for each tax year a taxpayer and the
 21 27 taxpayer's affiliates cannot claim tax credits for more than
 21 28 five investments in five different qualifying businesses.  The
 21 29 division amends this dollar limitation to prohibit a natural
 21 30 person and the person's spouse, child, or sibling from claiming
 21 31 a combined amount of more than $100,000 in tax credits per tax
 21 32 year.
 21 33    The division also provides that no more than $500,000 in tax
 21 34 credits may be issued per tax year for equity investments in
 21 35 any one qualifying business.
 22  1 The division modifies the procedures for claiming the tax
 22  2 credit.  Under current law, the tax credit is not refundable
 22  3 but available for carryforward for up to five tax years.  The
 22  4 division makes the tax credit refundable for an investment
 22  5 made by a natural person, and for any other person reduces the
 22  6 carryforward period to three years.
 22  7    The division strikes a provision permitting the EDA
 22  8 to cooperate with small business development centers to
 22  9 disseminate information regarding the credits and to develop
 22 10 standard application forms, and requiring the EDA to distribute
 22 11 copies of the application forms to all community=based seed
 22 12 capital funds and potential individual investors.
 22 13    The division modifies the eligibility requirements for
 22 14 qualifying businesses.  The division strikes the requirement
 22 15 that a business have an owner that meets at least one of
 22 16 four qualifications relating to business education or
 22 17 business experience.  The division requires that a business
 22 18 be participating in an entrepreneurial assistance program,
 22 19 as defined in the division, but allows the EDA to waive this
 22 20 requirement if the business establishes that its owners,
 22 21 directors, officers, and employees have an appropriate level
 22 22 of experience such that an entrepreneurial assistance program
 22 23 would not materially change the prospects of the business.
 22 24 The EDA is allowed to consult with outside service providers
 22 25 in considering such a waiver.  The division increases from $5
 22 26 million to $10 million the maximum amount of net worth that
 22 27 a business may have to be considered a qualifying business.
 22 28 The division increases from $250,000 to $500,000 the amount of
 22 29 financing that a business must have in order to be considered a
 22 30 qualifying business, removes "near equity" from the types of
 22 31 financing that will be considered in that calculation, requires
 22 32 that the financing be secured at the time of application for
 22 33 the tax credits, and requires that the business have at least
 22 34 two investors at the time of application for the tax credits.
 22 35 These modified eligibility requirements apply to businesses
 23  1 that submit an application to the EDA to be registered as a
 23  2 qualifying business on or after the effective date of this
 23  3 division of the bill, and businesses that submitted such an
 23  4 application to the EDA before the effective date of this
 23  5 division of the bill shall be governed by current law.
 23  6    The division provides for the confidentiality of certain
 23  7 information with regard to the tax credit.  The identity of
 23  8 a qualifying business, the identity of an investor and the
 23  9 qualifying business in which the investor made an equity
 23 10 investment, and the total number and amount of tax credits
 23 11 issued shall be considered public information under Code
 23 12 chapter 22 (examination of public records), but any other
 23 13 information or record in the possession of the EDA with respect
 23 14 to the program shall be presumed by the EDA to be a trade secret
 23 15 protected under Code chapter 550 or common law and shall be
 23 16 kept confidential by the EDA unless otherwise ordered by a
 23 17 court.
 23 18    The division takes effect upon enactment and applies to
 23 19 equity investments in a qualifying business made on or after
 23 20 that date.  Equity investments in a qualifying business or
 23 21 community=based seed capital fund made prior to the effective
 23 22 date of the division shall be governed by current law.
 23 23    DIVISION III ==== ENTREPRENEUR INVESTMENT AWARDS PROGRAM.
 23 24  Division III amends the entrepreneur investment awards program
 23 25 administered by the EDA.  The division strikes provisions that
 23 26 prohibited the EDA from making awards under the program since
 23 27 July 1, 2014, and that required the EDA by December 31, 2014,
 23 28 to conduct a comprehensive review of the program and submit
 23 29 a report with specified information to the governor and the
 23 30 general assembly.
 23 31    The division modifies the purpose of the program to be
 23 32 to provide financial assistance to eligible entrepreneurial
 23 33 assistance providers (provider) that provide technical and
 23 34 financial assistance to entrepreneurs and start=up companies
 23 35 seeking to create, locate, or expand a business in Iowa.
 24  1 "Financial assistance" is defined in the division.
 24  2    The division changes the requirements for receiving an
 24  3 award.  To be eligible to receive an award under current
 24  4 law, an entrepreneurial assistance program must have been
 24  5 an Iowa=based business, expended at least $500,000 during
 24  6 the previous fiscal year to provide technical and financial
 24  7 assistance services that meet the broad=based needs of
 24  8 entrepreneurs seeking to create, locate, or expand a business
 24  9 in Iowa that intends to derive more than 10 percent of its
 24 10 gross sales from markets outside Iowa; and must have engaged
 24 11 and communicated with certain other programs, funding sources,
 24 12 and entities for its entrepreneur clients.  The division
 24 13 amends the eligibility for receiving financial assistance to
 24 14 require that a provider have its principal place of operations
 24 15 in Iowa and that the provider offer a comprehensive set of
 24 16 business development services to emerging and early=stage
 24 17 innovation companies to assist in the creation, location,
 24 18 growth, and long=term success of the company in Iowa.
 24 19 "Business development services" is defined in the division.
 24 20 Business development services may be performed at the physical
 24 21 location of the provider or the company and may be provided in
 24 22 consideration of equity participation in the company, a fee for
 24 23 services, or a membership agreement with the company.
 24 24    Under current law, the EDA board could approve, deny, or
 24 25 defer each application for a grant, and was required to award
 24 26 grants on a first=come, first=served basis.  The division
 24 27 specifies that the EDA board has the discretion to approve,
 24 28 deny, or defer each application for financial assistance and
 24 29 that the amount of financial assistance awarded to a provider
 24 30 is within the discretion of the EDA.  The division requires
 24 31 the EDA to award financial assistance on a competitive basis
 24 32 and allows the EDA to develop scoring criteria and establish
 24 33 minimum requirements for the receipt of a financial assistance
 24 34 award.
 24 35    In addition to the four factors relating to the provider's
 25  1 professional staff that the EDA may consider under current
 25  2 law in deciding whether to award financial assistance, the
 25  3 division provides that the EDA may also consider the service
 25  4 model and likelihood of success of the provider, the provider's
 25  5 similarity to other successful providers in the country, and
 25  6 the provider's financial need.
 25  7    The division modifies the maximum award amount for a
 25  8 recipient.  Under current law, a grant to an entrepreneur
 25  9 assistance program cannot exceed the lesser of 25 percent of
 25 10 the funds expended by the program during the previous fiscal
 25 11 year, 100 percent of the funds raised from certain persons
 25 12 by the program during the previous fiscal year, or $200,000.
 25 13 The division provides that the amount of financial assistance
 25 14 awarded to any one provider shall not exceed $200,000.
 25 15    The division modifies the permitted use of funds received
 25 16 under the program.  Under current law, grants are only
 25 17 permitted to be used for the purpose of operating costs
 25 18 incurred by the program.  The division specifies that financial
 25 19 assistance awarded to a provider shall only be used for
 25 20 the purpose of operating costs incurred by the provider in
 25 21 the provision of business development services to emerging
 25 22 and early=stage innovation companies in Iowa.  The division
 25 23 further requires that such financial assistance shall not be
 25 24 distributed to owners or investors of the company to which the
 25 25 business development services are being provided and shall not
 25 26 be provided to other persons assisting with the provision of
 25 27 the services.
 25 28    Under current law, an entrepreneurial assistance provider is
 25 29 required to accept client referrals from the EDA as a condition
 25 30 of receiving a grant.  The division provides that the EDA may
 25 31 make client referrals to eligible providers.
 25 32    DIVISION IV ==== MISCELLANEOUS CHANGES.  Division IV makes
 25 33 several miscellaneous changes to other EDA programs.  The
 25 34 division amends the sales and use tax refund available under
 25 35 the workforce housing tax incentive program.  That refund
 26  1 is available for sales and use tax paid prior to project
 26  2 completion, which is currently defined to mean the first date
 26  3 upon which the average annualized production of finished
 26  4 product for the preceding 90=day period at the manufacturing
 26  5 facility operated by the eligible business is at least 50
 26  6 percent of the initial design capacity of the facility.  The
 26  7 division amends the definition of "project completion" to mean
 26  8 the date on which the EDA notifies the department of revenue
 26  9 that all applicable requirements of a workforce housing tax
 26 10 incentive program agreement are satisfied.  This provision
 26 11 takes effect upon enactment and applies retroactively to July
 26 12 1, 2014, for all workforce housing tax incentive agreements
 26 13 entered into on or after that date.
 26 14    The division allows the EDA to extend the project
 26 15 completion date for a project awarded tax incentives under the
 26 16 redevelopment tax credit program and the housing enterprise
 26 17 zone tax incentives program if the property that is the subject
 26 18 of the project suffered a catastrophic fire during the 2014
 26 19 calendar year.
       LSB 1212HV (3) 86
       mm/sc
 19 22 pursuant to the agreement if the agreement has an aggregate tax
 19 23 credit value of $100,000 or greater.
 19 24    An eligible business that fails to comply with the
 19 25 requirements of the program or the terms of an agreement with
 19 26 the EDA may have its tax credits reduced, terminated, or
 19 27 rescinded, and may be subject to the repayment or recapture of
 19 28 claimed tax credits.
 19 29    Upon determining that all requirements of an agreement and
 19 30 the program have been fulfilled, the EDA shall issue a tax
 19 31 credit and related tax credit certificate to the eligible
 19 32 business in an amount equal to the product of $.05 multiplied
 19 33 by the number of pounds of renewable chemicals produced in Iowa
 19 34 from biomass feedstock by the eligible business during the
 19 35 calendar year.  Renewable chemicals produced by an eligible
 20  1 business prior to the effective date of the division, or
 20  2 prior to the date the business first qualifies as an eligible
 20  3 business, or after calendar year 2025, shall not qualify for
 20  4 the tax credit.
 20  5    The tax credit shall be claimed for the tax year during
 20  6 which the eligible business was issued the tax credit.  The tax
 20  7 credit may be claimed against the individual income tax and the
 20  8 corporate income tax.  The credit is refundable or may, at the
 20  9 election of the taxpayer, be carried forward for up to one tax
 20 10 year.   The tax credit shall not be transferred to any person.  A
 20 11 tax credit issued to a partnership, limited liability company,
 20 12 S corporation, cooperative organized under Code chapter 501
 20 13 and filing as a partnership for federal tax purposes, estate,
 20 14 or trust electing to have the income taxed directly to the
 20 15 individual may be claimed by the individual based upon the pro
 20 16 rata share of the individual's earnings from that entity.
 20 17    The division provides that the program is subject to the
 20 18 EDA's maximum aggregate tax credit cap of $170 million per
 20 19 fiscal year in Code section 15.119, and not more than $15
 20 20 million per fiscal year may be issued by the EDA under the
 20 21 program.  In addition, the maximum amount of tax credit that
 20 22 may be issued to an eligible business in any one calendar year
 20 23 shall not exceed $1 million or $500,000, depending on whether
 20 24 the eligible business has been operating in Iowa at the time of
 20 25 application for five or fewer years, or more than five years,
 20 26 respectively.  An eligible business shall not receive more than
 20 27 five tax credits under the program.  The EDA is required to
 20 28 issue tax credits on a first=come, first=served basis until the
 20 29 maximum amount of $15 million per fiscal year is reached.  If
 20 30 the amount of tax credits exceeds this amount in a fiscal year,
 20 31 the EDA is required to establish a wait list and give priority
 20 32 in subsequent years to the eligible businesses on the wait
 20 33 list.
 20 34    The division provides for the confidentiality of certain
 20 35 information under the program.  The identity of a tax credit
 21  1 recipient and the amount of the tax credit shall be considered
 21  2 public information under Code chapter 22 (examination of public
 21  3 records), but any other information or record in the possession
 21  4 of the EDA with respect to the program shall be presumed by
 21  5 the EDA to be a trade secret protected under Code chapter 550
 21  6 or common law and shall be kept confidential by the EDA unless
 21  7 otherwise ordered by a court.
 21  8    The division takes effect upon enactment and applies to
 21  9 renewable chemicals produced in Iowa from biomass feedstock on
 21 10 or after that date.  The division applies retroactively to tax
 21 11 years beginning on or after January 1, 2015.
 21 12    DIVISION II ==== ANGEL INVESTOR TAX CREDITS.   Division II
 21 13 makes several changes to the tax credit for investments in
 21 14 qualifying businesses and community=based seed capital funds,
 21 15 often referred to as the angel investor tax credits.  The
 21 16 division amends the purpose of the tax credit in Code section
 21 17 15E.41.  The division excludes investments in community=based
 21 18 seed capital funds from qualifying for the tax credit and
 21 19 makes several conforming amendments to remove references to
 21 20 community=based seed capital funds from the Code.
 21 21    The division modifies the amount and dollar limitation of
 21 22 the tax credit for a taxpayer.  The tax credit is increased
 21 23 from 20 percent to 25 percent of a taxpayer's equity investment
 21 24 in a qualifying business.  Under current law, a taxpayer cannot
 21 25 claim more than $50,000 of tax credit per investment in a
 21 26 qualifying business, and for each tax year a taxpayer and the
 21 27 taxpayer's affiliates cannot claim tax credits for more than
 21 28 five investments in five different qualifying businesses.  The
 21 29 division amends this dollar limitation to prohibit a natural
 21 30 person and the person's spouse, child, or sibling from claiming
 21 31 a combined amount of more than $100,000 in tax credits per tax
 21 32 year.
 21 33    The division also provides that no more than $500,000 in tax
 21 34 credits may be issued per tax year for equity investments in
 21 35 any one qualifying business.
 22  1 The division modifies the procedures for claiming the tax
 22  2 credit.  Under current law, the tax credit is not refundable
 22  3 but available for carryforward for up to five tax years.  The
 22  4 division makes the tax credit refundable for an investment
 22  5 made by a natural person, and for any other person reduces the
 22  6 carryforward period to three years.
 22  7    The division strikes a provision permitting the EDA
 22  8 to cooperate with small business development centers to
 22  9 disseminate information regarding the credits and to develop
 22 10 standard application forms, and requiring the EDA to distribute
 22 11 copies of the application forms to all community=based seed
 22 12 capital funds and potential individual investors.
 22 13    The division modifies the eligibility requirements for
 22 14 qualifying businesses.  The division strikes the requirement
 22 15 that a business have an owner that meets at least one of
 22 16 four qualifications relating to business education or
 22 17 business experience.  The division requires that a business
 22 18 be participating in an entrepreneurial assistance program,
 22 19 as defined in the division, but allows the EDA to waive this
 22 20 requirement if the business establishes that its owners,
 22 21 directors, officers, and employees have an appropriate level
 22 22 of experience such that an entrepreneurial assistance program
 22 23 would not materially change the prospects of the business.
 22 24 The EDA is allowed to consult with outside service providers
 22 25 in considering such a waiver.  The division increases from $5
 22 26 million to $10 million the maximum amount of net worth that
 22 27 a business may have to be considered a qualifying business.
 22 28 The division increases from $250,000 to $500,000 the amount of
 22 29 financing that a business must have in order to be considered a
 22 30 qualifying business, removes "near equity" from the types of
 22 31 financing that will be considered in that calculation, requires
 22 32 that the financing be secured at the time of application for
 22 33 the tax credits, and requires that the business have at least
 22 34 two investors at the time of application for the tax credits.
 22 35 These modified eligibility requirements apply to businesses
 23  1 that submit an application to the EDA to be registered as a
 23  2 qualifying business on or after the effective date of this
 23  3 division of the bill, and businesses that submitted such an
 23  4 application to the EDA before the effective date of this
 23  5 division of the bill shall be governed by current law.
 23  6    The division provides for the confidentiality of certain
 23  7 information with regard to the tax credit.  The identity of
 23  8 a qualifying business, the identity of an investor and the
 23  9 qualifying business in which the investor made an equity
 23 10 investment, and the total number and amount of tax credits
 23 11 issued shall be considered public information under Code
 23 12 chapter 22 (examination of public records), but any other
 23 13 information or record in the possession of the EDA with respect
 23 14 to the program shall be presumed by the EDA to be a trade secret
 23 15 protected under Code chapter 550 or common law and shall be
 23 16 kept confidential by the EDA unless otherwise ordered by a
 23 17 court.
 23 18    The division takes effect upon enactment and applies to
 23 19 equity investments in a qualifying business made on or after
 23 20 that date.  Equity investments in a qualifying business or
 23 21 community=based seed capital fund made prior to the effective
 23 22 date of the division shall be governed by current law.
 23 23    DIVISION III ==== ENTREPRENEUR INVESTMENT AWARDS PROGRAM.
 23 24  Division III amends the entrepreneur investment awards program
 23 25 administered by the EDA.  The division strikes provisions that
 23 26 prohibited the EDA from making awards under the program since
 23 27 July 1, 2014, and that required the EDA by December 31, 2014,
 23 28 to conduct a comprehensive review of the program and submit
 23 29 a report with specified information to the governor and the
 23 30 general assembly.
 23 31    The division modifies the purpose of the program to be
 23 32 to provide financial assistance to eligible entrepreneurial
 23 33 assistance providers (provider) that provide technical and
 23 34 financial assistance to entrepreneurs and start=up companies
 23 35 seeking to create, locate, or expand a business in Iowa.
 24  1 "Financial assistance" is defined in the division.
 24  2    The division changes the requirements for receiving an
 24  3 award.  To be eligible to receive an award under current
 24  4 law, an entrepreneurial assistance program must have been
 24  5 an Iowa=based business, expended at least $500,000 during
 24  6 the previous fiscal year to provide technical and financial
 24  7 assistance services that meet the broad=based needs of
 24  8 entrepreneurs seeking to create, locate, or expand a business
 24  9 in Iowa that intends to derive more than 10 percent of its
 24 10 gross sales from markets outside Iowa; and must have engaged
 24 11 and communicated with certain other programs, funding sources,
 24 12 and entities for its entrepreneur clients.  The division
 24 13 amends the eligibility for receiving financial assistance to
 24 14 require that a provider have its principal place of operations
 24 15 in Iowa and that the provider offer a comprehensive set of
 24 16 business development services to emerging and early=stage
 24 17 innovation companies to assist in the creation, location,
 24 18 growth, and long=term success of the company in Iowa.
 24 19 "Business development services" is defined in the division.
 24 20 Business development services may be performed at the physical
 24 21 location of the provider or the company and may be provided in
 24 22 consideration of equity participation in the company, a fee for
 24 23 services, or a membership agreement with the company.
 24 24    Under current law, the EDA board could approve, deny, or
 24 25 defer each application for a grant, and was required to award
 24 26 grants on a first=come, first=served basis.  The division
 24 27 specifies that the EDA board has the discretion to approve,
 24 28 deny, or defer each application for financial assistance and
 24 29 that the amount of financial assistance awarded to a provider
 24 30 is within the discretion of the EDA.  The division requires
 24 31 the EDA to award financial assistance on a competitive basis
 24 32 and allows the EDA to develop scoring criteria and establish
 24 33 minimum requirements for the receipt of a financial assistance
 24 34 award.
 24 35    In addition to the four factors relating to the provider's
 25  1 professional staff that the EDA may consider under current
 25  2 law in deciding whether to award financial assistance, the
 25  3 division provides that the EDA may also consider the service
 25  4 model and likelihood of success of the provider, the provider's
 25  5 similarity to other successful providers in the country, and
 25  6 the provider's financial need.
 25  7    The division modifies the maximum award amount for a
 25  8 recipient.  Under current law, a grant to an entrepreneur
 25  9 assistance program cannot exceed the lesser of 25 percent of
 25 10 the funds expended by the program during the previous fiscal
 25 11 year, 100 percent of the funds raised from certain persons
 25 12 by the program during the previous fiscal year, or $200,000.
 25 13 The division provides that the amount of financial assistance
 25 14 awarded to any one provider shall not exceed $200,000.
 25 15    The division modifies the permitted use of funds received
 25 16 under the program.  Under current law, grants are only
 25 17 permitted to be used for the purpose of operating costs
 25 18 incurred by the program.  The division specifies that financial
 25 19 assistance awarded to a provider shall only be used for
 25 20 the purpose of operating costs incurred by the provider in
 25 21 the provision of business development services to emerging
 25 22 and early=stage innovation companies in Iowa.  The division
 25 23 further requires that such financial assistance shall not be
 25 24 distributed to owners or investors of the company to which the
 25 25 business development services are being provided and shall not
 25 26 be provided to other persons assisting with the provision of
 25 27 the services.
 25 28    Under current law, an entrepreneurial assistance provider is
 25 29 required to accept client referrals from the EDA as a condition
 25 30 of receiving a grant.  The division provides that the EDA may
 25 31 make client referrals to eligible providers.
 25 32    DIVISION IV ==== MISCELLANEOUS CHANGES.  Division IV makes
 25 33 several miscellaneous changes to other EDA programs.  The
 25 34 division amends the sales and use tax refund available under
 25 35 the workforce housing tax incentive program.  That refund
 26  1 is available for sales and use tax paid prior to project
 26  2 completion, which is currently defined to mean the first date
 26  3 upon which the average annualized production of finished
 26  4 product for the preceding 90=day period at the manufacturing
 26  5 facility operated by the eligible business is at least 50
 26  6 percent of the initial design capacity of the facility.  The
 26  7 division amends the definition of "project completion" to mean
 26  8 the date on which the EDA notifies the department of revenue
 26  9 that all applicable requirements of a workforce housing tax
 26 10 incentive program agreement are satisfied.  This provision
 26 11 takes effect upon enactment and applies retroactively to July
 26 12 1, 2014, for all workforce housing tax incentive agreements
 26 13 entered into on or after that date.
 26 14    The division allows the EDA to extend the project
 26 15 completion date for a project awarded tax incentives under the
 26 16 redevelopment tax credit program and the housing enterprise
 26 17 zone tax incentives program if the property that is the subject
 26 18 of the project suffered a catastrophic fire during the 2014
 26 19 calendar year.
       LSB 1212HV (3) 86
       mm/sc
 19 23 credit value of $100,000 or greater.
 19 24    An eligible business that fails to comply with the
 19 25 requirements of the program or the terms of an agreement with
 19 26 the EDA may have its tax credits reduced, terminated, or
 19 27 rescinded, and may be subject to the repayment or recapture of
 19 28 claimed tax credits.
 19 29    Upon determining that all requirements of an agreement and
 19 30 the program have been fulfilled, the EDA shall issue a tax
 19 31 credit and related tax credit certificate to the eligible
 19 32 business in an amount equal to the product of $.05 multiplied
 19 33 by the number of pounds of renewable chemicals produced in Iowa
 19 34 from biomass feedstock by the eligible business during the
 19 35 calendar year.  Renewable chemicals produced by an eligible
 20  1 business prior to the effective date of the division, or
 20  2 prior to the date the business first qualifies as an eligible
 20  3 business, or after calendar year 2025, shall not qualify for
 20  4 the tax credit.
 20  5    The tax credit shall be claimed for the tax year during
 20  6 which the eligible business was issued the tax credit.  The tax
 20  7 credit may be claimed against the individual income tax and the
 20  8 corporate income tax.  The credit is refundable or may, at the
 20  9 election of the taxpayer, be carried forward for up to one tax
 20 10 year.   The tax credit shall not be transferred to any person.  A
 20 11 tax credit issued to a partnership, limited liability company,
 20 12 S corporation, cooperative organized under Code chapter 501
 20 13 and filing as a partnership for federal tax purposes, estate,
 20 14 or trust electing to have the income taxed directly to the
 20 15 individual may be claimed by the individual based upon the pro
 20 16 rata share of the individual's earnings from that entity.
 20 17    The division provides that the program is subject to the
 20 18 EDA's maximum aggregate tax credit cap of $170 million per
 20 19 fiscal year in Code section 15.119, and not more than $15
 20 20 million per fiscal year may be issued by the EDA under the
 20 21 program.  In addition, the maximum amount of tax credit that
 20 22 may be issued to an eligible business in any one calendar year
 20 23 shall not exceed $1 million or $500,000, depending on whether
 20 24 the eligible business has been operating in Iowa at the time of
 20 25 application for five or fewer years, or more than five years,
 20 26 respectively.  An eligible business shall not receive more than
 20 27 five tax credits under the program.  The EDA is required to
 20 28 issue tax credits on a first=come, first=served basis until the
 20 29 maximum amount of $15 million per fiscal year is reached.  If
 20 30 the amount of tax credits exceeds this amount in a fiscal year,
 20 31 the EDA is required to establish a wait list and give priority
 20 32 in subsequent years to the eligible businesses on the wait
 20 33 list.
 20 34    The division provides for the confidentiality of certain
 20 35 information under the program.  The identity of a tax credit
 21  1 recipient and the amount of the tax credit shall be considered
 21  2 public information under Code chapter 22 (examination of public
 21  3 records), but any other information or record in the possession
 21  4 of the EDA with respect to the program shall be presumed by
 21  5 the EDA to be a trade secret protected under Code chapter 550
 21  6 or common law and shall be kept confidential by the EDA unless
 21  7 otherwise ordered by a court.
 21  8    The division takes effect upon enactment and applies to
 21  9 renewable chemicals produced in Iowa from biomass feedstock on
 21 10 or after that date.  The division applies retroactively to tax
 21 11 years beginning on or after January 1, 2015.
 21 12    DIVISION II ==== ANGEL INVESTOR TAX CREDITS.   Division II
 21 13 makes several changes to the tax credit for investments in
 21 14 qualifying businesses and community=based seed capital funds,
 21 15 often referred to as the angel investor tax credits.  The
 21 16 division amends the purpose of the tax credit in Code section
 21 17 15E.41.  The division excludes investments in community=based
 21 18 seed capital funds from qualifying for the tax credit and
 21 19 makes several conforming amendments to remove references to
 21 20 community=based seed capital funds from the Code.
 21 21    The division modifies the amount and dollar limitation of
 21 22 the tax credit for a taxpayer.  The tax credit is increased
 21 23 from 20 percent to 25 percent of a taxpayer's equity investment
 21 24 in a qualifying business.  Under current law, a taxpayer cannot
 21 25 claim more than $50,000 of tax credit per investment in a
 21 26 qualifying business, and for each tax year a taxpayer and the
 21 27 taxpayer's affiliates cannot claim tax credits for more than
 21 28 five investments in five different qualifying businesses.  The
 21 29 division amends this dollar limitation to prohibit a natural
 21 30 person and the person's spouse, child, or sibling from claiming
 21 31 a combined amount of more than $100,000 in tax credits per tax
 21 32 year.
 21 33    The division also provides that no more than $500,000 in tax
 21 34 credits may be issued per tax year for equity investments in
 21 35 any one qualifying business.
 22  1 The division modifies the procedures for claiming the tax
 22  2 credit.  Under current law, the tax credit is not refundable
 22  3 but available for carryforward for up to five tax years.  The
 22  4 division makes the tax credit refundable for an investment
 22  5 made by a natural person, and for any other person reduces the
 22  6 carryforward period to three years.
 22  7    The division strikes a provision permitting the EDA
 22  8 to cooperate with small business development centers to
 22  9 disseminate information regarding the credits and to develop
 22 10 standard application forms, and requiring the EDA to distribute
 22 11 copies of the application forms to all community=based seed
 22 12 capital funds and potential individual investors.
 22 13    The division modifies the eligibility requirements for
 22 14 qualifying businesses.  The division strikes the requirement
 22 15 that a business have an owner that meets at least one of
 22 16 four qualifications relating to business education or
 22 17 business experience.  The division requires that a business
 22 18 be participating in an entrepreneurial assistance program,
 22 19 as defined in the division, but allows the EDA to waive this
 22 20 requirement if the business establishes that its owners,
 22 21 directors, officers, and employees have an appropriate level
 22 22 of experience such that an entrepreneurial assistance program
 22 23 would not materially change the prospects of the business.
 22 24 The EDA is allowed to consult with outside service providers
 22 25 in considering such a waiver.  The division increases from $5
 22 26 million to $10 million the maximum amount of net worth that
 22 27 a business may have to be considered a qualifying business.
 22 28 The division increases from $250,000 to $500,000 the amount of
 22 29 financing that a business must have in order to be considered a
 22 30 qualifying business, removes "near equity" from the types of
 22 31 financing that will be considered in that calculation, requires
 22 32 that the financing be secured at the time of application for
 22 33 the tax credits, and requires that the business have at least
 22 34 two investors at the time of application for the tax credits.
 22 35 These modified eligibility requirements apply to businesses
 23  1 that submit an application to the EDA to be registered as a
 23  2 qualifying business on or after the effective date of this
 23  3 division of the bill, and businesses that submitted such an
 23  4 application to the EDA before the effective date of this
 23  5 division of the bill shall be governed by current law.
 23  6    The division provides for the confidentiality of certain
 23  7 information with regard to the tax credit.  The identity of
 23  8 a qualifying business, the identity of an investor and the
 23  9 qualifying business in which the investor made an equity
 23 10 investment, and the total number and amount of tax credits
 23 11 issued shall be considered public information under Code
 23 12 chapter 22 (examination of public records), but any other
 23 13 information or record in the possession of the EDA with respect
 23 14 to the program shall be presumed by the EDA to be a trade secret
 23 15 protected under Code chapter 550 or common law and shall be
 23 16 kept confidential by the EDA unless otherwise ordered by a
 23 17 court.
 23 18    The division takes effect upon enactment and applies to
 23 19 equity investments in a qualifying business made on or after
 23 20 that date.  Equity investments in a qualifying business or
 23 21 community=based seed capital fund made prior to the effective
 23 22 date of the division shall be governed by current law.
 23 23    DIVISION III ==== ENTREPRENEUR INVESTMENT AWARDS PROGRAM.
 23 24  Division III amends the entrepreneur investment awards program
 23 25 administered by the EDA.  The division strikes provisions that
 23 26 prohibited the EDA from making awards under the program since
 23 27 July 1, 2014, and that required the EDA by December 31, 2014,
 23 28 to conduct a comprehensive review of the program and submit
 23 29 a report with specified information to the governor and the
 23 30 general assembly.
 23 31    The division modifies the purpose of the program to be
 23 32 to provide financial assistance to eligible entrepreneurial
 23 33 assistance providers (provider) that provide technical and
 23 34 financial assistance to entrepreneurs and start=up companies
 23 35 seeking to create, locate, or expand a business in Iowa.
 24  1 "Financial assistance" is defined in the division.
 24  2    The division changes the requirements for receiving an
 24  3 award.  To be eligible to receive an award under current
 24  4 law, an entrepreneurial assistance program must have been
 24  5 an Iowa=based business, expended at least $500,000 during
 24  6 the previous fiscal year to provide technical and financial
 24  7 assistance services that meet the broad=based needs of
 24  8 entrepreneurs seeking to create, locate, or expand a business
 24  9 in Iowa that intends to derive more than 10 percent of its
 24 10 gross sales from markets outside Iowa; and must have engaged
 24 11 and communicated with certain other programs, funding sources,
 24 12 and entities for its entrepreneur clients.  The division
 24 13 amends the eligibility for receiving financial assistance to
 24 14 require that a provider have its principal place of operations
 24 15 in Iowa and that the provider offer a comprehensive set of
 24 16 business development services to emerging and early=stage
 24 17 innovation companies to assist in the creation, location,
 24 18 growth, and long=term success of the company in Iowa.
 24 19 "Business development services" is defined in the division.
 24 20 Business development services may be performed at the physical
 24 21 location of the provider or the company and may be provided in
 24 22 consideration of equity participation in the company, a fee for
 24 23 services, or a membership agreement with the company.
 24 24    Under current law, the EDA board could approve, deny, or
 24 25 defer each application for a grant, and was required to award
 24 26 grants on a first=come, first=served basis.  The division
 24 27 specifies that the EDA board has the discretion to approve,
 24 28 deny, or defer each application for financial assistance and
 24 29 that the amount of financial assistance awarded to a provider
 24 30 is within the discretion of the EDA.  The division requires
 24 31 the EDA to award financial assistance on a competitive basis
 24 32 and allows the EDA to develop scoring criteria and establish
 24 33 minimum requirements for the receipt of a financial assistance
 24 34 award.
 24 35    In addition to the four factors relating to the provider's
 25  1 professional staff that the EDA may consider under current
 25  2 law in deciding whether to award financial assistance, the
 25  3 division provides that the EDA may also consider the service
 25  4 model and likelihood of success of the provider, the provider's
 25  5 similarity to other successful providers in the country, and
 25  6 the provider's financial need.
 25  7    The division modifies the maximum award amount for a
 25  8 recipient.  Under current law, a grant to an entrepreneur
 25  9 assistance program cannot exceed the lesser of 25 percent of
 25 10 the funds expended by the program during the previous fiscal
 25 11 year, 100 percent of the funds raised from certain persons
 25 12 by the program during the previous fiscal year, or $200,000.
 25 13 The division provides that the amount of financial assistance
 25 14 awarded to any one provider shall not exceed $200,000.
 25 15    The division modifies the permitted use of funds received
 25 16 under the program.  Under current law, grants are only
 25 17 permitted to be used for the purpose of operating costs
 25 18 incurred by the program.  The division specifies that financial
 25 19 assistance awarded to a provider shall only be used for
 25 20 the purpose of operating costs incurred by the provider in
 25 21 the provision of business development services to emerging
 25 22 and early=stage innovation companies in Iowa.  The division
 25 23 further requires that such financial assistance shall not be
 25 24 distributed to owners or investors of the company to which the
 25 25 business development services are being provided and shall not
 25 26 be provided to other persons assisting with the provision of
 25 27 the services.
 25 28    Under current law, an entrepreneurial assistance provider is
 25 29 required to accept client referrals from the EDA as a condition
 25 30 of receiving a grant.  The division provides that the EDA may
 25 31 make client referrals to eligible providers.
 25 32    DIVISION IV ==== MISCELLANEOUS CHANGES.  Division IV makes
 25 33 several miscellaneous changes to other EDA programs.  The
 25 34 division amends the sales and use tax refund available under
 25 35 the workforce housing tax incentive program.  That refund
 26  1 is available for sales and use tax paid prior to project
 26  2 completion, which is currently defined to mean the first date
 26  3 upon which the average annualized production of finished
 26  4 product for the preceding 90=day period at the manufacturing
 26  5 facility operated by the eligible business is at least 50
 26  6 percent of the initial design capacity of the facility.  The
 26  7 division amends the definition of "project completion" to mean
 26  8 the date on which the EDA notifies the department of revenue
 26  9 that all applicable requirements of a workforce housing tax
 26 10 incentive program agreement are satisfied.  This provision
 26 11 takes effect upon enactment and applies retroactively to July
 26 12 1, 2014, for all workforce housing tax incentive agreements
 26 13 entered into on or after that date.
 26 14    The division allows the EDA to extend the project
 26 15 completion date for a project awarded tax incentives under the
 26 16 redevelopment tax credit program and the housing enterprise
 26 17 zone tax incentives program if the property that is the subject
 26 18 of the project suffered a catastrophic fire during the 2014
 26 19 calendar year.
       LSB 1212HV (3) 86
       mm/sc
 19 24    An eligible business that fails to comply with the
 19 25 requirements of the program or the terms of an agreement with
 19 26 the EDA may have its tax credits reduced, terminated, or
 19 27 rescinded, and may be subject to the repayment or recapture of
 19 28 claimed tax credits.
 19 29    Upon determining that all requirements of an agreement and
 19 30 the program have been fulfilled, the EDA shall issue a tax
 19 31 credit and related tax credit certificate to the eligible
 19 32 business in an amount equal to the product of $.05 multiplied
 19 33 by the number of pounds of renewable chemicals produced in Iowa
 19 34 from biomass feedstock by the eligible business during the
 19 35 calendar year.  Renewable chemicals produced by an eligible
 20  1 business prior to the effective date of the division, or
 20  2 prior to the date the business first qualifies as an eligible
 20  3 business, or after calendar year 2025, shall not qualify for
 20  4 the tax credit.
 20  5    The tax credit shall be claimed for the tax year during
 20  6 which the eligible business was issued the tax credit.  The tax
 20  7 credit may be claimed against the individual income tax and the
 20  8 corporate income tax.  The credit is refundable or may, at the
 20  9 election of the taxpayer, be carried forward for up to one tax
 20 10 year.   The tax credit shall not be transferred to any person.  A
 20 11 tax credit issued to a partnership, limited liability company,
 20 12 S corporation, cooperative organized under Code chapter 501
 20 13 and filing as a partnership for federal tax purposes, estate,
 20 14 or trust electing to have the income taxed directly to the
 20 15 individual may be claimed by the individual based upon the pro
 20 16 rata share of the individual's earnings from that entity.
 20 17    The division provides that the program is subject to the
 20 18 EDA's maximum aggregate tax credit cap of $170 million per
 20 19 fiscal year in Code section 15.119, and not more than $15
 20 20 million per fiscal year may be issued by the EDA under the
 20 21 program.  In addition, the maximum amount of tax credit that
 20 22 may be issued to an eligible business in any one calendar year
 20 23 shall not exceed $1 million or $500,000, depending on whether
 20 24 the eligible business has been operating in Iowa at the time of
 20 25 application for five or fewer years, or more than five years,
 20 26 respectively.  An eligible business shall not receive more than
 20 27 five tax credits under the program.  The EDA is required to
 20 28 issue tax credits on a first=come, first=served basis until the
 20 29 maximum amount of $15 million per fiscal year is reached.  If
 20 30 the amount of tax credits exceeds this amount in a fiscal year,
 20 31 the EDA is required to establish a wait list and give priority
 20 32 in subsequent years to the eligible businesses on the wait
 20 33 list.
 20 34    The division provides for the confidentiality of certain
 20 35 information under the program.  The identity of a tax credit
 21  1 recipient and the amount of the tax credit shall be considered
 21  2 public information under Code chapter 22 (examination of public
 21  3 records), but any other information or record in the possession
 21  4 of the EDA with respect to the program shall be presumed by
 21  5 the EDA to be a trade secret protected under Code chapter 550
 21  6 or common law and shall be kept confidential by the EDA unless
 21  7 otherwise ordered by a court.
 21  8    The division takes effect upon enactment and applies to
 21  9 renewable chemicals produced in Iowa from biomass feedstock on
 21 10 or after that date.  The division applies retroactively to tax
 21 11 years beginning on or after January 1, 2015.
 21 12    DIVISION II ==== ANGEL INVESTOR TAX CREDITS.   Division II
 21 13 makes several changes to the tax credit for investments in
 21 14 qualifying businesses and community=based seed capital funds,
 21 15 often referred to as the angel investor tax credits.  The
 21 16 division amends the purpose of the tax credit in Code section
 21 17 15E.41.  The division excludes investments in community=based
 21 18 seed capital funds from qualifying for the tax credit and
 21 19 makes several conforming amendments to remove references to
 21 20 community=based seed capital funds from the Code.
 21 21    The division modifies the amount and dollar limitation of
 21 22 the tax credit for a taxpayer.  The tax credit is increased
 21 23 from 20 percent to 25 percent of a taxpayer's equity investment
 21 24 in a qualifying business.  Under current law, a taxpayer cannot
 21 25 claim more than $50,000 of tax credit per investment in a
 21 26 qualifying business, and for each tax year a taxpayer and the
 21 27 taxpayer's affiliates cannot claim tax credits for more than
 21 28 five investments in five different qualifying businesses.  The
 21 29 division amends this dollar limitation to prohibit a natural
 21 30 person and the person's spouse, child, or sibling from claiming
 21 31 a combined amount of more than $100,000 in tax credits per tax
 21 32 year.
 21 33    The division also provides that no more than $500,000 in tax
 21 34 credits may be issued per tax year for equity investments in
 21 35 any one qualifying business.
 22  1 The division modifies the procedures for claiming the tax
 22  2 credit.  Under current law, the tax credit is not refundable
 22  3 but available for carryforward for up to five tax years.  The
 22  4 division makes the tax credit refundable for an investment
 22  5 made by a natural person, and for any other person reduces the
 22  6 carryforward period to three years.
 22  7    The division strikes a provision permitting the EDA
 22  8 to cooperate with small business development centers to
 22  9 disseminate information regarding the credits and to develop
 22 10 standard application forms, and requiring the EDA to distribute
 22 11 copies of the application forms to all community=based seed
 22 12 capital funds and potential individual investors.
 22 13    The division modifies the eligibility requirements for
 22 14 qualifying businesses.  The division strikes the requirement
 22 15 that a business have an owner that meets at least one of
 22 16 four qualifications relating to business education or
 22 17 business experience.  The division requires that a business
 22 18 be participating in an entrepreneurial assistance program,
 22 19 as defined in the division, but allows the EDA to waive this
 22 20 requirement if the business establishes that its owners,
 22 21 directors, officers, and employees have an appropriate level
 22 22 of experience such that an entrepreneurial assistance program
 22 23 would not materially change the prospects of the business.
 22 24 The EDA is allowed to consult with outside service providers
 22 25 in considering such a waiver.  The division increases from $5
 22 26 million to $10 million the maximum amount of net worth that
 22 27 a business may have to be considered a qualifying business.
 22 28 The division increases from $250,000 to $500,000 the amount of
 22 29 financing that a business must have in order to be considered a
 22 30 qualifying business, removes "near equity" from the types of
 22 31 financing that will be considered in that calculation, requires
 22 32 that the financing be secured at the time of application for
 22 33 the tax credits, and requires that the business have at least
 22 34 two investors at the time of application for the tax credits.
 22 35 These modified eligibility requirements apply to businesses
 23  1 that submit an application to the EDA to be registered as a
 23  2 qualifying business on or after the effective date of this
 23  3 division of the bill, and businesses that submitted such an
 23  4 application to the EDA before the effective date of this
 23  5 division of the bill shall be governed by current law.
 23  6    The division provides for the confidentiality of certain
 23  7 information with regard to the tax credit.  The identity of
 23  8 a qualifying business, the identity of an investor and the
 23  9 qualifying business in which the investor made an equity
 23 10 investment, and the total number and amount of tax credits
 23 11 issued shall be considered public information under Code
 23 12 chapter 22 (examination of public records), but any other
 23 13 information or record in the possession of the EDA with respect
 23 14 to the program shall be presumed by the EDA to be a trade secret
 23 15 protected under Code chapter 550 or common law and shall be
 23 16 kept confidential by the EDA unless otherwise ordered by a
 23 17 court.
 23 18    The division takes effect upon enactment and applies to
 23 19 equity investments in a qualifying business made on or after
 23 20 that date.  Equity investments in a qualifying business or
 23 21 community=based seed capital fund made prior to the effective
 23 22 date of the division shall be governed by current law.
 23 23    DIVISION III ==== ENTREPRENEUR INVESTMENT AWARDS PROGRAM.
 23 24  Division III amends the entrepreneur investment awards program
 23 25 administered by the EDA.  The division strikes provisions that
 23 26 prohibited the EDA from making awards under the program since
 23 27 July 1, 2014, and that required the EDA by December 31, 2014,
 23 28 to conduct a comprehensive review of the program and submit
 23 29 a report with specified information to the governor and the
 23 30 general assembly.
 23 31    The division modifies the purpose of the program to be
 23 32 to provide financial assistance to eligible entrepreneurial
 23 33 assistance providers (provider) that provide technical and
 23 34 financial assistance to entrepreneurs and start=up companies
 23 35 seeking to create, locate, or expand a business in Iowa.
 24  1 "Financial assistance" is defined in the division.
 24  2    The division changes the requirements for receiving an
 24  3 award.  To be eligible to receive an award under current
 24  4 law, an entrepreneurial assistance program must have been
 24  5 an Iowa=based business, expended at least $500,000 during
 24  6 the previous fiscal year to provide technical and financial
 24  7 assistance services that meet the broad=based needs of
 24  8 entrepreneurs seeking to create, locate, or expand a business
 24  9 in Iowa that intends to derive more than 10 percent of its
 24 10 gross sales from markets outside Iowa; and must have engaged
 24 11 and communicated with certain other programs, funding sources,
 24 12 and entities for its entrepreneur clients.  The division
 24 13 amends the eligibility for receiving financial assistance to
 24 14 require that a provider have its principal place of operations
 24 15 in Iowa and that the provider offer a comprehensive set of
 24 16 business development services to emerging and early=stage
 24 17 innovation companies to assist in the creation, location,
 24 18 growth, and long=term success of the company in Iowa.
 24 19 "Business development services" is defined in the division.
 24 20 Business development services may be performed at the physical
 24 21 location of the provider or the company and may be provided in
 24 22 consideration of equity participation in the company, a fee for
 24 23 services, or a membership agreement with the company.
 24 24    Under current law, the EDA board could approve, deny, or
 24 25 defer each application for a grant, and was required to award
 24 26 grants on a first=come, first=served basis.  The division
 24 27 specifies that the EDA board has the discretion to approve,
 24 28 deny, or defer each application for financial assistance and
 24 29 that the amount of financial assistance awarded to a provider
 24 30 is within the discretion of the EDA.  The division requires
 24 31 the EDA to award financial assistance on a competitive basis
 24 32 and allows the EDA to develop scoring criteria and establish
 24 33 minimum requirements for the receipt of a financial assistance
 24 34 award.
 24 35    In addition to the four factors relating to the provider's
 25  1 professional staff that the EDA may consider under current
 25  2 law in deciding whether to award financial assistance, the
 25  3 division provides that the EDA may also consider the service
 25  4 model and likelihood of success of the provider, the provider's
 25  5 similarity to other successful providers in the country, and
 25  6 the provider's financial need.
 25  7    The division modifies the maximum award amount for a
 25  8 recipient.  Under current law, a grant to an entrepreneur
 25  9 assistance program cannot exceed the lesser of 25 percent of
 25 10 the funds expended by the program during the previous fiscal
 25 11 year, 100 percent of the funds raised from certain persons
 25 12 by the program during the previous fiscal year, or $200,000.
 25 13 The division provides that the amount of financial assistance
 25 14 awarded to any one provider shall not exceed $200,000.
 25 15    The division modifies the permitted use of funds received
 25 16 under the program.  Under current law, grants are only
 25 17 permitted to be used for the purpose of operating costs
 25 18 incurred by the program.  The division specifies that financial
 25 19 assistance awarded to a provider shall only be used for
 25 20 the purpose of operating costs incurred by the provider in
 25 21 the provision of business development services to emerging
 25 22 and early=stage innovation companies in Iowa.  The division
 25 23 further requires that such financial assistance shall not be
 25 24 distributed to owners or investors of the company to which the
 25 25 business development services are being provided and shall not
 25 26 be provided to other persons assisting with the provision of
 25 27 the services.
 25 28    Under current law, an entrepreneurial assistance provider is
 25 29 required to accept client referrals from the EDA as a condition
 25 30 of receiving a grant.  The division provides that the EDA may
 25 31 make client referrals to eligible providers.
 25 32    DIVISION IV ==== MISCELLANEOUS CHANGES.  Division IV makes
 25 33 several miscellaneous changes to other EDA programs.  The
 25 34 division amends the sales and use tax refund available under
 25 35 the workforce housing tax incentive program.  That refund
 26  1 is available for sales and use tax paid prior to project
 26  2 completion, which is currently defined to mean the first date
 26  3 upon which the average annualized production of finished
 26  4 product for the preceding 90=day period at the manufacturing
 26  5 facility operated by the eligible business is at least 50
 26  6 percent of the initial design capacity of the facility.  The
 26  7 division amends the definition of "project completion" to mean
 26  8 the date on which the EDA notifies the department of revenue
 26  9 that all applicable requirements of a workforce housing tax
 26 10 incentive program agreement are satisfied.  This provision
 26 11 takes effect upon enactment and applies retroactively to July
 26 12 1, 2014, for all workforce housing tax incentive agreements
 26 13 entered into on or after that date.
 26 14    The division allows the EDA to extend the project
 26 15 completion date for a project awarded tax incentives under the
 26 16 redevelopment tax credit program and the housing enterprise
 26 17 zone tax incentives program if the property that is the subject
 26 18 of the project suffered a catastrophic fire during the 2014
 26 19 calendar year.
       LSB 1212HV (3) 86
       mm/sc
 19 25 requirements of the program or the terms of an agreement with
 19 26 the EDA may have its tax credits reduced, terminated, or
 19 27 rescinded, and may be subject to the repayment or recapture of
 19 28 claimed tax credits.
 19 29    Upon determining that all requirements of an agreement and
 19 30 the program have been fulfilled, the EDA shall issue a tax
 19 31 credit and related tax credit certificate to the eligible
 19 32 business in an amount equal to the product of $.05 multiplied
 19 33 by the number of pounds of renewable chemicals produced in Iowa
 19 34 from biomass feedstock by the eligible business during the
 19 35 calendar year.  Renewable chemicals produced by an eligible
 20  1 business prior to the effective date of the division, or
 20  2 prior to the date the business first qualifies as an eligible
 20  3 business, or after calendar year 2025, shall not qualify for
 20  4 the tax credit.
 20  5    The tax credit shall be claimed for the tax year during
 20  6 which the eligible business was issued the tax credit.  The tax
 20  7 credit may be claimed against the individual income tax and the
 20  8 corporate income tax.  The credit is refundable or may, at the
 20  9 election of the taxpayer, be carried forward for up to one tax
 20 10 year.   The tax credit shall not be transferred to any person.  A
 20 11 tax credit issued to a partnership, limited liability company,
 20 12 S corporation, cooperative organized under Code chapter 501
 20 13 and filing as a partnership for federal tax purposes, estate,
 20 14 or trust electing to have the income taxed directly to the
 20 15 individual may be claimed by the individual based upon the pro
 20 16 rata share of the individual's earnings from that entity.
 20 17    The division provides that the program is subject to the
 20 18 EDA's maximum aggregate tax credit cap of $170 million per
 20 19 fiscal year in Code section 15.119, and not more than $15
 20 20 million per fiscal year may be issued by the EDA under the
 20 21 program.  In addition, the maximum amount of tax credit that
 20 22 may be issued to an eligible business in any one calendar year
 20 23 shall not exceed $1 million or $500,000, depending on whether
 20 24 the eligible business has been operating in Iowa at the time of
 20 25 application for five or fewer years, or more than five years,
 20 26 respectively.  An eligible business shall not receive more than
 20 27 five tax credits under the program.  The EDA is required to
 20 28 issue tax credits on a first=come, first=served basis until the
 20 29 maximum amount of $15 million per fiscal year is reached.  If
 20 30 the amount of tax credits exceeds this amount in a fiscal year,
 20 31 the EDA is required to establish a wait list and give priority
 20 32 in subsequent years to the eligible businesses on the wait
 20 33 list.
 20 34    The division provides for the confidentiality of certain
 20 35 information under the program.  The identity of a tax credit
 21  1 recipient and the amount of the tax credit shall be considered
 21  2 public information under Code chapter 22 (examination of public
 21  3 records), but any other information or record in the possession
 21  4 of the EDA with respect to the program shall be presumed by
 21  5 the EDA to be a trade secret protected under Code chapter 550
 21  6 or common law and shall be kept confidential by the EDA unless
 21  7 otherwise ordered by a court.
 21  8    The division takes effect upon enactment and applies to
 21  9 renewable chemicals produced in Iowa from biomass feedstock on
 21 10 or after that date.  The division applies retroactively to tax
 21 11 years beginning on or after January 1, 2015.
 21 12    DIVISION II ==== ANGEL INVESTOR TAX CREDITS.   Division II
 21 13 makes several changes to the tax credit for investments in
 21 14 qualifying businesses and community=based seed capital funds,
 21 15 often referred to as the angel investor tax credits.  The
 21 16 division amends the purpose of the tax credit in Code section
 21 17 15E.41.  The division excludes investments in community=based
 21 18 seed capital funds from qualifying for the tax credit and
 21 19 makes several conforming amendments to remove references to
 21 20 community=based seed capital funds from the Code.
 21 21    The division modifies the amount and dollar limitation of
 21 22 the tax credit for a taxpayer.  The tax credit is increased
 21 23 from 20 percent to 25 percent of a taxpayer's equity investment
 21 24 in a qualifying business.  Under current law, a taxpayer cannot
 21 25 claim more than $50,000 of tax credit per investment in a
 21 26 qualifying business, and for each tax year a taxpayer and the
 21 27 taxpayer's affiliates cannot claim tax credits for more than
 21 28 five investments in five different qualifying businesses.  The
 21 29 division amends this dollar limitation to prohibit a natural
 21 30 person and the person's spouse, child, or sibling from claiming
 21 31 a combined amount of more than $100,000 in tax credits per tax
 21 32 year.
 21 33    The division also provides that no more than $500,000 in tax
 21 34 credits may be issued per tax year for equity investments in
 21 35 any one qualifying business.
 22  1 The division modifies the procedures for claiming the tax
 22  2 credit.  Under current law, the tax credit is not refundable
 22  3 but available for carryforward for up to five tax years.  The
 22  4 division makes the tax credit refundable for an investment
 22  5 made by a natural person, and for any other person reduces the
 22  6 carryforward period to three years.
 22  7    The division strikes a provision permitting the EDA
 22  8 to cooperate with small business development centers to
 22  9 disseminate information regarding the credits and to develop
 22 10 standard application forms, and requiring the EDA to distribute
 22 11 copies of the application forms to all community=based seed
 22 12 capital funds and potential individual investors.
 22 13    The division modifies the eligibility requirements for
 22 14 qualifying businesses.  The division strikes the requirement
 22 15 that a business have an owner that meets at least one of
 22 16 four qualifications relating to business education or
 22 17 business experience.  The division requires that a business
 22 18 be participating in an entrepreneurial assistance program,
 22 19 as defined in the division, but allows the EDA to waive this
 22 20 requirement if the business establishes that its owners,
 22 21 directors, officers, and employees have an appropriate level
 22 22 of experience such that an entrepreneurial assistance program
 22 23 would not materially change the prospects of the business.
 22 24 The EDA is allowed to consult with outside service providers
 22 25 in considering such a waiver.  The division increases from $5
 22 26 million to $10 million the maximum amount of net worth that
 22 27 a business may have to be considered a qualifying business.
 22 28 The division increases from $250,000 to $500,000 the amount of
 22 29 financing that a business must have in order to be considered a
 22 30 qualifying business, removes "near equity" from the types of
 22 31 financing that will be considered in that calculation, requires
 22 32 that the financing be secured at the time of application for
 22 33 the tax credits, and requires that the business have at least
 22 34 two investors at the time of application for the tax credits.
 22 35 These modified eligibility requirements apply to businesses
 23  1 that submit an application to the EDA to be registered as a
 23  2 qualifying business on or after the effective date of this
 23  3 division of the bill, and businesses that submitted such an
 23  4 application to the EDA before the effective date of this
 23  5 division of the bill shall be governed by current law.
 23  6    The division provides for the confidentiality of certain
 23  7 information with regard to the tax credit.  The identity of
 23  8 a qualifying business, the identity of an investor and the
 23  9 qualifying business in which the investor made an equity
 23 10 investment, and the total number and amount of tax credits
 23 11 issued shall be considered public information under Code
 23 12 chapter 22 (examination of public records), but any other
 23 13 information or record in the possession of the EDA with respect
 23 14 to the program shall be presumed by the EDA to be a trade secret
 23 15 protected under Code chapter 550 or common law and shall be
 23 16 kept confidential by the EDA unless otherwise ordered by a
 23 17 court.
 23 18    The division takes effect upon enactment and applies to
 23 19 equity investments in a qualifying business made on or after
 23 20 that date.  Equity investments in a qualifying business or
 23 21 community=based seed capital fund made prior to the effective
 23 22 date of the division shall be governed by current law.
 23 23    DIVISION III ==== ENTREPRENEUR INVESTMENT AWARDS PROGRAM.
 23 24  Division III amends the entrepreneur investment awards program
 23 25 administered by the EDA.  The division strikes provisions that
 23 26 prohibited the EDA from making awards under the program since
 23 27 July 1, 2014, and that required the EDA by December 31, 2014,
 23 28 to conduct a comprehensive review of the program and submit
 23 29 a report with specified information to the governor and the
 23 30 general assembly.
 23 31    The division modifies the purpose of the program to be
 23 32 to provide financial assistance to eligible entrepreneurial
 23 33 assistance providers (provider) that provide technical and
 23 34 financial assistance to entrepreneurs and start=up companies
 23 35 seeking to create, locate, or expand a business in Iowa.
 24  1 "Financial assistance" is defined in the division.
 24  2    The division changes the requirements for receiving an
 24  3 award.  To be eligible to receive an award under current
 24  4 law, an entrepreneurial assistance program must have been
 24  5 an Iowa=based business, expended at least $500,000 during
 24  6 the previous fiscal year to provide technical and financial
 24  7 assistance services that meet the broad=based needs of
 24  8 entrepreneurs seeking to create, locate, or expand a business
 24  9 in Iowa that intends to derive more than 10 percent of its
 24 10 gross sales from markets outside Iowa; and must have engaged
 24 11 and communicated with certain other programs, funding sources,
 24 12 and entities for its entrepreneur clients.  The division
 24 13 amends the eligibility for receiving financial assistance to
 24 14 require that a provider have its principal place of operations
 24 15 in Iowa and that the provider offer a comprehensive set of
 24 16 business development services to emerging and early=stage
 24 17 innovation companies to assist in the creation, location,
 24 18 growth, and long=term success of the company in Iowa.
 24 19 "Business development services" is defined in the division.
 24 20 Business development services may be performed at the physical
 24 21 location of the provider or the company and may be provided in
 24 22 consideration of equity participation in the company, a fee for
 24 23 services, or a membership agreement with the company.
 24 24    Under current law, the EDA board could approve, deny, or
 24 25 defer each application for a grant, and was required to award
 24 26 grants on a first=come, first=served basis.  The division
 24 27 specifies that the EDA board has the discretion to approve,
 24 28 deny, or defer each application for financial assistance and
 24 29 that the amount of financial assistance awarded to a provider
 24 30 is within the discretion of the EDA.  The division requires
 24 31 the EDA to award financial assistance on a competitive basis
 24 32 and allows the EDA to develop scoring criteria and establish
 24 33 minimum requirements for the receipt of a financial assistance
 24 34 award.
 24 35    In addition to the four factors relating to the provider's
 25  1 professional staff that the EDA may consider under current
 25  2 law in deciding whether to award financial assistance, the
 25  3 division provides that the EDA may also consider the service
 25  4 model and likelihood of success of the provider, the provider's
 25  5 similarity to other successful providers in the country, and
 25  6 the provider's financial need.
 25  7    The division modifies the maximum award amount for a
 25  8 recipient.  Under current law, a grant to an entrepreneur
 25  9 assistance program cannot exceed the lesser of 25 percent of
 25 10 the funds expended by the program during the previous fiscal
 25 11 year, 100 percent of the funds raised from certain persons
 25 12 by the program during the previous fiscal year, or $200,000.
 25 13 The division provides that the amount of financial assistance
 25 14 awarded to any one provider shall not exceed $200,000.
 25 15    The division modifies the permitted use of funds received
 25 16 under the program.  Under current law, grants are only
 25 17 permitted to be used for the purpose of operating costs
 25 18 incurred by the program.  The division specifies that financial
 25 19 assistance awarded to a provider shall only be used for
 25 20 the purpose of operating costs incurred by the provider in
 25 21 the provision of business development services to emerging
 25 22 and early=stage innovation companies in Iowa.  The division
 25 23 further requires that such financial assistance shall not be
 25 24 distributed to owners or investors of the company to which the
 25 25 business development services are being provided and shall not
 25 26 be provided to other persons assisting with the provision of
 25 27 the services.
 25 28    Under current law, an entrepreneurial assistance provider is
 25 29 required to accept client referrals from the EDA as a condition
 25 30 of receiving a grant.  The division provides that the EDA may
 25 31 make client referrals to eligible providers.
 25 32    DIVISION IV ==== MISCELLANEOUS CHANGES.  Division IV makes
 25 33 several miscellaneous changes to other EDA programs.  The
 25 34 division amends the sales and use tax refund available under
 25 35 the workforce housing tax incentive program.  That refund
 26  1 is available for sales and use tax paid prior to project
 26  2 completion, which is currently defined to mean the first date
 26  3 upon which the average annualized production of finished
 26  4 product for the preceding 90=day period at the manufacturing
 26  5 facility operated by the eligible business is at least 50
 26  6 percent of the initial design capacity of the facility.  The
 26  7 division amends the definition of "project completion" to mean
 26  8 the date on which the EDA notifies the department of revenue
 26  9 that all applicable requirements of a workforce housing tax
 26 10 incentive program agreement are satisfied.  This provision
 26 11 takes effect upon enactment and applies retroactively to July
 26 12 1, 2014, for all workforce housing tax incentive agreements
 26 13 entered into on or after that date.
 26 14    The division allows the EDA to extend the project
 26 15 completion date for a project awarded tax incentives under the
 26 16 redevelopment tax credit program and the housing enterprise
 26 17 zone tax incentives program if the property that is the subject
 26 18 of the project suffered a catastrophic fire during the 2014
 26 19 calendar year.
       LSB 1212HV (3) 86
       mm/sc
 19 26 the EDA may have its tax credits reduced, terminated, or
 19 27 rescinded, and may be subject to the repayment or recapture of
 19 28 claimed tax credits.
 19 29    Upon determining that all requirements of an agreement and
 19 30 the program have been fulfilled, the EDA shall issue a tax
 19 31 credit and related tax credit certificate to the eligible
 19 32 business in an amount equal to the product of $.05 multiplied
 19 33 by the number of pounds of renewable chemicals produced in Iowa
 19 34 from biomass feedstock by the eligible business during the
 19 35 calendar year.  Renewable chemicals produced by an eligible
 20  1 business prior to the effective date of the division, or
 20  2 prior to the date the business first qualifies as an eligible
 20  3 business, or after calendar year 2025, shall not qualify for
 20  4 the tax credit.
 20  5    The tax credit shall be claimed for the tax year during
 20  6 which the eligible business was issued the tax credit.  The tax
 20  7 credit may be claimed against the individual income tax and the
 20  8 corporate income tax.  The credit is refundable or may, at the
 20  9 election of the taxpayer, be carried forward for up to one tax
 20 10 year.   The tax credit shall not be transferred to any person.  A
 20 11 tax credit issued to a partnership, limited liability company,
 20 12 S corporation, cooperative organized under Code chapter 501
 20 13 and filing as a partnership for federal tax purposes, estate,
 20 14 or trust electing to have the income taxed directly to the
 20 15 individual may be claimed by the individual based upon the pro
 20 16 rata share of the individual's earnings from that entity.
 20 17    The division provides that the program is subject to the
 20 18 EDA's maximum aggregate tax credit cap of $170 million per
 20 19 fiscal year in Code section 15.119, and not more than $15
 20 20 million per fiscal year may be issued by the EDA under the
 20 21 program.  In addition, the maximum amount of tax credit that
 20 22 may be issued to an eligible business in any one calendar year
 20 23 shall not exceed $1 million or $500,000, depending on whether
 20 24 the eligible business has been operating in Iowa at the time of
 20 25 application for five or fewer years, or more than five years,
 20 26 respectively.  An eligible business shall not receive more than
 20 27 five tax credits under the program.  The EDA is required to
 20 28 issue tax credits on a first=come, first=served basis until the
 20 29 maximum amount of $15 million per fiscal year is reached.  If
 20 30 the amount of tax credits exceeds this amount in a fiscal year,
 20 31 the EDA is required to establish a wait list and give priority
 20 32 in subsequent years to the eligible businesses on the wait
 20 33 list.
 20 34    The division provides for the confidentiality of certain
 20 35 information under the program.  The identity of a tax credit
 21  1 recipient and the amount of the tax credit shall be considered
 21  2 public information under Code chapter 22 (examination of public
 21  3 records), but any other information or record in the possession
 21  4 of the EDA with respect to the program shall be presumed by
 21  5 the EDA to be a trade secret protected under Code chapter 550
 21  6 or common law and shall be kept confidential by the EDA unless
 21  7 otherwise ordered by a court.
 21  8    The division takes effect upon enactment and applies to
 21  9 renewable chemicals produced in Iowa from biomass feedstock on
 21 10 or after that date.  The division applies retroactively to tax
 21 11 years beginning on or after January 1, 2015.
 21 12    DIVISION II ==== ANGEL INVESTOR TAX CREDITS.   Division II
 21 13 makes several changes to the tax credit for investments in
 21 14 qualifying businesses and community=based seed capital funds,
 21 15 often referred to as the angel investor tax credits.  The
 21 16 division amends the purpose of the tax credit in Code section
 21 17 15E.41.  The division excludes investments in community=based
 21 18 seed capital funds from qualifying for the tax credit and
 21 19 makes several conforming amendments to remove references to
 21 20 community=based seed capital funds from the Code.
 21 21    The division modifies the amount and dollar limitation of
 21 22 the tax credit for a taxpayer.  The tax credit is increased
 21 23 from 20 percent to 25 percent of a taxpayer's equity investment
 21 24 in a qualifying business.  Under current law, a taxpayer cannot
 21 25 claim more than $50,000 of tax credit per investment in a
 21 26 qualifying business, and for each tax year a taxpayer and the
 21 27 taxpayer's affiliates cannot claim tax credits for more than
 21 28 five investments in five different qualifying businesses.  The
 21 29 division amends this dollar limitation to prohibit a natural
 21 30 person and the person's spouse, child, or sibling from claiming
 21 31 a combined amount of more than $100,000 in tax credits per tax
 21 32 year.
 21 33    The division also provides that no more than $500,000 in tax
 21 34 credits may be issued per tax year for equity investments in
 21 35 any one qualifying business.
 22  1 The division modifies the procedures for claiming the tax
 22  2 credit.  Under current law, the tax credit is not refundable
 22  3 but available for carryforward for up to five tax years.  The
 22  4 division makes the tax credit refundable for an investment
 22  5 made by a natural person, and for any other person reduces the
 22  6 carryforward period to three years.
 22  7    The division strikes a provision permitting the EDA
 22  8 to cooperate with small business development centers to
 22  9 disseminate information regarding the credits and to develop
 22 10 standard application forms, and requiring the EDA to distribute
 22 11 copies of the application forms to all community=based seed
 22 12 capital funds and potential individual investors.
 22 13    The division modifies the eligibility requirements for
 22 14 qualifying businesses.  The division strikes the requirement
 22 15 that a business have an owner that meets at least one of
 22 16 four qualifications relating to business education or
 22 17 business experience.  The division requires that a business
 22 18 be participating in an entrepreneurial assistance program,
 22 19 as defined in the division, but allows the EDA to waive this
 22 20 requirement if the business establishes that its owners,
 22 21 directors, officers, and employees have an appropriate level
 22 22 of experience such that an entrepreneurial assistance program
 22 23 would not materially change the prospects of the business.
 22 24 The EDA is allowed to consult with outside service providers
 22 25 in considering such a waiver.  The division increases from $5
 22 26 million to $10 million the maximum amount of net worth that
 22 27 a business may have to be considered a qualifying business.
 22 28 The division increases from $250,000 to $500,000 the amount of
 22 29 financing that a business must have in order to be considered a
 22 30 qualifying business, removes "near equity" from the types of
 22 31 financing that will be considered in that calculation, requires
 22 32 that the financing be secured at the time of application for
 22 33 the tax credits, and requires that the business have at least
 22 34 two investors at the time of application for the tax credits.
 22 35 These modified eligibility requirements apply to businesses
 23  1 that submit an application to the EDA to be registered as a
 23  2 qualifying business on or after the effective date of this
 23  3 division of the bill, and businesses that submitted such an
 23  4 application to the EDA before the effective date of this
 23  5 division of the bill shall be governed by current law.
 23  6    The division provides for the confidentiality of certain
 23  7 information with regard to the tax credit.  The identity of
 23  8 a qualifying business, the identity of an investor and the
 23  9 qualifying business in which the investor made an equity
 23 10 investment, and the total number and amount of tax credits
 23 11 issued shall be considered public information under Code
 23 12 chapter 22 (examination of public records), but any other
 23 13 information or record in the possession of the EDA with respect
 23 14 to the program shall be presumed by the EDA to be a trade secret
 23 15 protected under Code chapter 550 or common law and shall be
 23 16 kept confidential by the EDA unless otherwise ordered by a
 23 17 court.
 23 18    The division takes effect upon enactment and applies to
 23 19 equity investments in a qualifying business made on or after
 23 20 that date.  Equity investments in a qualifying business or
 23 21 community=based seed capital fund made prior to the effective
 23 22 date of the division shall be governed by current law.
 23 23    DIVISION III ==== ENTREPRENEUR INVESTMENT AWARDS PROGRAM.
 23 24  Division III amends the entrepreneur investment awards program
 23 25 administered by the EDA.  The division strikes provisions that
 23 26 prohibited the EDA from making awards under the program since
 23 27 July 1, 2014, and that required the EDA by December 31, 2014,
 23 28 to conduct a comprehensive review of the program and submit
 23 29 a report with specified information to the governor and the
 23 30 general assembly.
 23 31    The division modifies the purpose of the program to be
 23 32 to provide financial assistance to eligible entrepreneurial
 23 33 assistance providers (provider) that provide technical and
 23 34 financial assistance to entrepreneurs and start=up companies
 23 35 seeking to create, locate, or expand a business in Iowa.
 24  1 "Financial assistance" is defined in the division.
 24  2    The division changes the requirements for receiving an
 24  3 award.  To be eligible to receive an award under current
 24  4 law, an entrepreneurial assistance program must have been
 24  5 an Iowa=based business, expended at least $500,000 during
 24  6 the previous fiscal year to provide technical and financial
 24  7 assistance services that meet the broad=based needs of
 24  8 entrepreneurs seeking to create, locate, or expand a business
 24  9 in Iowa that intends to derive more than 10 percent of its
 24 10 gross sales from markets outside Iowa; and must have engaged
 24 11 and communicated with certain other programs, funding sources,
 24 12 and entities for its entrepreneur clients.  The division
 24 13 amends the eligibility for receiving financial assistance to
 24 14 require that a provider have its principal place of operations
 24 15 in Iowa and that the provider offer a comprehensive set of
 24 16 business development services to emerging and early=stage
 24 17 innovation companies to assist in the creation, location,
 24 18 growth, and long=term success of the company in Iowa.
 24 19 "Business development services" is defined in the division.
 24 20 Business development services may be performed at the physical
 24 21 location of the provider or the company and may be provided in
 24 22 consideration of equity participation in the company, a fee for
 24 23 services, or a membership agreement with the company.
 24 24    Under current law, the EDA board could approve, deny, or
 24 25 defer each application for a grant, and was required to award
 24 26 grants on a first=come, first=served basis.  The division
 24 27 specifies that the EDA board has the discretion to approve,
 24 28 deny, or defer each application for financial assistance and
 24 29 that the amount of financial assistance awarded to a provider
 24 30 is within the discretion of the EDA.  The division requires
 24 31 the EDA to award financial assistance on a competitive basis
 24 32 and allows the EDA to develop scoring criteria and establish
 24 33 minimum requirements for the receipt of a financial assistance
 24 34 award.
 24 35    In addition to the four factors relating to the provider's
 25  1 professional staff that the EDA may consider under current
 25  2 law in deciding whether to award financial assistance, the
 25  3 division provides that the EDA may also consider the service
 25  4 model and likelihood of success of the provider, the provider's
 25  5 similarity to other successful providers in the country, and
 25  6 the provider's financial need.
 25  7    The division modifies the maximum award amount for a
 25  8 recipient.  Under current law, a grant to an entrepreneur
 25  9 assistance program cannot exceed the lesser of 25 percent of
 25 10 the funds expended by the program during the previous fiscal
 25 11 year, 100 percent of the funds raised from certain persons
 25 12 by the program during the previous fiscal year, or $200,000.
 25 13 The division provides that the amount of financial assistance
 25 14 awarded to any one provider shall not exceed $200,000.
 25 15    The division modifies the permitted use of funds received
 25 16 under the program.  Under current law, grants are only
 25 17 permitted to be used for the purpose of operating costs
 25 18 incurred by the program.  The division specifies that financial
 25 19 assistance awarded to a provider shall only be used for
 25 20 the purpose of operating costs incurred by the provider in
 25 21 the provision of business development services to emerging
 25 22 and early=stage innovation companies in Iowa.  The division
 25 23 further requires that such financial assistance shall not be
 25 24 distributed to owners or investors of the company to which the
 25 25 business development services are being provided and shall not
 25 26 be provided to other persons assisting with the provision of
 25 27 the services.
 25 28    Under current law, an entrepreneurial assistance provider is
 25 29 required to accept client referrals from the EDA as a condition
 25 30 of receiving a grant.  The division provides that the EDA may
 25 31 make client referrals to eligible providers.
 25 32    DIVISION IV ==== MISCELLANEOUS CHANGES.  Division IV makes
 25 33 several miscellaneous changes to other EDA programs.  The
 25 34 division amends the sales and use tax refund available under
 25 35 the workforce housing tax incentive program.  That refund
 26  1 is available for sales and use tax paid prior to project
 26  2 completion, which is currently defined to mean the first date
 26  3 upon which the average annualized production of finished
 26  4 product for the preceding 90=day period at the manufacturing
 26  5 facility operated by the eligible business is at least 50
 26  6 percent of the initial design capacity of the facility.  The
 26  7 division amends the definition of "project completion" to mean
 26  8 the date on which the EDA notifies the department of revenue
 26  9 that all applicable requirements of a workforce housing tax
 26 10 incentive program agreement are satisfied.  This provision
 26 11 takes effect upon enactment and applies retroactively to July
 26 12 1, 2014, for all workforce housing tax incentive agreements
 26 13 entered into on or after that date.
 26 14    The division allows the EDA to extend the project
 26 15 completion date for a project awarded tax incentives under the
 26 16 redevelopment tax credit program and the housing enterprise
 26 17 zone tax incentives program if the property that is the subject
 26 18 of the project suffered a catastrophic fire during the 2014
 26 19 calendar year.
       LSB 1212HV (3) 86
       mm/sc
 19 27 rescinded, and may be subject to the repayment or recapture of
 19 28 claimed tax credits.
 19 29    Upon determining that all requirements of an agreement and
 19 30 the program have been fulfilled, the EDA shall issue a tax
 19 31 credit and related tax credit certificate to the eligible
 19 32 business in an amount equal to the product of $.05 multiplied
 19 33 by the number of pounds of renewable chemicals produced in Iowa
 19 34 from biomass feedstock by the eligible business during the
 19 35 calendar year.  Renewable chemicals produced by an eligible
 20  1 business prior to the effective date of the division, or
 20  2 prior to the date the business first qualifies as an eligible
 20  3 business, or after calendar year 2025, shall not qualify for
 20  4 the tax credit.
 20  5    The tax credit shall be claimed for the tax year during
 20  6 which the eligible business was issued the tax credit.  The tax
 20  7 credit may be claimed against the individual income tax and the
 20  8 corporate income tax.  The credit is refundable or may, at the
 20  9 election of the taxpayer, be carried forward for up to one tax
 20 10 year.   The tax credit shall not be transferred to any person.  A
 20 11 tax credit issued to a partnership, limited liability company,
 20 12 S corporation, cooperative organized under Code chapter 501
 20 13 and filing as a partnership for federal tax purposes, estate,
 20 14 or trust electing to have the income taxed directly to the
 20 15 individual may be claimed by the individual based upon the pro
 20 16 rata share of the individual's earnings from that entity.
 20 17    The division provides that the program is subject to the
 20 18 EDA's maximum aggregate tax credit cap of $170 million per
 20 19 fiscal year in Code section 15.119, and not more than $15
 20 20 million per fiscal year may be issued by the EDA under the
 20 21 program.  In addition, the maximum amount of tax credit that
 20 22 may be issued to an eligible business in any one calendar year
 20 23 shall not exceed $1 million or $500,000, depending on whether
 20 24 the eligible business has been operating in Iowa at the time of
 20 25 application for five or fewer years, or more than five years,
 20 26 respectively.  An eligible business shall not receive more than
 20 27 five tax credits under the program.  The EDA is required to
 20 28 issue tax credits on a first=come, first=served basis until the
 20 29 maximum amount of $15 million per fiscal year is reached.  If
 20 30 the amount of tax credits exceeds this amount in a fiscal year,
 20 31 the EDA is required to establish a wait list and give priority
 20 32 in subsequent years to the eligible businesses on the wait
 20 33 list.
 20 34    The division provides for the confidentiality of certain
 20 35 information under the program.  The identity of a tax credit
 21  1 recipient and the amount of the tax credit shall be considered
 21  2 public information under Code chapter 22 (examination of public
 21  3 records), but any other information or record in the possession
 21  4 of the EDA with respect to the program shall be presumed by
 21  5 the EDA to be a trade secret protected under Code chapter 550
 21  6 or common law and shall be kept confidential by the EDA unless
 21  7 otherwise ordered by a court.
 21  8    The division takes effect upon enactment and applies to
 21  9 renewable chemicals produced in Iowa from biomass feedstock on
 21 10 or after that date.  The division applies retroactively to tax
 21 11 years beginning on or after January 1, 2015.
 21 12    DIVISION II ==== ANGEL INVESTOR TAX CREDITS.   Division II
 21 13 makes several changes to the tax credit for investments in
 21 14 qualifying businesses and community=based seed capital funds,
 21 15 often referred to as the angel investor tax credits.  The
 21 16 division amends the purpose of the tax credit in Code section
 21 17 15E.41.  The division excludes investments in community=based
 21 18 seed capital funds from qualifying for the tax credit and
 21 19 makes several conforming amendments to remove references to
 21 20 community=based seed capital funds from the Code.
 21 21    The division modifies the amount and dollar limitation of
 21 22 the tax credit for a taxpayer.  The tax credit is increased
 21 23 from 20 percent to 25 percent of a taxpayer's equity investment
 21 24 in a qualifying business.  Under current law, a taxpayer cannot
 21 25 claim more than $50,000 of tax credit per investment in a
 21 26 qualifying business, and for each tax year a taxpayer and the
 21 27 taxpayer's affiliates cannot claim tax credits for more than
 21 28 five investments in five different qualifying businesses.  The
 21 29 division amends this dollar limitation to prohibit a natural
 21 30 person and the person's spouse, child, or sibling from claiming
 21 31 a combined amount of more than $100,000 in tax credits per tax
 21 32 year.
 21 33    The division also provides that no more than $500,000 in tax
 21 34 credits may be issued per tax year for equity investments in
 21 35 any one qualifying business.
 22  1 The division modifies the procedures for claiming the tax
 22  2 credit.  Under current law, the tax credit is not refundable
 22  3 but available for carryforward for up to five tax years.  The
 22  4 division makes the tax credit refundable for an investment
 22  5 made by a natural person, and for any other person reduces the
 22  6 carryforward period to three years.
 22  7    The division strikes a provision permitting the EDA
 22  8 to cooperate with small business development centers to
 22  9 disseminate information regarding the credits and to develop
 22 10 standard application forms, and requiring the EDA to distribute
 22 11 copies of the application forms to all community=based seed
 22 12 capital funds and potential individual investors.
 22 13    The division modifies the eligibility requirements for
 22 14 qualifying businesses.  The division strikes the requirement
 22 15 that a business have an owner that meets at least one of
 22 16 four qualifications relating to business education or
 22 17 business experience.  The division requires that a business
 22 18 be participating in an entrepreneurial assistance program,
 22 19 as defined in the division, but allows the EDA to waive this
 22 20 requirement if the business establishes that its owners,
 22 21 directors, officers, and employees have an appropriate level
 22 22 of experience such that an entrepreneurial assistance program
 22 23 would not materially change the prospects of the business.
 22 24 The EDA is allowed to consult with outside service providers
 22 25 in considering such a waiver.  The division increases from $5
 22 26 million to $10 million the maximum amount of net worth that
 22 27 a business may have to be considered a qualifying business.
 22 28 The division increases from $250,000 to $500,000 the amount of
 22 29 financing that a business must have in order to be considered a
 22 30 qualifying business, removes "near equity" from the types of
 22 31 financing that will be considered in that calculation, requires
 22 32 that the financing be secured at the time of application for
 22 33 the tax credits, and requires that the business have at least
 22 34 two investors at the time of application for the tax credits.
 22 35 These modified eligibility requirements apply to businesses
 23  1 that submit an application to the EDA to be registered as a
 23  2 qualifying business on or after the effective date of this
 23  3 division of the bill, and businesses that submitted such an
 23  4 application to the EDA before the effective date of this
 23  5 division of the bill shall be governed by current law.
 23  6    The division provides for the confidentiality of certain
 23  7 information with regard to the tax credit.  The identity of
 23  8 a qualifying business, the identity of an investor and the
 23  9 qualifying business in which the investor made an equity
 23 10 investment, and the total number and amount of tax credits
 23 11 issued shall be considered public information under Code
 23 12 chapter 22 (examination of public records), but any other
 23 13 information or record in the possession of the EDA with respect
 23 14 to the program shall be presumed by the EDA to be a trade secret
 23 15 protected under Code chapter 550 or common law and shall be
 23 16 kept confidential by the EDA unless otherwise ordered by a
 23 17 court.
 23 18    The division takes effect upon enactment and applies to
 23 19 equity investments in a qualifying business made on or after
 23 20 that date.  Equity investments in a qualifying business or
 23 21 community=based seed capital fund made prior to the effective
 23 22 date of the division shall be governed by current law.
 23 23    DIVISION III ==== ENTREPRENEUR INVESTMENT AWARDS PROGRAM.
 23 24  Division III amends the entrepreneur investment awards program
 23 25 administered by the EDA.  The division strikes provisions that
 23 26 prohibited the EDA from making awards under the program since
 23 27 July 1, 2014, and that required the EDA by December 31, 2014,
 23 28 to conduct a comprehensive review of the program and submit
 23 29 a report with specified information to the governor and the
 23 30 general assembly.
 23 31    The division modifies the purpose of the program to be
 23 32 to provide financial assistance to eligible entrepreneurial
 23 33 assistance providers (provider) that provide technical and
 23 34 financial assistance to entrepreneurs and start=up companies
 23 35 seeking to create, locate, or expand a business in Iowa.
 24  1 "Financial assistance" is defined in the division.
 24  2    The division changes the requirements for receiving an
 24  3 award.  To be eligible to receive an award under current
 24  4 law, an entrepreneurial assistance program must have been
 24  5 an Iowa=based business, expended at least $500,000 during
 24  6 the previous fiscal year to provide technical and financial
 24  7 assistance services that meet the broad=based needs of
 24  8 entrepreneurs seeking to create, locate, or expand a business
 24  9 in Iowa that intends to derive more than 10 percent of its
 24 10 gross sales from markets outside Iowa; and must have engaged
 24 11 and communicated with certain other programs, funding sources,
 24 12 and entities for its entrepreneur clients.  The division
 24 13 amends the eligibility for receiving financial assistance to
 24 14 require that a provider have its principal place of operations
 24 15 in Iowa and that the provider offer a comprehensive set of
 24 16 business development services to emerging and early=stage
 24 17 innovation companies to assist in the creation, location,
 24 18 growth, and long=term success of the company in Iowa.
 24 19 "Business development services" is defined in the division.
 24 20 Business development services may be performed at the physical
 24 21 location of the provider or the company and may be provided in
 24 22 consideration of equity participation in the company, a fee for
 24 23 services, or a membership agreement with the company.
 24 24    Under current law, the EDA board could approve, deny, or
 24 25 defer each application for a grant, and was required to award
 24 26 grants on a first=come, first=served basis.  The division
 24 27 specifies that the EDA board has the discretion to approve,
 24 28 deny, or defer each application for financial assistance and
 24 29 that the amount of financial assistance awarded to a provider
 24 30 is within the discretion of the EDA.  The division requires
 24 31 the EDA to award financial assistance on a competitive basis
 24 32 and allows the EDA to develop scoring criteria and establish
 24 33 minimum requirements for the receipt of a financial assistance
 24 34 award.
 24 35    In addition to the four factors relating to the provider's
 25  1 professional staff that the EDA may consider under current
 25  2 law in deciding whether to award financial assistance, the
 25  3 division provides that the EDA may also consider the service
 25  4 model and likelihood of success of the provider, the provider's
 25  5 similarity to other successful providers in the country, and
 25  6 the provider's financial need.
 25  7    The division modifies the maximum award amount for a
 25  8 recipient.  Under current law, a grant to an entrepreneur
 25  9 assistance program cannot exceed the lesser of 25 percent of
 25 10 the funds expended by the program during the previous fiscal
 25 11 year, 100 percent of the funds raised from certain persons
 25 12 by the program during the previous fiscal year, or $200,000.
 25 13 The division provides that the amount of financial assistance
 25 14 awarded to any one provider shall not exceed $200,000.
 25 15    The division modifies the permitted use of funds received
 25 16 under the program.  Under current law, grants are only
 25 17 permitted to be used for the purpose of operating costs
 25 18 incurred by the program.  The division specifies that financial
 25 19 assistance awarded to a provider shall only be used for
 25 20 the purpose of operating costs incurred by the provider in
 25 21 the provision of business development services to emerging
 25 22 and early=stage innovation companies in Iowa.  The division
 25 23 further requires that such financial assistance shall not be
 25 24 distributed to owners or investors of the company to which the
 25 25 business development services are being provided and shall not
 25 26 be provided to other persons assisting with the provision of
 25 27 the services.
 25 28    Under current law, an entrepreneurial assistance provider is
 25 29 required to accept client referrals from the EDA as a condition
 25 30 of receiving a grant.  The division provides that the EDA may
 25 31 make client referrals to eligible providers.
 25 32    DIVISION IV ==== MISCELLANEOUS CHANGES.  Division IV makes
 25 33 several miscellaneous changes to other EDA programs.  The
 25 34 division amends the sales and use tax refund available under
 25 35 the workforce housing tax incentive program.  That refund
 26  1 is available for sales and use tax paid prior to project
 26  2 completion, which is currently defined to mean the first date
 26  3 upon which the average annualized production of finished
 26  4 product for the preceding 90=day period at the manufacturing
 26  5 facility operated by the eligible business is at least 50
 26  6 percent of the initial design capacity of the facility.  The
 26  7 division amends the definition of "project completion" to mean
 26  8 the date on which the EDA notifies the department of revenue
 26  9 that all applicable requirements of a workforce housing tax
 26 10 incentive program agreement are satisfied.  This provision
 26 11 takes effect upon enactment and applies retroactively to July
 26 12 1, 2014, for all workforce housing tax incentive agreements
 26 13 entered into on or after that date.
 26 14    The division allows the EDA to extend the project
 26 15 completion date for a project awarded tax incentives under the
 26 16 redevelopment tax credit program and the housing enterprise
 26 17 zone tax incentives program if the property that is the subject
 26 18 of the project suffered a catastrophic fire during the 2014
 26 19 calendar year.
       LSB 1212HV (3) 86
       mm/sc
 19 28 claimed tax credits.
 19 29    Upon determining that all requirements of an agreement and
 19 30 the program have been fulfilled, the EDA shall issue a tax
 19 31 credit and related tax credit certificate to the eligible
 19 32 business in an amount equal to the product of $.05 multiplied
 19 33 by the number of pounds of renewable chemicals produced in Iowa
 19 34 from biomass feedstock by the eligible business during the
 19 35 calendar year.  Renewable chemicals produced by an eligible
 20  1 business prior to the effective date of the division, or
 20  2 prior to the date the business first qualifies as an eligible
 20  3 business, or after calendar year 2025, shall not qualify for
 20  4 the tax credit.
 20  5    The tax credit shall be claimed for the tax year during
 20  6 which the eligible business was issued the tax credit.  The tax
 20  7 credit may be claimed against the individual income tax and the
 20  8 corporate income tax.  The credit is refundable or may, at the
 20  9 election of the taxpayer, be carried forward for up to one tax
 20 10 year.   The tax credit shall not be transferred to any person.  A
 20 11 tax credit issued to a partnership, limited liability company,
 20 12 S corporation, cooperative organized under Code chapter 501
 20 13 and filing as a partnership for federal tax purposes, estate,
 20 14 or trust electing to have the income taxed directly to the
 20 15 individual may be claimed by the individual based upon the pro
 20 16 rata share of the individual's earnings from that entity.
 20 17    The division provides that the program is subject to the
 20 18 EDA's maximum aggregate tax credit cap of $170 million per
 20 19 fiscal year in Code section 15.119, and not more than $15
 20 20 million per fiscal year may be issued by the EDA under the
 20 21 program.  In addition, the maximum amount of tax credit that
 20 22 may be issued to an eligible business in any one calendar year
 20 23 shall not exceed $1 million or $500,000, depending on whether
 20 24 the eligible business has been operating in Iowa at the time of
 20 25 application for five or fewer years, or more than five years,
 20 26 respectively.  An eligible business shall not receive more than
 20 27 five tax credits under the program.  The EDA is required to
 20 28 issue tax credits on a first=come, first=served basis until the
 20 29 maximum amount of $15 million per fiscal year is reached.  If
 20 30 the amount of tax credits exceeds this amount in a fiscal year,
 20 31 the EDA is required to establish a wait list and give priority
 20 32 in subsequent years to the eligible businesses on the wait
 20 33 list.
 20 34    The division provides for the confidentiality of certain
 20 35 information under the program.  The identity of a tax credit
 21  1 recipient and the amount of the tax credit shall be considered
 21  2 public information under Code chapter 22 (examination of public
 21  3 records), but any other information or record in the possession
 21  4 of the EDA with respect to the program shall be presumed by
 21  5 the EDA to be a trade secret protected under Code chapter 550
 21  6 or common law and shall be kept confidential by the EDA unless
 21  7 otherwise ordered by a court.
 21  8    The division takes effect upon enactment and applies to
 21  9 renewable chemicals produced in Iowa from biomass feedstock on
 21 10 or after that date.  The division applies retroactively to tax
 21 11 years beginning on or after January 1, 2015.
 21 12    DIVISION II ==== ANGEL INVESTOR TAX CREDITS.   Division II
 21 13 makes several changes to the tax credit for investments in
 21 14 qualifying businesses and community=based seed capital funds,
 21 15 often referred to as the angel investor tax credits.  The
 21 16 division amends the purpose of the tax credit in Code section
 21 17 15E.41.  The division excludes investments in community=based
 21 18 seed capital funds from qualifying for the tax credit and
 21 19 makes several conforming amendments to remove references to
 21 20 community=based seed capital funds from the Code.
 21 21    The division modifies the amount and dollar limitation of
 21 22 the tax credit for a taxpayer.  The tax credit is increased
 21 23 from 20 percent to 25 percent of a taxpayer's equity investment
 21 24 in a qualifying business.  Under current law, a taxpayer cannot
 21 25 claim more than $50,000 of tax credit per investment in a
 21 26 qualifying business, and for each tax year a taxpayer and the
 21 27 taxpayer's affiliates cannot claim tax credits for more than
 21 28 five investments in five different qualifying businesses.  The
 21 29 division amends this dollar limitation to prohibit a natural
 21 30 person and the person's spouse, child, or sibling from claiming
 21 31 a combined amount of more than $100,000 in tax credits per tax
 21 32 year.
 21 33    The division also provides that no more than $500,000 in tax
 21 34 credits may be issued per tax year for equity investments in
 21 35 any one qualifying business.
 22  1 The division modifies the procedures for claiming the tax
 22  2 credit.  Under current law, the tax credit is not refundable
 22  3 but available for carryforward for up to five tax years.  The
 22  4 division makes the tax credit refundable for an investment
 22  5 made by a natural person, and for any other person reduces the
 22  6 carryforward period to three years.
 22  7    The division strikes a provision permitting the EDA
 22  8 to cooperate with small business development centers to
 22  9 disseminate information regarding the credits and to develop
 22 10 standard application forms, and requiring the EDA to distribute
 22 11 copies of the application forms to all community=based seed
 22 12 capital funds and potential individual investors.
 22 13    The division modifies the eligibility requirements for
 22 14 qualifying businesses.  The division strikes the requirement
 22 15 that a business have an owner that meets at least one of
 22 16 four qualifications relating to business education or
 22 17 business experience.  The division requires that a business
 22 18 be participating in an entrepreneurial assistance program,
 22 19 as defined in the division, but allows the EDA to waive this
 22 20 requirement if the business establishes that its owners,
 22 21 directors, officers, and employees have an appropriate level
 22 22 of experience such that an entrepreneurial assistance program
 22 23 would not materially change the prospects of the business.
 22 24 The EDA is allowed to consult with outside service providers
 22 25 in considering such a waiver.  The division increases from $5
 22 26 million to $10 million the maximum amount of net worth that
 22 27 a business may have to be considered a qualifying business.
 22 28 The division increases from $250,000 to $500,000 the amount of
 22 29 financing that a business must have in order to be considered a
 22 30 qualifying business, removes "near equity" from the types of
 22 31 financing that will be considered in that calculation, requires
 22 32 that the financing be secured at the time of application for
 22 33 the tax credits, and requires that the business have at least
 22 34 two investors at the time of application for the tax credits.
 22 35 These modified eligibility requirements apply to businesses
 23  1 that submit an application to the EDA to be registered as a
 23  2 qualifying business on or after the effective date of this
 23  3 division of the bill, and businesses that submitted such an
 23  4 application to the EDA before the effective date of this
 23  5 division of the bill shall be governed by current law.
 23  6    The division provides for the confidentiality of certain
 23  7 information with regard to the tax credit.  The identity of
 23  8 a qualifying business, the identity of an investor and the
 23  9 qualifying business in which the investor made an equity
 23 10 investment, and the total number and amount of tax credits
 23 11 issued shall be considered public information under Code
 23 12 chapter 22 (examination of public records), but any other
 23 13 information or record in the possession of the EDA with respect
 23 14 to the program shall be presumed by the EDA to be a trade secret
 23 15 protected under Code chapter 550 or common law and shall be
 23 16 kept confidential by the EDA unless otherwise ordered by a
 23 17 court.
 23 18    The division takes effect upon enactment and applies to
 23 19 equity investments in a qualifying business made on or after
 23 20 that date.  Equity investments in a qualifying business or
 23 21 community=based seed capital fund made prior to the effective
 23 22 date of the division shall be governed by current law.
 23 23    DIVISION III ==== ENTREPRENEUR INVESTMENT AWARDS PROGRAM.
 23 24  Division III amends the entrepreneur investment awards program
 23 25 administered by the EDA.  The division strikes provisions that
 23 26 prohibited the EDA from making awards under the program since
 23 27 July 1, 2014, and that required the EDA by December 31, 2014,
 23 28 to conduct a comprehensive review of the program and submit
 23 29 a report with specified information to the governor and the
 23 30 general assembly.
 23 31    The division modifies the purpose of the program to be
 23 32 to provide financial assistance to eligible entrepreneurial
 23 33 assistance providers (provider) that provide technical and
 23 34 financial assistance to entrepreneurs and start=up companies
 23 35 seeking to create, locate, or expand a business in Iowa.
 24  1 "Financial assistance" is defined in the division.
 24  2    The division changes the requirements for receiving an
 24  3 award.  To be eligible to receive an award under current
 24  4 law, an entrepreneurial assistance program must have been
 24  5 an Iowa=based business, expended at least $500,000 during
 24  6 the previous fiscal year to provide technical and financial
 24  7 assistance services that meet the broad=based needs of
 24  8 entrepreneurs seeking to create, locate, or expand a business
 24  9 in Iowa that intends to derive more than 10 percent of its
 24 10 gross sales from markets outside Iowa; and must have engaged
 24 11 and communicated with certain other programs, funding sources,
 24 12 and entities for its entrepreneur clients.  The division
 24 13 amends the eligibility for receiving financial assistance to
 24 14 require that a provider have its principal place of operations
 24 15 in Iowa and that the provider offer a comprehensive set of
 24 16 business development services to emerging and early=stage
 24 17 innovation companies to assist in the creation, location,
 24 18 growth, and long=term success of the company in Iowa.
 24 19 "Business development services" is defined in the division.
 24 20 Business development services may be performed at the physical
 24 21 location of the provider or the company and may be provided in
 24 22 consideration of equity participation in the company, a fee for
 24 23 services, or a membership agreement with the company.
 24 24    Under current law, the EDA board could approve, deny, or
 24 25 defer each application for a grant, and was required to award
 24 26 grants on a first=come, first=served basis.  The division
 24 27 specifies that the EDA board has the discretion to approve,
 24 28 deny, or defer each application for financial assistance and
 24 29 that the amount of financial assistance awarded to a provider
 24 30 is within the discretion of the EDA.  The division requires
 24 31 the EDA to award financial assistance on a competitive basis
 24 32 and allows the EDA to develop scoring criteria and establish
 24 33 minimum requirements for the receipt of a financial assistance
 24 34 award.
 24 35    In addition to the four factors relating to the provider's
 25  1 professional staff that the EDA may consider under current
 25  2 law in deciding whether to award financial assistance, the
 25  3 division provides that the EDA may also consider the service
 25  4 model and likelihood of success of the provider, the provider's
 25  5 similarity to other successful providers in the country, and
 25  6 the provider's financial need.
 25  7    The division modifies the maximum award amount for a
 25  8 recipient.  Under current law, a grant to an entrepreneur
 25  9 assistance program cannot exceed the lesser of 25 percent of
 25 10 the funds expended by the program during the previous fiscal
 25 11 year, 100 percent of the funds raised from certain persons
 25 12 by the program during the previous fiscal year, or $200,000.
 25 13 The division provides that the amount of financial assistance
 25 14 awarded to any one provider shall not exceed $200,000.
 25 15    The division modifies the permitted use of funds received
 25 16 under the program.  Under current law, grants are only
 25 17 permitted to be used for the purpose of operating costs
 25 18 incurred by the program.  The division specifies that financial
 25 19 assistance awarded to a provider shall only be used for
 25 20 the purpose of operating costs incurred by the provider in
 25 21 the provision of business development services to emerging
 25 22 and early=stage innovation companies in Iowa.  The division
 25 23 further requires that such financial assistance shall not be
 25 24 distributed to owners or investors of the company to which the
 25 25 business development services are being provided and shall not
 25 26 be provided to other persons assisting with the provision of
 25 27 the services.
 25 28    Under current law, an entrepreneurial assistance provider is
 25 29 required to accept client referrals from the EDA as a condition
 25 30 of receiving a grant.  The division provides that the EDA may
 25 31 make client referrals to eligible providers.
 25 32    DIVISION IV ==== MISCELLANEOUS CHANGES.  Division IV makes
 25 33 several miscellaneous changes to other EDA programs.  The
 25 34 division amends the sales and use tax refund available under
 25 35 the workforce housing tax incentive program.  That refund
 26  1 is available for sales and use tax paid prior to project
 26  2 completion, which is currently defined to mean the first date
 26  3 upon which the average annualized production of finished
 26  4 product for the preceding 90=day period at the manufacturing
 26  5 facility operated by the eligible business is at least 50
 26  6 percent of the initial design capacity of the facility.  The
 26  7 division amends the definition of "project completion" to mean
 26  8 the date on which the EDA notifies the department of revenue
 26  9 that all applicable requirements of a workforce housing tax
 26 10 incentive program agreement are satisfied.  This provision
 26 11 takes effect upon enactment and applies retroactively to July
 26 12 1, 2014, for all workforce housing tax incentive agreements
 26 13 entered into on or after that date.
 26 14    The division allows the EDA to extend the project
 26 15 completion date for a project awarded tax incentives under the
 26 16 redevelopment tax credit program and the housing enterprise
 26 17 zone tax incentives program if the property that is the subject
 26 18 of the project suffered a catastrophic fire during the 2014
 26 19 calendar year.
       LSB 1212HV (3) 86
       mm/sc
 19 29    Upon determining that all requirements of an agreement and
 19 30 the program have been fulfilled, the EDA shall issue a tax
 19 31 credit and related tax credit certificate to the eligible
 19 32 business in an amount equal to the product of $.05 multiplied
 19 33 by the number of pounds of renewable chemicals produced in Iowa
 19 34 from biomass feedstock by the eligible business during the
 19 35 calendar year.  Renewable chemicals produced by an eligible
 20  1 business prior to the effective date of the division, or
 20  2 prior to the date the business first qualifies as an eligible
 20  3 business, or after calendar year 2025, shall not qualify for
 20  4 the tax credit.
 20  5    The tax credit shall be claimed for the tax year during
 20  6 which the eligible business was issued the tax credit.  The tax
 20  7 credit may be claimed against the individual income tax and the
 20  8 corporate income tax.  The credit is refundable or may, at the
 20  9 election of the taxpayer, be carried forward for up to one tax
 20 10 year.   The tax credit shall not be transferred to any person.  A
 20 11 tax credit issued to a partnership, limited liability company,
 20 12 S corporation, cooperative organized under Code chapter 501
 20 13 and filing as a partnership for federal tax purposes, estate,
 20 14 or trust electing to have the income taxed directly to the
 20 15 individual may be claimed by the individual based upon the pro
 20 16 rata share of the individual's earnings from that entity.
 20 17    The division provides that the program is subject to the
 20 18 EDA's maximum aggregate tax credit cap of $170 million per
 20 19 fiscal year in Code section 15.119, and not more than $15
 20 20 million per fiscal year may be issued by the EDA under the
 20 21 program.  In addition, the maximum amount of tax credit that
 20 22 may be issued to an eligible business in any one calendar year
 20 23 shall not exceed $1 million or $500,000, depending on whether
 20 24 the eligible business has been operating in Iowa at the time of
 20 25 application for five or fewer years, or more than five years,
 20 26 respectively.  An eligible business shall not receive more than
 20 27 five tax credits under the program.  The EDA is required to
 20 28 issue tax credits on a first=come, first=served basis until the
 20 29 maximum amount of $15 million per fiscal year is reached.  If
 20 30 the amount of tax credits exceeds this amount in a fiscal year,
 20 31 the EDA is required to establish a wait list and give priority
 20 32 in subsequent years to the eligible businesses on the wait
 20 33 list.
 20 34    The division provides for the confidentiality of certain
 20 35 information under the program.  The identity of a tax credit
 21  1 recipient and the amount of the tax credit shall be considered
 21  2 public information under Code chapter 22 (examination of public
 21  3 records), but any other information or record in the possession
 21  4 of the EDA with respect to the program shall be presumed by
 21  5 the EDA to be a trade secret protected under Code chapter 550
 21  6 or common law and shall be kept confidential by the EDA unless
 21  7 otherwise ordered by a court.
 21  8    The division takes effect upon enactment and applies to
 21  9 renewable chemicals produced in Iowa from biomass feedstock on
 21 10 or after that date.  The division applies retroactively to tax
 21 11 years beginning on or after January 1, 2015.
 21 12    DIVISION II ==== ANGEL INVESTOR TAX CREDITS.   Division II
 21 13 makes several changes to the tax credit for investments in
 21 14 qualifying businesses and community=based seed capital funds,
 21 15 often referred to as the angel investor tax credits.  The
 21 16 division amends the purpose of the tax credit in Code section
 21 17 15E.41.  The division excludes investments in community=based
 21 18 seed capital funds from qualifying for the tax credit and
 21 19 makes several conforming amendments to remove references to
 21 20 community=based seed capital funds from the Code.
 21 21    The division modifies the amount and dollar limitation of
 21 22 the tax credit for a taxpayer.  The tax credit is increased
 21 23 from 20 percent to 25 percent of a taxpayer's equity investment
 21 24 in a qualifying business.  Under current law, a taxpayer cannot
 21 25 claim more than $50,000 of tax credit per investment in a
 21 26 qualifying business, and for each tax year a taxpayer and the
 21 27 taxpayer's affiliates cannot claim tax credits for more than
 21 28 five investments in five different qualifying businesses.  The
 21 29 division amends this dollar limitation to prohibit a natural
 21 30 person and the person's spouse, child, or sibling from claiming
 21 31 a combined amount of more than $100,000 in tax credits per tax
 21 32 year.
 21 33    The division also provides that no more than $500,000 in tax
 21 34 credits may be issued per tax year for equity investments in
 21 35 any one qualifying business.
 22  1 The division modifies the procedures for claiming the tax
 22  2 credit.  Under current law, the tax credit is not refundable
 22  3 but available for carryforward for up to five tax years.  The
 22  4 division makes the tax credit refundable for an investment
 22  5 made by a natural person, and for any other person reduces the
 22  6 carryforward period to three years.
 22  7    The division strikes a provision permitting the EDA
 22  8 to cooperate with small business development centers to
 22  9 disseminate information regarding the credits and to develop
 22 10 standard application forms, and requiring the EDA to distribute
 22 11 copies of the application forms to all community=based seed
 22 12 capital funds and potential individual investors.
 22 13    The division modifies the eligibility requirements for
 22 14 qualifying businesses.  The division strikes the requirement
 22 15 that a business have an owner that meets at least one of
 22 16 four qualifications relating to business education or
 22 17 business experience.  The division requires that a business
 22 18 be participating in an entrepreneurial assistance program,
 22 19 as defined in the division, but allows the EDA to waive this
 22 20 requirement if the business establishes that its owners,
 22 21 directors, officers, and employees have an appropriate level
 22 22 of experience such that an entrepreneurial assistance program
 22 23 would not materially change the prospects of the business.
 22 24 The EDA is allowed to consult with outside service providers
 22 25 in considering such a waiver.  The division increases from $5
 22 26 million to $10 million the maximum amount of net worth that
 22 27 a business may have to be considered a qualifying business.
 22 28 The division increases from $250,000 to $500,000 the amount of
 22 29 financing that a business must have in order to be considered a
 22 30 qualifying business, removes "near equity" from the types of
 22 31 financing that will be considered in that calculation, requires
 22 32 that the financing be secured at the time of application for
 22 33 the tax credits, and requires that the business have at least
 22 34 two investors at the time of application for the tax credits.
 22 35 These modified eligibility requirements apply to businesses
 23  1 that submit an application to the EDA to be registered as a
 23  2 qualifying business on or after the effective date of this
 23  3 division of the bill, and businesses that submitted such an
 23  4 application to the EDA before the effective date of this
 23  5 division of the bill shall be governed by current law.
 23  6    The division provides for the confidentiality of certain
 23  7 information with regard to the tax credit.  The identity of
 23  8 a qualifying business, the identity of an investor and the
 23  9 qualifying business in which the investor made an equity
 23 10 investment, and the total number and amount of tax credits
 23 11 issued shall be considered public information under Code
 23 12 chapter 22 (examination of public records), but any other
 23 13 information or record in the possession of the EDA with respect
 23 14 to the program shall be presumed by the EDA to be a trade secret
 23 15 protected under Code chapter 550 or common law and shall be
 23 16 kept confidential by the EDA unless otherwise ordered by a
 23 17 court.
 23 18    The division takes effect upon enactment and applies to
 23 19 equity investments in a qualifying business made on or after
 23 20 that date.  Equity investments in a qualifying business or
 23 21 community=based seed capital fund made prior to the effective
 23 22 date of the division shall be governed by current law.
 23 23    DIVISION III ==== ENTREPRENEUR INVESTMENT AWARDS PROGRAM.
 23 24  Division III amends the entrepreneur investment awards program
 23 25 administered by the EDA.  The division strikes provisions that
 23 26 prohibited the EDA from making awards under the program since
 23 27 July 1, 2014, and that required the EDA by December 31, 2014,
 23 28 to conduct a comprehensive review of the program and submit
 23 29 a report with specified information to the governor and the
 23 30 general assembly.
 23 31    The division modifies the purpose of the program to be
 23 32 to provide financial assistance to eligible entrepreneurial
 23 33 assistance providers (provider) that provide technical and
 23 34 financial assistance to entrepreneurs and start=up companies
 23 35 seeking to create, locate, or expand a business in Iowa.
 24  1 "Financial assistance" is defined in the division.
 24  2    The division changes the requirements for receiving an
 24  3 award.  To be eligible to receive an award under current
 24  4 law, an entrepreneurial assistance program must have been
 24  5 an Iowa=based business, expended at least $500,000 during
 24  6 the previous fiscal year to provide technical and financial
 24  7 assistance services that meet the broad=based needs of
 24  8 entrepreneurs seeking to create, locate, or expand a business
 24  9 in Iowa that intends to derive more than 10 percent of its
 24 10 gross sales from markets outside Iowa; and must have engaged
 24 11 and communicated with certain other programs, funding sources,
 24 12 and entities for its entrepreneur clients.  The division
 24 13 amends the eligibility for receiving financial assistance to
 24 14 require that a provider have its principal place of operations
 24 15 in Iowa and that the provider offer a comprehensive set of
 24 16 business development services to emerging and early=stage
 24 17 innovation companies to assist in the creation, location,
 24 18 growth, and long=term success of the company in Iowa.
 24 19 "Business development services" is defined in the division.
 24 20 Business development services may be performed at the physical
 24 21 location of the provider or the company and may be provided in
 24 22 consideration of equity participation in the company, a fee for
 24 23 services, or a membership agreement with the company.
 24 24    Under current law, the EDA board could approve, deny, or
 24 25 defer each application for a grant, and was required to award
 24 26 grants on a first=come, first=served basis.  The division
 24 27 specifies that the EDA board has the discretion to approve,
 24 28 deny, or defer each application for financial assistance and
 24 29 that the amount of financial assistance awarded to a provider
 24 30 is within the discretion of the EDA.  The division requires
 24 31 the EDA to award financial assistance on a competitive basis
 24 32 and allows the EDA to develop scoring criteria and establish
 24 33 minimum requirements for the receipt of a financial assistance
 24 34 award.
 24 35    In addition to the four factors relating to the provider's
 25  1 professional staff that the EDA may consider under current
 25  2 law in deciding whether to award financial assistance, the
 25  3 division provides that the EDA may also consider the service
 25  4 model and likelihood of success of the provider, the provider's
 25  5 similarity to other successful providers in the country, and
 25  6 the provider's financial need.
 25  7    The division modifies the maximum award amount for a
 25  8 recipient.  Under current law, a grant to an entrepreneur
 25  9 assistance program cannot exceed the lesser of 25 percent of
 25 10 the funds expended by the program during the previous fiscal
 25 11 year, 100 percent of the funds raised from certain persons
 25 12 by the program during the previous fiscal year, or $200,000.
 25 13 The division provides that the amount of financial assistance
 25 14 awarded to any one provider shall not exceed $200,000.
 25 15    The division modifies the permitted use of funds received
 25 16 under the program.  Under current law, grants are only
 25 17 permitted to be used for the purpose of operating costs
 25 18 incurred by the program.  The division specifies that financial
 25 19 assistance awarded to a provider shall only be used for
 25 20 the purpose of operating costs incurred by the provider in
 25 21 the provision of business development services to emerging
 25 22 and early=stage innovation companies in Iowa.  The division
 25 23 further requires that such financial assistance shall not be
 25 24 distributed to owners or investors of the company to which the
 25 25 business development services are being provided and shall not
 25 26 be provided to other persons assisting with the provision of
 25 27 the services.
 25 28    Under current law, an entrepreneurial assistance provider is
 25 29 required to accept client referrals from the EDA as a condition
 25 30 of receiving a grant.  The division provides that the EDA may
 25 31 make client referrals to eligible providers.
 25 32    DIVISION IV ==== MISCELLANEOUS CHANGES.  Division IV makes
 25 33 several miscellaneous changes to other EDA programs.  The
 25 34 division amends the sales and use tax refund available under
 25 35 the workforce housing tax incentive program.  That refund
 26  1 is available for sales and use tax paid prior to project
 26  2 completion, which is currently defined to mean the first date
 26  3 upon which the average annualized production of finished
 26  4 product for the preceding 90=day period at the manufacturing
 26  5 facility operated by the eligible business is at least 50
 26  6 percent of the initial design capacity of the facility.  The
 26  7 division amends the definition of "project completion" to mean
 26  8 the date on which the EDA notifies the department of revenue
 26  9 that all applicable requirements of a workforce housing tax
 26 10 incentive program agreement are satisfied.  This provision
 26 11 takes effect upon enactment and applies retroactively to July
 26 12 1, 2014, for all workforce housing tax incentive agreements
 26 13 entered into on or after that date.
 26 14    The division allows the EDA to extend the project
 26 15 completion date for a project awarded tax incentives under the
 26 16 redevelopment tax credit program and the housing enterprise
 26 17 zone tax incentives program if the property that is the subject
 26 18 of the project suffered a catastrophic fire during the 2014
 26 19 calendar year.
       LSB 1212HV (3) 86
       mm/sc
 19 30 the program have been fulfilled, the EDA shall issue a tax
 19 31 credit and related tax credit certificate to the eligible
 19 32 business in an amount equal to the product of $.05 multiplied
 19 33 by the number of pounds of renewable chemicals produced in Iowa
 19 34 from biomass feedstock by the eligible business during the
 19 35 calendar year.  Renewable chemicals produced by an eligible
 20  1 business prior to the effective date of the division, or
 20  2 prior to the date the business first qualifies as an eligible
 20  3 business, or after calendar year 2025, shall not qualify for
 20  4 the tax credit.
 20  5    The tax credit shall be claimed for the tax year during
 20  6 which the eligible business was issued the tax credit.  The tax
 20  7 credit may be claimed against the individual income tax and the
 20  8 corporate income tax.  The credit is refundable or may, at the
 20  9 election of the taxpayer, be carried forward for up to one tax
 20 10 year.   The tax credit shall not be transferred to any person.  A
 20 11 tax credit issued to a partnership, limited liability company,
 20 12 S corporation, cooperative organized under Code chapter 501
 20 13 and filing as a partnership for federal tax purposes, estate,
 20 14 or trust electing to have the income taxed directly to the
 20 15 individual may be claimed by the individual based upon the pro
 20 16 rata share of the individual's earnings from that entity.
 20 17    The division provides that the program is subject to the
 20 18 EDA's maximum aggregate tax credit cap of $170 million per
 20 19 fiscal year in Code section 15.119, and not more than $15
 20 20 million per fiscal year may be issued by the EDA under the
 20 21 program.  In addition, the maximum amount of tax credit that
 20 22 may be issued to an eligible business in any one calendar year
 20 23 shall not exceed $1 million or $500,000, depending on whether
 20 24 the eligible business has been operating in Iowa at the time of
 20 25 application for five or fewer years, or more than five years,
 20 26 respectively.  An eligible business shall not receive more than
 20 27 five tax credits under the program.  The EDA is required to
 20 28 issue tax credits on a first=come, first=served basis until the
 20 29 maximum amount of $15 million per fiscal year is reached.  If
 20 30 the amount of tax credits exceeds this amount in a fiscal year,
 20 31 the EDA is required to establish a wait list and give priority
 20 32 in subsequent years to the eligible businesses on the wait
 20 33 list.
 20 34    The division provides for the confidentiality of certain
 20 35 information under the program.  The identity of a tax credit
 21  1 recipient and the amount of the tax credit shall be considered
 21  2 public information under Code chapter 22 (examination of public
 21  3 records), but any other information or record in the possession
 21  4 of the EDA with respect to the program shall be presumed by
 21  5 the EDA to be a trade secret protected under Code chapter 550
 21  6 or common law and shall be kept confidential by the EDA unless
 21  7 otherwise ordered by a court.
 21  8    The division takes effect upon enactment and applies to
 21  9 renewable chemicals produced in Iowa from biomass feedstock on
 21 10 or after that date.  The division applies retroactively to tax
 21 11 years beginning on or after January 1, 2015.
 21 12    DIVISION II ==== ANGEL INVESTOR TAX CREDITS.   Division II
 21 13 makes several changes to the tax credit for investments in
 21 14 qualifying businesses and community=based seed capital funds,
 21 15 often referred to as the angel investor tax credits.  The
 21 16 division amends the purpose of the tax credit in Code section
 21 17 15E.41.  The division excludes investments in community=based
 21 18 seed capital funds from qualifying for the tax credit and
 21 19 makes several conforming amendments to remove references to
 21 20 community=based seed capital funds from the Code.
 21 21    The division modifies the amount and dollar limitation of
 21 22 the tax credit for a taxpayer.  The tax credit is increased
 21 23 from 20 percent to 25 percent of a taxpayer's equity investment
 21 24 in a qualifying business.  Under current law, a taxpayer cannot
 21 25 claim more than $50,000 of tax credit per investment in a
 21 26 qualifying business, and for each tax year a taxpayer and the
 21 27 taxpayer's affiliates cannot claim tax credits for more than
 21 28 five investments in five different qualifying businesses.  The
 21 29 division amends this dollar limitation to prohibit a natural
 21 30 person and the person's spouse, child, or sibling from claiming
 21 31 a combined amount of more than $100,000 in tax credits per tax
 21 32 year.
 21 33    The division also provides that no more than $500,000 in tax
 21 34 credits may be issued per tax year for equity investments in
 21 35 any one qualifying business.
 22  1 The division modifies the procedures for claiming the tax
 22  2 credit.  Under current law, the tax credit is not refundable
 22  3 but available for carryforward for up to five tax years.  The
 22  4 division makes the tax credit refundable for an investment
 22  5 made by a natural person, and for any other person reduces the
 22  6 carryforward period to three years.
 22  7    The division strikes a provision permitting the EDA
 22  8 to cooperate with small business development centers to
 22  9 disseminate information regarding the credits and to develop
 22 10 standard application forms, and requiring the EDA to distribute
 22 11 copies of the application forms to all community=based seed
 22 12 capital funds and potential individual investors.
 22 13    The division modifies the eligibility requirements for
 22 14 qualifying businesses.  The division strikes the requirement
 22 15 that a business have an owner that meets at least one of
 22 16 four qualifications relating to business education or
 22 17 business experience.  The division requires that a business
 22 18 be participating in an entrepreneurial assistance program,
 22 19 as defined in the division, but allows the EDA to waive this
 22 20 requirement if the business establishes that its owners,
 22 21 directors, officers, and employees have an appropriate level
 22 22 of experience such that an entrepreneurial assistance program
 22 23 would not materially change the prospects of the business.
 22 24 The EDA is allowed to consult with outside service providers
 22 25 in considering such a waiver.  The division increases from $5
 22 26 million to $10 million the maximum amount of net worth that
 22 27 a business may have to be considered a qualifying business.
 22 28 The division increases from $250,000 to $500,000 the amount of
 22 29 financing that a business must have in order to be considered a
 22 30 qualifying business, removes "near equity" from the types of
 22 31 financing that will be considered in that calculation, requires
 22 32 that the financing be secured at the time of application for
 22 33 the tax credits, and requires that the business have at least
 22 34 two investors at the time of application for the tax credits.
 22 35 These modified eligibility requirements apply to businesses
 23  1 that submit an application to the EDA to be registered as a
 23  2 qualifying business on or after the effective date of this
 23  3 division of the bill, and businesses that submitted such an
 23  4 application to the EDA before the effective date of this
 23  5 division of the bill shall be governed by current law.
 23  6    The division provides for the confidentiality of certain
 23  7 information with regard to the tax credit.  The identity of
 23  8 a qualifying business, the identity of an investor and the
 23  9 qualifying business in which the investor made an equity
 23 10 investment, and the total number and amount of tax credits
 23 11 issued shall be considered public information under Code
 23 12 chapter 22 (examination of public records), but any other
 23 13 information or record in the possession of the EDA with respect
 23 14 to the program shall be presumed by the EDA to be a trade secret
 23 15 protected under Code chapter 550 or common law and shall be
 23 16 kept confidential by the EDA unless otherwise ordered by a
 23 17 court.
 23 18    The division takes effect upon enactment and applies to
 23 19 equity investments in a qualifying business made on or after
 23 20 that date.  Equity investments in a qualifying business or
 23 21 community=based seed capital fund made prior to the effective
 23 22 date of the division shall be governed by current law.
 23 23    DIVISION III ==== ENTREPRENEUR INVESTMENT AWARDS PROGRAM.
 23 24  Division III amends the entrepreneur investment awards program
 23 25 administered by the EDA.  The division strikes provisions that
 23 26 prohibited the EDA from making awards under the program since
 23 27 July 1, 2014, and that required the EDA by December 31, 2014,
 23 28 to conduct a comprehensive review of the program and submit
 23 29 a report with specified information to the governor and the
 23 30 general assembly.
 23 31    The division modifies the purpose of the program to be
 23 32 to provide financial assistance to eligible entrepreneurial
 23 33 assistance providers (provider) that provide technical and
 23 34 financial assistance to entrepreneurs and start=up companies
 23 35 seeking to create, locate, or expand a business in Iowa.
 24  1 "Financial assistance" is defined in the division.
 24  2    The division changes the requirements for receiving an
 24  3 award.  To be eligible to receive an award under current
 24  4 law, an entrepreneurial assistance program must have been
 24  5 an Iowa=based business, expended at least $500,000 during
 24  6 the previous fiscal year to provide technical and financial
 24  7 assistance services that meet the broad=based needs of
 24  8 entrepreneurs seeking to create, locate, or expand a business
 24  9 in Iowa that intends to derive more than 10 percent of its
 24 10 gross sales from markets outside Iowa; and must have engaged
 24 11 and communicated with certain other programs, funding sources,
 24 12 and entities for its entrepreneur clients.  The division
 24 13 amends the eligibility for receiving financial assistance to
 24 14 require that a provider have its principal place of operations
 24 15 in Iowa and that the provider offer a comprehensive set of
 24 16 business development services to emerging and early=stage
 24 17 innovation companies to assist in the creation, location,
 24 18 growth, and long=term success of the company in Iowa.
 24 19 "Business development services" is defined in the division.
 24 20 Business development services may be performed at the physical
 24 21 location of the provider or the company and may be provided in
 24 22 consideration of equity participation in the company, a fee for
 24 23 services, or a membership agreement with the company.
 24 24    Under current law, the EDA board could approve, deny, or
 24 25 defer each application for a grant, and was required to award
 24 26 grants on a first=come, first=served basis.  The division
 24 27 specifies that the EDA board has the discretion to approve,
 24 28 deny, or defer each application for financial assistance and
 24 29 that the amount of financial assistance awarded to a provider
 24 30 is within the discretion of the EDA.  The division requires
 24 31 the EDA to award financial assistance on a competitive basis
 24 32 and allows the EDA to develop scoring criteria and establish
 24 33 minimum requirements for the receipt of a financial assistance
 24 34 award.
 24 35    In addition to the four factors relating to the provider's
 25  1 professional staff that the EDA may consider under current
 25  2 law in deciding whether to award financial assistance, the
 25  3 division provides that the EDA may also consider the service
 25  4 model and likelihood of success of the provider, the provider's
 25  5 similarity to other successful providers in the country, and
 25  6 the provider's financial need.
 25  7    The division modifies the maximum award amount for a
 25  8 recipient.  Under current law, a grant to an entrepreneur
 25  9 assistance program cannot exceed the lesser of 25 percent of
 25 10 the funds expended by the program during the previous fiscal
 25 11 year, 100 percent of the funds raised from certain persons
 25 12 by the program during the previous fiscal year, or $200,000.
 25 13 The division provides that the amount of financial assistance
 25 14 awarded to any one provider shall not exceed $200,000.
 25 15    The division modifies the permitted use of funds received
 25 16 under the program.  Under current law, grants are only
 25 17 permitted to be used for the purpose of operating costs
 25 18 incurred by the program.  The division specifies that financial
 25 19 assistance awarded to a provider shall only be used for
 25 20 the purpose of operating costs incurred by the provider in
 25 21 the provision of business development services to emerging
 25 22 and early=stage innovation companies in Iowa.  The division
 25 23 further requires that such financial assistance shall not be
 25 24 distributed to owners or investors of the company to which the
 25 25 business development services are being provided and shall not
 25 26 be provided to other persons assisting with the provision of
 25 27 the services.
 25 28    Under current law, an entrepreneurial assistance provider is
 25 29 required to accept client referrals from the EDA as a condition
 25 30 of receiving a grant.  The division provides that the EDA may
 25 31 make client referrals to eligible providers.
 25 32    DIVISION IV ==== MISCELLANEOUS CHANGES.  Division IV makes
 25 33 several miscellaneous changes to other EDA programs.  The
 25 34 division amends the sales and use tax refund available under
 25 35 the workforce housing tax incentive program.  That refund
 26  1 is available for sales and use tax paid prior to project
 26  2 completion, which is currently defined to mean the first date
 26  3 upon which the average annualized production of finished
 26  4 product for the preceding 90=day period at the manufacturing
 26  5 facility operated by the eligible business is at least 50
 26  6 percent of the initial design capacity of the facility.  The
 26  7 division amends the definition of "project completion" to mean
 26  8 the date on which the EDA notifies the department of revenue
 26  9 that all applicable requirements of a workforce housing tax
 26 10 incentive program agreement are satisfied.  This provision
 26 11 takes effect upon enactment and applies retroactively to July
 26 12 1, 2014, for all workforce housing tax incentive agreements
 26 13 entered into on or after that date.
 26 14    The division allows the EDA to extend the project
 26 15 completion date for a project awarded tax incentives under the
 26 16 redevelopment tax credit program and the housing enterprise
 26 17 zone tax incentives program if the property that is the subject
 26 18 of the project suffered a catastrophic fire during the 2014
 26 19 calendar year.
       LSB 1212HV (3) 86
       mm/sc
 19 31 credit and related tax credit certificate to the eligible
 19 32 business in an amount equal to the product of $.05 multiplied
 19 33 by the number of pounds of renewable chemicals produced in Iowa
 19 34 from biomass feedstock by the eligible business during the
 19 35 calendar year.  Renewable chemicals produced by an eligible
 20  1 business prior to the effective date of the division, or
 20  2 prior to the date the business first qualifies as an eligible
 20  3 business, or after calendar year 2025, shall not qualify for
 20  4 the tax credit.
 20  5    The tax credit shall be claimed for the tax year during
 20  6 which the eligible business was issued the tax credit.  The tax
 20  7 credit may be claimed against the individual income tax and the
 20  8 corporate income tax.  The credit is refundable or may, at the
 20  9 election of the taxpayer, be carried forward for up to one tax
 20 10 year.   The tax credit shall not be transferred to any person.  A
 20 11 tax credit issued to a partnership, limited liability company,
 20 12 S corporation, cooperative organized under Code chapter 501
 20 13 and filing as a partnership for federal tax purposes, estate,
 20 14 or trust electing to have the income taxed directly to the
 20 15 individual may be claimed by the individual based upon the pro
 20 16 rata share of the individual's earnings from that entity.
 20 17    The division provides that the program is subject to the
 20 18 EDA's maximum aggregate tax credit cap of $170 million per
 20 19 fiscal year in Code section 15.119, and not more than $15
 20 20 million per fiscal year may be issued by the EDA under the
 20 21 program.  In addition, the maximum amount of tax credit that
 20 22 may be issued to an eligible business in any one calendar year
 20 23 shall not exceed $1 million or $500,000, depending on whether
 20 24 the eligible business has been operating in Iowa at the time of
 20 25 application for five or fewer years, or more than five years,
 20 26 respectively.  An eligible business shall not receive more than
 20 27 five tax credits under the program.  The EDA is required to
 20 28 issue tax credits on a first=come, first=served basis until the
 20 29 maximum amount of $15 million per fiscal year is reached.  If
 20 30 the amount of tax credits exceeds this amount in a fiscal year,
 20 31 the EDA is required to establish a wait list and give priority
 20 32 in subsequent years to the eligible businesses on the wait
 20 33 list.
 20 34    The division provides for the confidentiality of certain
 20 35 information under the program.  The identity of a tax credit
 21  1 recipient and the amount of the tax credit shall be considered
 21  2 public information under Code chapter 22 (examination of public
 21  3 records), but any other information or record in the possession
 21  4 of the EDA with respect to the program shall be presumed by
 21  5 the EDA to be a trade secret protected under Code chapter 550
 21  6 or common law and shall be kept confidential by the EDA unless
 21  7 otherwise ordered by a court.
 21  8    The division takes effect upon enactment and applies to
 21  9 renewable chemicals produced in Iowa from biomass feedstock on
 21 10 or after that date.  The division applies retroactively to tax
 21 11 years beginning on or after January 1, 2015.
 21 12    DIVISION II ==== ANGEL INVESTOR TAX CREDITS.   Division II
 21 13 makes several changes to the tax credit for investments in
 21 14 qualifying businesses and community=based seed capital funds,
 21 15 often referred to as the angel investor tax credits.  The
 21 16 division amends the purpose of the tax credit in Code section
 21 17 15E.41.  The division excludes investments in community=based
 21 18 seed capital funds from qualifying for the tax credit and
 21 19 makes several conforming amendments to remove references to
 21 20 community=based seed capital funds from the Code.
 21 21    The division modifies the amount and dollar limitation of
 21 22 the tax credit for a taxpayer.  The tax credit is increased
 21 23 from 20 percent to 25 percent of a taxpayer's equity investment
 21 24 in a qualifying business.  Under current law, a taxpayer cannot
 21 25 claim more than $50,000 of tax credit per investment in a
 21 26 qualifying business, and for each tax year a taxpayer and the
 21 27 taxpayer's affiliates cannot claim tax credits for more than
 21 28 five investments in five different qualifying businesses.  The
 21 29 division amends this dollar limitation to prohibit a natural
 21 30 person and the person's spouse, child, or sibling from claiming
 21 31 a combined amount of more than $100,000 in tax credits per tax
 21 32 year.
 21 33    The division also provides that no more than $500,000 in tax
 21 34 credits may be issued per tax year for equity investments in
 21 35 any one qualifying business.
 22  1 The division modifies the procedures for claiming the tax
 22  2 credit.  Under current law, the tax credit is not refundable
 22  3 but available for carryforward for up to five tax years.  The
 22  4 division makes the tax credit refundable for an investment
 22  5 made by a natural person, and for any other person reduces the
 22  6 carryforward period to three years.
 22  7    The division strikes a provision permitting the EDA
 22  8 to cooperate with small business development centers to
 22  9 disseminate information regarding the credits and to develop
 22 10 standard application forms, and requiring the EDA to distribute
 22 11 copies of the application forms to all community=based seed
 22 12 capital funds and potential individual investors.
 22 13    The division modifies the eligibility requirements for
 22 14 qualifying businesses.  The division strikes the requirement
 22 15 that a business have an owner that meets at least one of
 22 16 four qualifications relating to business education or
 22 17 business experience.  The division requires that a business
 22 18 be participating in an entrepreneurial assistance program,
 22 19 as defined in the division, but allows the EDA to waive this
 22 20 requirement if the business establishes that its owners,
 22 21 directors, officers, and employees have an appropriate level
 22 22 of experience such that an entrepreneurial assistance program
 22 23 would not materially change the prospects of the business.
 22 24 The EDA is allowed to consult with outside service providers
 22 25 in considering such a waiver.  The division increases from $5
 22 26 million to $10 million the maximum amount of net worth that
 22 27 a business may have to be considered a qualifying business.
 22 28 The division increases from $250,000 to $500,000 the amount of
 22 29 financing that a business must have in order to be considered a
 22 30 qualifying business, removes "near equity" from the types of
 22 31 financing that will be considered in that calculation, requires
 22 32 that the financing be secured at the time of application for
 22 33 the tax credits, and requires that the business have at least
 22 34 two investors at the time of application for the tax credits.
 22 35 These modified eligibility requirements apply to businesses
 23  1 that submit an application to the EDA to be registered as a
 23  2 qualifying business on or after the effective date of this
 23  3 division of the bill, and businesses that submitted such an
 23  4 application to the EDA before the effective date of this
 23  5 division of the bill shall be governed by current law.
 23  6    The division provides for the confidentiality of certain
 23  7 information with regard to the tax credit.  The identity of
 23  8 a qualifying business, the identity of an investor and the
 23  9 qualifying business in which the investor made an equity
 23 10 investment, and the total number and amount of tax credits
 23 11 issued shall be considered public information under Code
 23 12 chapter 22 (examination of public records), but any other
 23 13 information or record in the possession of the EDA with respect
 23 14 to the program shall be presumed by the EDA to be a trade secret
 23 15 protected under Code chapter 550 or common law and shall be
 23 16 kept confidential by the EDA unless otherwise ordered by a
 23 17 court.
 23 18    The division takes effect upon enactment and applies to
 23 19 equity investments in a qualifying business made on or after
 23 20 that date.  Equity investments in a qualifying business or
 23 21 community=based seed capital fund made prior to the effective
 23 22 date of the division shall be governed by current law.
 23 23    DIVISION III ==== ENTREPRENEUR INVESTMENT AWARDS PROGRAM.
 23 24  Division III amends the entrepreneur investment awards program
 23 25 administered by the EDA.  The division strikes provisions that
 23 26 prohibited the EDA from making awards under the program since
 23 27 July 1, 2014, and that required the EDA by December 31, 2014,
 23 28 to conduct a comprehensive review of the program and submit
 23 29 a report with specified information to the governor and the
 23 30 general assembly.
 23 31    The division modifies the purpose of the program to be
 23 32 to provide financial assistance to eligible entrepreneurial
 23 33 assistance providers (provider) that provide technical and
 23 34 financial assistance to entrepreneurs and start=up companies
 23 35 seeking to create, locate, or expand a business in Iowa.
 24  1 "Financial assistance" is defined in the division.
 24  2    The division changes the requirements for receiving an
 24  3 award.  To be eligible to receive an award under current
 24  4 law, an entrepreneurial assistance program must have been
 24  5 an Iowa=based business, expended at least $500,000 during
 24  6 the previous fiscal year to provide technical and financial
 24  7 assistance services that meet the broad=based needs of
 24  8 entrepreneurs seeking to create, locate, or expand a business
 24  9 in Iowa that intends to derive more than 10 percent of its
 24 10 gross sales from markets outside Iowa; and must have engaged
 24 11 and communicated with certain other programs, funding sources,
 24 12 and entities for its entrepreneur clients.  The division
 24 13 amends the eligibility for receiving financial assistance to
 24 14 require that a provider have its principal place of operations
 24 15 in Iowa and that the provider offer a comprehensive set of
 24 16 business development services to emerging and early=stage
 24 17 innovation companies to assist in the creation, location,
 24 18 growth, and long=term success of the company in Iowa.
 24 19 "Business development services" is defined in the division.
 24 20 Business development services may be performed at the physical
 24 21 location of the provider or the company and may be provided in
 24 22 consideration of equity participation in the company, a fee for
 24 23 services, or a membership agreement with the company.
 24 24    Under current law, the EDA board could approve, deny, or
 24 25 defer each application for a grant, and was required to award
 24 26 grants on a first=come, first=served basis.  The division
 24 27 specifies that the EDA board has the discretion to approve,
 24 28 deny, or defer each application for financial assistance and
 24 29 that the amount of financial assistance awarded to a provider
 24 30 is within the discretion of the EDA.  The division requires
 24 31 the EDA to award financial assistance on a competitive basis
 24 32 and allows the EDA to develop scoring criteria and establish
 24 33 minimum requirements for the receipt of a financial assistance
 24 34 award.
 24 35    In addition to the four factors relating to the provider's
 25  1 professional staff that the EDA may consider under current
 25  2 law in deciding whether to award financial assistance, the
 25  3 division provides that the EDA may also consider the service
 25  4 model and likelihood of success of the provider, the provider's
 25  5 similarity to other successful providers in the country, and
 25  6 the provider's financial need.
 25  7    The division modifies the maximum award amount for a
 25  8 recipient.  Under current law, a grant to an entrepreneur
 25  9 assistance program cannot exceed the lesser of 25 percent of
 25 10 the funds expended by the program during the previous fiscal
 25 11 year, 100 percent of the funds raised from certain persons
 25 12 by the program during the previous fiscal year, or $200,000.
 25 13 The division provides that the amount of financial assistance
 25 14 awarded to any one provider shall not exceed $200,000.
 25 15    The division modifies the permitted use of funds received
 25 16 under the program.  Under current law, grants are only
 25 17 permitted to be used for the purpose of operating costs
 25 18 incurred by the program.  The division specifies that financial
 25 19 assistance awarded to a provider shall only be used for
 25 20 the purpose of operating costs incurred by the provider in
 25 21 the provision of business development services to emerging
 25 22 and early=stage innovation companies in Iowa.  The division
 25 23 further requires that such financial assistance shall not be
 25 24 distributed to owners or investors of the company to which the
 25 25 business development services are being provided and shall not
 25 26 be provided to other persons assisting with the provision of
 25 27 the services.
 25 28    Under current law, an entrepreneurial assistance provider is
 25 29 required to accept client referrals from the EDA as a condition
 25 30 of receiving a grant.  The division provides that the EDA may
 25 31 make client referrals to eligible providers.
 25 32    DIVISION IV ==== MISCELLANEOUS CHANGES.  Division IV makes
 25 33 several miscellaneous changes to other EDA programs.  The
 25 34 division amends the sales and use tax refund available under
 25 35 the workforce housing tax incentive program.  That refund
 26  1 is available for sales and use tax paid prior to project
 26  2 completion, which is currently defined to mean the first date
 26  3 upon which the average annualized production of finished
 26  4 product for the preceding 90=day period at the manufacturing
 26  5 facility operated by the eligible business is at least 50
 26  6 percent of the initial design capacity of the facility.  The
 26  7 division amends the definition of "project completion" to mean
 26  8 the date on which the EDA notifies the department of revenue
 26  9 that all applicable requirements of a workforce housing tax
 26 10 incentive program agreement are satisfied.  This provision
 26 11 takes effect upon enactment and applies retroactively to July
 26 12 1, 2014, for all workforce housing tax incentive agreements
 26 13 entered into on or after that date.
 26 14    The division allows the EDA to extend the project
 26 15 completion date for a project awarded tax incentives under the
 26 16 redevelopment tax credit program and the housing enterprise
 26 17 zone tax incentives program if the property that is the subject
 26 18 of the project suffered a catastrophic fire during the 2014
 26 19 calendar year.

 19 32 business in an amount equal to the product of $.05 multiplied
 19 33 by the number of pounds of renewable chemicals produced in Iowa
 19 34 from biomass feedstock by the eligible business during the
 19 35 calendar year.  Renewable chemicals produced by an eligible
 20  1 business prior to the effective date of the division, or
 20  2 prior to the date the business first qualifies as an eligible
 20  3 business, or after calendar year 2025, shall not qualify for
 20  4 the tax credit.
 20  5    The tax credit shall be claimed for the tax year during
 20  6 which the eligible business was issued the tax credit.  The tax
 20  7 credit may be claimed against the individual income tax and the
 20  8 corporate income tax.  The credit is refundable or may, at the
 20  9 election of the taxpayer, be carried forward for up to one tax
 20 10 year.   The tax credit shall not be transferred to any person.  A
 20 11 tax credit issued to a partnership, limited liability company,
 20 12 S corporation, cooperative organized under Code chapter 501
 20 13 and filing as a partnership for federal tax purposes, estate,
 20 14 or trust electing to have the income taxed directly to the
 20 15 individual may be claimed by the individual based upon the pro
 20 16 rata share of the individual's earnings from that entity.
 20 17    The division provides that the program is subject to the
 20 18 EDA's maximum aggregate tax credit cap of $170 million per
 20 19 fiscal year in Code section 15.119, and not more than $15
 20 20 million per fiscal year may be issued by the EDA under the
 20 21 program.  In addition, the maximum amount of tax credit that
 20 22 may be issued to an eligible business in any one calendar year
 20 23 shall not exceed $1 million or $500,000, depending on whether
 20 24 the eligible business has been operating in Iowa at the time of
 20 25 application for five or fewer years, or more than five years,
 20 26 respectively.  An eligible business shall not receive more than
 20 27 five tax credits under the program.  The EDA is required to
 20 28 issue tax credits on a first=come, first=served basis until the
 20 29 maximum amount of $15 million per fiscal year is reached.  If
 20 30 the amount of tax credits exceeds this amount in a fiscal year,
 20 31 the EDA is required to establish a wait list and give priority
 20 32 in subsequent years to the eligible businesses on the wait
 20 33 list.
 20 34    The division provides for the confidentiality of certain
 20 35 information under the program.  The identity of a tax credit
 21  1 recipient and the amount of the tax credit shall be considered
 21  2 public information under Code chapter 22 (examination of public
 21  3 records), but any other information or record in the possession
 21  4 of the EDA with respect to the program shall be presumed by
 21  5 the EDA to be a trade secret protected under Code chapter 550
 21  6 or common law and shall be kept confidential by the EDA unless
 21  7 otherwise ordered by a court.
 21  8    The division takes effect upon enactment and applies to
 21  9 renewable chemicals produced in Iowa from biomass feedstock on
 21 10 or after that date.  The division applies retroactively to tax
 21 11 years beginning on or after January 1, 2015.
 21 12    DIVISION II ==== ANGEL INVESTOR TAX CREDITS.   Division II
 21 13 makes several changes to the tax credit for investments in
 21 14 qualifying businesses and community=based seed capital funds,
 21 15 often referred to as the angel investor tax credits.  The
 21 16 division amends the purpose of the tax credit in Code section
 21 17 15E.41.  The division excludes investments in community=based
 21 18 seed capital funds from qualifying for the tax credit and
 21 19 makes several conforming amendments to remove references to
 21 20 community=based seed capital funds from the Code.
 21 21    The division modifies the amount and dollar limitation of
 21 22 the tax credit for a taxpayer.  The tax credit is increased
 21 23 from 20 percent to 25 percent of a taxpayer's equity investment
 21 24 in a qualifying business.  Under current law, a taxpayer cannot
 21 25 claim more than $50,000 of tax credit per investment in a
 21 26 qualifying business, and for each tax year a taxpayer and the
 21 27 taxpayer's affiliates cannot claim tax credits for more than
 21 28 five investments in five different qualifying businesses.  The
 21 29 division amends this dollar limitation to prohibit a natural
 21 30 person and the person's spouse, child, or sibling from claiming
 21 31 a combined amount of more than $100,000 in tax credits per tax
 21 32 year.
 21 33    The division also provides that no more than $500,000 in tax
 21 34 credits may be issued per tax year for equity investments in
 21 35 any one qualifying business.
 22  1 The division modifies the procedures for claiming the tax
 22  2 credit.  Under current law, the tax credit is not refundable
 22  3 but available for carryforward for up to five tax years.  The
 22  4 division makes the tax credit refundable for an investment
 22  5 made by a natural person, and for any other person reduces the
 22  6 carryforward period to three years.
 22  7    The division strikes a provision permitting the EDA
 22  8 to cooperate with small business development centers to
 22  9 disseminate information regarding the credits and to develop
 22 10 standard application forms, and requiring the EDA to distribute
 22 11 copies of the application forms to all community=based seed
 22 12 capital funds and potential individual investors.
 22 13    The division modifies the eligibility requirements for
 22 14 qualifying businesses.  The division strikes the requirement
 22 15 that a business have an owner that meets at least one of
 22 16 four qualifications relating to business education or
 22 17 business experience.  The division requires that a business
 22 18 be participating in an entrepreneurial assistance program,
 22 19 as defined in the division, but allows the EDA to waive this
 22 20 requirement if the business establishes that its owners,
 22 21 directors, officers, and employees have an appropriate level
 22 22 of experience such that an entrepreneurial assistance program
 22 23 would not materially change the prospects of the business.
 22 24 The EDA is allowed to consult with outside service providers
 22 25 in considering such a waiver.  The division increases from $5
 22 26 million to $10 million the maximum amount of net worth that
 22 27 a business may have to be considered a qualifying business.
 22 28 The division increases from $250,000 to $500,000 the amount of
 22 29 financing that a business must have in order to be considered a
 22 30 qualifying business, removes "near equity" from the types of
 22 31 financing that will be considered in that calculation, requires
 22 32 that the financing be secured at the time of application for
 22 33 the tax credits, and requires that the business have at least
 22 34 two investors at the time of application for the tax credits.
 22 35 These modified eligibility requirements apply to businesses
 23  1 that submit an application to the EDA to be registered as a
 23  2 qualifying business on or after the effective date of this
 23  3 division of the bill, and businesses that submitted such an
 23  4 application to the EDA before the effective date of this
 23  5 division of the bill shall be governed by current law.
 23  6    The division provides for the confidentiality of certain
 23  7 information with regard to the tax credit.  The identity of
 23  8 a qualifying business, the identity of an investor and the
 23  9 qualifying business in which the investor made an equity
 23 10 investment, and the total number and amount of tax credits
 23 11 issued shall be considered public information under Code
 23 12 chapter 22 (examination of public records), but any other
 23 13 information or record in the possession of the EDA with respect
 23 14 to the program shall be presumed by the EDA to be a trade secret
 23 15 protected under Code chapter 550 or common law and shall be
 23 16 kept confidential by the EDA unless otherwise ordered by a
 23 17 court.
 23 18    The division takes effect upon enactment and applies to
 23 19 equity investments in a qualifying business made on or after
 23 20 that date.  Equity investments in a qualifying business or
 23 21 community=based seed capital fund made prior to the effective
 23 22 date of the division shall be governed by current law.
 23 23    DIVISION III ==== ENTREPRENEUR INVESTMENT AWARDS PROGRAM.
 23 24  Division III amends the entrepreneur investment awards program
 23 25 administered by the EDA.  The division strikes provisions that
 23 26 prohibited the EDA from making awards under the program since
 23 27 July 1, 2014, and that required the EDA by December 31, 2014,
 23 28 to conduct a comprehensive review of the program and submit
 23 29 a report with specified information to the governor and the
 23 30 general assembly.
 23 31    The division modifies the purpose of the program to be
 23 32 to provide financial assistance to eligible entrepreneurial
 23 33 assistance providers (provider) that provide technical and
 23 34 financial assistance to entrepreneurs and start=up companies
 23 35 seeking to create, locate, or expand a business in Iowa.
 24  1 "Financial assistance" is defined in the division.
 24  2    The division changes the requirements for receiving an
 24  3 award.  To be eligible to receive an award under current
 24  4 law, an entrepreneurial assistance program must have been
 24  5 an Iowa=based business, expended at least $500,000 during
 24  6 the previous fiscal year to provide technical and financial
 24  7 assistance services that meet the broad=based needs of
 24  8 entrepreneurs seeking to create, locate, or expand a business
 24  9 in Iowa that intends to derive more than 10 percent of its
 24 10 gross sales from markets outside Iowa; and must have engaged
 24 11 and communicated with certain other programs, funding sources,
 24 12 and entities for its entrepreneur clients.  The division
 24 13 amends the eligibility for receiving financial assistance to
 24 14 require that a provider have its principal place of operations
 24 15 in Iowa and that the provider offer a comprehensive set of
 24 16 business development services to emerging and early=stage
 24 17 innovation companies to assist in the creation, location,
 24 18 growth, and long=term success of the company in Iowa.
 24 19 "Business development services" is defined in the division.
 24 20 Business development services may be performed at the physical
 24 21 location of the provider or the company and may be provided in
 24 22 consideration of equity participation in the company, a fee for
 24 23 services, or a membership agreement with the company.
 24 24    Under current law, the EDA board could approve, deny, or
 24 25 defer each application for a grant, and was required to award
 24 26 grants on a first=come, first=served basis.  The division
 24 27 specifies that the EDA board has the discretion to approve,
 24 28 deny, or defer each application for financial assistance and
 24 29 that the amount of financial assistance awarded to a provider
 24 30 is within the discretion of the EDA.  The division requires
 24 31 the EDA to award financial assistance on a competitive basis
 24 32 and allows the EDA to develop scoring criteria and establish
 24 33 minimum requirements for the receipt of a financial assistance
 24 34 award.
 24 35    In addition to the four factors relating to the provider's
 25  1 professional staff that the EDA may consider under current
 25  2 law in deciding whether to award financial assistance, the
 25  3 division provides that the EDA may also consider the service
 25  4 model and likelihood of success of the provider, the provider's
 25  5 similarity to other successful providers in the country, and
 25  6 the provider's financial need.
 25  7    The division modifies the maximum award amount for a
 25  8 recipient.  Under current law, a grant to an entrepreneur
 25  9 assistance program cannot exceed the lesser of 25 percent of
 25 10 the funds expended by the program during the previous fiscal
 25 11 year, 100 percent of the funds raised from certain persons
 25 12 by the program during the previous fiscal year, or $200,000.
 25 13 The division provides that the amount of financial assistance
 25 14 awarded to any one provider shall not exceed $200,000.
 25 15    The division modifies the permitted use of funds received
 25 16 under the program.  Under current law, grants are only
 25 17 permitted to be used for the purpose of operating costs
 25 18 incurred by the program.  The division specifies that financial
 25 19 assistance awarded to a provider shall only be used for
 25 20 the purpose of operating costs incurred by the provider in
 25 21 the provision of business development services to emerging
 25 22 and early=stage innovation companies in Iowa.  The division
 25 23 further requires that such financial assistance shall not be
 25 24 distributed to owners or investors of the company to which the
 25 25 business development services are being provided and shall not
 25 26 be provided to other persons assisting with the provision of
 25 27 the services.
 25 28    Under current law, an entrepreneurial assistance provider is
 25 29 required to accept client referrals from the EDA as a condition
 25 30 of receiving a grant.  The division provides that the EDA may
 25 31 make client referrals to eligible providers.
 25 32    DIVISION IV ==== MISCELLANEOUS CHANGES.  Division IV makes
 25 33 several miscellaneous changes to other EDA programs.  The
 25 34 division amends the sales and use tax refund available under
 25 35 the workforce housing tax incentive program.  That refund
 26  1 is available for sales and use tax paid prior to project
 26  2 completion, which is currently defined to mean the first date
 26  3 upon which the average annualized production of finished
 26  4 product for the preceding 90=day period at the manufacturing
 26  5 facility operated by the eligible business is at least 50
 26  6 percent of the initial design capacity of the facility.  The
 26  7 division amends the definition of "project completion" to mean
 26  8 the date on which the EDA notifies the department of revenue
 26  9 that all applicable requirements of a workforce housing tax
 26 10 incentive program agreement are satisfied.  This provision
 26 11 takes effect upon enactment and applies retroactively to July
 26 12 1, 2014, for all workforce housing tax incentive agreements
 26 13 entered into on or after that date.
 26 14    The division allows the EDA to extend the project
 26 15 completion date for a project awarded tax incentives under the
 26 16 redevelopment tax credit program and the housing enterprise
 26 17 zone tax incentives program if the property that is the subject
 26 18 of the project suffered a catastrophic fire during the 2014
 26 19 calendar year.
       LSB 1212HV (3) 86
       mm/sc
 19 33 by the number of pounds of renewable chemicals produced in Iowa
 19 34 from biomass feedstock by the eligible business during the
 19 35 calendar year.  Renewable chemicals produced by an eligible
 20  1 business prior to the effective date of the division, or
 20  2 prior to the date the business first qualifies as an eligible
 20  3 business, or after calendar year 2025, shall not qualify for
 20  4 the tax credit.
 20  5    The tax credit shall be claimed for the tax year during
 20  6 which the eligible business was issued the tax credit.  The tax
 20  7 credit may be claimed against the individual income tax and the
 20  8 corporate income tax.  The credit is refundable or may, at the
 20  9 election of the taxpayer, be carried forward for up to one tax
 20 10 year.   The tax credit shall not be transferred to any person.  A
 20 11 tax credit issued to a partnership, limited liability company,
 20 12 S corporation, cooperative organized under Code chapter 501
 20 13 and filing as a partnership for federal tax purposes, estate,
 20 14 or trust electing to have the income taxed directly to the
 20 15 individual may be claimed by the individual based upon the pro
 20 16 rata share of the individual's earnings from that entity.
 20 17    The division provides that the program is subject to the
 20 18 EDA's maximum aggregate tax credit cap of $170 million per
 20 19 fiscal year in Code section 15.119, and not more than $15
 20 20 million per fiscal year may be issued by the EDA under the
 20 21 program.  In addition, the maximum amount of tax credit that
 20 22 may be issued to an eligible business in any one calendar year
 20 23 shall not exceed $1 million or $500,000, depending on whether
 20 24 the eligible business has been operating in Iowa at the time of
 20 25 application for five or fewer years, or more than five years,
 20 26 respectively.  An eligible business shall not receive more than
 20 27 five tax credits under the program.  The EDA is required to
 20 28 issue tax credits on a first=come, first=served basis until the
 20 29 maximum amount of $15 million per fiscal year is reached.  If
 20 30 the amount of tax credits exceeds this amount in a fiscal year,
 20 31 the EDA is required to establish a wait list and give priority
 20 32 in subsequent years to the eligible businesses on the wait
 20 33 list.
 20 34    The division provides for the confidentiality of certain
 20 35 information under the program.  The identity of a tax credit
 21  1 recipient and the amount of the tax credit shall be considered
 21  2 public information under Code chapter 22 (examination of public
 21  3 records), but any other information or record in the possession
 21  4 of the EDA with respect to the program shall be presumed by
 21  5 the EDA to be a trade secret protected under Code chapter 550
 21  6 or common law and shall be kept confidential by the EDA unless
 21  7 otherwise ordered by a court.
 21  8    The division takes effect upon enactment and applies to
 21  9 renewable chemicals produced in Iowa from biomass feedstock on
 21 10 or after that date.  The division applies retroactively to tax
 21 11 years beginning on or after January 1, 2015.
 21 12    DIVISION II ==== ANGEL INVESTOR TAX CREDITS.   Division II
 21 13 makes several changes to the tax credit for investments in
 21 14 qualifying businesses and community=based seed capital funds,
 21 15 often referred to as the angel investor tax credits.  The
 21 16 division amends the purpose of the tax credit in Code section
 21 17 15E.41.  The division excludes investments in community=based
 21 18 seed capital funds from qualifying for the tax credit and
 21 19 makes several conforming amendments to remove references to
 21 20 community=based seed capital funds from the Code.
 21 21    The division modifies the amount and dollar limitation of
 21 22 the tax credit for a taxpayer.  The tax credit is increased
 21 23 from 20 percent to 25 percent of a taxpayer's equity investment
 21 24 in a qualifying business.  Under current law, a taxpayer cannot
 21 25 claim more than $50,000 of tax credit per investment in a
 21 26 qualifying business, and for each tax year a taxpayer and the
 21 27 taxpayer's affiliates cannot claim tax credits for more than
 21 28 five investments in five different qualifying businesses.  The
 21 29 division amends this dollar limitation to prohibit a natural
 21 30 person and the person's spouse, child, or sibling from claiming
 21 31 a combined amount of more than $100,000 in tax credits per tax
 21 32 year.
 21 33    The division also provides that no more than $500,000 in tax
 21 34 credits may be issued per tax year for equity investments in
 21 35 any one qualifying business.
 22  1 The division modifies the procedures for claiming the tax
 22  2 credit.  Under current law, the tax credit is not refundable
 22  3 but available for carryforward for up to five tax years.  The
 22  4 division makes the tax credit refundable for an investment
 22  5 made by a natural person, and for any other person reduces the
 22  6 carryforward period to three years.
 22  7    The division strikes a provision permitting the EDA
 22  8 to cooperate with small business development centers to
 22  9 disseminate information regarding the credits and to develop
 22 10 standard application forms, and requiring the EDA to distribute
 22 11 copies of the application forms to all community=based seed
 22 12 capital funds and potential individual investors.
 22 13    The division modifies the eligibility requirements for
 22 14 qualifying businesses.  The division strikes the requirement
 22 15 that a business have an owner that meets at least one of
 22 16 four qualifications relating to business education or
 22 17 business experience.  The division requires that a business
 22 18 be participating in an entrepreneurial assistance program,
 22 19 as defined in the division, but allows the EDA to waive this
 22 20 requirement if the business establishes that its owners,
 22 21 directors, officers, and employees have an appropriate level
 22 22 of experience such that an entrepreneurial assistance program
 22 23 would not materially change the prospects of the business.
 22 24 The EDA is allowed to consult with outside service providers
 22 25 in considering such a waiver.  The division increases from $5
 22 26 million to $10 million the maximum amount of net worth that
 22 27 a business may have to be considered a qualifying business.
 22 28 The division increases from $250,000 to $500,000 the amount of
 22 29 financing that a business must have in order to be considered a
 22 30 qualifying business, removes "near equity" from the types of
 22 31 financing that will be considered in that calculation, requires
 22 32 that the financing be secured at the time of application for
 22 33 the tax credits, and requires that the business have at least
 22 34 two investors at the time of application for the tax credits.
 22 35 These modified eligibility requirements apply to businesses
 23  1 that submit an application to the EDA to be registered as a
 23  2 qualifying business on or after the effective date of this
 23  3 division of the bill, and businesses that submitted such an
 23  4 application to the EDA before the effective date of this
 23  5 division of the bill shall be governed by current law.
 23  6    The division provides for the confidentiality of certain
 23  7 information with regard to the tax credit.  The identity of
 23  8 a qualifying business, the identity of an investor and the
 23  9 qualifying business in which the investor made an equity
 23 10 investment, and the total number and amount of tax credits
 23 11 issued shall be considered public information under Code
 23 12 chapter 22 (examination of public records), but any other
 23 13 information or record in the possession of the EDA with respect
 23 14 to the program shall be presumed by the EDA to be a trade secret
 23 15 protected under Code chapter 550 or common law and shall be
 23 16 kept confidential by the EDA unless otherwise ordered by a
 23 17 court.
 23 18    The division takes effect upon enactment and applies to
 23 19 equity investments in a qualifying business made on or after
 23 20 that date.  Equity investments in a qualifying business or
 23 21 community=based seed capital fund made prior to the effective
 23 22 date of the division shall be governed by current law.
 23 23    DIVISION III ==== ENTREPRENEUR INVESTMENT AWARDS PROGRAM.
 23 24  Division III amends the entrepreneur investment awards program
 23 25 administered by the EDA.  The division strikes provisions that
 23 26 prohibited the EDA from making awards under the program since
 23 27 July 1, 2014, and that required the EDA by December 31, 2014,
 23 28 to conduct a comprehensive review of the program and submit
 23 29 a report with specified information to the governor and the
 23 30 general assembly.
 23 31    The division modifies the purpose of the program to be
 23 32 to provide financial assistance to eligible entrepreneurial
 23 33 assistance providers (provider) that provide technical and
 23 34 financial assistance to entrepreneurs and start=up companies
 23 35 seeking to create, locate, or expand a business in Iowa.
 24  1 "Financial assistance" is defined in the division.
 24  2    The division changes the requirements for receiving an
 24  3 award.  To be eligible to receive an award under current
 24  4 law, an entrepreneurial assistance program must have been
 24  5 an Iowa=based business, expended at least $500,000 during
 24  6 the previous fiscal year to provide technical and financial
 24  7 assistance services that meet the broad=based needs of
 24  8 entrepreneurs seeking to create, locate, or expand a business
 24  9 in Iowa that intends to derive more than 10 percent of its
 24 10 gross sales from markets outside Iowa; and must have engaged
 24 11 and communicated with certain other programs, funding sources,
 24 12 and entities for its entrepreneur clients.  The division
 24 13 amends the eligibility for receiving financial assistance to
 24 14 require that a provider have its principal place of operations
 24 15 in Iowa and that the provider offer a comprehensive set of
 24 16 business development services to emerging and early=stage
 24 17 innovation companies to assist in the creation, location,
 24 18 growth, and long=term success of the company in Iowa.
 24 19 "Business development services" is defined in the division.
 24 20 Business development services may be performed at the physical
 24 21 location of the provider or the company and may be provided in
 24 22 consideration of equity participation in the company, a fee for
 24 23 services, or a membership agreement with the company.
 24 24    Under current law, the EDA board could approve, deny, or
 24 25 defer each application for a grant, and was required to award
 24 26 grants on a first=come, first=served basis.  The division
 24 27 specifies that the EDA board has the discretion to approve,
 24 28 deny, or defer each application for financial assistance and
 24 29 that the amount of financial assistance awarded to a provider
 24 30 is within the discretion of the EDA.  The division requires
 24 31 the EDA to award financial assistance on a competitive basis
 24 32 and allows the EDA to develop scoring criteria and establish
 24 33 minimum requirements for the receipt of a financial assistance
 24 34 award.
 24 35    In addition to the four factors relating to the provider's
 25  1 professional staff that the EDA may consider under current
 25  2 law in deciding whether to award financial assistance, the
 25  3 division provides that the EDA may also consider the service
 25  4 model and likelihood of success of the provider, the provider's
 25  5 similarity to other successful providers in the country, and
 25  6 the provider's financial need.
 25  7    The division modifies the maximum award amount for a
 25  8 recipient.  Under current law, a grant to an entrepreneur
 25  9 assistance program cannot exceed the lesser of 25 percent of
 25 10 the funds expended by the program during the previous fiscal
 25 11 year, 100 percent of the funds raised from certain persons
 25 12 by the program during the previous fiscal year, or $200,000.
 25 13 The division provides that the amount of financial assistance
 25 14 awarded to any one provider shall not exceed $200,000.
 25 15    The division modifies the permitted use of funds received
 25 16 under the program.  Under current law, grants are only
 25 17 permitted to be used for the purpose of operating costs
 25 18 incurred by the program.  The division specifies that financial
 25 19 assistance awarded to a provider shall only be used for
 25 20 the purpose of operating costs incurred by the provider in
 25 21 the provision of business development services to emerging
 25 22 and early=stage innovation companies in Iowa.  The division
 25 23 further requires that such financial assistance shall not be
 25 24 distributed to owners or investors of the company to which the
 25 25 business development services are being provided and shall not
 25 26 be provided to other persons assisting with the provision of
 25 27 the services.
 25 28    Under current law, an entrepreneurial assistance provider is
 25 29 required to accept client referrals from the EDA as a condition
 25 30 of receiving a grant.  The division provides that the EDA may
 25 31 make client referrals to eligible providers.
 25 32    DIVISION IV ==== MISCELLANEOUS CHANGES.  Division IV makes
 25 33 several miscellaneous changes to other EDA programs.  The
 25 34 division amends the sales and use tax refund available under
 25 35 the workforce housing tax incentive program.  That refund
 26  1 is available for sales and use tax paid prior to project
 26  2 completion, which is currently defined to mean the first date
 26  3 upon which the average annualized production of finished
 26  4 product for the preceding 90=day period at the manufacturing
 26  5 facility operated by the eligible business is at least 50
 26  6 percent of the initial design capacity of the facility.  The
 26  7 division amends the definition of "project completion" to mean
 26  8 the date on which the EDA notifies the department of revenue
 26  9 that all applicable requirements of a workforce housing tax
 26 10 incentive program agreement are satisfied.  This provision
 26 11 takes effect upon enactment and applies retroactively to July
 26 12 1, 2014, for all workforce housing tax incentive agreements
 26 13 entered into on or after that date.
 26 14    The division allows the EDA to extend the project
 26 15 completion date for a project awarded tax incentives under the
 26 16 redevelopment tax credit program and the housing enterprise
 26 17 zone tax incentives program if the property that is the subject
 26 18 of the project suffered a catastrophic fire during the 2014

 19 35 calendar year.  Renewable chemicals produced by an eligible
 20  1 business prior to the effective date of the division, or
 20  2 prior to the date the business first qualifies as an eligible
 20  3 business, or after calendar year 2025, shall not qualify for
 20  4 the tax credit.
 20  5    The tax credit shall be claimed for the tax year during
 20  6 which the eligible business was issued the tax credit.  The tax
 20  7 credit may be claimed against the individual income tax and the
 20  8 corporate income tax.  The credit is refundable or may, at the
 20  9 election of the taxpayer, be carried forward for up to one tax
 20 10 year.   The tax credit shall not be transferred to any person.  A
 20 11 tax credit issued to a partnership, limited liability company,
 20 12 S corporation, cooperative organized under Code chapter 501
 20 13 and filing as a partnership for federal tax purposes, estate,
 20 14 or trust electing to have the income taxed directly to the
 20 15 individual may be claimed by the individual based upon the pro
 20 16 rata share of the individual's earnings from that entity.
 20 17    The division provides that the program is subject to the
 20 18 EDA's maximum aggregate tax credit cap of $170 million per
 20 19 fiscal year in Code section 15.119, and not more than $15
 20 20 million per fiscal year may be issued by the EDA under the
 20 21 program.  In addition, the maximum amount of tax credit that
 20 22 may be issued to an eligible business in any one calendar year
 20 23 shall not exceed $1 million or $500,000, depending on whether
 20 24 the eligible business has been operating in Iowa at the time of
 20 25 application for five or fewer years, or more than five years,
 20 26 respectively.  An eligible business shall not receive more than
 20 27 five tax credits under the program.  The EDA is required to
 20 28 issue tax credits on a first=come, first=served basis until the
 20 29 maximum amount of $15 million per fiscal year is reached.  If
 20 30 the amount of tax credits exceeds this amount in a fiscal year,
 20 31 the EDA is required to establish a wait list and give priority
 20 32 in subsequent years to the eligible businesses on the wait
 20 33 list.
 20 34    The division provides for the confidentiality of certain
 20 35 information under the program.  The identity of a tax credit
 21  1 recipient and the amount of the tax credit shall be considered
 21  2 public information under Code chapter 22 (examination of public
 21  3 records), but any other information or record in the possession
 21  4 of the EDA with respect to the program shall be presumed by
 21  5 the EDA to be a trade secret protected under Code chapter 550
 21  6 or common law and shall be kept confidential by the EDA unless
 21  7 otherwise ordered by a court.
 21  8    The division takes effect upon enactment and applies to
 21  9 renewable chemicals produced in Iowa from biomass feedstock on
 21 10 or after that date.  The division applies retroactively to tax
 21 11 years beginning on or after January 1, 2015.
 21 12    DIVISION II ==== ANGEL INVESTOR TAX CREDITS.   Division II
 21 13 makes several changes to the tax credit for investments in
 21 14 qualifying businesses and community=based seed capital funds,
 21 15 often referred to as the angel investor tax credits.  The
 21 16 division amends the purpose of the tax credit in Code section
 21 17 15E.41.  The division excludes investments in community=based
 21 18 seed capital funds from qualifying for the tax credit and
 21 19 makes several conforming amendments to remove references to
 21 20 community=based seed capital funds from the Code.
 21 21    The division modifies the amount and dollar limitation of
 21 22 the tax credit for a taxpayer.  The tax credit is increased
 21 23 from 20 percent to 25 percent of a taxpayer's equity investment
 21 24 in a qualifying business.  Under current law, a taxpayer cannot
 21 25 claim more than $50,000 of tax credit per investment in a
 21 26 qualifying business, and for each tax year a taxpayer and the
 21 27 taxpayer's affiliates cannot claim tax credits for more than
 21 28 five investments in five different qualifying businesses.  The
 21 29 division amends this dollar limitation to prohibit a natural
 21 30 person and the person's spouse, child, or sibling from claiming
 21 31 a combined amount of more than $100,000 in tax credits per tax
 21 32 year.
 21 33    The division also provides that no more than $500,000 in tax
 21 34 credits may be issued per tax year for equity investments in
 21 35 any one qualifying business.
 22  1 The division modifies the procedures for claiming the tax
 22  2 credit.  Under current law, the tax credit is not refundable
 22  3 but available for carryforward for up to five tax years.  The
 22  4 division makes the tax credit refundable for an investment
 22  5 made by a natural person, and for any other person reduces the
 22  6 carryforward period to three years.
 22  7    The division strikes a provision permitting the EDA
 22  8 to cooperate with small business development centers to
 22  9 disseminate information regarding the credits and to develop
 22 10 standard application forms, and requiring the EDA to distribute
 22 11 copies of the application forms to all community=based seed
 22 12 capital funds and potential individual investors.
 22 13    The division modifies the eligibility requirements for
 22 14 qualifying businesses.  The division strikes the requirement
 22 15 that a business have an owner that meets at least one of
 22 16 four qualifications relating to business education or
 22 17 business experience.  The division requires that a business
 22 18 be participating in an entrepreneurial assistance program,
 22 19 as defined in the division, but allows the EDA to waive this
 22 20 requirement if the business establishes that its owners,
 22 21 directors, officers, and employees have an appropriate level
 22 22 of experience such that an entrepreneurial assistance program
 22 23 would not materially change the prospects of the business.
 22 24 The EDA is allowed to consult with outside service providers
 22 25 in considering such a waiver.  The division increases from $5
 22 26 million to $10 million the maximum amount of net worth that
 22 27 a business may have to be considered a qualifying business.
 22 28 The division increases from $250,000 to $500,000 the amount of
 22 29 financing that a business must have in order to be considered a
 22 30 qualifying business, removes "near equity" from the types of
 22 31 financing that will be considered in that calculation, requires
 22 32 that the financing be secured at the time of application for
 22 33 the tax credits, and requires that the business have at least
 22 34 two investors at the time of application for the tax credits.
 22 35 These modified eligibility requirements apply to businesses
 23  1 that submit an application to the EDA to be registered as a
 23  2 qualifying business on or after the effective date of this
 23  3 division of the bill, and businesses that submitted such an
 23  4 application to the EDA before the effective date of this
 23  5 division of the bill shall be governed by current law.
 23  6    The division provides for the confidentiality of certain
 23  7 information with regard to the tax credit.  The identity of
 23  8 a qualifying business, the identity of an investor and the
 23  9 qualifying business in which the investor made an equity
 23 10 investment, and the total number and amount of tax credits
 23 11 issued shall be considered public information under Code
 23 12 chapter 22 (examination of public records), but any other
 23 13 information or record in the possession of the EDA with respect
 23 14 to the program shall be presumed by the EDA to be a trade secret
 23 15 protected under Code chapter 550 or common law and shall be
 23 16 kept confidential by the EDA unless otherwise ordered by a
 23 17 court.
 23 18    The division takes effect upon enactment and applies to
 23 19 equity investments in a qualifying business made on or after
 23 20 that date.  Equity investments in a qualifying business or
 23 21 community=based seed capital fund made prior to the effective
 23 22 date of the division shall be governed by current law.
 23 23    DIVISION III ==== ENTREPRENEUR INVESTMENT AWARDS PROGRAM.
 23 24  Division III amends the entrepreneur investment awards program
 23 25 administered by the EDA.  The division strikes provisions that
 23 26 prohibited the EDA from making awards under the program since
 23 27 July 1, 2014, and that required the EDA by December 31, 2014,
 23 28 to conduct a comprehensive review of the program and submit
 23 29 a report with specified information to the governor and the
 23 30 general assembly.
 23 31    The division modifies the purpose of the program to be
 23 32 to provide financial assistance to eligible entrepreneurial
 23 33 assistance providers (provider) that provide technical and
 23 34 financial assistance to entrepreneurs and start=up companies
 23 35 seeking to create, locate, or expand a business in Iowa.
 24  1 "Financial assistance" is defined in the division.
 24  2    The division changes the requirements for receiving an
 24  3 award.  To be eligible to receive an award under current
 24  4 law, an entrepreneurial assistance program must have been
 24  5 an Iowa=based business, expended at least $500,000 during
 24  6 the previous fiscal year to provide technical and financial
 24  7 assistance services that meet the broad=based needs of
 24  8 entrepreneurs seeking to create, locate, or expand a business
 24  9 in Iowa that intends to derive more than 10 percent of its
 24 10 gross sales from markets outside Iowa; and must have engaged
 24 11 and communicated with certain other programs, funding sources,
 24 12 and entities for its entrepreneur clients.  The division
 24 13 amends the eligibility for receiving financial assistance to
 24 14 require that a provider have its principal place of operations
 24 15 in Iowa and that the provider offer a comprehensive set of
 24 16 business development services to emerging and early=stage
 24 17 innovation companies to assist in the creation, location,
 24 18 growth, and long=term success of the company in Iowa.
 24 19 "Business development services" is defined in the division.
 24 20 Business development services may be performed at the physical
 24 21 location of the provider or the company and may be provided in
 24 22 consideration of equity participation in the company, a fee for
 24 23 services, or a membership agreement with the company.
 24 24    Under current law, the EDA board could approve, deny, or
 24 25 defer each application for a grant, and was required to award
 24 26 grants on a first=come, first=served basis.  The division
 24 27 specifies that the EDA board has the discretion to approve,
 24 28 deny, or defer each application for financial assistance and
 24 29 that the amount of financial assistance awarded to a provider
 24 30 is within the discretion of the EDA.  The division requires
 24 31 the EDA to award financial assistance on a competitive basis
 24 32 and allows the EDA to develop scoring criteria and establish
 24 33 minimum requirements for the receipt of a financial assistance
 24 34 award.
 24 35    In addition to the four factors relating to the provider's
 25  1 professional staff that the EDA may consider under current
 25  2 law in deciding whether to award financial assistance, the
 25  3 division provides that the EDA may also consider the service
 25  4 model and likelihood of success of the provider, the provider's
 25  5 similarity to other successful providers in the country, and
 25  6 the provider's financial need.
 25  7    The division modifies the maximum award amount for a
 25  8 recipient.  Under current law, a grant to an entrepreneur
 25  9 assistance program cannot exceed the lesser of 25 percent of
 25 10 the funds expended by the program during the previous fiscal
 25 11 year, 100 percent of the funds raised from certain persons
 25 12 by the program during the previous fiscal year, or $200,000.
 25 13 The division provides that the amount of financial assistance
 25 14 awarded to any one provider shall not exceed $200,000.
 25 15    The division modifies the permitted use of funds received
 25 16 under the program.  Under current law, grants are only
 25 17 permitted to be used for the purpose of operating costs
 25 18 incurred by the program.  The division specifies that financial
 25 19 assistance awarded to a provider shall only be used for
 25 20 the purpose of operating costs incurred by the provider in
 25 21 the provision of business development services to emerging
 25 22 and early=stage innovation companies in Iowa.  The division
 25 23 further requires that such financial assistance shall not be
 25 24 distributed to owners or investors of the company to which the
 25 25 business development services are being provided and shall not
 25 26 be provided to other persons assisting with the provision of
 25 27 the services.
 25 28    Under current law, an entrepreneurial assistance provider is
 25 29 required to accept client referrals from the EDA as a condition
 25 30 of receiving a grant.  The division provides that the EDA may
 25 31 make client referrals to eligible providers.
 25 32    DIVISION IV ==== MISCELLANEOUS CHANGES.  Division IV makes
 25 33 several miscellaneous changes to other EDA programs.  The
 25 34 division amends the sales and use tax refund available under
 25 35 the workforce housing tax incentive program.  That refund
 26  1 is available for sales and use tax paid prior to project
 26  2 completion, which is currently defined to mean the first date
 26  3 upon which the average annualized production of finished
 26  4 product for the preceding 90=day period at the manufacturing
 26  5 facility operated by the eligible business is at least 50
 26  6 percent of the initial design capacity of the facility.  The
 26  7 division amends the definition of "project completion" to mean
 26  8 the date on which the EDA notifies the department of revenue
 26  9 that all applicable requirements of a workforce housing tax
 26 10 incentive program agreement are satisfied.  This provision
 26 11 takes effect upon enactment and applies retroactively to July
 26 12 1, 2014, for all workforce housing tax incentive agreements
 26 13 entered into on or after that date.
 26 14    The division allows the EDA to extend the project
 26 15 completion date for a project awarded tax incentives under the
 26 16 redevelopment tax credit program and the housing enterprise
 26 17 zone tax incentives program if the property that is the subject
 26 18 of the project suffered a catastrophic fire during the 2014
 26 19 calendar year.

 19 35 calendar year.  Renewable chemicals produced by an eligible
 20  1 business prior to the effective date of the division, or
 20  2 prior to the date the business first qualifies as an eligible
 20  3 business, or after calendar year 2025, shall not qualify for
 20  4 the tax credit.
 20  5    The tax credit shall be claimed for the tax year during
 20  6 which the eligible business was issued the tax credit.  The tax
 20  7 credit may be claimed against the individual income tax and the
 20  8 corporate income tax.  The credit is refundable or may, at the
 20  9 election of the taxpayer, be carried forward for up to one tax
 20 10 year.   The tax credit shall not be transferred to any person.  A
 20 11 tax credit issued to a partnership, limited liability company,
 20 12 S corporation, cooperative organized under Code chapter 501
 20 13 and filing as a partnership for federal tax purposes, estate,
 20 14 or trust electing to have the income taxed directly to the
 20 15 individual may be claimed by the individual based upon the pro
 20 16 rata share of the individual's earnings from that entity.
 20 17    The division provides that the program is subject to the
 20 18 EDA's maximum aggregate tax credit cap of $170 million per
 20 19 fiscal year in Code section 15.119, and not more than $15
 20 20 million per fiscal year may be issued by the EDA under the
 20 21 program.  In addition, the maximum amount of tax credit that
 20 22 may be issued to an eligible business in any one calendar year
 20 23 shall not exceed $1 million or $500,000, depending on whether
 20 24 the eligible business has been operating in Iowa at the time of
 20 25 application for five or fewer years, or more than five years,
 20 26 respectively.  An eligible business shall not receive more than
 20 27 five tax credits under the program.  The EDA is required to
 20 28 issue tax credits on a first=come, first=served basis until the
 20 29 maximum amount of $15 million per fiscal year is reached.  If
 20 30 the amount of tax credits exceeds this amount in a fiscal year,
 20 31 the EDA is required to establish a wait list and give priority
 20 32 in subsequent years to the eligible businesses on the wait
 20 33 list.
 20 34    The division provides for the confidentiality of certain
 20 35 information under the program.  The identity of a tax credit
 21  1 recipient and the amount of the tax credit shall be considered
 21  2 public information under Code chapter 22 (examination of public
 21  3 records), but any other information or record in the possession
 21  4 of the EDA with respect to the program shall be presumed by
 21  5 the EDA to be a trade secret protected under Code chapter 550
 21  6 or common law and shall be kept confidential by the EDA unless
 21  7 otherwise ordered by a court.
 21  8    The division takes effect upon enactment and applies to
 21  9 renewable chemicals produced in Iowa from biomass feedstock on
 21 10 or after that date.  The division applies retroactively to tax
 21 11 years beginning on or after January 1, 2015.
 21 12    DIVISION II ==== ANGEL INVESTOR TAX CREDITS.   Division II
 21 13 makes several changes to the tax credit for investments in
 21 14 qualifying businesses and community=based seed capital funds,
 21 15 often referred to as the angel investor tax credits.  The
 21 16 division amends the purpose of the tax credit in Code section
 21 17 15E.41.  The division excludes investments in community=based
 21 18 seed capital funds from qualifying for the tax credit and
 21 19 makes several conforming amendments to remove references to
 21 20 community=based seed capital funds from the Code.
 21 21    The division modifies the amount and dollar limitation of
 21 22 the tax credit for a taxpayer.  The tax credit is increased
 21 23 from 20 percent to 25 percent of a taxpayer's equity investment
 21 24 in a qualifying business.  Under current law, a taxpayer cannot
 21 25 claim more than $50,000 of tax credit per investment in a
 21 26 qualifying business, and for each tax year a taxpayer and the
 21 27 taxpayer's affiliates cannot claim tax credits for more than
 21 28 five investments in five different qualifying businesses.  The
 21 29 division amends this dollar limitation to prohibit a natural
 21 30 person and the person's spouse, child, or sibling from claiming
 21 31 a combined amount of more than $100,000 in tax credits per tax
 21 32 year.
 21 33    The division also provides that no more than $500,000 in tax
 21 34 credits may be issued per tax year for equity investments in
 21 35 any one qualifying business.
 22  1 The division modifies the procedures for claiming the tax
 22  2 credit.  Under current law, the tax credit is not refundable
 22  3 but available for carryforward for up to five tax years.  The
 22  4 division makes the tax credit refundable for an investment
 22  5 made by a natural person, and for any other person reduces the
 22  6 carryforward period to three years.
 22  7    The division strikes a provision permitting the EDA
 22  8 to cooperate with small business development centers to
 22  9 disseminate information regarding the credits and to develop
 22 10 standard application forms, and requiring the EDA to distribute
 22 11 copies of the application forms to all community=based seed
 22 12 capital funds and potential individual investors.
 22 13    The division modifies the eligibility requirements for
 22 14 qualifying businesses.  The division strikes the requirement
 22 15 that a business have an owner that meets at least one of
 22 16 four qualifications relating to business education or
 22 17 business experience.  The division requires that a business
 22 18 be participating in an entrepreneurial assistance program,
 22 19 as defined in the division, but allows the EDA to waive this
 22 20 requirement if the business establishes that its owners,
 22 21 directors, officers, and employees have an appropriate level
 22 22 of experience such that an entrepreneurial assistance program
 22 23 would not materially change the prospects of the business.
 22 24 The EDA is allowed to consult with outside service providers
 22 25 in considering such a waiver.  The division increases from $5
 22 26 million to $10 million the maximum amount of net worth that
 22 27 a business may have to be considered a qualifying business.
 22 28 The division increases from $250,000 to $500,000 the amount of
 22 29 financing that a business must have in order to be considered a
 22 30 qualifying business, removes "near equity" from the types of
 22 31 financing that will be considered in that calculation, requires
 22 32 that the financing be secured at the time of application for
 22 33 the tax credits, and requires that the business have at least
 22 34 two investors at the time of application for the tax credits.
 22 35 These modified eligibility requirements apply to businesses
 23  1 that submit an application to the EDA to be registered as a
 23  2 qualifying business on or after the effective date of this
 23  3 division of the bill, and businesses that submitted such an
 23  4 application to the EDA before the effective date of this
 23  5 division of the bill shall be governed by current law.
 23  6    The division provides for the confidentiality of certain
 23  7 information with regard to the tax credit.  The identity of
 23  8 a qualifying business, the identity of an investor and the
 23  9 qualifying business in which the investor made an equity
 23 10 investment, and the total number and amount of tax credits
 23 11 issued shall be considered public information under Code
 23 12 chapter 22 (examination of public records), but any other
 23 13 information or record in the possession of the EDA with respect
 23 14 to the program shall be presumed by the EDA to be a trade secret
 23 15 protected under Code chapter 550 or common law and shall be
 23 16 kept confidential by the EDA unless otherwise ordered by a
 23 17 court.
 23 18    The division takes effect upon enactment and applies to
 23 19 equity investments in a qualifying business made on or after
 23 20 that date.  Equity investments in a qualifying business or
 23 21 community=based seed capital fund made prior to the effective
 23 22 date of the division shall be governed by current law.
 23 23    DIVISION III ==== ENTREPRENEUR INVESTMENT AWARDS PROGRAM.
 23 24  Division III amends the entrepreneur investment awards program
 23 25 administered by the EDA.  The division strikes provisions that
 23 26 prohibited the EDA from making awards under the program since
 23 27 July 1, 2014, and that required the EDA by December 31, 2014,
 23 28 to conduct a comprehensive review of the program and submit
 23 29 a report with specified information to the governor and the
 23 30 general assembly.
 23 31    The division modifies the purpose of the program to be
 23 32 to provide financial assistance to eligible entrepreneurial
 23 33 assistance providers (provider) that provide technical and
 23 34 financial assistance to entrepreneurs and start=up companies
 23 35 seeking to create, locate, or expand a business in Iowa.
 24  1 "Financial assistance" is defined in the division.
 24  2    The division changes the requirements for receiving an
 24  3 award.  To be eligible to receive an award under current
 24  4 law, an entrepreneurial assistance program must have been
 24  5 an Iowa=based business, expended at least $500,000 during
 24  6 the previous fiscal year to provide technical and financial
 24  7 assistance services that meet the broad=based needs of
 24  8 entrepreneurs seeking to create, locate, or expand a business
 24  9 in Iowa that intends to derive more than 10 percent of its
 24 10 gross sales from markets outside Iowa; and must have engaged
 24 11 and communicated with certain other programs, funding sources,
 24 12 and entities for its entrepreneur clients.  The division
 24 13 amends the eligibility for receiving financial assistance to
 24 14 require that a provider have its principal place of operations
 24 15 in Iowa and that the provider offer a comprehensive set of
 24 16 business development services to emerging and early=stage
 24 17 innovation companies to assist in the creation, location,
 24 18 growth, and long=term success of the company in Iowa.
 24 19 "Business development services" is defined in the division.
 24 20 Business development services may be performed at the physical
 24 21 location of the provider or the company and may be provided in
 24 22 consideration of equity participation in the company, a fee for
 24 23 services, or a membership agreement with the company.
 24 24    Under current law, the EDA board could approve, deny, or
 24 25 defer each application for a grant, and was required to award
 24 26 grants on a first=come, first=served basis.  The division
 24 27 specifies that the EDA board has the discretion to approve,
 24 28 deny, or defer each application for financial assistance and
 24 29 that the amount of financial assistance awarded to a provider
 24 30 is within the discretion of the EDA.  The division requires
 24 31 the EDA to award financial assistance on a competitive basis
 24 32 and allows the EDA to develop scoring criteria and establish
 24 33 minimum requirements for the receipt of a financial assistance
 24 34 award.
 24 35    In addition to the four factors relating to the provider's
 25  1 professional staff that the EDA may consider under current
 25  2 law in deciding whether to award financial assistance, the
 25  3 division provides that the EDA may also consider the service
 25  4 model and likelihood of success of the provider, the provider's
 25  5 similarity to other successful providers in the country, and
 25  6 the provider's financial need.
 25  7    The division modifies the maximum award amount for a
 25  8 recipient.  Under current law, a grant to an entrepreneur
 25  9 assistance program cannot exceed the lesser of 25 percent of
 25 10 the funds expended by the program during the previous fiscal
 25 11 year, 100 percent of the funds raised from certain persons
 25 12 by the program during the previous fiscal year, or $200,000.
 25 13 The division provides that the amount of financial assistance
 25 14 awarded to any one provider shall not exceed $200,000.
 25 15    The division modifies the permitted use of funds received
 25 16 under the program.  Under current law, grants are only
 25 17 permitted to be used for the purpose of operating costs
 25 18 incurred by the program.  The division specifies that financial
 25 19 assistance awarded to a provider shall only be used for
 25 20 the purpose of operating costs incurred by the provider in
 25 21 the provision of business development services to emerging
 25 22 and early=stage innovation companies in Iowa.  The division
 25 23 further requires that such financial assistance shall not be
 25 24 distributed to owners or investors of the company to which the
 25 25 business development services are being provided and shall not
 25 26 be provided to other persons assisting with the provision of
 25 27 the services.
 25 28    Under current law, an entrepreneurial assistance provider is
 25 29 required to accept client referrals from the EDA as a condition
 25 30 of receiving a grant.  The division provides that the EDA may
 25 31 make client referrals to eligible providers.
 25 32    DIVISION IV ==== MISCELLANEOUS CHANGES.  Division IV makes
 25 33 several miscellaneous changes to other EDA programs.  The
 25 34 division amends the sales and use tax refund available under
 25 35 the workforce housing tax incentive program.  That refund
 26  1 is available for sales and use tax paid prior to project
 26  2 completion, which is currently defined to mean the first date
 26  3 upon which the average annualized production of finished
 26  4 product for the preceding 90=day period at the manufacturing
 26  5 facility operated by the eligible business is at least 50
 26  6 percent of the initial design capacity of the facility.  The
 26  7 division amends the definition of "project completion" to mean
 26  8 the date on which the EDA notifies the department of revenue
 26  9 that all applicable requirements of a workforce housing tax
 26 10 incentive program agreement are satisfied.  This provision
 26 11 takes effect upon enactment and applies retroactively to July
 26 12 1, 2014, for all workforce housing tax incentive agreements
 26 13 entered into on or after that date.
 26 14    The division allows the EDA to extend the project
 26 15 completion date for a project awarded tax incentives under the
 26 16 redevelopment tax credit program and the housing enterprise
 26 17 zone tax incentives program if the property that is the subject
 26 18 of the project suffered a catastrophic fire during the 2014
 26 19 calendar year.
       LSB 1212HV (3) 86
       mm/sc
 20  1 business prior to the effective date of the division, or
 20  2 prior to the date the business first qualifies as an eligible
 20  3 business, or after calendar year 2025, shall not qualify for
 20  4 the tax credit.
 20  5    The tax credit shall be claimed for the tax year during
 20  6 which the eligible business was issued the tax credit.  The tax
 20  7 credit may be claimed against the individual income tax and the
 20  8 corporate income tax.  The credit is refundable or may, at the
 20  9 election of the taxpayer, be carried forward for up to one tax
 20 10 year.   The tax credit shall not be transferred to any person.  A
 20 11 tax credit issued to a partnership, limited liability company,
 20 12 S corporation, cooperative organized under Code chapter 501
 20 13 and filing as a partnership for federal tax purposes, estate,
 20 14 or trust electing to have the income taxed directly to the
 20 15 individual may be claimed by the individual based upon the pro
 20 16 rata share of the individual's earnings from that entity.
 20 17    The division provides that the program is subject to the
 20 18 EDA's maximum aggregate tax credit cap of $170 million per
 20 19 fiscal year in Code section 15.119, and not more than $15
 20 20 million per fiscal year may be issued by the EDA under the
 20 21 program.  In addition, the maximum amount of tax credit that
 20 22 may be issued to an eligible business in any one calendar year
 20 23 shall not exceed $1 million or $500,000, depending on whether
 20 24 the eligible business has been operating in Iowa at the time of
 20 25 application for five or fewer years, or more than five years,
 20 26 respectively.  An eligible business shall not receive more than
 20 27 five tax credits under the program.  The EDA is required to
 20 28 issue tax credits on a first=come, first=served basis until the
 20 29 maximum amount of $15 million per fiscal year is reached.  If
 20 30 the amount of tax credits exceeds this amount in a fiscal year,
 20 31 the EDA is required to establish a wait list and give priority
 20 32 in subsequent years to the eligible businesses on the wait
 20 33 list.
 20 34    The division provides for the confidentiality of certain
 20 35 information under the program.  The identity of a tax credit
 21  1 recipient and the amount of the tax credit shall be considered
 21  2 public information under Code chapter 22 (examination of public
 21  3 records), but any other information or record in the possession
 21  4 of the EDA with respect to the program shall be presumed by
 21  5 the EDA to be a trade secret protected under Code chapter 550
 21  6 or common law and shall be kept confidential by the EDA unless
 21  7 otherwise ordered by a court.
 21  8    The division takes effect upon enactment and applies to
 21  9 renewable chemicals produced in Iowa from biomass feedstock on
 21 10 or after that date.  The division applies retroactively to tax
 21 11 years beginning on or after January 1, 2015.
 21 12    DIVISION II ==== ANGEL INVESTOR TAX CREDITS.   Division II
 21 13 makes several changes to the tax credit for investments in
 21 14 qualifying businesses and community=based seed capital funds,
 21 15 often referred to as the angel investor tax credits.  The
 21 16 division amends the purpose of the tax credit in Code section
 21 17 15E.41.  The division excludes investments in community=based
 21 18 seed capital funds from qualifying for the tax credit and
 21 19 makes several conforming amendments to remove references to
 21 20 community=based seed capital funds from the Code.
 21 21    The division modifies the amount and dollar limitation of
 21 22 the tax credit for a taxpayer.  The tax credit is increased
 21 23 from 20 percent to 25 percent of a taxpayer's equity investment
 21 24 in a qualifying business.  Under current law, a taxpayer cannot
 21 25 claim more than $50,000 of tax credit per investment in a
 21 26 qualifying business, and for each tax year a taxpayer and the
 21 27 taxpayer's affiliates cannot claim tax credits for more than
 21 28 five investments in five different qualifying businesses.  The
 21 29 division amends this dollar limitation to prohibit a natural
 21 30 person and the person's spouse, child, or sibling from claiming
 21 31 a combined amount of more than $100,000 in tax credits per tax
 21 32 year.
 21 33    The division also provides that no more than $500,000 in tax
 21 34 credits may be issued per tax year for equity investments in
 21 35 any one qualifying business.
 22  1 The division modifies the procedures for claiming the tax
 22  2 credit.  Under current law, the tax credit is not refundable
 22  3 but available for carryforward for up to five tax years.  The
 22  4 division makes the tax credit refundable for an investment
 22  5 made by a natural person, and for any other person reduces the
 22  6 carryforward period to three years.
 22  7    The division strikes a provision permitting the EDA
 22  8 to cooperate with small business development centers to
 22  9 disseminate information regarding the credits and to develop
 22 10 standard application forms, and requiring the EDA to distribute
 22 11 copies of the application forms to all community=based seed
 22 12 capital funds and potential individual investors.
 22 13    The division modifies the eligibility requirements for
 22 14 qualifying businesses.  The division strikes the requirement
 22 15 that a business have an owner that meets at least one of
 22 16 four qualifications relating to business education or
 22 17 business experience.  The division requires that a business
 22 18 be participating in an entrepreneurial assistance program,
 22 19 as defined in the division, but allows the EDA to waive this
 22 20 requirement if the business establishes that its owners,
 22 21 directors, officers, and employees have an appropriate level
 22 22 of experience such that an entrepreneurial assistance program
 22 23 would not materially change the prospects of the business.
 22 24 The EDA is allowed to consult with outside service providers
 22 25 in considering such a waiver.  The division increases from $5
 22 26 million to $10 million the maximum amount of net worth that
 22 27 a business may have to be considered a qualifying business.
 22 28 The division increases from $250,000 to $500,000 the amount of
 22 29 financing that a business must have in order to be considered a
 22 30 qualifying business, removes "near equity" from the types of
 22 31 financing that will be considered in that calculation, requires
 22 32 that the financing be secured at the time of application for
 22 33 the tax credits, and requires that the business have at least
 22 34 two investors at the time of application for the tax credits.
 22 35 These modified eligibility requirements apply to businesses
 23  1 that submit an application to the EDA to be registered as a
 23  2 qualifying business on or after the effective date of this
 23  3 division of the bill, and businesses that submitted such an
 23  4 application to the EDA before the effective date of this
 23  5 division of the bill shall be governed by current law.
 23  6    The division provides for the confidentiality of certain
 23  7 information with regard to the tax credit.  The identity of
 23  8 a qualifying business, the identity of an investor and the
 23  9 qualifying business in which the investor made an equity
 23 10 investment, and the total number and amount of tax credits
 23 11 issued shall be considered public information under Code
 23 12 chapter 22 (examination of public records), but any other
 23 13 information or record in the possession of the EDA with respect
 23 14 to the program shall be presumed by the EDA to be a trade secret
 23 15 protected under Code chapter 550 or common law and shall be
 23 16 kept confidential by the EDA unless otherwise ordered by a
 23 17 court.
 23 18    The division takes effect upon enactment and applies to
 23 19 equity investments in a qualifying business made on or after
 23 20 that date.  Equity investments in a qualifying business or
 23 21 community=based seed capital fund made prior to the effective
 23 22 date of the division shall be governed by current law.
 23 23    DIVISION III ==== ENTREPRENEUR INVESTMENT AWARDS PROGRAM.
 23 24  Division III amends the entrepreneur investment awards program
 23 25 administered by the EDA.  The division strikes provisions that
 23 26 prohibited the EDA from making awards under the program since
 23 27 July 1, 2014, and that required the EDA by December 31, 2014,
 23 28 to conduct a comprehensive review of the program and submit
 23 29 a report with specified information to the governor and the
 23 30 general assembly.
 23 31    The division modifies the purpose of the program to be
 23 32 to provide financial assistance to eligible entrepreneurial
 23 33 assistance providers (provider) that provide technical and
 23 34 financial assistance to entrepreneurs and start=up companies
 23 35 seeking to create, locate, or expand a business in Iowa.
 24  1 "Financial assistance" is defined in the division.
 24  2    The division changes the requirements for receiving an
 24  3 award.  To be eligible to receive an award under current
 24  4 law, an entrepreneurial assistance program must have been
 24  5 an Iowa=based business, expended at least $500,000 during
 24  6 the previous fiscal year to provide technical and financial
 24  7 assistance services that meet the broad=based needs of
 24  8 entrepreneurs seeking to create, locate, or expand a business
 24  9 in Iowa that intends to derive more than 10 percent of its
 24 10 gross sales from markets outside Iowa; and must have engaged
 24 11 and communicated with certain other programs, funding sources,
 24 12 and entities for its entrepreneur clients.  The division
 24 13 amends the eligibility for receiving financial assistance to
 24 14 require that a provider have its principal place of operations
 24 15 in Iowa and that the provider offer a comprehensive set of
 24 16 business development services to emerging and early=stage
 24 17 innovation companies to assist in the creation, location,
 24 18 growth, and long=term success of the company in Iowa.
 24 19 "Business development services" is defined in the division.
 24 20 Business development services may be performed at the physical
 24 21 location of the provider or the company and may be provided in
 24 22 consideration of equity participation in the company, a fee for
 24 23 services, or a membership agreement with the company.
 24 24    Under current law, the EDA board could approve, deny, or
 24 25 defer each application for a grant, and was required to award
 24 26 grants on a first=come, first=served basis.  The division
 24 27 specifies that the EDA board has the discretion to approve,
 24 28 deny, or defer each application for financial assistance and
 24 29 that the amount of financial assistance awarded to a provider
 24 30 is within the discretion of the EDA.  The division requires
 24 31 the EDA to award financial assistance on a competitive basis
 24 32 and allows the EDA to develop scoring criteria and establish
 24 33 minimum requirements for the receipt of a financial assistance
 24 34 award.
 24 35    In addition to the four factors relating to the provider's
 25  1 professional staff that the EDA may consider under current
 25  2 law in deciding whether to award financial assistance, the
 25  3 division provides that the EDA may also consider the service
 25  4 model and likelihood of success of the provider, the provider's
 25  5 similarity to other successful providers in the country, and
 25  6 the provider's financial need.
 25  7    The division modifies the maximum award amount for a
 25  8 recipient.  Under current law, a grant to an entrepreneur
 25  9 assistance program cannot exceed the lesser of 25 percent of
 25 10 the funds expended by the program during the previous fiscal
 25 11 year, 100 percent of the funds raised from certain persons
 25 12 by the program during the previous fiscal year, or $200,000.
 25 13 The division provides that the amount of financial assistance
 25 14 awarded to any one provider shall not exceed $200,000.
 25 15    The division modifies the permitted use of funds received
 25 16 under the program.  Under current law, grants are only
 25 17 permitted to be used for the purpose of operating costs
 25 18 incurred by the program.  The division specifies that financial
 25 19 assistance awarded to a provider shall only be used for
 25 20 the purpose of operating costs incurred by the provider in
 25 21 the provision of business development services to emerging
 25 22 and early=stage innovation companies in Iowa.  The division
 25 23 further requires that such financial assistance shall not be
 25 24 distributed to owners or investors of the company to which the
 25 25 business development services are being provided and shall not
 25 26 be provided to other persons assisting with the provision of
 25 27 the services.
 25 28    Under current law, an entrepreneurial assistance provider is
 25 29 required to accept client referrals from the EDA as a condition
 25 30 of receiving a grant.  The division provides that the EDA may
 25 31 make client referrals to eligible providers.
 25 32    DIVISION IV ==== MISCELLANEOUS CHANGES.  Division IV makes
 25 33 several miscellaneous changes to other EDA programs.  The
 25 34 division amends the sales and use tax refund available under
 25 35 the workforce housing tax incentive program.  That refund
 26  1 is available for sales and use tax paid prior to project
 26  2 completion, which is currently defined to mean the first date
 26  3 upon which the average annualized production of finished
 26  4 product for the preceding 90=day period at the manufacturing
 26  5 facility operated by the eligible business is at least 50
 26  6 percent of the initial design capacity of the facility.  The
 26  7 division amends the definition of "project completion" to mean
 26  8 the date on which the EDA notifies the department of revenue
 26  9 that all applicable requirements of a workforce housing tax
 26 10 incentive program agreement are satisfied.  This provision
 26 11 takes effect upon enactment and applies retroactively to July
 26 12 1, 2014, for all workforce housing tax incentive agreements
 26 13 entered into on or after that date.
 26 14    The division allows the EDA to extend the project
 26 15 completion date for a project awarded tax incentives under the
 26 16 redevelopment tax credit program and the housing enterprise
 26 17 zone tax incentives program if the property that is the subject
 26 18 of the project suffered a catastrophic fire during the 2014
 26 19 calendar year.

       mm/sc
 20  2 prior to the date the business first qualifies as an eligible
 20  3 business, or after calendar year 2025, shall not qualify for
 20  4 the tax credit.
 20  5    The tax credit shall be claimed for the tax year during
 20  6 which the eligible business was issued the tax credit.  The tax
 20  7 credit may be claimed against the individual income tax and the
 20  8 corporate income tax.  The credit is refundable or may, at the
 20  9 election of the taxpayer, be carried forward for up to one tax
 20 10 year.   The tax credit shall not be transferred to any person.  A
 20 11 tax credit issued to a partnership, limited liability company,
 20 12 S corporation, cooperative organized under Code chapter 501
 20 13 and filing as a partnership for federal tax purposes, estate,
 20 14 or trust electing to have the income taxed directly to the
 20 15 individual may be claimed by the individual based upon the pro
 20 16 rata share of the individual's earnings from that entity.
 20 17    The division provides that the program is subject to the
 20 18 EDA's maximum aggregate tax credit cap of $170 million per
 20 19 fiscal year in Code section 15.119, and not more than $15
 20 20 million per fiscal year may be issued by the EDA under the
 20 21 program.  In addition, the maximum amount of tax credit that
 20 22 may be issued to an eligible business in any one calendar year
 20 23 shall not exceed $1 million or $500,000, depending on whether
 20 24 the eligible business has been operating in Iowa at the time of
 20 25 application for five or fewer years, or more than five years,
 20 26 respectively.  An eligible business shall not receive more than
 20 27 five tax credits under the program.  The EDA is required to
 20 28 issue tax credits on a first=come, first=served basis until the
 20 29 maximum amount of $15 million per fiscal year is reached.  If
 20 30 the amount of tax credits exceeds this amount in a fiscal year,
 20 31 the EDA is required to establish a wait list and give priority
 20 32 in subsequent years to the eligible businesses on the wait
 20 33 list.
 20 34    The division provides for the confidentiality of certain
 20 35 information under the program.  The identity of a tax credit
 21  1 recipient and the amount of the tax credit shall be considered
 21  2 public information under Code chapter 22 (examination of public
 21  3 records), but any other information or record in the possession
 21  4 of the EDA with respect to the program shall be presumed by
 21  5 the EDA to be a trade secret protected under Code chapter 550
 21  6 or common law and shall be kept confidential by the EDA unless
 21  7 otherwise ordered by a court.
 21  8    The division takes effect upon enactment and applies to
 21  9 renewable chemicals produced in Iowa from biomass feedstock on
 21 10 or after that date.  The division applies retroactively to tax
 21 11 years beginning on or after January 1, 2015.
 21 12    DIVISION II ==== ANGEL INVESTOR TAX CREDITS.   Division II
 21 13 makes several changes to the tax credit for investments in
 21 14 qualifying businesses and community=based seed capital funds,
 21 15 often referred to as the angel investor tax credits.  The
 21 16 division amends the purpose of the tax credit in Code section
 21 17 15E.41.  The division excludes investments in community=based
 21 18 seed capital funds from qualifying for the tax credit and
 21 19 makes several conforming amendments to remove references to
 21 20 community=based seed capital funds from the Code.
 21 21    The division modifies the amount and dollar limitation of
 21 22 the tax credit for a taxpayer.  The tax credit is increased
 21 23 from 20 percent to 25 percent of a taxpayer's equity investment
 21 24 in a qualifying business.  Under current law, a taxpayer cannot
 21 25 claim more than $50,000 of tax credit per investment in a
 21 26 qualifying business, and for each tax year a taxpayer and the
 21 27 taxpayer's affiliates cannot claim tax credits for more than
 21 28 five investments in five different qualifying businesses.  The
 21 29 division amends this dollar limitation to prohibit a natural
 21 30 person and the person's spouse, child, or sibling from claiming
 21 31 a combined amount of more than $100,000 in tax credits per tax
 21 32 year.
 21 33    The division also provides that no more than $500,000 in tax
 21 34 credits may be issued per tax year for equity investments in
 21 35 any one qualifying business.
 22  1 The division modifies the procedures for claiming the tax
 22  2 credit.  Under current law, the tax credit is not refundable
 22  3 but available for carryforward for up to five tax years.  The
 22  4 division makes the tax credit refundable for an investment
 22  5 made by a natural person, and for any other person reduces the
 22  6 carryforward period to three years.
 22  7    The division strikes a provision permitting the EDA
 22  8 to cooperate with small business development centers to
 22  9 disseminate information regarding the credits and to develop
 22 10 standard application forms, and requiring the EDA to distribute
 22 11 copies of the application forms to all community=based seed
 22 12 capital funds and potential individual investors.
 22 13    The division modifies the eligibility requirements for
 22 14 qualifying businesses.  The division strikes the requirement
 22 15 that a business have an owner that meets at least one of
 22 16 four qualifications relating to business education or
 22 17 business experience.  The division requires that a business
 22 18 be participating in an entrepreneurial assistance program,
 22 19 as defined in the division, but allows the EDA to waive this
 22 20 requirement if the business establishes that its owners,
 22 21 directors, officers, and employees have an appropriate level
 22 22 of experience such that an entrepreneurial assistance program
 22 23 would not materially change the prospects of the business.
 22 24 The EDA is allowed to consult with outside service providers
 22 25 in considering such a waiver.  The division increases from $5
 22 26 million to $10 million the maximum amount of net worth that
 22 27 a business may have to be considered a qualifying business.
 22 28 The division increases from $250,000 to $500,000 the amount of
 22 29 financing that a business must have in order to be considered a
 22 30 qualifying business, removes "near equity" from the types of
 22 31 financing that will be considered in that calculation, requires
 22 32 that the financing be secured at the time of application for
 22 33 the tax credits, and requires that the business have at least
 22 34 two investors at the time of application for the tax credits.
 22 35 These modified eligibility requirements apply to businesses
 23  1 that submit an application to the EDA to be registered as a
 23  2 qualifying business on or after the effective date of this
 23  3 division of the bill, and businesses that submitted such an
 23  4 application to the EDA before the effective date of this
 23  5 division of the bill shall be governed by current law.
 23  6    The division provides for the confidentiality of certain
 23  7 information with regard to the tax credit.  The identity of
 23  8 a qualifying business, the identity of an investor and the
 23  9 qualifying business in which the investor made an equity
 23 10 investment, and the total number and amount of tax credits
 23 11 issued shall be considered public information under Code
 23 12 chapter 22 (examination of public records), but any other
 23 13 information or record in the possession of the EDA with respect
 23 14 to the program shall be presumed by the EDA to be a trade secret
 23 15 protected under Code chapter 550 or common law and shall be
 23 16 kept confidential by the EDA unless otherwise ordered by a
 23 17 court.
 23 18    The division takes effect upon enactment and applies to
 23 19 equity investments in a qualifying business made on or after
 23 20 that date.  Equity investments in a qualifying business or
 23 21 community=based seed capital fund made prior to the effective
 23 22 date of the division shall be governed by current law.
 23 23    DIVISION III ==== ENTREPRENEUR INVESTMENT AWARDS PROGRAM.
 23 24  Division III amends the entrepreneur investment awards program
 23 25 administered by the EDA.  The division strikes provisions that
 23 26 prohibited the EDA from making awards under the program since
 23 27 July 1, 2014, and that required the EDA by December 31, 2014,
 23 28 to conduct a comprehensive review of the program and submit
 23 29 a report with specified information to the governor and the
 23 30 general assembly.
 23 31    The division modifies the purpose of the program to be
 23 32 to provide financial assistance to eligible entrepreneurial
 23 33 assistance providers (provider) that provide technical and
 23 34 financial assistance to entrepreneurs and start=up companies
 23 35 seeking to create, locate, or expand a business in Iowa.
 24  1 "Financial assistance" is defined in the division.
 24  2    The division changes the requirements for receiving an
 24  3 award.  To be eligible to receive an award under current
 24  4 law, an entrepreneurial assistance program must have been
 24  5 an Iowa=based business, expended at least $500,000 during
 24  6 the previous fiscal year to provide technical and financial
 24  7 assistance services that meet the broad=based needs of
 24  8 entrepreneurs seeking to create, locate, or expand a business
 24  9 in Iowa that intends to derive more than 10 percent of its
 24 10 gross sales from markets outside Iowa; and must have engaged
 24 11 and communicated with certain other programs, funding sources,
 24 12 and entities for its entrepreneur clients.  The division
 24 13 amends the eligibility for receiving financial assistance to
 24 14 require that a provider have its principal place of operations
 24 15 in Iowa and that the provider offer a comprehensive set of
 24 16 business development services to emerging and early=stage
 24 17 innovation companies to assist in the creation, location,
 24 18 growth, and long=term success of the company in Iowa.
 24 19 "Business development services" is defined in the division.
 24 20 Business development services may be performed at the physical
 24 21 location of the provider or the company and may be provided in
 24 22 consideration of equity participation in the company, a fee for
 24 23 services, or a membership agreement with the company.
 24 24    Under current law, the EDA board could approve, deny, or
 24 25 defer each application for a grant, and was required to award
 24 26 grants on a first=come, first=served basis.  The division
 24 27 specifies that the EDA board has the discretion to approve,
 24 28 deny, or defer each application for financial assistance and
 24 29 that the amount of financial assistance awarded to a provider
 24 30 is within the discretion of the EDA.  The division requires
 24 31 the EDA to award financial assistance on a competitive basis
 24 32 and allows the EDA to develop scoring criteria and establish
 24 33 minimum requirements for the receipt of a financial assistance
 24 34 award.
 24 35    In addition to the four factors relating to the provider's
 25  1 professional staff that the EDA may consider under current
 25  2 law in deciding whether to award financial assistance, the
 25  3 division provides that the EDA may also consider the service
 25  4 model and likelihood of success of the provider, the provider's
 25  5 similarity to other successful providers in the country, and
 25  6 the provider's financial need.
 25  7    The division modifies the maximum award amount for a
 25  8 recipient.  Under current law, a grant to an entrepreneur
 25  9 assistance program cannot exceed the lesser of 25 percent of
 25 10 the funds expended by the program during the previous fiscal
 25 11 year, 100 percent of the funds raised from certain persons
 25 12 by the program during the previous fiscal year, or $200,000.
 25 13 The division provides that the amount of financial assistance
 25 14 awarded to any one provider shall not exceed $200,000.
 25 15    The division modifies the permitted use of funds received
 25 16 under the program.  Under current law, grants are only
 25 17 permitted to be used for the purpose of operating costs
 25 18 incurred by the program.  The division specifies that financial
 25 19 assistance awarded to a provider shall only be used for
 25 20 the purpose of operating costs incurred by the provider in
 25 21 the provision of business development services to emerging
 25 22 and early=stage innovation companies in Iowa.  The division
 25 23 further requires that such financial assistance shall not be
 25 24 distributed to owners or investors of the company to which the
 25 25 business development services are being provided and shall not
 25 26 be provided to other persons assisting with the provision of
 25 27 the services.
 25 28    Under current law, an entrepreneurial assistance provider is
 25 29 required to accept client referrals from the EDA as a condition
 25 30 of receiving a grant.  The division provides that the EDA may
 25 31 make client referrals to eligible providers.
 25 32    DIVISION IV ==== MISCELLANEOUS CHANGES.  Division IV makes
 25 33 several miscellaneous changes to other EDA programs.  The
 25 34 division amends the sales and use tax refund available under
 25 35 the workforce housing tax incentive program.  That refund
 26  1 is available for sales and use tax paid prior to project
 26  2 completion, which is currently defined to mean the first date
 26  3 upon which the average annualized production of finished
 26  4 product for the preceding 90=day period at the manufacturing
 26  5 facility operated by the eligible business is at least 50
 26  6 percent of the initial design capacity of the facility.  The
 26  7 division amends the definition of "project completion" to mean
 26  8 the date on which the EDA notifies the department of revenue
 26  9 that all applicable requirements of a workforce housing tax
 26 10 incentive program agreement are satisfied.  This provision
 26 11 takes effect upon enactment and applies retroactively to July
 26 12 1, 2014, for all workforce housing tax incentive agreements
 26 13 entered into on or after that date.
 26 14    The division allows the EDA to extend the project
 26 15 completion date for a project awarded tax incentives under the
 26 16 redevelopment tax credit program and the housing enterprise
 26 17 zone tax incentives program if the property that is the subject
 26 18 of the project suffered a catastrophic fire during the 2014
 26 19 calendar year.
       LSB 1212HV (3) 86
       mm/sc
 20  3 business, or after calendar year 2025, shall not qualify for
 20  4 the tax credit.
 20  5    The tax credit shall be claimed for the tax year during
 20  6 which the eligible business was issued the tax credit.  The tax
 20  7 credit may be claimed against the individual income tax and the
 20  8 corporate income tax.  The credit is refundable or may, at the
 20  9 election of the taxpayer, be carried forward for up to one tax
 20 10 year.   The tax credit shall not be transferred to any person.  A
 20 11 tax credit issued to a partnership, limited liability company,
 20 12 S corporation, cooperative organized under Code chapter 501
 20 13 and filing as a partnership for federal tax purposes, estate,
 20 14 or trust electing to have the income taxed directly to the
 20 15 individual may be claimed by the individual based upon the pro
 20 16 rata share of the individual's earnings from that entity.
 20 17    The division provides that the program is subject to the
 20 18 EDA's maximum aggregate tax credit cap of $170 million per
 20 19 fiscal year in Code section 15.119, and not more than $15
 20 20 million per fiscal year may be issued by the EDA under the
 20 21 program.  In addition, the maximum amount of tax credit that
 20 22 may be issued to an eligible business in any one calendar year
 20 23 shall not exceed $1 million or $500,000, depending on whether
 20 24 the eligible business has been operating in Iowa at the time of
 20 25 application for five or fewer years, or more than five years,
 20 26 respectively.  An eligible business shall not receive more than
 20 27 five tax credits under the program.  The EDA is required to
 20 28 issue tax credits on a first=come, first=served basis until the
 20 29 maximum amount of $15 million per fiscal year is reached.  If
 20 30 the amount of tax credits exceeds this amount in a fiscal year,
 20 31 the EDA is required to establish a wait list and give priority
 20 32 in subsequent years to the eligible businesses on the wait
 20 33 list.
 20 34    The division provides for the confidentiality of certain
 20 35 information under the program.  The identity of a tax credit
 21  1 recipient and the amount of the tax credit shall be considered
 21  2 public information under Code chapter 22 (examination of public
 21  3 records), but any other information or record in the possession
 21  4 of the EDA with respect to the program shall be presumed by
 21  5 the EDA to be a trade secret protected under Code chapter 550
 21  6 or common law and shall be kept confidential by the EDA unless
 21  7 otherwise ordered by a court.
 21  8    The division takes effect upon enactment and applies to
 21  9 renewable chemicals produced in Iowa from biomass feedstock on
 21 10 or after that date.  The division applies retroactively to tax
 21 11 years beginning on or after January 1, 2015.
 21 12    DIVISION II ==== ANGEL INVESTOR TAX CREDITS.   Division II
 21 13 makes several changes to the tax credit for investments in
 21 14 qualifying businesses and community=based seed capital funds,
 21 15 often referred to as the angel investor tax credits.  The
 21 16 division amends the purpose of the tax credit in Code section
 21 17 15E.41.  The division excludes investments in community=based
 21 18 seed capital funds from qualifying for the tax credit and
 21 19 makes several conforming amendments to remove references to
 21 20 community=based seed capital funds from the Code.
 21 21    The division modifies the amount and dollar limitation of
 21 22 the tax credit for a taxpayer.  The tax credit is increased
 21 23 from 20 percent to 25 percent of a taxpayer's equity investment
 21 24 in a qualifying business.  Under current law, a taxpayer cannot
 21 25 claim more than $50,000 of tax credit per investment in a
 21 26 qualifying business, and for each tax year a taxpayer and the
 21 27 taxpayer's affiliates cannot claim tax credits for more than
 21 28 five investments in five different qualifying businesses.  The
 21 29 division amends this dollar limitation to prohibit a natural
 21 30 person and the person's spouse, child, or sibling from claiming
 21 31 a combined amount of more than $100,000 in tax credits per tax
 21 32 year.
 21 33    The division also provides that no more than $500,000 in tax
 21 34 credits may be issued per tax year for equity investments in
 21 35 any one qualifying business.
 22  1 The division modifies the procedures for claiming the tax
 22  2 credit.  Under current law, the tax credit is not refundable
 22  3 but available for carryforward for up to five tax years.  The
 22  4 division makes the tax credit refundable for an investment
 22  5 made by a natural person, and for any other person reduces the
 22  6 carryforward period to three years.
 22  7    The division strikes a provision permitting the EDA
 22  8 to cooperate with small business development centers to
 22  9 disseminate information regarding the credits and to develop
 22 10 standard application forms, and requiring the EDA to distribute
 22 11 copies of the application forms to all community=based seed
 22 12 capital funds and potential individual investors.
 22 13    The division modifies the eligibility requirements for
 22 14 qualifying businesses.  The division strikes the requirement
 22 15 that a business have an owner that meets at least one of
 22 16 four qualifications relating to business education or
 22 17 business experience.  The division requires that a business
 22 18 be participating in an entrepreneurial assistance program,
 22 19 as defined in the division, but allows the EDA to waive this
 22 20 requirement if the business establishes that its owners,
 22 21 directors, officers, and employees have an appropriate level
 22 22 of experience such that an entrepreneurial assistance program
 22 23 would not materially change the prospects of the business.
 22 24 The EDA is allowed to consult with outside service providers
 22 25 in considering such a waiver.  The division increases from $5
 22 26 million to $10 million the maximum amount of net worth that
 22 27 a business may have to be considered a qualifying business.
 22 28 The division increases from $250,000 to $500,000 the amount of
 22 29 financing that a business must have in order to be considered a
 22 30 qualifying business, removes "near equity" from the types of
 22 31 financing that will be considered in that calculation, requires
 22 32 that the financing be secured at the time of application for
 22 33 the tax credits, and requires that the business have at least
 22 34 two investors at the time of application for the tax credits.
 22 35 These modified eligibility requirements apply to businesses
 23  1 that submit an application to the EDA to be registered as a
 23  2 qualifying business on or after the effective date of this
 23  3 division of the bill, and businesses that submitted such an
 23  4 application to the EDA before the effective date of this
 23  5 division of the bill shall be governed by current law.
 23  6    The division provides for the confidentiality of certain
 23  7 information with regard to the tax credit.  The identity of
 23  8 a qualifying business, the identity of an investor and the
 23  9 qualifying business in which the investor made an equity
 23 10 investment, and the total number and amount of tax credits
 23 11 issued shall be considered public information under Code
 23 12 chapter 22 (examination of public records), but any other
 23 13 information or record in the possession of the EDA with respect
 23 14 to the program shall be presumed by the EDA to be a trade secret
 23 15 protected under Code chapter 550 or common law and shall be
 23 16 kept confidential by the EDA unless otherwise ordered by a
 23 17 court.
 23 18    The division takes effect upon enactment and applies to
 23 19 equity investments in a qualifying business made on or after
 23 20 that date.  Equity investments in a qualifying business or
 23 21 community=based seed capital fund made prior to the effective
 23 22 date of the division shall be governed by current law.
 23 23    DIVISION III ==== ENTREPRENEUR INVESTMENT AWARDS PROGRAM.
 23 24  Division III amends the entrepreneur investment awards program
 23 25 administered by the EDA.  The division strikes provisions that
 23 26 prohibited the EDA from making awards under the program since
 23 27 July 1, 2014, and that required the EDA by December 31, 2014,
 23 28 to conduct a comprehensive review of the program and submit
 23 29 a report with specified information to the governor and the
 23 30 general assembly.
 23 31    The division modifies the purpose of the program to be
 23 32 to provide financial assistance to eligible entrepreneurial
 23 33 assistance providers (provider) that provide technical and
 23 34 financial assistance to entrepreneurs and start=up companies
 23 35 seeking to create, locate, or expand a business in Iowa.
 24  1 "Financial assistance" is defined in the division.
 24  2    The division changes the requirements for receiving an
 24  3 award.  To be eligible to receive an award under current
 24  4 law, an entrepreneurial assistance program must have been
 24  5 an Iowa=based business, expended at least $500,000 during
 24  6 the previous fiscal year to provide technical and financial
 24  7 assistance services that meet the broad=based needs of
 24  8 entrepreneurs seeking to create, locate, or expand a business
 24  9 in Iowa that intends to derive more than 10 percent of its
 24 10 gross sales from markets outside Iowa; and must have engaged
 24 11 and communicated with certain other programs, funding sources,
 24 12 and entities for its entrepreneur clients.  The division
 24 13 amends the eligibility for receiving financial assistance to
 24 14 require that a provider have its principal place of operations
 24 15 in Iowa and that the provider offer a comprehensive set of
 24 16 business development services to emerging and early=stage
 24 17 innovation companies to assist in the creation, location,
 24 18 growth, and long=term success of the company in Iowa.
 24 19 "Business development services" is defined in the division.
 24 20 Business development services may be performed at the physical
 24 21 location of the provider or the company and may be provided in
 24 22 consideration of equity participation in the company, a fee for
 24 23 services, or a membership agreement with the company.
 24 24    Under current law, the EDA board could approve, deny, or
 24 25 defer each application for a grant, and was required to award
 24 26 grants on a first=come, first=served basis.  The division
 24 27 specifies that the EDA board has the discretion to approve,
 24 28 deny, or defer each application for financial assistance and
 24 29 that the amount of financial assistance awarded to a provider
 24 30 is within the discretion of the EDA.  The division requires
 24 31 the EDA to award financial assistance on a competitive basis
 24 32 and allows the EDA to develop scoring criteria and establish
 24 33 minimum requirements for the receipt of a financial assistance
 24 34 award.
 24 35    In addition to the four factors relating to the provider's
 25  1 professional staff that the EDA may consider under current
 25  2 law in deciding whether to award financial assistance, the
 25  3 division provides that the EDA may also consider the service
 25  4 model and likelihood of success of the provider, the provider's
 25  5 similarity to other successful providers in the country, and
 25  6 the provider's financial need.
 25  7    The division modifies the maximum award amount for a
 25  8 recipient.  Under current law, a grant to an entrepreneur
 25  9 assistance program cannot exceed the lesser of 25 percent of
 25 10 the funds expended by the program during the previous fiscal
 25 11 year, 100 percent of the funds raised from certain persons
 25 12 by the program during the previous fiscal year, or $200,000.
 25 13 The division provides that the amount of financial assistance
 25 14 awarded to any one provider shall not exceed $200,000.
 25 15    The division modifies the permitted use of funds received
 25 16 under the program.  Under current law, grants are only
 25 17 permitted to be used for the purpose of operating costs
 25 18 incurred by the program.  The division specifies that financial
 25 19 assistance awarded to a provider shall only be used for
 25 20 the purpose of operating costs incurred by the provider in
 25 21 the provision of business development services to emerging
 25 22 and early=stage innovation companies in Iowa.  The division
 25 23 further requires that such financial assistance shall not be
 25 24 distributed to owners or investors of the company to which the
 25 25 business development services are being provided and shall not
 25 26 be provided to other persons assisting with the provision of
 25 27 the services.
 25 28    Under current law, an entrepreneurial assistance provider is
 25 29 required to accept client referrals from the EDA as a condition
 25 30 of receiving a grant.  The division provides that the EDA may
 25 31 make client referrals to eligible providers.
 25 32    DIVISION IV ==== MISCELLANEOUS CHANGES.  Division IV makes
 25 33 several miscellaneous changes to other EDA programs.  The
 25 34 division amends the sales and use tax refund available under
 25 35 the workforce housing tax incentive program.  That refund
 26  1 is available for sales and use tax paid prior to project
 26  2 completion, which is currently defined to mean the first date
 26  3 upon which the average annualized production of finished
 26  4 product for the preceding 90=day period at the manufacturing
 26  5 facility operated by the eligible business is at least 50
 26  6 percent of the initial design capacity of the facility.  The
 26  7 division amends the definition of "project completion" to mean
 26  8 the date on which the EDA notifies the department of revenue
 26  9 that all applicable requirements of a workforce housing tax
 26 10 incentive program agreement are satisfied.  This provision
 26 11 takes effect upon enactment and applies retroactively to July
 26 12 1, 2014, for all workforce housing tax incentive agreements
 26 13 entered into on or after that date.
 26 14    The division allows the EDA to extend the project
 26 15 completion date for a project awarded tax incentives under the
 26 16 redevelopment tax credit program and the housing enterprise
 26 17 zone tax incentives program if the property that is the subject
 26 18 of the project suffered a catastrophic fire during the 2014
 26 19 calendar year.

 20  4 the tax credit.
 20  5    The tax credit shall be claimed for the tax year during
 20  6 which the eligible business was issued the tax credit.  The tax
 20  7 credit may be claimed against the individual income tax and the
 20  8 corporate income tax.  The credit is refundable or may, at the
 20  9 election of the taxpayer, be carried forward for up to one tax
 20 10 year.   The tax credit shall not be transferred to any person.  A
 20 11 tax credit issued to a partnership, limited liability company,
 20 12 S corporation, cooperative organized under Code chapter 501
 20 13 and filing as a partnership for federal tax purposes, estate,
 20 14 or trust electing to have the income taxed directly to the
 20 15 individual may be claimed by the individual based upon the pro
 20 16 rata share of the individual's earnings from that entity.
 20 17    The division provides that the program is subject to the
 20 18 EDA's maximum aggregate tax credit cap of $170 million per
 20 19 fiscal year in Code section 15.119, and not more than $15
 20 20 million per fiscal year may be issued by the EDA under the
 20 21 program.  In addition, the maximum amount of tax credit that
 20 22 may be issued to an eligible business in any one calendar year
 20 23 shall not exceed $1 million or $500,000, depending on whether
 20 24 the eligible business has been operating in Iowa at the time of
 20 25 application for five or fewer years, or more than five years,
 20 26 respectively.  An eligible business shall not receive more than
 20 27 five tax credits under the program.  The EDA is required to
 20 28 issue tax credits on a first=come, first=served basis until the
 20 29 maximum amount of $15 million per fiscal year is reached.  If
 20 30 the amount of tax credits exceeds this amount in a fiscal year,
 20 31 the EDA is required to establish a wait list and give priority
 20 32 in subsequent years to the eligible businesses on the wait
 20 33 list.
 20 34    The division provides for the confidentiality of certain
 20 35 information under the program.  The identity of a tax credit
 21  1 recipient and the amount of the tax credit shall be considered
 21  2 public information under Code chapter 22 (examination of public
 21  3 records), but any other information or record in the possession
 21  4 of the EDA with respect to the program shall be presumed by
 21  5 the EDA to be a trade secret protected under Code chapter 550
 21  6 or common law and shall be kept confidential by the EDA unless
 21  7 otherwise ordered by a court.
 21  8    The division takes effect upon enactment and applies to
 21  9 renewable chemicals produced in Iowa from biomass feedstock on
 21 10 or after that date.  The division applies retroactively to tax
 21 11 years beginning on or after January 1, 2015.
 21 12    DIVISION II ==== ANGEL INVESTOR TAX CREDITS.   Division II
 21 13 makes several changes to the tax credit for investments in
 21 14 qualifying businesses and community=based seed capital funds,
 21 15 often referred to as the angel investor tax credits.  The
 21 16 division amends the purpose of the tax credit in Code section
 21 17 15E.41.  The division excludes investments in community=based
 21 18 seed capital funds from qualifying for the tax credit and
 21 19 makes several conforming amendments to remove references to
 21 20 community=based seed capital funds from the Code.
 21 21    The division modifies the amount and dollar limitation of
 21 22 the tax credit for a taxpayer.  The tax credit is increased
 21 23 from 20 percent to 25 percent of a taxpayer's equity investment
 21 24 in a qualifying business.  Under current law, a taxpayer cannot
 21 25 claim more than $50,000 of tax credit per investment in a
 21 26 qualifying business, and for each tax year a taxpayer and the
 21 27 taxpayer's affiliates cannot claim tax credits for more than
 21 28 five investments in five different qualifying businesses.  The
 21 29 division amends this dollar limitation to prohibit a natural
 21 30 person and the person's spouse, child, or sibling from claiming
 21 31 a combined amount of more than $100,000 in tax credits per tax
 21 32 year.
 21 33    The division also provides that no more than $500,000 in tax
 21 34 credits may be issued per tax year for equity investments in
 21 35 any one qualifying business.
 22  1 The division modifies the procedures for claiming the tax
 22  2 credit.  Under current law, the tax credit is not refundable
 22  3 but available for carryforward for up to five tax years.  The
 22  4 division makes the tax credit refundable for an investment
 22  5 made by a natural person, and for any other person reduces the
 22  6 carryforward period to three years.
 22  7    The division strikes a provision permitting the EDA
 22  8 to cooperate with small business development centers to
 22  9 disseminate information regarding the credits and to develop
 22 10 standard application forms, and requiring the EDA to distribute
 22 11 copies of the application forms to all community=based seed
 22 12 capital funds and potential individual investors.
 22 13    The division modifies the eligibility requirements for
 22 14 qualifying businesses.  The division strikes the requirement
 22 15 that a business have an owner that meets at least one of
 22 16 four qualifications relating to business education or
 22 17 business experience.  The division requires that a business
 22 18 be participating in an entrepreneurial assistance program,
 22 19 as defined in the division, but allows the EDA to waive this
 22 20 requirement if the business establishes that its owners,
 22 21 directors, officers, and employees have an appropriate level
 22 22 of experience such that an entrepreneurial assistance program
 22 23 would not materially change the prospects of the business.
 22 24 The EDA is allowed to consult with outside service providers
 22 25 in considering such a waiver.  The division increases from $5
 22 26 million to $10 million the maximum amount of net worth that
 22 27 a business may have to be considered a qualifying business.
 22 28 The division increases from $250,000 to $500,000 the amount of
 22 29 financing that a business must have in order to be considered a
 22 30 qualifying business, removes "near equity" from the types of
 22 31 financing that will be considered in that calculation, requires
 22 32 that the financing be secured at the time of application for
 22 33 the tax credits, and requires that the business have at least
 22 34 two investors at the time of application for the tax credits.
 22 35 These modified eligibility requirements apply to businesses
 23  1 that submit an application to the EDA to be registered as a
 23  2 qualifying business on or after the effective date of this
 23  3 division of the bill, and businesses that submitted such an
 23  4 application to the EDA before the effective date of this
 23  5 division of the bill shall be governed by current law.
 23  6    The division provides for the confidentiality of certain
 23  7 information with regard to the tax credit.  The identity of
 23  8 a qualifying business, the identity of an investor and the
 23  9 qualifying business in which the investor made an equity
 23 10 investment, and the total number and amount of tax credits
 23 11 issued shall be considered public information under Code
 23 12 chapter 22 (examination of public records), but any other
 23 13 information or record in the possession of the EDA with respect
 23 14 to the program shall be presumed by the EDA to be a trade secret
 23 15 protected under Code chapter 550 or common law and shall be
 23 16 kept confidential by the EDA unless otherwise ordered by a
 23 17 court.
 23 18    The division takes effect upon enactment and applies to
 23 19 equity investments in a qualifying business made on or after
 23 20 that date.  Equity investments in a qualifying business or
 23 21 community=based seed capital fund made prior to the effective
 23 22 date of the division shall be governed by current law.
 23 23    DIVISION III ==== ENTREPRENEUR INVESTMENT AWARDS PROGRAM.
 23 24  Division III amends the entrepreneur investment awards program
 23 25 administered by the EDA.  The division strikes provisions that
 23 26 prohibited the EDA from making awards under the program since
 23 27 July 1, 2014, and that required the EDA by December 31, 2014,
 23 28 to conduct a comprehensive review of the program and submit
 23 29 a report with specified information to the governor and the
 23 30 general assembly.
 23 31    The division modifies the purpose of the program to be
 23 32 to provide financial assistance to eligible entrepreneurial
 23 33 assistance providers (provider) that provide technical and
 23 34 financial assistance to entrepreneurs and start=up companies
 23 35 seeking to create, locate, or expand a business in Iowa.
 24  1 "Financial assistance" is defined in the division.
 24  2    The division changes the requirements for receiving an
 24  3 award.  To be eligible to receive an award under current
 24  4 law, an entrepreneurial assistance program must have been
 24  5 an Iowa=based business, expended at least $500,000 during
 24  6 the previous fiscal year to provide technical and financial
 24  7 assistance services that meet the broad=based needs of
 24  8 entrepreneurs seeking to create, locate, or expand a business
 24  9 in Iowa that intends to derive more than 10 percent of its
 24 10 gross sales from markets outside Iowa; and must have engaged
 24 11 and communicated with certain other programs, funding sources,
 24 12 and entities for its entrepreneur clients.  The division
 24 13 amends the eligibility for receiving financial assistance to
 24 14 require that a provider have its principal place of operations
 24 15 in Iowa and that the provider offer a comprehensive set of
 24 16 business development services to emerging and early=stage
 24 17 innovation companies to assist in the creation, location,
 24 18 growth, and long=term success of the company in Iowa.
 24 19 "Business development services" is defined in the division.
 24 20 Business development services may be performed at the physical
 24 21 location of the provider or the company and may be provided in
 24 22 consideration of equity participation in the company, a fee for
 24 23 services, or a membership agreement with the company.
 24 24    Under current law, the EDA board could approve, deny, or
 24 25 defer each application for a grant, and was required to award
 24 26 grants on a first=come, first=served basis.  The division
 24 27 specifies that the EDA board has the discretion to approve,
 24 28 deny, or defer each application for financial assistance and
 24 29 that the amount of financial assistance awarded to a provider
 24 30 is within the discretion of the EDA.  The division requires
 24 31 the EDA to award financial assistance on a competitive basis
 24 32 and allows the EDA to develop scoring criteria and establish
 24 33 minimum requirements for the receipt of a financial assistance
 24 34 award.
 24 35    In addition to the four factors relating to the provider's
 25  1 professional staff that the EDA may consider under current
 25  2 law in deciding whether to award financial assistance, the
 25  3 division provides that the EDA may also consider the service
 25  4 model and likelihood of success of the provider, the provider's
 25  5 similarity to other successful providers in the country, and
 25  6 the provider's financial need.
 25  7    The division modifies the maximum award amount for a
 25  8 recipient.  Under current law, a grant to an entrepreneur
 25  9 assistance program cannot exceed the lesser of 25 percent of
 25 10 the funds expended by the program during the previous fiscal
 25 11 year, 100 percent of the funds raised from certain persons
 25 12 by the program during the previous fiscal year, or $200,000.
 25 13 The division provides that the amount of financial assistance
 25 14 awarded to any one provider shall not exceed $200,000.
 25 15    The division modifies the permitted use of funds received
 25 16 under the program.  Under current law, grants are only
 25 17 permitted to be used for the purpose of operating costs
 25 18 incurred by the program.  The division specifies that financial
 25 19 assistance awarded to a provider shall only be used for
 25 20 the purpose of operating costs incurred by the provider in
 25 21 the provision of business development services to emerging
 25 22 and early=stage innovation companies in Iowa.  The division
 25 23 further requires that such financial assistance shall not be
 25 24 distributed to owners or investors of the company to which the
 25 25 business development services are being provided and shall not
 25 26 be provided to other persons assisting with the provision of
 25 27 the services.
 25 28    Under current law, an entrepreneurial assistance provider is
 25 29 required to accept client referrals from the EDA as a condition
 25 30 of receiving a grant.  The division provides that the EDA may
 25 31 make client referrals to eligible providers.
 25 32    DIVISION IV ==== MISCELLANEOUS CHANGES.  Division IV makes
 25 33 several miscellaneous changes to other EDA programs.  The
 25 34 division amends the sales and use tax refund available under
 25 35 the workforce housing tax incentive program.  That refund
 26  1 is available for sales and use tax paid prior to project
 26  2 completion, which is currently defined to mean the first date
 26  3 upon which the average annualized production of finished
 26  4 product for the preceding 90=day period at the manufacturing
 26  5 facility operated by the eligible business is at least 50
 26  6 percent of the initial design capacity of the facility.  The
 26  7 division amends the definition of "project completion" to mean
 26  8 the date on which the EDA notifies the department of revenue
 26  9 that all applicable requirements of a workforce housing tax
 26 10 incentive program agreement are satisfied.  This provision
 26 11 takes effect upon enactment and applies retroactively to July
 26 12 1, 2014, for all workforce housing tax incentive agreements
 26 13 entered into on or after that date.
 26 14    The division allows the EDA to extend the project
 26 15 completion date for a project awarded tax incentives under the
 26 16 redevelopment tax credit program and the housing enterprise
 26 17 zone tax incentives program if the property that is the subject
 26 18 of the project suffered a catastrophic fire during the 2014
 26 19 calendar year.
       LSB 1212HV (3) 86
       mm/sc
 20  5    The tax credit shall be claimed for the tax year during
 20  6 which the eligible business was issued the tax credit.  The tax
 20  7 credit may be claimed against the individual income tax and the
 20  8 corporate income tax.  The credit is refundable or may, at the
 20  9 election of the taxpayer, be carried forward for up to one tax
 20 10 year.   The tax credit shall not be transferred to any person.  A
 20 11 tax credit issued to a partnership, limited liability company,
 20 12 S corporation, cooperative organized under Code chapter 501
 20 13 and filing as a partnership for federal tax purposes, estate,
 20 14 or trust electing to have the income taxed directly to the
 20 15 individual may be claimed by the individual based upon the pro
 20 16 rata share of the individual's earnings from that entity.
 20 17    The division provides that the program is subject to the
 20 18 EDA's maximum aggregate tax credit cap of $170 million per
 20 19 fiscal year in Code section 15.119, and not more than $15
 20 20 million per fiscal year may be issued by the EDA under the
 20 21 program.  In addition, the maximum amount of tax credit that
 20 22 may be issued to an eligible business in any one calendar year
 20 23 shall not exceed $1 million or $500,000, depending on whether
 20 24 the eligible business has been operating in Iowa at the time of
 20 25 application for five or fewer years, or more than five years,
 20 26 respectively.  An eligible business shall not receive more than
 20 27 five tax credits under the program.  The EDA is required to
 20 28 issue tax credits on a first=come, first=served basis until the
 20 29 maximum amount of $15 million per fiscal year is reached.  If
 20 30 the amount of tax credits exceeds this amount in a fiscal year,
 20 31 the EDA is required to establish a wait list and give priority
 20 32 in subsequent years to the eligible businesses on the wait
 20 33 list.
 20 34    The division provides for the confidentiality of certain
 20 35 information under the program.  The identity of a tax credit
 21  1 recipient and the amount of the tax credit shall be considered
 21  2 public information under Code chapter 22 (examination of public
 21  3 records), but any other information or record in the possession
 21  4 of the EDA with respect to the program shall be presumed by
 21  5 the EDA to be a trade secret protected under Code chapter 550
 21  6 or common law and shall be kept confidential by the EDA unless
 21  7 otherwise ordered by a court.
 21  8    The division takes effect upon enactment and applies to
 21  9 renewable chemicals produced in Iowa from biomass feedstock on
 21 10 or after that date.  The division applies retroactively to tax
 21 11 years beginning on or after January 1, 2015.
 21 12    DIVISION II ==== ANGEL INVESTOR TAX CREDITS.   Division II
 21 13 makes several changes to the tax credit for investments in
 21 14 qualifying businesses and community=based seed capital funds,
 21 15 often referred to as the angel investor tax credits.  The
 21 16 division amends the purpose of the tax credit in Code section
 21 17 15E.41.  The division excludes investments in community=based
 21 18 seed capital funds from qualifying for the tax credit and
 21 19 makes several conforming amendments to remove references to
 21 20 community=based seed capital funds from the Code.
 21 21    The division modifies the amount and dollar limitation of
 21 22 the tax credit for a taxpayer.  The tax credit is increased
 21 23 from 20 percent to 25 percent of a taxpayer's equity investment
 21 24 in a qualifying business.  Under current law, a taxpayer cannot
 21 25 claim more than $50,000 of tax credit per investment in a
 21 26 qualifying business, and for each tax year a taxpayer and the
 21 27 taxpayer's affiliates cannot claim tax credits for more than
 21 28 five investments in five different qualifying businesses.  The
 21 29 division amends this dollar limitation to prohibit a natural
 21 30 person and the person's spouse, child, or sibling from claiming
 21 31 a combined amount of more than $100,000 in tax credits per tax
 21 32 year.
 21 33    The division also provides that no more than $500,000 in tax
 21 34 credits may be issued per tax year for equity investments in
 21 35 any one qualifying business.
 22  1 The division modifies the procedures for claiming the tax
 22  2 credit.  Under current law, the tax credit is not refundable
 22  3 but available for carryforward for up to five tax years.  The
 22  4 division makes the tax credit refundable for an investment
 22  5 made by a natural person, and for any other person reduces the
 22  6 carryforward period to three years.
 22  7    The division strikes a provision permitting the EDA
 22  8 to cooperate with small business development centers to
 22  9 disseminate information regarding the credits and to develop
 22 10 standard application forms, and requiring the EDA to distribute
 22 11 copies of the application forms to all community=based seed
 22 12 capital funds and potential individual investors.
 22 13    The division modifies the eligibility requirements for
 22 14 qualifying businesses.  The division strikes the requirement
 22 15 that a business have an owner that meets at least one of
 22 16 four qualifications relating to business education or
 22 17 business experience.  The division requires that a business
 22 18 be participating in an entrepreneurial assistance program,
 22 19 as defined in the division, but allows the EDA to waive this
 22 20 requirement if the business establishes that its owners,
 22 21 directors, officers, and employees have an appropriate level
 22 22 of experience such that an entrepreneurial assistance program
 22 23 would not materially change the prospects of the business.
 22 24 The EDA is allowed to consult with outside service providers
 22 25 in considering such a waiver.  The division increases from $5
 22 26 million to $10 million the maximum amount of net worth that
 22 27 a business may have to be considered a qualifying business.
 22 28 The division increases from $250,000 to $500,000 the amount of
 22 29 financing that a business must have in order to be considered a
 22 30 qualifying business, removes "near equity" from the types of
 22 31 financing that will be considered in that calculation, requires
 22 32 that the financing be secured at the time of application for
 22 33 the tax credits, and requires that the business have at least
 22 34 two investors at the time of application for the tax credits.
 22 35 These modified eligibility requirements apply to businesses
 23  1 that submit an application to the EDA to be registered as a
 23  2 qualifying business on or after the effective date of this
 23  3 division of the bill, and businesses that submitted such an
 23  4 application to the EDA before the effective date of this
 23  5 division of the bill shall be governed by current law.
 23  6    The division provides for the confidentiality of certain
 23  7 information with regard to the tax credit.  The identity of
 23  8 a qualifying business, the identity of an investor and the
 23  9 qualifying business in which the investor made an equity
 23 10 investment, and the total number and amount of tax credits
 23 11 issued shall be considered public information under Code
 23 12 chapter 22 (examination of public records), but any other
 23 13 information or record in the possession of the EDA with respect
 23 14 to the program shall be presumed by the EDA to be a trade secret
 23 15 protected under Code chapter 550 or common law and shall be
 23 16 kept confidential by the EDA unless otherwise ordered by a
 23 17 court.
 23 18    The division takes effect upon enactment and applies to
 23 19 equity investments in a qualifying business made on or after
 23 20 that date.  Equity investments in a qualifying business or
 23 21 community=based seed capital fund made prior to the effective
 23 22 date of the division shall be governed by current law.
 23 23    DIVISION III ==== ENTREPRENEUR INVESTMENT AWARDS PROGRAM.
 23 24  Division III amends the entrepreneur investment awards program
 23 25 administered by the EDA.  The division strikes provisions that
 23 26 prohibited the EDA from making awards under the program since
 23 27 July 1, 2014, and that required the EDA by December 31, 2014,
 23 28 to conduct a comprehensive review of the program and submit
 23 29 a report with specified information to the governor and the
 23 30 general assembly.
 23 31    The division modifies the purpose of the program to be
 23 32 to provide financial assistance to eligible entrepreneurial
 23 33 assistance providers (provider) that provide technical and
 23 34 financial assistance to entrepreneurs and start=up companies
 23 35 seeking to create, locate, or expand a business in Iowa.
 24  1 "Financial assistance" is defined in the division.
 24  2    The division changes the requirements for receiving an
 24  3 award.  To be eligible to receive an award under current
 24  4 law, an entrepreneurial assistance program must have been
 24  5 an Iowa=based business, expended at least $500,000 during
 24  6 the previous fiscal year to provide technical and financial
 24  7 assistance services that meet the broad=based needs of

 24  9 in Iowa that intends to derive more than 10 percent of its
 24 10 gross sales from markets outside Iowa; and must have engaged
 24 11 and communicated with certain other programs, funding sources,
 24 12 and entities for its entrepreneur clients.  The division
 24 13 amends the eligibility for receiving financial assistance to
 24 14 require that a provider have its principal place of operations
 24 15 in Iowa and that the provider offer a comprehensive set of
 24 16 business development services to emerging and early=stage
 24 17 innovation companies to assist in the creation, location,
 24 18 growth, and long=term success of the company in Iowa.
 24 19 "Business development services" is defined in the division.
 24 20 Business development services may be performed at the physical
 24 21 location of the provider or the company and may be provided in
 24 22 consideration of equity participation in the company, a fee for
 24 23 services, or a membership agreement with the company.
 24 24    Under current law, the EDA board could approve, deny, or
 24 25 defer each application for a grant, and was required to award
 24 26 grants on a first=come, first=served basis.  The division
 24 27 specifies that the EDA board has the discretion to approve,
 24 28 deny, or defer each application for financial assistance and
 24 29 that the amount of financial assistance awarded to a provider
 24 30 is within the discretion of the EDA.  The division requires
 24 31 the EDA to award financial assistance on a competitive basis
 24 32 and allows the EDA to develop scoring criteria and establish
 24 33 minimum requirements for the receipt of a financial assistance
 24 34 award.
 24 35    In addition to the four factors relating to the provider's
 25  1 professional staff that the EDA may consider under current
 25  2 law in deciding whether to award financial assistance, the
 25  3 division provides that the EDA may also consider the service
 25  4 model and likelihood of success of the provider, the provider's
 25  5 similarity to other successful providers in the country, and
 25  6 the provider's financial need.
 25  7    The division modifies the maximum award amount for a
 25  8 recipient.  Under current law, a grant to an entrepreneur
 25  9 assistance program cannot exceed the lesser of 25 percent of
 25 10 the funds expended by the program during the previous fiscal
 25 11 year, 100 percent of the funds raised from certain persons
 25 12 by the program during the previous fiscal year, or $200,000.
 25 13 The division provides that the amount of financial assistance
 25 14 awarded to any one provider shall not exceed $200,000.
 25 15    The division modifies the permitted use of funds received
 25 16 under the program.  Under current law, grants are only
 25 17 permitted to be used for the purpose of operating costs
 25 18 incurred by the program.  The division specifies that financial
 25 19 assistance awarded to a provider shall only be used for
 25 20 the purpose of operating costs incurred by the provider in
 25 21 the provision of business development services to emerging
 25 22 and early=stage innovation companies in Iowa.  The division
 25 23 further requires that such financial assistance shall not be
 25 24 distributed to owners or investors of the company to which the
 25 25 business development services are being provided and shall not
 25 26 be provided to other persons assisting with the provision of
 25 27 the services.
 25 28    Under current law, an entrepreneurial assistance provider is
 25 29 required to accept client referrals from the EDA as a condition
 25 30 of receiving a grant.  The division provides that the EDA may
 25 31 make client referrals to eligible providers.
 25 32    DIVISION IV ==== MISCELLANEOUS CHANGES.  Division IV makes
 25 33 several miscellaneous changes to other EDA programs.  The
 25 34 division amends the sales and use tax refund available under
 25 35 the workforce housing tax incentive program.  That refund
 26  1 is available for sales and use tax paid prior to project
 26  2 completion, which is currently defined to mean the first date

 26  7 division amends the definition of "project completion" to mean
 26  8 the date on which the EDA notifies the department of revenue
 26  9 that all applicable requirements of a workforce housing tax
 26 10 incentive program agreement are satisfied.  This provision

 20 22 may be issued to an eligible business in any one calendar year
 20 23 shall not exceed $1 million or $500,000, depending on whether
 20 24 the eligible business has been operating in Iowa at the time of
 20 25 application for five or fewer years, or more than five years,
 20 26 respectively.  An eligible business shall not receive more than
 20 27 five tax credits under the program.  The EDA is required to
 20 28 issue tax credits on a first=come, first=served basis until the
 20 29 maximum amount of $15 million per fiscal year is reached.  If
 20 30 the amount of tax credits exceeds this amount in a fiscal year,
 20 31 the EDA is required to establish a wait list and give priority
 20 32 in subsequent years to the eligible businesses on the wait
 20 33 list.

 21 12    DIVISION II ==== ANGEL INVESTOR TAX CREDITS.   Division II
 21 13 makes several changes to the tax credit for investments in
 21 14 qualifying businesses and community=based seed capital funds,
 21 15 often referred to as the angel investor tax credits.  The
 21 16 division amends the purpose of the tax credit in Code section

 21 18 seed capital funds from qualifying for the tax credit and
 21 19 makes several conforming amendments to remove references to
 21 20 community=based seed capital funds from the Code.
 21 21    The division modifies the amount and dollar limitation of
 21 22 the tax credit for a taxpayer.  The tax credit is increased
 21 23 from 20 percent to 25 percent of a taxpayer's equity investment
 21 24 in a qualifying business.  Under current law, a taxpayer cannot

 21 28 five investments in five different qualifying businesses.  The
 21 29 division amends this dollar limitation to prohibit a natural
 21 30 person and the person's spouse, child, or sibling from claiming
 21 31 a combined amount of more than $100,000 in tax credits per tax
 21 32 year.
 21 33    The division also provides that no more than $500,000 in tax
 21 34 credits may be issued per tax year for equity investments in
 21 35 any one qualifying business.
 22  1 The division modifies the procedures for claiming the tax
 22  2 credit.  Under current law, the tax credit is not refundable
 22  3 but available for carryforward for up to five tax years.  The
 22  4 division makes the tax credit refundable for an investment
 22  5 made by a natural person, and for any other person reduces the
 22  6 carryforward period to three years.
 22  7    The division strikes a provision permitting the EDA

 22 13    The division modifies the eligibility requirements for
 22 14 qualifying businesses.  The division strikes the requirement
 22 15 that a business have an owner that meets at least one of
 22 16 four qualifications relating to business education or
 22 17 business experience.  The division requires that a business
 22 18 be participating in an entrepreneurial assistance program,

 22 20 requirement if the business establishes that its owners,
 22 21 directors, officers, and employees have an appropriate level
 22 22 of experience such that an entrepreneurial assistance program
 22 23 would not materially change the prospects of the business.
 22 24 The EDA is allowed to consult with outside service providers
 22 25 in considering such a waiver.  The division increases from $5
 22 26 million to $10 million the maximum amount of net worth that
 22 27 a business may have to be considered a qualifying business.
 22 28 The division increases from $250,000 to $500,000 the amount of
 22 29 financing that a business must have in order to be considered a
 22 30 qualifying business, removes "near equity" from the types of
 22 31 financing that will be considered in that calculation, requires
 22 32 that the financing be secured at the time of application for
 22 33 the tax credits, and requires that the business have at least
 22 34 two investors at the time of application for the tax credits.
 22 35 These modified eligibility requirements apply to businesses
 23  1 that submit an application to the EDA to be registered as a
 23  2 qualifying business on or after the effective date of this
 23  3 division of the bill, and businesses that submitted such an
 23  4 application to the EDA before the effective date of this
 23  5 division of the bill shall be governed by current law.
 23  6    The division provides for the confidentiality of certain
 23  7 information with regard to the tax credit.  The identity of
 23  8 a qualifying business, the identity of an investor and the
 23  9 qualifying business in which the investor made an equity
 23 10 investment, and the total number and amount of tax credits
 23 11 issued shall be considered public information under Code
 23 12 chapter 22 (examination of public records), but any other
 23 13 information or record in the possession of the EDA with respect
 23 14 to the program shall be presumed by the EDA to be a trade secret
 23 15 protected under Code chapter 550 or common law and shall be
 23 16 kept confidential by the EDA unless otherwise ordered by a
 23 17 court.
 23 18    The division takes effect upon enactment and applies to
 23 19 equity investments in a qualifying business made on or after
 23 20 that date.  Equity investments in a qualifying business or
 23 21 community=based seed capital fund made prior to the effective
 23 22 date of the division shall be governed by current law.
 23 23    DIVISION III ==== ENTREPRENEUR INVESTMENT AWARDS PROGRAM.
 23 24  Division III amends the entrepreneur investment awards program
 23 25 administered by the EDA.  The division strikes provisions that
 23 26 prohibited the EDA from making awards under the program since
 23 27 July 1, 2014, and that required the EDA by December 31, 2014,
 23 28 to conduct a comprehensive review of the program and submit
 23 29 a report with specified information to the governor and the
 23 30 general assembly.
 23 31    The division modifies the purpose of the program to be
 23 32 to provide financial assistance to eligible entrepreneurial
 23 33 assistance providers (provider) that provide technical and
 23 34 financial assistance to entrepreneurs and start=up companies
 23 35 seeking to create, locate, or expand a business in Iowa.
 24  1 "Financial assistance" is defined in the division.
 24  2    The division changes the requirements for receiving an
 24  3 award.  To be eligible to receive an award under current
 24  4 law, an entrepreneurial assistance program must have been
 24  5 an Iowa=based business, expended at least $500,000 during
 24  6 the previous fiscal year to provide technical and financial
 24  7 assistance services that meet the broad=based needs of
 24  8 entrepreneurs seeking to create, locate, or expand a business
 24  9 in Iowa that intends to derive more than 10 percent of its
 24 10 gross sales from markets outside Iowa; and must have engaged
 24 11 and communicated with certain other programs, funding sources,
 24 12 and entities for its entrepreneur clients.  The division
 24 13 amends the eligibility for receiving financial assistance to
 24 14 require that a provider have its principal place of operations
 24 15 in Iowa and that the provider offer a comprehensive set of
 24 16 business development services to emerging and early=stage
 24 17 innovation companies to assist in the creation, location,
 24 18 growth, and long=term success of the company in Iowa.
 24 19 "Business development services" is defined in the division.
 24 20 Business development services may be performed at the physical
 24 21 location of the provider or the company and may be provided in
 24 22 consideration of equity participation in the company, a fee for
 24 23 services, or a membership agreement with the company.
 24 24    Under current law, the EDA board could approve, deny, or
 24 25 defer each application for a grant, and was required to award
 24 26 grants on a first=come, first=served basis.  The division
 24 27 specifies that the EDA board has the discretion to approve,
 24 28 deny, or defer each application for financial assistance and
 24 29 that the amount of financial assistance awarded to a provider
 24 30 is within the discretion of the EDA.  The division requires
 24 31 the EDA to award financial assistance on a competitive basis
 24 32 and allows the EDA to develop scoring criteria and establish
 24 33 minimum requirements for the receipt of a financial assistance
 24 34 award.
 24 35    In addition to the four factors relating to the provider's
 25  1 professional staff that the EDA may consider under current
 25  2 law in deciding whether to award financial assistance, the
 25  3 division provides that the EDA may also consider the service
 25  4 model and likelihood of success of the provider, the provider's
 25  5 similarity to other successful providers in the country, and
 25  6 the provider's financial need.
 25  7    The division modifies the maximum award amount for a
 25  8 recipient.  Under current law, a grant to an entrepreneur
 25  9 assistance program cannot exceed the lesser of 25 percent of
 25 10 the funds expended by the program during the previous fiscal
 25 11 year, 100 percent of the funds raised from certain persons
 25 12 by the program during the previous fiscal year, or $200,000.
 25 13 The division provides that the amount of financial assistance
 25 14 awarded to any one provider shall not exceed $200,000.
 25 15    The division modifies the permitted use of funds received
 25 16 under the program.  Under current law, grants are only
 25 17 permitted to be used for the purpose of operating costs
 25 18 incurred by the program.  The division specifies that financial
 25 19 assistance awarded to a provider shall only be used for
 25 20 the purpose of operating costs incurred by the provider in
 25 21 the provision of business development services to emerging
 25 22 and early=stage innovation companies in Iowa.  The division
 25 23 further requires that such financial assistance shall not be
 25 24 distributed to owners or investors of the company to which the
 25 25 business development services are being provided and shall not
 25 26 be provided to other persons assisting with the provision of
 25 27 the services.
 25 28    Under current law, an entrepreneurial assistance provider is
 25 29 required to accept client referrals from the EDA as a condition
 25 30 of receiving a grant.  The division provides that the EDA may
 25 31 make client referrals to eligible providers.
 25 32    DIVISION IV ==== MISCELLANEOUS CHANGES.  Division IV makes
 25 33 several miscellaneous changes to other EDA programs.  The
 25 34 division amends the sales and use tax refund available under
 25 35 the workforce housing tax incentive program.  That refund
 26  1 is available for sales and use tax paid prior to project
 26  2 completion, which is currently defined to mean the first date
 26  3 upon which the average annualized production of finished
 26  4 product for the preceding 90=day period at the manufacturing
 26  5 facility operated by the eligible business is at least 50
 26  6 percent of the initial design capacity of the facility.  The
 26  7 division amends the definition of "project completion" to mean
 26  8 the date on which the EDA notifies the department of revenue
 26  9 that all applicable requirements of a workforce housing tax
 26 10 incentive program agreement are satisfied.  This provision
 26 11 takes effect upon enactment and applies retroactively to July
 26 12 1, 2014, for all workforce housing tax incentive agreements
 26 13 entered into on or after that date.
 26 14    The division allows the EDA to extend the project
 26 15 completion date for a project awarded tax incentives under the
 26 16 redevelopment tax credit program and the housing enterprise
 26 17 zone tax incentives program if the property that is the subject
 26 18 of the project suffered a catastrophic fire during the 2014
 26 19 calendar year.

 20  7 credit may be claimed against the individual income tax and the
 20  8 corporate income tax.  The credit is refundable or may, at the
 20  9 election of the taxpayer, be carried forward for up to one tax
 20 10 year.   The tax credit shall not be transferred to any person.  A
 20 11 tax credit issued to a partnership, limited liability company,
 20 12 S corporation, cooperative organized under Code chapter 501
 20 13 and filing as a partnership for federal tax purposes, estate,
 20 14 or trust electing to have the income taxed directly to the
 20 15 individual may be claimed by the individual based upon the pro
 20 16 rata share of the individual's earnings from that entity.
 20 17    The division provides that the program is subject to the
 20 18 EDA's maximum aggregate tax credit cap of $170 million per
 20 19 fiscal year in Code section 15.119, and not more than $15
 20 20 million per fiscal year may be issued by the EDA under the
 20 21 program.  In addition, the maximum amount of tax credit that
 20 22 may be issued to an eligible business in any one calendar year
 20 23 shall not exceed $1 million or $500,000, depending on whether
 20 24 the eligible business has been operating in Iowa at the time of
 20 25 application for five or fewer years, or more than five years,
 20 26 respectively.  An eligible business shall not receive more than
 20 27 five tax credits under the program.  The EDA is required to
 20 28 issue tax credits on a first=come, first=served basis until the
 20 29 maximum amount of $15 million per fiscal year is reached.  If
 20 30 the amount of tax credits exceeds this amount in a fiscal year,
 20 31 the EDA is required to establish a wait list and give priority
 20 32 in subsequent years to the eligible businesses on the wait
 20 33 list.
 20 34    The division provides for the confidentiality of certain
 20 35 information under the program.  The identity of a tax credit
 21  1 recipient and the amount of the tax credit shall be considered
 21  2 public information under Code chapter 22 (examination of public
 21  3 records), but any other information or record in the possession
 21  4 of the EDA with respect to the program shall be presumed by
 21  5 the EDA to be a trade secret protected under Code chapter 550
 21  6 or common law and shall be kept confidential by the EDA unless
 21  7 otherwise ordered by a court.
 21  8    The division takes effect upon enactment and applies to
 21  9 renewable chemicals produced in Iowa from biomass feedstock on
 21 10 or after that date.  The division applies retroactively to tax
 21 11 years beginning on or after January 1, 2015.
 21 12    DIVISION II ==== ANGEL INVESTOR TAX CREDITS.   Division II
 21 13 makes several changes to the tax credit for investments in
 21 14 qualifying businesses and community=based seed capital funds,
 21 15 often referred to as the angel investor tax credits.  The
 21 16 division amends the purpose of the tax credit in Code section
 21 17 15E.41.  The division excludes investments in community=based
 21 18 seed capital funds from qualifying for the tax credit and
 21 19 makes several conforming amendments to remove references to
 21 20 community=based seed capital funds from the Code.
 21 21    The division modifies the amount and dollar limitation of
 21 22 the tax credit for a taxpayer.  The tax credit is increased
 21 23 from 20 percent to 25 percent of a taxpayer's equity investment
 21 24 in a qualifying business.  Under current law, a taxpayer cannot
 21 25 claim more than $50,000 of tax credit per investment in a
 21 26 qualifying business, and for each tax year a taxpayer and the
 21 27 taxpayer's affiliates cannot claim tax credits for more than
 21 28 five investments in five different qualifying businesses.  The
 21 29 division amends this dollar limitation to prohibit a natural
 21 30 person and the person's spouse, child, or sibling from claiming
 21 31 a combined amount of more than $100,000 in tax credits per tax
 21 32 year.
 21 33    The division also provides that no more than $500,000 in tax
 21 34 credits may be issued per tax year for equity investments in
 21 35 any one qualifying business.
 22  1 The division modifies the procedures for claiming the tax
 22  2 credit.  Under current law, the tax credit is not refundable
 22  3 but available for carryforward for up to five tax years.  The
 22  4 division makes the tax credit refundable for an investment
 22  5 made by a natural person, and for any other person reduces the
 22  6 carryforward period to three years.
 22  7    The division strikes a provision permitting the EDA
 22  8 to cooperate with small business development centers to
 22  9 disseminate information regarding the credits and to develop
 22 10 standard application forms, and requiring the EDA to distribute
 22 11 copies of the application forms to all community=based seed
 22 12 capital funds and potential individual investors.
 22 13    The division modifies the eligibility requirements for
 22 14 qualifying businesses.  The division strikes the requirement
 22 15 that a business have an owner that meets at least one of
 22 16 four qualifications relating to business education or
 22 17 business experience.  The division requires that a business
 22 18 be participating in an entrepreneurial assistance program,
 22 19 as defined in the division, but allows the EDA to waive this
 22 20 requirement if the business establishes that its owners,
 22 21 directors, officers, and employees have an appropriate level
 22 22 of experience such that an entrepreneurial assistance program
 22 23 would not materially change the prospects of the business.
 22 24 The EDA is allowed to consult with outside service providers
 22 25 in considering such a waiver.  The division increases from $5
 22 26 million to $10 million the maximum amount of net worth that
 22 27 a business may have to be considered a qualifying business.
 22 28 The division increases from $250,000 to $500,000 the amount of
 22 29 financing that a business must have in order to be considered a
 22 30 qualifying business, removes "near equity" from the types of
 22 31 financing that will be considered in that calculation, requires
 22 32 that the financing be secured at the time of application for
 22 33 the tax credits, and requires that the business have at least
 22 34 two investors at the time of application for the tax credits.
 22 35 These modified eligibility requirements apply to businesses
 23  1 that submit an application to the EDA to be registered as a
 23  2 qualifying business on or after the effective date of this
 23  3 division of the bill, and businesses that submitted such an
 23  4 application to the EDA before the effective date of this
 23  5 division of the bill shall be governed by current law.
 23  6    The division provides for the confidentiality of certain
 23  7 information with regard to the tax credit.  The identity of
 23  8 a qualifying business, the identity of an investor and the
 23  9 qualifying business in which the investor made an equity
 23 10 investment, and the total number and amount of tax credits
 23 11 issued shall be considered public information under Code
 23 12 chapter 22 (examination of public records), but any other
 23 13 information or record in the possession of the EDA with respect
 23 14 to the program shall be presumed by the EDA to be a trade secret
 23 15 protected under Code chapter 550 or common law and shall be
 23 16 kept confidential by the EDA unless otherwise ordered by a
 23 17 court.
 23 18    The division takes effect upon enactment and applies to
 23 19 equity investments in a qualifying business made on or after
 23 20 that date.  Equity investments in a qualifying business or
 23 21 community=based seed capital fund made prior to the effective
 23 22 date of the division shall be governed by current law.
 23 23    DIVISION III ==== ENTREPRENEUR INVESTMENT AWARDS PROGRAM.
 23 24  Division III amends the entrepreneur investment awards program
 23 25 administered by the EDA.  The division strikes provisions that
 23 26 prohibited the EDA from making awards under the program since
 23 27 July 1, 2014, and that required the EDA by December 31, 2014,
 23 28 to conduct a comprehensive review of the program and submit
 23 29 a report with specified information to the governor and the
 23 30 general assembly.
 23 31    The division modifies the purpose of the program to be
 23 32 to provide financial assistance to eligible entrepreneurial
 23 33 assistance providers (provider) that provide technical and
 23 34 financial assistance to entrepreneurs and start=up companies
 23 35 seeking to create, locate, or expand a business in Iowa.

 24 15 in Iowa and that the provider offer a comprehensive set of
 24 16 business development services to emerging and early=stage
 24 17 innovation companies to assist in the creation, location,
 24 18 growth, and long=term success of the company in Iowa.
 24 19 "Business development services" is defined in the division.
 24 20 Business development services may be performed at the physical
 24 21 location of the provider or the company and may be provided in
 24 22 consideration of equity participation in the company, a fee for
 24 23 services, or a membership agreement with the company.
 24 24    Under current law, the EDA board could approve, deny, or
 24 25 defer each application for a grant, and was required to award
 24 26 grants on a first=come, first=served basis.  The division
 24 27 specifies that the EDA board has the discretion to approve,
 24 28 deny, or defer each application for financial assistance and
 24 29 that the amount of financial assistance awarded to a provider
 24 30 is within the discretion of the EDA.  The division requires
 24 31 the EDA to award financial assistance on a competitive basis
 24 32 and allows the EDA to develop scoring criteria and establish
 24 33 minimum requirements for the receipt of a financial assistance
 24 34 award.
 24 35    In addition to the four factors relating to the provider's
 25  1 professional staff that the EDA may consider under current
 25  2 law in deciding whether to award financial assistance, the
 25  3 division provides that the EDA may also consider the service
 25  4 model and likelihood of success of the provider, the provider's
 25  5 similarity to other successful providers in the country, and
 25  6 the provider's financial need.
 25  7    The division modifies the maximum award amount for a
 25  8 recipient.  Under current law, a grant to an entrepreneur
 25  9 assistance program cannot exceed the lesser of 25 percent of
 25 10 the funds expended by the program during the previous fiscal
 25 11 year, 100 percent of the funds raised from certain persons
 25 12 by the program during the previous fiscal year, or $200,000.
 25 13 The division provides that the amount of financial assistance
 25 14 awarded to any one provider shall not exceed $200,000.
 25 15    The division modifies the permitted use of funds received
 25 16 under the program.  Under current law, grants are only
 25 17 permitted to be used for the purpose of operating costs
 25 18 incurred by the program.  The division specifies that financial
 25 19 assistance awarded to a provider shall only be used for
 25 20 the purpose of operating costs incurred by the provider in
 25 21 the provision of business development services to emerging

 25 23 further requires that such financial assistance shall not be
 25 24 distributed to owners or investors of the company to which the
 25 25 business development services are being provided and shall not
 25 26 be provided to other persons assisting with the provision of

 25 28    Under current law, an entrepreneurial assistance provider is
 25 29 required to accept client referrals from the EDA as a condition
 25 30 of receiving a grant.  The division provides that the EDA may
 25 31 make client referrals to eligible providers.
 25 32    DIVISION IV ==== MISCELLANEOUS CHANGES.  Division IV makes
 25 33 several miscellaneous changes to other EDA programs.  The

 21 31 a combined amount of more than $100,000 in tax credits per tax
 21 32 year.
 21 33    The division also provides that no more than $500,000 in tax
 21 34 credits may be issued per tax year for equity investments in
 21 35 any one qualifying business.
 22  1 The division modifies the procedures for claiming the tax
 22  2 credit.  Under current law, the tax credit is not refundable
 22  3 but available for carryforward for up to five tax years.  The
 22  4 division makes the tax credit refundable for an investment
 22  5 made by a natural person, and for any other person reduces the
 22  6 carryforward period to three years.
 22  7    The division strikes a provision permitting the EDA
 22  8 to cooperate with small business development centers to
 22  9 disseminate information regarding the credits and to develop
 22 10 standard application forms, and requiring the EDA to distribute
 22 11 copies of the application forms to all community=based seed
 22 12 capital funds and potential individual investors.
 22 13    The division modifies the eligibility requirements for
 22 14 qualifying businesses.  The division strikes the requirement
 22 15 that a business have an owner that meets at least one of
 22 16 four qualifications relating to business education or
 22 17 business experience.  The division requires that a business
 22 18 be participating in an entrepreneurial assistance program,
 22 19 as defined in the division, but allows the EDA to waive this
 22 20 requirement if the business establishes that its owners,
 22 21 directors, officers, and employees have an appropriate level
 22 22 of experience such that an entrepreneurial assistance program
 22 23 would not materially change the prospects of the business.
 22 24 The EDA is allowed to consult with outside service providers
 22 25 in considering such a waiver.  The division increases from $5
 22 26 million to $10 million the maximum amount of net worth that
 22 27 a business may have to be considered a qualifying business.
 22 28 The division increases from $250,000 to $500,000 the amount of
 22 29 financing that a business must have in order to be considered a
 22 30 qualifying business, removes "near equity" from the types of
 22 31 financing that will be considered in that calculation, requires
 22 32 that the financing be secured at the time of application for
 22 33 the tax credits, and requires that the business have at least
 22 34 two investors at the time of application for the tax credits.
 22 35 These modified eligibility requirements apply to businesses
 23  1 that submit an application to the EDA to be registered as a
 23  2 qualifying business on or after the effective date of this
 23  3 division of the bill, and businesses that submitted such an
 23  4 application to the EDA before the effective date of this
 23  5 division of the bill shall be governed by current law.
 23  6    The division provides for the confidentiality of certain
 23  7 information with regard to the tax credit.  The identity of
 23  8 a qualifying business, the identity of an investor and the
 23  9 qualifying business in which the investor made an equity
 23 10 investment, and the total number and amount of tax credits
 23 11 issued shall be considered public information under Code
 23 12 chapter 22 (examination of public records), but any other
 23 13 information or record in the possession of the EDA with respect
 23 14 to the program shall be presumed by the EDA to be a trade secret
 23 15 protected under Code chapter 550 or common law and shall be
 23 16 kept confidential by the EDA unless otherwise ordered by a
 23 17 court.
 23 18    The division takes effect upon enactment and applies to
 23 19 equity investments in a qualifying business made on or after
 23 20 that date.  Equity investments in a qualifying business or
 23 21 community=based seed capital fund made prior to the effective
 23 22 date of the division shall be governed by current law.
 23 23    DIVISION III ==== ENTREPRENEUR INVESTMENT AWARDS PROGRAM.
 23 24  Division III amends the entrepreneur investment awards program
 23 25 administered by the EDA.  The division strikes provisions that
 23 26 prohibited the EDA from making awards under the program since
 23 27 July 1, 2014, and that required the EDA by December 31, 2014,
 23 28 to conduct a comprehensive review of the program and submit
 23 29 a report with specified information to the governor and the
 23 30 general assembly.
 23 31    The division modifies the purpose of the program to be
 23 32 to provide financial assistance to eligible entrepreneurial
 23 33 assistance providers (provider) that provide technical and
 23 34 financial assistance to entrepreneurs and start=up companies
 23 35 seeking to create, locate, or expand a business in Iowa.
 24  1 "Financial assistance" is defined in the division.
 24  2    The division changes the requirements for receiving an
 24  3 award.  To be eligible to receive an award under current
 24  4 law, an entrepreneurial assistance program must have been
 24  5 an Iowa=based business, expended at least $500,000 during
 24  6 the previous fiscal year to provide technical and financial
 24  7 assistance services that meet the broad=based needs of
 24  8 entrepreneurs seeking to create, locate, or expand a business
 24  9 in Iowa that intends to derive more than 10 percent of its
 24 10 gross sales from markets outside Iowa; and must have engaged
 24 11 and communicated with certain other programs, funding sources,
 24 12 and entities for its entrepreneur clients.  The division
 24 13 amends the eligibility for receiving financial assistance to
 24 14 require that a provider have its principal place of operations
 24 15 in Iowa and that the provider offer a comprehensive set of
 24 16 business development services to emerging and early=stage
 24 17 innovation companies to assist in the creation, location,
 24 18 growth, and long=term success of the company in Iowa.
 24 19 "Business development services" is defined in the division.
 24 20 Business development services may be performed at the physical
 24 21 location of the provider or the company and may be provided in
 24 22 consideration of equity participation in the company, a fee for
 24 23 services, or a membership agreement with the company.
 24 24    Under current law, the EDA board could approve, deny, or
 24 25 defer each application for a grant, and was required to award
 24 26 grants on a first=come, first=served basis.  The division
 24 27 specifies that the EDA board has the discretion to approve,
 24 28 deny, or defer each application for financial assistance and
 24 29 that the amount of financial assistance awarded to a provider
 24 30 is within the discretion of the EDA.  The division requires
 24 31 the EDA to award financial assistance on a competitive basis
 24 32 and allows the EDA to develop scoring criteria and establish
 24 33 minimum requirements for the receipt of a financial assistance
 24 34 award.
 24 35    In addition to the four factors relating to the provider's
 25  1 professional staff that the EDA may consider under current
 25  2 law in deciding whether to award financial assistance, the
 25  3 division provides that the EDA may also consider the service
 25  4 model and likelihood of success of the provider, the provider's
 25  5 similarity to other successful providers in the country, and
 25  6 the provider's financial need.
 25  7    The division modifies the maximum award amount for a
 25  8 recipient.  Under current law, a grant to an entrepreneur
 25  9 assistance program cannot exceed the lesser of 25 percent of
 25 10 the funds expended by the program during the previous fiscal
 25 11 year, 100 percent of the funds raised from certain persons
 25 12 by the program during the previous fiscal year, or $200,000.
 25 13 The division provides that the amount of financial assistance
 25 14 awarded to any one provider shall not exceed $200,000.
 25 15    The division modifies the permitted use of funds received
 25 16 under the program.  Under current law, grants are only
 25 17 permitted to be used for the purpose of operating costs
 25 18 incurred by the program.  The division specifies that financial
 25 19 assistance awarded to a provider shall only be used for
 25 20 the purpose of operating costs incurred by the provider in
 25 21 the provision of business development services to emerging
 25 22 and early=stage innovation companies in Iowa.  The division
 25 23 further requires that such financial assistance shall not be
 25 24 distributed to owners or investors of the company to which the
 25 25 business development services are being provided and shall not
 25 26 be provided to other persons assisting with the provision of
 25 27 the services.
 25 28    Under current law, an entrepreneurial assistance provider is
 25 29 required to accept client referrals from the EDA as a condition
 25 30 of receiving a grant.  The division provides that the EDA may
 25 31 make client referrals to eligible providers.
 25 32    DIVISION IV ==== MISCELLANEOUS CHANGES.  Division IV makes
 25 33 several miscellaneous changes to other EDA programs.  The
 25 34 division amends the sales and use tax refund available under
 25 35 the workforce housing tax incentive program.  That refund
 26  1 is available for sales and use tax paid prior to project
 26  2 completion, which is currently defined to mean the first date
 26  3 upon which the average annualized production of finished
 26  4 product for the preceding 90=day period at the manufacturing
 26  5 facility operated by the eligible business is at least 50
 26  6 percent of the initial design capacity of the facility.  The
 26  7 division amends the definition of "project completion" to mean
 26  8 the date on which the EDA notifies the department of revenue
 26  9 that all applicable requirements of a workforce housing tax
 26 10 incentive program agreement are satisfied.  This provision
 26 11 takes effect upon enactment and applies retroactively to July
 26 12 1, 2014, for all workforce housing tax incentive agreements
 26 13 entered into on or after that date.
 26 14    The division allows the EDA to extend the project
 26 15 completion date for a project awarded tax incentives under the
 26 16 redevelopment tax credit program and the housing enterprise
 26 17 zone tax incentives program if the property that is the subject
 26 18 of the project suffered a catastrophic fire during the 2014
 26 19 calendar year.
       LSB 1212HV (3) 86
       mm/sc
 20  9 election of the taxpayer, be carried forward for up to one tax
 20 10 year.   The tax credit shall not be transferred to any person.  A
 20 11 tax credit issued to a partnership, limited liability company,
 20 12 S corporation, cooperative organized under Code chapter 501
 20 13 and filing as a partnership for federal tax purposes, estate,
 20 14 or trust electing to have the income taxed directly to the
 20 15 individual may be claimed by the individual based upon the pro
 20 16 rata share of the individual's earnings from that entity.
 20 17    The division provides that the program is subject to the
 20 18 EDA's maximum aggregate tax credit cap of $170 million per
 20 19 fiscal year in Code section 15.119, and not more than $15
 20 20 million per fiscal year may be issued by the EDA under the
 20 21 program.  In addition, the maximum amount of tax credit that
 20 22 may be issued to an eligible business in any one calendar year
 20 23 shall not exceed $1 million or $500,000, depending on whether
 20 24 the eligible business has been operating in Iowa at the time of
 20 25 application for five or fewer years, or more than five years,
 20 26 respectively.  An eligible business shall not receive more than
 20 27 five tax credits under the program.  The EDA is required to
 20 28 issue tax credits on a first=come, first=served basis until the
 20 29 maximum amount of $15 million per fiscal year is reached.  If
 20 30 the amount of tax credits exceeds this amount in a fiscal year,
 20 31 the EDA is required to establish a wait list and give priority
 20 32 in subsequent years to the eligible businesses on the wait
 20 33 list.
 20 34    The division provides for the confidentiality of certain
 20 35 information under the program.  The identity of a tax credit
 21  1 recipient and the amount of the tax credit shall be considered
 21  2 public information under Code chapter 22 (examination of public
 21  3 records), but any other information or record in the possession
 21  4 of the EDA with respect to the program shall be presumed by
 21  5 the EDA to be a trade secret protected under Code chapter 550
 21  6 or common law and shall be kept confidential by the EDA unless
 21  7 otherwise ordered by a court.
 21  8    The division takes effect upon enactment and applies to
 21  9 renewable chemicals produced in Iowa from biomass feedstock on
 21 10 or after that date.  The division applies retroactively to tax
 21 11 years beginning on or after January 1, 2015.
 21 12    DIVISION II ==== ANGEL INVESTOR TAX CREDITS.   Division II
 21 13 makes several changes to the tax credit for investments in
 21 14 qualifying businesses and community=based seed capital funds,
 21 15 often referred to as the angel investor tax credits.  The
 21 16 division amends the purpose of the tax credit in Code section
 21 17 15E.41.  The division excludes investments in community=based
 21 18 seed capital funds from qualifying for the tax credit and
 21 19 makes several conforming amendments to remove references to
 21 20 community=based seed capital funds from the Code.
 21 21    The division modifies the amount and dollar limitation of
 21 22 the tax credit for a taxpayer.  The tax credit is increased
 21 23 from 20 percent to 25 percent of a taxpayer's equity investment
 21 24 in a qualifying business.  Under current law, a taxpayer cannot
 21 25 claim more than $50,000 of tax credit per investment in a
 21 26 qualifying business, and for each tax year a taxpayer and the
 21 27 taxpayer's affiliates cannot claim tax credits for more than
 21 28 five investments in five different qualifying businesses.  The
 21 29 division amends this dollar limitation to prohibit a natural
 21 30 person and the person's spouse, child, or sibling from claiming
 21 31 a combined amount of more than $100,000 in tax credits per tax
 21 32 year.
 21 33    The division also provides that no more than $500,000 in tax
 21 34 credits may be issued per tax year for equity investments in
 21 35 any one qualifying business.
 22  1 The division modifies the procedures for claiming the tax
 22  2 credit.  Under current law, the tax credit is not refundable
 22  3 but available for carryforward for up to five tax years.  The
 22  4 division makes the tax credit refundable for an investment
 22  5 made by a natural person, and for any other person reduces the
 22  6 carryforward period to three years.
 22  7    The division strikes a provision permitting the EDA
 22  8 to cooperate with small business development centers to
 22  9 disseminate information regarding the credits and to develop
 22 10 standard application forms, and requiring the EDA to distribute
 22 11 copies of the application forms to all community=based seed
 22 12 capital funds and potential individual investors.
 22 13    The division modifies the eligibility requirements for
 22 14 qualifying businesses.  The division strikes the requirement
 22 15 that a business have an owner that meets at least one of
 22 16 four qualifications relating to business education or
 22 17 business experience.  The division requires that a business
 22 18 be participating in an entrepreneurial assistance program,
 22 19 as defined in the division, but allows the EDA to waive this
 22 20 requirement if the business establishes that its owners,
 22 21 directors, officers, and employees have an appropriate level
 22 22 of experience such that an entrepreneurial assistance program
 22 23 would not materially change the prospects of the business.
 22 24 The EDA is allowed to consult with outside service providers
 22 25 in considering such a waiver.  The division increases from $5
 22 26 million to $10 million the maximum amount of net worth that
 22 27 a business may have to be considered a qualifying business.
 22 28 The division increases from $250,000 to $500,000 the amount of
 22 29 financing that a business must have in order to be considered a
 22 30 qualifying business, removes "near equity" from the types of
 22 31 financing that will be considered in that calculation, requires
 22 32 that the financing be secured at the time of application for
 22 33 the tax credits, and requires that the business have at least
 22 34 two investors at the time of application for the tax credits.
 22 35 These modified eligibility requirements apply to businesses
 23  1 that submit an application to the EDA to be registered as a
 23  2 qualifying business on or after the effective date of this
 23  3 division of the bill, and businesses that submitted such an
 23  4 application to the EDA before the effective date of this
 23  5 division of the bill shall be governed by current law.
 23  6    The division provides for the confidentiality of certain
 23  7 information with regard to the tax credit.  The identity of
 23  8 a qualifying business, the identity of an investor and the
 23  9 qualifying business in which the investor made an equity
 23 10 investment, and the total number and amount of tax credits
 23 11 issued shall be considered public information under Code
 23 12 chapter 22 (examination of public records), but any other
 23 13 information or record in the possession of the EDA with respect
 23 14 to the program shall be presumed by the EDA to be a trade secret
 23 15 protected under Code chapter 550 or common law and shall be
 23 16 kept confidential by the EDA unless otherwise ordered by a
 23 17 court.
 23 18    The division takes effect upon enactment and applies to
 23 19 equity investments in a qualifying business made on or after
 23 20 that date.  Equity investments in a qualifying business or
 23 21 community=based seed capital fund made prior to the effective
 23 22 date of the division shall be governed by current law.
 23 23    DIVISION III ==== ENTREPRENEUR INVESTMENT AWARDS PROGRAM.
 23 24  Division III amends the entrepreneur investment awards program
 23 25 administered by the EDA.  The division strikes provisions that
 23 26 prohibited the EDA from making awards under the program since
 23 27 July 1, 2014, and that required the EDA by December 31, 2014,
 23 28 to conduct a comprehensive review of the program and submit
 23 29 a report with specified information to the governor and the
 23 30 general assembly.
 23 31    The division modifies the purpose of the program to be
 23 32 to provide financial assistance to eligible entrepreneurial
 23 33 assistance providers (provider) that provide technical and
 23 34 financial assistance to entrepreneurs and start=up companies
 23 35 seeking to create, locate, or expand a business in Iowa.
 24  1 "Financial assistance" is defined in the division.
 24  2    The division changes the requirements for receiving an
 24  3 award.  To be eligible to receive an award under current
 24  4 law, an entrepreneurial assistance program must have been
 24  5 an Iowa=based business, expended at least $500,000 during
 24  6 the previous fiscal year to provide technical and financial
 24  7 assistance services that meet the broad=based needs of

 24  9 in Iowa that intends to derive more than 10 percent of its
 24 10 gross sales from markets outside Iowa; and must have engaged
 24 11 and communicated with certain other programs, funding sources,
 24 12 and entities for its entrepreneur clients.  The division
 24 13 amends the eligibility for receiving financial assistance to
 24 14 require that a provider have its principal place of operations
 24 15 in Iowa and that the provider offer a comprehensive set of
 24 16 business development services to emerging and early=stage
 24 17 innovation companies to assist in the creation, location,
 24 18 growth, and long=term success of the company in Iowa.
 24 19 "Business development services" is defined in the division.
 24 20 Business development services may be performed at the physical
 24 21 location of the provider or the company and may be provided in
 24 22 consideration of equity participation in the company, a fee for
 24 23 services, or a membership agreement with the company.
 24 24    Under current law, the EDA board could approve, deny, or
 24 25 defer each application for a grant, and was required to award
 24 26 grants on a first=come, first=served basis.  The division
 24 27 specifies that the EDA board has the discretion to approve,
 24 28 deny, or defer each application for financial assistance and
 24 29 that the amount of financial assistance awarded to a provider
 24 30 is within the discretion of the EDA.  The division requires
 24 31 the EDA to award financial assistance on a competitive basis
 24 32 and allows the EDA to develop scoring criteria and establish
 24 33 minimum requirements for the receipt of a financial assistance
 24 34 award.
 24 35    In addition to the four factors relating to the provider's
 25  1 professional staff that the EDA may consider under current
 25  2 law in deciding whether to award financial assistance, the
 25  3 division provides that the EDA may also consider the service
 25  4 model and likelihood of success of the provider, the provider's
 25  5 similarity to other successful providers in the country, and
 25  6 the provider's financial need.
 25  7    The division modifies the maximum award amount for a
 25  8 recipient.  Under current law, a grant to an entrepreneur
 25  9 assistance program cannot exceed the lesser of 25 percent of
 25 10 the funds expended by the program during the previous fiscal
 25 11 year, 100 percent of the funds raised from certain persons
 25 12 by the program during the previous fiscal year, or $200,000.
 25 13 The division provides that the amount of financial assistance
 25 14 awarded to any one provider shall not exceed $200,000.
 25 15    The division modifies the permitted use of funds received
 25 16 under the program.  Under current law, grants are only
 25 17 permitted to be used for the purpose of operating costs
 25 18 incurred by the program.  The division specifies that financial
 25 19 assistance awarded to a provider shall only be used for
 25 20 the purpose of operating costs incurred by the provider in
 25 21 the provision of business development services to emerging
 25 22 and early=stage innovation companies in Iowa.  The division
 25 23 further requires that such financial assistance shall not be
 25 24 distributed to owners or investors of the company to which the
 25 25 business development services are being provided and shall not
 25 26 be provided to other persons assisting with the provision of
 25 27 the services.
 25 28    Under current law, an entrepreneurial assistance provider is
 25 29 required to accept client referrals from the EDA as a condition
 25 30 of receiving a grant.  The division provides that the EDA may
 25 31 make client referrals to eligible providers.
 25 32    DIVISION IV ==== MISCELLANEOUS CHANGES.  Division IV makes
 25 33 several miscellaneous changes to other EDA programs.  The
 25 34 division amends the sales and use tax refund available under
 25 35 the workforce housing tax incentive program.  That refund
 26  1 is available for sales and use tax paid prior to project
 26  2 completion, which is currently defined to mean the first date
 26  3 upon which the average annualized production of finished
 26  4 product for the preceding 90=day period at the manufacturing
 26  5 facility operated by the eligible business is at least 50
 26  6 percent of the initial design capacity of the facility.  The
 26  7 division amends the definition of "project completion" to mean
 26  8 the date on which the EDA notifies the department of revenue
 26  9 that all applicable requirements of a workforce housing tax
 26 10 incentive program agreement are satisfied.  This provision
 26 11 takes effect upon enactment and applies retroactively to July

 20 13 and filing as a partnership for federal tax purposes, estate,
 20 14 or trust electing to have the income taxed directly to the

 20 19 fiscal year in Code section 15.119, and not more than $15
 20 20 million per fiscal year may be issued by the EDA under the
 20 21 program.  In addition, the maximum amount of tax credit that
 20 22 may be issued to an eligible business in any one calendar year
 20 23 shall not exceed $1 million or $500,000, depending on whether
 20 24 the eligible business has been operating in Iowa at the time of
 20 25 application for five or fewer years, or more than five years,
 20 26 respectively.  An eligible business shall not receive more than
 20 27 five tax credits under the program.  The EDA is required to
 20 28 issue tax credits on a first=come, first=served basis until the

 20 32 in subsequent years to the eligible businesses on the wait
 20 33 list.
 20 34    The division provides for the confidentiality of certain
 20 35 information under the program.  The identity of a tax credit
 21  1 recipient and the amount of the tax credit shall be considered
 21  2 public information under Code chapter 22 (examination of public
 21  3 records), but any other information or record in the possession
 21  4 of the EDA with respect to the program shall be presumed by
 21  5 the EDA to be a trade secret protected under Code chapter 550
 21  6 or common law and shall be kept confidential by the EDA unless
 21  7 otherwise ordered by a court.
 21  8    The division takes effect upon enactment and applies to

 21 10 or after that date.  The division applies retroactively to tax
 21 11 years beginning on or after January 1, 2015.
 21 12    DIVISION II ==== ANGEL INVESTOR TAX CREDITS.   Division II
 21 13 makes several changes to the tax credit for investments in
 21 14 qualifying businesses and community=based seed capital funds,
 21 15 often referred to as the angel investor tax credits.  The
 21 16 division amends the purpose of the tax credit in Code section
 21 17 15E.41.  The division excludes investments in community=based
 21 18 seed capital funds from qualifying for the tax credit and
 21 19 makes several conforming amendments to remove references to
 21 20 community=based seed capital funds from the Code.
 21 21    The division modifies the amount and dollar limitation of
 21 22 the tax credit for a taxpayer.  The tax credit is increased
 21 23 from 20 percent to 25 percent of a taxpayer's equity investment
 21 24 in a qualifying business.  Under current law, a taxpayer cannot
 21 25 claim more than $50,000 of tax credit per investment in a
 21 26 qualifying business, and for each tax year a taxpayer and the
 21 27 taxpayer's affiliates cannot claim tax credits for more than
 21 28 five investments in five different qualifying businesses.  The
 21 29 division amends this dollar limitation to prohibit a natural
 21 30 person and the person's spouse, child, or sibling from claiming
 21 31 a combined amount of more than $100,000 in tax credits per tax
 21 32 year.
 21 33    The division also provides that no more than $500,000 in tax
 21 34 credits may be issued per tax year for equity investments in
 21 35 any one qualifying business.
 22  1 The division modifies the procedures for claiming the tax
 22  2 credit.  Under current law, the tax credit is not refundable
 22  3 but available for carryforward for up to five tax years.  The
 22  4 division makes the tax credit refundable for an investment
 22  5 made by a natural person, and for any other person reduces the
 22  6 carryforward period to three years.
 22  7    The division strikes a provision permitting the EDA
 22  8 to cooperate with small business development centers to
 22  9 disseminate information regarding the credits and to develop
 22 10 standard application forms, and requiring the EDA to distribute
 22 11 copies of the application forms to all community=based seed
 22 12 capital funds and potential individual investors.
 22 13    The division modifies the eligibility requirements for
 22 14 qualifying businesses.  The division strikes the requirement
 22 15 that a business have an owner that meets at least one of
 22 16 four qualifications relating to business education or
 22 17 business experience.  The division requires that a business
 22 18 be participating in an entrepreneurial assistance program,
 22 19 as defined in the division, but allows the EDA to waive this
 22 20 requirement if the business establishes that its owners,
 22 21 directors, officers, and employees have an appropriate level
 22 22 of experience such that an entrepreneurial assistance program
 22 23 would not materially change the prospects of the business.
 22 24 The EDA is allowed to consult with outside service providers
 22 25 in considering such a waiver.  The division increases from $5
 22 26 million to $10 million the maximum amount of net worth that
 22 27 a business may have to be considered a qualifying business.
 22 28 The division increases from $250,000 to $500,000 the amount of
 22 29 financing that a business must have in order to be considered a
 22 30 qualifying business, removes "near equity" from the types of
 22 31 financing that will be considered in that calculation, requires
 22 32 that the financing be secured at the time of application for
 22 33 the tax credits, and requires that the business have at least
 22 34 two investors at the time of application for the tax credits.
 22 35 These modified eligibility requirements apply to businesses
 23  1 that submit an application to the EDA to be registered as a
 23  2 qualifying business on or after the effective date of this
 23  3 division of the bill, and businesses that submitted such an
 23  4 application to the EDA before the effective date of this
 23  5 division of the bill shall be governed by current law.
 23  6    The division provides for the confidentiality of certain
 23  7 information with regard to the tax credit.  The identity of
 23  8 a qualifying business, the identity of an investor and the
 23  9 qualifying business in which the investor made an equity
 23 10 investment, and the total number and amount of tax credits
 23 11 issued shall be considered public information under Code
 23 12 chapter 22 (examination of public records), but any other
 23 13 information or record in the possession of the EDA with respect
 23 14 to the program shall be presumed by the EDA to be a trade secret
 23 15 protected under Code chapter 550 or common law and shall be
 23 16 kept confidential by the EDA unless otherwise ordered by a
 23 17 court.
 23 18    The division takes effect upon enactment and applies to
 23 19 equity investments in a qualifying business made on or after
 23 20 that date.  Equity investments in a qualifying business or
 23 21 community=based seed capital fund made prior to the effective
 23 22 date of the division shall be governed by current law.
 23 23    DIVISION III ==== ENTREPRENEUR INVESTMENT AWARDS PROGRAM.
 23 24  Division III amends the entrepreneur investment awards program
 23 25 administered by the EDA.  The division strikes provisions that
 23 26 prohibited the EDA from making awards under the program since
 23 27 July 1, 2014, and that required the EDA by December 31, 2014,
 23 28 to conduct a comprehensive review of the program and submit
 23 29 a report with specified information to the governor and the
 23 30 general assembly.
 23 31    The division modifies the purpose of the program to be
 23 32 to provide financial assistance to eligible entrepreneurial
 23 33 assistance providers (provider) that provide technical and
 23 34 financial assistance to entrepreneurs and start=up companies
 23 35 seeking to create, locate, or expand a business in Iowa.
 24  1 "Financial assistance" is defined in the division.
 24  2    The division changes the requirements for receiving an
 24  3 award.  To be eligible to receive an award under current
 24  4 law, an entrepreneurial assistance program must have been
 24  5 an Iowa=based business, expended at least $500,000 during
 24  6 the previous fiscal year to provide technical and financial
 24  7 assistance services that meet the broad=based needs of
 24  8 entrepreneurs seeking to create, locate, or expand a business
 24  9 in Iowa that intends to derive more than 10 percent of its
 24 10 gross sales from markets outside Iowa; and must have engaged
 24 11 and communicated with certain other programs, funding sources,
 24 12 and entities for its entrepreneur clients.  The division
 24 13 amends the eligibility for receiving financial assistance to
 24 14 require that a provider have its principal place of operations
 24 15 in Iowa and that the provider offer a comprehensive set of
 24 16 business development services to emerging and early=stage
 24 17 innovation companies to assist in the creation, location,
 24 18 growth, and long=term success of the company in Iowa.
 24 19 "Business development services" is defined in the division.
 24 20 Business development services may be performed at the physical
 24 21 location of the provider or the company and may be provided in
 24 22 consideration of equity participation in the company, a fee for
 24 23 services, or a membership agreement with the company.
 24 24    Under current law, the EDA board could approve, deny, or
 24 25 defer each application for a grant, and was required to award
 24 26 grants on a first=come, first=served basis.  The division
 24 27 specifies that the EDA board has the discretion to approve,
 24 28 deny, or defer each application for financial assistance and
 24 29 that the amount of financial assistance awarded to a provider
 24 30 is within the discretion of the EDA.  The division requires
 24 31 the EDA to award financial assistance on a competitive basis
 24 32 and allows the EDA to develop scoring criteria and establish
 24 33 minimum requirements for the receipt of a financial assistance
 24 34 award.
 24 35    In addition to the four factors relating to the provider's
 25  1 professional staff that the EDA may consider under current
 25  2 law in deciding whether to award financial assistance, the
 25  3 division provides that the EDA may also consider the service
 25  4 model and likelihood of success of the provider, the provider's
 25  5 similarity to other successful providers in the country, and
 25  6 the provider's financial need.
 25  7    The division modifies the maximum award amount for a
 25  8 recipient.  Under current law, a grant to an entrepreneur
 25  9 assistance program cannot exceed the lesser of 25 percent of
 25 10 the funds expended by the program during the previous fiscal
 25 11 year, 100 percent of the funds raised from certain persons
 25 12 by the program during the previous fiscal year, or $200,000.
 25 13 The division provides that the amount of financial assistance
 25 14 awarded to any one provider shall not exceed $200,000.
 25 15    The division modifies the permitted use of funds received
 25 16 under the program.  Under current law, grants are only
 25 17 permitted to be used for the purpose of operating costs
 25 18 incurred by the program.  The division specifies that financial
 25 19 assistance awarded to a provider shall only be used for
 25 20 the purpose of operating costs incurred by the provider in
 25 21 the provision of business development services to emerging
 25 22 and early=stage innovation companies in Iowa.  The division
 25 23 further requires that such financial assistance shall not be
 25 24 distributed to owners or investors of the company to which the
 25 25 business development services are being provided and shall not
 25 26 be provided to other persons assisting with the provision of
 25 27 the services.
 25 28    Under current law, an entrepreneurial assistance provider is
 25 29 required to accept client referrals from the EDA as a condition
 25 30 of receiving a grant.  The division provides that the EDA may
 25 31 make client referrals to eligible providers.
 25 32    DIVISION IV ==== MISCELLANEOUS CHANGES.  Division IV makes
 25 33 several miscellaneous changes to other EDA programs.  The
 25 34 division amends the sales and use tax refund available under
 25 35 the workforce housing tax incentive program.  That refund
 26  1 is available for sales and use tax paid prior to project
 26  2 completion, which is currently defined to mean the first date
 26  3 upon which the average annualized production of finished
 26  4 product for the preceding 90=day period at the manufacturing
 26  5 facility operated by the eligible business is at least 50
 26  6 percent of the initial design capacity of the facility.  The
 26  7 division amends the definition of "project completion" to mean
 26  8 the date on which the EDA notifies the department of revenue
 26  9 that all applicable requirements of a workforce housing tax
 26 10 incentive program agreement are satisfied.  This provision
 26 11 takes effect upon enactment and applies retroactively to July
 26 12 1, 2014, for all workforce housing tax incentive agreements
 26 13 entered into on or after that date.
 26 14    The division allows the EDA to extend the project
 26 15 completion date for a project awarded tax incentives under the
 26 16 redevelopment tax credit program and the housing enterprise
 26 17 zone tax incentives program if the property that is the subject
 26 18 of the project suffered a catastrophic fire during the 2014
 26 19 calendar year.

 20 13 and filing as a partnership for federal tax purposes, estate,
 20 14 or trust electing to have the income taxed directly to the
 20 15 individual may be claimed by the individual based upon the pro
 20 16 rata share of the individual's earnings from that entity.
 20 17    The division provides that the program is subject to the
 20 18 EDA's maximum aggregate tax credit cap of $170 million per
 20 19 fiscal year in Code section 15.119, and not more than $15
 20 20 million per fiscal year may be issued by the EDA under the
 20 21 program.  In addition, the maximum amount of tax credit that
 20 22 may be issued to an eligible business in any one calendar year
 20 23 shall not exceed $1 million or $500,000, depending on whether
 20 24 the eligible business has been operating in Iowa at the time of
 20 25 application for five or fewer years, or more than five years,
 20 26 respectively.  An eligible business shall not receive more than
 20 27 five tax credits under the program.  The EDA is required to
 20 28 issue tax credits on a first=come, first=served basis until the
 20 29 maximum amount of $15 million per fiscal year is reached.  If
 20 30 the amount of tax credits exceeds this amount in a fiscal year,
 20 31 the EDA is required to establish a wait list and give priority
 20 32 in subsequent years to the eligible businesses on the wait
 20 33 list.
 20 34    The division provides for the confidentiality of certain
 20 35 information under the program.  The identity of a tax credit
 21  1 recipient and the amount of the tax credit shall be considered
 21  2 public information under Code chapter 22 (examination of public
 21  3 records), but any other information or record in the possession
 21  4 of the EDA with respect to the program shall be presumed by
 21  5 the EDA to be a trade secret protected under Code chapter 550
 21  6 or common law and shall be kept confidential by the EDA unless
 21  7 otherwise ordered by a court.
 21  8    The division takes effect upon enactment and applies to
 21  9 renewable chemicals produced in Iowa from biomass feedstock on
 21 10 or after that date.  The division applies retroactively to tax
 21 11 years beginning on or after January 1, 2015.
 21 12    DIVISION II ==== ANGEL INVESTOR TAX CREDITS.   Division II
 21 13 makes several changes to the tax credit for investments in
 21 14 qualifying businesses and community=based seed capital funds,
 21 15 often referred to as the angel investor tax credits.  The
 21 16 division amends the purpose of the tax credit in Code section
 21 17 15E.41.  The division excludes investments in community=based
 21 18 seed capital funds from qualifying for the tax credit and
 21 19 makes several conforming amendments to remove references to
 21 20 community=based seed capital funds from the Code.
 21 21    The division modifies the amount and dollar limitation of
 21 22 the tax credit for a taxpayer.  The tax credit is increased
 21 23 from 20 percent to 25 percent of a taxpayer's equity investment
 21 24 in a qualifying business.  Under current law, a taxpayer cannot
 21 25 claim more than $50,000 of tax credit per investment in a
 21 26 qualifying business, and for each tax year a taxpayer and the
 21 27 taxpayer's affiliates cannot claim tax credits for more than
 21 28 five investments in five different qualifying businesses.  The
 21 29 division amends this dollar limitation to prohibit a natural
 21 30 person and the person's spouse, child, or sibling from claiming
 21 31 a combined amount of more than $100,000 in tax credits per tax
 21 32 year.
 21 33    The division also provides that no more than $500,000 in tax
 21 34 credits may be issued per tax year for equity investments in
 21 35 any one qualifying business.
 22  1 The division modifies the procedures for claiming the tax
 22  2 credit.  Under current law, the tax credit is not refundable
 22  3 but available for carryforward for up to five tax years.  The
 22  4 division makes the tax credit refundable for an investment
 22  5 made by a natural person, and for any other person reduces the
 22  6 carryforward period to three years.
 22  7    The division strikes a provision permitting the EDA
 22  8 to cooperate with small business development centers to
 22  9 disseminate information regarding the credits and to develop
 22 10 standard application forms, and requiring the EDA to distribute
 22 11 copies of the application forms to all community=based seed
 22 12 capital funds and potential individual investors.
 22 13    The division modifies the eligibility requirements for
 22 14 qualifying businesses.  The division strikes the requirement
 22 15 that a business have an owner that meets at least one of
 22 16 four qualifications relating to business education or
 22 17 business experience.  The division requires that a business
 22 18 be participating in an entrepreneurial assistance program,
 22 19 as defined in the division, but allows the EDA to waive this
 22 20 requirement if the business establishes that its owners,
 22 21 directors, officers, and employees have an appropriate level
 22 22 of experience such that an entrepreneurial assistance program
 22 23 would not materially change the prospects of the business.
 22 24 The EDA is allowed to consult with outside service providers
 22 25 in considering such a waiver.  The division increases from $5
 22 26 million to $10 million the maximum amount of net worth that
 22 27 a business may have to be considered a qualifying business.
 22 28 The division increases from $250,000 to $500,000 the amount of
 22 29 financing that a business must have in order to be considered a
 22 30 qualifying business, removes "near equity" from the types of
 22 31 financing that will be considered in that calculation, requires
 22 32 that the financing be secured at the time of application for
 22 33 the tax credits, and requires that the business have at least
 22 34 two investors at the time of application for the tax credits.
 22 35 These modified eligibility requirements apply to businesses
 23  1 that submit an application to the EDA to be registered as a
 23  2 qualifying business on or after the effective date of this
 23  3 division of the bill, and businesses that submitted such an
 23  4 application to the EDA before the effective date of this
 23  5 division of the bill shall be governed by current law.
 23  6    The division provides for the confidentiality of certain
 23  7 information with regard to the tax credit.  The identity of
 23  8 a qualifying business, the identity of an investor and the
 23  9 qualifying business in which the investor made an equity
 23 10 investment, and the total number and amount of tax credits
 23 11 issued shall be considered public information under Code
 23 12 chapter 22 (examination of public records), but any other
 23 13 information or record in the possession of the EDA with respect
 23 14 to the program shall be presumed by the EDA to be a trade secret
 23 15 protected under Code chapter 550 or common law and shall be
 23 16 kept confidential by the EDA unless otherwise ordered by a
 23 17 court.
 23 18    The division takes effect upon enactment and applies to
 23 19 equity investments in a qualifying business made on or after
 23 20 that date.  Equity investments in a qualifying business or
 23 21 community=based seed capital fund made prior to the effective
 23 22 date of the division shall be governed by current law.
 23 23    DIVISION III ==== ENTREPRENEUR INVESTMENT AWARDS PROGRAM.
 23 24  Division III amends the entrepreneur investment awards program
 23 25 administered by the EDA.  The division strikes provisions that
 23 26 prohibited the EDA from making awards under the program since
 23 27 July 1, 2014, and that required the EDA by December 31, 2014,
 23 28 to conduct a comprehensive review of the program and submit
 23 29 a report with specified information to the governor and the
 23 30 general assembly.
 23 31    The division modifies the purpose of the program to be
 23 32 to provide financial assistance to eligible entrepreneurial
 23 33 assistance providers (provider) that provide technical and
 23 34 financial assistance to entrepreneurs and start=up companies
 23 35 seeking to create, locate, or expand a business in Iowa.
 24  1 "Financial assistance" is defined in the division.
 24  2    The division changes the requirements for receiving an

 24 10 gross sales from markets outside Iowa; and must have engaged
 24 11 and communicated with certain other programs, funding sources,
 24 12 and entities for its entrepreneur clients.  The division
 24 13 amends the eligibility for receiving financial assistance to
 24 14 require that a provider have its principal place of operations
 24 15 in Iowa and that the provider offer a comprehensive set of
 24 16 business development services to emerging and early=stage
 24 17 innovation companies to assist in the creation, location,
 24 18 growth, and long=term success of the company in Iowa.
 24 19 "Business development services" is defined in the division.
 24 20 Business development services may be performed at the physical
 24 21 location of the provider or the company and may be provided in
 24 22 consideration of equity participation in the company, a fee for
 24 23 services, or a membership agreement with the company.
 24 24    Under current law, the EDA board could approve, deny, or
 24 25 defer each application for a grant, and was required to award
 24 26 grants on a first=come, first=served basis.  The division
 24 27 specifies that the EDA board has the discretion to approve,
 24 28 deny, or defer each application for financial assistance and
 24 29 that the amount of financial assistance awarded to a provider
 24 30 is within the discretion of the EDA.  The division requires
 24 31 the EDA to award financial assistance on a competitive basis
 24 32 and allows the EDA to develop scoring criteria and establish
 24 33 minimum requirements for the receipt of a financial assistance
 24 34 award.
 24 35    In addition to the four factors relating to the provider's
 25  1 professional staff that the EDA may consider under current
 25  2 law in deciding whether to award financial assistance, the
 25  3 division provides that the EDA may also consider the service
 25  4 model and likelihood of success of the provider, the provider's
 25  5 similarity to other successful providers in the country, and
 25  6 the provider's financial need.
 25  7    The division modifies the maximum award amount for a
 25  8 recipient.  Under current law, a grant to an entrepreneur
 25  9 assistance program cannot exceed the lesser of 25 percent of
 25 10 the funds expended by the program during the previous fiscal
 25 11 year, 100 percent of the funds raised from certain persons
 25 12 by the program during the previous fiscal year, or $200,000.
 25 13 The division provides that the amount of financial assistance
 25 14 awarded to any one provider shall not exceed $200,000.
 25 15    The division modifies the permitted use of funds received
 25 16 under the program.  Under current law, grants are only
 25 17 permitted to be used for the purpose of operating costs
 25 18 incurred by the program.  The division specifies that financial
 25 19 assistance awarded to a provider shall only be used for
 25 20 the purpose of operating costs incurred by the provider in
 25 21 the provision of business development services to emerging
 25 22 and early=stage innovation companies in Iowa.  The division
 25 23 further requires that such financial assistance shall not be
 25 24 distributed to owners or investors of the company to which the
 25 25 business development services are being provided and shall not
 25 26 be provided to other persons assisting with the provision of
 25 27 the services.
 25 28    Under current law, an entrepreneurial assistance provider is
 25 29 required to accept client referrals from the EDA as a condition
 25 30 of receiving a grant.  The division provides that the EDA may
 25 31 make client referrals to eligible providers.
 25 32    DIVISION IV ==== MISCELLANEOUS CHANGES.  Division IV makes
 25 33 several miscellaneous changes to other EDA programs.  The
 25 34 division amends the sales and use tax refund available under
 25 35 the workforce housing tax incentive program.  That refund
 26  1 is available for sales and use tax paid prior to project
 26  2 completion, which is currently defined to mean the first date
 26  3 upon which the average annualized production of finished
 26  4 product for the preceding 90=day period at the manufacturing
 26  5 facility operated by the eligible business is at least 50

 26  7 division amends the definition of "project completion" to mean
 26  8 the date on which the EDA notifies the department of revenue
 26  9 that all applicable requirements of a workforce housing tax
 26 10 incentive program agreement are satisfied.  This provision
 26 11 takes effect upon enactment and applies retroactively to July

 20 34    The division provides for the confidentiality of certain
 20 35 information under the program.  The identity of a tax credit
 21  1 recipient and the amount of the tax credit shall be considered
 21  2 public information under Code chapter 22 (examination of public
 21  3 records), but any other information or record in the possession
 21  4 of the EDA with respect to the program shall be presumed by
 21  5 the EDA to be a trade secret protected under Code chapter 550
 21  6 or common law and shall be kept confidential by the EDA unless
 21  7 otherwise ordered by a court.
 21  8    The division takes effect upon enactment and applies to
 21  9 renewable chemicals produced in Iowa from biomass feedstock on
 21 10 or after that date.  The division applies retroactively to tax
 21 11 years beginning on or after January 1, 2015.
 21 12    DIVISION II ==== ANGEL INVESTOR TAX CREDITS.   Division II
 21 13 makes several changes to the tax credit for investments in
 21 14 qualifying businesses and community=based seed capital funds,
 21 15 often referred to as the angel investor tax credits.  The
 21 16 division amends the purpose of the tax credit in Code section
 21 17 15E.41.  The division excludes investments in community=based
 21 18 seed capital funds from qualifying for the tax credit and
 21 19 makes several conforming amendments to remove references to
 21 20 community=based seed capital funds from the Code.
 21 21    The division modifies the amount and dollar limitation of
 21 22 the tax credit for a taxpayer.  The tax credit is increased
 21 23 from 20 percent to 25 percent of a taxpayer's equity investment
 21 24 in a qualifying business.  Under current law, a taxpayer cannot
 21 25 claim more than $50,000 of tax credit per investment in a
 21 26 qualifying business, and for each tax year a taxpayer and the
 21 27 taxpayer's affiliates cannot claim tax credits for more than
 21 28 five investments in five different qualifying businesses.  The
 21 29 division amends this dollar limitation to prohibit a natural
 21 30 person and the person's spouse, child, or sibling from claiming
 21 31 a combined amount of more than $100,000 in tax credits per tax
 21 32 year.
 21 33    The division also provides that no more than $500,000 in tax
 21 34 credits may be issued per tax year for equity investments in
 21 35 any one qualifying business.
 22  1 The division modifies the procedures for claiming the tax
 22  2 credit.  Under current law, the tax credit is not refundable
 22  3 but available for carryforward for up to five tax years.  The
 22  4 division makes the tax credit refundable for an investment
 22  5 made by a natural person, and for any other person reduces the
 22  6 carryforward period to three years.
 22  7    The division strikes a provision permitting the EDA
 22  8 to cooperate with small business development centers to
 22  9 disseminate information regarding the credits and to develop
 22 10 standard application forms, and requiring the EDA to distribute
 22 11 copies of the application forms to all community=based seed
 22 12 capital funds and potential individual investors.
 22 13    The division modifies the eligibility requirements for
 22 14 qualifying businesses.  The division strikes the requirement
 22 15 that a business have an owner that meets at least one of
 22 16 four qualifications relating to business education or
 22 17 business experience.  The division requires that a business
 22 18 be participating in an entrepreneurial assistance program,
 22 19 as defined in the division, but allows the EDA to waive this
 22 20 requirement if the business establishes that its owners,
 22 21 directors, officers, and employees have an appropriate level
 22 22 of experience such that an entrepreneurial assistance program
 22 23 would not materially change the prospects of the business.
 22 24 The EDA is allowed to consult with outside service providers
 22 25 in considering such a waiver.  The division increases from $5
 22 26 million to $10 million the maximum amount of net worth that
 22 27 a business may have to be considered a qualifying business.
 22 28 The division increases from $250,000 to $500,000 the amount of
 22 29 financing that a business must have in order to be considered a
 22 30 qualifying business, removes "near equity" from the types of
 22 31 financing that will be considered in that calculation, requires
 22 32 that the financing be secured at the time of application for
 22 33 the tax credits, and requires that the business have at least
 22 34 two investors at the time of application for the tax credits.
 22 35 These modified eligibility requirements apply to businesses
 23  1 that submit an application to the EDA to be registered as a
 23  2 qualifying business on or after the effective date of this
 23  3 division of the bill, and businesses that submitted such an
 23  4 application to the EDA before the effective date of this
 23  5 division of the bill shall be governed by current law.
 23  6    The division provides for the confidentiality of certain
 23  7 information with regard to the tax credit.  The identity of
 23  8 a qualifying business, the identity of an investor and the
 23  9 qualifying business in which the investor made an equity
 23 10 investment, and the total number and amount of tax credits
 23 11 issued shall be considered public information under Code
 23 12 chapter 22 (examination of public records), but any other
 23 13 information or record in the possession of the EDA with respect
 23 14 to the program shall be presumed by the EDA to be a trade secret
 23 15 protected under Code chapter 550 or common law and shall be
 23 16 kept confidential by the EDA unless otherwise ordered by a
 23 17 court.
 23 18    The division takes effect upon enactment and applies to
 23 19 equity investments in a qualifying business made on or after
 23 20 that date.  Equity investments in a qualifying business or
 23 21 community=based seed capital fund made prior to the effective
 23 22 date of the division shall be governed by current law.
 23 23    DIVISION III ==== ENTREPRENEUR INVESTMENT AWARDS PROGRAM.
 23 24  Division III amends the entrepreneur investment awards program
 23 25 administered by the EDA.  The division strikes provisions that
 23 26 prohibited the EDA from making awards under the program since
 23 27 July 1, 2014, and that required the EDA by December 31, 2014,
 23 28 to conduct a comprehensive review of the program and submit
 23 29 a report with specified information to the governor and the
 23 30 general assembly.
 23 31    The division modifies the purpose of the program to be
 23 32 to provide financial assistance to eligible entrepreneurial
 23 33 assistance providers (provider) that provide technical and
 23 34 financial assistance to entrepreneurs and start=up companies
 23 35 seeking to create, locate, or expand a business in Iowa.
 24  1 "Financial assistance" is defined in the division.
 24  2    The division changes the requirements for receiving an
 24  3 award.  To be eligible to receive an award under current
 24  4 law, an entrepreneurial assistance program must have been
 24  5 an Iowa=based business, expended at least $500,000 during
 24  6 the previous fiscal year to provide technical and financial
 24  7 assistance services that meet the broad=based needs of
 24  8 entrepreneurs seeking to create, locate, or expand a business
 24  9 in Iowa that intends to derive more than 10 percent of its
 24 10 gross sales from markets outside Iowa; and must have engaged
 24 11 and communicated with certain other programs, funding sources,
 24 12 and entities for its entrepreneur clients.  The division
 24 13 amends the eligibility for receiving financial assistance to
 24 14 require that a provider have its principal place of operations
 24 15 in Iowa and that the provider offer a comprehensive set of
 24 16 business development services to emerging and early=stage
 24 17 innovation companies to assist in the creation, location,
 24 18 growth, and long=term success of the company in Iowa.
 24 19 "Business development services" is defined in the division.
 24 20 Business development services may be performed at the physical
 24 21 location of the provider or the company and may be provided in
 24 22 consideration of equity participation in the company, a fee for
 24 23 services, or a membership agreement with the company.
 24 24    Under current law, the EDA board could approve, deny, or
 24 25 defer each application for a grant, and was required to award
 24 26 grants on a first=come, first=served basis.  The division
 24 27 specifies that the EDA board has the discretion to approve,
 24 28 deny, or defer each application for financial assistance and
 24 29 that the amount of financial assistance awarded to a provider
 24 30 is within the discretion of the EDA.  The division requires
 24 31 the EDA to award financial assistance on a competitive basis
 24 32 and allows the EDA to develop scoring criteria and establish
 24 33 minimum requirements for the receipt of a financial assistance
 24 34 award.
 24 35    In addition to the four factors relating to the provider's
 25  1 professional staff that the EDA may consider under current
 25  2 law in deciding whether to award financial assistance, the
 25  3 division provides that the EDA may also consider the service
 25  4 model and likelihood of success of the provider, the provider's
 25  5 similarity to other successful providers in the country, and
 25  6 the provider's financial need.
 25  7    The division modifies the maximum award amount for a
 25  8 recipient.  Under current law, a grant to an entrepreneur
 25  9 assistance program cannot exceed the lesser of 25 percent of
 25 10 the funds expended by the program during the previous fiscal
 25 11 year, 100 percent of the funds raised from certain persons
 25 12 by the program during the previous fiscal year, or $200,000.
 25 13 The division provides that the amount of financial assistance
 25 14 awarded to any one provider shall not exceed $200,000.
 25 15    The division modifies the permitted use of funds received
 25 16 under the program.  Under current law, grants are only
 25 17 permitted to be used for the purpose of operating costs
 25 18 incurred by the program.  The division specifies that financial
 25 19 assistance awarded to a provider shall only be used for
 25 20 the purpose of operating costs incurred by the provider in
 25 21 the provision of business development services to emerging
 25 22 and early=stage innovation companies in Iowa.  The division
 25 23 further requires that such financial assistance shall not be
 25 24 distributed to owners or investors of the company to which the
 25 25 business development services are being provided and shall not
 25 26 be provided to other persons assisting with the provision of
 25 27 the services.
 25 28    Under current law, an entrepreneurial assistance provider is
 25 29 required to accept client referrals from the EDA as a condition
 25 30 of receiving a grant.  The division provides that the EDA may
 25 31 make client referrals to eligible providers.
 25 32    DIVISION IV ==== MISCELLANEOUS CHANGES.  Division IV makes
 25 33 several miscellaneous changes to other EDA programs.  The
 25 34 division amends the sales and use tax refund available under
 25 35 the workforce housing tax incentive program.  That refund
 26  1 is available for sales and use tax paid prior to project
 26  2 completion, which is currently defined to mean the first date
 26  3 upon which the average annualized production of finished
 26  4 product for the preceding 90=day period at the manufacturing
 26  5 facility operated by the eligible business is at least 50
 26  6 percent of the initial design capacity of the facility.  The
 26  7 division amends the definition of "project completion" to mean
 26  8 the date on which the EDA notifies the department of revenue
 26  9 that all applicable requirements of a workforce housing tax
 26 10 incentive program agreement are satisfied.  This provision
 26 11 takes effect upon enactment and applies retroactively to July
 26 12 1, 2014, for all workforce housing tax incentive agreements
 26 13 entered into on or after that date.
 26 14    The division allows the EDA to extend the project
 26 15 completion date for a project awarded tax incentives under the
 26 16 redevelopment tax credit program and the housing enterprise
 26 17 zone tax incentives program if the property that is the subject
 26 18 of the project suffered a catastrophic fire during the 2014
 26 19 calendar year.

 20 13 and filing as a partnership for federal tax purposes, estate,
 20 14 or trust electing to have the income taxed directly to the
 20 15 individual may be claimed by the individual based upon the pro
 20 16 rata share of the individual's earnings from that entity.
 20 17    The division provides that the program is subject to the
 20 18 EDA's maximum aggregate tax credit cap of $170 million per
 20 19 fiscal year in Code section 15.119, and not more than $15
 20 20 million per fiscal year may be issued by the EDA under the
 20 21 program.  In addition, the maximum amount of tax credit that
 20 22 may be issued to an eligible business in any one calendar year
 20 23 shall not exceed $1 million or $500,000, depending on whether
 20 24 the eligible business has been operating in Iowa at the time of
 20 25 application for five or fewer years, or more than five years,
 20 26 respectively.  An eligible business shall not receive more than
 20 27 five tax credits under the program.  The EDA is required to
 20 28 issue tax credits on a first=come, first=served basis until the
 20 29 maximum amount of $15 million per fiscal year is reached.  If
 20 30 the amount of tax credits exceeds this amount in a fiscal year,
 20 31 the EDA is required to establish a wait list and give priority
 20 32 in subsequent years to the eligible businesses on the wait
 20 33 list.
 20 34    The division provides for the confidentiality of certain
 20 35 information under the program.  The identity of a tax credit
 21  1 recipient and the amount of the tax credit shall be considered
 21  2 public information under Code chapter 22 (examination of public
 21  3 records), but any other information or record in the possession
 21  4 of the EDA with respect to the program shall be presumed by
 21  5 the EDA to be a trade secret protected under Code chapter 550
 21  6 or common law and shall be kept confidential by the EDA unless
 21  7 otherwise ordered by a court.
 21  8    The division takes effect upon enactment and applies to
 21  9 renewable chemicals produced in Iowa from biomass feedstock on
 21 10 or after that date.  The division applies retroactively to tax
 21 11 years beginning on or after January 1, 2015.
 21 12    DIVISION II ==== ANGEL INVESTOR TAX CREDITS.   Division II
 21 13 makes several changes to the tax credit for investments in
 21 14 qualifying businesses and community=based seed capital funds,
 21 15 often referred to as the angel investor tax credits.  The
 21 16 division amends the purpose of the tax credit in Code section
 21 17 15E.41.  The division excludes investments in community=based
 21 18 seed capital funds from qualifying for the tax credit and
 21 19 makes several conforming amendments to remove references to
 21 20 community=based seed capital funds from the Code.
 21 21    The division modifies the amount and dollar limitation of
 21 22 the tax credit for a taxpayer.  The tax credit is increased
 21 23 from 20 percent to 25 percent of a taxpayer's equity investment
 21 24 in a qualifying business.  Under current law, a taxpayer cannot
 21 25 claim more than $50,000 of tax credit per investment in a
 21 26 qualifying business, and for each tax year a taxpayer and the
 21 27 taxpayer's affiliates cannot claim tax credits for more than
 21 28 five investments in five different qualifying businesses.  The
 21 29 division amends this dollar limitation to prohibit a natural
 21 30 person and the person's spouse, child, or sibling from claiming
 21 31 a combined amount of more than $100,000 in tax credits per tax
 21 32 year.
 21 33    The division also provides that no more than $500,000 in tax
 21 34 credits may be issued per tax year for equity investments in
 21 35 any one qualifying business.
 22  1 The division modifies the procedures for claiming the tax
 22  2 credit.  Under current law, the tax credit is not refundable
 22  3 but available for carryforward for up to five tax years.  The
 22  4 division makes the tax credit refundable for an investment
 22  5 made by a natural person, and for any other person reduces the
 22  6 carryforward period to three years.
 22  7    The division strikes a provision permitting the EDA
 22  8 to cooperate with small business development centers to
 22  9 disseminate information regarding the credits and to develop
 22 10 standard application forms, and requiring the EDA to distribute
 22 11 copies of the application forms to all community=based seed
 22 12 capital funds and potential individual investors.
 22 13    The division modifies the eligibility requirements for
 22 14 qualifying businesses.  The division strikes the requirement
 22 15 that a business have an owner that meets at least one of
 22 16 four qualifications relating to business education or
 22 17 business experience.  The division requires that a business
 22 18 be participating in an entrepreneurial assistance program,
 22 19 as defined in the division, but allows the EDA to waive this
 22 20 requirement if the business establishes that its owners,
 22 21 directors, officers, and employees have an appropriate level
 22 22 of experience such that an entrepreneurial assistance program
 22 23 would not materially change the prospects of the business.
 22 24 The EDA is allowed to consult with outside service providers
 22 25 in considering such a waiver.  The division increases from $5
 22 26 million to $10 million the maximum amount of net worth that
 22 27 a business may have to be considered a qualifying business.
 22 28 The division increases from $250,000 to $500,000 the amount of
 22 29 financing that a business must have in order to be considered a
 22 30 qualifying business, removes "near equity" from the types of
 22 31 financing that will be considered in that calculation, requires
 22 32 that the financing be secured at the time of application for
 22 33 the tax credits, and requires that the business have at least
 22 34 two investors at the time of application for the tax credits.
 22 35 These modified eligibility requirements apply to businesses
 23  1 that submit an application to the EDA to be registered as a
 23  2 qualifying business on or after the effective date of this
 23  3 division of the bill, and businesses that submitted such an
 23  4 application to the EDA before the effective date of this
 23  5 division of the bill shall be governed by current law.
 23  6    The division provides for the confidentiality of certain
 23  7 information with regard to the tax credit.  The identity of
 23  8 a qualifying business, the identity of an investor and the
 23  9 qualifying business in which the investor made an equity
 23 10 investment, and the total number and amount of tax credits
 23 11 issued shall be considered public information under Code
 23 12 chapter 22 (examination of public records), but any other
 23 13 information or record in the possession of the EDA with respect
 23 14 to the program shall be presumed by the EDA to be a trade secret
 23 15 protected under Code chapter 550 or common law and shall be
 23 16 kept confidential by the EDA unless otherwise ordered by a
 23 17 court.
 23 18    The division takes effect upon enactment and applies to
 23 19 equity investments in a qualifying business made on or after
 23 20 that date.  Equity investments in a qualifying business or
 23 21 community=based seed capital fund made prior to the effective
 23 22 date of the division shall be governed by current law.
 23 23    DIVISION III ==== ENTREPRENEUR INVESTMENT AWARDS PROGRAM.
 23 24  Division III amends the entrepreneur investment awards program
 23 25 administered by the EDA.  The division strikes provisions that
 23 26 prohibited the EDA from making awards under the program since
 23 27 July 1, 2014, and that required the EDA by December 31, 2014,
 23 28 to conduct a comprehensive review of the program and submit

 23 32 to provide financial assistance to eligible entrepreneurial
 23 33 assistance providers (provider) that provide technical and
 23 34 financial assistance to entrepreneurs and start=up companies
 23 35 seeking to create, locate, or expand a business in Iowa.

 24 16 business development services to emerging and early=stage
 24 17 innovation companies to assist in the creation, location,

 24 21 location of the provider or the company and may be provided in
 24 22 consideration of equity participation in the company, a fee for

 24 24    Under current law, the EDA board could approve, deny, or

 25  9 assistance program cannot exceed the lesser of 25 percent of
 25 10 the funds expended by the program during the previous fiscal
 25 11 year, 100 percent of the funds raised from certain persons
 25 12 by the program during the previous fiscal year, or $200,000.
 25 13 The division provides that the amount of financial assistance
 25 14 awarded to any one provider shall not exceed $200,000.
 25 15    The division modifies the permitted use of funds received
 25 16 under the program.  Under current law, grants are only
 25 17 permitted to be used for the purpose of operating costs
 25 18 incurred by the program.  The division specifies that financial

 20 24 the eligible business has been operating in Iowa at the time of
 20 25 application for five or fewer years, or more than five years,
 20 26 respectively.  An eligible business shall not receive more than
 20 27 five tax credits under the program.  The EDA is required to
 20 28 issue tax credits on a first=come, first=served basis until the
 20 29 maximum amount of $15 million per fiscal year is reached.  If
 20 30 the amount of tax credits exceeds this amount in a fiscal year,
 20 31 the EDA is required to establish a wait list and give priority
 20 32 in subsequent years to the eligible businesses on the wait
 20 33 list.
 20 34    The division provides for the confidentiality of certain
 20 35 information under the program.  The identity of a tax credit
 21  1 recipient and the amount of the tax credit shall be considered
 21  2 public information under Code chapter 22 (examination of public
 21  3 records), but any other information or record in the possession
 21  4 of the EDA with respect to the program shall be presumed by
 21  5 the EDA to be a trade secret protected under Code chapter 550
 21  6 or common law and shall be kept confidential by the EDA unless
 21  7 otherwise ordered by a court.
 21  8    The division takes effect upon enactment and applies to
 21  9 renewable chemicals produced in Iowa from biomass feedstock on
 21 10 or after that date.  The division applies retroactively to tax
 21 11 years beginning on or after January 1, 2015.
 21 12    DIVISION II ==== ANGEL INVESTOR TAX CREDITS.   Division II
 21 13 makes several changes to the tax credit for investments in
 21 14 qualifying businesses and community=based seed capital funds,
 21 15 often referred to as the angel investor tax credits.  The
 21 16 division amends the purpose of the tax credit in Code section
 21 17 15E.41.  The division excludes investments in community=based
 21 18 seed capital funds from qualifying for the tax credit and
 21 19 makes several conforming amendments to remove references to
 21 20 community=based seed capital funds from the Code.
 21 21    The division modifies the amount and dollar limitation of
 21 22 the tax credit for a taxpayer.  The tax credit is increased
 21 23 from 20 percent to 25 percent of a taxpayer's equity investment
 21 24 in a qualifying business.  Under current law, a taxpayer cannot
 21 25 claim more than $50,000 of tax credit per investment in a
 21 26 qualifying business, and for each tax year a taxpayer and the
 21 27 taxpayer's affiliates cannot claim tax credits for more than
 21 28 five investments in five different qualifying businesses.  The
 21 29 division amends this dollar limitation to prohibit a natural
 21 30 person and the person's spouse, child, or sibling from claiming
 21 31 a combined amount of more than $100,000 in tax credits per tax
 21 32 year.
 21 33    The division also provides that no more than $500,000 in tax
 21 34 credits may be issued per tax year for equity investments in
 21 35 any one qualifying business.
 22  1 The division modifies the procedures for claiming the tax
 22  2 credit.  Under current law, the tax credit is not refundable
 22  3 but available for carryforward for up to five tax years.  The
 22  4 division makes the tax credit refundable for an investment
 22  5 made by a natural person, and for any other person reduces the
 22  6 carryforward period to three years.
 22  7    The division strikes a provision permitting the EDA
 22  8 to cooperate with small business development centers to
 22  9 disseminate information regarding the credits and to develop
 22 10 standard application forms, and requiring the EDA to distribute
 22 11 copies of the application forms to all community=based seed
 22 12 capital funds and potential individual investors.
 22 13    The division modifies the eligibility requirements for
 22 14 qualifying businesses.  The division strikes the requirement
 22 15 that a business have an owner that meets at least one of
 22 16 four qualifications relating to business education or
 22 17 business experience.  The division requires that a business
 22 18 be participating in an entrepreneurial assistance program,
 22 19 as defined in the division, but allows the EDA to waive this
 22 20 requirement if the business establishes that its owners,
 22 21 directors, officers, and employees have an appropriate level
 22 22 of experience such that an entrepreneurial assistance program
 22 23 would not materially change the prospects of the business.
 22 24 The EDA is allowed to consult with outside service providers
 22 25 in considering such a waiver.  The division increases from $5
 22 26 million to $10 million the maximum amount of net worth that
 22 27 a business may have to be considered a qualifying business.
 22 28 The division increases from $250,000 to $500,000 the amount of
 22 29 financing that a business must have in order to be considered a
 22 30 qualifying business, removes "near equity" from the types of
 22 31 financing that will be considered in that calculation, requires
 22 32 that the financing be secured at the time of application for
 22 33 the tax credits, and requires that the business have at least
 22 34 two investors at the time of application for the tax credits.
 22 35 These modified eligibility requirements apply to businesses
 23  1 that submit an application to the EDA to be registered as a
 23  2 qualifying business on or after the effective date of this
 23  3 division of the bill, and businesses that submitted such an
 23  4 application to the EDA before the effective date of this
 23  5 division of the bill shall be governed by current law.
 23  6    The division provides for the confidentiality of certain
 23  7 information with regard to the tax credit.  The identity of
 23  8 a qualifying business, the identity of an investor and the
 23  9 qualifying business in which the investor made an equity
 23 10 investment, and the total number and amount of tax credits
 23 11 issued shall be considered public information under Code
 23 12 chapter 22 (examination of public records), but any other
 23 13 information or record in the possession of the EDA with respect
 23 14 to the program shall be presumed by the EDA to be a trade secret
 23 15 protected under Code chapter 550 or common law and shall be
 23 16 kept confidential by the EDA unless otherwise ordered by a
 23 17 court.
 23 18    The division takes effect upon enactment and applies to
 23 19 equity investments in a qualifying business made on or after
 23 20 that date.  Equity investments in a qualifying business or
 23 21 community=based seed capital fund made prior to the effective
 23 22 date of the division shall be governed by current law.
 23 23    DIVISION III ==== ENTREPRENEUR INVESTMENT AWARDS PROGRAM.
 23 24  Division III amends the entrepreneur investment awards program
 23 25 administered by the EDA.  The division strikes provisions that
 23 26 prohibited the EDA from making awards under the program since
 23 27 July 1, 2014, and that required the EDA by December 31, 2014,
 23 28 to conduct a comprehensive review of the program and submit
 23 29 a report with specified information to the governor and the
 23 30 general assembly.
 23 31    The division modifies the purpose of the program to be
 23 32 to provide financial assistance to eligible entrepreneurial
 23 33 assistance providers (provider) that provide technical and
 23 34 financial assistance to entrepreneurs and start=up companies
 23 35 seeking to create, locate, or expand a business in Iowa.
 24  1 "Financial assistance" is defined in the division.
 24  2    The division changes the requirements for receiving an
 24  3 award.  To be eligible to receive an award under current
 24  4 law, an entrepreneurial assistance program must have been
 24  5 an Iowa=based business, expended at least $500,000 during
 24  6 the previous fiscal year to provide technical and financial
 24  7 assistance services that meet the broad=based needs of
 24  8 entrepreneurs seeking to create, locate, or expand a business
 24  9 in Iowa that intends to derive more than 10 percent of its
 24 10 gross sales from markets outside Iowa; and must have engaged
 24 11 and communicated with certain other programs, funding sources,
 24 12 and entities for its entrepreneur clients.  The division
 24 13 amends the eligibility for receiving financial assistance to
 24 14 require that a provider have its principal place of operations
 24 15 in Iowa and that the provider offer a comprehensive set of
 24 16 business development services to emerging and early=stage
 24 17 innovation companies to assist in the creation, location,
 24 18 growth, and long=term success of the company in Iowa.
 24 19 "Business development services" is defined in the division.
 24 20 Business development services may be performed at the physical
 24 21 location of the provider or the company and may be provided in
 24 22 consideration of equity participation in the company, a fee for
 24 23 services, or a membership agreement with the company.
 24 24    Under current law, the EDA board could approve, deny, or
 24 25 defer each application for a grant, and was required to award
 24 26 grants on a first=come, first=served basis.  The division
 24 27 specifies that the EDA board has the discretion to approve,
 24 28 deny, or defer each application for financial assistance and
 24 29 that the amount of financial assistance awarded to a provider
 24 30 is within the discretion of the EDA.  The division requires
 24 31 the EDA to award financial assistance on a competitive basis
 24 32 and allows the EDA to develop scoring criteria and establish
 24 33 minimum requirements for the receipt of a financial assistance
 24 34 award.
 24 35    In addition to the four factors relating to the provider's
 25  1 professional staff that the EDA may consider under current
 25  2 law in deciding whether to award financial assistance, the
 25  3 division provides that the EDA may also consider the service
 25  4 model and likelihood of success of the provider, the provider's
 25  5 similarity to other successful providers in the country, and
 25  6 the provider's financial need.
 25  7    The division modifies the maximum award amount for a
 25  8 recipient.  Under current law, a grant to an entrepreneur
 25  9 assistance program cannot exceed the lesser of 25 percent of
 25 10 the funds expended by the program during the previous fiscal
 25 11 year, 100 percent of the funds raised from certain persons
 25 12 by the program during the previous fiscal year, or $200,000.
 25 13 The division provides that the amount of financial assistance
 25 14 awarded to any one provider shall not exceed $200,000.
 25 15    The division modifies the permitted use of funds received
 25 16 under the program.  Under current law, grants are only
 25 17 permitted to be used for the purpose of operating costs
 25 18 incurred by the program.  The division specifies that financial
 25 19 assistance awarded to a provider shall only be used for
 25 20 the purpose of operating costs incurred by the provider in
 25 21 the provision of business development services to emerging
 25 22 and early=stage innovation companies in Iowa.  The division
 25 23 further requires that such financial assistance shall not be
 25 24 distributed to owners or investors of the company to which the
 25 25 business development services are being provided and shall not
 25 26 be provided to other persons assisting with the provision of
 25 27 the services.
 25 28    Under current law, an entrepreneurial assistance provider is
 25 29 required to accept client referrals from the EDA as a condition
 25 30 of receiving a grant.  The division provides that the EDA may
 25 31 make client referrals to eligible providers.
 25 32    DIVISION IV ==== MISCELLANEOUS CHANGES.  Division IV makes
 25 33 several miscellaneous changes to other EDA programs.  The
 25 34 division amends the sales and use tax refund available under
 25 35 the workforce housing tax incentive program.  That refund
 26  1 is available for sales and use tax paid prior to project
 26  2 completion, which is currently defined to mean the first date
 26  3 upon which the average annualized production of finished
 26  4 product for the preceding 90=day period at the manufacturing
 26  5 facility operated by the eligible business is at least 50
 26  6 percent of the initial design capacity of the facility.  The
 26  7 division amends the definition of "project completion" to mean
 26  8 the date on which the EDA notifies the department of revenue
 26  9 that all applicable requirements of a workforce housing tax
 26 10 incentive program agreement are satisfied.  This provision
 26 11 takes effect upon enactment and applies retroactively to July
 26 12 1, 2014, for all workforce housing tax incentive agreements
 26 13 entered into on or after that date.
 26 14    The division allows the EDA to extend the project
 26 15 completion date for a project awarded tax incentives under the
 26 16 redevelopment tax credit program and the housing enterprise
 26 17 zone tax incentives program if the property that is the subject
 26 18 of the project suffered a catastrophic fire during the 2014
 26 19 calendar year.

       mm/sc
 20 15 individual may be claimed by the individual based upon the pro
 20 16 rata share of the individual's earnings from that entity.
 20 17    The division provides that the program is subject to the
 20 18 EDA's maximum aggregate tax credit cap of $170 million per
 20 19 fiscal year in Code section 15.119, and not more than $15
 20 20 million per fiscal year may be issued by the EDA under the
 20 21 program.  In addition, the maximum amount of tax credit that
 20 22 may be issued to an eligible business in any one calendar year
 20 23 shall not exceed $1 million or $500,000, depending on whether
 20 24 the eligible business has been operating in Iowa at the time of
 20 25 application for five or fewer years, or more than five years,
 20 26 respectively.  An eligible business shall not receive more than
 20 27 five tax credits under the program.  The EDA is required to
 20 28 issue tax credits on a first=come, first=served basis until the
 20 29 maximum amount of $15 million per fiscal year is reached.  If
 20 30 the amount of tax credits exceeds this amount in a fiscal year,
 20 31 the EDA is required to establish a wait list and give priority
 20 32 in subsequent years to the eligible businesses on the wait
 20 33 list.
 20 34    The division provides for the confidentiality of certain
 20 35 information under the program.  The identity of a tax credit
 21  1 recipient and the amount of the tax credit shall be considered
 21  2 public information under Code chapter 22 (examination of public
 21  3 records), but any other information or record in the possession
 21  4 of the EDA with respect to the program shall be presumed by
 21  5 the EDA to be a trade secret protected under Code chapter 550
 21  6 or common law and shall be kept confidential by the EDA unless
 21  7 otherwise ordered by a court.
 21  8    The division takes effect upon enactment and applies to
 21  9 renewable chemicals produced in Iowa from biomass feedstock on
 21 10 or after that date.  The division applies retroactively to tax
 21 11 years beginning on or after January 1, 2015.
 21 12    DIVISION II ==== ANGEL INVESTOR TAX CREDITS.   Division II
 21 13 makes several changes to the tax credit for investments in
 21 14 qualifying businesses and community=based seed capital funds,
 21 15 often referred to as the angel investor tax credits.  The
 21 16 division amends the purpose of the tax credit in Code section
 21 17 15E.41.  The division excludes investments in community=based
 21 18 seed capital funds from qualifying for the tax credit and
 21 19 makes several conforming amendments to remove references to
 21 20 community=based seed capital funds from the Code.
 21 21    The division modifies the amount and dollar limitation of
 21 22 the tax credit for a taxpayer.  The tax credit is increased
 21 23 from 20 percent to 25 percent of a taxpayer's equity investment
 21 24 in a qualifying business.  Under current law, a taxpayer cannot
 21 25 claim more than $50,000 of tax credit per investment in a
 21 26 qualifying business, and for each tax year a taxpayer and the
 21 27 taxpayer's affiliates cannot claim tax credits for more than
 21 28 five investments in five different qualifying businesses.  The
 21 29 division amends this dollar limitation to prohibit a natural
 21 30 person and the person's spouse, child, or sibling from claiming
 21 31 a combined amount of more than $100,000 in tax credits per tax
 21 32 year.
 21 33    The division also provides that no more than $500,000 in tax
 21 34 credits may be issued per tax year for equity investments in
 21 35 any one qualifying business.
 22  1 The division modifies the procedures for claiming the tax
 22  2 credit.  Under current law, the tax credit is not refundable
 22  3 but available for carryforward for up to five tax years.  The
 22  4 division makes the tax credit refundable for an investment
 22  5 made by a natural person, and for any other person reduces the
 22  6 carryforward period to three years.
 22  7    The division strikes a provision permitting the EDA
 22  8 to cooperate with small business development centers to
 22  9 disseminate information regarding the credits and to develop
 22 10 standard application forms, and requiring the EDA to distribute
 22 11 copies of the application forms to all community=based seed
 22 12 capital funds and potential individual investors.
 22 13    The division modifies the eligibility requirements for
 22 14 qualifying businesses.  The division strikes the requirement
 22 15 that a business have an owner that meets at least one of
 22 16 four qualifications relating to business education or
 22 17 business experience.  The division requires that a business
 22 18 be participating in an entrepreneurial assistance program,
 22 19 as defined in the division, but allows the EDA to waive this
 22 20 requirement if the business establishes that its owners,
 22 21 directors, officers, and employees have an appropriate level
 22 22 of experience such that an entrepreneurial assistance program
 22 23 would not materially change the prospects of the business.
 22 24 The EDA is allowed to consult with outside service providers
 22 25 in considering such a waiver.  The division increases from $5
 22 26 million to $10 million the maximum amount of net worth that
 22 27 a business may have to be considered a qualifying business.
 22 28 The division increases from $250,000 to $500,000 the amount of
 22 29 financing that a business must have in order to be considered a
 22 30 qualifying business, removes "near equity" from the types of
 22 31 financing that will be considered in that calculation, requires
 22 32 that the financing be secured at the time of application for
 22 33 the tax credits, and requires that the business have at least
 22 34 two investors at the time of application for the tax credits.
 22 35 These modified eligibility requirements apply to businesses
 23  1 that submit an application to the EDA to be registered as a
 23  2 qualifying business on or after the effective date of this
 23  3 division of the bill, and businesses that submitted such an
 23  4 application to the EDA before the effective date of this
 23  5 division of the bill shall be governed by current law.
 23  6    The division provides for the confidentiality of certain
 23  7 information with regard to the tax credit.  The identity of
 23  8 a qualifying business, the identity of an investor and the
 23  9 qualifying business in which the investor made an equity
 23 10 investment, and the total number and amount of tax credits
 23 11 issued shall be considered public information under Code
 23 12 chapter 22 (examination of public records), but any other
 23 13 information or record in the possession of the EDA with respect
 23 14 to the program shall be presumed by the EDA to be a trade secret
 23 15 protected under Code chapter 550 or common law and shall be
 23 16 kept confidential by the EDA unless otherwise ordered by a
 23 17 court.
 23 18    The division takes effect upon enactment and applies to
 23 19 equity investments in a qualifying business made on or after
 23 20 that date.  Equity investments in a qualifying business or
 23 21 community=based seed capital fund made prior to the effective
 23 22 date of the division shall be governed by current law.
 23 23    DIVISION III ==== ENTREPRENEUR INVESTMENT AWARDS PROGRAM.
 23 24  Division III amends the entrepreneur investment awards program
 23 25 administered by the EDA.  The division strikes provisions that
 23 26 prohibited the EDA from making awards under the program since
 23 27 July 1, 2014, and that required the EDA by December 31, 2014,
 23 28 to conduct a comprehensive review of the program and submit
 23 29 a report with specified information to the governor and the
 23 30 general assembly.
 23 31    The division modifies the purpose of the program to be
 23 32 to provide financial assistance to eligible entrepreneurial
 23 33 assistance providers (provider) that provide technical and
 23 34 financial assistance to entrepreneurs and start=up companies
 23 35 seeking to create, locate, or expand a business in Iowa.
 24  1 "Financial assistance" is defined in the division.
 24  2    The division changes the requirements for receiving an
 24  3 award.  To be eligible to receive an award under current
 24  4 law, an entrepreneurial assistance program must have been
 24  5 an Iowa=based business, expended at least $500,000 during
 24  6 the previous fiscal year to provide technical and financial
 24  7 assistance services that meet the broad=based needs of
 24  8 entrepreneurs seeking to create, locate, or expand a business
 24  9 in Iowa that intends to derive more than 10 percent of its
 24 10 gross sales from markets outside Iowa; and must have engaged
 24 11 and communicated with certain other programs, funding sources,
 24 12 and entities for its entrepreneur clients.  The division
 24 13 amends the eligibility for receiving financial assistance to
 24 14 require that a provider have its principal place of operations
 24 15 in Iowa and that the provider offer a comprehensive set of
 24 16 business development services to emerging and early=stage
 24 17 innovation companies to assist in the creation, location,
 24 18 growth, and long=term success of the company in Iowa.
 24 19 "Business development services" is defined in the division.
 24 20 Business development services may be performed at the physical
 24 21 location of the provider or the company and may be provided in
 24 22 consideration of equity participation in the company, a fee for
 24 23 services, or a membership agreement with the company.
 24 24    Under current law, the EDA board could approve, deny, or
 24 25 defer each application for a grant, and was required to award
 24 26 grants on a first=come, first=served basis.  The division
 24 27 specifies that the EDA board has the discretion to approve,
 24 28 deny, or defer each application for financial assistance and
 24 29 that the amount of financial assistance awarded to a provider
 24 30 is within the discretion of the EDA.  The division requires
 24 31 the EDA to award financial assistance on a competitive basis
 24 32 and allows the EDA to develop scoring criteria and establish
 24 33 minimum requirements for the receipt of a financial assistance
 24 34 award.
 24 35    In addition to the four factors relating to the provider's
 25  1 professional staff that the EDA may consider under current
 25  2 law in deciding whether to award financial assistance, the
 25  3 division provides that the EDA may also consider the service
 25  4 model and likelihood of success of the provider, the provider's
 25  5 similarity to other successful providers in the country, and
 25  6 the provider's financial need.
 25  7    The division modifies the maximum award amount for a
 25  8 recipient.  Under current law, a grant to an entrepreneur
 25  9 assistance program cannot exceed the lesser of 25 percent of
 25 10 the funds expended by the program during the previous fiscal
 25 11 year, 100 percent of the funds raised from certain persons
 25 12 by the program during the previous fiscal year, or $200,000.
 25 13 The division provides that the amount of financial assistance
 25 14 awarded to any one provider shall not exceed $200,000.
 25 15    The division modifies the permitted use of funds received
 25 16 under the program.  Under current law, grants are only
 25 17 permitted to be used for the purpose of operating costs
 25 18 incurred by the program.  The division specifies that financial
 25 19 assistance awarded to a provider shall only be used for
 25 20 the purpose of operating costs incurred by the provider in
 25 21 the provision of business development services to emerging
 25 22 and early=stage innovation companies in Iowa.  The division
 25 23 further requires that such financial assistance shall not be
 25 24 distributed to owners or investors of the company to which the
 25 25 business development services are being provided and shall not
 25 26 be provided to other persons assisting with the provision of
 25 27 the services.
 25 28    Under current law, an entrepreneurial assistance provider is
 25 29 required to accept client referrals from the EDA as a condition
 25 30 of receiving a grant.  The division provides that the EDA may
 25 31 make client referrals to eligible providers.
 25 32    DIVISION IV ==== MISCELLANEOUS CHANGES.  Division IV makes
 25 33 several miscellaneous changes to other EDA programs.  The
 25 34 division amends the sales and use tax refund available under
 25 35 the workforce housing tax incentive program.  That refund
 26  1 is available for sales and use tax paid prior to project
 26  2 completion, which is currently defined to mean the first date
 26  3 upon which the average annualized production of finished
 26  4 product for the preceding 90=day period at the manufacturing
 26  5 facility operated by the eligible business is at least 50
 26  6 percent of the initial design capacity of the facility.  The
 26  7 division amends the definition of "project completion" to mean
 26  8 the date on which the EDA notifies the department of revenue
 26  9 that all applicable requirements of a workforce housing tax
 26 10 incentive program agreement are satisfied.  This provision
 26 11 takes effect upon enactment and applies retroactively to July
 26 12 1, 2014, for all workforce housing tax incentive agreements
 26 13 entered into on or after that date.
 26 14    The division allows the EDA to extend the project

 20 18 EDA's maximum aggregate tax credit cap of $170 million per
 20 19 fiscal year in Code section 15.119, and not more than $15
 20 20 million per fiscal year may be issued by the EDA under the
 20 21 program.  In addition, the maximum amount of tax credit that
 20 22 may be issued to an eligible business in any one calendar year
 20 23 shall not exceed $1 million or $500,000, depending on whether
 20 24 the eligible business has been operating in Iowa at the time of
 20 25 application for five or fewer years, or more than five years,
 20 26 respectively.  An eligible business shall not receive more than
 20 27 five tax credits under the program.  The EDA is required to
 20 28 issue tax credits on a first=come, first=served basis until the
 20 29 maximum amount of $15 million per fiscal year is reached.  If
 20 30 the amount of tax credits exceeds this amount in a fiscal year,
 20 31 the EDA is required to establish a wait list and give priority
 20 32 in subsequent years to the eligible businesses on the wait
 20 33 list.
 20 34    The division provides for the confidentiality of certain
 20 35 information under the program.  The identity of a tax credit
 21  1 recipient and the amount of the tax credit shall be considered
 21  2 public information under Code chapter 22 (examination of public
 21  3 records), but any other information or record in the possession
 21  4 of the EDA with respect to the program shall be presumed by
 21  5 the EDA to be a trade secret protected under Code chapter 550
 21  6 or common law and shall be kept confidential by the EDA unless
 21  7 otherwise ordered by a court.
 21  8    The division takes effect upon enactment and applies to
 21  9 renewable chemicals produced in Iowa from biomass feedstock on
 21 10 or after that date.  The division applies retroactively to tax
 21 11 years beginning on or after January 1, 2015.
 21 12    DIVISION II ==== ANGEL INVESTOR TAX CREDITS.   Division II
 21 13 makes several changes to the tax credit for investments in
 21 14 qualifying businesses and community=based seed capital funds,
 21 15 often referred to as the angel investor tax credits.  The
 21 16 division amends the purpose of the tax credit in Code section
 21 17 15E.41.  The division excludes investments in community=based
 21 18 seed capital funds from qualifying for the tax credit and
 21 19 makes several conforming amendments to remove references to
 21 20 community=based seed capital funds from the Code.
 21 21    The division modifies the amount and dollar limitation of
 21 22 the tax credit for a taxpayer.  The tax credit is increased
 21 23 from 20 percent to 25 percent of a taxpayer's equity investment
 21 24 in a qualifying business.  Under current law, a taxpayer cannot
 21 25 claim more than $50,000 of tax credit per investment in a
 21 26 qualifying business, and for each tax year a taxpayer and the
 21 27 taxpayer's affiliates cannot claim tax credits for more than
 21 28 five investments in five different qualifying businesses.  The
 21 29 division amends this dollar limitation to prohibit a natural
 21 30 person and the person's spouse, child, or sibling from claiming
 21 31 a combined amount of more than $100,000 in tax credits per tax
 21 32 year.
 21 33    The division also provides that no more than $500,000 in tax
 21 34 credits may be issued per tax year for equity investments in
 21 35 any one qualifying business.
 22  1 The division modifies the procedures for claiming the tax
 22  2 credit.  Under current law, the tax credit is not refundable
 22  3 but available for carryforward for up to five tax years.  The
 22  4 division makes the tax credit refundable for an investment
 22  5 made by a natural person, and for any other person reduces the
 22  6 carryforward period to three years.
 22  7    The division strikes a provision permitting the EDA
 22  8 to cooperate with small business development centers to
 22  9 disseminate information regarding the credits and to develop
 22 10 standard application forms, and requiring the EDA to distribute
 22 11 copies of the application forms to all community=based seed
 22 12 capital funds and potential individual investors.
 22 13    The division modifies the eligibility requirements for
 22 14 qualifying businesses.  The division strikes the requirement
 22 15 that a business have an owner that meets at least one of
 22 16 four qualifications relating to business education or
 22 17 business experience.  The division requires that a business
 22 18 be participating in an entrepreneurial assistance program,
 22 19 as defined in the division, but allows the EDA to waive this
 22 20 requirement if the business establishes that its owners,
 22 21 directors, officers, and employees have an appropriate level
 22 22 of experience such that an entrepreneurial assistance program
 22 23 would not materially change the prospects of the business.
 22 24 The EDA is allowed to consult with outside service providers
 22 25 in considering such a waiver.  The division increases from $5
 22 26 million to $10 million the maximum amount of net worth that
 22 27 a business may have to be considered a qualifying business.
 22 28 The division increases from $250,000 to $500,000 the amount of
 22 29 financing that a business must have in order to be considered a
 22 30 qualifying business, removes "near equity" from the types of
 22 31 financing that will be considered in that calculation, requires
 22 32 that the financing be secured at the time of application for
 22 33 the tax credits, and requires that the business have at least
 22 34 two investors at the time of application for the tax credits.
 22 35 These modified eligibility requirements apply to businesses
 23  1 that submit an application to the EDA to be registered as a
 23  2 qualifying business on or after the effective date of this
 23  3 division of the bill, and businesses that submitted such an
 23  4 application to the EDA before the effective date of this
 23  5 division of the bill shall be governed by current law.
 23  6    The division provides for the confidentiality of certain
 23  7 information with regard to the tax credit.  The identity of
 23  8 a qualifying business, the identity of an investor and the
 23  9 qualifying business in which the investor made an equity
 23 10 investment, and the total number and amount of tax credits
 23 11 issued shall be considered public information under Code
 23 12 chapter 22 (examination of public records), but any other
 23 13 information or record in the possession of the EDA with respect
 23 14 to the program shall be presumed by the EDA to be a trade secret
 23 15 protected under Code chapter 550 or common law and shall be
 23 16 kept confidential by the EDA unless otherwise ordered by a
 23 17 court.
 23 18    The division takes effect upon enactment and applies to
 23 19 equity investments in a qualifying business made on or after
 23 20 that date.  Equity investments in a qualifying business or
 23 21 community=based seed capital fund made prior to the effective
 23 22 date of the division shall be governed by current law.
 23 23    DIVISION III ==== ENTREPRENEUR INVESTMENT AWARDS PROGRAM.
 23 24  Division III amends the entrepreneur investment awards program
 23 25 administered by the EDA.  The division strikes provisions that
 23 26 prohibited the EDA from making awards under the program since
 23 27 July 1, 2014, and that required the EDA by December 31, 2014,
 23 28 to conduct a comprehensive review of the program and submit
 23 29 a report with specified information to the governor and the
 23 30 general assembly.
 23 31    The division modifies the purpose of the program to be
 23 32 to provide financial assistance to eligible entrepreneurial
 23 33 assistance providers (provider) that provide technical and
 23 34 financial assistance to entrepreneurs and start=up companies
 23 35 seeking to create, locate, or expand a business in Iowa.
 24  1 "Financial assistance" is defined in the division.
 24  2    The division changes the requirements for receiving an
 24  3 award.  To be eligible to receive an award under current
 24  4 law, an entrepreneurial assistance program must have been
 24  5 an Iowa=based business, expended at least $500,000 during
 24  6 the previous fiscal year to provide technical and financial
 24  7 assistance services that meet the broad=based needs of
 24  8 entrepreneurs seeking to create, locate, or expand a business
 24  9 in Iowa that intends to derive more than 10 percent of its
 24 10 gross sales from markets outside Iowa; and must have engaged
 24 11 and communicated with certain other programs, funding sources,
 24 12 and entities for its entrepreneur clients.  The division
 24 13 amends the eligibility for receiving financial assistance to
 24 14 require that a provider have its principal place of operations
 24 15 in Iowa and that the provider offer a comprehensive set of
 24 16 business development services to emerging and early=stage
 24 17 innovation companies to assist in the creation, location,
 24 18 growth, and long=term success of the company in Iowa.
 24 19 "Business development services" is defined in the division.
 24 20 Business development services may be performed at the physical
 24 21 location of the provider or the company and may be provided in
 24 22 consideration of equity participation in the company, a fee for
 24 23 services, or a membership agreement with the company.
 24 24    Under current law, the EDA board could approve, deny, or
 24 25 defer each application for a grant, and was required to award
 24 26 grants on a first=come, first=served basis.  The division
 24 27 specifies that the EDA board has the discretion to approve,
 24 28 deny, or defer each application for financial assistance and
 24 29 that the amount of financial assistance awarded to a provider
 24 30 is within the discretion of the EDA.  The division requires
 24 31 the EDA to award financial assistance on a competitive basis
 24 32 and allows the EDA to develop scoring criteria and establish
 24 33 minimum requirements for the receipt of a financial assistance
 24 34 award.
 24 35    In addition to the four factors relating to the provider's
 25  1 professional staff that the EDA may consider under current
 25  2 law in deciding whether to award financial assistance, the
 25  3 division provides that the EDA may also consider the service
 25  4 model and likelihood of success of the provider, the provider's
 25  5 similarity to other successful providers in the country, and
 25  6 the provider's financial need.
 25  7    The division modifies the maximum award amount for a
 25  8 recipient.  Under current law, a grant to an entrepreneur
 25  9 assistance program cannot exceed the lesser of 25 percent of
 25 10 the funds expended by the program during the previous fiscal
 25 11 year, 100 percent of the funds raised from certain persons
 25 12 by the program during the previous fiscal year, or $200,000.
 25 13 The division provides that the amount of financial assistance
 25 14 awarded to any one provider shall not exceed $200,000.
 25 15    The division modifies the permitted use of funds received
 25 16 under the program.  Under current law, grants are only
 25 17 permitted to be used for the purpose of operating costs
 25 18 incurred by the program.  The division specifies that financial
 25 19 assistance awarded to a provider shall only be used for
 25 20 the purpose of operating costs incurred by the provider in
 25 21 the provision of business development services to emerging
 25 22 and early=stage innovation companies in Iowa.  The division
 25 23 further requires that such financial assistance shall not be
 25 24 distributed to owners or investors of the company to which the
 25 25 business development services are being provided and shall not
 25 26 be provided to other persons assisting with the provision of
 25 27 the services.
 25 28    Under current law, an entrepreneurial assistance provider is
 25 29 required to accept client referrals from the EDA as a condition
 25 30 of receiving a grant.  The division provides that the EDA may
 25 31 make client referrals to eligible providers.
 25 32    DIVISION IV ==== MISCELLANEOUS CHANGES.  Division IV makes
 25 33 several miscellaneous changes to other EDA programs.  The
 25 34 division amends the sales and use tax refund available under
 25 35 the workforce housing tax incentive program.  That refund
 26  1 is available for sales and use tax paid prior to project
 26  2 completion, which is currently defined to mean the first date
 26  3 upon which the average annualized production of finished
 26  4 product for the preceding 90=day period at the manufacturing
 26  5 facility operated by the eligible business is at least 50
 26  6 percent of the initial design capacity of the facility.  The
 26  7 division amends the definition of "project completion" to mean
 26  8 the date on which the EDA notifies the department of revenue
 26  9 that all applicable requirements of a workforce housing tax
 26 10 incentive program agreement are satisfied.  This provision
 26 11 takes effect upon enactment and applies retroactively to July
 26 12 1, 2014, for all workforce housing tax incentive agreements
 26 13 entered into on or after that date.
 26 14    The division allows the EDA to extend the project
 26 15 completion date for a project awarded tax incentives under the
 26 16 redevelopment tax credit program and the housing enterprise
 26 17 zone tax incentives program if the property that is the subject
 26 18 of the project suffered a catastrophic fire during the 2014
 26 19 calendar year.
       LSB 1212HV (3) 86
       mm/sc
 20 17    The division provides that the program is subject to the
 20 18 EDA's maximum aggregate tax credit cap of $170 million per
 20 19 fiscal year in Code section 15.119, and not more than $15
 20 20 million per fiscal year may be issued by the EDA under the
 20 21 program.  In addition, the maximum amount of tax credit that
 20 22 may be issued to an eligible business in any one calendar year
 20 23 shall not exceed $1 million or $500,000, depending on whether
 20 24 the eligible business has been operating in Iowa at the time of
 20 25 application for five or fewer years, or more than five years,
 20 26 respectively.  An eligible business shall not receive more than
 20 27 five tax credits under the program.  The EDA is required to
 20 28 issue tax credits on a first=come, first=served basis until the
 20 29 maximum amount of $15 million per fiscal year is reached.  If
 20 30 the amount of tax credits exceeds this amount in a fiscal year,
 20 31 the EDA is required to establish a wait list and give priority
 20 32 in subsequent years to the eligible businesses on the wait
 20 33 list.
 20 34    The division provides for the confidentiality of certain
 20 35 information under the program.  The identity of a tax credit
 21  1 recipient and the amount of the tax credit shall be considered
 21  2 public information under Code chapter 22 (examination of public
 21  3 records), but any other information or record in the possession
 21  4 of the EDA with respect to the program shall be presumed by
 21  5 the EDA to be a trade secret protected under Code chapter 550
 21  6 or common law and shall be kept confidential by the EDA unless
 21  7 otherwise ordered by a court.
 21  8    The division takes effect upon enactment and applies to
 21  9 renewable chemicals produced in Iowa from biomass feedstock on
 21 10 or after that date.  The division applies retroactively to tax
 21 11 years beginning on or after January 1, 2015.

 21 17 15E.41.  The division excludes investments in community=based
 21 18 seed capital funds from qualifying for the tax credit and
 21 19 makes several conforming amendments to remove references to
 21 20 community=based seed capital funds from the Code.
 21 21    The division modifies the amount and dollar limitation of
 21 22 the tax credit for a taxpayer.  The tax credit is increased
 21 23 from 20 percent to 25 percent of a taxpayer's equity investment
 21 24 in a qualifying business.  Under current law, a taxpayer cannot
 21 25 claim more than $50,000 of tax credit per investment in a
 21 26 qualifying business, and for each tax year a taxpayer and the
 21 27 taxpayer's affiliates cannot claim tax credits for more than
 21 28 five investments in five different qualifying businesses.  The
 21 29 division amends this dollar limitation to prohibit a natural
 21 30 person and the person's spouse, child, or sibling from claiming
 21 31 a combined amount of more than $100,000 in tax credits per tax
 21 32 year.
 21 33    The division also provides that no more than $500,000 in tax
 21 34 credits may be issued per tax year for equity investments in
 21 35 any one qualifying business.
 22  1 The division modifies the procedures for claiming the tax
 22  2 credit.  Under current law, the tax credit is not refundable
 22  3 but available for carryforward for up to five tax years.  The

 22  7    The division strikes a provision permitting the EDA
 22  8 to cooperate with small business development centers to
 22  9 disseminate information regarding the credits and to develop
 22 10 standard application forms, and requiring the EDA to distribute
 22 11 copies of the application forms to all community=based seed

 22 17 business experience.  The division requires that a business
 22 18 be participating in an entrepreneurial assistance program,

 22 21 directors, officers, and employees have an appropriate level
 22 22 of experience such that an entrepreneurial assistance program
 22 23 would not materially change the prospects of the business.
 22 24 The EDA is allowed to consult with outside service providers
 22 25 in considering such a waiver.  The division increases from $5
 22 26 million to $10 million the maximum amount of net worth that
 22 27 a business may have to be considered a qualifying business.
 22 28 The division increases from $250,000 to $500,000 the amount of
 22 29 financing that a business must have in order to be considered a
 22 30 qualifying business, removes "near equity" from the types of
 22 31 financing that will be considered in that calculation, requires

 23  5 division of the bill shall be governed by current law.
 23  6    The division provides for the confidentiality of certain
 23  7 information with regard to the tax credit.  The identity of
 23  8 a qualifying business, the identity of an investor and the
 23  9 qualifying business in which the investor made an equity
 23 10 investment, and the total number and amount of tax credits
 23 11 issued shall be considered public information under Code
 23 12 chapter 22 (examination of public records), but any other
 23 13 information or record in the possession of the EDA with respect

 23 23    DIVISION III ==== ENTREPRENEUR INVESTMENT AWARDS PROGRAM.

 26 18 of the project suffered a catastrophic fire during the 2014
 26 19 calendar year.

 20 18 EDA's maximum aggregate tax credit cap of $170 million per
 20 19 fiscal year in Code section 15.119, and not more than $15
 20 20 million per fiscal year may be issued by the EDA under the
 20 21 program.  In addition, the maximum amount of tax credit that
 20 22 may be issued to an eligible business in any one calendar year
 20 23 shall not exceed $1 million or $500,000, depending on whether
 20 24 the eligible business has been operating in Iowa at the time of
 20 25 application for five or fewer years, or more than five years,
 20 26 respectively.  An eligible business shall not receive more than
 20 27 five tax credits under the program.  The EDA is required to
 20 28 issue tax credits on a first=come, first=served basis until the
 20 29 maximum amount of $15 million per fiscal year is reached.  If
 20 30 the amount of tax credits exceeds this amount in a fiscal year,
 20 31 the EDA is required to establish a wait list and give priority
 20 32 in subsequent years to the eligible businesses on the wait
 20 33 list.
 20 34    The division provides for the confidentiality of certain
 20 35 information under the program.  The identity of a tax credit
 21  1 recipient and the amount of the tax credit shall be considered
 21  2 public information under Code chapter 22 (examination of public
 21  3 records), but any other information or record in the possession
 21  4 of the EDA with respect to the program shall be presumed by
 21  5 the EDA to be a trade secret protected under Code chapter 550
 21  6 or common law and shall be kept confidential by the EDA unless
 21  7 otherwise ordered by a court.
 21  8    The division takes effect upon enactment and applies to
 21  9 renewable chemicals produced in Iowa from biomass feedstock on
 21 10 or after that date.  The division applies retroactively to tax
 21 11 years beginning on or after January 1, 2015.
 21 12    DIVISION II ==== ANGEL INVESTOR TAX CREDITS.   Division II
 21 13 makes several changes to the tax credit for investments in
 21 14 qualifying businesses and community=based seed capital funds,
 21 15 often referred to as the angel investor tax credits.  The
 21 16 division amends the purpose of the tax credit in Code section
 21 17 15E.41.  The division excludes investments in community=based
 21 18 seed capital funds from qualifying for the tax credit and
 21 19 makes several conforming amendments to remove references to
 21 20 community=based seed capital funds from the Code.
 21 21    The division modifies the amount and dollar limitation of
 21 22 the tax credit for a taxpayer.  The tax credit is increased
 21 23 from 20 percent to 25 percent of a taxpayer's equity investment
 21 24 in a qualifying business.  Under current law, a taxpayer cannot
 21 25 claim more than $50,000 of tax credit per investment in a
 21 26 qualifying business, and for each tax year a taxpayer and the
 21 27 taxpayer's affiliates cannot claim tax credits for more than
 21 28 five investments in five different qualifying businesses.  The
 21 29 division amends this dollar limitation to prohibit a natural
 21 30 person and the person's spouse, child, or sibling from claiming
 21 31 a combined amount of more than $100,000 in tax credits per tax
 21 32 year.
 21 33    The division also provides that no more than $500,000 in tax
 21 34 credits may be issued per tax year for equity investments in
 21 35 any one qualifying business.
 22  1 The division modifies the procedures for claiming the tax
 22  2 credit.  Under current law, the tax credit is not refundable
 22  3 but available for carryforward for up to five tax years.  The
 22  4 division makes the tax credit refundable for an investment
 22  5 made by a natural person, and for any other person reduces the
 22  6 carryforward period to three years.
 22  7    The division strikes a provision permitting the EDA
 22  8 to cooperate with small business development centers to
 22  9 disseminate information regarding the credits and to develop
 22 10 standard application forms, and requiring the EDA to distribute
 22 11 copies of the application forms to all community=based seed
 22 12 capital funds and potential individual investors.
 22 13    The division modifies the eligibility requirements for
 22 14 qualifying businesses.  The division strikes the requirement
 22 15 that a business have an owner that meets at least one of
 22 16 four qualifications relating to business education or
 22 17 business experience.  The division requires that a business
 22 18 be participating in an entrepreneurial assistance program,
 22 19 as defined in the division, but allows the EDA to waive this
 22 20 requirement if the business establishes that its owners,
 22 21 directors, officers, and employees have an appropriate level
 22 22 of experience such that an entrepreneurial assistance program
 22 23 would not materially change the prospects of the business.
 22 24 The EDA is allowed to consult with outside service providers
 22 25 in considering such a waiver.  The division increases from $5
 22 26 million to $10 million the maximum amount of net worth that
 22 27 a business may have to be considered a qualifying business.
 22 28 The division increases from $250,000 to $500,000 the amount of
 22 29 financing that a business must have in order to be considered a
 22 30 qualifying business, removes "near equity" from the types of
 22 31 financing that will be considered in that calculation, requires
 22 32 that the financing be secured at the time of application for
 22 33 the tax credits, and requires that the business have at least
 22 34 two investors at the time of application for the tax credits.
 22 35 These modified eligibility requirements apply to businesses
 23  1 that submit an application to the EDA to be registered as a
 23  2 qualifying business on or after the effective date of this
 23  3 division of the bill, and businesses that submitted such an
 23  4 application to the EDA before the effective date of this
 23  5 division of the bill shall be governed by current law.
 23  6    The division provides for the confidentiality of certain
 23  7 information with regard to the tax credit.  The identity of
 23  8 a qualifying business, the identity of an investor and the
 23  9 qualifying business in which the investor made an equity
 23 10 investment, and the total number and amount of tax credits
 23 11 issued shall be considered public information under Code
 23 12 chapter 22 (examination of public records), but any other
 23 13 information or record in the possession of the EDA with respect
 23 14 to the program shall be presumed by the EDA to be a trade secret
 23 15 protected under Code chapter 550 or common law and shall be
 23 16 kept confidential by the EDA unless otherwise ordered by a
 23 17 court.
 23 18    The division takes effect upon enactment and applies to
 23 19 equity investments in a qualifying business made on or after
 23 20 that date.  Equity investments in a qualifying business or
 23 21 community=based seed capital fund made prior to the effective
 23 22 date of the division shall be governed by current law.
 23 23    DIVISION III ==== ENTREPRENEUR INVESTMENT AWARDS PROGRAM.
 23 24  Division III amends the entrepreneur investment awards program
 23 25 administered by the EDA.  The division strikes provisions that
 23 26 prohibited the EDA from making awards under the program since
 23 27 July 1, 2014, and that required the EDA by December 31, 2014,
 23 28 to conduct a comprehensive review of the program and submit
 23 29 a report with specified information to the governor and the
 23 30 general assembly.
 23 31    The division modifies the purpose of the program to be
 23 32 to provide financial assistance to eligible entrepreneurial
 23 33 assistance providers (provider) that provide technical and
 23 34 financial assistance to entrepreneurs and start=up companies
 23 35 seeking to create, locate, or expand a business in Iowa.
 24  1 "Financial assistance" is defined in the division.
 24  2    The division changes the requirements for receiving an
 24  3 award.  To be eligible to receive an award under current
 24  4 law, an entrepreneurial assistance program must have been
 24  5 an Iowa=based business, expended at least $500,000 during
 24  6 the previous fiscal year to provide technical and financial
 24  7 assistance services that meet the broad=based needs of
 24  8 entrepreneurs seeking to create, locate, or expand a business
 24  9 in Iowa that intends to derive more than 10 percent of its
 24 10 gross sales from markets outside Iowa; and must have engaged
 24 11 and communicated with certain other programs, funding sources,
 24 12 and entities for its entrepreneur clients.  The division
 24 13 amends the eligibility for receiving financial assistance to
 24 14 require that a provider have its principal place of operations
 24 15 in Iowa and that the provider offer a comprehensive set of
 24 16 business development services to emerging and early=stage
 24 17 innovation companies to assist in the creation, location,
 24 18 growth, and long=term success of the company in Iowa.
 24 19 "Business development services" is defined in the division.
 24 20 Business development services may be performed at the physical
 24 21 location of the provider or the company and may be provided in
 24 22 consideration of equity participation in the company, a fee for
 24 23 services, or a membership agreement with the company.
 24 24    Under current law, the EDA board could approve, deny, or
 24 25 defer each application for a grant, and was required to award
 24 26 grants on a first=come, first=served basis.  The division
 24 27 specifies that the EDA board has the discretion to approve,
 24 28 deny, or defer each application for financial assistance and
 24 29 that the amount of financial assistance awarded to a provider
 24 30 is within the discretion of the EDA.  The division requires
 24 31 the EDA to award financial assistance on a competitive basis
 24 32 and allows the EDA to develop scoring criteria and establish
 24 33 minimum requirements for the receipt of a financial assistance
 24 34 award.
 24 35    In addition to the four factors relating to the provider's
 25  1 professional staff that the EDA may consider under current
 25  2 law in deciding whether to award financial assistance, the
 25  3 division provides that the EDA may also consider the service
 25  4 model and likelihood of success of the provider, the provider's
 25  5 similarity to other successful providers in the country, and
 25  6 the provider's financial need.
 25  7    The division modifies the maximum award amount for a
 25  8 recipient.  Under current law, a grant to an entrepreneur
 25  9 assistance program cannot exceed the lesser of 25 percent of
 25 10 the funds expended by the program during the previous fiscal
 25 11 year, 100 percent of the funds raised from certain persons
 25 12 by the program during the previous fiscal year, or $200,000.
 25 13 The division provides that the amount of financial assistance
 25 14 awarded to any one provider shall not exceed $200,000.
 25 15    The division modifies the permitted use of funds received
 25 16 under the program.  Under current law, grants are only
 25 17 permitted to be used for the purpose of operating costs
 25 18 incurred by the program.  The division specifies that financial
 25 19 assistance awarded to a provider shall only be used for
 25 20 the purpose of operating costs incurred by the provider in
 25 21 the provision of business development services to emerging
 25 22 and early=stage innovation companies in Iowa.  The division
 25 23 further requires that such financial assistance shall not be
 25 24 distributed to owners or investors of the company to which the
 25 25 business development services are being provided and shall not
 25 26 be provided to other persons assisting with the provision of
 25 27 the services.
 25 28    Under current law, an entrepreneurial assistance provider is
 25 29 required to accept client referrals from the EDA as a condition
 25 30 of receiving a grant.  The division provides that the EDA may
 25 31 make client referrals to eligible providers.
 25 32    DIVISION IV ==== MISCELLANEOUS CHANGES.  Division IV makes
 25 33 several miscellaneous changes to other EDA programs.  The
 25 34 division amends the sales and use tax refund available under
 25 35 the workforce housing tax incentive program.  That refund
 26  1 is available for sales and use tax paid prior to project
 26  2 completion, which is currently defined to mean the first date
 26  3 upon which the average annualized production of finished
 26  4 product for the preceding 90=day period at the manufacturing
 26  5 facility operated by the eligible business is at least 50
 26  6 percent of the initial design capacity of the facility.  The
 26  7 division amends the definition of "project completion" to mean
 26  8 the date on which the EDA notifies the department of revenue
 26  9 that all applicable requirements of a workforce housing tax
 26 10 incentive program agreement are satisfied.  This provision
 26 11 takes effect upon enactment and applies retroactively to July
 26 12 1, 2014, for all workforce housing tax incentive agreements
 26 13 entered into on or after that date.
 26 14    The division allows the EDA to extend the project
 26 15 completion date for a project awarded tax incentives under the
 26 16 redevelopment tax credit program and the housing enterprise
 26 17 zone tax incentives program if the property that is the subject
 26 18 of the project suffered a catastrophic fire during the 2014
 26 19 calendar year.
       LSB 1212HV (3) 86
       mm/sc
 20 19 fiscal year in Code section 15.119, and not more than $15
 20 20 million per fiscal year may be issued by the EDA under the
 20 21 program.  In addition, the maximum amount of tax credit that
 20 22 may be issued to an eligible business in any one calendar year
 20 23 shall not exceed $1 million or $500,000, depending on whether
 20 24 the eligible business has been operating in Iowa at the time of
 20 25 application for five or fewer years, or more than five years,
 20 26 respectively.  An eligible business shall not receive more than
 20 27 five tax credits under the program.  The EDA is required to
 20 28 issue tax credits on a first=come, first=served basis until the
 20 29 maximum amount of $15 million per fiscal year is reached.  If
 20 30 the amount of tax credits exceeds this amount in a fiscal year,
 20 31 the EDA is required to establish a wait list and give priority
 20 32 in subsequent years to the eligible businesses on the wait
 20 33 list.
 20 34    The division provides for the confidentiality of certain
 20 35 information under the program.  The identity of a tax credit
 21  1 recipient and the amount of the tax credit shall be considered
 21  2 public information under Code chapter 22 (examination of public
 21  3 records), but any other information or record in the possession
 21  4 of the EDA with respect to the program shall be presumed by
 21  5 the EDA to be a trade secret protected under Code chapter 550
 21  6 or common law and shall be kept confidential by the EDA unless
 21  7 otherwise ordered by a court.
 21  8    The division takes effect upon enactment and applies to
 21  9 renewable chemicals produced in Iowa from biomass feedstock on
 21 10 or after that date.  The division applies retroactively to tax
 21 11 years beginning on or after January 1, 2015.
 21 12    DIVISION II ==== ANGEL INVESTOR TAX CREDITS.   Division II
 21 13 makes several changes to the tax credit for investments in
 21 14 qualifying businesses and community=based seed capital funds,
 21 15 often referred to as the angel investor tax credits.  The
 21 16 division amends the purpose of the tax credit in Code section
 21 17 15E.41.  The division excludes investments in community=based
 21 18 seed capital funds from qualifying for the tax credit and
 21 19 makes several conforming amendments to remove references to
 21 20 community=based seed capital funds from the Code.
 21 21    The division modifies the amount and dollar limitation of
 21 22 the tax credit for a taxpayer.  The tax credit is increased
 21 23 from 20 percent to 25 percent of a taxpayer's equity investment
 21 24 in a qualifying business.  Under current law, a taxpayer cannot
 21 25 claim more than $50,000 of tax credit per investment in a
 21 26 qualifying business, and for each tax year a taxpayer and the
 21 27 taxpayer's affiliates cannot claim tax credits for more than
 21 28 five investments in five different qualifying businesses.  The
 21 29 division amends this dollar limitation to prohibit a natural
 21 30 person and the person's spouse, child, or sibling from claiming
 21 31 a combined amount of more than $100,000 in tax credits per tax
 21 32 year.
 21 33    The division also provides that no more than $500,000 in tax
 21 34 credits may be issued per tax year for equity investments in
 21 35 any one qualifying business.
 22  1 The division modifies the procedures for claiming the tax
 22  2 credit.  Under current law, the tax credit is not refundable
 22  3 but available for carryforward for up to five tax years.  The
 22  4 division makes the tax credit refundable for an investment
 22  5 made by a natural person, and for any other person reduces the
 22  6 carryforward period to three years.
 22  7    The division strikes a provision permitting the EDA
 22  8 to cooperate with small business development centers to
 22  9 disseminate information regarding the credits and to develop
 22 10 standard application forms, and requiring the EDA to distribute
 22 11 copies of the application forms to all community=based seed
 22 12 capital funds and potential individual investors.
 22 13    The division modifies the eligibility requirements for
 22 14 qualifying businesses.  The division strikes the requirement
 22 15 that a business have an owner that meets at least one of
 22 16 four qualifications relating to business education or
 22 17 business experience.  The division requires that a business
 22 18 be participating in an entrepreneurial assistance program,
 22 19 as defined in the division, but allows the EDA to waive this
 22 20 requirement if the business establishes that its owners,
 22 21 directors, officers, and employees have an appropriate level
 22 22 of experience such that an entrepreneurial assistance program
 22 23 would not materially change the prospects of the business.
 22 24 The EDA is allowed to consult with outside service providers
 22 25 in considering such a waiver.  The division increases from $5
 22 26 million to $10 million the maximum amount of net worth that
 22 27 a business may have to be considered a qualifying business.
 22 28 The division increases from $250,000 to $500,000 the amount of
 22 29 financing that a business must have in order to be considered a
 22 30 qualifying business, removes "near equity" from the types of
 22 31 financing that will be considered in that calculation, requires
 22 32 that the financing be secured at the time of application for
 22 33 the tax credits, and requires that the business have at least
 22 34 two investors at the time of application for the tax credits.
 22 35 These modified eligibility requirements apply to businesses
 23  1 that submit an application to the EDA to be registered as a
 23  2 qualifying business on or after the effective date of this
 23  3 division of the bill, and businesses that submitted such an
 23  4 application to the EDA before the effective date of this
 23  5 division of the bill shall be governed by current law.
 23  6    The division provides for the confidentiality of certain
 23  7 information with regard to the tax credit.  The identity of
 23  8 a qualifying business, the identity of an investor and the
 23  9 qualifying business in which the investor made an equity
 23 10 investment, and the total number and amount of tax credits
 23 11 issued shall be considered public information under Code
 23 12 chapter 22 (examination of public records), but any other
 23 13 information or record in the possession of the EDA with respect
 23 14 to the program shall be presumed by the EDA to be a trade secret
 23 15 protected under Code chapter 550 or common law and shall be
 23 16 kept confidential by the EDA unless otherwise ordered by a
 23 17 court.
 23 18    The division takes effect upon enactment and applies to
 23 19 equity investments in a qualifying business made on or after
 23 20 that date.  Equity investments in a qualifying business or
 23 21 community=based seed capital fund made prior to the effective
 23 22 date of the division shall be governed by current law.
 23 23    DIVISION III ==== ENTREPRENEUR INVESTMENT AWARDS PROGRAM.
 23 24  Division III amends the entrepreneur investment awards program
 23 25 administered by the EDA.  The division strikes provisions that
 23 26 prohibited the EDA from making awards under the program since
 23 27 July 1, 2014, and that required the EDA by December 31, 2014,
 23 28 to conduct a comprehensive review of the program and submit
 23 29 a report with specified information to the governor and the
 23 30 general assembly.
 23 31    The division modifies the purpose of the program to be
 23 32 to provide financial assistance to eligible entrepreneurial
 23 33 assistance providers (provider) that provide technical and
 23 34 financial assistance to entrepreneurs and start=up companies
 23 35 seeking to create, locate, or expand a business in Iowa.
 24  1 "Financial assistance" is defined in the division.
 24  2    The division changes the requirements for receiving an
 24  3 award.  To be eligible to receive an award under current
 24  4 law, an entrepreneurial assistance program must have been
 24  5 an Iowa=based business, expended at least $500,000 during
 24  6 the previous fiscal year to provide technical and financial

 24  9 in Iowa that intends to derive more than 10 percent of its
 24 10 gross sales from markets outside Iowa; and must have engaged
 24 11 and communicated with certain other programs, funding sources,
 24 12 and entities for its entrepreneur clients.  The division
 24 13 amends the eligibility for receiving financial assistance to
 24 14 require that a provider have its principal place of operations
 24 15 in Iowa and that the provider offer a comprehensive set of
 24 16 business development services to emerging and early=stage
 24 17 innovation companies to assist in the creation, location,
 24 18 growth, and long=term success of the company in Iowa.
 24 19 "Business development services" is defined in the division.
 24 20 Business development services may be performed at the physical
 24 21 location of the provider or the company and may be provided in
 24 22 consideration of equity participation in the company, a fee for
 24 23 services, or a membership agreement with the company.
 24 24    Under current law, the EDA board could approve, deny, or
 24 25 defer each application for a grant, and was required to award
 24 26 grants on a first=come, first=served basis.  The division
 24 27 specifies that the EDA board has the discretion to approve,
 24 28 deny, or defer each application for financial assistance and
 24 29 that the amount of financial assistance awarded to a provider
 24 30 is within the discretion of the EDA.  The division requires
 24 31 the EDA to award financial assistance on a competitive basis
 24 32 and allows the EDA to develop scoring criteria and establish
 24 33 minimum requirements for the receipt of a financial assistance
 24 34 award.
 24 35    In addition to the four factors relating to the provider's
 25  1 professional staff that the EDA may consider under current
 25  2 law in deciding whether to award financial assistance, the
 25  3 division provides that the EDA may also consider the service
 25  4 model and likelihood of success of the provider, the provider's
 25  5 similarity to other successful providers in the country, and
 25  6 the provider's financial need.
 25  7    The division modifies the maximum award amount for a
 25  8 recipient.  Under current law, a grant to an entrepreneur
 25  9 assistance program cannot exceed the lesser of 25 percent of
 25 10 the funds expended by the program during the previous fiscal
 25 11 year, 100 percent of the funds raised from certain persons
 25 12 by the program during the previous fiscal year, or $200,000.
 25 13 The division provides that the amount of financial assistance
 25 14 awarded to any one provider shall not exceed $200,000.
 25 15    The division modifies the permitted use of funds received
 25 16 under the program.  Under current law, grants are only
 25 17 permitted to be used for the purpose of operating costs
 25 18 incurred by the program.  The division specifies that financial
 25 19 assistance awarded to a provider shall only be used for
 25 20 the purpose of operating costs incurred by the provider in
 25 21 the provision of business development services to emerging
 25 22 and early=stage innovation companies in Iowa.  The division
 25 23 further requires that such financial assistance shall not be
 25 24 distributed to owners or investors of the company to which the
 25 25 business development services are being provided and shall not
 25 26 be provided to other persons assisting with the provision of
 25 27 the services.
 25 28    Under current law, an entrepreneurial assistance provider is
 25 29 required to accept client referrals from the EDA as a condition
 25 30 of receiving a grant.  The division provides that the EDA may
 25 31 make client referrals to eligible providers.
 25 32    DIVISION IV ==== MISCELLANEOUS CHANGES.  Division IV makes
 25 33 several miscellaneous changes to other EDA programs.  The
 25 34 division amends the sales and use tax refund available under
 25 35 the workforce housing tax incentive program.  That refund
 26  1 is available for sales and use tax paid prior to project
 26  2 completion, which is currently defined to mean the first date
 26  3 upon which the average annualized production of finished
 26  4 product for the preceding 90=day period at the manufacturing
 26  5 facility operated by the eligible business is at least 50
 26  6 percent of the initial design capacity of the facility.  The
 26  7 division amends the definition of "project completion" to mean
 26  8 the date on which the EDA notifies the department of revenue
 26  9 that all applicable requirements of a workforce housing tax
 26 10 incentive program agreement are satisfied.  This provision
 26 11 takes effect upon enactment and applies retroactively to July
 26 12 1, 2014, for all workforce housing tax incentive agreements
 26 13 entered into on or after that date.
 26 14    The division allows the EDA to extend the project
 26 15 completion date for a project awarded tax incentives under the

 20 20 million per fiscal year may be issued by the EDA under the
 20 21 program.  In addition, the maximum amount of tax credit that
 20 22 may be issued to an eligible business in any one calendar year
 20 23 shall not exceed $1 million or $500,000, depending on whether
 20 24 the eligible business has been operating in Iowa at the time of
 20 25 application for five or fewer years, or more than five years,
 20 26 respectively.  An eligible business shall not receive more than
 20 27 five tax credits under the program.  The EDA is required to
 20 28 issue tax credits on a first=come, first=served basis until the
 20 29 maximum amount of $15 million per fiscal year is reached.  If
 20 30 the amount of tax credits exceeds this amount in a fiscal year,
 20 31 the EDA is required to establish a wait list and give priority
 20 32 in subsequent years to the eligible businesses on the wait
 20 33 list.
 20 34    The division provides for the confidentiality of certain
 20 35 information under the program.  The identity of a tax credit
 21  1 recipient and the amount of the tax credit shall be considered
 21  2 public information under Code chapter 22 (examination of public
 21  3 records), but any other information or record in the possession
 21  4 of the EDA with respect to the program shall be presumed by
 21  5 the EDA to be a trade secret protected under Code chapter 550
 21  6 or common law and shall be kept confidential by the EDA unless
 21  7 otherwise ordered by a court.
 21  8    The division takes effect upon enactment and applies to
 21  9 renewable chemicals produced in Iowa from biomass feedstock on
 21 10 or after that date.  The division applies retroactively to tax
 21 11 years beginning on or after January 1, 2015.
 21 12    DIVISION II ==== ANGEL INVESTOR TAX CREDITS.   Division II
 21 13 makes several changes to the tax credit for investments in
 21 14 qualifying businesses and community=based seed capital funds,
 21 15 often referred to as the angel investor tax credits.  The
 21 16 division amends the purpose of the tax credit in Code section
 21 17 15E.41.  The division excludes investments in community=based
 21 18 seed capital funds from qualifying for the tax credit and
 21 19 makes several conforming amendments to remove references to
 21 20 community=based seed capital funds from the Code.
 21 21    The division modifies the amount and dollar limitation of
 21 22 the tax credit for a taxpayer.  The tax credit is increased
 21 23 from 20 percent to 25 percent of a taxpayer's equity investment
 21 24 in a qualifying business.  Under current law, a taxpayer cannot
 21 25 claim more than $50,000 of tax credit per investment in a
 21 26 qualifying business, and for each tax year a taxpayer and the
 21 27 taxpayer's affiliates cannot claim tax credits for more than
 21 28 five investments in five different qualifying businesses.  The
 21 29 division amends this dollar limitation to prohibit a natural
 21 30 person and the person's spouse, child, or sibling from claiming
 21 31 a combined amount of more than $100,000 in tax credits per tax
 21 32 year.
 21 33    The division also provides that no more than $500,000 in tax
 21 34 credits may be issued per tax year for equity investments in
 21 35 any one qualifying business.
 22  1 The division modifies the procedures for claiming the tax
 22  2 credit.  Under current law, the tax credit is not refundable
 22  3 but available for carryforward for up to five tax years.  The
 22  4 division makes the tax credit refundable for an investment
 22  5 made by a natural person, and for any other person reduces the
 22  6 carryforward period to three years.
 22  7    The division strikes a provision permitting the EDA
 22  8 to cooperate with small business development centers to
 22  9 disseminate information regarding the credits and to develop
 22 10 standard application forms, and requiring the EDA to distribute
 22 11 copies of the application forms to all community=based seed
 22 12 capital funds and potential individual investors.
 22 13    The division modifies the eligibility requirements for
 22 14 qualifying businesses.  The division strikes the requirement
 22 15 that a business have an owner that meets at least one of
 22 16 four qualifications relating to business education or
 22 17 business experience.  The division requires that a business
 22 18 be participating in an entrepreneurial assistance program,
 22 19 as defined in the division, but allows the EDA to waive this
 22 20 requirement if the business establishes that its owners,
 22 21 directors, officers, and employees have an appropriate level
 22 22 of experience such that an entrepreneurial assistance program
 22 23 would not materially change the prospects of the business.
 22 24 The EDA is allowed to consult with outside service providers
 22 25 in considering such a waiver.  The division increases from $5
 22 26 million to $10 million the maximum amount of net worth that
 22 27 a business may have to be considered a qualifying business.
 22 28 The division increases from $250,000 to $500,000 the amount of
 22 29 financing that a business must have in order to be considered a
 22 30 qualifying business, removes "near equity" from the types of
 22 31 financing that will be considered in that calculation, requires
 22 32 that the financing be secured at the time of application for
 22 33 the tax credits, and requires that the business have at least
 22 34 two investors at the time of application for the tax credits.
 22 35 These modified eligibility requirements apply to businesses
 23  1 that submit an application to the EDA to be registered as a
 23  2 qualifying business on or after the effective date of this
 23  3 division of the bill, and businesses that submitted such an
 23  4 application to the EDA before the effective date of this
 23  5 division of the bill shall be governed by current law.
 23  6    The division provides for the confidentiality of certain
 23  7 information with regard to the tax credit.  The identity of
 23  8 a qualifying business, the identity of an investor and the
 23  9 qualifying business in which the investor made an equity
 23 10 investment, and the total number and amount of tax credits
 23 11 issued shall be considered public information under Code
 23 12 chapter 22 (examination of public records), but any other
 23 13 information or record in the possession of the EDA with respect
 23 14 to the program shall be presumed by the EDA to be a trade secret
 23 15 protected under Code chapter 550 or common law and shall be
 23 16 kept confidential by the EDA unless otherwise ordered by a
 23 17 court.
 23 18    The division takes effect upon enactment and applies to
 23 19 equity investments in a qualifying business made on or after
 23 20 that date.  Equity investments in a qualifying business or
 23 21 community=based seed capital fund made prior to the effective
 23 22 date of the division shall be governed by current law.
 23 23    DIVISION III ==== ENTREPRENEUR INVESTMENT AWARDS PROGRAM.
 23 24  Division III amends the entrepreneur investment awards program
 23 25 administered by the EDA.  The division strikes provisions that
 23 26 prohibited the EDA from making awards under the program since
 23 27 July 1, 2014, and that required the EDA by December 31, 2014,
 23 28 to conduct a comprehensive review of the program and submit
 23 29 a report with specified information to the governor and the
 23 30 general assembly.
 23 31    The division modifies the purpose of the program to be
 23 32 to provide financial assistance to eligible entrepreneurial
 23 33 assistance providers (provider) that provide technical and
 23 34 financial assistance to entrepreneurs and start=up companies
 23 35 seeking to create, locate, or expand a business in Iowa.
 24  1 "Financial assistance" is defined in the division.
 24  2    The division changes the requirements for receiving an
 24  3 award.  To be eligible to receive an award under current
 24  4 law, an entrepreneurial assistance program must have been
 24  5 an Iowa=based business, expended at least $500,000 during
 24  6 the previous fiscal year to provide technical and financial
 24  7 assistance services that meet the broad=based needs of
 24  8 entrepreneurs seeking to create, locate, or expand a business
 24  9 in Iowa that intends to derive more than 10 percent of its
 24 10 gross sales from markets outside Iowa; and must have engaged
 24 11 and communicated with certain other programs, funding sources,
 24 12 and entities for its entrepreneur clients.  The division
 24 13 amends the eligibility for receiving financial assistance to
 24 14 require that a provider have its principal place of operations
 24 15 in Iowa and that the provider offer a comprehensive set of
 24 16 business development services to emerging and early=stage
 24 17 innovation companies to assist in the creation, location,
 24 18 growth, and long=term success of the company in Iowa.
 24 19 "Business development services" is defined in the division.
 24 20 Business development services may be performed at the physical
 24 21 location of the provider or the company and may be provided in
 24 22 consideration of equity participation in the company, a fee for
 24 23 services, or a membership agreement with the company.
 24 24    Under current law, the EDA board could approve, deny, or
 24 25 defer each application for a grant, and was required to award
 24 26 grants on a first=come, first=served basis.  The division
 24 27 specifies that the EDA board has the discretion to approve,
 24 28 deny, or defer each application for financial assistance and
 24 29 that the amount of financial assistance awarded to a provider
 24 30 is within the discretion of the EDA.  The division requires
 24 31 the EDA to award financial assistance on a competitive basis
 24 32 and allows the EDA to develop scoring criteria and establish
 24 33 minimum requirements for the receipt of a financial assistance
 24 34 award.
 24 35    In addition to the four factors relating to the provider's
 25  1 professional staff that the EDA may consider under current
 25  2 law in deciding whether to award financial assistance, the
 25  3 division provides that the EDA may also consider the service
 25  4 model and likelihood of success of the provider, the provider's
 25  5 similarity to other successful providers in the country, and
 25  6 the provider's financial need.
 25  7    The division modifies the maximum award amount for a
 25  8 recipient.  Under current law, a grant to an entrepreneur
 25  9 assistance program cannot exceed the lesser of 25 percent of
 25 10 the funds expended by the program during the previous fiscal
 25 11 year, 100 percent of the funds raised from certain persons
 25 12 by the program during the previous fiscal year, or $200,000.
 25 13 The division provides that the amount of financial assistance
 25 14 awarded to any one provider shall not exceed $200,000.
 25 15    The division modifies the permitted use of funds received
 25 16 under the program.  Under current law, grants are only
 25 17 permitted to be used for the purpose of operating costs
 25 18 incurred by the program.  The division specifies that financial
 25 19 assistance awarded to a provider shall only be used for
 25 20 the purpose of operating costs incurred by the provider in
 25 21 the provision of business development services to emerging
 25 22 and early=stage innovation companies in Iowa.  The division
 25 23 further requires that such financial assistance shall not be
 25 24 distributed to owners or investors of the company to which the
 25 25 business development services are being provided and shall not
 25 26 be provided to other persons assisting with the provision of
 25 27 the services.
 25 28    Under current law, an entrepreneurial assistance provider is
 25 29 required to accept client referrals from the EDA as a condition
 25 30 of receiving a grant.  The division provides that the EDA may
 25 31 make client referrals to eligible providers.
 25 32    DIVISION IV ==== MISCELLANEOUS CHANGES.  Division IV makes
 25 33 several miscellaneous changes to other EDA programs.  The
 25 34 division amends the sales and use tax refund available under
 25 35 the workforce housing tax incentive program.  That refund
 26  1 is available for sales and use tax paid prior to project
 26  2 completion, which is currently defined to mean the first date
 26  3 upon which the average annualized production of finished
 26  4 product for the preceding 90=day period at the manufacturing
 26  5 facility operated by the eligible business is at least 50
 26  6 percent of the initial design capacity of the facility.  The
 26  7 division amends the definition of "project completion" to mean
 26  8 the date on which the EDA notifies the department of revenue
 26  9 that all applicable requirements of a workforce housing tax
 26 10 incentive program agreement are satisfied.  This provision
 26 11 takes effect upon enactment and applies retroactively to July
 26 12 1, 2014, for all workforce housing tax incentive agreements
 26 13 entered into on or after that date.
 26 14    The division allows the EDA to extend the project
 26 15 completion date for a project awarded tax incentives under the
 26 16 redevelopment tax credit program and the housing enterprise
 26 17 zone tax incentives program if the property that is the subject
 26 18 of the project suffered a catastrophic fire during the 2014
 26 19 calendar year.

 20 21 program.  In addition, the maximum amount of tax credit that
 20 22 may be issued to an eligible business in any one calendar year
 20 23 shall not exceed $1 million or $500,000, depending on whether
 20 24 the eligible business has been operating in Iowa at the time of
 20 25 application for five or fewer years, or more than five years,
 20 26 respectively.  An eligible business shall not receive more than
 20 27 five tax credits under the program.  The EDA is required to
 20 28 issue tax credits on a first=come, first=served basis until the
 20 29 maximum amount of $15 million per fiscal year is reached.  If
 20 30 the amount of tax credits exceeds this amount in a fiscal year,
 20 31 the EDA is required to establish a wait list and give priority
 20 32 in subsequent years to the eligible businesses on the wait
 20 33 list.
 20 34    The division provides for the confidentiality of certain
 20 35 information under the program.  The identity of a tax credit
 21  1 recipient and the amount of the tax credit shall be considered
 21  2 public information under Code chapter 22 (examination of public
 21  3 records), but any other information or record in the possession
 21  4 of the EDA with respect to the program shall be presumed by
 21  5 the EDA to be a trade secret protected under Code chapter 550
 21  6 or common law and shall be kept confidential by the EDA unless
 21  7 otherwise ordered by a court.
 21  8    The division takes effect upon enactment and applies to
 21  9 renewable chemicals produced in Iowa from biomass feedstock on
 21 10 or after that date.  The division applies retroactively to tax
 21 11 years beginning on or after January 1, 2015.
 21 12    DIVISION II ==== ANGEL INVESTOR TAX CREDITS.   Division II
 21 13 makes several changes to the tax credit for investments in
 21 14 qualifying businesses and community=based seed capital funds,
 21 15 often referred to as the angel investor tax credits.  The
 21 16 division amends the purpose of the tax credit in Code section
 21 17 15E.41.  The division excludes investments in community=based
 21 18 seed capital funds from qualifying for the tax credit and
 21 19 makes several conforming amendments to remove references to
 21 20 community=based seed capital funds from the Code.
 21 21    The division modifies the amount and dollar limitation of
 21 22 the tax credit for a taxpayer.  The tax credit is increased
 21 23 from 20 percent to 25 percent of a taxpayer's equity investment
 21 24 in a qualifying business.  Under current law, a taxpayer cannot
 21 25 claim more than $50,000 of tax credit per investment in a
 21 26 qualifying business, and for each tax year a taxpayer and the
 21 27 taxpayer's affiliates cannot claim tax credits for more than
 21 28 five investments in five different qualifying businesses.  The
 21 29 division amends this dollar limitation to prohibit a natural
 21 30 person and the person's spouse, child, or sibling from claiming
 21 31 a combined amount of more than $100,000 in tax credits per tax
 21 32 year.
 21 33    The division also provides that no more than $500,000 in tax
 21 34 credits may be issued per tax year for equity investments in
 21 35 any one qualifying business.
 22  1 The division modifies the procedures for claiming the tax
 22  2 credit.  Under current law, the tax credit is not refundable
 22  3 but available for carryforward for up to five tax years.  The
 22  4 division makes the tax credit refundable for an investment
 22  5 made by a natural person, and for any other person reduces the
 22  6 carryforward period to three years.
 22  7    The division strikes a provision permitting the EDA
 22  8 to cooperate with small business development centers to
 22  9 disseminate information regarding the credits and to develop
 22 10 standard application forms, and requiring the EDA to distribute
 22 11 copies of the application forms to all community=based seed
 22 12 capital funds and potential individual investors.
 22 13    The division modifies the eligibility requirements for
 22 14 qualifying businesses.  The division strikes the requirement
 22 15 that a business have an owner that meets at least one of
 22 16 four qualifications relating to business education or
 22 17 business experience.  The division requires that a business
 22 18 be participating in an entrepreneurial assistance program,
 22 19 as defined in the division, but allows the EDA to waive this
 22 20 requirement if the business establishes that its owners,
 22 21 directors, officers, and employees have an appropriate level
 22 22 of experience such that an entrepreneurial assistance program
 22 23 would not materially change the prospects of the business.
 22 24 The EDA is allowed to consult with outside service providers
 22 25 in considering such a waiver.  The division increases from $5
 22 26 million to $10 million the maximum amount of net worth that
 22 27 a business may have to be considered a qualifying business.
 22 28 The division increases from $250,000 to $500,000 the amount of
 22 29 financing that a business must have in order to be considered a
 22 30 qualifying business, removes "near equity" from the types of
 22 31 financing that will be considered in that calculation, requires
 22 32 that the financing be secured at the time of application for
 22 33 the tax credits, and requires that the business have at least
 22 34 two investors at the time of application for the tax credits.
 22 35 These modified eligibility requirements apply to businesses
 23  1 that submit an application to the EDA to be registered as a
 23  2 qualifying business on or after the effective date of this
 23  3 division of the bill, and businesses that submitted such an
 23  4 application to the EDA before the effective date of this
 23  5 division of the bill shall be governed by current law.
 23  6    The division provides for the confidentiality of certain
 23  7 information with regard to the tax credit.  The identity of
 23  8 a qualifying business, the identity of an investor and the
 23  9 qualifying business in which the investor made an equity
 23 10 investment, and the total number and amount of tax credits
 23 11 issued shall be considered public information under Code
 23 12 chapter 22 (examination of public records), but any other
 23 13 information or record in the possession of the EDA with respect
 23 14 to the program shall be presumed by the EDA to be a trade secret
 23 15 protected under Code chapter 550 or common law and shall be
 23 16 kept confidential by the EDA unless otherwise ordered by a
 23 17 court.
 23 18    The division takes effect upon enactment and applies to
 23 19 equity investments in a qualifying business made on or after
 23 20 that date.  Equity investments in a qualifying business or
 23 21 community=based seed capital fund made prior to the effective
 23 22 date of the division shall be governed by current law.
 23 23    DIVISION III ==== ENTREPRENEUR INVESTMENT AWARDS PROGRAM.
 23 24  Division III amends the entrepreneur investment awards program
 23 25 administered by the EDA.  The division strikes provisions that
 23 26 prohibited the EDA from making awards under the program since
 23 27 July 1, 2014, and that required the EDA by December 31, 2014,
 23 28 to conduct a comprehensive review of the program and submit
 23 29 a report with specified information to the governor and the
 23 30 general assembly.
 23 31    The division modifies the purpose of the program to be
 23 32 to provide financial assistance to eligible entrepreneurial
 23 33 assistance providers (provider) that provide technical and
 23 34 financial assistance to entrepreneurs and start=up companies
 23 35 seeking to create, locate, or expand a business in Iowa.
 24  1 "Financial assistance" is defined in the division.
 24  2    The division changes the requirements for receiving an
 24  3 award.  To be eligible to receive an award under current
 24  4 law, an entrepreneurial assistance program must have been
 24  5 an Iowa=based business, expended at least $500,000 during
 24  6 the previous fiscal year to provide technical and financial
 24  7 assistance services that meet the broad=based needs of
 24  8 entrepreneurs seeking to create, locate, or expand a business
 24  9 in Iowa that intends to derive more than 10 percent of its
 24 10 gross sales from markets outside Iowa; and must have engaged
 24 11 and communicated with certain other programs, funding sources,
 24 12 and entities for its entrepreneur clients.  The division
 24 13 amends the eligibility for receiving financial assistance to
 24 14 require that a provider have its principal place of operations
 24 15 in Iowa and that the provider offer a comprehensive set of
 24 16 business development services to emerging and early=stage
 24 17 innovation companies to assist in the creation, location,
 24 18 growth, and long=term success of the company in Iowa.
 24 19 "Business development services" is defined in the division.
 24 20 Business development services may be performed at the physical
 24 21 location of the provider or the company and may be provided in
 24 22 consideration of equity participation in the company, a fee for
 24 23 services, or a membership agreement with the company.
 24 24    Under current law, the EDA board could approve, deny, or
 24 25 defer each application for a grant, and was required to award
 24 26 grants on a first=come, first=served basis.  The division
 24 27 specifies that the EDA board has the discretion to approve,
 24 28 deny, or defer each application for financial assistance and
 24 29 that the amount of financial assistance awarded to a provider
 24 30 is within the discretion of the EDA.  The division requires
 24 31 the EDA to award financial assistance on a competitive basis
 24 32 and allows the EDA to develop scoring criteria and establish
 24 33 minimum requirements for the receipt of a financial assistance
 24 34 award.
 24 35    In addition to the four factors relating to the provider's
 25  1 professional staff that the EDA may consider under current
 25  2 law in deciding whether to award financial assistance, the
 25  3 division provides that the EDA may also consider the service
 25  4 model and likelihood of success of the provider, the provider's
 25  5 similarity to other successful providers in the country, and
 25  6 the provider's financial need.
 25  7    The division modifies the maximum award amount for a
 25  8 recipient.  Under current law, a grant to an entrepreneur
 25  9 assistance program cannot exceed the lesser of 25 percent of
 25 10 the funds expended by the program during the previous fiscal
 25 11 year, 100 percent of the funds raised from certain persons
 25 12 by the program during the previous fiscal year, or $200,000.
 25 13 The division provides that the amount of financial assistance
 25 14 awarded to any one provider shall not exceed $200,000.
 25 15    The division modifies the permitted use of funds received
 25 16 under the program.  Under current law, grants are only
 25 17 permitted to be used for the purpose of operating costs
 25 18 incurred by the program.  The division specifies that financial
 25 19 assistance awarded to a provider shall only be used for
 25 20 the purpose of operating costs incurred by the provider in
 25 21 the provision of business development services to emerging
 25 22 and early=stage innovation companies in Iowa.  The division
 25 23 further requires that such financial assistance shall not be
 25 24 distributed to owners or investors of the company to which the
 25 25 business development services are being provided and shall not
 25 26 be provided to other persons assisting with the provision of
 25 27 the services.
 25 28    Under current law, an entrepreneurial assistance provider is
 25 29 required to accept client referrals from the EDA as a condition
 25 30 of receiving a grant.  The division provides that the EDA may
 25 31 make client referrals to eligible providers.
 25 32    DIVISION IV ==== MISCELLANEOUS CHANGES.  Division IV makes
 25 33 several miscellaneous changes to other EDA programs.  The
 25 34 division amends the sales and use tax refund available under
 25 35 the workforce housing tax incentive program.  That refund
 26  1 is available for sales and use tax paid prior to project
 26  2 completion, which is currently defined to mean the first date
 26  3 upon which the average annualized production of finished
 26  4 product for the preceding 90=day period at the manufacturing
 26  5 facility operated by the eligible business is at least 50
 26  6 percent of the initial design capacity of the facility.  The
 26  7 division amends the definition of "project completion" to mean
 26  8 the date on which the EDA notifies the department of revenue
 26  9 that all applicable requirements of a workforce housing tax
 26 10 incentive program agreement are satisfied.  This provision
 26 11 takes effect upon enactment and applies retroactively to July
 26 12 1, 2014, for all workforce housing tax incentive agreements
 26 13 entered into on or after that date.
 26 14    The division allows the EDA to extend the project
 26 15 completion date for a project awarded tax incentives under the
 26 16 redevelopment tax credit program and the housing enterprise
 26 17 zone tax incentives program if the property that is the subject
 26 18 of the project suffered a catastrophic fire during the 2014

 20 23 shall not exceed $1 million or $500,000, depending on whether
 20 24 the eligible business has been operating in Iowa at the time of
 20 25 application for five or fewer years, or more than five years,
 20 26 respectively.  An eligible business shall not receive more than
 20 27 five tax credits under the program.  The EDA is required to
 20 28 issue tax credits on a first=come, first=served basis until the
 20 29 maximum amount of $15 million per fiscal year is reached.  If
 20 30 the amount of tax credits exceeds this amount in a fiscal year,
 20 31 the EDA is required to establish a wait list and give priority
 20 32 in subsequent years to the eligible businesses on the wait
 20 33 list.
 20 34    The division provides for the confidentiality of certain
 20 35 information under the program.  The identity of a tax credit
 21  1 recipient and the amount of the tax credit shall be considered
 21  2 public information under Code chapter 22 (examination of public
 21  3 records), but any other information or record in the possession
 21  4 of the EDA with respect to the program shall be presumed by
 21  5 the EDA to be a trade secret protected under Code chapter 550
 21  6 or common law and shall be kept confidential by the EDA unless
 21  7 otherwise ordered by a court.
 21  8    The division takes effect upon enactment and applies to
 21  9 renewable chemicals produced in Iowa from biomass feedstock on
 21 10 or after that date.  The division applies retroactively to tax
 21 11 years beginning on or after January 1, 2015.
 21 12    DIVISION II ==== ANGEL INVESTOR TAX CREDITS.   Division II
 21 13 makes several changes to the tax credit for investments in
 21 14 qualifying businesses and community=based seed capital funds,
 21 15 often referred to as the angel investor tax credits.  The
 21 16 division amends the purpose of the tax credit in Code section
 21 17 15E.41.  The division excludes investments in community=based
 21 18 seed capital funds from qualifying for the tax credit and
 21 19 makes several conforming amendments to remove references to
 21 20 community=based seed capital funds from the Code.
 21 21    The division modifies the amount and dollar limitation of
 21 22 the tax credit for a taxpayer.  The tax credit is increased
 21 23 from 20 percent to 25 percent of a taxpayer's equity investment
 21 24 in a qualifying business.  Under current law, a taxpayer cannot
 21 25 claim more than $50,000 of tax credit per investment in a
 21 26 qualifying business, and for each tax year a taxpayer and the
 21 27 taxpayer's affiliates cannot claim tax credits for more than
 21 28 five investments in five different qualifying businesses.  The
 21 29 division amends this dollar limitation to prohibit a natural
 21 30 person and the person's spouse, child, or sibling from claiming
 21 31 a combined amount of more than $100,000 in tax credits per tax
 21 32 year.
 21 33    The division also provides that no more than $500,000 in tax
 21 34 credits may be issued per tax year for equity investments in
 21 35 any one qualifying business.
 22  1 The division modifies the procedures for claiming the tax
 22  2 credit.  Under current law, the tax credit is not refundable
 22  3 but available for carryforward for up to five tax years.  The
 22  4 division makes the tax credit refundable for an investment
 22  5 made by a natural person, and for any other person reduces the
 22  6 carryforward period to three years.
 22  7    The division strikes a provision permitting the EDA
 22  8 to cooperate with small business development centers to
 22  9 disseminate information regarding the credits and to develop
 22 10 standard application forms, and requiring the EDA to distribute
 22 11 copies of the application forms to all community=based seed
 22 12 capital funds and potential individual investors.
 22 13    The division modifies the eligibility requirements for
 22 14 qualifying businesses.  The division strikes the requirement
 22 15 that a business have an owner that meets at least one of
 22 16 four qualifications relating to business education or
 22 17 business experience.  The division requires that a business
 22 18 be participating in an entrepreneurial assistance program,
 22 19 as defined in the division, but allows the EDA to waive this
 22 20 requirement if the business establishes that its owners,
 22 21 directors, officers, and employees have an appropriate level
 22 22 of experience such that an entrepreneurial assistance program
 22 23 would not materially change the prospects of the business.
 22 24 The EDA is allowed to consult with outside service providers
 22 25 in considering such a waiver.  The division increases from $5
 22 26 million to $10 million the maximum amount of net worth that
 22 27 a business may have to be considered a qualifying business.
 22 28 The division increases from $250,000 to $500,000 the amount of
 22 29 financing that a business must have in order to be considered a
 22 30 qualifying business, removes "near equity" from the types of
 22 31 financing that will be considered in that calculation, requires
 22 32 that the financing be secured at the time of application for
 22 33 the tax credits, and requires that the business have at least
 22 34 two investors at the time of application for the tax credits.
 22 35 These modified eligibility requirements apply to businesses
 23  1 that submit an application to the EDA to be registered as a
 23  2 qualifying business on or after the effective date of this
 23  3 division of the bill, and businesses that submitted such an
 23  4 application to the EDA before the effective date of this
 23  5 division of the bill shall be governed by current law.
 23  6    The division provides for the confidentiality of certain
 23  7 information with regard to the tax credit.  The identity of
 23  8 a qualifying business, the identity of an investor and the
 23  9 qualifying business in which the investor made an equity
 23 10 investment, and the total number and amount of tax credits
 23 11 issued shall be considered public information under Code
 23 12 chapter 22 (examination of public records), but any other
 23 13 information or record in the possession of the EDA with respect
 23 14 to the program shall be presumed by the EDA to be a trade secret
 23 15 protected under Code chapter 550 or common law and shall be
 23 16 kept confidential by the EDA unless otherwise ordered by a
 23 17 court.
 23 18    The division takes effect upon enactment and applies to
 23 19 equity investments in a qualifying business made on or after
 23 20 that date.  Equity investments in a qualifying business or
 23 21 community=based seed capital fund made prior to the effective
 23 22 date of the division shall be governed by current law.
 23 23    DIVISION III ==== ENTREPRENEUR INVESTMENT AWARDS PROGRAM.
 23 24  Division III amends the entrepreneur investment awards program
 23 25 administered by the EDA.  The division strikes provisions that
 23 26 prohibited the EDA from making awards under the program since
 23 27 July 1, 2014, and that required the EDA by December 31, 2014,
 23 28 to conduct a comprehensive review of the program and submit
 23 29 a report with specified information to the governor and the
 23 30 general assembly.
 23 31    The division modifies the purpose of the program to be
 23 32 to provide financial assistance to eligible entrepreneurial
 23 33 assistance providers (provider) that provide technical and
 23 34 financial assistance to entrepreneurs and start=up companies
 23 35 seeking to create, locate, or expand a business in Iowa.
 24  1 "Financial assistance" is defined in the division.
 24  2    The division changes the requirements for receiving an
 24  3 award.  To be eligible to receive an award under current
 24  4 law, an entrepreneurial assistance program must have been
 24  5 an Iowa=based business, expended at least $500,000 during
 24  6 the previous fiscal year to provide technical and financial
 24  7 assistance services that meet the broad=based needs of
 24  8 entrepreneurs seeking to create, locate, or expand a business
 24  9 in Iowa that intends to derive more than 10 percent of its
 24 10 gross sales from markets outside Iowa; and must have engaged
 24 11 and communicated with certain other programs, funding sources,
 24 12 and entities for its entrepreneur clients.  The division
 24 13 amends the eligibility for receiving financial assistance to
 24 14 require that a provider have its principal place of operations
 24 15 in Iowa and that the provider offer a comprehensive set of
 24 16 business development services to emerging and early=stage
 24 17 innovation companies to assist in the creation, location,
 24 18 growth, and long=term success of the company in Iowa.
 24 19 "Business development services" is defined in the division.
 24 20 Business development services may be performed at the physical
 24 21 location of the provider or the company and may be provided in
 24 22 consideration of equity participation in the company, a fee for
 24 23 services, or a membership agreement with the company.
 24 24    Under current law, the EDA board could approve, deny, or
 24 25 defer each application for a grant, and was required to award
 24 26 grants on a first=come, first=served basis.  The division
 24 27 specifies that the EDA board has the discretion to approve,
 24 28 deny, or defer each application for financial assistance and
 24 29 that the amount of financial assistance awarded to a provider
 24 30 is within the discretion of the EDA.  The division requires
 24 31 the EDA to award financial assistance on a competitive basis
 24 32 and allows the EDA to develop scoring criteria and establish
 24 33 minimum requirements for the receipt of a financial assistance
 24 34 award.
 24 35    In addition to the four factors relating to the provider's
 25  1 professional staff that the EDA may consider under current
 25  2 law in deciding whether to award financial assistance, the
 25  3 division provides that the EDA may also consider the service
 25  4 model and likelihood of success of the provider, the provider's
 25  5 similarity to other successful providers in the country, and
 25  6 the provider's financial need.
 25  7    The division modifies the maximum award amount for a
 25  8 recipient.  Under current law, a grant to an entrepreneur
 25  9 assistance program cannot exceed the lesser of 25 percent of
 25 10 the funds expended by the program during the previous fiscal
 25 11 year, 100 percent of the funds raised from certain persons
 25 12 by the program during the previous fiscal year, or $200,000.
 25 13 The division provides that the amount of financial assistance
 25 14 awarded to any one provider shall not exceed $200,000.
 25 15    The division modifies the permitted use of funds received
 25 16 under the program.  Under current law, grants are only
 25 17 permitted to be used for the purpose of operating costs
 25 18 incurred by the program.  The division specifies that financial
 25 19 assistance awarded to a provider shall only be used for
 25 20 the purpose of operating costs incurred by the provider in
 25 21 the provision of business development services to emerging
 25 22 and early=stage innovation companies in Iowa.  The division
 25 23 further requires that such financial assistance shall not be
 25 24 distributed to owners or investors of the company to which the
 25 25 business development services are being provided and shall not
 25 26 be provided to other persons assisting with the provision of
 25 27 the services.
 25 28    Under current law, an entrepreneurial assistance provider is
 25 29 required to accept client referrals from the EDA as a condition
 25 30 of receiving a grant.  The division provides that the EDA may
 25 31 make client referrals to eligible providers.
 25 32    DIVISION IV ==== MISCELLANEOUS CHANGES.  Division IV makes
 25 33 several miscellaneous changes to other EDA programs.  The
 25 34 division amends the sales and use tax refund available under
 25 35 the workforce housing tax incentive program.  That refund
 26  1 is available for sales and use tax paid prior to project
 26  2 completion, which is currently defined to mean the first date
 26  3 upon which the average annualized production of finished
 26  4 product for the preceding 90=day period at the manufacturing
 26  5 facility operated by the eligible business is at least 50
 26  6 percent of the initial design capacity of the facility.  The
 26  7 division amends the definition of "project completion" to mean
 26  8 the date on which the EDA notifies the department of revenue
 26  9 that all applicable requirements of a workforce housing tax
 26 10 incentive program agreement are satisfied.  This provision
 26 11 takes effect upon enactment and applies retroactively to July
 26 12 1, 2014, for all workforce housing tax incentive agreements
 26 13 entered into on or after that date.
 26 14    The division allows the EDA to extend the project
 26 15 completion date for a project awarded tax incentives under the
 26 16 redevelopment tax credit program and the housing enterprise
 26 17 zone tax incentives program if the property that is the subject
 26 18 of the project suffered a catastrophic fire during the 2014
 26 19 calendar year.
       LSB 1212HV (3) 86
       mm/sc
 20 23 shall not exceed $1 million or $500,000, depending on whether
 20 24 the eligible business has been operating in Iowa at the time of
 20 25 application for five or fewer years, or more than five years,
 20 26 respectively.  An eligible business shall not receive more than
 20 27 five tax credits under the program.  The EDA is required to
 20 28 issue tax credits on a first=come, first=served basis until the
 20 29 maximum amount of $15 million per fiscal year is reached.  If
 20 30 the amount of tax credits exceeds this amount in a fiscal year,
 20 31 the EDA is required to establish a wait list and give priority
 20 32 in subsequent years to the eligible businesses on the wait
 20 33 list.
 20 34    The division provides for the confidentiality of certain
 20 35 information under the program.  The identity of a tax credit
 21  1 recipient and the amount of the tax credit shall be considered
 21  2 public information under Code chapter 22 (examination of public
 21  3 records), but any other information or record in the possession
 21  4 of the EDA with respect to the program shall be presumed by
 21  5 the EDA to be a trade secret protected under Code chapter 550
 21  6 or common law and shall be kept confidential by the EDA unless
 21  7 otherwise ordered by a court.
 21  8    The division takes effect upon enactment and applies to
 21  9 renewable chemicals produced in Iowa from biomass feedstock on
 21 10 or after that date.  The division applies retroactively to tax
 21 11 years beginning on or after January 1, 2015.
 21 12    DIVISION II ==== ANGEL INVESTOR TAX CREDITS.   Division II
 21 13 makes several changes to the tax credit for investments in
 21 14 qualifying businesses and community=based seed capital funds,
 21 15 often referred to as the angel investor tax credits.  The
 21 16 division amends the purpose of the tax credit in Code section
 21 17 15E.41.  The division excludes investments in community=based
 21 18 seed capital funds from qualifying for the tax credit and
 21 19 makes several conforming amendments to remove references to
 21 20 community=based seed capital funds from the Code.
 21 21    The division modifies the amount and dollar limitation of
 21 22 the tax credit for a taxpayer.  The tax credit is increased
 21 23 from 20 percent to 25 percent of a taxpayer's equity investment
 21 24 in a qualifying business.  Under current law, a taxpayer cannot
 21 25 claim more than $50,000 of tax credit per investment in a
 21 26 qualifying business, and for each tax year a taxpayer and the
 21 27 taxpayer's affiliates cannot claim tax credits for more than
 21 28 five investments in five different qualifying businesses.  The
 21 29 division amends this dollar limitation to prohibit a natural
 21 30 person and the person's spouse, child, or sibling from claiming
 21 31 a combined amount of more than $100,000 in tax credits per tax
 21 32 year.
 21 33    The division also provides that no more than $500,000 in tax
 21 34 credits may be issued per tax year for equity investments in
 21 35 any one qualifying business.
 22  1 The division modifies the procedures for claiming the tax
 22  2 credit.  Under current law, the tax credit is not refundable
 22  3 but available for carryforward for up to five tax years.  The
 22  4 division makes the tax credit refundable for an investment
 22  5 made by a natural person, and for any other person reduces the
 22  6 carryforward period to three years.
 22  7    The division strikes a provision permitting the EDA
 22  8 to cooperate with small business development centers to
 22  9 disseminate information regarding the credits and to develop
 22 10 standard application forms, and requiring the EDA to distribute
 22 11 copies of the application forms to all community=based seed
 22 12 capital funds and potential individual investors.
 22 13    The division modifies the eligibility requirements for
 22 14 qualifying businesses.  The division strikes the requirement
 22 15 that a business have an owner that meets at least one of
 22 16 four qualifications relating to business education or
 22 17 business experience.  The division requires that a business
 22 18 be participating in an entrepreneurial assistance program,
 22 19 as defined in the division, but allows the EDA to waive this
 22 20 requirement if the business establishes that its owners,
 22 21 directors, officers, and employees have an appropriate level
 22 22 of experience such that an entrepreneurial assistance program
 22 23 would not materially change the prospects of the business.
 22 24 The EDA is allowed to consult with outside service providers
 22 25 in considering such a waiver.  The division increases from $5
 22 26 million to $10 million the maximum amount of net worth that
 22 27 a business may have to be considered a qualifying business.
 22 28 The division increases from $250,000 to $500,000 the amount of
 22 29 financing that a business must have in order to be considered a
 22 30 qualifying business, removes "near equity" from the types of
 22 31 financing that will be considered in that calculation, requires
 22 32 that the financing be secured at the time of application for
 22 33 the tax credits, and requires that the business have at least
 22 34 two investors at the time of application for the tax credits.
 22 35 These modified eligibility requirements apply to businesses
 23  1 that submit an application to the EDA to be registered as a
 23  2 qualifying business on or after the effective date of this
 23  3 division of the bill, and businesses that submitted such an
 23  4 application to the EDA before the effective date of this
 23  5 division of the bill shall be governed by current law.
 23  6    The division provides for the confidentiality of certain
 23  7 information with regard to the tax credit.  The identity of
 23  8 a qualifying business, the identity of an investor and the
 23  9 qualifying business in which the investor made an equity
 23 10 investment, and the total number and amount of tax credits
 23 11 issued shall be considered public information under Code
 23 12 chapter 22 (examination of public records), but any other
 23 13 information or record in the possession of the EDA with respect
 23 14 to the program shall be presumed by the EDA to be a trade secret
 23 15 protected under Code chapter 550 or common law and shall be
 23 16 kept confidential by the EDA unless otherwise ordered by a
 23 17 court.
 23 18    The division takes effect upon enactment and applies to
 23 19 equity investments in a qualifying business made on or after
 23 20 that date.  Equity investments in a qualifying business or
 23 21 community=based seed capital fund made prior to the effective
 23 22 date of the division shall be governed by current law.
 23 23    DIVISION III ==== ENTREPRENEUR INVESTMENT AWARDS PROGRAM.
 23 24  Division III amends the entrepreneur investment awards program
 23 25 administered by the EDA.  The division strikes provisions that
 23 26 prohibited the EDA from making awards under the program since
 23 27 July 1, 2014, and that required the EDA by December 31, 2014,
 23 28 to conduct a comprehensive review of the program and submit
 23 29 a report with specified information to the governor and the
 23 30 general assembly.
 23 31    The division modifies the purpose of the program to be
 23 32 to provide financial assistance to eligible entrepreneurial
 23 33 assistance providers (provider) that provide technical and
 23 34 financial assistance to entrepreneurs and start=up companies
 23 35 seeking to create, locate, or expand a business in Iowa.
 24  1 "Financial assistance" is defined in the division.
 24  2    The division changes the requirements for receiving an
 24  3 award.  To be eligible to receive an award under current
 24  4 law, an entrepreneurial assistance program must have been
 24  5 an Iowa=based business, expended at least $500,000 during
 24  6 the previous fiscal year to provide technical and financial
 24  7 assistance services that meet the broad=based needs of
 24  8 entrepreneurs seeking to create, locate, or expand a business
 24  9 in Iowa that intends to derive more than 10 percent of its
 24 10 gross sales from markets outside Iowa; and must have engaged
 24 11 and communicated with certain other programs, funding sources,
 24 12 and entities for its entrepreneur clients.  The division
 24 13 amends the eligibility for receiving financial assistance to
 24 14 require that a provider have its principal place of operations
 24 15 in Iowa and that the provider offer a comprehensive set of
 24 16 business development services to emerging and early=stage
 24 17 innovation companies to assist in the creation, location,
 24 18 growth, and long=term success of the company in Iowa.
 24 19 "Business development services" is defined in the division.
 24 20 Business development services may be performed at the physical
 24 21 location of the provider or the company and may be provided in
 24 22 consideration of equity participation in the company, a fee for
 24 23 services, or a membership agreement with the company.
 24 24    Under current law, the EDA board could approve, deny, or
 24 25 defer each application for a grant, and was required to award
 24 26 grants on a first=come, first=served basis.  The division
 24 27 specifies that the EDA board has the discretion to approve,
 24 28 deny, or defer each application for financial assistance and
 24 29 that the amount of financial assistance awarded to a provider
 24 30 is within the discretion of the EDA.  The division requires
 24 31 the EDA to award financial assistance on a competitive basis
 24 32 and allows the EDA to develop scoring criteria and establish
 24 33 minimum requirements for the receipt of a financial assistance
 24 34 award.
 24 35    In addition to the four factors relating to the provider's
 25  1 professional staff that the EDA may consider under current
 25  2 law in deciding whether to award financial assistance, the
 25  3 division provides that the EDA may also consider the service
 25  4 model and likelihood of success of the provider, the provider's
 25  5 similarity to other successful providers in the country, and
 25  6 the provider's financial need.
 25  7    The division modifies the maximum award amount for a
 25  8 recipient.  Under current law, a grant to an entrepreneur
 25  9 assistance program cannot exceed the lesser of 25 percent of
 25 10 the funds expended by the program during the previous fiscal
 25 11 year, 100 percent of the funds raised from certain persons
 25 12 by the program during the previous fiscal year, or $200,000.
 25 13 The division provides that the amount of financial assistance
 25 14 awarded to any one provider shall not exceed $200,000.
 25 15    The division modifies the permitted use of funds received
 25 16 under the program.  Under current law, grants are only
 25 17 permitted to be used for the purpose of operating costs
 25 18 incurred by the program.  The division specifies that financial
 25 19 assistance awarded to a provider shall only be used for
 25 20 the purpose of operating costs incurred by the provider in
 25 21 the provision of business development services to emerging
 25 22 and early=stage innovation companies in Iowa.  The division
 25 23 further requires that such financial assistance shall not be
 25 24 distributed to owners or investors of the company to which the
 25 25 business development services are being provided and shall not
 25 26 be provided to other persons assisting with the provision of
 25 27 the services.
 25 28    Under current law, an entrepreneurial assistance provider is
 25 29 required to accept client referrals from the EDA as a condition
 25 30 of receiving a grant.  The division provides that the EDA may
 25 31 make client referrals to eligible providers.
 25 32    DIVISION IV ==== MISCELLANEOUS CHANGES.  Division IV makes
 25 33 several miscellaneous changes to other EDA programs.  The
 25 34 division amends the sales and use tax refund available under
 25 35 the workforce housing tax incentive program.  That refund
 26  1 is available for sales and use tax paid prior to project
 26  2 completion, which is currently defined to mean the first date
 26  3 upon which the average annualized production of finished
 26  4 product for the preceding 90=day period at the manufacturing
 26  5 facility operated by the eligible business is at least 50
 26  6 percent of the initial design capacity of the facility.  The
 26  7 division amends the definition of "project completion" to mean
 26  8 the date on which the EDA notifies the department of revenue
 26  9 that all applicable requirements of a workforce housing tax
 26 10 incentive program agreement are satisfied.  This provision
 26 11 takes effect upon enactment and applies retroactively to July
 26 12 1, 2014, for all workforce housing tax incentive agreements
 26 13 entered into on or after that date.
 26 14    The division allows the EDA to extend the project
 26 15 completion date for a project awarded tax incentives under the
 26 16 redevelopment tax credit program and the housing enterprise
 26 17 zone tax incentives program if the property that is the subject
 26 18 of the project suffered a catastrophic fire during the 2014
 26 19 calendar year.

       mm/sc
 20 24 the eligible business has been operating in Iowa at the time of
 20 25 application for five or fewer years, or more than five years,
 20 26 respectively.  An eligible business shall not receive more than
 20 27 five tax credits under the program.  The EDA is required to
 20 28 issue tax credits on a first=come, first=served basis until the
 20 29 maximum amount of $15 million per fiscal year is reached.  If
 20 30 the amount of tax credits exceeds this amount in a fiscal year,
 20 31 the EDA is required to establish a wait list and give priority
 20 32 in subsequent years to the eligible businesses on the wait
 20 33 list.
 20 34    The division provides for the confidentiality of certain
 20 35 information under the program.  The identity of a tax credit
 21  1 recipient and the amount of the tax credit shall be considered
 21  2 public information under Code chapter 22 (examination of public
 21  3 records), but any other information or record in the possession
 21  4 of the EDA with respect to the program shall be presumed by
 21  5 the EDA to be a trade secret protected under Code chapter 550
 21  6 or common law and shall be kept confidential by the EDA unless
 21  7 otherwise ordered by a court.
 21  8    The division takes effect upon enactment and applies to
 21  9 renewable chemicals produced in Iowa from biomass feedstock on
 21 10 or after that date.  The division applies retroactively to tax
 21 11 years beginning on or after January 1, 2015.
 21 12    DIVISION II ==== ANGEL INVESTOR TAX CREDITS.   Division II
 21 13 makes several changes to the tax credit for investments in
 21 14 qualifying businesses and community=based seed capital funds,
 21 15 often referred to as the angel investor tax credits.  The
 21 16 division amends the purpose of the tax credit in Code section
 21 17 15E.41.  The division excludes investments in community=based
 21 18 seed capital funds from qualifying for the tax credit and
 21 19 makes several conforming amendments to remove references to
 21 20 community=based seed capital funds from the Code.
 21 21    The division modifies the amount and dollar limitation of
 21 22 the tax credit for a taxpayer.  The tax credit is increased
 21 23 from 20 percent to 25 percent of a taxpayer's equity investment
 21 24 in a qualifying business.  Under current law, a taxpayer cannot
 21 25 claim more than $50,000 of tax credit per investment in a
 21 26 qualifying business, and for each tax year a taxpayer and the
 21 27 taxpayer's affiliates cannot claim tax credits for more than
 21 28 five investments in five different qualifying businesses.  The
 21 29 division amends this dollar limitation to prohibit a natural
 21 30 person and the person's spouse, child, or sibling from claiming
 21 31 a combined amount of more than $100,000 in tax credits per tax
 21 32 year.
 21 33    The division also provides that no more than $500,000 in tax
 21 34 credits may be issued per tax year for equity investments in
 21 35 any one qualifying business.
 22  1 The division modifies the procedures for claiming the tax
 22  2 credit.  Under current law, the tax credit is not refundable
 22  3 but available for carryforward for up to five tax years.  The
 22  4 division makes the tax credit refundable for an investment
 22  5 made by a natural person, and for any other person reduces the
 22  6 carryforward period to three years.
 22  7    The division strikes a provision permitting the EDA
 22  8 to cooperate with small business development centers to
 22  9 disseminate information regarding the credits and to develop
 22 10 standard application forms, and requiring the EDA to distribute
 22 11 copies of the application forms to all community=based seed
 22 12 capital funds and potential individual investors.
 22 13    The division modifies the eligibility requirements for
 22 14 qualifying businesses.  The division strikes the requirement
 22 15 that a business have an owner that meets at least one of
 22 16 four qualifications relating to business education or
 22 17 business experience.  The division requires that a business
 22 18 be participating in an entrepreneurial assistance program,
 22 19 as defined in the division, but allows the EDA to waive this
 22 20 requirement if the business establishes that its owners,
 22 21 directors, officers, and employees have an appropriate level
 22 22 of experience such that an entrepreneurial assistance program
 22 23 would not materially change the prospects of the business.
 22 24 The EDA is allowed to consult with outside service providers
 22 25 in considering such a waiver.  The division increases from $5
 22 26 million to $10 million the maximum amount of net worth that
 22 27 a business may have to be considered a qualifying business.
 22 28 The division increases from $250,000 to $500,000 the amount of
 22 29 financing that a business must have in order to be considered a
 22 30 qualifying business, removes "near equity" from the types of
 22 31 financing that will be considered in that calculation, requires
 22 32 that the financing be secured at the time of application for
 22 33 the tax credits, and requires that the business have at least
 22 34 two investors at the time of application for the tax credits.
 22 35 These modified eligibility requirements apply to businesses
 23  1 that submit an application to the EDA to be registered as a
 23  2 qualifying business on or after the effective date of this
 23  3 division of the bill, and businesses that submitted such an
 23  4 application to the EDA before the effective date of this
 23  5 division of the bill shall be governed by current law.
 23  6    The division provides for the confidentiality of certain
 23  7 information with regard to the tax credit.  The identity of
 23  8 a qualifying business, the identity of an investor and the
 23  9 qualifying business in which the investor made an equity
 23 10 investment, and the total number and amount of tax credits
 23 11 issued shall be considered public information under Code
 23 12 chapter 22 (examination of public records), but any other
 23 13 information or record in the possession of the EDA with respect
 23 14 to the program shall be presumed by the EDA to be a trade secret
 23 15 protected under Code chapter 550 or common law and shall be
 23 16 kept confidential by the EDA unless otherwise ordered by a
 23 17 court.
 23 18    The division takes effect upon enactment and applies to
 23 19 equity investments in a qualifying business made on or after
 23 20 that date.  Equity investments in a qualifying business or
 23 21 community=based seed capital fund made prior to the effective
 23 22 date of the division shall be governed by current law.
 23 23    DIVISION III ==== ENTREPRENEUR INVESTMENT AWARDS PROGRAM.
 23 24  Division III amends the entrepreneur investment awards program
 23 25 administered by the EDA.  The division strikes provisions that
 23 26 prohibited the EDA from making awards under the program since
 23 27 July 1, 2014, and that required the EDA by December 31, 2014,
 23 28 to conduct a comprehensive review of the program and submit
 23 29 a report with specified information to the governor and the
 23 30 general assembly.
 23 31    The division modifies the purpose of the program to be
 23 32 to provide financial assistance to eligible entrepreneurial
 23 33 assistance providers (provider) that provide technical and
 23 34 financial assistance to entrepreneurs and start=up companies
 23 35 seeking to create, locate, or expand a business in Iowa.
 24  1 "Financial assistance" is defined in the division.
 24  2    The division changes the requirements for receiving an
 24  3 award.  To be eligible to receive an award under current
 24  4 law, an entrepreneurial assistance program must have been
 24  5 an Iowa=based business, expended at least $500,000 during
 24  6 the previous fiscal year to provide technical and financial
 24  7 assistance services that meet the broad=based needs of
 24  8 entrepreneurs seeking to create, locate, or expand a business
 24  9 in Iowa that intends to derive more than 10 percent of its
 24 10 gross sales from markets outside Iowa; and must have engaged
 24 11 and communicated with certain other programs, funding sources,
 24 12 and entities for its entrepreneur clients.  The division
 24 13 amends the eligibility for receiving financial assistance to
 24 14 require that a provider have its principal place of operations
 24 15 in Iowa and that the provider offer a comprehensive set of
 24 16 business development services to emerging and early=stage
 24 17 innovation companies to assist in the creation, location,
 24 18 growth, and long=term success of the company in Iowa.
 24 19 "Business development services" is defined in the division.
 24 20 Business development services may be performed at the physical
 24 21 location of the provider or the company and may be provided in
 24 22 consideration of equity participation in the company, a fee for
 24 23 services, or a membership agreement with the company.
 24 24    Under current law, the EDA board could approve, deny, or
 24 25 defer each application for a grant, and was required to award
 24 26 grants on a first=come, first=served basis.  The division
 24 27 specifies that the EDA board has the discretion to approve,
 24 28 deny, or defer each application for financial assistance and
 24 29 that the amount of financial assistance awarded to a provider
 24 30 is within the discretion of the EDA.  The division requires
 24 31 the EDA to award financial assistance on a competitive basis
 24 32 and allows the EDA to develop scoring criteria and establish
 24 33 minimum requirements for the receipt of a financial assistance
 24 34 award.
 24 35    In addition to the four factors relating to the provider's
 25  1 professional staff that the EDA may consider under current
 25  2 law in deciding whether to award financial assistance, the
 25  3 division provides that the EDA may also consider the service
 25  4 model and likelihood of success of the provider, the provider's
 25  5 similarity to other successful providers in the country, and
 25  6 the provider's financial need.
 25  7    The division modifies the maximum award amount for a
 25  8 recipient.  Under current law, a grant to an entrepreneur
 25  9 assistance program cannot exceed the lesser of 25 percent of
 25 10 the funds expended by the program during the previous fiscal
 25 11 year, 100 percent of the funds raised from certain persons
 25 12 by the program during the previous fiscal year, or $200,000.
 25 13 The division provides that the amount of financial assistance
 25 14 awarded to any one provider shall not exceed $200,000.
 25 15    The division modifies the permitted use of funds received
 25 16 under the program.  Under current law, grants are only
 25 17 permitted to be used for the purpose of operating costs
 25 18 incurred by the program.  The division specifies that financial
 25 19 assistance awarded to a provider shall only be used for
 25 20 the purpose of operating costs incurred by the provider in
 25 21 the provision of business development services to emerging
 25 22 and early=stage innovation companies in Iowa.  The division
 25 23 further requires that such financial assistance shall not be
 25 24 distributed to owners or investors of the company to which the
 25 25 business development services are being provided and shall not
 25 26 be provided to other persons assisting with the provision of
 25 27 the services.
 25 28    Under current law, an entrepreneurial assistance provider is
 25 29 required to accept client referrals from the EDA as a condition
 25 30 of receiving a grant.  The division provides that the EDA may
 25 31 make client referrals to eligible providers.
 25 32    DIVISION IV ==== MISCELLANEOUS CHANGES.  Division IV makes
 25 33 several miscellaneous changes to other EDA programs.  The
 25 34 division amends the sales and use tax refund available under
 25 35 the workforce housing tax incentive program.  That refund
 26  1 is available for sales and use tax paid prior to project
 26  2 completion, which is currently defined to mean the first date
 26  3 upon which the average annualized production of finished
 26  4 product for the preceding 90=day period at the manufacturing
 26  5 facility operated by the eligible business is at least 50
 26  6 percent of the initial design capacity of the facility.  The
 26  7 division amends the definition of "project completion" to mean
 26  8 the date on which the EDA notifies the department of revenue
 26  9 that all applicable requirements of a workforce housing tax
 26 10 incentive program agreement are satisfied.  This provision
 26 11 takes effect upon enactment and applies retroactively to July
 26 12 1, 2014, for all workforce housing tax incentive agreements
 26 13 entered into on or after that date.
 26 14    The division allows the EDA to extend the project
 26 15 completion date for a project awarded tax incentives under the
 26 16 redevelopment tax credit program and the housing enterprise
 26 17 zone tax incentives program if the property that is the subject
 26 18 of the project suffered a catastrophic fire during the 2014
 26 19 calendar year.
       LSB 1212HV (3) 86
       mm/sc
 20 25 application for five or fewer years, or more than five years,
 20 26 respectively.  An eligible business shall not receive more than
 20 27 five tax credits under the program.  The EDA is required to
 20 28 issue tax credits on a first=come, first=served basis until the
 20 29 maximum amount of $15 million per fiscal year is reached.  If
 20 30 the amount of tax credits exceeds this amount in a fiscal year,
 20 31 the EDA is required to establish a wait list and give priority
 20 32 in subsequent years to the eligible businesses on the wait
 20 33 list.
 20 34    The division provides for the confidentiality of certain
 20 35 information under the program.  The identity of a tax credit
 21  1 recipient and the amount of the tax credit shall be considered
 21  2 public information under Code chapter 22 (examination of public
 21  3 records), but any other information or record in the possession
 21  4 of the EDA with respect to the program shall be presumed by
 21  5 the EDA to be a trade secret protected under Code chapter 550
 21  6 or common law and shall be kept confidential by the EDA unless
 21  7 otherwise ordered by a court.
 21  8    The division takes effect upon enactment and applies to
 21  9 renewable chemicals produced in Iowa from biomass feedstock on
 21 10 or after that date.  The division applies retroactively to tax
 21 11 years beginning on or after January 1, 2015.
 21 12    DIVISION II ==== ANGEL INVESTOR TAX CREDITS.   Division II
 21 13 makes several changes to the tax credit for investments in
 21 14 qualifying businesses and community=based seed capital funds,
 21 15 often referred to as the angel investor tax credits.  The
 21 16 division amends the purpose of the tax credit in Code section
 21 17 15E.41.  The division excludes investments in community=based
 21 18 seed capital funds from qualifying for the tax credit and
 21 19 makes several conforming amendments to remove references to
 21 20 community=based seed capital funds from the Code.
 21 21    The division modifies the amount and dollar limitation of
 21 22 the tax credit for a taxpayer.  The tax credit is increased
 21 23 from 20 percent to 25 percent of a taxpayer's equity investment
 21 24 in a qualifying business.  Under current law, a taxpayer cannot
 21 25 claim more than $50,000 of tax credit per investment in a
 21 26 qualifying business, and for each tax year a taxpayer and the
 21 27 taxpayer's affiliates cannot claim tax credits for more than
 21 28 five investments in five different qualifying businesses.  The
 21 29 division amends this dollar limitation to prohibit a natural
 21 30 person and the person's spouse, child, or sibling from claiming
 21 31 a combined amount of more than $100,000 in tax credits per tax
 21 32 year.
 21 33    The division also provides that no more than $500,000 in tax
 21 34 credits may be issued per tax year for equity investments in
 21 35 any one qualifying business.
 22  1 The division modifies the procedures for claiming the tax
 22  2 credit.  Under current law, the tax credit is not refundable
 22  3 but available for carryforward for up to five tax years.  The
 22  4 division makes the tax credit refundable for an investment
 22  5 made by a natural person, and for any other person reduces the
 22  6 carryforward period to three years.
 22  7    The division strikes a provision permitting the EDA
 22  8 to cooperate with small business development centers to
 22  9 disseminate information regarding the credits and to develop
 22 10 standard application forms, and requiring the EDA to distribute
 22 11 copies of the application forms to all community=based seed
 22 12 capital funds and potential individual investors.
 22 13    The division modifies the eligibility requirements for
 22 14 qualifying businesses.  The division strikes the requirement
 22 15 that a business have an owner that meets at least one of
 22 16 four qualifications relating to business education or
 22 17 business experience.  The division requires that a business
 22 18 be participating in an entrepreneurial assistance program,
 22 19 as defined in the division, but allows the EDA to waive this
 22 20 requirement if the business establishes that its owners,
 22 21 directors, officers, and employees have an appropriate level
 22 22 of experience such that an entrepreneurial assistance program
 22 23 would not materially change the prospects of the business.
 22 24 The EDA is allowed to consult with outside service providers
 22 25 in considering such a waiver.  The division increases from $5
 22 26 million to $10 million the maximum amount of net worth that
 22 27 a business may have to be considered a qualifying business.
 22 28 The division increases from $250,000 to $500,000 the amount of
 22 29 financing that a business must have in order to be considered a
 22 30 qualifying business, removes "near equity" from the types of
 22 31 financing that will be considered in that calculation, requires
 22 32 that the financing be secured at the time of application for
 22 33 the tax credits, and requires that the business have at least
 22 34 two investors at the time of application for the tax credits.
 22 35 These modified eligibility requirements apply to businesses
 23  1 that submit an application to the EDA to be registered as a
 23  2 qualifying business on or after the effective date of this
 23  3 division of the bill, and businesses that submitted such an
 23  4 application to the EDA before the effective date of this
 23  5 division of the bill shall be governed by current law.
 23  6    The division provides for the confidentiality of certain
 23  7 information with regard to the tax credit.  The identity of
 23  8 a qualifying business, the identity of an investor and the
 23  9 qualifying business in which the investor made an equity
 23 10 investment, and the total number and amount of tax credits
 23 11 issued shall be considered public information under Code
 23 12 chapter 22 (examination of public records), but any other
 23 13 information or record in the possession of the EDA with respect
 23 14 to the program shall be presumed by the EDA to be a trade secret
 23 15 protected under Code chapter 550 or common law and shall be
 23 16 kept confidential by the EDA unless otherwise ordered by a
 23 17 court.
 23 18    The division takes effect upon enactment and applies to
 23 19 equity investments in a qualifying business made on or after
 23 20 that date.  Equity investments in a qualifying business or
 23 21 community=based seed capital fund made prior to the effective
 23 22 date of the division shall be governed by current law.
 23 23    DIVISION III ==== ENTREPRENEUR INVESTMENT AWARDS PROGRAM.
 23 24  Division III amends the entrepreneur investment awards program
 23 25 administered by the EDA.  The division strikes provisions that
 23 26 prohibited the EDA from making awards under the program since
 23 27 July 1, 2014, and that required the EDA by December 31, 2014,
 23 28 to conduct a comprehensive review of the program and submit
 23 29 a report with specified information to the governor and the
 23 30 general assembly.
 23 31    The division modifies the purpose of the program to be
 23 32 to provide financial assistance to eligible entrepreneurial
 23 33 assistance providers (provider) that provide technical and
 23 34 financial assistance to entrepreneurs and start=up companies
 23 35 seeking to create, locate, or expand a business in Iowa.
 24  1 "Financial assistance" is defined in the division.
 24  2    The division changes the requirements for receiving an

 24  4 law, an entrepreneurial assistance program must have been
 24  5 an Iowa=based business, expended at least $500,000 during

 24 13 amends the eligibility for receiving financial assistance to
 24 14 require that a provider have its principal place of operations
 24 15 in Iowa and that the provider offer a comprehensive set of
 24 16 business development services to emerging and early=stage
 24 17 innovation companies to assist in the creation, location,
 24 18 growth, and long=term success of the company in Iowa.
 24 19 "Business development services" is defined in the division.
 24 20 Business development services may be performed at the physical
 24 21 location of the provider or the company and may be provided in
 24 22 consideration of equity participation in the company, a fee for
 24 23 services, or a membership agreement with the company.
 24 24    Under current law, the EDA board could approve, deny, or
 24 25 defer each application for a grant, and was required to award
 24 26 grants on a first=come, first=served basis.  The division
 24 27 specifies that the EDA board has the discretion to approve,
 24 28 deny, or defer each application for financial assistance and
 24 29 that the amount of financial assistance awarded to a provider
 24 30 is within the discretion of the EDA.  The division requires
 24 31 the EDA to award financial assistance on a competitive basis
 24 32 and allows the EDA to develop scoring criteria and establish

 25  3 division provides that the EDA may also consider the service
 25  4 model and likelihood of success of the provider, the provider's
 25  5 similarity to other successful providers in the country, and
 25  6 the provider's financial need.
 25  7    The division modifies the maximum award amount for a
 25  8 recipient.  Under current law, a grant to an entrepreneur
 25  9 assistance program cannot exceed the lesser of 25 percent of
 25 10 the funds expended by the program during the previous fiscal
 25 11 year, 100 percent of the funds raised from certain persons
 25 12 by the program during the previous fiscal year, or $200,000.
 25 13 The division provides that the amount of financial assistance
 25 14 awarded to any one provider shall not exceed $200,000.
 25 15    The division modifies the permitted use of funds received
 25 16 under the program.  Under current law, grants are only
 25 17 permitted to be used for the purpose of operating costs
 25 18 incurred by the program.  The division specifies that financial
 25 19 assistance awarded to a provider shall only be used for
 25 20 the purpose of operating costs incurred by the provider in
 25 21 the provision of business development services to emerging
 25 22 and early=stage innovation companies in Iowa.  The division
 25 23 further requires that such financial assistance shall not be
 25 24 distributed to owners or investors of the company to which the
 25 25 business development services are being provided and shall not
 25 26 be provided to other persons assisting with the provision of
 25 27 the services.
 25 28    Under current law, an entrepreneurial assistance provider is
 25 29 required to accept client referrals from the EDA as a condition
 25 30 of receiving a grant.  The division provides that the EDA may
 25 31 make client referrals to eligible providers.
 25 32    DIVISION IV ==== MISCELLANEOUS CHANGES.  Division IV makes
 25 33 several miscellaneous changes to other EDA programs.  The
 25 34 division amends the sales and use tax refund available under

 26  5 facility operated by the eligible business is at least 50
 26  6 percent of the initial design capacity of the facility.  The
 26  7 division amends the definition of "project completion" to mean
 26  8 the date on which the EDA notifies the department of revenue
 26  9 that all applicable requirements of a workforce housing tax
 26 10 incentive program agreement are satisfied.  This provision
 26 11 takes effect upon enactment and applies retroactively to July

 21 15 often referred to as the angel investor tax credits.  The
 21 16 division amends the purpose of the tax credit in Code section
 21 17 15E.41.  The division excludes investments in community=based
 21 18 seed capital funds from qualifying for the tax credit and
 21 19 makes several conforming amendments to remove references to
 21 20 community=based seed capital funds from the Code.
 21 21    The division modifies the amount and dollar limitation of
 21 22 the tax credit for a taxpayer.  The tax credit is increased
 21 23 from 20 percent to 25 percent of a taxpayer's equity investment
 21 24 in a qualifying business.  Under current law, a taxpayer cannot
 21 25 claim more than $50,000 of tax credit per investment in a
 21 26 qualifying business, and for each tax year a taxpayer and the
 21 27 taxpayer's affiliates cannot claim tax credits for more than
 21 28 five investments in five different qualifying businesses.  The
 21 29 division amends this dollar limitation to prohibit a natural
 21 30 person and the person's spouse, child, or sibling from claiming
 21 31 a combined amount of more than $100,000 in tax credits per tax
 21 32 year.
 21 33    The division also provides that no more than $500,000 in tax
 21 34 credits may be issued per tax year for equity investments in
 21 35 any one qualifying business.
 22  1 The division modifies the procedures for claiming the tax
 22  2 credit.  Under current law, the tax credit is not refundable
 22  3 but available for carryforward for up to five tax years.  The
 22  4 division makes the tax credit refundable for an investment
 22  5 made by a natural person, and for any other person reduces the
 22  6 carryforward period to three years.
 22  7    The division strikes a provision permitting the EDA
 22  8 to cooperate with small business development centers to
 22  9 disseminate information regarding the credits and to develop
 22 10 standard application forms, and requiring the EDA to distribute
 22 11 copies of the application forms to all community=based seed
 22 12 capital funds and potential individual investors.
 22 13    The division modifies the eligibility requirements for
 22 14 qualifying businesses.  The division strikes the requirement
 22 15 that a business have an owner that meets at least one of
 22 16 four qualifications relating to business education or
 22 17 business experience.  The division requires that a business
 22 18 be participating in an entrepreneurial assistance program,
 22 19 as defined in the division, but allows the EDA to waive this
 22 20 requirement if the business establishes that its owners,
 22 21 directors, officers, and employees have an appropriate level
 22 22 of experience such that an entrepreneurial assistance program
 22 23 would not materially change the prospects of the business.
 22 24 The EDA is allowed to consult with outside service providers
 22 25 in considering such a waiver.  The division increases from $5
 22 26 million to $10 million the maximum amount of net worth that
 22 27 a business may have to be considered a qualifying business.
 22 28 The division increases from $250,000 to $500,000 the amount of
 22 29 financing that a business must have in order to be considered a
 22 30 qualifying business, removes "near equity" from the types of
 22 31 financing that will be considered in that calculation, requires
 22 32 that the financing be secured at the time of application for
 22 33 the tax credits, and requires that the business have at least
 22 34 two investors at the time of application for the tax credits.
 22 35 These modified eligibility requirements apply to businesses
 23  1 that submit an application to the EDA to be registered as a
 23  2 qualifying business on or after the effective date of this
 23  3 division of the bill, and businesses that submitted such an
 23  4 application to the EDA before the effective date of this
 23  5 division of the bill shall be governed by current law.
 23  6    The division provides for the confidentiality of certain
 23  7 information with regard to the tax credit.  The identity of
 23  8 a qualifying business, the identity of an investor and the
 23  9 qualifying business in which the investor made an equity
 23 10 investment, and the total number and amount of tax credits
 23 11 issued shall be considered public information under Code
 23 12 chapter 22 (examination of public records), but any other
 23 13 information or record in the possession of the EDA with respect
 23 14 to the program shall be presumed by the EDA to be a trade secret
 23 15 protected under Code chapter 550 or common law and shall be
 23 16 kept confidential by the EDA unless otherwise ordered by a
 23 17 court.
 23 18    The division takes effect upon enactment and applies to
 23 19 equity investments in a qualifying business made on or after
 23 20 that date.  Equity investments in a qualifying business or
 23 21 community=based seed capital fund made prior to the effective
 23 22 date of the division shall be governed by current law.
 23 23    DIVISION III ==== ENTREPRENEUR INVESTMENT AWARDS PROGRAM.
 23 24  Division III amends the entrepreneur investment awards program
 23 25 administered by the EDA.  The division strikes provisions that
 23 26 prohibited the EDA from making awards under the program since
 23 27 July 1, 2014, and that required the EDA by December 31, 2014,
 23 28 to conduct a comprehensive review of the program and submit
 23 29 a report with specified information to the governor and the
 23 30 general assembly.
 23 31    The division modifies the purpose of the program to be
 23 32 to provide financial assistance to eligible entrepreneurial
 23 33 assistance providers (provider) that provide technical and
 23 34 financial assistance to entrepreneurs and start=up companies
 23 35 seeking to create, locate, or expand a business in Iowa.
 24  1 "Financial assistance" is defined in the division.
 24  2    The division changes the requirements for receiving an
 24  3 award.  To be eligible to receive an award under current
 24  4 law, an entrepreneurial assistance program must have been
 24  5 an Iowa=based business, expended at least $500,000 during
 24  6 the previous fiscal year to provide technical and financial
 24  7 assistance services that meet the broad=based needs of
 24  8 entrepreneurs seeking to create, locate, or expand a business
 24  9 in Iowa that intends to derive more than 10 percent of its
 24 10 gross sales from markets outside Iowa; and must have engaged
 24 11 and communicated with certain other programs, funding sources,
 24 12 and entities for its entrepreneur clients.  The division
 24 13 amends the eligibility for receiving financial assistance to
 24 14 require that a provider have its principal place of operations
 24 15 in Iowa and that the provider offer a comprehensive set of
 24 16 business development services to emerging and early=stage
 24 17 innovation companies to assist in the creation, location,
 24 18 growth, and long=term success of the company in Iowa.
 24 19 "Business development services" is defined in the division.
 24 20 Business development services may be performed at the physical
 24 21 location of the provider or the company and may be provided in
 24 22 consideration of equity participation in the company, a fee for
 24 23 services, or a membership agreement with the company.
 24 24    Under current law, the EDA board could approve, deny, or
 24 25 defer each application for a grant, and was required to award
 24 26 grants on a first=come, first=served basis.  The division
 24 27 specifies that the EDA board has the discretion to approve,
 24 28 deny, or defer each application for financial assistance and
 24 29 that the amount of financial assistance awarded to a provider
 24 30 is within the discretion of the EDA.  The division requires
 24 31 the EDA to award financial assistance on a competitive basis
 24 32 and allows the EDA to develop scoring criteria and establish
 24 33 minimum requirements for the receipt of a financial assistance
 24 34 award.
 24 35    In addition to the four factors relating to the provider's
 25  1 professional staff that the EDA may consider under current
 25  2 law in deciding whether to award financial assistance, the
 25  3 division provides that the EDA may also consider the service
 25  4 model and likelihood of success of the provider, the provider's
 25  5 similarity to other successful providers in the country, and
 25  6 the provider's financial need.
 25  7    The division modifies the maximum award amount for a
 25  8 recipient.  Under current law, a grant to an entrepreneur
 25  9 assistance program cannot exceed the lesser of 25 percent of
 25 10 the funds expended by the program during the previous fiscal
 25 11 year, 100 percent of the funds raised from certain persons
 25 12 by the program during the previous fiscal year, or $200,000.
 25 13 The division provides that the amount of financial assistance
 25 14 awarded to any one provider shall not exceed $200,000.
 25 15    The division modifies the permitted use of funds received
 25 16 under the program.  Under current law, grants are only
 25 17 permitted to be used for the purpose of operating costs
 25 18 incurred by the program.  The division specifies that financial
 25 19 assistance awarded to a provider shall only be used for
 25 20 the purpose of operating costs incurred by the provider in
 25 21 the provision of business development services to emerging
 25 22 and early=stage innovation companies in Iowa.  The division
 25 23 further requires that such financial assistance shall not be
 25 24 distributed to owners or investors of the company to which the
 25 25 business development services are being provided and shall not
 25 26 be provided to other persons assisting with the provision of
 25 27 the services.
 25 28    Under current law, an entrepreneurial assistance provider is
 25 29 required to accept client referrals from the EDA as a condition
 25 30 of receiving a grant.  The division provides that the EDA may
 25 31 make client referrals to eligible providers.
 25 32    DIVISION IV ==== MISCELLANEOUS CHANGES.  Division IV makes
 25 33 several miscellaneous changes to other EDA programs.  The
 25 34 division amends the sales and use tax refund available under
 25 35 the workforce housing tax incentive program.  That refund
 26  1 is available for sales and use tax paid prior to project
 26  2 completion, which is currently defined to mean the first date
 26  3 upon which the average annualized production of finished
 26  4 product for the preceding 90=day period at the manufacturing
 26  5 facility operated by the eligible business is at least 50
 26  6 percent of the initial design capacity of the facility.  The
 26  7 division amends the definition of "project completion" to mean
 26  8 the date on which the EDA notifies the department of revenue
 26  9 that all applicable requirements of a workforce housing tax
 26 10 incentive program agreement are satisfied.  This provision
 26 11 takes effect upon enactment and applies retroactively to July
 26 12 1, 2014, for all workforce housing tax incentive agreements
 26 13 entered into on or after that date.
 26 14    The division allows the EDA to extend the project
 26 15 completion date for a project awarded tax incentives under the
 26 16 redevelopment tax credit program and the housing enterprise
 26 17 zone tax incentives program if the property that is the subject
 26 18 of the project suffered a catastrophic fire during the 2014
 26 19 calendar year.
       LSB 1212HV (3) 86
       mm/sc
 20 27 five tax credits under the program.  The EDA is required to
 20 28 issue tax credits on a first=come, first=served basis until the
 20 29 maximum amount of $15 million per fiscal year is reached.  If
 20 30 the amount of tax credits exceeds this amount in a fiscal year,
 20 31 the EDA is required to establish a wait list and give priority
 20 32 in subsequent years to the eligible businesses on the wait
 20 33 list.
 20 34    The division provides for the confidentiality of certain
 20 35 information under the program.  The identity of a tax credit
 21  1 recipient and the amount of the tax credit shall be considered
 21  2 public information under Code chapter 22 (examination of public
 21  3 records), but any other information or record in the possession
 21  4 of the EDA with respect to the program shall be presumed by
 21  5 the EDA to be a trade secret protected under Code chapter 550
 21  6 or common law and shall be kept confidential by the EDA unless
 21  7 otherwise ordered by a court.
 21  8    The division takes effect upon enactment and applies to
 21  9 renewable chemicals produced in Iowa from biomass feedstock on
 21 10 or after that date.  The division applies retroactively to tax
 21 11 years beginning on or after January 1, 2015.
 21 12    DIVISION II ==== ANGEL INVESTOR TAX CREDITS.   Division II
 21 13 makes several changes to the tax credit for investments in
 21 14 qualifying businesses and community=based seed capital funds,
 21 15 often referred to as the angel investor tax credits.  The
 21 16 division amends the purpose of the tax credit in Code section
 21 17 15E.41.  The division excludes investments in community=based
 21 18 seed capital funds from qualifying for the tax credit and
 21 19 makes several conforming amendments to remove references to
 21 20 community=based seed capital funds from the Code.
 21 21    The division modifies the amount and dollar limitation of
 21 22 the tax credit for a taxpayer.  The tax credit is increased
 21 23 from 20 percent to 25 percent of a taxpayer's equity investment
 21 24 in a qualifying business.  Under current law, a taxpayer cannot
 21 25 claim more than $50,000 of tax credit per investment in a
 21 26 qualifying business, and for each tax year a taxpayer and the
 21 27 taxpayer's affiliates cannot claim tax credits for more than
 21 28 five investments in five different qualifying businesses.  The
 21 29 division amends this dollar limitation to prohibit a natural
 21 30 person and the person's spouse, child, or sibling from claiming
 21 31 a combined amount of more than $100,000 in tax credits per tax
 21 32 year.
 21 33    The division also provides that no more than $500,000 in tax
 21 34 credits may be issued per tax year for equity investments in
 21 35 any one qualifying business.
 22  1 The division modifies the procedures for claiming the tax
 22  2 credit.  Under current law, the tax credit is not refundable
 22  3 but available for carryforward for up to five tax years.  The
 22  4 division makes the tax credit refundable for an investment
 22  5 made by a natural person, and for any other person reduces the
 22  6 carryforward period to three years.
 22  7    The division strikes a provision permitting the EDA
 22  8 to cooperate with small business development centers to
 22  9 disseminate information regarding the credits and to develop
 22 10 standard application forms, and requiring the EDA to distribute
 22 11 copies of the application forms to all community=based seed
 22 12 capital funds and potential individual investors.
 22 13    The division modifies the eligibility requirements for
 22 14 qualifying businesses.  The division strikes the requirement
 22 15 that a business have an owner that meets at least one of
 22 16 four qualifications relating to business education or
 22 17 business experience.  The division requires that a business
 22 18 be participating in an entrepreneurial assistance program,
 22 19 as defined in the division, but allows the EDA to waive this
 22 20 requirement if the business establishes that its owners,
 22 21 directors, officers, and employees have an appropriate level
 22 22 of experience such that an entrepreneurial assistance program
 22 23 would not materially change the prospects of the business.
 22 24 The EDA is allowed to consult with outside service providers
 22 25 in considering such a waiver.  The division increases from $5
 22 26 million to $10 million the maximum amount of net worth that
 22 27 a business may have to be considered a qualifying business.
 22 28 The division increases from $250,000 to $500,000 the amount of
 22 29 financing that a business must have in order to be considered a
 22 30 qualifying business, removes "near equity" from the types of
 22 31 financing that will be considered in that calculation, requires
 22 32 that the financing be secured at the time of application for
 22 33 the tax credits, and requires that the business have at least
 22 34 two investors at the time of application for the tax credits.
 22 35 These modified eligibility requirements apply to businesses
 23  1 that submit an application to the EDA to be registered as a
 23  2 qualifying business on or after the effective date of this
 23  3 division of the bill, and businesses that submitted such an
 23  4 application to the EDA before the effective date of this
 23  5 division of the bill shall be governed by current law.
 23  6    The division provides for the confidentiality of certain
 23  7 information with regard to the tax credit.  The identity of
 23  8 a qualifying business, the identity of an investor and the
 23  9 qualifying business in which the investor made an equity
 23 10 investment, and the total number and amount of tax credits
 23 11 issued shall be considered public information under Code
 23 12 chapter 22 (examination of public records), but any other
 23 13 information or record in the possession of the EDA with respect
 23 14 to the program shall be presumed by the EDA to be a trade secret
 23 15 protected under Code chapter 550 or common law and shall be
 23 16 kept confidential by the EDA unless otherwise ordered by a
 23 17 court.
 23 18    The division takes effect upon enactment and applies to
 23 19 equity investments in a qualifying business made on or after
 23 20 that date.  Equity investments in a qualifying business or
 23 21 community=based seed capital fund made prior to the effective
 23 22 date of the division shall be governed by current law.
 23 23    DIVISION III ==== ENTREPRENEUR INVESTMENT AWARDS PROGRAM.
 23 24  Division III amends the entrepreneur investment awards program
 23 25 administered by the EDA.  The division strikes provisions that
 23 26 prohibited the EDA from making awards under the program since
 23 27 July 1, 2014, and that required the EDA by December 31, 2014,
 23 28 to conduct a comprehensive review of the program and submit
 23 29 a report with specified information to the governor and the
 23 30 general assembly.
 23 31    The division modifies the purpose of the program to be
 23 32 to provide financial assistance to eligible entrepreneurial
 23 33 assistance providers (provider) that provide technical and
 23 34 financial assistance to entrepreneurs and start=up companies
 23 35 seeking to create, locate, or expand a business in Iowa.
 24  1 "Financial assistance" is defined in the division.
 24  2    The division changes the requirements for receiving an
 24  3 award.  To be eligible to receive an award under current
 24  4 law, an entrepreneurial assistance program must have been
 24  5 an Iowa=based business, expended at least $500,000 during
 24  6 the previous fiscal year to provide technical and financial
 24  7 assistance services that meet the broad=based needs of
 24  8 entrepreneurs seeking to create, locate, or expand a business
 24  9 in Iowa that intends to derive more than 10 percent of its
 24 10 gross sales from markets outside Iowa; and must have engaged
 24 11 and communicated with certain other programs, funding sources,
 24 12 and entities for its entrepreneur clients.  The division
 24 13 amends the eligibility for receiving financial assistance to
 24 14 require that a provider have its principal place of operations
 24 15 in Iowa and that the provider offer a comprehensive set of
 24 16 business development services to emerging and early=stage
 24 17 innovation companies to assist in the creation, location,
 24 18 growth, and long=term success of the company in Iowa.
 24 19 "Business development services" is defined in the division.
 24 20 Business development services may be performed at the physical
 24 21 location of the provider or the company and may be provided in
 24 22 consideration of equity participation in the company, a fee for
 24 23 services, or a membership agreement with the company.
 24 24    Under current law, the EDA board could approve, deny, or
 24 25 defer each application for a grant, and was required to award
 24 26 grants on a first=come, first=served basis.  The division
 24 27 specifies that the EDA board has the discretion to approve,
 24 28 deny, or defer each application for financial assistance and
 24 29 that the amount of financial assistance awarded to a provider
 24 30 is within the discretion of the EDA.  The division requires
 24 31 the EDA to award financial assistance on a competitive basis
 24 32 and allows the EDA to develop scoring criteria and establish
 24 33 minimum requirements for the receipt of a financial assistance
 24 34 award.
 24 35    In addition to the four factors relating to the provider's
 25  1 professional staff that the EDA may consider under current
 25  2 law in deciding whether to award financial assistance, the
 25  3 division provides that the EDA may also consider the service
 25  4 model and likelihood of success of the provider, the provider's
 25  5 similarity to other successful providers in the country, and
 25  6 the provider's financial need.
 25  7    The division modifies the maximum award amount for a
 25  8 recipient.  Under current law, a grant to an entrepreneur
 25  9 assistance program cannot exceed the lesser of 25 percent of
 25 10 the funds expended by the program during the previous fiscal
 25 11 year, 100 percent of the funds raised from certain persons
 25 12 by the program during the previous fiscal year, or $200,000.
 25 13 The division provides that the amount of financial assistance
 25 14 awarded to any one provider shall not exceed $200,000.
 25 15    The division modifies the permitted use of funds received
 25 16 under the program.  Under current law, grants are only
 25 17 permitted to be used for the purpose of operating costs
 25 18 incurred by the program.  The division specifies that financial
 25 19 assistance awarded to a provider shall only be used for
 25 20 the purpose of operating costs incurred by the provider in
 25 21 the provision of business development services to emerging
 25 22 and early=stage innovation companies in Iowa.  The division
 25 23 further requires that such financial assistance shall not be
 25 24 distributed to owners or investors of the company to which the
 25 25 business development services are being provided and shall not
 25 26 be provided to other persons assisting with the provision of
 25 27 the services.
 25 28    Under current law, an entrepreneurial assistance provider is
 25 29 required to accept client referrals from the EDA as a condition
 25 30 of receiving a grant.  The division provides that the EDA may
 25 31 make client referrals to eligible providers.
 25 32    DIVISION IV ==== MISCELLANEOUS CHANGES.  Division IV makes
 25 33 several miscellaneous changes to other EDA programs.  The
 25 34 division amends the sales and use tax refund available under
 25 35 the workforce housing tax incentive program.  That refund
 26  1 is available for sales and use tax paid prior to project
 26  2 completion, which is currently defined to mean the first date
 26  3 upon which the average annualized production of finished
 26  4 product for the preceding 90=day period at the manufacturing
 26  5 facility operated by the eligible business is at least 50
 26  6 percent of the initial design capacity of the facility.  The
 26  7 division amends the definition of "project completion" to mean
 26  8 the date on which the EDA notifies the department of revenue
 26  9 that all applicable requirements of a workforce housing tax
 26 10 incentive program agreement are satisfied.  This provision
 26 11 takes effect upon enactment and applies retroactively to July
 26 12 1, 2014, for all workforce housing tax incentive agreements
 26 13 entered into on or after that date.
 26 14    The division allows the EDA to extend the project
 26 15 completion date for a project awarded tax incentives under the
 26 16 redevelopment tax credit program and the housing enterprise
 26 17 zone tax incentives program if the property that is the subject

 20 34    The division provides for the confidentiality of certain

 21  1 recipient and the amount of the tax credit shall be considered
 21  2 public information under Code chapter 22 (examination of public

 21  4 of the EDA with respect to the program shall be presumed by
 21  5 the EDA to be a trade secret protected under Code chapter 550
 21  6 or common law and shall be kept confidential by the EDA unless
 21  7 otherwise ordered by a court.

 21 11 years beginning on or after January 1, 2015.
 21 12    DIVISION II ==== ANGEL INVESTOR TAX CREDITS.   Division II
 21 13 makes several changes to the tax credit for investments in
 21 14 qualifying businesses and community=based seed capital funds,
 21 15 often referred to as the angel investor tax credits.  The
 21 16 division amends the purpose of the tax credit in Code section
 21 17 15E.41.  The division excludes investments in community=based
 21 18 seed capital funds from qualifying for the tax credit and
 21 19 makes several conforming amendments to remove references to
 21 20 community=based seed capital funds from the Code.
 21 21    The division modifies the amount and dollar limitation of
 21 22 the tax credit for a taxpayer.  The tax credit is increased
 21 23 from 20 percent to 25 percent of a taxpayer's equity investment
 21 24 in a qualifying business.  Under current law, a taxpayer cannot
 21 25 claim more than $50,000 of tax credit per investment in a
 21 26 qualifying business, and for each tax year a taxpayer and the
 21 27 taxpayer's affiliates cannot claim tax credits for more than
 21 28 five investments in five different qualifying businesses.  The
 21 29 division amends this dollar limitation to prohibit a natural
 21 30 person and the person's spouse, child, or sibling from claiming
 21 31 a combined amount of more than $100,000 in tax credits per tax
 21 32 year.
 21 33    The division also provides that no more than $500,000 in tax
 21 34 credits may be issued per tax year for equity investments in
 21 35 any one qualifying business.
 22  1 The division modifies the procedures for claiming the tax
 22  2 credit.  Under current law, the tax credit is not refundable
 22  3 but available for carryforward for up to five tax years.  The
 22  4 division makes the tax credit refundable for an investment
 22  5 made by a natural person, and for any other person reduces the
 22  6 carryforward period to three years.
 22  7    The division strikes a provision permitting the EDA
 22  8 to cooperate with small business development centers to
 22  9 disseminate information regarding the credits and to develop
 22 10 standard application forms, and requiring the EDA to distribute
 22 11 copies of the application forms to all community=based seed
 22 12 capital funds and potential individual investors.
 22 13    The division modifies the eligibility requirements for
 22 14 qualifying businesses.  The division strikes the requirement
 22 15 that a business have an owner that meets at least one of
 22 16 four qualifications relating to business education or
 22 17 business experience.  The division requires that a business
 22 18 be participating in an entrepreneurial assistance program,
 22 19 as defined in the division, but allows the EDA to waive this
 22 20 requirement if the business establishes that its owners,
 22 21 directors, officers, and employees have an appropriate level
 22 22 of experience such that an entrepreneurial assistance program
 22 23 would not materially change the prospects of the business.
 22 24 The EDA is allowed to consult with outside service providers
 22 25 in considering such a waiver.  The division increases from $5
 22 26 million to $10 million the maximum amount of net worth that
 22 27 a business may have to be considered a qualifying business.
 22 28 The division increases from $250,000 to $500,000 the amount of
 22 29 financing that a business must have in order to be considered a
 22 30 qualifying business, removes "near equity" from the types of
 22 31 financing that will be considered in that calculation, requires
 22 32 that the financing be secured at the time of application for
 22 33 the tax credits, and requires that the business have at least
 22 34 two investors at the time of application for the tax credits.
 22 35 These modified eligibility requirements apply to businesses
 23  1 that submit an application to the EDA to be registered as a
 23  2 qualifying business on or after the effective date of this
 23  3 division of the bill, and businesses that submitted such an
 23  4 application to the EDA before the effective date of this
 23  5 division of the bill shall be governed by current law.
 23  6    The division provides for the confidentiality of certain
 23  7 information with regard to the tax credit.  The identity of
 23  8 a qualifying business, the identity of an investor and the
 23  9 qualifying business in which the investor made an equity
 23 10 investment, and the total number and amount of tax credits
 23 11 issued shall be considered public information under Code
 23 12 chapter 22 (examination of public records), but any other
 23 13 information or record in the possession of the EDA with respect
 23 14 to the program shall be presumed by the EDA to be a trade secret
 23 15 protected under Code chapter 550 or common law and shall be
 23 16 kept confidential by the EDA unless otherwise ordered by a
 23 17 court.
 23 18    The division takes effect upon enactment and applies to
 23 19 equity investments in a qualifying business made on or after
 23 20 that date.  Equity investments in a qualifying business or
 23 21 community=based seed capital fund made prior to the effective
 23 22 date of the division shall be governed by current law.
 23 23    DIVISION III ==== ENTREPRENEUR INVESTMENT AWARDS PROGRAM.
 23 24  Division III amends the entrepreneur investment awards program
 23 25 administered by the EDA.  The division strikes provisions that
 23 26 prohibited the EDA from making awards under the program since
 23 27 July 1, 2014, and that required the EDA by December 31, 2014,
 23 28 to conduct a comprehensive review of the program and submit
 23 29 a report with specified information to the governor and the
 23 30 general assembly.
 23 31    The division modifies the purpose of the program to be
 23 32 to provide financial assistance to eligible entrepreneurial
 23 33 assistance providers (provider) that provide technical and
 23 34 financial assistance to entrepreneurs and start=up companies
 23 35 seeking to create, locate, or expand a business in Iowa.
 24  1 "Financial assistance" is defined in the division.
 24  2    The division changes the requirements for receiving an
 24  3 award.  To be eligible to receive an award under current
 24  4 law, an entrepreneurial assistance program must have been
 24  5 an Iowa=based business, expended at least $500,000 during
 24  6 the previous fiscal year to provide technical and financial
 24  7 assistance services that meet the broad=based needs of
 24  8 entrepreneurs seeking to create, locate, or expand a business
 24  9 in Iowa that intends to derive more than 10 percent of its
 24 10 gross sales from markets outside Iowa; and must have engaged
 24 11 and communicated with certain other programs, funding sources,
 24 12 and entities for its entrepreneur clients.  The division
 24 13 amends the eligibility for receiving financial assistance to
 24 14 require that a provider have its principal place of operations
 24 15 in Iowa and that the provider offer a comprehensive set of
 24 16 business development services to emerging and early=stage
 24 17 innovation companies to assist in the creation, location,
 24 18 growth, and long=term success of the company in Iowa.
 24 19 "Business development services" is defined in the division.
 24 20 Business development services may be performed at the physical
 24 21 location of the provider or the company and may be provided in
 24 22 consideration of equity participation in the company, a fee for
 24 23 services, or a membership agreement with the company.
 24 24    Under current law, the EDA board could approve, deny, or
 24 25 defer each application for a grant, and was required to award
 24 26 grants on a first=come, first=served basis.  The division
 24 27 specifies that the EDA board has the discretion to approve,
 24 28 deny, or defer each application for financial assistance and
 24 29 that the amount of financial assistance awarded to a provider
 24 30 is within the discretion of the EDA.  The division requires
 24 31 the EDA to award financial assistance on a competitive basis
 24 32 and allows the EDA to develop scoring criteria and establish
 24 33 minimum requirements for the receipt of a financial assistance
 24 34 award.
 24 35    In addition to the four factors relating to the provider's
 25  1 professional staff that the EDA may consider under current
 25  2 law in deciding whether to award financial assistance, the
 25  3 division provides that the EDA may also consider the service
 25  4 model and likelihood of success of the provider, the provider's
 25  5 similarity to other successful providers in the country, and
 25  6 the provider's financial need.
 25  7    The division modifies the maximum award amount for a
 25  8 recipient.  Under current law, a grant to an entrepreneur
 25  9 assistance program cannot exceed the lesser of 25 percent of
 25 10 the funds expended by the program during the previous fiscal
 25 11 year, 100 percent of the funds raised from certain persons
 25 12 by the program during the previous fiscal year, or $200,000.
 25 13 The division provides that the amount of financial assistance
 25 14 awarded to any one provider shall not exceed $200,000.
 25 15    The division modifies the permitted use of funds received
 25 16 under the program.  Under current law, grants are only
 25 17 permitted to be used for the purpose of operating costs
 25 18 incurred by the program.  The division specifies that financial
 25 19 assistance awarded to a provider shall only be used for
 25 20 the purpose of operating costs incurred by the provider in
 25 21 the provision of business development services to emerging
 25 22 and early=stage innovation companies in Iowa.  The division
 25 23 further requires that such financial assistance shall not be
 25 24 distributed to owners or investors of the company to which the
 25 25 business development services are being provided and shall not
 25 26 be provided to other persons assisting with the provision of
 25 27 the services.
 25 28    Under current law, an entrepreneurial assistance provider is
 25 29 required to accept client referrals from the EDA as a condition
 25 30 of receiving a grant.  The division provides that the EDA may
 25 31 make client referrals to eligible providers.
 25 32    DIVISION IV ==== MISCELLANEOUS CHANGES.  Division IV makes
 25 33 several miscellaneous changes to other EDA programs.  The
 25 34 division amends the sales and use tax refund available under
 25 35 the workforce housing tax incentive program.  That refund
 26  1 is available for sales and use tax paid prior to project
 26  2 completion, which is currently defined to mean the first date
 26  3 upon which the average annualized production of finished
 26  4 product for the preceding 90=day period at the manufacturing
 26  5 facility operated by the eligible business is at least 50
 26  6 percent of the initial design capacity of the facility.  The
 26  7 division amends the definition of "project completion" to mean
 26  8 the date on which the EDA notifies the department of revenue
 26  9 that all applicable requirements of a workforce housing tax
 26 10 incentive program agreement are satisfied.  This provision
 26 11 takes effect upon enactment and applies retroactively to July
 26 12 1, 2014, for all workforce housing tax incentive agreements
 26 13 entered into on or after that date.
 26 14    The division allows the EDA to extend the project
 26 15 completion date for a project awarded tax incentives under the
 26 16 redevelopment tax credit program and the housing enterprise
 26 17 zone tax incentives program if the property that is the subject
 26 18 of the project suffered a catastrophic fire during the 2014
 26 19 calendar year.
       LSB 1212HV (3) 86
       mm/sc
 20 29 maximum amount of $15 million per fiscal year is reached.  If
 20 30 the amount of tax credits exceeds this amount in a fiscal year,
 20 31 the EDA is required to establish a wait list and give priority
 20 32 in subsequent years to the eligible businesses on the wait
 20 33 list.
 20 34    The division provides for the confidentiality of certain
 20 35 information under the program.  The identity of a tax credit
 21  1 recipient and the amount of the tax credit shall be considered
 21  2 public information under Code chapter 22 (examination of public
 21  3 records), but any other information or record in the possession
 21  4 of the EDA with respect to the program shall be presumed by
 21  5 the EDA to be a trade secret protected under Code chapter 550
 21  6 or common law and shall be kept confidential by the EDA unless
 21  7 otherwise ordered by a court.
 21  8    The division takes effect upon enactment and applies to
 21  9 renewable chemicals produced in Iowa from biomass feedstock on
 21 10 or after that date.  The division applies retroactively to tax
 21 11 years beginning on or after January 1, 2015.
 21 12    DIVISION II ==== ANGEL INVESTOR TAX CREDITS.   Division II
 21 13 makes several changes to the tax credit for investments in
 21 14 qualifying businesses and community=based seed capital funds,
 21 15 often referred to as the angel investor tax credits.  The
 21 16 division amends the purpose of the tax credit in Code section
 21 17 15E.41.  The division excludes investments in community=based
 21 18 seed capital funds from qualifying for the tax credit and
 21 19 makes several conforming amendments to remove references to
 21 20 community=based seed capital funds from the Code.
 21 21    The division modifies the amount and dollar limitation of
 21 22 the tax credit for a taxpayer.  The tax credit is increased
 21 23 from 20 percent to 25 percent of a taxpayer's equity investment
 21 24 in a qualifying business.  Under current law, a taxpayer cannot
 21 25 claim more than $50,000 of tax credit per investment in a
 21 26 qualifying business, and for each tax year a taxpayer and the
 21 27 taxpayer's affiliates cannot claim tax credits for more than
 21 28 five investments in five different qualifying businesses.  The
 21 29 division amends this dollar limitation to prohibit a natural
 21 30 person and the person's spouse, child, or sibling from claiming
 21 31 a combined amount of more than $100,000 in tax credits per tax
 21 32 year.
 21 33    The division also provides that no more than $500,000 in tax
 21 34 credits may be issued per tax year for equity investments in
 21 35 any one qualifying business.
 22  1 The division modifies the procedures for claiming the tax
 22  2 credit.  Under current law, the tax credit is not refundable
 22  3 but available for carryforward for up to five tax years.  The
 22  4 division makes the tax credit refundable for an investment
 22  5 made by a natural person, and for any other person reduces the
 22  6 carryforward period to three years.
 22  7    The division strikes a provision permitting the EDA
 22  8 to cooperate with small business development centers to
 22  9 disseminate information regarding the credits and to develop
 22 10 standard application forms, and requiring the EDA to distribute
 22 11 copies of the application forms to all community=based seed
 22 12 capital funds and potential individual investors.
 22 13    The division modifies the eligibility requirements for
 22 14 qualifying businesses.  The division strikes the requirement
 22 15 that a business have an owner that meets at least one of
 22 16 four qualifications relating to business education or
 22 17 business experience.  The division requires that a business
 22 18 be participating in an entrepreneurial assistance program,
 22 19 as defined in the division, but allows the EDA to waive this
 22 20 requirement if the business establishes that its owners,
 22 21 directors, officers, and employees have an appropriate level
 22 22 of experience such that an entrepreneurial assistance program
 22 23 would not materially change the prospects of the business.
 22 24 The EDA is allowed to consult with outside service providers
 22 25 in considering such a waiver.  The division increases from $5
 22 26 million to $10 million the maximum amount of net worth that
 22 27 a business may have to be considered a qualifying business.
 22 28 The division increases from $250,000 to $500,000 the amount of
 22 29 financing that a business must have in order to be considered a
 22 30 qualifying business, removes "near equity" from the types of
 22 31 financing that will be considered in that calculation, requires
 22 32 that the financing be secured at the time of application for
 22 33 the tax credits, and requires that the business have at least
 22 34 two investors at the time of application for the tax credits.
 22 35 These modified eligibility requirements apply to businesses
 23  1 that submit an application to the EDA to be registered as a
 23  2 qualifying business on or after the effective date of this
 23  3 division of the bill, and businesses that submitted such an
 23  4 application to the EDA before the effective date of this
 23  5 division of the bill shall be governed by current law.
 23  6    The division provides for the confidentiality of certain
 23  7 information with regard to the tax credit.  The identity of
 23  8 a qualifying business, the identity of an investor and the
 23  9 qualifying business in which the investor made an equity
 23 10 investment, and the total number and amount of tax credits
 23 11 issued shall be considered public information under Code
 23 12 chapter 22 (examination of public records), but any other
 23 13 information or record in the possession of the EDA with respect
 23 14 to the program shall be presumed by the EDA to be a trade secret
 23 15 protected under Code chapter 550 or common law and shall be
 23 16 kept confidential by the EDA unless otherwise ordered by a
 23 17 court.
 23 18    The division takes effect upon enactment and applies to
 23 19 equity investments in a qualifying business made on or after
 23 20 that date.  Equity investments in a qualifying business or
 23 21 community=based seed capital fund made prior to the effective
 23 22 date of the division shall be governed by current law.
 23 23    DIVISION III ==== ENTREPRENEUR INVESTMENT AWARDS PROGRAM.
 23 24  Division III amends the entrepreneur investment awards program
 23 25 administered by the EDA.  The division strikes provisions that
 23 26 prohibited the EDA from making awards under the program since
 23 27 July 1, 2014, and that required the EDA by December 31, 2014,
 23 28 to conduct a comprehensive review of the program and submit
 23 29 a report with specified information to the governor and the
 23 30 general assembly.
 23 31    The division modifies the purpose of the program to be
 23 32 to provide financial assistance to eligible entrepreneurial
 23 33 assistance providers (provider) that provide technical and
 23 34 financial assistance to entrepreneurs and start=up companies
 23 35 seeking to create, locate, or expand a business in Iowa.
 24  1 "Financial assistance" is defined in the division.
 24  2    The division changes the requirements for receiving an
 24  3 award.  To be eligible to receive an award under current
 24  4 law, an entrepreneurial assistance program must have been
 24  5 an Iowa=based business, expended at least $500,000 during
 24  6 the previous fiscal year to provide technical and financial
 24  7 assistance services that meet the broad=based needs of
 24  8 entrepreneurs seeking to create, locate, or expand a business
 24  9 in Iowa that intends to derive more than 10 percent of its
 24 10 gross sales from markets outside Iowa; and must have engaged
 24 11 and communicated with certain other programs, funding sources,
 24 12 and entities for its entrepreneur clients.  The division
 24 13 amends the eligibility for receiving financial assistance to
 24 14 require that a provider have its principal place of operations
 24 15 in Iowa and that the provider offer a comprehensive set of
 24 16 business development services to emerging and early=stage
 24 17 innovation companies to assist in the creation, location,
 24 18 growth, and long=term success of the company in Iowa.
 24 19 "Business development services" is defined in the division.
 24 20 Business development services may be performed at the physical
 24 21 location of the provider or the company and may be provided in
 24 22 consideration of equity participation in the company, a fee for
 24 23 services, or a membership agreement with the company.
 24 24    Under current law, the EDA board could approve, deny, or
 24 25 defer each application for a grant, and was required to award
 24 26 grants on a first=come, first=served basis.  The division
 24 27 specifies that the EDA board has the discretion to approve,
 24 28 deny, or defer each application for financial assistance and
 24 29 that the amount of financial assistance awarded to a provider
 24 30 is within the discretion of the EDA.  The division requires
 24 31 the EDA to award financial assistance on a competitive basis
 24 32 and allows the EDA to develop scoring criteria and establish
 24 33 minimum requirements for the receipt of a financial assistance
 24 34 award.
 24 35    In addition to the four factors relating to the provider's
 25  1 professional staff that the EDA may consider under current
 25  2 law in deciding whether to award financial assistance, the
 25  3 division provides that the EDA may also consider the service
 25  4 model and likelihood of success of the provider, the provider's
 25  5 similarity to other successful providers in the country, and
 25  6 the provider's financial need.
 25  7    The division modifies the maximum award amount for a
 25  8 recipient.  Under current law, a grant to an entrepreneur
 25  9 assistance program cannot exceed the lesser of 25 percent of
 25 10 the funds expended by the program during the previous fiscal
 25 11 year, 100 percent of the funds raised from certain persons
 25 12 by the program during the previous fiscal year, or $200,000.
 25 13 The division provides that the amount of financial assistance
 25 14 awarded to any one provider shall not exceed $200,000.
 25 15    The division modifies the permitted use of funds received
 25 16 under the program.  Under current law, grants are only
 25 17 permitted to be used for the purpose of operating costs
 25 18 incurred by the program.  The division specifies that financial
 25 19 assistance awarded to a provider shall only be used for
 25 20 the purpose of operating costs incurred by the provider in
 25 21 the provision of business development services to emerging
 25 22 and early=stage innovation companies in Iowa.  The division
 25 23 further requires that such financial assistance shall not be
 25 24 distributed to owners or investors of the company to which the
 25 25 business development services are being provided and shall not
 25 26 be provided to other persons assisting with the provision of
 25 27 the services.
 25 28    Under current law, an entrepreneurial assistance provider is
 25 29 required to accept client referrals from the EDA as a condition
 25 30 of receiving a grant.  The division provides that the EDA may
 25 31 make client referrals to eligible providers.
 25 32    DIVISION IV ==== MISCELLANEOUS CHANGES.  Division IV makes
 25 33 several miscellaneous changes to other EDA programs.  The
 25 34 division amends the sales and use tax refund available under
 25 35 the workforce housing tax incentive program.  That refund
 26  1 is available for sales and use tax paid prior to project
 26  2 completion, which is currently defined to mean the first date
 26  3 upon which the average annualized production of finished
 26  4 product for the preceding 90=day period at the manufacturing
 26  5 facility operated by the eligible business is at least 50
 26  6 percent of the initial design capacity of the facility.  The
 26  7 division amends the definition of "project completion" to mean
 26  8 the date on which the EDA notifies the department of revenue
 26  9 that all applicable requirements of a workforce housing tax
 26 10 incentive program agreement are satisfied.  This provision
 26 11 takes effect upon enactment and applies retroactively to July
 26 12 1, 2014, for all workforce housing tax incentive agreements
 26 13 entered into on or after that date.
 26 14    The division allows the EDA to extend the project
 26 15 completion date for a project awarded tax incentives under the
 26 16 redevelopment tax credit program and the housing enterprise
 26 17 zone tax incentives program if the property that is the subject
 26 18 of the project suffered a catastrophic fire during the 2014

 20 33 list.
 20 34    The division provides for the confidentiality of certain
 20 35 information under the program.  The identity of a tax credit
 21  1 recipient and the amount of the tax credit shall be considered
 21  2 public information under Code chapter 22 (examination of public

 21 12    DIVISION II ==== ANGEL INVESTOR TAX CREDITS.   Division II
 21 13 makes several changes to the tax credit for investments in
 21 14 qualifying businesses and community=based seed capital funds,
 21 15 often referred to as the angel investor tax credits.  The
 21 16 division amends the purpose of the tax credit in Code section

 21 18 seed capital funds from qualifying for the tax credit and
 21 19 makes several conforming amendments to remove references to
 21 20 community=based seed capital funds from the Code.
 21 21    The division modifies the amount and dollar limitation of
 21 22 the tax credit for a taxpayer.  The tax credit is increased
 21 23 from 20 percent to 25 percent of a taxpayer's equity investment
 21 24 in a qualifying business.  Under current law, a taxpayer cannot
 21 25 claim more than $50,000 of tax credit per investment in a
 21 26 qualifying business, and for each tax year a taxpayer and the
 21 27 taxpayer's affiliates cannot claim tax credits for more than
 21 28 five investments in five different qualifying businesses.  The
 21 29 division amends this dollar limitation to prohibit a natural
 21 30 person and the person's spouse, child, or sibling from claiming
 21 31 a combined amount of more than $100,000 in tax credits per tax
 21 32 year.
 21 33    The division also provides that no more than $500,000 in tax
 21 34 credits may be issued per tax year for equity investments in
 21 35 any one qualifying business.
 22  1 The division modifies the procedures for claiming the tax
 22  2 credit.  Under current law, the tax credit is not refundable
 22  3 but available for carryforward for up to five tax years.  The
 22  4 division makes the tax credit refundable for an investment
 22  5 made by a natural person, and for any other person reduces the
 22  6 carryforward period to three years.
 22  7    The division strikes a provision permitting the EDA
 22  8 to cooperate with small business development centers to
 22  9 disseminate information regarding the credits and to develop
 22 10 standard application forms, and requiring the EDA to distribute
 22 11 copies of the application forms to all community=based seed
 22 12 capital funds and potential individual investors.
 22 13    The division modifies the eligibility requirements for
 22 14 qualifying businesses.  The division strikes the requirement
 22 15 that a business have an owner that meets at least one of
 22 16 four qualifications relating to business education or
 22 17 business experience.  The division requires that a business
 22 18 be participating in an entrepreneurial assistance program,
 22 19 as defined in the division, but allows the EDA to waive this
 22 20 requirement if the business establishes that its owners,
 22 21 directors, officers, and employees have an appropriate level
 22 22 of experience such that an entrepreneurial assistance program
 22 23 would not materially change the prospects of the business.
 22 24 The EDA is allowed to consult with outside service providers
 22 25 in considering such a waiver.  The division increases from $5
 22 26 million to $10 million the maximum amount of net worth that
 22 27 a business may have to be considered a qualifying business.
 22 28 The division increases from $250,000 to $500,000 the amount of
 22 29 financing that a business must have in order to be considered a
 22 30 qualifying business, removes "near equity" from the types of
 22 31 financing that will be considered in that calculation, requires
 22 32 that the financing be secured at the time of application for
 22 33 the tax credits, and requires that the business have at least
 22 34 two investors at the time of application for the tax credits.
 22 35 These modified eligibility requirements apply to businesses
 23  1 that submit an application to the EDA to be registered as a
 23  2 qualifying business on or after the effective date of this
 23  3 division of the bill, and businesses that submitted such an
 23  4 application to the EDA before the effective date of this
 23  5 division of the bill shall be governed by current law.
 23  6    The division provides for the confidentiality of certain
 23  7 information with regard to the tax credit.  The identity of
 23  8 a qualifying business, the identity of an investor and the
 23  9 qualifying business in which the investor made an equity
 23 10 investment, and the total number and amount of tax credits
 23 11 issued shall be considered public information under Code
 23 12 chapter 22 (examination of public records), but any other
 23 13 information or record in the possession of the EDA with respect
 23 14 to the program shall be presumed by the EDA to be a trade secret
 23 15 protected under Code chapter 550 or common law and shall be
 23 16 kept confidential by the EDA unless otherwise ordered by a
 23 17 court.
 23 18    The division takes effect upon enactment and applies to
 23 19 equity investments in a qualifying business made on or after
 23 20 that date.  Equity investments in a qualifying business or
 23 21 community=based seed capital fund made prior to the effective
 23 22 date of the division shall be governed by current law.
 23 23    DIVISION III ==== ENTREPRENEUR INVESTMENT AWARDS PROGRAM.
 23 24  Division III amends the entrepreneur investment awards program
 23 25 administered by the EDA.  The division strikes provisions that
 23 26 prohibited the EDA from making awards under the program since
 23 27 July 1, 2014, and that required the EDA by December 31, 2014,
 23 28 to conduct a comprehensive review of the program and submit
 23 29 a report with specified information to the governor and the
 23 30 general assembly.
 23 31    The division modifies the purpose of the program to be
 23 32 to provide financial assistance to eligible entrepreneurial
 23 33 assistance providers (provider) that provide technical and
 23 34 financial assistance to entrepreneurs and start=up companies
 23 35 seeking to create, locate, or expand a business in Iowa.
 24  1 "Financial assistance" is defined in the division.
 24  2    The division changes the requirements for receiving an
 24  3 award.  To be eligible to receive an award under current
 24  4 law, an entrepreneurial assistance program must have been
 24  5 an Iowa=based business, expended at least $500,000 during
 24  6 the previous fiscal year to provide technical and financial
 24  7 assistance services that meet the broad=based needs of
 24  8 entrepreneurs seeking to create, locate, or expand a business
 24  9 in Iowa that intends to derive more than 10 percent of its
 24 10 gross sales from markets outside Iowa; and must have engaged
 24 11 and communicated with certain other programs, funding sources,
 24 12 and entities for its entrepreneur clients.  The division
 24 13 amends the eligibility for receiving financial assistance to
 24 14 require that a provider have its principal place of operations
 24 15 in Iowa and that the provider offer a comprehensive set of
 24 16 business development services to emerging and early=stage
 24 17 innovation companies to assist in the creation, location,
 24 18 growth, and long=term success of the company in Iowa.
 24 19 "Business development services" is defined in the division.
 24 20 Business development services may be performed at the physical
 24 21 location of the provider or the company and may be provided in
 24 22 consideration of equity participation in the company, a fee for
 24 23 services, or a membership agreement with the company.
 24 24    Under current law, the EDA board could approve, deny, or
 24 25 defer each application for a grant, and was required to award
 24 26 grants on a first=come, first=served basis.  The division
 24 27 specifies that the EDA board has the discretion to approve,
 24 28 deny, or defer each application for financial assistance and
 24 29 that the amount of financial assistance awarded to a provider
 24 30 is within the discretion of the EDA.  The division requires
 24 31 the EDA to award financial assistance on a competitive basis
 24 32 and allows the EDA to develop scoring criteria and establish
 24 33 minimum requirements for the receipt of a financial assistance
 24 34 award.
 24 35    In addition to the four factors relating to the provider's
 25  1 professional staff that the EDA may consider under current
 25  2 law in deciding whether to award financial assistance, the
 25  3 division provides that the EDA may also consider the service
 25  4 model and likelihood of success of the provider, the provider's
 25  5 similarity to other successful providers in the country, and
 25  6 the provider's financial need.
 25  7    The division modifies the maximum award amount for a
 25  8 recipient.  Under current law, a grant to an entrepreneur
 25  9 assistance program cannot exceed the lesser of 25 percent of
 25 10 the funds expended by the program during the previous fiscal
 25 11 year, 100 percent of the funds raised from certain persons
 25 12 by the program during the previous fiscal year, or $200,000.
 25 13 The division provides that the amount of financial assistance
 25 14 awarded to any one provider shall not exceed $200,000.
 25 15    The division modifies the permitted use of funds received
 25 16 under the program.  Under current law, grants are only
 25 17 permitted to be used for the purpose of operating costs
 25 18 incurred by the program.  The division specifies that financial
 25 19 assistance awarded to a provider shall only be used for
 25 20 the purpose of operating costs incurred by the provider in
 25 21 the provision of business development services to emerging
 25 22 and early=stage innovation companies in Iowa.  The division
 25 23 further requires that such financial assistance shall not be
 25 24 distributed to owners or investors of the company to which the
 25 25 business development services are being provided and shall not
 25 26 be provided to other persons assisting with the provision of
 25 27 the services.
 25 28    Under current law, an entrepreneurial assistance provider is
 25 29 required to accept client referrals from the EDA as a condition
 25 30 of receiving a grant.  The division provides that the EDA may
 25 31 make client referrals to eligible providers.
 25 32    DIVISION IV ==== MISCELLANEOUS CHANGES.  Division IV makes
 25 33 several miscellaneous changes to other EDA programs.  The
 25 34 division amends the sales and use tax refund available under
 25 35 the workforce housing tax incentive program.  That refund
 26  1 is available for sales and use tax paid prior to project
 26  2 completion, which is currently defined to mean the first date
 26  3 upon which the average annualized production of finished
 26  4 product for the preceding 90=day period at the manufacturing
 26  5 facility operated by the eligible business is at least 50
 26  6 percent of the initial design capacity of the facility.  The
 26  7 division amends the definition of "project completion" to mean
 26  8 the date on which the EDA notifies the department of revenue
 26  9 that all applicable requirements of a workforce housing tax
 26 10 incentive program agreement are satisfied.  This provision
 26 11 takes effect upon enactment and applies retroactively to July
 26 12 1, 2014, for all workforce housing tax incentive agreements
 26 13 entered into on or after that date.
 26 14    The division allows the EDA to extend the project
 26 15 completion date for a project awarded tax incentives under the
 26 16 redevelopment tax credit program and the housing enterprise
 26 17 zone tax incentives program if the property that is the subject
 26 18 of the project suffered a catastrophic fire during the 2014
 26 19 calendar year.
       LSB 1212HV (3) 86
       mm/sc
 20 31 the EDA is required to establish a wait list and give priority
 20 32 in subsequent years to the eligible businesses on the wait
 20 33 list.
 20 34    The division provides for the confidentiality of certain
 20 35 information under the program.  The identity of a tax credit
 21  1 recipient and the amount of the tax credit shall be considered
 21  2 public information under Code chapter 22 (examination of public
 21  3 records), but any other information or record in the possession
 21  4 of the EDA with respect to the program shall be presumed by
 21  5 the EDA to be a trade secret protected under Code chapter 550
 21  6 or common law and shall be kept confidential by the EDA unless
 21  7 otherwise ordered by a court.
 21  8    The division takes effect upon enactment and applies to
 21  9 renewable chemicals produced in Iowa from biomass feedstock on
 21 10 or after that date.  The division applies retroactively to tax
 21 11 years beginning on or after January 1, 2015.
 21 12    DIVISION II ==== ANGEL INVESTOR TAX CREDITS.   Division II
 21 13 makes several changes to the tax credit for investments in
 21 14 qualifying businesses and community=based seed capital funds,
 21 15 often referred to as the angel investor tax credits.  The
 21 16 division amends the purpose of the tax credit in Code section
 21 17 15E.41.  The division excludes investments in community=based
 21 18 seed capital funds from qualifying for the tax credit and
 21 19 makes several conforming amendments to remove references to
 21 20 community=based seed capital funds from the Code.
 21 21    The division modifies the amount and dollar limitation of
 21 22 the tax credit for a taxpayer.  The tax credit is increased
 21 23 from 20 percent to 25 percent of a taxpayer's equity investment
 21 24 in a qualifying business.  Under current law, a taxpayer cannot
 21 25 claim more than $50,000 of tax credit per investment in a
 21 26 qualifying business, and for each tax year a taxpayer and the
 21 27 taxpayer's affiliates cannot claim tax credits for more than
 21 28 five investments in five different qualifying businesses.  The
 21 29 division amends this dollar limitation to prohibit a natural
 21 30 person and the person's spouse, child, or sibling from claiming
 21 31 a combined amount of more than $100,000 in tax credits per tax
 21 32 year.
 21 33    The division also provides that no more than $500,000 in tax
 21 34 credits may be issued per tax year for equity investments in
 21 35 any one qualifying business.
 22  1 The division modifies the procedures for claiming the tax
 22  2 credit.  Under current law, the tax credit is not refundable
 22  3 but available for carryforward for up to five tax years.  The
 22  4 division makes the tax credit refundable for an investment
 22  5 made by a natural person, and for any other person reduces the
 22  6 carryforward period to three years.
 22  7    The division strikes a provision permitting the EDA
 22  8 to cooperate with small business development centers to
 22  9 disseminate information regarding the credits and to develop
 22 10 standard application forms, and requiring the EDA to distribute
 22 11 copies of the application forms to all community=based seed
 22 12 capital funds and potential individual investors.
 22 13    The division modifies the eligibility requirements for
 22 14 qualifying businesses.  The division strikes the requirement
 22 15 that a business have an owner that meets at least one of
 22 16 four qualifications relating to business education or
 22 17 business experience.  The division requires that a business
 22 18 be participating in an entrepreneurial assistance program,
 22 19 as defined in the division, but allows the EDA to waive this
 22 20 requirement if the business establishes that its owners,
 22 21 directors, officers, and employees have an appropriate level
 22 22 of experience such that an entrepreneurial assistance program
 22 23 would not materially change the prospects of the business.
 22 24 The EDA is allowed to consult with outside service providers
 22 25 in considering such a waiver.  The division increases from $5
 22 26 million to $10 million the maximum amount of net worth that
 22 27 a business may have to be considered a qualifying business.
 22 28 The division increases from $250,000 to $500,000 the amount of
 22 29 financing that a business must have in order to be considered a
 22 30 qualifying business, removes "near equity" from the types of
 22 31 financing that will be considered in that calculation, requires
 22 32 that the financing be secured at the time of application for
 22 33 the tax credits, and requires that the business have at least
 22 34 two investors at the time of application for the tax credits.
 22 35 These modified eligibility requirements apply to businesses
 23  1 that submit an application to the EDA to be registered as a
 23  2 qualifying business on or after the effective date of this
 23  3 division of the bill, and businesses that submitted such an
 23  4 application to the EDA before the effective date of this
 23  5 division of the bill shall be governed by current law.
 23  6    The division provides for the confidentiality of certain
 23  7 information with regard to the tax credit.  The identity of
 23  8 a qualifying business, the identity of an investor and the
 23  9 qualifying business in which the investor made an equity
 23 10 investment, and the total number and amount of tax credits
 23 11 issued shall be considered public information under Code
 23 12 chapter 22 (examination of public records), but any other
 23 13 information or record in the possession of the EDA with respect
 23 14 to the program shall be presumed by the EDA to be a trade secret
 23 15 protected under Code chapter 550 or common law and shall be
 23 16 kept confidential by the EDA unless otherwise ordered by a
 23 17 court.
 23 18    The division takes effect upon enactment and applies to
 23 19 equity investments in a qualifying business made on or after
 23 20 that date.  Equity investments in a qualifying business or
 23 21 community=based seed capital fund made prior to the effective
 23 22 date of the division shall be governed by current law.
 23 23    DIVISION III ==== ENTREPRENEUR INVESTMENT AWARDS PROGRAM.
 23 24  Division III amends the entrepreneur investment awards program
 23 25 administered by the EDA.  The division strikes provisions that
 23 26 prohibited the EDA from making awards under the program since
 23 27 July 1, 2014, and that required the EDA by December 31, 2014,
 23 28 to conduct a comprehensive review of the program and submit
 23 29 a report with specified information to the governor and the
 23 30 general assembly.
 23 31    The division modifies the purpose of the program to be
 23 32 to provide financial assistance to eligible entrepreneurial
 23 33 assistance providers (provider) that provide technical and
 23 34 financial assistance to entrepreneurs and start=up companies
 23 35 seeking to create, locate, or expand a business in Iowa.
 24  1 "Financial assistance" is defined in the division.
 24  2    The division changes the requirements for receiving an
 24  3 award.  To be eligible to receive an award under current
 24  4 law, an entrepreneurial assistance program must have been
 24  5 an Iowa=based business, expended at least $500,000 during
 24  6 the previous fiscal year to provide technical and financial
 24  7 assistance services that meet the broad=based needs of
 24  8 entrepreneurs seeking to create, locate, or expand a business
 24  9 in Iowa that intends to derive more than 10 percent of its
 24 10 gross sales from markets outside Iowa; and must have engaged
 24 11 and communicated with certain other programs, funding sources,
 24 12 and entities for its entrepreneur clients.  The division
 24 13 amends the eligibility for receiving financial assistance to
 24 14 require that a provider have its principal place of operations
 24 15 in Iowa and that the provider offer a comprehensive set of
 24 16 business development services to emerging and early=stage
 24 17 innovation companies to assist in the creation, location,
 24 18 growth, and long=term success of the company in Iowa.
 24 19 "Business development services" is defined in the division.
 24 20 Business development services may be performed at the physical
 24 21 location of the provider or the company and may be provided in
 24 22 consideration of equity participation in the company, a fee for
 24 23 services, or a membership agreement with the company.
 24 24    Under current law, the EDA board could approve, deny, or
 24 25 defer each application for a grant, and was required to award
 24 26 grants on a first=come, first=served basis.  The division
 24 27 specifies that the EDA board has the discretion to approve,
 24 28 deny, or defer each application for financial assistance and
 24 29 that the amount of financial assistance awarded to a provider
 24 30 is within the discretion of the EDA.  The division requires
 24 31 the EDA to award financial assistance on a competitive basis
 24 32 and allows the EDA to develop scoring criteria and establish
 24 33 minimum requirements for the receipt of a financial assistance
 24 34 award.
 24 35    In addition to the four factors relating to the provider's
 25  1 professional staff that the EDA may consider under current
 25  2 law in deciding whether to award financial assistance, the
 25  3 division provides that the EDA may also consider the service
 25  4 model and likelihood of success of the provider, the provider's
 25  5 similarity to other successful providers in the country, and
 25  6 the provider's financial need.
 25  7    The division modifies the maximum award amount for a
 25  8 recipient.  Under current law, a grant to an entrepreneur
 25  9 assistance program cannot exceed the lesser of 25 percent of
 25 10 the funds expended by the program during the previous fiscal
 25 11 year, 100 percent of the funds raised from certain persons
 25 12 by the program during the previous fiscal year, or $200,000.
 25 13 The division provides that the amount of financial assistance
 25 14 awarded to any one provider shall not exceed $200,000.
 25 15    The division modifies the permitted use of funds received
 25 16 under the program.  Under current law, grants are only
 25 17 permitted to be used for the purpose of operating costs
 25 18 incurred by the program.  The division specifies that financial
 25 19 assistance awarded to a provider shall only be used for
 25 20 the purpose of operating costs incurred by the provider in
 25 21 the provision of business development services to emerging
 25 22 and early=stage innovation companies in Iowa.  The division
 25 23 further requires that such financial assistance shall not be
 25 24 distributed to owners or investors of the company to which the
 25 25 business development services are being provided and shall not
 25 26 be provided to other persons assisting with the provision of
 25 27 the services.
 25 28    Under current law, an entrepreneurial assistance provider is
 25 29 required to accept client referrals from the EDA as a condition
 25 30 of receiving a grant.  The division provides that the EDA may
 25 31 make client referrals to eligible providers.
 25 32    DIVISION IV ==== MISCELLANEOUS CHANGES.  Division IV makes
 25 33 several miscellaneous changes to other EDA programs.  The
 25 34 division amends the sales and use tax refund available under
 25 35 the workforce housing tax incentive program.  That refund
 26  1 is available for sales and use tax paid prior to project
 26  2 completion, which is currently defined to mean the first date
 26  3 upon which the average annualized production of finished
 26  4 product for the preceding 90=day period at the manufacturing
 26  5 facility operated by the eligible business is at least 50
 26  6 percent of the initial design capacity of the facility.  The
 26  7 division amends the definition of "project completion" to mean
 26  8 the date on which the EDA notifies the department of revenue
 26  9 that all applicable requirements of a workforce housing tax
 26 10 incentive program agreement are satisfied.  This provision
 26 11 takes effect upon enactment and applies retroactively to July
 26 12 1, 2014, for all workforce housing tax incentive agreements
 26 13 entered into on or after that date.
 26 14    The division allows the EDA to extend the project
 26 15 completion date for a project awarded tax incentives under the
 26 16 redevelopment tax credit program and the housing enterprise
 26 17 zone tax incentives program if the property that is the subject
 26 18 of the project suffered a catastrophic fire during the 2014
 26 19 calendar year.

 20 34    The division provides for the confidentiality of certain
 20 35 information under the program.  The identity of a tax credit
 21  1 recipient and the amount of the tax credit shall be considered
 21  2 public information under Code chapter 22 (examination of public
 21  3 records), but any other information or record in the possession
 21  4 of the EDA with respect to the program shall be presumed by
 21  5 the EDA to be a trade secret protected under Code chapter 550
 21  6 or common law and shall be kept confidential by the EDA unless
 21  7 otherwise ordered by a court.
 21  8    The division takes effect upon enactment and applies to
 21  9 renewable chemicals produced in Iowa from biomass feedstock on
 21 10 or after that date.  The division applies retroactively to tax
 21 11 years beginning on or after January 1, 2015.
 21 12    DIVISION II ==== ANGEL INVESTOR TAX CREDITS.   Division II
 21 13 makes several changes to the tax credit for investments in
 21 14 qualifying businesses and community=based seed capital funds,
 21 15 often referred to as the angel investor tax credits.  The
 21 16 division amends the purpose of the tax credit in Code section
 21 17 15E.41.  The division excludes investments in community=based
 21 18 seed capital funds from qualifying for the tax credit and
 21 19 makes several conforming amendments to remove references to
 21 20 community=based seed capital funds from the Code.
 21 21    The division modifies the amount and dollar limitation of
 21 22 the tax credit for a taxpayer.  The tax credit is increased
 21 23 from 20 percent to 25 percent of a taxpayer's equity investment
 21 24 in a qualifying business.  Under current law, a taxpayer cannot
 21 25 claim more than $50,000 of tax credit per investment in a
 21 26 qualifying business, and for each tax year a taxpayer and the
 21 27 taxpayer's affiliates cannot claim tax credits for more than
 21 28 five investments in five different qualifying businesses.  The
 21 29 division amends this dollar limitation to prohibit a natural
 21 30 person and the person's spouse, child, or sibling from claiming
 21 31 a combined amount of more than $100,000 in tax credits per tax
 21 32 year.
 21 33    The division also provides that no more than $500,000 in tax
 21 34 credits may be issued per tax year for equity investments in
 21 35 any one qualifying business.
 22  1 The division modifies the procedures for claiming the tax
 22  2 credit.  Under current law, the tax credit is not refundable
 22  3 but available for carryforward for up to five tax years.  The
 22  4 division makes the tax credit refundable for an investment
 22  5 made by a natural person, and for any other person reduces the
 22  6 carryforward period to three years.
 22  7    The division strikes a provision permitting the EDA
 22  8 to cooperate with small business development centers to
 22  9 disseminate information regarding the credits and to develop
 22 10 standard application forms, and requiring the EDA to distribute
 22 11 copies of the application forms to all community=based seed
 22 12 capital funds and potential individual investors.
 22 13    The division modifies the eligibility requirements for
 22 14 qualifying businesses.  The division strikes the requirement
 22 15 that a business have an owner that meets at least one of
 22 16 four qualifications relating to business education or
 22 17 business experience.  The division requires that a business
 22 18 be participating in an entrepreneurial assistance program,
 22 19 as defined in the division, but allows the EDA to waive this
 22 20 requirement if the business establishes that its owners,
 22 21 directors, officers, and employees have an appropriate level
 22 22 of experience such that an entrepreneurial assistance program
 22 23 would not materially change the prospects of the business.
 22 24 The EDA is allowed to consult with outside service providers
 22 25 in considering such a waiver.  The division increases from $5
 22 26 million to $10 million the maximum amount of net worth that
 22 27 a business may have to be considered a qualifying business.
 22 28 The division increases from $250,000 to $500,000 the amount of
 22 29 financing that a business must have in order to be considered a
 22 30 qualifying business, removes "near equity" from the types of
 22 31 financing that will be considered in that calculation, requires
 22 32 that the financing be secured at the time of application for
 22 33 the tax credits, and requires that the business have at least
 22 34 two investors at the time of application for the tax credits.
 22 35 These modified eligibility requirements apply to businesses
 23  1 that submit an application to the EDA to be registered as a
 23  2 qualifying business on or after the effective date of this
 23  3 division of the bill, and businesses that submitted such an
 23  4 application to the EDA before the effective date of this
 23  5 division of the bill shall be governed by current law.
 23  6    The division provides for the confidentiality of certain
 23  7 information with regard to the tax credit.  The identity of
 23  8 a qualifying business, the identity of an investor and the
 23  9 qualifying business in which the investor made an equity
 23 10 investment, and the total number and amount of tax credits
 23 11 issued shall be considered public information under Code
 23 12 chapter 22 (examination of public records), but any other
 23 13 information or record in the possession of the EDA with respect
 23 14 to the program shall be presumed by the EDA to be a trade secret
 23 15 protected under Code chapter 550 or common law and shall be
 23 16 kept confidential by the EDA unless otherwise ordered by a
 23 17 court.
 23 18    The division takes effect upon enactment and applies to
 23 19 equity investments in a qualifying business made on or after
 23 20 that date.  Equity investments in a qualifying business or
 23 21 community=based seed capital fund made prior to the effective
 23 22 date of the division shall be governed by current law.
 23 23    DIVISION III ==== ENTREPRENEUR INVESTMENT AWARDS PROGRAM.
 23 24  Division III amends the entrepreneur investment awards program
 23 25 administered by the EDA.  The division strikes provisions that
 23 26 prohibited the EDA from making awards under the program since
 23 27 July 1, 2014, and that required the EDA by December 31, 2014,
 23 28 to conduct a comprehensive review of the program and submit
 23 29 a report with specified information to the governor and the
 23 30 general assembly.
 23 31    The division modifies the purpose of the program to be
 23 32 to provide financial assistance to eligible entrepreneurial
 23 33 assistance providers (provider) that provide technical and
 23 34 financial assistance to entrepreneurs and start=up companies
 23 35 seeking to create, locate, or expand a business in Iowa.
 24  1 "Financial assistance" is defined in the division.
 24  2    The division changes the requirements for receiving an
 24  3 award.  To be eligible to receive an award under current
 24  4 law, an entrepreneurial assistance program must have been
 24  5 an Iowa=based business, expended at least $500,000 during
 24  6 the previous fiscal year to provide technical and financial
 24  7 assistance services that meet the broad=based needs of
 24  8 entrepreneurs seeking to create, locate, or expand a business
 24  9 in Iowa that intends to derive more than 10 percent of its
 24 10 gross sales from markets outside Iowa; and must have engaged
 24 11 and communicated with certain other programs, funding sources,
 24 12 and entities for its entrepreneur clients.  The division
 24 13 amends the eligibility for receiving financial assistance to
 24 14 require that a provider have its principal place of operations
 24 15 in Iowa and that the provider offer a comprehensive set of
 24 16 business development services to emerging and early=stage
 24 17 innovation companies to assist in the creation, location,
 24 18 growth, and long=term success of the company in Iowa.
 24 19 "Business development services" is defined in the division.
 24 20 Business development services may be performed at the physical
 24 21 location of the provider or the company and may be provided in
 24 22 consideration of equity participation in the company, a fee for
 24 23 services, or a membership agreement with the company.
 24 24    Under current law, the EDA board could approve, deny, or
 24 25 defer each application for a grant, and was required to award
 24 26 grants on a first=come, first=served basis.  The division
 24 27 specifies that the EDA board has the discretion to approve,
 24 28 deny, or defer each application for financial assistance and
 24 29 that the amount of financial assistance awarded to a provider
 24 30 is within the discretion of the EDA.  The division requires
 24 31 the EDA to award financial assistance on a competitive basis
 24 32 and allows the EDA to develop scoring criteria and establish
 24 33 minimum requirements for the receipt of a financial assistance
 24 34 award.
 24 35    In addition to the four factors relating to the provider's
 25  1 professional staff that the EDA may consider under current
 25  2 law in deciding whether to award financial assistance, the
 25  3 division provides that the EDA may also consider the service
 25  4 model and likelihood of success of the provider, the provider's
 25  5 similarity to other successful providers in the country, and
 25  6 the provider's financial need.
 25  7    The division modifies the maximum award amount for a
 25  8 recipient.  Under current law, a grant to an entrepreneur
 25  9 assistance program cannot exceed the lesser of 25 percent of
 25 10 the funds expended by the program during the previous fiscal
 25 11 year, 100 percent of the funds raised from certain persons
 25 12 by the program during the previous fiscal year, or $200,000.
 25 13 The division provides that the amount of financial assistance
 25 14 awarded to any one provider shall not exceed $200,000.
 25 15    The division modifies the permitted use of funds received
 25 16 under the program.  Under current law, grants are only
 25 17 permitted to be used for the purpose of operating costs
 25 18 incurred by the program.  The division specifies that financial
 25 19 assistance awarded to a provider shall only be used for
 25 20 the purpose of operating costs incurred by the provider in
 25 21 the provision of business development services to emerging
 25 22 and early=stage innovation companies in Iowa.  The division
 25 23 further requires that such financial assistance shall not be
 25 24 distributed to owners or investors of the company to which the
 25 25 business development services are being provided and shall not
 25 26 be provided to other persons assisting with the provision of
 25 27 the services.
 25 28    Under current law, an entrepreneurial assistance provider is
 25 29 required to accept client referrals from the EDA as a condition
 25 30 of receiving a grant.  The division provides that the EDA may
 25 31 make client referrals to eligible providers.
 25 32    DIVISION IV ==== MISCELLANEOUS CHANGES.  Division IV makes
 25 33 several miscellaneous changes to other EDA programs.  The
 25 34 division amends the sales and use tax refund available under
 25 35 the workforce housing tax incentive program.  That refund
 26  1 is available for sales and use tax paid prior to project
 26  2 completion, which is currently defined to mean the first date
 26  3 upon which the average annualized production of finished
 26  4 product for the preceding 90=day period at the manufacturing
 26  5 facility operated by the eligible business is at least 50
 26  6 percent of the initial design capacity of the facility.  The
 26  7 division amends the definition of "project completion" to mean
 26  8 the date on which the EDA notifies the department of revenue
 26  9 that all applicable requirements of a workforce housing tax
 26 10 incentive program agreement are satisfied.  This provision
 26 11 takes effect upon enactment and applies retroactively to July
 26 12 1, 2014, for all workforce housing tax incentive agreements
 26 13 entered into on or after that date.
 26 14    The division allows the EDA to extend the project
 26 15 completion date for a project awarded tax incentives under the
 26 16 redevelopment tax credit program and the housing enterprise
 26 17 zone tax incentives program if the property that is the subject
 26 18 of the project suffered a catastrophic fire during the 2014
 26 19 calendar year.

 20 33 list.
 20 34    The division provides for the confidentiality of certain
 20 35 information under the program.  The identity of a tax credit
 21  1 recipient and the amount of the tax credit shall be considered
 21  2 public information under Code chapter 22 (examination of public
 21  3 records), but any other information or record in the possession
 21  4 of the EDA with respect to the program shall be presumed by
 21  5 the EDA to be a trade secret protected under Code chapter 550
 21  6 or common law and shall be kept confidential by the EDA unless
 21  7 otherwise ordered by a court.
 21  8    The division takes effect upon enactment and applies to
 21  9 renewable chemicals produced in Iowa from biomass feedstock on
 21 10 or after that date.  The division applies retroactively to tax
 21 11 years beginning on or after January 1, 2015.
 21 12    DIVISION II ==== ANGEL INVESTOR TAX CREDITS.   Division II
 21 13 makes several changes to the tax credit for investments in
 21 14 qualifying businesses and community=based seed capital funds,
 21 15 often referred to as the angel investor tax credits.  The
 21 16 division amends the purpose of the tax credit in Code section
 21 17 15E.41.  The division excludes investments in community=based
 21 18 seed capital funds from qualifying for the tax credit and
 21 19 makes several conforming amendments to remove references to
 21 20 community=based seed capital funds from the Code.
 21 21    The division modifies the amount and dollar limitation of
 21 22 the tax credit for a taxpayer.  The tax credit is increased
 21 23 from 20 percent to 25 percent of a taxpayer's equity investment
 21 24 in a qualifying business.  Under current law, a taxpayer cannot
 21 25 claim more than $50,000 of tax credit per investment in a
 21 26 qualifying business, and for each tax year a taxpayer and the
 21 27 taxpayer's affiliates cannot claim tax credits for more than
 21 28 five investments in five different qualifying businesses.  The
 21 29 division amends this dollar limitation to prohibit a natural
 21 30 person and the person's spouse, child, or sibling from claiming
 21 31 a combined amount of more than $100,000 in tax credits per tax
 21 32 year.
 21 33    The division also provides that no more than $500,000 in tax
 21 34 credits may be issued per tax year for equity investments in
 21 35 any one qualifying business.
 22  1 The division modifies the procedures for claiming the tax
 22  2 credit.  Under current law, the tax credit is not refundable
 22  3 but available for carryforward for up to five tax years.  The
 22  4 division makes the tax credit refundable for an investment
 22  5 made by a natural person, and for any other person reduces the
 22  6 carryforward period to three years.
 22  7    The division strikes a provision permitting the EDA
 22  8 to cooperate with small business development centers to
 22  9 disseminate information regarding the credits and to develop
 22 10 standard application forms, and requiring the EDA to distribute
 22 11 copies of the application forms to all community=based seed
 22 12 capital funds and potential individual investors.
 22 13    The division modifies the eligibility requirements for
 22 14 qualifying businesses.  The division strikes the requirement
 22 15 that a business have an owner that meets at least one of
 22 16 four qualifications relating to business education or
 22 17 business experience.  The division requires that a business
 22 18 be participating in an entrepreneurial assistance program,
 22 19 as defined in the division, but allows the EDA to waive this
 22 20 requirement if the business establishes that its owners,
 22 21 directors, officers, and employees have an appropriate level
 22 22 of experience such that an entrepreneurial assistance program
 22 23 would not materially change the prospects of the business.
 22 24 The EDA is allowed to consult with outside service providers
 22 25 in considering such a waiver.  The division increases from $5
 22 26 million to $10 million the maximum amount of net worth that
 22 27 a business may have to be considered a qualifying business.
 22 28 The division increases from $250,000 to $500,000 the amount of
 22 29 financing that a business must have in order to be considered a
 22 30 qualifying business, removes "near equity" from the types of
 22 31 financing that will be considered in that calculation, requires
 22 32 that the financing be secured at the time of application for
 22 33 the tax credits, and requires that the business have at least
 22 34 two investors at the time of application for the tax credits.
 22 35 These modified eligibility requirements apply to businesses
 23  1 that submit an application to the EDA to be registered as a
 23  2 qualifying business on or after the effective date of this
 23  3 division of the bill, and businesses that submitted such an
 23  4 application to the EDA before the effective date of this
 23  5 division of the bill shall be governed by current law.
 23  6    The division provides for the confidentiality of certain
 23  7 information with regard to the tax credit.  The identity of
 23  8 a qualifying business, the identity of an investor and the
 23  9 qualifying business in which the investor made an equity
 23 10 investment, and the total number and amount of tax credits
 23 11 issued shall be considered public information under Code
 23 12 chapter 22 (examination of public records), but any other
 23 13 information or record in the possession of the EDA with respect
 23 14 to the program shall be presumed by the EDA to be a trade secret
 23 15 protected under Code chapter 550 or common law and shall be
 23 16 kept confidential by the EDA unless otherwise ordered by a
 23 17 court.
 23 18    The division takes effect upon enactment and applies to
 23 19 equity investments in a qualifying business made on or after
 23 20 that date.  Equity investments in a qualifying business or
 23 21 community=based seed capital fund made prior to the effective
 23 22 date of the division shall be governed by current law.
 23 23    DIVISION III ==== ENTREPRENEUR INVESTMENT AWARDS PROGRAM.
 23 24  Division III amends the entrepreneur investment awards program
 23 25 administered by the EDA.  The division strikes provisions that
 23 26 prohibited the EDA from making awards under the program since
 23 27 July 1, 2014, and that required the EDA by December 31, 2014,
 23 28 to conduct a comprehensive review of the program and submit
 23 29 a report with specified information to the governor and the
 23 30 general assembly.
 23 31    The division modifies the purpose of the program to be
 23 32 to provide financial assistance to eligible entrepreneurial
 23 33 assistance providers (provider) that provide technical and
 23 34 financial assistance to entrepreneurs and start=up companies
 23 35 seeking to create, locate, or expand a business in Iowa.
 24  1 "Financial assistance" is defined in the division.
 24  2    The division changes the requirements for receiving an
 24  3 award.  To be eligible to receive an award under current
 24  4 law, an entrepreneurial assistance program must have been
 24  5 an Iowa=based business, expended at least $500,000 during
 24  6 the previous fiscal year to provide technical and financial
 24  7 assistance services that meet the broad=based needs of

 24  9 in Iowa that intends to derive more than 10 percent of its
 24 10 gross sales from markets outside Iowa; and must have engaged
 24 11 and communicated with certain other programs, funding sources,
 24 12 and entities for its entrepreneur clients.  The division
 24 13 amends the eligibility for receiving financial assistance to
 24 14 require that a provider have its principal place of operations
 24 15 in Iowa and that the provider offer a comprehensive set of
 24 16 business development services to emerging and early=stage
 24 17 innovation companies to assist in the creation, location,
 24 18 growth, and long=term success of the company in Iowa.
 24 19 "Business development services" is defined in the division.
 24 20 Business development services may be performed at the physical
 24 21 location of the provider or the company and may be provided in
 24 22 consideration of equity participation in the company, a fee for
 24 23 services, or a membership agreement with the company.
 24 24    Under current law, the EDA board could approve, deny, or
 24 25 defer each application for a grant, and was required to award
 24 26 grants on a first=come, first=served basis.  The division
 24 27 specifies that the EDA board has the discretion to approve,
 24 28 deny, or defer each application for financial assistance and
 24 29 that the amount of financial assistance awarded to a provider
 24 30 is within the discretion of the EDA.  The division requires
 24 31 the EDA to award financial assistance on a competitive basis
 24 32 and allows the EDA to develop scoring criteria and establish
 24 33 minimum requirements for the receipt of a financial assistance
 24 34 award.
 24 35    In addition to the four factors relating to the provider's
 25  1 professional staff that the EDA may consider under current
 25  2 law in deciding whether to award financial assistance, the
 25  3 division provides that the EDA may also consider the service
 25  4 model and likelihood of success of the provider, the provider's
 25  5 similarity to other successful providers in the country, and
 25  6 the provider's financial need.
 25  7    The division modifies the maximum award amount for a
 25  8 recipient.  Under current law, a grant to an entrepreneur
 25  9 assistance program cannot exceed the lesser of 25 percent of
 25 10 the funds expended by the program during the previous fiscal
 25 11 year, 100 percent of the funds raised from certain persons
 25 12 by the program during the previous fiscal year, or $200,000.
 25 13 The division provides that the amount of financial assistance
 25 14 awarded to any one provider shall not exceed $200,000.
 25 15    The division modifies the permitted use of funds received
 25 16 under the program.  Under current law, grants are only
 25 17 permitted to be used for the purpose of operating costs
 25 18 incurred by the program.  The division specifies that financial
 25 19 assistance awarded to a provider shall only be used for
 25 20 the purpose of operating costs incurred by the provider in
 25 21 the provision of business development services to emerging
 25 22 and early=stage innovation companies in Iowa.  The division
 25 23 further requires that such financial assistance shall not be
 25 24 distributed to owners or investors of the company to which the
 25 25 business development services are being provided and shall not
 25 26 be provided to other persons assisting with the provision of
 25 27 the services.
 25 28    Under current law, an entrepreneurial assistance provider is
 25 29 required to accept client referrals from the EDA as a condition
 25 30 of receiving a grant.  The division provides that the EDA may
 25 31 make client referrals to eligible providers.
 25 32    DIVISION IV ==== MISCELLANEOUS CHANGES.  Division IV makes
 25 33 several miscellaneous changes to other EDA programs.  The
 25 34 division amends the sales and use tax refund available under

 26  4 product for the preceding 90=day period at the manufacturing
 26  5 facility operated by the eligible business is at least 50
 26  6 percent of the initial design capacity of the facility.  The
 26  7 division amends the definition of "project completion" to mean
 26  8 the date on which the EDA notifies the department of revenue
 26  9 that all applicable requirements of a workforce housing tax
 26 10 incentive program agreement are satisfied.  This provision
 26 11 takes effect upon enactment and applies retroactively to July
 26 12 1, 2014, for all workforce housing tax incentive agreements
 26 13 entered into on or after that date.
 26 14    The division allows the EDA to extend the project
 26 15 completion date for a project awarded tax incentives under the
 26 16 redevelopment tax credit program and the housing enterprise
 26 17 zone tax incentives program if the property that is the subject
 26 18 of the project suffered a catastrophic fire during the 2014

 24 18 growth, and long=term success of the company in Iowa.
 24 19 "Business development services" is defined in the division.
 24 20 Business development services may be performed at the physical
 24 21 location of the provider or the company and may be provided in
 24 22 consideration of equity participation in the company, a fee for
 24 23 services, or a membership agreement with the company.
 24 24    Under current law, the EDA board could approve, deny, or
 24 25 defer each application for a grant, and was required to award
 24 26 grants on a first=come, first=served basis.  The division
 24 27 specifies that the EDA board has the discretion to approve,
 24 28 deny, or defer each application for financial assistance and
 24 29 that the amount of financial assistance awarded to a provider
 24 30 is within the discretion of the EDA.  The division requires
 24 31 the EDA to award financial assistance on a competitive basis
 24 32 and allows the EDA to develop scoring criteria and establish
 24 33 minimum requirements for the receipt of a financial assistance
 24 34 award.
 24 35    In addition to the four factors relating to the provider's
 25  1 professional staff that the EDA may consider under current
 25  2 law in deciding whether to award financial assistance, the
 25  3 division provides that the EDA may also consider the service
 25  4 model and likelihood of success of the provider, the provider's
 25  5 similarity to other successful providers in the country, and
 25  6 the provider's financial need.
 25  7    The division modifies the maximum award amount for a
 25  8 recipient.  Under current law, a grant to an entrepreneur
 25  9 assistance program cannot exceed the lesser of 25 percent of
 25 10 the funds expended by the program during the previous fiscal
 25 11 year, 100 percent of the funds raised from certain persons
 25 12 by the program during the previous fiscal year, or $200,000.
 25 13 The division provides that the amount of financial assistance
 25 14 awarded to any one provider shall not exceed $200,000.
 25 15    The division modifies the permitted use of funds received
 25 16 under the program.  Under current law, grants are only
 25 17 permitted to be used for the purpose of operating costs
 25 18 incurred by the program.  The division specifies that financial
 25 19 assistance awarded to a provider shall only be used for
 25 20 the purpose of operating costs incurred by the provider in
 25 21 the provision of business development services to emerging
 25 22 and early=stage innovation companies in Iowa.  The division
 25 23 further requires that such financial assistance shall not be
 25 24 distributed to owners or investors of the company to which the
 25 25 business development services are being provided and shall not
 25 26 be provided to other persons assisting with the provision of
 25 27 the services.
 25 28    Under current law, an entrepreneurial assistance provider is
 25 29 required to accept client referrals from the EDA as a condition
 25 30 of receiving a grant.  The division provides that the EDA may
 25 31 make client referrals to eligible providers.
 25 32    DIVISION IV ==== MISCELLANEOUS CHANGES.  Division IV makes
 25 33 several miscellaneous changes to other EDA programs.  The
 25 34 division amends the sales and use tax refund available under
 25 35 the workforce housing tax incentive program.  That refund
 26  1 is available for sales and use tax paid prior to project
 26  2 completion, which is currently defined to mean the first date
 26  3 upon which the average annualized production of finished
 26  4 product for the preceding 90=day period at the manufacturing
 26  5 facility operated by the eligible business is at least 50
 26  6 percent of the initial design capacity of the facility.  The
 26  7 division amends the definition of "project completion" to mean
 26  8 the date on which the EDA notifies the department of revenue
 26  9 that all applicable requirements of a workforce housing tax
 26 10 incentive program agreement are satisfied.  This provision
 26 11 takes effect upon enactment and applies retroactively to July
 26 12 1, 2014, for all workforce housing tax incentive agreements
 26 13 entered into on or after that date.
 26 14    The division allows the EDA to extend the project
 26 15 completion date for a project awarded tax incentives under the
 26 16 redevelopment tax credit program and the housing enterprise
 26 17 zone tax incentives program if the property that is the subject
 26 18 of the project suffered a catastrophic fire during the 2014
 26 19 calendar year.

 20 35 information under the program.  The identity of a tax credit
 21  1 recipient and the amount of the tax credit shall be considered
 21  2 public information under Code chapter 22 (examination of public
 21  3 records), but any other information or record in the possession
 21  4 of the EDA with respect to the program shall be presumed by
 21  5 the EDA to be a trade secret protected under Code chapter 550
 21  6 or common law and shall be kept confidential by the EDA unless
 21  7 otherwise ordered by a court.
 21  8    The division takes effect upon enactment and applies to
 21  9 renewable chemicals produced in Iowa from biomass feedstock on
 21 10 or after that date.  The division applies retroactively to tax
 21 11 years beginning on or after January 1, 2015.
 21 12    DIVISION II ==== ANGEL INVESTOR TAX CREDITS.   Division II
 21 13 makes several changes to the tax credit for investments in
 21 14 qualifying businesses and community=based seed capital funds,
 21 15 often referred to as the angel investor tax credits.  The
 21 16 division amends the purpose of the tax credit in Code section
 21 17 15E.41.  The division excludes investments in community=based
 21 18 seed capital funds from qualifying for the tax credit and
 21 19 makes several conforming amendments to remove references to
 21 20 community=based seed capital funds from the Code.
 21 21    The division modifies the amount and dollar limitation of
 21 22 the tax credit for a taxpayer.  The tax credit is increased
 21 23 from 20 percent to 25 percent of a taxpayer's equity investment
 21 24 in a qualifying business.  Under current law, a taxpayer cannot
 21 25 claim more than $50,000 of tax credit per investment in a
 21 26 qualifying business, and for each tax year a taxpayer and the
 21 27 taxpayer's affiliates cannot claim tax credits for more than
 21 28 five investments in five different qualifying businesses.  The
 21 29 division amends this dollar limitation to prohibit a natural
 21 30 person and the person's spouse, child, or sibling from claiming
 21 31 a combined amount of more than $100,000 in tax credits per tax
 21 32 year.
 21 33    The division also provides that no more than $500,000 in tax
 21 34 credits may be issued per tax year for equity investments in
 21 35 any one qualifying business.
 22  1 The division modifies the procedures for claiming the tax
 22  2 credit.  Under current law, the tax credit is not refundable
 22  3 but available for carryforward for up to five tax years.  The
 22  4 division makes the tax credit refundable for an investment
 22  5 made by a natural person, and for any other person reduces the
 22  6 carryforward period to three years.
 22  7    The division strikes a provision permitting the EDA
 22  8 to cooperate with small business development centers to
 22  9 disseminate information regarding the credits and to develop
 22 10 standard application forms, and requiring the EDA to distribute
 22 11 copies of the application forms to all community=based seed
 22 12 capital funds and potential individual investors.
 22 13    The division modifies the eligibility requirements for
 22 14 qualifying businesses.  The division strikes the requirement
 22 15 that a business have an owner that meets at least one of
 22 16 four qualifications relating to business education or
 22 17 business experience.  The division requires that a business
 22 18 be participating in an entrepreneurial assistance program,
 22 19 as defined in the division, but allows the EDA to waive this
 22 20 requirement if the business establishes that its owners,
 22 21 directors, officers, and employees have an appropriate level
 22 22 of experience such that an entrepreneurial assistance program
 22 23 would not materially change the prospects of the business.
 22 24 The EDA is allowed to consult with outside service providers
 22 25 in considering such a waiver.  The division increases from $5
 22 26 million to $10 million the maximum amount of net worth that
 22 27 a business may have to be considered a qualifying business.
 22 28 The division increases from $250,000 to $500,000 the amount of
 22 29 financing that a business must have in order to be considered a
 22 30 qualifying business, removes "near equity" from the types of
 22 31 financing that will be considered in that calculation, requires
 22 32 that the financing be secured at the time of application for
 22 33 the tax credits, and requires that the business have at least
 22 34 two investors at the time of application for the tax credits.
 22 35 These modified eligibility requirements apply to businesses
 23  1 that submit an application to the EDA to be registered as a
 23  2 qualifying business on or after the effective date of this
 23  3 division of the bill, and businesses that submitted such an
 23  4 application to the EDA before the effective date of this
 23  5 division of the bill shall be governed by current law.
 23  6    The division provides for the confidentiality of certain
 23  7 information with regard to the tax credit.  The identity of
 23  8 a qualifying business, the identity of an investor and the
 23  9 qualifying business in which the investor made an equity
 23 10 investment, and the total number and amount of tax credits
 23 11 issued shall be considered public information under Code
 23 12 chapter 22 (examination of public records), but any other
 23 13 information or record in the possession of the EDA with respect
 23 14 to the program shall be presumed by the EDA to be a trade secret
 23 15 protected under Code chapter 550 or common law and shall be
 23 16 kept confidential by the EDA unless otherwise ordered by a
 23 17 court.
 23 18    The division takes effect upon enactment and applies to
 23 19 equity investments in a qualifying business made on or after
 23 20 that date.  Equity investments in a qualifying business or
 23 21 community=based seed capital fund made prior to the effective
 23 22 date of the division shall be governed by current law.
 23 23    DIVISION III ==== ENTREPRENEUR INVESTMENT AWARDS PROGRAM.
 23 24  Division III amends the entrepreneur investment awards program
 23 25 administered by the EDA.  The division strikes provisions that
 23 26 prohibited the EDA from making awards under the program since
 23 27 July 1, 2014, and that required the EDA by December 31, 2014,
 23 28 to conduct a comprehensive review of the program and submit
 23 29 a report with specified information to the governor and the
 23 30 general assembly.
 23 31    The division modifies the purpose of the program to be
 23 32 to provide financial assistance to eligible entrepreneurial
 23 33 assistance providers (provider) that provide technical and
 23 34 financial assistance to entrepreneurs and start=up companies
 23 35 seeking to create, locate, or expand a business in Iowa.
 24  1 "Financial assistance" is defined in the division.
 24  2    The division changes the requirements for receiving an
 24  3 award.  To be eligible to receive an award under current
 24  4 law, an entrepreneurial assistance program must have been
 24  5 an Iowa=based business, expended at least $500,000 during
 24  6 the previous fiscal year to provide technical and financial
 24  7 assistance services that meet the broad=based needs of
 24  8 entrepreneurs seeking to create, locate, or expand a business
 24  9 in Iowa that intends to derive more than 10 percent of its
 24 10 gross sales from markets outside Iowa; and must have engaged
 24 11 and communicated with certain other programs, funding sources,
 24 12 and entities for its entrepreneur clients.  The division
 24 13 amends the eligibility for receiving financial assistance to
 24 14 require that a provider have its principal place of operations
 24 15 in Iowa and that the provider offer a comprehensive set of
 24 16 business development services to emerging and early=stage
 24 17 innovation companies to assist in the creation, location,
 24 18 growth, and long=term success of the company in Iowa.
 24 19 "Business development services" is defined in the division.
 24 20 Business development services may be performed at the physical
 24 21 location of the provider or the company and may be provided in
 24 22 consideration of equity participation in the company, a fee for
 24 23 services, or a membership agreement with the company.
 24 24    Under current law, the EDA board could approve, deny, or
 24 25 defer each application for a grant, and was required to award
 24 26 grants on a first=come, first=served basis.  The division
 24 27 specifies that the EDA board has the discretion to approve,
 24 28 deny, or defer each application for financial assistance and
 24 29 that the amount of financial assistance awarded to a provider
 24 30 is within the discretion of the EDA.  The division requires
 24 31 the EDA to award financial assistance on a competitive basis
 24 32 and allows the EDA to develop scoring criteria and establish
 24 33 minimum requirements for the receipt of a financial assistance
 24 34 award.
 24 35    In addition to the four factors relating to the provider's
 25  1 professional staff that the EDA may consider under current
 25  2 law in deciding whether to award financial assistance, the
 25  3 division provides that the EDA may also consider the service
 25  4 model and likelihood of success of the provider, the provider's
 25  5 similarity to other successful providers in the country, and
 25  6 the provider's financial need.
 25  7    The division modifies the maximum award amount for a
 25  8 recipient.  Under current law, a grant to an entrepreneur
 25  9 assistance program cannot exceed the lesser of 25 percent of
 25 10 the funds expended by the program during the previous fiscal
 25 11 year, 100 percent of the funds raised from certain persons
 25 12 by the program during the previous fiscal year, or $200,000.
 25 13 The division provides that the amount of financial assistance
 25 14 awarded to any one provider shall not exceed $200,000.
 25 15    The division modifies the permitted use of funds received
 25 16 under the program.  Under current law, grants are only
 25 17 permitted to be used for the purpose of operating costs
 25 18 incurred by the program.  The division specifies that financial
 25 19 assistance awarded to a provider shall only be used for
 25 20 the purpose of operating costs incurred by the provider in
 25 21 the provision of business development services to emerging
 25 22 and early=stage innovation companies in Iowa.  The division
 25 23 further requires that such financial assistance shall not be
 25 24 distributed to owners or investors of the company to which the
 25 25 business development services are being provided and shall not
 25 26 be provided to other persons assisting with the provision of
 25 27 the services.
 25 28    Under current law, an entrepreneurial assistance provider is
 25 29 required to accept client referrals from the EDA as a condition
 25 30 of receiving a grant.  The division provides that the EDA may
 25 31 make client referrals to eligible providers.
 25 32    DIVISION IV ==== MISCELLANEOUS CHANGES.  Division IV makes
 25 33 several miscellaneous changes to other EDA programs.  The
 25 34 division amends the sales and use tax refund available under
 25 35 the workforce housing tax incentive program.  That refund
 26  1 is available for sales and use tax paid prior to project
 26  2 completion, which is currently defined to mean the first date
 26  3 upon which the average annualized production of finished

 26  5 facility operated by the eligible business is at least 50
 26  6 percent of the initial design capacity of the facility.  The
 26  7 division amends the definition of "project completion" to mean
 26  8 the date on which the EDA notifies the department of revenue
 26  9 that all applicable requirements of a workforce housing tax
 26 10 incentive program agreement are satisfied.  This provision
 26 11 takes effect upon enactment and applies retroactively to July

 23 23    DIVISION III ==== ENTREPRENEUR INVESTMENT AWARDS PROGRAM.
 23 24  Division III amends the entrepreneur investment awards program
 23 25 administered by the EDA.  The division strikes provisions that

 24 24    Under current law, the EDA board could approve, deny, or
 24 25 defer each application for a grant, and was required to award
 24 26 grants on a first=come, first=served basis.  The division

 24 30 is within the discretion of the EDA.  The division requires
 24 31 the EDA to award financial assistance on a competitive basis

 24 35    In addition to the four factors relating to the provider's
 25  1 professional staff that the EDA may consider under current
 25  2 law in deciding whether to award financial assistance, the
 25  3 division provides that the EDA may also consider the service
 25  4 model and likelihood of success of the provider, the provider's
 25  5 similarity to other successful providers in the country, and
 25  6 the provider's financial need.
 25  7    The division modifies the maximum award amount for a

 25  9 assistance program cannot exceed the lesser of 25 percent of
 25 10 the funds expended by the program during the previous fiscal
 25 11 year, 100 percent of the funds raised from certain persons

 25 13 The division provides that the amount of financial assistance
 25 14 awarded to any one provider shall not exceed $200,000.
 25 15    The division modifies the permitted use of funds received
 25 16 under the program.  Under current law, grants are only
 25 17 permitted to be used for the purpose of operating costs
 25 18 incurred by the program.  The division specifies that financial
 25 19 assistance awarded to a provider shall only be used for
 25 20 the purpose of operating costs incurred by the provider in
 25 21 the provision of business development services to emerging
 25 22 and early=stage innovation companies in Iowa.  The division
 25 23 further requires that such financial assistance shall not be
 25 24 distributed to owners or investors of the company to which the
 25 25 business development services are being provided and shall not
 25 26 be provided to other persons assisting with the provision of
 25 27 the services.
 25 28    Under current law, an entrepreneurial assistance provider is
 25 29 required to accept client referrals from the EDA as a condition
 25 30 of receiving a grant.  The division provides that the EDA may
 25 31 make client referrals to eligible providers.
 25 32    DIVISION IV ==== MISCELLANEOUS CHANGES.  Division IV makes
 25 33 several miscellaneous changes to other EDA programs.  The
 25 34 division amends the sales and use tax refund available under
 25 35 the workforce housing tax incentive program.  That refund
 26  1 is available for sales and use tax paid prior to project
 26  2 completion, which is currently defined to mean the first date
 26  3 upon which the average annualized production of finished
 26  4 product for the preceding 90=day period at the manufacturing
 26  5 facility operated by the eligible business is at least 50
 26  6 percent of the initial design capacity of the facility.  The
 26  7 division amends the definition of "project completion" to mean
 26  8 the date on which the EDA notifies the department of revenue
 26  9 that all applicable requirements of a workforce housing tax
 26 10 incentive program agreement are satisfied.  This provision
 26 11 takes effect upon enactment and applies retroactively to July
 26 12 1, 2014, for all workforce housing tax incentive agreements
 26 13 entered into on or after that date.
 26 14    The division allows the EDA to extend the project
 26 15 completion date for a project awarded tax incentives under the
 26 16 redevelopment tax credit program and the housing enterprise
 26 17 zone tax incentives program if the property that is the subject
 26 18 of the project suffered a catastrophic fire during the 2014
 26 19 calendar year.

 21  5 the EDA to be a trade secret protected under Code chapter 550
 21  6 or common law and shall be kept confidential by the EDA unless
 21  7 otherwise ordered by a court.
 21  8    The division takes effect upon enactment and applies to
 21  9 renewable chemicals produced in Iowa from biomass feedstock on
 21 10 or after that date.  The division applies retroactively to tax
 21 11 years beginning on or after January 1, 2015.
 21 12    DIVISION II ==== ANGEL INVESTOR TAX CREDITS.   Division II
 21 13 makes several changes to the tax credit for investments in
 21 14 qualifying businesses and community=based seed capital funds,
 21 15 often referred to as the angel investor tax credits.  The
 21 16 division amends the purpose of the tax credit in Code section
 21 17 15E.41.  The division excludes investments in community=based
 21 18 seed capital funds from qualifying for the tax credit and
 21 19 makes several conforming amendments to remove references to
 21 20 community=based seed capital funds from the Code.
 21 21    The division modifies the amount and dollar limitation of
 21 22 the tax credit for a taxpayer.  The tax credit is increased
 21 23 from 20 percent to 25 percent of a taxpayer's equity investment
 21 24 in a qualifying business.  Under current law, a taxpayer cannot
 21 25 claim more than $50,000 of tax credit per investment in a
 21 26 qualifying business, and for each tax year a taxpayer and the
 21 27 taxpayer's affiliates cannot claim tax credits for more than
 21 28 five investments in five different qualifying businesses.  The
 21 29 division amends this dollar limitation to prohibit a natural
 21 30 person and the person's spouse, child, or sibling from claiming
 21 31 a combined amount of more than $100,000 in tax credits per tax
 21 32 year.
 21 33    The division also provides that no more than $500,000 in tax
 21 34 credits may be issued per tax year for equity investments in
 21 35 any one qualifying business.
 22  1 The division modifies the procedures for claiming the tax
 22  2 credit.  Under current law, the tax credit is not refundable
 22  3 but available for carryforward for up to five tax years.  The
 22  4 division makes the tax credit refundable for an investment
 22  5 made by a natural person, and for any other person reduces the
 22  6 carryforward period to three years.
 22  7    The division strikes a provision permitting the EDA
 22  8 to cooperate with small business development centers to
 22  9 disseminate information regarding the credits and to develop
 22 10 standard application forms, and requiring the EDA to distribute
 22 11 copies of the application forms to all community=based seed
 22 12 capital funds and potential individual investors.
 22 13    The division modifies the eligibility requirements for
 22 14 qualifying businesses.  The division strikes the requirement
 22 15 that a business have an owner that meets at least one of
 22 16 four qualifications relating to business education or
 22 17 business experience.  The division requires that a business
 22 18 be participating in an entrepreneurial assistance program,
 22 19 as defined in the division, but allows the EDA to waive this
 22 20 requirement if the business establishes that its owners,
 22 21 directors, officers, and employees have an appropriate level
 22 22 of experience such that an entrepreneurial assistance program
 22 23 would not materially change the prospects of the business.
 22 24 The EDA is allowed to consult with outside service providers
 22 25 in considering such a waiver.  The division increases from $5
 22 26 million to $10 million the maximum amount of net worth that
 22 27 a business may have to be considered a qualifying business.
 22 28 The division increases from $250,000 to $500,000 the amount of
 22 29 financing that a business must have in order to be considered a
 22 30 qualifying business, removes "near equity" from the types of
 22 31 financing that will be considered in that calculation, requires
 22 32 that the financing be secured at the time of application for
 22 33 the tax credits, and requires that the business have at least
 22 34 two investors at the time of application for the tax credits.
 22 35 These modified eligibility requirements apply to businesses
 23  1 that submit an application to the EDA to be registered as a
 23  2 qualifying business on or after the effective date of this
 23  3 division of the bill, and businesses that submitted such an
 23  4 application to the EDA before the effective date of this
 23  5 division of the bill shall be governed by current law.
 23  6    The division provides for the confidentiality of certain
 23  7 information with regard to the tax credit.  The identity of
 23  8 a qualifying business, the identity of an investor and the
 23  9 qualifying business in which the investor made an equity
 23 10 investment, and the total number and amount of tax credits
 23 11 issued shall be considered public information under Code
 23 12 chapter 22 (examination of public records), but any other
 23 13 information or record in the possession of the EDA with respect
 23 14 to the program shall be presumed by the EDA to be a trade secret
 23 15 protected under Code chapter 550 or common law and shall be
 23 16 kept confidential by the EDA unless otherwise ordered by a
 23 17 court.
 23 18    The division takes effect upon enactment and applies to
 23 19 equity investments in a qualifying business made on or after
 23 20 that date.  Equity investments in a qualifying business or
 23 21 community=based seed capital fund made prior to the effective
 23 22 date of the division shall be governed by current law.
 23 23    DIVISION III ==== ENTREPRENEUR INVESTMENT AWARDS PROGRAM.
 23 24  Division III amends the entrepreneur investment awards program
 23 25 administered by the EDA.  The division strikes provisions that
 23 26 prohibited the EDA from making awards under the program since
 23 27 July 1, 2014, and that required the EDA by December 31, 2014,
 23 28 to conduct a comprehensive review of the program and submit
 23 29 a report with specified information to the governor and the
 23 30 general assembly.
 23 31    The division modifies the purpose of the program to be
 23 32 to provide financial assistance to eligible entrepreneurial
 23 33 assistance providers (provider) that provide technical and
 23 34 financial assistance to entrepreneurs and start=up companies
 23 35 seeking to create, locate, or expand a business in Iowa.
 24  1 "Financial assistance" is defined in the division.
 24  2    The division changes the requirements for receiving an
 24  3 award.  To be eligible to receive an award under current
 24  4 law, an entrepreneurial assistance program must have been
 24  5 an Iowa=based business, expended at least $500,000 during
 24  6 the previous fiscal year to provide technical and financial
 24  7 assistance services that meet the broad=based needs of
 24  8 entrepreneurs seeking to create, locate, or expand a business
 24  9 in Iowa that intends to derive more than 10 percent of its
 24 10 gross sales from markets outside Iowa; and must have engaged
 24 11 and communicated with certain other programs, funding sources,
 24 12 and entities for its entrepreneur clients.  The division
 24 13 amends the eligibility for receiving financial assistance to
 24 14 require that a provider have its principal place of operations
 24 15 in Iowa and that the provider offer a comprehensive set of
 24 16 business development services to emerging and early=stage
 24 17 innovation companies to assist in the creation, location,
 24 18 growth, and long=term success of the company in Iowa.
 24 19 "Business development services" is defined in the division.
 24 20 Business development services may be performed at the physical
 24 21 location of the provider or the company and may be provided in
 24 22 consideration of equity participation in the company, a fee for
 24 23 services, or a membership agreement with the company.
 24 24    Under current law, the EDA board could approve, deny, or
 24 25 defer each application for a grant, and was required to award
 24 26 grants on a first=come, first=served basis.  The division
 24 27 specifies that the EDA board has the discretion to approve,
 24 28 deny, or defer each application for financial assistance and
 24 29 that the amount of financial assistance awarded to a provider
 24 30 is within the discretion of the EDA.  The division requires
 24 31 the EDA to award financial assistance on a competitive basis
 24 32 and allows the EDA to develop scoring criteria and establish
 24 33 minimum requirements for the receipt of a financial assistance
 24 34 award.
 24 35    In addition to the four factors relating to the provider's
 25  1 professional staff that the EDA may consider under current
 25  2 law in deciding whether to award financial assistance, the
 25  3 division provides that the EDA may also consider the service
 25  4 model and likelihood of success of the provider, the provider's
 25  5 similarity to other successful providers in the country, and
 25  6 the provider's financial need.
 25  7    The division modifies the maximum award amount for a
 25  8 recipient.  Under current law, a grant to an entrepreneur
 25  9 assistance program cannot exceed the lesser of 25 percent of
 25 10 the funds expended by the program during the previous fiscal
 25 11 year, 100 percent of the funds raised from certain persons
 25 12 by the program during the previous fiscal year, or $200,000.
 25 13 The division provides that the amount of financial assistance
 25 14 awarded to any one provider shall not exceed $200,000.
 25 15    The division modifies the permitted use of funds received
 25 16 under the program.  Under current law, grants are only
 25 17 permitted to be used for the purpose of operating costs
 25 18 incurred by the program.  The division specifies that financial
 25 19 assistance awarded to a provider shall only be used for
 25 20 the purpose of operating costs incurred by the provider in
 25 21 the provision of business development services to emerging
 25 22 and early=stage innovation companies in Iowa.  The division
 25 23 further requires that such financial assistance shall not be
 25 24 distributed to owners or investors of the company to which the
 25 25 business development services are being provided and shall not
 25 26 be provided to other persons assisting with the provision of
 25 27 the services.
 25 28    Under current law, an entrepreneurial assistance provider is
 25 29 required to accept client referrals from the EDA as a condition
 25 30 of receiving a grant.  The division provides that the EDA may
 25 31 make client referrals to eligible providers.
 25 32    DIVISION IV ==== MISCELLANEOUS CHANGES.  Division IV makes
 25 33 several miscellaneous changes to other EDA programs.  The
 25 34 division amends the sales and use tax refund available under
 25 35 the workforce housing tax incentive program.  That refund
 26  1 is available for sales and use tax paid prior to project
 26  2 completion, which is currently defined to mean the first date
 26  3 upon which the average annualized production of finished
 26  4 product for the preceding 90=day period at the manufacturing
 26  5 facility operated by the eligible business is at least 50
 26  6 percent of the initial design capacity of the facility.  The
 26  7 division amends the definition of "project completion" to mean
 26  8 the date on which the EDA notifies the department of revenue
 26  9 that all applicable requirements of a workforce housing tax
 26 10 incentive program agreement are satisfied.  This provision
 26 11 takes effect upon enactment and applies retroactively to July
 26 12 1, 2014, for all workforce housing tax incentive agreements
 26 13 entered into on or after that date.
 26 14    The division allows the EDA to extend the project
 26 15 completion date for a project awarded tax incentives under the
 26 16 redevelopment tax credit program and the housing enterprise
 26 17 zone tax incentives program if the property that is the subject
 26 18 of the project suffered a catastrophic fire during the 2014
 26 19 calendar year.

 21  7 otherwise ordered by a court.
 21  8    The division takes effect upon enactment and applies to
 21  9 renewable chemicals produced in Iowa from biomass feedstock on
 21 10 or after that date.  The division applies retroactively to tax
 21 11 years beginning on or after January 1, 2015.
 21 12    DIVISION II ==== ANGEL INVESTOR TAX CREDITS.   Division II
 21 13 makes several changes to the tax credit for investments in
 21 14 qualifying businesses and community=based seed capital funds,
 21 15 often referred to as the angel investor tax credits.  The
 21 16 division amends the purpose of the tax credit in Code section
 21 17 15E.41.  The division excludes investments in community=based
 21 18 seed capital funds from qualifying for the tax credit and
 21 19 makes several conforming amendments to remove references to
 21 20 community=based seed capital funds from the Code.
 21 21    The division modifies the amount and dollar limitation of
 21 22 the tax credit for a taxpayer.  The tax credit is increased
 21 23 from 20 percent to 25 percent of a taxpayer's equity investment
 21 24 in a qualifying business.  Under current law, a taxpayer cannot
 21 25 claim more than $50,000 of tax credit per investment in a
 21 26 qualifying business, and for each tax year a taxpayer and the
 21 27 taxpayer's affiliates cannot claim tax credits for more than
 21 28 five investments in five different qualifying businesses.  The
 21 29 division amends this dollar limitation to prohibit a natural
 21 30 person and the person's spouse, child, or sibling from claiming
 21 31 a combined amount of more than $100,000 in tax credits per tax
 21 32 year.
 21 33    The division also provides that no more than $500,000 in tax
 21 34 credits may be issued per tax year for equity investments in
 21 35 any one qualifying business.
 22  1 The division modifies the procedures for claiming the tax
 22  2 credit.  Under current law, the tax credit is not refundable
 22  3 but available for carryforward for up to five tax years.  The
 22  4 division makes the tax credit refundable for an investment
 22  5 made by a natural person, and for any other person reduces the
 22  6 carryforward period to three years.
 22  7    The division strikes a provision permitting the EDA
 22  8 to cooperate with small business development centers to
 22  9 disseminate information regarding the credits and to develop
 22 10 standard application forms, and requiring the EDA to distribute
 22 11 copies of the application forms to all community=based seed
 22 12 capital funds and potential individual investors.
 22 13    The division modifies the eligibility requirements for
 22 14 qualifying businesses.  The division strikes the requirement
 22 15 that a business have an owner that meets at least one of
 22 16 four qualifications relating to business education or
 22 17 business experience.  The division requires that a business
 22 18 be participating in an entrepreneurial assistance program,
 22 19 as defined in the division, but allows the EDA to waive this
 22 20 requirement if the business establishes that its owners,
 22 21 directors, officers, and employees have an appropriate level
 22 22 of experience such that an entrepreneurial assistance program
 22 23 would not materially change the prospects of the business.
 22 24 The EDA is allowed to consult with outside service providers
 22 25 in considering such a waiver.  The division increases from $5
 22 26 million to $10 million the maximum amount of net worth that
 22 27 a business may have to be considered a qualifying business.
 22 28 The division increases from $250,000 to $500,000 the amount of
 22 29 financing that a business must have in order to be considered a
 22 30 qualifying business, removes "near equity" from the types of
 22 31 financing that will be considered in that calculation, requires
 22 32 that the financing be secured at the time of application for
 22 33 the tax credits, and requires that the business have at least
 22 34 two investors at the time of application for the tax credits.
 22 35 These modified eligibility requirements apply to businesses
 23  1 that submit an application to the EDA to be registered as a
 23  2 qualifying business on or after the effective date of this
 23  3 division of the bill, and businesses that submitted such an
 23  4 application to the EDA before the effective date of this
 23  5 division of the bill shall be governed by current law.
 23  6    The division provides for the confidentiality of certain
 23  7 information with regard to the tax credit.  The identity of
 23  8 a qualifying business, the identity of an investor and the
 23  9 qualifying business in which the investor made an equity
 23 10 investment, and the total number and amount of tax credits
 23 11 issued shall be considered public information under Code
 23 12 chapter 22 (examination of public records), but any other
 23 13 information or record in the possession of the EDA with respect
 23 14 to the program shall be presumed by the EDA to be a trade secret
 23 15 protected under Code chapter 550 or common law and shall be
 23 16 kept confidential by the EDA unless otherwise ordered by a
 23 17 court.
 23 18    The division takes effect upon enactment and applies to
 23 19 equity investments in a qualifying business made on or after
 23 20 that date.  Equity investments in a qualifying business or
 23 21 community=based seed capital fund made prior to the effective
 23 22 date of the division shall be governed by current law.
 23 23    DIVISION III ==== ENTREPRENEUR INVESTMENT AWARDS PROGRAM.
 23 24  Division III amends the entrepreneur investment awards program
 23 25 administered by the EDA.  The division strikes provisions that
 23 26 prohibited the EDA from making awards under the program since
 23 27 July 1, 2014, and that required the EDA by December 31, 2014,
 23 28 to conduct a comprehensive review of the program and submit
 23 29 a report with specified information to the governor and the

 23 31    The division modifies the purpose of the program to be
 23 32 to provide financial assistance to eligible entrepreneurial
 23 33 assistance providers (provider) that provide technical and
 23 34 financial assistance to entrepreneurs and start=up companies
 23 35 seeking to create, locate, or expand a business in Iowa.
 24  1 "Financial assistance" is defined in the division.
 24  2    The division changes the requirements for receiving an
 24  3 award.  To be eligible to receive an award under current
 24  4 law, an entrepreneurial assistance program must have been
 24  5 an Iowa=based business, expended at least $500,000 during
 24  6 the previous fiscal year to provide technical and financial

 24 10 gross sales from markets outside Iowa; and must have engaged
 24 11 and communicated with certain other programs, funding sources,

 24 15 in Iowa and that the provider offer a comprehensive set of
 24 16 business development services to emerging and early=stage
 24 17 innovation companies to assist in the creation, location,
 24 18 growth, and long=term success of the company in Iowa.
 24 19 "Business development services" is defined in the division.
 24 20 Business development services may be performed at the physical
 24 21 location of the provider or the company and may be provided in
 24 22 consideration of equity participation in the company, a fee for
 24 23 services, or a membership agreement with the company.
 24 24    Under current law, the EDA board could approve, deny, or
 24 25 defer each application for a grant, and was required to award
 24 26 grants on a first=come, first=served basis.  The division
 24 27 specifies that the EDA board has the discretion to approve,
 24 28 deny, or defer each application for financial assistance and
 24 29 that the amount of financial assistance awarded to a provider
 24 30 is within the discretion of the EDA.  The division requires
 24 31 the EDA to award financial assistance on a competitive basis
 24 32 and allows the EDA to develop scoring criteria and establish
 24 33 minimum requirements for the receipt of a financial assistance
 24 34 award.
 24 35    In addition to the four factors relating to the provider's

 25  2 law in deciding whether to award financial assistance, the
 25  3 division provides that the EDA may also consider the service
 25  4 model and likelihood of success of the provider, the provider's
 25  5 similarity to other successful providers in the country, and
 25  6 the provider's financial need.
 25  7    The division modifies the maximum award amount for a
 25  8 recipient.  Under current law, a grant to an entrepreneur
 25  9 assistance program cannot exceed the lesser of 25 percent of
 25 10 the funds expended by the program during the previous fiscal
 25 11 year, 100 percent of the funds raised from certain persons
 25 12 by the program during the previous fiscal year, or $200,000.
 25 13 The division provides that the amount of financial assistance
 25 14 awarded to any one provider shall not exceed $200,000.
 25 15    The division modifies the permitted use of funds received
 25 16 under the program.  Under current law, grants are only
 25 17 permitted to be used for the purpose of operating costs
 25 18 incurred by the program.  The division specifies that financial
 25 19 assistance awarded to a provider shall only be used for
 25 20 the purpose of operating costs incurred by the provider in
 25 21 the provision of business development services to emerging
 25 22 and early=stage innovation companies in Iowa.  The division
 25 23 further requires that such financial assistance shall not be
 25 24 distributed to owners or investors of the company to which the
 25 25 business development services are being provided and shall not
 25 26 be provided to other persons assisting with the provision of
 25 27 the services.
 25 28    Under current law, an entrepreneurial assistance provider is
 25 29 required to accept client referrals from the EDA as a condition
 25 30 of receiving a grant.  The division provides that the EDA may
 25 31 make client referrals to eligible providers.
 25 32    DIVISION IV ==== MISCELLANEOUS CHANGES.  Division IV makes
 25 33 several miscellaneous changes to other EDA programs.  The
 25 34 division amends the sales and use tax refund available under
 25 35 the workforce housing tax incentive program.  That refund
 26  1 is available for sales and use tax paid prior to project
 26  2 completion, which is currently defined to mean the first date
 26  3 upon which the average annualized production of finished
 26  4 product for the preceding 90=day period at the manufacturing
 26  5 facility operated by the eligible business is at least 50
 26  6 percent of the initial design capacity of the facility.  The
 26  7 division amends the definition of "project completion" to mean
 26  8 the date on which the EDA notifies the department of revenue
 26  9 that all applicable requirements of a workforce housing tax
 26 10 incentive program agreement are satisfied.  This provision
 26 11 takes effect upon enactment and applies retroactively to July
 26 12 1, 2014, for all workforce housing tax incentive agreements
 26 13 entered into on or after that date.
 26 14    The division allows the EDA to extend the project
 26 15 completion date for a project awarded tax incentives under the
 26 16 redevelopment tax credit program and the housing enterprise
 26 17 zone tax incentives program if the property that is the subject
 26 18 of the project suffered a catastrophic fire during the 2014

 21  8    The division takes effect upon enactment and applies to
 21  9 renewable chemicals produced in Iowa from biomass feedstock on
 21 10 or after that date.  The division applies retroactively to tax
 21 11 years beginning on or after January 1, 2015.
 21 12    DIVISION II ==== ANGEL INVESTOR TAX CREDITS.   Division II
 21 13 makes several changes to the tax credit for investments in
 21 14 qualifying businesses and community=based seed capital funds,
 21 15 often referred to as the angel investor tax credits.  The
 21 16 division amends the purpose of the tax credit in Code section
 21 17 15E.41.  The division excludes investments in community=based
 21 18 seed capital funds from qualifying for the tax credit and
 21 19 makes several conforming amendments to remove references to
 21 20 community=based seed capital funds from the Code.
 21 21    The division modifies the amount and dollar limitation of
 21 22 the tax credit for a taxpayer.  The tax credit is increased
 21 23 from 20 percent to 25 percent of a taxpayer's equity investment
 21 24 in a qualifying business.  Under current law, a taxpayer cannot
 21 25 claim more than $50,000 of tax credit per investment in a
 21 26 qualifying business, and for each tax year a taxpayer and the
 21 27 taxpayer's affiliates cannot claim tax credits for more than
 21 28 five investments in five different qualifying businesses.  The
 21 29 division amends this dollar limitation to prohibit a natural
 21 30 person and the person's spouse, child, or sibling from claiming
 21 31 a combined amount of more than $100,000 in tax credits per tax
 21 32 year.
 21 33    The division also provides that no more than $500,000 in tax
 21 34 credits may be issued per tax year for equity investments in
 21 35 any one qualifying business.
 22  1 The division modifies the procedures for claiming the tax
 22  2 credit.  Under current law, the tax credit is not refundable
 22  3 but available for carryforward for up to five tax years.  The
 22  4 division makes the tax credit refundable for an investment
 22  5 made by a natural person, and for any other person reduces the
 22  6 carryforward period to three years.
 22  7    The division strikes a provision permitting the EDA
 22  8 to cooperate with small business development centers to
 22  9 disseminate information regarding the credits and to develop
 22 10 standard application forms, and requiring the EDA to distribute
 22 11 copies of the application forms to all community=based seed
 22 12 capital funds and potential individual investors.
 22 13    The division modifies the eligibility requirements for
 22 14 qualifying businesses.  The division strikes the requirement
 22 15 that a business have an owner that meets at least one of
 22 16 four qualifications relating to business education or
 22 17 business experience.  The division requires that a business
 22 18 be participating in an entrepreneurial assistance program,
 22 19 as defined in the division, but allows the EDA to waive this
 22 20 requirement if the business establishes that its owners,
 22 21 directors, officers, and employees have an appropriate level
 22 22 of experience such that an entrepreneurial assistance program
 22 23 would not materially change the prospects of the business.
 22 24 The EDA is allowed to consult with outside service providers
 22 25 in considering such a waiver.  The division increases from $5
 22 26 million to $10 million the maximum amount of net worth that
 22 27 a business may have to be considered a qualifying business.
 22 28 The division increases from $250,000 to $500,000 the amount of
 22 29 financing that a business must have in order to be considered a
 22 30 qualifying business, removes "near equity" from the types of
 22 31 financing that will be considered in that calculation, requires
 22 32 that the financing be secured at the time of application for
 22 33 the tax credits, and requires that the business have at least
 22 34 two investors at the time of application for the tax credits.
 22 35 These modified eligibility requirements apply to businesses
 23  1 that submit an application to the EDA to be registered as a
 23  2 qualifying business on or after the effective date of this
 23  3 division of the bill, and businesses that submitted such an
 23  4 application to the EDA before the effective date of this
 23  5 division of the bill shall be governed by current law.
 23  6    The division provides for the confidentiality of certain
 23  7 information with regard to the tax credit.  The identity of
 23  8 a qualifying business, the identity of an investor and the
 23  9 qualifying business in which the investor made an equity
 23 10 investment, and the total number and amount of tax credits
 23 11 issued shall be considered public information under Code
 23 12 chapter 22 (examination of public records), but any other
 23 13 information or record in the possession of the EDA with respect
 23 14 to the program shall be presumed by the EDA to be a trade secret
 23 15 protected under Code chapter 550 or common law and shall be
 23 16 kept confidential by the EDA unless otherwise ordered by a
 23 17 court.
 23 18    The division takes effect upon enactment and applies to
 23 19 equity investments in a qualifying business made on or after
 23 20 that date.  Equity investments in a qualifying business or
 23 21 community=based seed capital fund made prior to the effective
 23 22 date of the division shall be governed by current law.
 23 23    DIVISION III ==== ENTREPRENEUR INVESTMENT AWARDS PROGRAM.
 23 24  Division III amends the entrepreneur investment awards program
 23 25 administered by the EDA.  The division strikes provisions that
 23 26 prohibited the EDA from making awards under the program since
 23 27 July 1, 2014, and that required the EDA by December 31, 2014,
 23 28 to conduct a comprehensive review of the program and submit
 23 29 a report with specified information to the governor and the
 23 30 general assembly.
 23 31    The division modifies the purpose of the program to be
 23 32 to provide financial assistance to eligible entrepreneurial
 23 33 assistance providers (provider) that provide technical and
 23 34 financial assistance to entrepreneurs and start=up companies
 23 35 seeking to create, locate, or expand a business in Iowa.
 24  1 "Financial assistance" is defined in the division.
 24  2    The division changes the requirements for receiving an
 24  3 award.  To be eligible to receive an award under current
 24  4 law, an entrepreneurial assistance program must have been
 24  5 an Iowa=based business, expended at least $500,000 during
 24  6 the previous fiscal year to provide technical and financial
 24  7 assistance services that meet the broad=based needs of
 24  8 entrepreneurs seeking to create, locate, or expand a business
 24  9 in Iowa that intends to derive more than 10 percent of its
 24 10 gross sales from markets outside Iowa; and must have engaged
 24 11 and communicated with certain other programs, funding sources,
 24 12 and entities for its entrepreneur clients.  The division
 24 13 amends the eligibility for receiving financial assistance to
 24 14 require that a provider have its principal place of operations
 24 15 in Iowa and that the provider offer a comprehensive set of
 24 16 business development services to emerging and early=stage
 24 17 innovation companies to assist in the creation, location,
 24 18 growth, and long=term success of the company in Iowa.
 24 19 "Business development services" is defined in the division.
 24 20 Business development services may be performed at the physical
 24 21 location of the provider or the company and may be provided in
 24 22 consideration of equity participation in the company, a fee for
 24 23 services, or a membership agreement with the company.
 24 24    Under current law, the EDA board could approve, deny, or
 24 25 defer each application for a grant, and was required to award
 24 26 grants on a first=come, first=served basis.  The division
 24 27 specifies that the EDA board has the discretion to approve,
 24 28 deny, or defer each application for financial assistance and
 24 29 that the amount of financial assistance awarded to a provider
 24 30 is within the discretion of the EDA.  The division requires
 24 31 the EDA to award financial assistance on a competitive basis
 24 32 and allows the EDA to develop scoring criteria and establish
 24 33 minimum requirements for the receipt of a financial assistance
 24 34 award.
 24 35    In addition to the four factors relating to the provider's
 25  1 professional staff that the EDA may consider under current
 25  2 law in deciding whether to award financial assistance, the
 25  3 division provides that the EDA may also consider the service
 25  4 model and likelihood of success of the provider, the provider's
 25  5 similarity to other successful providers in the country, and
 25  6 the provider's financial need.
 25  7    The division modifies the maximum award amount for a
 25  8 recipient.  Under current law, a grant to an entrepreneur
 25  9 assistance program cannot exceed the lesser of 25 percent of
 25 10 the funds expended by the program during the previous fiscal
 25 11 year, 100 percent of the funds raised from certain persons
 25 12 by the program during the previous fiscal year, or $200,000.
 25 13 The division provides that the amount of financial assistance
 25 14 awarded to any one provider shall not exceed $200,000.
 25 15    The division modifies the permitted use of funds received
 25 16 under the program.  Under current law, grants are only
 25 17 permitted to be used for the purpose of operating costs
 25 18 incurred by the program.  The division specifies that financial
 25 19 assistance awarded to a provider shall only be used for
 25 20 the purpose of operating costs incurred by the provider in
 25 21 the provision of business development services to emerging
 25 22 and early=stage innovation companies in Iowa.  The division
 25 23 further requires that such financial assistance shall not be
 25 24 distributed to owners or investors of the company to which the
 25 25 business development services are being provided and shall not
 25 26 be provided to other persons assisting with the provision of
 25 27 the services.
 25 28    Under current law, an entrepreneurial assistance provider is
 25 29 required to accept client referrals from the EDA as a condition
 25 30 of receiving a grant.  The division provides that the EDA may
 25 31 make client referrals to eligible providers.
 25 32    DIVISION IV ==== MISCELLANEOUS CHANGES.  Division IV makes
 25 33 several miscellaneous changes to other EDA programs.  The
 25 34 division amends the sales and use tax refund available under
 25 35 the workforce housing tax incentive program.  That refund
 26  1 is available for sales and use tax paid prior to project
 26  2 completion, which is currently defined to mean the first date
 26  3 upon which the average annualized production of finished
 26  4 product for the preceding 90=day period at the manufacturing
 26  5 facility operated by the eligible business is at least 50
 26  6 percent of the initial design capacity of the facility.  The
 26  7 division amends the definition of "project completion" to mean
 26  8 the date on which the EDA notifies the department of revenue
 26  9 that all applicable requirements of a workforce housing tax
 26 10 incentive program agreement are satisfied.  This provision
 26 11 takes effect upon enactment and applies retroactively to July
 26 12 1, 2014, for all workforce housing tax incentive agreements
 26 13 entered into on or after that date.
 26 14    The division allows the EDA to extend the project
 26 15 completion date for a project awarded tax incentives under the
 26 16 redevelopment tax credit program and the housing enterprise
 26 17 zone tax incentives program if the property that is the subject
 26 18 of the project suffered a catastrophic fire during the 2014
 26 19 calendar year.

 21  5 the EDA to be a trade secret protected under Code chapter 550
 21  6 or common law and shall be kept confidential by the EDA unless
 21  7 otherwise ordered by a court.
 21  8    The division takes effect upon enactment and applies to
 21  9 renewable chemicals produced in Iowa from biomass feedstock on
 21 10 or after that date.  The division applies retroactively to tax
 21 11 years beginning on or after January 1, 2015.
 21 12    DIVISION II ==== ANGEL INVESTOR TAX CREDITS.   Division II
 21 13 makes several changes to the tax credit for investments in
 21 14 qualifying businesses and community=based seed capital funds,
 21 15 often referred to as the angel investor tax credits.  The
 21 16 division amends the purpose of the tax credit in Code section
 21 17 15E.41.  The division excludes investments in community=based
 21 18 seed capital funds from qualifying for the tax credit and
 21 19 makes several conforming amendments to remove references to
 21 20 community=based seed capital funds from the Code.
 21 21    The division modifies the amount and dollar limitation of
 21 22 the tax credit for a taxpayer.  The tax credit is increased
 21 23 from 20 percent to 25 percent of a taxpayer's equity investment
 21 24 in a qualifying business.  Under current law, a taxpayer cannot
 21 25 claim more than $50,000 of tax credit per investment in a
 21 26 qualifying business, and for each tax year a taxpayer and the
 21 27 taxpayer's affiliates cannot claim tax credits for more than
 21 28 five investments in five different qualifying businesses.  The
 21 29 division amends this dollar limitation to prohibit a natural
 21 30 person and the person's spouse, child, or sibling from claiming
 21 31 a combined amount of more than $100,000 in tax credits per tax
 21 32 year.
 21 33    The division also provides that no more than $500,000 in tax
 21 34 credits may be issued per tax year for equity investments in
 21 35 any one qualifying business.
 22  1 The division modifies the procedures for claiming the tax
 22  2 credit.  Under current law, the tax credit is not refundable
 22  3 but available for carryforward for up to five tax years.  The
 22  4 division makes the tax credit refundable for an investment
 22  5 made by a natural person, and for any other person reduces the
 22  6 carryforward period to three years.
 22  7    The division strikes a provision permitting the EDA
 22  8 to cooperate with small business development centers to
 22  9 disseminate information regarding the credits and to develop
 22 10 standard application forms, and requiring the EDA to distribute
 22 11 copies of the application forms to all community=based seed
 22 12 capital funds and potential individual investors.
 22 13    The division modifies the eligibility requirements for
 22 14 qualifying businesses.  The division strikes the requirement
 22 15 that a business have an owner that meets at least one of
 22 16 four qualifications relating to business education or
 22 17 business experience.  The division requires that a business
 22 18 be participating in an entrepreneurial assistance program,
 22 19 as defined in the division, but allows the EDA to waive this
 22 20 requirement if the business establishes that its owners,
 22 21 directors, officers, and employees have an appropriate level
 22 22 of experience such that an entrepreneurial assistance program
 22 23 would not materially change the prospects of the business.
 22 24 The EDA is allowed to consult with outside service providers
 22 25 in considering such a waiver.  The division increases from $5
 22 26 million to $10 million the maximum amount of net worth that
 22 27 a business may have to be considered a qualifying business.
 22 28 The division increases from $250,000 to $500,000 the amount of
 22 29 financing that a business must have in order to be considered a
 22 30 qualifying business, removes "near equity" from the types of
 22 31 financing that will be considered in that calculation, requires
 22 32 that the financing be secured at the time of application for
 22 33 the tax credits, and requires that the business have at least
 22 34 two investors at the time of application for the tax credits.
 22 35 These modified eligibility requirements apply to businesses
 23  1 that submit an application to the EDA to be registered as a
 23  2 qualifying business on or after the effective date of this
 23  3 division of the bill, and businesses that submitted such an
 23  4 application to the EDA before the effective date of this
 23  5 division of the bill shall be governed by current law.
 23  6    The division provides for the confidentiality of certain
 23  7 information with regard to the tax credit.  The identity of
 23  8 a qualifying business, the identity of an investor and the
 23  9 qualifying business in which the investor made an equity
 23 10 investment, and the total number and amount of tax credits
 23 11 issued shall be considered public information under Code
 23 12 chapter 22 (examination of public records), but any other
 23 13 information or record in the possession of the EDA with respect
 23 14 to the program shall be presumed by the EDA to be a trade secret
 23 15 protected under Code chapter 550 or common law and shall be
 23 16 kept confidential by the EDA unless otherwise ordered by a
 23 17 court.
 23 18    The division takes effect upon enactment and applies to
 23 19 equity investments in a qualifying business made on or after
 23 20 that date.  Equity investments in a qualifying business or
 23 21 community=based seed capital fund made prior to the effective
 23 22 date of the division shall be governed by current law.
 23 23    DIVISION III ==== ENTREPRENEUR INVESTMENT AWARDS PROGRAM.
 23 24  Division III amends the entrepreneur investment awards program
 23 25 administered by the EDA.  The division strikes provisions that
 23 26 prohibited the EDA from making awards under the program since
 23 27 July 1, 2014, and that required the EDA by December 31, 2014,
 23 28 to conduct a comprehensive review of the program and submit
 23 29 a report with specified information to the governor and the

 23 31    The division modifies the purpose of the program to be
 23 32 to provide financial assistance to eligible entrepreneurial
 23 33 assistance providers (provider) that provide technical and
 23 34 financial assistance to entrepreneurs and start=up companies
 23 35 seeking to create, locate, or expand a business in Iowa.
 24  1 "Financial assistance" is defined in the division.
 24  2    The division changes the requirements for receiving an
 24  3 award.  To be eligible to receive an award under current
 24  4 law, an entrepreneurial assistance program must have been
 24  5 an Iowa=based business, expended at least $500,000 during
 24  6 the previous fiscal year to provide technical and financial
 24  7 assistance services that meet the broad=based needs of

 24  9 in Iowa that intends to derive more than 10 percent of its
 24 10 gross sales from markets outside Iowa; and must have engaged
 24 11 and communicated with certain other programs, funding sources,
 24 12 and entities for its entrepreneur clients.  The division
 24 13 amends the eligibility for receiving financial assistance to

 24 15 in Iowa and that the provider offer a comprehensive set of
 24 16 business development services to emerging and early=stage
 24 17 innovation companies to assist in the creation, location,
 24 18 growth, and long=term success of the company in Iowa.
 24 19 "Business development services" is defined in the division.
 24 20 Business development services may be performed at the physical
 24 21 location of the provider or the company and may be provided in
 24 22 consideration of equity participation in the company, a fee for
 24 23 services, or a membership agreement with the company.
 24 24    Under current law, the EDA board could approve, deny, or
 24 25 defer each application for a grant, and was required to award
 24 26 grants on a first=come, first=served basis.  The division
 24 27 specifies that the EDA board has the discretion to approve,
 24 28 deny, or defer each application for financial assistance and
 24 29 that the amount of financial assistance awarded to a provider
 24 30 is within the discretion of the EDA.  The division requires
 24 31 the EDA to award financial assistance on a competitive basis
 24 32 and allows the EDA to develop scoring criteria and establish
 24 33 minimum requirements for the receipt of a financial assistance
 24 34 award.
 24 35    In addition to the four factors relating to the provider's
 25  1 professional staff that the EDA may consider under current
 25  2 law in deciding whether to award financial assistance, the
 25  3 division provides that the EDA may also consider the service
 25  4 model and likelihood of success of the provider, the provider's
 25  5 similarity to other successful providers in the country, and
 25  6 the provider's financial need.
 25  7    The division modifies the maximum award amount for a
 25  8 recipient.  Under current law, a grant to an entrepreneur
 25  9 assistance program cannot exceed the lesser of 25 percent of
 25 10 the funds expended by the program during the previous fiscal
 25 11 year, 100 percent of the funds raised from certain persons
 25 12 by the program during the previous fiscal year, or $200,000.
 25 13 The division provides that the amount of financial assistance
 25 14 awarded to any one provider shall not exceed $200,000.
 25 15    The division modifies the permitted use of funds received
 25 16 under the program.  Under current law, grants are only
 25 17 permitted to be used for the purpose of operating costs
 25 18 incurred by the program.  The division specifies that financial
 25 19 assistance awarded to a provider shall only be used for
 25 20 the purpose of operating costs incurred by the provider in
 25 21 the provision of business development services to emerging
 25 22 and early=stage innovation companies in Iowa.  The division
 25 23 further requires that such financial assistance shall not be
 25 24 distributed to owners or investors of the company to which the
 25 25 business development services are being provided and shall not
 25 26 be provided to other persons assisting with the provision of
 25 27 the services.
 25 28    Under current law, an entrepreneurial assistance provider is
 25 29 required to accept client referrals from the EDA as a condition
 25 30 of receiving a grant.  The division provides that the EDA may
 25 31 make client referrals to eligible providers.
 25 32    DIVISION IV ==== MISCELLANEOUS CHANGES.  Division IV makes
 25 33 several miscellaneous changes to other EDA programs.  The
 25 34 division amends the sales and use tax refund available under

 26  5 facility operated by the eligible business is at least 50
 26  6 percent of the initial design capacity of the facility.  The
 26  7 division amends the definition of "project completion" to mean
 26  8 the date on which the EDA notifies the department of revenue
 26  9 that all applicable requirements of a workforce housing tax
 26 10 incentive program agreement are satisfied.  This provision

 21  8    The division takes effect upon enactment and applies to
 21  9 renewable chemicals produced in Iowa from biomass feedstock on
 21 10 or after that date.  The division applies retroactively to tax
 21 11 years beginning on or after January 1, 2015.
 21 12    DIVISION II ==== ANGEL INVESTOR TAX CREDITS.   Division II
 21 13 makes several changes to the tax credit for investments in
 21 14 qualifying businesses and community=based seed capital funds,
 21 15 often referred to as the angel investor tax credits.  The
 21 16 division amends the purpose of the tax credit in Code section
 21 17 15E.41.  The division excludes investments in community=based
 21 18 seed capital funds from qualifying for the tax credit and
 21 19 makes several conforming amendments to remove references to
 21 20 community=based seed capital funds from the Code.
 21 21    The division modifies the amount and dollar limitation of
 21 22 the tax credit for a taxpayer.  The tax credit is increased
 21 23 from 20 percent to 25 percent of a taxpayer's equity investment
 21 24 in a qualifying business.  Under current law, a taxpayer cannot
 21 25 claim more than $50,000 of tax credit per investment in a
 21 26 qualifying business, and for each tax year a taxpayer and the
 21 27 taxpayer's affiliates cannot claim tax credits for more than
 21 28 five investments in five different qualifying businesses.  The
 21 29 division amends this dollar limitation to prohibit a natural
 21 30 person and the person's spouse, child, or sibling from claiming
 21 31 a combined amount of more than $100,000 in tax credits per tax
 21 32 year.
 21 33    The division also provides that no more than $500,000 in tax
 21 34 credits may be issued per tax year for equity investments in
 21 35 any one qualifying business.
 22  1 The division modifies the procedures for claiming the tax
 22  2 credit.  Under current law, the tax credit is not refundable
 22  3 but available for carryforward for up to five tax years.  The
 22  4 division makes the tax credit refundable for an investment
 22  5 made by a natural person, and for any other person reduces the
 22  6 carryforward period to three years.
 22  7    The division strikes a provision permitting the EDA
 22  8 to cooperate with small business development centers to
 22  9 disseminate information regarding the credits and to develop
 22 10 standard application forms, and requiring the EDA to distribute
 22 11 copies of the application forms to all community=based seed
 22 12 capital funds and potential individual investors.
 22 13    The division modifies the eligibility requirements for
 22 14 qualifying businesses.  The division strikes the requirement
 22 15 that a business have an owner that meets at least one of
 22 16 four qualifications relating to business education or
 22 17 business experience.  The division requires that a business
 22 18 be participating in an entrepreneurial assistance program,
 22 19 as defined in the division, but allows the EDA to waive this
 22 20 requirement if the business establishes that its owners,
 22 21 directors, officers, and employees have an appropriate level
 22 22 of experience such that an entrepreneurial assistance program
 22 23 would not materially change the prospects of the business.
 22 24 The EDA is allowed to consult with outside service providers
 22 25 in considering such a waiver.  The division increases from $5
 22 26 million to $10 million the maximum amount of net worth that
 22 27 a business may have to be considered a qualifying business.
 22 28 The division increases from $250,000 to $500,000 the amount of
 22 29 financing that a business must have in order to be considered a
 22 30 qualifying business, removes "near equity" from the types of
 22 31 financing that will be considered in that calculation, requires
 22 32 that the financing be secured at the time of application for
 22 33 the tax credits, and requires that the business have at least
 22 34 two investors at the time of application for the tax credits.
 22 35 These modified eligibility requirements apply to businesses
 23  1 that submit an application to the EDA to be registered as a
 23  2 qualifying business on or after the effective date of this
 23  3 division of the bill, and businesses that submitted such an
 23  4 application to the EDA before the effective date of this
 23  5 division of the bill shall be governed by current law.
 23  6    The division provides for the confidentiality of certain
 23  7 information with regard to the tax credit.  The identity of
 23  8 a qualifying business, the identity of an investor and the
 23  9 qualifying business in which the investor made an equity
 23 10 investment, and the total number and amount of tax credits
 23 11 issued shall be considered public information under Code
 23 12 chapter 22 (examination of public records), but any other
 23 13 information or record in the possession of the EDA with respect
 23 14 to the program shall be presumed by the EDA to be a trade secret
 23 15 protected under Code chapter 550 or common law and shall be
 23 16 kept confidential by the EDA unless otherwise ordered by a
 23 17 court.
 23 18    The division takes effect upon enactment and applies to
 23 19 equity investments in a qualifying business made on or after
 23 20 that date.  Equity investments in a qualifying business or
 23 21 community=based seed capital fund made prior to the effective
 23 22 date of the division shall be governed by current law.
 23 23    DIVISION III ==== ENTREPRENEUR INVESTMENT AWARDS PROGRAM.
 23 24  Division III amends the entrepreneur investment awards program
 23 25 administered by the EDA.  The division strikes provisions that
 23 26 prohibited the EDA from making awards under the program since
 23 27 July 1, 2014, and that required the EDA by December 31, 2014,
 23 28 to conduct a comprehensive review of the program and submit
 23 29 a report with specified information to the governor and the
 23 30 general assembly.
 23 31    The division modifies the purpose of the program to be
 23 32 to provide financial assistance to eligible entrepreneurial
 23 33 assistance providers (provider) that provide technical and
 23 34 financial assistance to entrepreneurs and start=up companies
 23 35 seeking to create, locate, or expand a business in Iowa.
 24  1 "Financial assistance" is defined in the division.
 24  2    The division changes the requirements for receiving an
 24  3 award.  To be eligible to receive an award under current
 24  4 law, an entrepreneurial assistance program must have been
 24  5 an Iowa=based business, expended at least $500,000 during
 24  6 the previous fiscal year to provide technical and financial
 24  7 assistance services that meet the broad=based needs of
 24  8 entrepreneurs seeking to create, locate, or expand a business
 24  9 in Iowa that intends to derive more than 10 percent of its
 24 10 gross sales from markets outside Iowa; and must have engaged
 24 11 and communicated with certain other programs, funding sources,
 24 12 and entities for its entrepreneur clients.  The division
 24 13 amends the eligibility for receiving financial assistance to
 24 14 require that a provider have its principal place of operations
 24 15 in Iowa and that the provider offer a comprehensive set of
 24 16 business development services to emerging and early=stage
 24 17 innovation companies to assist in the creation, location,
 24 18 growth, and long=term success of the company in Iowa.
 24 19 "Business development services" is defined in the division.
 24 20 Business development services may be performed at the physical
 24 21 location of the provider or the company and may be provided in
 24 22 consideration of equity participation in the company, a fee for
 24 23 services, or a membership agreement with the company.
 24 24    Under current law, the EDA board could approve, deny, or
 24 25 defer each application for a grant, and was required to award
 24 26 grants on a first=come, first=served basis.  The division
 24 27 specifies that the EDA board has the discretion to approve,
 24 28 deny, or defer each application for financial assistance and
 24 29 that the amount of financial assistance awarded to a provider
 24 30 is within the discretion of the EDA.  The division requires
 24 31 the EDA to award financial assistance on a competitive basis
 24 32 and allows the EDA to develop scoring criteria and establish
 24 33 minimum requirements for the receipt of a financial assistance
 24 34 award.
 24 35    In addition to the four factors relating to the provider's
 25  1 professional staff that the EDA may consider under current
 25  2 law in deciding whether to award financial assistance, the
 25  3 division provides that the EDA may also consider the service
 25  4 model and likelihood of success of the provider, the provider's
 25  5 similarity to other successful providers in the country, and
 25  6 the provider's financial need.
 25  7    The division modifies the maximum award amount for a
 25  8 recipient.  Under current law, a grant to an entrepreneur
 25  9 assistance program cannot exceed the lesser of 25 percent of
 25 10 the funds expended by the program during the previous fiscal
 25 11 year, 100 percent of the funds raised from certain persons
 25 12 by the program during the previous fiscal year, or $200,000.
 25 13 The division provides that the amount of financial assistance
 25 14 awarded to any one provider shall not exceed $200,000.
 25 15    The division modifies the permitted use of funds received
 25 16 under the program.  Under current law, grants are only
 25 17 permitted to be used for the purpose of operating costs
 25 18 incurred by the program.  The division specifies that financial
 25 19 assistance awarded to a provider shall only be used for
 25 20 the purpose of operating costs incurred by the provider in
 25 21 the provision of business development services to emerging
 25 22 and early=stage innovation companies in Iowa.  The division
 25 23 further requires that such financial assistance shall not be
 25 24 distributed to owners or investors of the company to which the
 25 25 business development services are being provided and shall not
 25 26 be provided to other persons assisting with the provision of
 25 27 the services.
 25 28    Under current law, an entrepreneurial assistance provider is
 25 29 required to accept client referrals from the EDA as a condition
 25 30 of receiving a grant.  The division provides that the EDA may
 25 31 make client referrals to eligible providers.
 25 32    DIVISION IV ==== MISCELLANEOUS CHANGES.  Division IV makes
 25 33 several miscellaneous changes to other EDA programs.  The
 25 34 division amends the sales and use tax refund available under
 25 35 the workforce housing tax incentive program.  That refund
 26  1 is available for sales and use tax paid prior to project
 26  2 completion, which is currently defined to mean the first date
 26  3 upon which the average annualized production of finished
 26  4 product for the preceding 90=day period at the manufacturing
 26  5 facility operated by the eligible business is at least 50
 26  6 percent of the initial design capacity of the facility.  The
 26  7 division amends the definition of "project completion" to mean
 26  8 the date on which the EDA notifies the department of revenue
 26  9 that all applicable requirements of a workforce housing tax
 26 10 incentive program agreement are satisfied.  This provision
 26 11 takes effect upon enactment and applies retroactively to July
 26 12 1, 2014, for all workforce housing tax incentive agreements
 26 13 entered into on or after that date.
 26 14    The division allows the EDA to extend the project
 26 15 completion date for a project awarded tax incentives under the
 26 16 redevelopment tax credit program and the housing enterprise
 26 17 zone tax incentives program if the property that is the subject
 26 18 of the project suffered a catastrophic fire during the 2014
 26 19 calendar year.
       LSB 1212HV (3) 86
       mm/sc
 21  7 otherwise ordered by a court.
 21  8    The division takes effect upon enactment and applies to
 21  9 renewable chemicals produced in Iowa from biomass feedstock on
 21 10 or after that date.  The division applies retroactively to tax
 21 11 years beginning on or after January 1, 2015.
 21 12    DIVISION II ==== ANGEL INVESTOR TAX CREDITS.   Division II
 21 13 makes several changes to the tax credit for investments in
 21 14 qualifying businesses and community=based seed capital funds,
 21 15 often referred to as the angel investor tax credits.  The
 21 16 division amends the purpose of the tax credit in Code section
 21 17 15E.41.  The division excludes investments in community=based
 21 18 seed capital funds from qualifying for the tax credit and
 21 19 makes several conforming amendments to remove references to
 21 20 community=based seed capital funds from the Code.
 21 21    The division modifies the amount and dollar limitation of
 21 22 the tax credit for a taxpayer.  The tax credit is increased
 21 23 from 20 percent to 25 percent of a taxpayer's equity investment
 21 24 in a qualifying business.  Under current law, a taxpayer cannot
 21 25 claim more than $50,000 of tax credit per investment in a
 21 26 qualifying business, and for each tax year a taxpayer and the
 21 27 taxpayer's affiliates cannot claim tax credits for more than
 21 28 five investments in five different qualifying businesses.  The
 21 29 division amends this dollar limitation to prohibit a natural
 21 30 person and the person's spouse, child, or sibling from claiming
 21 31 a combined amount of more than $100,000 in tax credits per tax
 21 32 year.
 21 33    The division also provides that no more than $500,000 in tax
 21 34 credits may be issued per tax year for equity investments in
 21 35 any one qualifying business.
 22  1 The division modifies the procedures for claiming the tax
 22  2 credit.  Under current law, the tax credit is not refundable
 22  3 but available for carryforward for up to five tax years.  The
 22  4 division makes the tax credit refundable for an investment
 22  5 made by a natural person, and for any other person reduces the
 22  6 carryforward period to three years.
 22  7    The division strikes a provision permitting the EDA
 22  8 to cooperate with small business development centers to
 22  9 disseminate information regarding the credits and to develop
 22 10 standard application forms, and requiring the EDA to distribute
 22 11 copies of the application forms to all community=based seed
 22 12 capital funds and potential individual investors.
 22 13    The division modifies the eligibility requirements for
 22 14 qualifying businesses.  The division strikes the requirement
 22 15 that a business have an owner that meets at least one of
 22 16 four qualifications relating to business education or
 22 17 business experience.  The division requires that a business
 22 18 be participating in an entrepreneurial assistance program,
 22 19 as defined in the division, but allows the EDA to waive this
 22 20 requirement if the business establishes that its owners,
 22 21 directors, officers, and employees have an appropriate level
 22 22 of experience such that an entrepreneurial assistance program
 22 23 would not materially change the prospects of the business.
 22 24 The EDA is allowed to consult with outside service providers
 22 25 in considering such a waiver.  The division increases from $5
 22 26 million to $10 million the maximum amount of net worth that
 22 27 a business may have to be considered a qualifying business.
 22 28 The division increases from $250,000 to $500,000 the amount of
 22 29 financing that a business must have in order to be considered a
 22 30 qualifying business, removes "near equity" from the types of
 22 31 financing that will be considered in that calculation, requires
 22 32 that the financing be secured at the time of application for
 22 33 the tax credits, and requires that the business have at least
 22 34 two investors at the time of application for the tax credits.
 22 35 These modified eligibility requirements apply to businesses
 23  1 that submit an application to the EDA to be registered as a
 23  2 qualifying business on or after the effective date of this
 23  3 division of the bill, and businesses that submitted such an
 23  4 application to the EDA before the effective date of this
 23  5 division of the bill shall be governed by current law.
 23  6    The division provides for the confidentiality of certain
 23  7 information with regard to the tax credit.  The identity of
 23  8 a qualifying business, the identity of an investor and the
 23  9 qualifying business in which the investor made an equity
 23 10 investment, and the total number and amount of tax credits
 23 11 issued shall be considered public information under Code
 23 12 chapter 22 (examination of public records), but any other
 23 13 information or record in the possession of the EDA with respect
 23 14 to the program shall be presumed by the EDA to be a trade secret
 23 15 protected under Code chapter 550 or common law and shall be
 23 16 kept confidential by the EDA unless otherwise ordered by a
 23 17 court.
 23 18    The division takes effect upon enactment and applies to
 23 19 equity investments in a qualifying business made on or after
 23 20 that date.  Equity investments in a qualifying business or
 23 21 community=based seed capital fund made prior to the effective
 23 22 date of the division shall be governed by current law.
 23 23    DIVISION III ==== ENTREPRENEUR INVESTMENT AWARDS PROGRAM.
 23 24  Division III amends the entrepreneur investment awards program
 23 25 administered by the EDA.  The division strikes provisions that

 24 17 innovation companies to assist in the creation, location,
 24 18 growth, and long=term success of the company in Iowa.
 24 19 "Business development services" is defined in the division.
 24 20 Business development services may be performed at the physical
 24 21 location of the provider or the company and may be provided in
 24 22 consideration of equity participation in the company, a fee for
 24 23 services, or a membership agreement with the company.
 24 24    Under current law, the EDA board could approve, deny, or
 24 25 defer each application for a grant, and was required to award
 24 26 grants on a first=come, first=served basis.  The division
 24 27 specifies that the EDA board has the discretion to approve,
 24 28 deny, or defer each application for financial assistance and
 24 29 that the amount of financial assistance awarded to a provider
 24 30 is within the discretion of the EDA.  The division requires
 24 31 the EDA to award financial assistance on a competitive basis
 24 32 and allows the EDA to develop scoring criteria and establish
 24 33 minimum requirements for the receipt of a financial assistance
 24 34 award.
 24 35    In addition to the four factors relating to the provider's
 25  1 professional staff that the EDA may consider under current
 25  2 law in deciding whether to award financial assistance, the
 25  3 division provides that the EDA may also consider the service

 25  9 assistance program cannot exceed the lesser of 25 percent of
 25 10 the funds expended by the program during the previous fiscal
 25 11 year, 100 percent of the funds raised from certain persons
 25 12 by the program during the previous fiscal year, or $200,000.
 25 13 The division provides that the amount of financial assistance
 25 14 awarded to any one provider shall not exceed $200,000.
 25 15    The division modifies the permitted use of funds received

 25 28    Under current law, an entrepreneurial assistance provider is

 23 23    DIVISION III ==== ENTREPRENEUR INVESTMENT AWARDS PROGRAM.

 24  1 "Financial assistance" is defined in the division.
 24  2    The division changes the requirements for receiving an
 24  3 award.  To be eligible to receive an award under current
 24  4 law, an entrepreneurial assistance program must have been
 24  5 an Iowa=based business, expended at least $500,000 during
 24  6 the previous fiscal year to provide technical and financial
 24  7 assistance services that meet the broad=based needs of
 24  8 entrepreneurs seeking to create, locate, or expand a business
 24  9 in Iowa that intends to derive more than 10 percent of its
 24 10 gross sales from markets outside Iowa; and must have engaged
 24 11 and communicated with certain other programs, funding sources,
 24 12 and entities for its entrepreneur clients.  The division
 24 13 amends the eligibility for receiving financial assistance to
 24 14 require that a provider have its principal place of operations
 24 15 in Iowa and that the provider offer a comprehensive set of
 24 16 business development services to emerging and early=stage
 24 17 innovation companies to assist in the creation, location,
 24 18 growth, and long=term success of the company in Iowa.
 24 19 "Business development services" is defined in the division.
 24 20 Business development services may be performed at the physical
 24 21 location of the provider or the company and may be provided in
 24 22 consideration of equity participation in the company, a fee for
 24 23 services, or a membership agreement with the company.
 24 24    Under current law, the EDA board could approve, deny, or
 24 25 defer each application for a grant, and was required to award
 24 26 grants on a first=come, first=served basis.  The division
 24 27 specifies that the EDA board has the discretion to approve,
 24 28 deny, or defer each application for financial assistance and
 24 29 that the amount of financial assistance awarded to a provider
 24 30 is within the discretion of the EDA.  The division requires
 24 31 the EDA to award financial assistance on a competitive basis
 24 32 and allows the EDA to develop scoring criteria and establish
 24 33 minimum requirements for the receipt of a financial assistance
 24 34 award.
 24 35    In addition to the four factors relating to the provider's
 25  1 professional staff that the EDA may consider under current
 25  2 law in deciding whether to award financial assistance, the
 25  3 division provides that the EDA may also consider the service
 25  4 model and likelihood of success of the provider, the provider's
 25  5 similarity to other successful providers in the country, and
 25  6 the provider's financial need.
 25  7    The division modifies the maximum award amount for a
 25  8 recipient.  Under current law, a grant to an entrepreneur
 25  9 assistance program cannot exceed the lesser of 25 percent of
 25 10 the funds expended by the program during the previous fiscal
 25 11 year, 100 percent of the funds raised from certain persons
 25 12 by the program during the previous fiscal year, or $200,000.
 25 13 The division provides that the amount of financial assistance
 25 14 awarded to any one provider shall not exceed $200,000.
 25 15    The division modifies the permitted use of funds received
 25 16 under the program.  Under current law, grants are only
 25 17 permitted to be used for the purpose of operating costs
 25 18 incurred by the program.  The division specifies that financial
 25 19 assistance awarded to a provider shall only be used for
 25 20 the purpose of operating costs incurred by the provider in
 25 21 the provision of business development services to emerging
 25 22 and early=stage innovation companies in Iowa.  The division
 25 23 further requires that such financial assistance shall not be
 25 24 distributed to owners or investors of the company to which the
 25 25 business development services are being provided and shall not
 25 26 be provided to other persons assisting with the provision of
 25 27 the services.
 25 28    Under current law, an entrepreneurial assistance provider is
 25 29 required to accept client referrals from the EDA as a condition
 25 30 of receiving a grant.  The division provides that the EDA may
 25 31 make client referrals to eligible providers.
 25 32    DIVISION IV ==== MISCELLANEOUS CHANGES.  Division IV makes
 25 33 several miscellaneous changes to other EDA programs.  The
 25 34 division amends the sales and use tax refund available under
 25 35 the workforce housing tax incentive program.  That refund
 26  1 is available for sales and use tax paid prior to project
 26  2 completion, which is currently defined to mean the first date
 26  3 upon which the average annualized production of finished
 26  4 product for the preceding 90=day period at the manufacturing
 26  5 facility operated by the eligible business is at least 50
 26  6 percent of the initial design capacity of the facility.  The
 26  7 division amends the definition of "project completion" to mean
 26  8 the date on which the EDA notifies the department of revenue
 26  9 that all applicable requirements of a workforce housing tax
 26 10 incentive program agreement are satisfied.  This provision
 26 11 takes effect upon enactment and applies retroactively to July
 26 12 1, 2014, for all workforce housing tax incentive agreements
 26 13 entered into on or after that date.
 26 14    The division allows the EDA to extend the project
 26 15 completion date for a project awarded tax incentives under the
 26 16 redevelopment tax credit program and the housing enterprise
 26 17 zone tax incentives program if the property that is the subject
 26 18 of the project suffered a catastrophic fire during the 2014
 26 19 calendar year.

 21  9 renewable chemicals produced in Iowa from biomass feedstock on
 21 10 or after that date.  The division applies retroactively to tax
 21 11 years beginning on or after January 1, 2015.
 21 12    DIVISION II ==== ANGEL INVESTOR TAX CREDITS.   Division II
 21 13 makes several changes to the tax credit for investments in
 21 14 qualifying businesses and community=based seed capital funds,
 21 15 often referred to as the angel investor tax credits.  The
 21 16 division amends the purpose of the tax credit in Code section
 21 17 15E.41.  The division excludes investments in community=based
 21 18 seed capital funds from qualifying for the tax credit and
 21 19 makes several conforming amendments to remove references to
 21 20 community=based seed capital funds from the Code.
 21 21    The division modifies the amount and dollar limitation of
 21 22 the tax credit for a taxpayer.  The tax credit is increased
 21 23 from 20 percent to 25 percent of a taxpayer's equity investment
 21 24 in a qualifying business.  Under current law, a taxpayer cannot
 21 25 claim more than $50,000 of tax credit per investment in a
 21 26 qualifying business, and for each tax year a taxpayer and the
 21 27 taxpayer's affiliates cannot claim tax credits for more than
 21 28 five investments in five different qualifying businesses.  The
 21 29 division amends this dollar limitation to prohibit a natural
 21 30 person and the person's spouse, child, or sibling from claiming
 21 31 a combined amount of more than $100,000 in tax credits per tax
 21 32 year.
 21 33    The division also provides that no more than $500,000 in tax
 21 34 credits may be issued per tax year for equity investments in
 21 35 any one qualifying business.
 22  1 The division modifies the procedures for claiming the tax
 22  2 credit.  Under current law, the tax credit is not refundable
 22  3 but available for carryforward for up to five tax years.  The
 22  4 division makes the tax credit refundable for an investment
 22  5 made by a natural person, and for any other person reduces the
 22  6 carryforward period to three years.
 22  7    The division strikes a provision permitting the EDA
 22  8 to cooperate with small business development centers to
 22  9 disseminate information regarding the credits and to develop
 22 10 standard application forms, and requiring the EDA to distribute
 22 11 copies of the application forms to all community=based seed
 22 12 capital funds and potential individual investors.
 22 13    The division modifies the eligibility requirements for
 22 14 qualifying businesses.  The division strikes the requirement
 22 15 that a business have an owner that meets at least one of
 22 16 four qualifications relating to business education or
 22 17 business experience.  The division requires that a business
 22 18 be participating in an entrepreneurial assistance program,
 22 19 as defined in the division, but allows the EDA to waive this
 22 20 requirement if the business establishes that its owners,
 22 21 directors, officers, and employees have an appropriate level
 22 22 of experience such that an entrepreneurial assistance program
 22 23 would not materially change the prospects of the business.
 22 24 The EDA is allowed to consult with outside service providers
 22 25 in considering such a waiver.  The division increases from $5
 22 26 million to $10 million the maximum amount of net worth that
 22 27 a business may have to be considered a qualifying business.
 22 28 The division increases from $250,000 to $500,000 the amount of
 22 29 financing that a business must have in order to be considered a
 22 30 qualifying business, removes "near equity" from the types of
 22 31 financing that will be considered in that calculation, requires
 22 32 that the financing be secured at the time of application for
 22 33 the tax credits, and requires that the business have at least
 22 34 two investors at the time of application for the tax credits.
 22 35 These modified eligibility requirements apply to businesses
 23  1 that submit an application to the EDA to be registered as a
 23  2 qualifying business on or after the effective date of this
 23  3 division of the bill, and businesses that submitted such an
 23  4 application to the EDA before the effective date of this
 23  5 division of the bill shall be governed by current law.
 23  6    The division provides for the confidentiality of certain
 23  7 information with regard to the tax credit.  The identity of
 23  8 a qualifying business, the identity of an investor and the
 23  9 qualifying business in which the investor made an equity
 23 10 investment, and the total number and amount of tax credits
 23 11 issued shall be considered public information under Code
 23 12 chapter 22 (examination of public records), but any other
 23 13 information or record in the possession of the EDA with respect
 23 14 to the program shall be presumed by the EDA to be a trade secret
 23 15 protected under Code chapter 550 or common law and shall be
 23 16 kept confidential by the EDA unless otherwise ordered by a
 23 17 court.
 23 18    The division takes effect upon enactment and applies to
 23 19 equity investments in a qualifying business made on or after
 23 20 that date.  Equity investments in a qualifying business or
 23 21 community=based seed capital fund made prior to the effective
 23 22 date of the division shall be governed by current law.
 23 23    DIVISION III ==== ENTREPRENEUR INVESTMENT AWARDS PROGRAM.
 23 24  Division III amends the entrepreneur investment awards program
 23 25 administered by the EDA.  The division strikes provisions that
 23 26 prohibited the EDA from making awards under the program since
 23 27 July 1, 2014, and that required the EDA by December 31, 2014,
 23 28 to conduct a comprehensive review of the program and submit
 23 29 a report with specified information to the governor and the
 23 30 general assembly.
 23 31    The division modifies the purpose of the program to be
 23 32 to provide financial assistance to eligible entrepreneurial
 23 33 assistance providers (provider) that provide technical and
 23 34 financial assistance to entrepreneurs and start=up companies
 23 35 seeking to create, locate, or expand a business in Iowa.
 24  1 "Financial assistance" is defined in the division.
 24  2    The division changes the requirements for receiving an
 24  3 award.  To be eligible to receive an award under current
 24  4 law, an entrepreneurial assistance program must have been
 24  5 an Iowa=based business, expended at least $500,000 during
 24  6 the previous fiscal year to provide technical and financial
 24  7 assistance services that meet the broad=based needs of
 24  8 entrepreneurs seeking to create, locate, or expand a business
 24  9 in Iowa that intends to derive more than 10 percent of its
 24 10 gross sales from markets outside Iowa; and must have engaged
 24 11 and communicated with certain other programs, funding sources,
 24 12 and entities for its entrepreneur clients.  The division
 24 13 amends the eligibility for receiving financial assistance to
 24 14 require that a provider have its principal place of operations
 24 15 in Iowa and that the provider offer a comprehensive set of
 24 16 business development services to emerging and early=stage
 24 17 innovation companies to assist in the creation, location,
 24 18 growth, and long=term success of the company in Iowa.
 24 19 "Business development services" is defined in the division.
 24 20 Business development services may be performed at the physical
 24 21 location of the provider or the company and may be provided in
 24 22 consideration of equity participation in the company, a fee for
 24 23 services, or a membership agreement with the company.
 24 24    Under current law, the EDA board could approve, deny, or
 24 25 defer each application for a grant, and was required to award
 24 26 grants on a first=come, first=served basis.  The division
 24 27 specifies that the EDA board has the discretion to approve,
 24 28 deny, or defer each application for financial assistance and
 24 29 that the amount of financial assistance awarded to a provider
 24 30 is within the discretion of the EDA.  The division requires
 24 31 the EDA to award financial assistance on a competitive basis
 24 32 and allows the EDA to develop scoring criteria and establish
 24 33 minimum requirements for the receipt of a financial assistance
 24 34 award.
 24 35    In addition to the four factors relating to the provider's
 25  1 professional staff that the EDA may consider under current
 25  2 law in deciding whether to award financial assistance, the
 25  3 division provides that the EDA may also consider the service
 25  4 model and likelihood of success of the provider, the provider's
 25  5 similarity to other successful providers in the country, and
 25  6 the provider's financial need.
 25  7    The division modifies the maximum award amount for a
 25  8 recipient.  Under current law, a grant to an entrepreneur
 25  9 assistance program cannot exceed the lesser of 25 percent of
 25 10 the funds expended by the program during the previous fiscal
 25 11 year, 100 percent of the funds raised from certain persons
 25 12 by the program during the previous fiscal year, or $200,000.
 25 13 The division provides that the amount of financial assistance
 25 14 awarded to any one provider shall not exceed $200,000.
 25 15    The division modifies the permitted use of funds received
 25 16 under the program.  Under current law, grants are only
 25 17 permitted to be used for the purpose of operating costs
 25 18 incurred by the program.  The division specifies that financial
 25 19 assistance awarded to a provider shall only be used for
 25 20 the purpose of operating costs incurred by the provider in
 25 21 the provision of business development services to emerging
 25 22 and early=stage innovation companies in Iowa.  The division
 25 23 further requires that such financial assistance shall not be
 25 24 distributed to owners or investors of the company to which the
 25 25 business development services are being provided and shall not
 25 26 be provided to other persons assisting with the provision of
 25 27 the services.
 25 28    Under current law, an entrepreneurial assistance provider is
 25 29 required to accept client referrals from the EDA as a condition
 25 30 of receiving a grant.  The division provides that the EDA may
 25 31 make client referrals to eligible providers.
 25 32    DIVISION IV ==== MISCELLANEOUS CHANGES.  Division IV makes
 25 33 several miscellaneous changes to other EDA programs.  The
 25 34 division amends the sales and use tax refund available under
 25 35 the workforce housing tax incentive program.  That refund
 26  1 is available for sales and use tax paid prior to project
 26  2 completion, which is currently defined to mean the first date
 26  3 upon which the average annualized production of finished
 26  4 product for the preceding 90=day period at the manufacturing
 26  5 facility operated by the eligible business is at least 50
 26  6 percent of the initial design capacity of the facility.  The
 26  7 division amends the definition of "project completion" to mean
 26  8 the date on which the EDA notifies the department of revenue
 26  9 that all applicable requirements of a workforce housing tax
 26 10 incentive program agreement are satisfied.  This provision
 26 11 takes effect upon enactment and applies retroactively to July

 26 15 completion date for a project awarded tax incentives under the
 26 16 redevelopment tax credit program and the housing enterprise
 26 17 zone tax incentives program if the property that is the subject
 26 18 of the project suffered a catastrophic fire during the 2014

 21 11 years beginning on or after January 1, 2015.
 21 12    DIVISION II ==== ANGEL INVESTOR TAX CREDITS.   Division II
 21 13 makes several changes to the tax credit for investments in
 21 14 qualifying businesses and community=based seed capital funds,
 21 15 often referred to as the angel investor tax credits.  The
 21 16 division amends the purpose of the tax credit in Code section
 21 17 15E.41.  The division excludes investments in community=based
 21 18 seed capital funds from qualifying for the tax credit and
 21 19 makes several conforming amendments to remove references to
 21 20 community=based seed capital funds from the Code.
 21 21    The division modifies the amount and dollar limitation of
 21 22 the tax credit for a taxpayer.  The tax credit is increased
 21 23 from 20 percent to 25 percent of a taxpayer's equity investment
 21 24 in a qualifying business.  Under current law, a taxpayer cannot
 21 25 claim more than $50,000 of tax credit per investment in a
 21 26 qualifying business, and for each tax year a taxpayer and the
 21 27 taxpayer's affiliates cannot claim tax credits for more than
 21 28 five investments in five different qualifying businesses.  The
 21 29 division amends this dollar limitation to prohibit a natural
 21 30 person and the person's spouse, child, or sibling from claiming
 21 31 a combined amount of more than $100,000 in tax credits per tax
 21 32 year.
 21 33    The division also provides that no more than $500,000 in tax
 21 34 credits may be issued per tax year for equity investments in
 21 35 any one qualifying business.
 22  1 The division modifies the procedures for claiming the tax
 22  2 credit.  Under current law, the tax credit is not refundable
 22  3 but available for carryforward for up to five tax years.  The
 22  4 division makes the tax credit refundable for an investment
 22  5 made by a natural person, and for any other person reduces the
 22  6 carryforward period to three years.
 22  7    The division strikes a provision permitting the EDA
 22  8 to cooperate with small business development centers to
 22  9 disseminate information regarding the credits and to develop
 22 10 standard application forms, and requiring the EDA to distribute
 22 11 copies of the application forms to all community=based seed
 22 12 capital funds and potential individual investors.
 22 13    The division modifies the eligibility requirements for
 22 14 qualifying businesses.  The division strikes the requirement
 22 15 that a business have an owner that meets at least one of
 22 16 four qualifications relating to business education or
 22 17 business experience.  The division requires that a business
 22 18 be participating in an entrepreneurial assistance program,
 22 19 as defined in the division, but allows the EDA to waive this
 22 20 requirement if the business establishes that its owners,
 22 21 directors, officers, and employees have an appropriate level
 22 22 of experience such that an entrepreneurial assistance program
 22 23 would not materially change the prospects of the business.
 22 24 The EDA is allowed to consult with outside service providers
 22 25 in considering such a waiver.  The division increases from $5
 22 26 million to $10 million the maximum amount of net worth that
 22 27 a business may have to be considered a qualifying business.
 22 28 The division increases from $250,000 to $500,000 the amount of
 22 29 financing that a business must have in order to be considered a
 22 30 qualifying business, removes "near equity" from the types of
 22 31 financing that will be considered in that calculation, requires
 22 32 that the financing be secured at the time of application for

 23  1 that submit an application to the EDA to be registered as a
 23  2 qualifying business on or after the effective date of this
 23  3 division of the bill, and businesses that submitted such an
 23  4 application to the EDA before the effective date of this
 23  5 division of the bill shall be governed by current law.
 23  6    The division provides for the confidentiality of certain
 23  7 information with regard to the tax credit.  The identity of
 23  8 a qualifying business, the identity of an investor and the

 23 10 investment, and the total number and amount of tax credits
 23 11 issued shall be considered public information under Code
 23 12 chapter 22 (examination of public records), but any other
 23 13 information or record in the possession of the EDA with respect
 23 14 to the program shall be presumed by the EDA to be a trade secret
 23 15 protected under Code chapter 550 or common law and shall be
 23 16 kept confidential by the EDA unless otherwise ordered by a
 23 17 court.
 23 18    The division takes effect upon enactment and applies to
 23 19 equity investments in a qualifying business made on or after
 23 20 that date.  Equity investments in a qualifying business or
 23 21 community=based seed capital fund made prior to the effective
 23 22 date of the division shall be governed by current law.
 23 23    DIVISION III ==== ENTREPRENEUR INVESTMENT AWARDS PROGRAM.
 23 24  Division III amends the entrepreneur investment awards program
 23 25 administered by the EDA.  The division strikes provisions that
 23 26 prohibited the EDA from making awards under the program since
 23 27 July 1, 2014, and that required the EDA by December 31, 2014,
 23 28 to conduct a comprehensive review of the program and submit
 23 29 a report with specified information to the governor and the
 23 30 general assembly.
 23 31    The division modifies the purpose of the program to be
 23 32 to provide financial assistance to eligible entrepreneurial
 23 33 assistance providers (provider) that provide technical and
 23 34 financial assistance to entrepreneurs and start=up companies
 23 35 seeking to create, locate, or expand a business in Iowa.
 24  1 "Financial assistance" is defined in the division.
 24  2    The division changes the requirements for receiving an
 24  3 award.  To be eligible to receive an award under current
 24  4 law, an entrepreneurial assistance program must have been
 24  5 an Iowa=based business, expended at least $500,000 during
 24  6 the previous fiscal year to provide technical and financial
 24  7 assistance services that meet the broad=based needs of
 24  8 entrepreneurs seeking to create, locate, or expand a business
 24  9 in Iowa that intends to derive more than 10 percent of its
 24 10 gross sales from markets outside Iowa; and must have engaged
 24 11 and communicated with certain other programs, funding sources,
 24 12 and entities for its entrepreneur clients.  The division
 24 13 amends the eligibility for receiving financial assistance to
 24 14 require that a provider have its principal place of operations
 24 15 in Iowa and that the provider offer a comprehensive set of
 24 16 business development services to emerging and early=stage
 24 17 innovation companies to assist in the creation, location,
 24 18 growth, and long=term success of the company in Iowa.
 24 19 "Business development services" is defined in the division.
 24 20 Business development services may be performed at the physical
 24 21 location of the provider or the company and may be provided in
 24 22 consideration of equity participation in the company, a fee for
 24 23 services, or a membership agreement with the company.
 24 24    Under current law, the EDA board could approve, deny, or
 24 25 defer each application for a grant, and was required to award
 24 26 grants on a first=come, first=served basis.  The division
 24 27 specifies that the EDA board has the discretion to approve,
 24 28 deny, or defer each application for financial assistance and
 24 29 that the amount of financial assistance awarded to a provider
 24 30 is within the discretion of the EDA.  The division requires
 24 31 the EDA to award financial assistance on a competitive basis
 24 32 and allows the EDA to develop scoring criteria and establish
 24 33 minimum requirements for the receipt of a financial assistance
 24 34 award.
 24 35    In addition to the four factors relating to the provider's
 25  1 professional staff that the EDA may consider under current
 25  2 law in deciding whether to award financial assistance, the
 25  3 division provides that the EDA may also consider the service
 25  4 model and likelihood of success of the provider, the provider's
 25  5 similarity to other successful providers in the country, and
 25  6 the provider's financial need.
 25  7    The division modifies the maximum award amount for a
 25  8 recipient.  Under current law, a grant to an entrepreneur
 25  9 assistance program cannot exceed the lesser of 25 percent of
 25 10 the funds expended by the program during the previous fiscal
 25 11 year, 100 percent of the funds raised from certain persons
 25 12 by the program during the previous fiscal year, or $200,000.
 25 13 The division provides that the amount of financial assistance
 25 14 awarded to any one provider shall not exceed $200,000.
 25 15    The division modifies the permitted use of funds received
 25 16 under the program.  Under current law, grants are only
 25 17 permitted to be used for the purpose of operating costs
 25 18 incurred by the program.  The division specifies that financial
 25 19 assistance awarded to a provider shall only be used for
 25 20 the purpose of operating costs incurred by the provider in
 25 21 the provision of business development services to emerging
 25 22 and early=stage innovation companies in Iowa.  The division
 25 23 further requires that such financial assistance shall not be
 25 24 distributed to owners or investors of the company to which the
 25 25 business development services are being provided and shall not
 25 26 be provided to other persons assisting with the provision of
 25 27 the services.
 25 28    Under current law, an entrepreneurial assistance provider is
 25 29 required to accept client referrals from the EDA as a condition
 25 30 of receiving a grant.  The division provides that the EDA may
 25 31 make client referrals to eligible providers.
 25 32    DIVISION IV ==== MISCELLANEOUS CHANGES.  Division IV makes
 25 33 several miscellaneous changes to other EDA programs.  The
 25 34 division amends the sales and use tax refund available under
 25 35 the workforce housing tax incentive program.  That refund
 26  1 is available for sales and use tax paid prior to project
 26  2 completion, which is currently defined to mean the first date
 26  3 upon which the average annualized production of finished
 26  4 product for the preceding 90=day period at the manufacturing
 26  5 facility operated by the eligible business is at least 50
 26  6 percent of the initial design capacity of the facility.  The
 26  7 division amends the definition of "project completion" to mean
 26  8 the date on which the EDA notifies the department of revenue
 26  9 that all applicable requirements of a workforce housing tax
 26 10 incentive program agreement are satisfied.  This provision
 26 11 takes effect upon enactment and applies retroactively to July
 26 12 1, 2014, for all workforce housing tax incentive agreements
 26 13 entered into on or after that date.
 26 14    The division allows the EDA to extend the project
 26 15 completion date for a project awarded tax incentives under the
 26 16 redevelopment tax credit program and the housing enterprise
 26 17 zone tax incentives program if the property that is the subject
 26 18 of the project suffered a catastrophic fire during the 2014
 26 19 calendar year.

 21 11 years beginning on or after January 1, 2015.
 21 12    DIVISION II ==== ANGEL INVESTOR TAX CREDITS.   Division II
 21 13 makes several changes to the tax credit for investments in
 21 14 qualifying businesses and community=based seed capital funds,
 21 15 often referred to as the angel investor tax credits.  The
 21 16 division amends the purpose of the tax credit in Code section
 21 17 15E.41.  The division excludes investments in community=based
 21 18 seed capital funds from qualifying for the tax credit and
 21 19 makes several conforming amendments to remove references to
 21 20 community=based seed capital funds from the Code.
 21 21    The division modifies the amount and dollar limitation of
 21 22 the tax credit for a taxpayer.  The tax credit is increased
 21 23 from 20 percent to 25 percent of a taxpayer's equity investment
 21 24 in a qualifying business.  Under current law, a taxpayer cannot
 21 25 claim more than $50,000 of tax credit per investment in a
 21 26 qualifying business, and for each tax year a taxpayer and the
 21 27 taxpayer's affiliates cannot claim tax credits for more than
 21 28 five investments in five different qualifying businesses.  The
 21 29 division amends this dollar limitation to prohibit a natural
 21 30 person and the person's spouse, child, or sibling from claiming
 21 31 a combined amount of more than $100,000 in tax credits per tax
 21 32 year.
 21 33    The division also provides that no more than $500,000 in tax
 21 34 credits may be issued per tax year for equity investments in
 21 35 any one qualifying business.
 22  1 The division modifies the procedures for claiming the tax
 22  2 credit.  Under current law, the tax credit is not refundable
 22  3 but available for carryforward for up to five tax years.  The
 22  4 division makes the tax credit refundable for an investment
 22  5 made by a natural person, and for any other person reduces the
 22  6 carryforward period to three years.
 22  7    The division strikes a provision permitting the EDA
 22  8 to cooperate with small business development centers to
 22  9 disseminate information regarding the credits and to develop
 22 10 standard application forms, and requiring the EDA to distribute
 22 11 copies of the application forms to all community=based seed
 22 12 capital funds and potential individual investors.
 22 13    The division modifies the eligibility requirements for
 22 14 qualifying businesses.  The division strikes the requirement
 22 15 that a business have an owner that meets at least one of
 22 16 four qualifications relating to business education or
 22 17 business experience.  The division requires that a business
 22 18 be participating in an entrepreneurial assistance program,
 22 19 as defined in the division, but allows the EDA to waive this
 22 20 requirement if the business establishes that its owners,
 22 21 directors, officers, and employees have an appropriate level
 22 22 of experience such that an entrepreneurial assistance program
 22 23 would not materially change the prospects of the business.
 22 24 The EDA is allowed to consult with outside service providers
 22 25 in considering such a waiver.  The division increases from $5
 22 26 million to $10 million the maximum amount of net worth that
 22 27 a business may have to be considered a qualifying business.
 22 28 The division increases from $250,000 to $500,000 the amount of
 22 29 financing that a business must have in order to be considered a
 22 30 qualifying business, removes "near equity" from the types of
 22 31 financing that will be considered in that calculation, requires
 22 32 that the financing be secured at the time of application for
 22 33 the tax credits, and requires that the business have at least
 22 34 two investors at the time of application for the tax credits.
 22 35 These modified eligibility requirements apply to businesses
 23  1 that submit an application to the EDA to be registered as a
 23  2 qualifying business on or after the effective date of this
 23  3 division of the bill, and businesses that submitted such an
 23  4 application to the EDA before the effective date of this
 23  5 division of the bill shall be governed by current law.
 23  6    The division provides for the confidentiality of certain
 23  7 information with regard to the tax credit.  The identity of
 23  8 a qualifying business, the identity of an investor and the
 23  9 qualifying business in which the investor made an equity
 23 10 investment, and the total number and amount of tax credits
 23 11 issued shall be considered public information under Code
 23 12 chapter 22 (examination of public records), but any other
 23 13 information or record in the possession of the EDA with respect
 23 14 to the program shall be presumed by the EDA to be a trade secret
 23 15 protected under Code chapter 550 or common law and shall be
 23 16 kept confidential by the EDA unless otherwise ordered by a
 23 17 court.
 23 18    The division takes effect upon enactment and applies to
 23 19 equity investments in a qualifying business made on or after
 23 20 that date.  Equity investments in a qualifying business or
 23 21 community=based seed capital fund made prior to the effective
 23 22 date of the division shall be governed by current law.
 23 23    DIVISION III ==== ENTREPRENEUR INVESTMENT AWARDS PROGRAM.
 23 24  Division III amends the entrepreneur investment awards program
 23 25 administered by the EDA.  The division strikes provisions that
 23 26 prohibited the EDA from making awards under the program since
 23 27 July 1, 2014, and that required the EDA by December 31, 2014,
 23 28 to conduct a comprehensive review of the program and submit
 23 29 a report with specified information to the governor and the
 23 30 general assembly.
 23 31    The division modifies the purpose of the program to be
 23 32 to provide financial assistance to eligible entrepreneurial
 23 33 assistance providers (provider) that provide technical and
 23 34 financial assistance to entrepreneurs and start=up companies
 23 35 seeking to create, locate, or expand a business in Iowa.
 24  1 "Financial assistance" is defined in the division.
 24  2    The division changes the requirements for receiving an
 24  3 award.  To be eligible to receive an award under current
 24  4 law, an entrepreneurial assistance program must have been
 24  5 an Iowa=based business, expended at least $500,000 during
 24  6 the previous fiscal year to provide technical and financial
 24  7 assistance services that meet the broad=based needs of
 24  8 entrepreneurs seeking to create, locate, or expand a business
 24  9 in Iowa that intends to derive more than 10 percent of its
 24 10 gross sales from markets outside Iowa; and must have engaged
 24 11 and communicated with certain other programs, funding sources,
 24 12 and entities for its entrepreneur clients.  The division
 24 13 amends the eligibility for receiving financial assistance to
 24 14 require that a provider have its principal place of operations
 24 15 in Iowa and that the provider offer a comprehensive set of
 24 16 business development services to emerging and early=stage
 24 17 innovation companies to assist in the creation, location,
 24 18 growth, and long=term success of the company in Iowa.
 24 19 "Business development services" is defined in the division.
 24 20 Business development services may be performed at the physical
 24 21 location of the provider or the company and may be provided in
 24 22 consideration of equity participation in the company, a fee for
 24 23 services, or a membership agreement with the company.
 24 24    Under current law, the EDA board could approve, deny, or
 24 25 defer each application for a grant, and was required to award
 24 26 grants on a first=come, first=served basis.  The division
 24 27 specifies that the EDA board has the discretion to approve,
 24 28 deny, or defer each application for financial assistance and
 24 29 that the amount of financial assistance awarded to a provider
 24 30 is within the discretion of the EDA.  The division requires
 24 31 the EDA to award financial assistance on a competitive basis
 24 32 and allows the EDA to develop scoring criteria and establish
 24 33 minimum requirements for the receipt of a financial assistance
 24 34 award.
 24 35    In addition to the four factors relating to the provider's
 25  1 professional staff that the EDA may consider under current
 25  2 law in deciding whether to award financial assistance, the
 25  3 division provides that the EDA may also consider the service
 25  4 model and likelihood of success of the provider, the provider's
 25  5 similarity to other successful providers in the country, and
 25  6 the provider's financial need.
 25  7    The division modifies the maximum award amount for a
 25  8 recipient.  Under current law, a grant to an entrepreneur
 25  9 assistance program cannot exceed the lesser of 25 percent of
 25 10 the funds expended by the program during the previous fiscal
 25 11 year, 100 percent of the funds raised from certain persons
 25 12 by the program during the previous fiscal year, or $200,000.
 25 13 The division provides that the amount of financial assistance
 25 14 awarded to any one provider shall not exceed $200,000.
 25 15    The division modifies the permitted use of funds received
 25 16 under the program.  Under current law, grants are only
 25 17 permitted to be used for the purpose of operating costs
 25 18 incurred by the program.  The division specifies that financial
 25 19 assistance awarded to a provider shall only be used for
 25 20 the purpose of operating costs incurred by the provider in
 25 21 the provision of business development services to emerging
 25 22 and early=stage innovation companies in Iowa.  The division
 25 23 further requires that such financial assistance shall not be
 25 24 distributed to owners or investors of the company to which the
 25 25 business development services are being provided and shall not
 25 26 be provided to other persons assisting with the provision of
 25 27 the services.
 25 28    Under current law, an entrepreneurial assistance provider is
 25 29 required to accept client referrals from the EDA as a condition
 25 30 of receiving a grant.  The division provides that the EDA may
 25 31 make client referrals to eligible providers.
 25 32    DIVISION IV ==== MISCELLANEOUS CHANGES.  Division IV makes
 25 33 several miscellaneous changes to other EDA programs.  The
 25 34 division amends the sales and use tax refund available under
 25 35 the workforce housing tax incentive program.  That refund
 26  1 is available for sales and use tax paid prior to project
 26  2 completion, which is currently defined to mean the first date
 26  3 upon which the average annualized production of finished
 26  4 product for the preceding 90=day period at the manufacturing
 26  5 facility operated by the eligible business is at least 50
 26  6 percent of the initial design capacity of the facility.  The
 26  7 division amends the definition of "project completion" to mean
 26  8 the date on which the EDA notifies the department of revenue
 26  9 that all applicable requirements of a workforce housing tax
 26 10 incentive program agreement are satisfied.  This provision
 26 11 takes effect upon enactment and applies retroactively to July
 26 12 1, 2014, for all workforce housing tax incentive agreements
 26 13 entered into on or after that date.
 26 14    The division allows the EDA to extend the project
 26 15 completion date for a project awarded tax incentives under the
 26 16 redevelopment tax credit program and the housing enterprise
 26 17 zone tax incentives program if the property that is the subject
 26 18 of the project suffered a catastrophic fire during the 2014
 26 19 calendar year.

 21 12    DIVISION II ==== ANGEL INVESTOR TAX CREDITS.   Division II
 21 13 makes several changes to the tax credit for investments in
 21 14 qualifying businesses and community=based seed capital funds,
 21 15 often referred to as the angel investor tax credits.  The
 21 16 division amends the purpose of the tax credit in Code section
 21 17 15E.41.  The division excludes investments in community=based
 21 18 seed capital funds from qualifying for the tax credit and
 21 19 makes several conforming amendments to remove references to
 21 20 community=based seed capital funds from the Code.
 21 21    The division modifies the amount and dollar limitation of
 21 22 the tax credit for a taxpayer.  The tax credit is increased
 21 23 from 20 percent to 25 percent of a taxpayer's equity investment
 21 24 in a qualifying business.  Under current law, a taxpayer cannot
 21 25 claim more than $50,000 of tax credit per investment in a
 21 26 qualifying business, and for each tax year a taxpayer and the
 21 27 taxpayer's affiliates cannot claim tax credits for more than
 21 28 five investments in five different qualifying businesses.  The
 21 29 division amends this dollar limitation to prohibit a natural
 21 30 person and the person's spouse, child, or sibling from claiming
 21 31 a combined amount of more than $100,000 in tax credits per tax
 21 32 year.
 21 33    The division also provides that no more than $500,000 in tax
 21 34 credits may be issued per tax year for equity investments in
 21 35 any one qualifying business.
 22  1 The division modifies the procedures for claiming the tax
 22  2 credit.  Under current law, the tax credit is not refundable
 22  3 but available for carryforward for up to five tax years.  The
 22  4 division makes the tax credit refundable for an investment
 22  5 made by a natural person, and for any other person reduces the
 22  6 carryforward period to three years.
 22  7    The division strikes a provision permitting the EDA
 22  8 to cooperate with small business development centers to
 22  9 disseminate information regarding the credits and to develop
 22 10 standard application forms, and requiring the EDA to distribute
 22 11 copies of the application forms to all community=based seed
 22 12 capital funds and potential individual investors.
 22 13    The division modifies the eligibility requirements for
 22 14 qualifying businesses.  The division strikes the requirement
 22 15 that a business have an owner that meets at least one of
 22 16 four qualifications relating to business education or
 22 17 business experience.  The division requires that a business
 22 18 be participating in an entrepreneurial assistance program,
 22 19 as defined in the division, but allows the EDA to waive this
 22 20 requirement if the business establishes that its owners,
 22 21 directors, officers, and employees have an appropriate level
 22 22 of experience such that an entrepreneurial assistance program
 22 23 would not materially change the prospects of the business.
 22 24 The EDA is allowed to consult with outside service providers
 22 25 in considering such a waiver.  The division increases from $5
 22 26 million to $10 million the maximum amount of net worth that
 22 27 a business may have to be considered a qualifying business.
 22 28 The division increases from $250,000 to $500,000 the amount of
 22 29 financing that a business must have in order to be considered a
 22 30 qualifying business, removes "near equity" from the types of
 22 31 financing that will be considered in that calculation, requires
 22 32 that the financing be secured at the time of application for
 22 33 the tax credits, and requires that the business have at least
 22 34 two investors at the time of application for the tax credits.
 22 35 These modified eligibility requirements apply to businesses
 23  1 that submit an application to the EDA to be registered as a
 23  2 qualifying business on or after the effective date of this
 23  3 division of the bill, and businesses that submitted such an
 23  4 application to the EDA before the effective date of this
 23  5 division of the bill shall be governed by current law.
 23  6    The division provides for the confidentiality of certain
 23  7 information with regard to the tax credit.  The identity of
 23  8 a qualifying business, the identity of an investor and the
 23  9 qualifying business in which the investor made an equity
 23 10 investment, and the total number and amount of tax credits
 23 11 issued shall be considered public information under Code
 23 12 chapter 22 (examination of public records), but any other
 23 13 information or record in the possession of the EDA with respect
 23 14 to the program shall be presumed by the EDA to be a trade secret
 23 15 protected under Code chapter 550 or common law and shall be
 23 16 kept confidential by the EDA unless otherwise ordered by a
 23 17 court.
 23 18    The division takes effect upon enactment and applies to
 23 19 equity investments in a qualifying business made on or after
 23 20 that date.  Equity investments in a qualifying business or
 23 21 community=based seed capital fund made prior to the effective
 23 22 date of the division shall be governed by current law.
 23 23    DIVISION III ==== ENTREPRENEUR INVESTMENT AWARDS PROGRAM.
 23 24  Division III amends the entrepreneur investment awards program
 23 25 administered by the EDA.  The division strikes provisions that
 23 26 prohibited the EDA from making awards under the program since
 23 27 July 1, 2014, and that required the EDA by December 31, 2014,
 23 28 to conduct a comprehensive review of the program and submit
 23 29 a report with specified information to the governor and the
 23 30 general assembly.
 23 31    The division modifies the purpose of the program to be
 23 32 to provide financial assistance to eligible entrepreneurial
 23 33 assistance providers (provider) that provide technical and
 23 34 financial assistance to entrepreneurs and start=up companies
 23 35 seeking to create, locate, or expand a business in Iowa.
 24  1 "Financial assistance" is defined in the division.
 24  2    The division changes the requirements for receiving an
 24  3 award.  To be eligible to receive an award under current
 24  4 law, an entrepreneurial assistance program must have been
 24  5 an Iowa=based business, expended at least $500,000 during
 24  6 the previous fiscal year to provide technical and financial
 24  7 assistance services that meet the broad=based needs of
 24  8 entrepreneurs seeking to create, locate, or expand a business
 24  9 in Iowa that intends to derive more than 10 percent of its
 24 10 gross sales from markets outside Iowa; and must have engaged
 24 11 and communicated with certain other programs, funding sources,
 24 12 and entities for its entrepreneur clients.  The division
 24 13 amends the eligibility for receiving financial assistance to
 24 14 require that a provider have its principal place of operations
 24 15 in Iowa and that the provider offer a comprehensive set of
 24 16 business development services to emerging and early=stage
 24 17 innovation companies to assist in the creation, location,
 24 18 growth, and long=term success of the company in Iowa.
 24 19 "Business development services" is defined in the division.
 24 20 Business development services may be performed at the physical
 24 21 location of the provider or the company and may be provided in
 24 22 consideration of equity participation in the company, a fee for
 24 23 services, or a membership agreement with the company.
 24 24    Under current law, the EDA board could approve, deny, or
 24 25 defer each application for a grant, and was required to award
 24 26 grants on a first=come, first=served basis.  The division
 24 27 specifies that the EDA board has the discretion to approve,
 24 28 deny, or defer each application for financial assistance and
 24 29 that the amount of financial assistance awarded to a provider
 24 30 is within the discretion of the EDA.  The division requires
 24 31 the EDA to award financial assistance on a competitive basis
 24 32 and allows the EDA to develop scoring criteria and establish
 24 33 minimum requirements for the receipt of a financial assistance
 24 34 award.
 24 35    In addition to the four factors relating to the provider's
 25  1 professional staff that the EDA may consider under current
 25  2 law in deciding whether to award financial assistance, the
 25  3 division provides that the EDA may also consider the service
 25  4 model and likelihood of success of the provider, the provider's
 25  5 similarity to other successful providers in the country, and
 25  6 the provider's financial need.
 25  7    The division modifies the maximum award amount for a
 25  8 recipient.  Under current law, a grant to an entrepreneur
 25  9 assistance program cannot exceed the lesser of 25 percent of
 25 10 the funds expended by the program during the previous fiscal
 25 11 year, 100 percent of the funds raised from certain persons
 25 12 by the program during the previous fiscal year, or $200,000.
 25 13 The division provides that the amount of financial assistance
 25 14 awarded to any one provider shall not exceed $200,000.
 25 15    The division modifies the permitted use of funds received
 25 16 under the program.  Under current law, grants are only
 25 17 permitted to be used for the purpose of operating costs
 25 18 incurred by the program.  The division specifies that financial
 25 19 assistance awarded to a provider shall only be used for
 25 20 the purpose of operating costs incurred by the provider in
 25 21 the provision of business development services to emerging
 25 22 and early=stage innovation companies in Iowa.  The division
 25 23 further requires that such financial assistance shall not be
 25 24 distributed to owners or investors of the company to which the
 25 25 business development services are being provided and shall not
 25 26 be provided to other persons assisting with the provision of
 25 27 the services.
 25 28    Under current law, an entrepreneurial assistance provider is
 25 29 required to accept client referrals from the EDA as a condition
 25 30 of receiving a grant.  The division provides that the EDA may
 25 31 make client referrals to eligible providers.
 25 32    DIVISION IV ==== MISCELLANEOUS CHANGES.  Division IV makes
 25 33 several miscellaneous changes to other EDA programs.  The
 25 34 division amends the sales and use tax refund available under
 25 35 the workforce housing tax incentive program.  That refund
 26  1 is available for sales and use tax paid prior to project
 26  2 completion, which is currently defined to mean the first date
 26  3 upon which the average annualized production of finished
 26  4 product for the preceding 90=day period at the manufacturing
 26  5 facility operated by the eligible business is at least 50
 26  6 percent of the initial design capacity of the facility.  The
 26  7 division amends the definition of "project completion" to mean
 26  8 the date on which the EDA notifies the department of revenue
 26  9 that all applicable requirements of a workforce housing tax
 26 10 incentive program agreement are satisfied.  This provision
 26 11 takes effect upon enactment and applies retroactively to July
 26 12 1, 2014, for all workforce housing tax incentive agreements
 26 13 entered into on or after that date.
 26 14    The division allows the EDA to extend the project
 26 15 completion date for a project awarded tax incentives under the
 26 16 redevelopment tax credit program and the housing enterprise
 26 17 zone tax incentives program if the property that is the subject
 26 18 of the project suffered a catastrophic fire during the 2014
 26 19 calendar year.
       LSB 1212HV (3) 86
       mm/sc
 21 13 makes several changes to the tax credit for investments in
 21 14 qualifying businesses and community=based seed capital funds,
 21 15 often referred to as the angel investor tax credits.  The
 21 16 division amends the purpose of the tax credit in Code section
 21 17 15E.41.  The division excludes investments in community=based
 21 18 seed capital funds from qualifying for the tax credit and
 21 19 makes several conforming amendments to remove references to
 21 20 community=based seed capital funds from the Code.
 21 21    The division modifies the amount and dollar limitation of
 21 22 the tax credit for a taxpayer.  The tax credit is increased
 21 23 from 20 percent to 25 percent of a taxpayer's equity investment
 21 24 in a qualifying business.  Under current law, a taxpayer cannot
 21 25 claim more than $50,000 of tax credit per investment in a
 21 26 qualifying business, and for each tax year a taxpayer and the
 21 27 taxpayer's affiliates cannot claim tax credits for more than
 21 28 five investments in five different qualifying businesses.  The
 21 29 division amends this dollar limitation to prohibit a natural
 21 30 person and the person's spouse, child, or sibling from claiming
 21 31 a combined amount of more than $100,000 in tax credits per tax
 21 32 year.
 21 33    The division also provides that no more than $500,000 in tax
 21 34 credits may be issued per tax year for equity investments in
 21 35 any one qualifying business.
 22  1 The division modifies the procedures for claiming the tax
 22  2 credit.  Under current law, the tax credit is not refundable
 22  3 but available for carryforward for up to five tax years.  The
 22  4 division makes the tax credit refundable for an investment
 22  5 made by a natural person, and for any other person reduces the
 22  6 carryforward period to three years.
 22  7    The division strikes a provision permitting the EDA
 22  8 to cooperate with small business development centers to
 22  9 disseminate information regarding the credits and to develop
 22 10 standard application forms, and requiring the EDA to distribute
 22 11 copies of the application forms to all community=based seed
 22 12 capital funds and potential individual investors.
 22 13    The division modifies the eligibility requirements for
 22 14 qualifying businesses.  The division strikes the requirement
 22 15 that a business have an owner that meets at least one of
 22 16 four qualifications relating to business education or
 22 17 business experience.  The division requires that a business
 22 18 be participating in an entrepreneurial assistance program,
 22 19 as defined in the division, but allows the EDA to waive this
 22 20 requirement if the business establishes that its owners,
 22 21 directors, officers, and employees have an appropriate level
 22 22 of experience such that an entrepreneurial assistance program
 22 23 would not materially change the prospects of the business.
 22 24 The EDA is allowed to consult with outside service providers
 22 25 in considering such a waiver.  The division increases from $5
 22 26 million to $10 million the maximum amount of net worth that
 22 27 a business may have to be considered a qualifying business.
 22 28 The division increases from $250,000 to $500,000 the amount of
 22 29 financing that a business must have in order to be considered a
 22 30 qualifying business, removes "near equity" from the types of
 22 31 financing that will be considered in that calculation, requires
 22 32 that the financing be secured at the time of application for
 22 33 the tax credits, and requires that the business have at least
 22 34 two investors at the time of application for the tax credits.
 22 35 These modified eligibility requirements apply to businesses
 23  1 that submit an application to the EDA to be registered as a
 23  2 qualifying business on or after the effective date of this
 23  3 division of the bill, and businesses that submitted such an
 23  4 application to the EDA before the effective date of this
 23  5 division of the bill shall be governed by current law.
 23  6    The division provides for the confidentiality of certain
 23  7 information with regard to the tax credit.  The identity of
 23  8 a qualifying business, the identity of an investor and the
 23  9 qualifying business in which the investor made an equity
 23 10 investment, and the total number and amount of tax credits
 23 11 issued shall be considered public information under Code
 23 12 chapter 22 (examination of public records), but any other
 23 13 information or record in the possession of the EDA with respect
 23 14 to the program shall be presumed by the EDA to be a trade secret
 23 15 protected under Code chapter 550 or common law and shall be
 23 16 kept confidential by the EDA unless otherwise ordered by a
 23 17 court.
 23 18    The division takes effect upon enactment and applies to
 23 19 equity investments in a qualifying business made on or after
 23 20 that date.  Equity investments in a qualifying business or
 23 21 community=based seed capital fund made prior to the effective
 23 22 date of the division shall be governed by current law.
 23 23    DIVISION III ==== ENTREPRENEUR INVESTMENT AWARDS PROGRAM.
 23 24  Division III amends the entrepreneur investment awards program
 23 25 administered by the EDA.  The division strikes provisions that
 23 26 prohibited the EDA from making awards under the program since
 23 27 July 1, 2014, and that required the EDA by December 31, 2014,
 23 28 to conduct a comprehensive review of the program and submit
 23 29 a report with specified information to the governor and the
 23 30 general assembly.
 23 31    The division modifies the purpose of the program to be
 23 32 to provide financial assistance to eligible entrepreneurial
 23 33 assistance providers (provider) that provide technical and
 23 34 financial assistance to entrepreneurs and start=up companies
 23 35 seeking to create, locate, or expand a business in Iowa.
 24  1 "Financial assistance" is defined in the division.
 24  2    The division changes the requirements for receiving an
 24  3 award.  To be eligible to receive an award under current
 24  4 law, an entrepreneurial assistance program must have been
 24  5 an Iowa=based business, expended at least $500,000 during
 24  6 the previous fiscal year to provide technical and financial
 24  7 assistance services that meet the broad=based needs of
 24  8 entrepreneurs seeking to create, locate, or expand a business
 24  9 in Iowa that intends to derive more than 10 percent of its
 24 10 gross sales from markets outside Iowa; and must have engaged
 24 11 and communicated with certain other programs, funding sources,
 24 12 and entities for its entrepreneur clients.  The division
 24 13 amends the eligibility for receiving financial assistance to
 24 14 require that a provider have its principal place of operations
 24 15 in Iowa and that the provider offer a comprehensive set of
 24 16 business development services to emerging and early=stage
 24 17 innovation companies to assist in the creation, location,
 24 18 growth, and long=term success of the company in Iowa.
 24 19 "Business development services" is defined in the division.
 24 20 Business development services may be performed at the physical
 24 21 location of the provider or the company and may be provided in
 24 22 consideration of equity participation in the company, a fee for
 24 23 services, or a membership agreement with the company.
 24 24    Under current law, the EDA board could approve, deny, or
 24 25 defer each application for a grant, and was required to award
 24 26 grants on a first=come, first=served basis.  The division
 24 27 specifies that the EDA board has the discretion to approve,
 24 28 deny, or defer each application for financial assistance and
 24 29 that the amount of financial assistance awarded to a provider
 24 30 is within the discretion of the EDA.  The division requires
 24 31 the EDA to award financial assistance on a competitive basis
 24 32 and allows the EDA to develop scoring criteria and establish
 24 33 minimum requirements for the receipt of a financial assistance
 24 34 award.
 24 35    In addition to the four factors relating to the provider's
 25  1 professional staff that the EDA may consider under current
 25  2 law in deciding whether to award financial assistance, the
 25  3 division provides that the EDA may also consider the service
 25  4 model and likelihood of success of the provider, the provider's
 25  5 similarity to other successful providers in the country, and
 25  6 the provider's financial need.
 25  7    The division modifies the maximum award amount for a
 25  8 recipient.  Under current law, a grant to an entrepreneur
 25  9 assistance program cannot exceed the lesser of 25 percent of
 25 10 the funds expended by the program during the previous fiscal
 25 11 year, 100 percent of the funds raised from certain persons
 25 12 by the program during the previous fiscal year, or $200,000.
 25 13 The division provides that the amount of financial assistance
 25 14 awarded to any one provider shall not exceed $200,000.
 25 15    The division modifies the permitted use of funds received
 25 16 under the program.  Under current law, grants are only
 25 17 permitted to be used for the purpose of operating costs
 25 18 incurred by the program.  The division specifies that financial
 25 19 assistance awarded to a provider shall only be used for
 25 20 the purpose of operating costs incurred by the provider in
 25 21 the provision of business development services to emerging
 25 22 and early=stage innovation companies in Iowa.  The division
 25 23 further requires that such financial assistance shall not be
 25 24 distributed to owners or investors of the company to which the
 25 25 business development services are being provided and shall not
 25 26 be provided to other persons assisting with the provision of
 25 27 the services.
 25 28    Under current law, an entrepreneurial assistance provider is
 25 29 required to accept client referrals from the EDA as a condition
 25 30 of receiving a grant.  The division provides that the EDA may
 25 31 make client referrals to eligible providers.
 25 32    DIVISION IV ==== MISCELLANEOUS CHANGES.  Division IV makes
 25 33 several miscellaneous changes to other EDA programs.  The
 25 34 division amends the sales and use tax refund available under
 25 35 the workforce housing tax incentive program.  That refund
 26  1 is available for sales and use tax paid prior to project
 26  2 completion, which is currently defined to mean the first date
 26  3 upon which the average annualized production of finished
 26  4 product for the preceding 90=day period at the manufacturing
 26  5 facility operated by the eligible business is at least 50
 26  6 percent of the initial design capacity of the facility.  The
 26  7 division amends the definition of "project completion" to mean
 26  8 the date on which the EDA notifies the department of revenue
 26  9 that all applicable requirements of a workforce housing tax
 26 10 incentive program agreement are satisfied.  This provision
 26 11 takes effect upon enactment and applies retroactively to July
 26 12 1, 2014, for all workforce housing tax incentive agreements
 26 13 entered into on or after that date.
 26 14    The division allows the EDA to extend the project
 26 15 completion date for a project awarded tax incentives under the
 26 16 redevelopment tax credit program and the housing enterprise
 26 17 zone tax incentives program if the property that is the subject
 26 18 of the project suffered a catastrophic fire during the 2014
 26 19 calendar year.
       LSB 1212HV (3) 86
       mm/sc
 21 14 qualifying businesses and community=based seed capital funds,
 21 15 often referred to as the angel investor tax credits.  The
 21 16 division amends the purpose of the tax credit in Code section
 21 17 15E.41.  The division excludes investments in community=based
 21 18 seed capital funds from qualifying for the tax credit and
 21 19 makes several conforming amendments to remove references to
 21 20 community=based seed capital funds from the Code.
 21 21    The division modifies the amount and dollar limitation of
 21 22 the tax credit for a taxpayer.  The tax credit is increased
 21 23 from 20 percent to 25 percent of a taxpayer's equity investment
 21 24 in a qualifying business.  Under current law, a taxpayer cannot
 21 25 claim more than $50,000 of tax credit per investment in a
 21 26 qualifying business, and for each tax year a taxpayer and the
 21 27 taxpayer's affiliates cannot claim tax credits for more than
 21 28 five investments in five different qualifying businesses.  The
 21 29 division amends this dollar limitation to prohibit a natural
 21 30 person and the person's spouse, child, or sibling from claiming
 21 31 a combined amount of more than $100,000 in tax credits per tax
 21 32 year.
 21 33    The division also provides that no more than $500,000 in tax
 21 34 credits may be issued per tax year for equity investments in
 21 35 any one qualifying business.
 22  1 The division modifies the procedures for claiming the tax
 22  2 credit.  Under current law, the tax credit is not refundable
 22  3 but available for carryforward for up to five tax years.  The
 22  4 division makes the tax credit refundable for an investment
 22  5 made by a natural person, and for any other person reduces the
 22  6 carryforward period to three years.
 22  7    The division strikes a provision permitting the EDA
 22  8 to cooperate with small business development centers to
 22  9 disseminate information regarding the credits and to develop
 22 10 standard application forms, and requiring the EDA to distribute
 22 11 copies of the application forms to all community=based seed
 22 12 capital funds and potential individual investors.
 22 13    The division modifies the eligibility requirements for
 22 14 qualifying businesses.  The division strikes the requirement
 22 15 that a business have an owner that meets at least one of
 22 16 four qualifications relating to business education or
 22 17 business experience.  The division requires that a business
 22 18 be participating in an entrepreneurial assistance program,
 22 19 as defined in the division, but allows the EDA to waive this
 22 20 requirement if the business establishes that its owners,
 22 21 directors, officers, and employees have an appropriate level
 22 22 of experience such that an entrepreneurial assistance program
 22 23 would not materially change the prospects of the business.
 22 24 The EDA is allowed to consult with outside service providers
 22 25 in considering such a waiver.  The division increases from $5
 22 26 million to $10 million the maximum amount of net worth that
 22 27 a business may have to be considered a qualifying business.
 22 28 The division increases from $250,000 to $500,000 the amount of
 22 29 financing that a business must have in order to be considered a
 22 30 qualifying business, removes "near equity" from the types of
 22 31 financing that will be considered in that calculation, requires
 22 32 that the financing be secured at the time of application for
 22 33 the tax credits, and requires that the business have at least
 22 34 two investors at the time of application for the tax credits.
 22 35 These modified eligibility requirements apply to businesses
 23  1 that submit an application to the EDA to be registered as a
 23  2 qualifying business on or after the effective date of this
 23  3 division of the bill, and businesses that submitted such an
 23  4 application to the EDA before the effective date of this
 23  5 division of the bill shall be governed by current law.
 23  6    The division provides for the confidentiality of certain
 23  7 information with regard to the tax credit.  The identity of
 23  8 a qualifying business, the identity of an investor and the
 23  9 qualifying business in which the investor made an equity
 23 10 investment, and the total number and amount of tax credits
 23 11 issued shall be considered public information under Code
 23 12 chapter 22 (examination of public records), but any other
 23 13 information or record in the possession of the EDA with respect
 23 14 to the program shall be presumed by the EDA to be a trade secret
 23 15 protected under Code chapter 550 or common law and shall be
 23 16 kept confidential by the EDA unless otherwise ordered by a
 23 17 court.
 23 18    The division takes effect upon enactment and applies to
 23 19 equity investments in a qualifying business made on or after
 23 20 that date.  Equity investments in a qualifying business or
 23 21 community=based seed capital fund made prior to the effective
 23 22 date of the division shall be governed by current law.
 23 23    DIVISION III ==== ENTREPRENEUR INVESTMENT AWARDS PROGRAM.
 23 24  Division III amends the entrepreneur investment awards program
 23 25 administered by the EDA.  The division strikes provisions that
 23 26 prohibited the EDA from making awards under the program since
 23 27 July 1, 2014, and that required the EDA by December 31, 2014,
 23 28 to conduct a comprehensive review of the program and submit
 23 29 a report with specified information to the governor and the
 23 30 general assembly.
 23 31    The division modifies the purpose of the program to be
 23 32 to provide financial assistance to eligible entrepreneurial
 23 33 assistance providers (provider) that provide technical and
 23 34 financial assistance to entrepreneurs and start=up companies
 23 35 seeking to create, locate, or expand a business in Iowa.
 24  1 "Financial assistance" is defined in the division.
 24  2    The division changes the requirements for receiving an
 24  3 award.  To be eligible to receive an award under current
 24  4 law, an entrepreneurial assistance program must have been
 24  5 an Iowa=based business, expended at least $500,000 during
 24  6 the previous fiscal year to provide technical and financial
 24  7 assistance services that meet the broad=based needs of
 24  8 entrepreneurs seeking to create, locate, or expand a business
 24  9 in Iowa that intends to derive more than 10 percent of its
 24 10 gross sales from markets outside Iowa; and must have engaged
 24 11 and communicated with certain other programs, funding sources,
 24 12 and entities for its entrepreneur clients.  The division
 24 13 amends the eligibility for receiving financial assistance to
 24 14 require that a provider have its principal place of operations
 24 15 in Iowa and that the provider offer a comprehensive set of
 24 16 business development services to emerging and early=stage
 24 17 innovation companies to assist in the creation, location,
 24 18 growth, and long=term success of the company in Iowa.
 24 19 "Business development services" is defined in the division.
 24 20 Business development services may be performed at the physical
 24 21 location of the provider or the company and may be provided in
 24 22 consideration of equity participation in the company, a fee for
 24 23 services, or a membership agreement with the company.
 24 24    Under current law, the EDA board could approve, deny, or
 24 25 defer each application for a grant, and was required to award
 24 26 grants on a first=come, first=served basis.  The division
 24 27 specifies that the EDA board has the discretion to approve,
 24 28 deny, or defer each application for financial assistance and
 24 29 that the amount of financial assistance awarded to a provider
 24 30 is within the discretion of the EDA.  The division requires
 24 31 the EDA to award financial assistance on a competitive basis
 24 32 and allows the EDA to develop scoring criteria and establish
 24 33 minimum requirements for the receipt of a financial assistance
 24 34 award.
 24 35    In addition to the four factors relating to the provider's
 25  1 professional staff that the EDA may consider under current
 25  2 law in deciding whether to award financial assistance, the
 25  3 division provides that the EDA may also consider the service
 25  4 model and likelihood of success of the provider, the provider's
 25  5 similarity to other successful providers in the country, and
 25  6 the provider's financial need.
 25  7    The division modifies the maximum award amount for a
 25  8 recipient.  Under current law, a grant to an entrepreneur
 25  9 assistance program cannot exceed the lesser of 25 percent of
 25 10 the funds expended by the program during the previous fiscal
 25 11 year, 100 percent of the funds raised from certain persons
 25 12 by the program during the previous fiscal year, or $200,000.
 25 13 The division provides that the amount of financial assistance
 25 14 awarded to any one provider shall not exceed $200,000.
 25 15    The division modifies the permitted use of funds received
 25 16 under the program.  Under current law, grants are only
 25 17 permitted to be used for the purpose of operating costs
 25 18 incurred by the program.  The division specifies that financial
 25 19 assistance awarded to a provider shall only be used for
 25 20 the purpose of operating costs incurred by the provider in
 25 21 the provision of business development services to emerging
 25 22 and early=stage innovation companies in Iowa.  The division
 25 23 further requires that such financial assistance shall not be
 25 24 distributed to owners or investors of the company to which the
 25 25 business development services are being provided and shall not
 25 26 be provided to other persons assisting with the provision of
 25 27 the services.
 25 28    Under current law, an entrepreneurial assistance provider is
 25 29 required to accept client referrals from the EDA as a condition
 25 30 of receiving a grant.  The division provides that the EDA may
 25 31 make client referrals to eligible providers.
 25 32    DIVISION IV ==== MISCELLANEOUS CHANGES.  Division IV makes
 25 33 several miscellaneous changes to other EDA programs.  The
 25 34 division amends the sales and use tax refund available under
 25 35 the workforce housing tax incentive program.  That refund
 26  1 is available for sales and use tax paid prior to project
 26  2 completion, which is currently defined to mean the first date
 26  3 upon which the average annualized production of finished
 26  4 product for the preceding 90=day period at the manufacturing
 26  5 facility operated by the eligible business is at least 50
 26  6 percent of the initial design capacity of the facility.  The
 26  7 division amends the definition of "project completion" to mean
 26  8 the date on which the EDA notifies the department of revenue
 26  9 that all applicable requirements of a workforce housing tax
 26 10 incentive program agreement are satisfied.  This provision
 26 11 takes effect upon enactment and applies retroactively to July
 26 12 1, 2014, for all workforce housing tax incentive agreements
 26 13 entered into on or after that date.
 26 14    The division allows the EDA to extend the project
 26 15 completion date for a project awarded tax incentives under the
 26 16 redevelopment tax credit program and the housing enterprise
 26 17 zone tax incentives program if the property that is the subject
 26 18 of the project suffered a catastrophic fire during the 2014
 26 19 calendar year.
       LSB 1212HV (3) 86
       mm/sc
 21 15 often referred to as the angel investor tax credits.  The
 21 16 division amends the purpose of the tax credit in Code section
 21 17 15E.41.  The division excludes investments in community=based
 21 18 seed capital funds from qualifying for the tax credit and
 21 19 makes several conforming amendments to remove references to
 21 20 community=based seed capital funds from the Code.
 21 21    The division modifies the amount and dollar limitation of
 21 22 the tax credit for a taxpayer.  The tax credit is increased
 21 23 from 20 percent to 25 percent of a taxpayer's equity investment
 21 24 in a qualifying business.  Under current law, a taxpayer cannot
 21 25 claim more than $50,000 of tax credit per investment in a
 21 26 qualifying business, and for each tax year a taxpayer and the
 21 27 taxpayer's affiliates cannot claim tax credits for more than
 21 28 five investments in five different qualifying businesses.  The
 21 29 division amends this dollar limitation to prohibit a natural
 21 30 person and the person's spouse, child, or sibling from claiming
 21 31 a combined amount of more than $100,000 in tax credits per tax
 21 32 year.
 21 33    The division also provides that no more than $500,000 in tax
 21 34 credits may be issued per tax year for equity investments in
 21 35 any one qualifying business.
 22  1 The division modifies the procedures for claiming the tax
 22  2 credit.  Under current law, the tax credit is not refundable
 22  3 but available for carryforward for up to five tax years.  The
 22  4 division makes the tax credit refundable for an investment
 22  5 made by a natural person, and for any other person reduces the
 22  6 carryforward period to three years.
 22  7    The division strikes a provision permitting the EDA
 22  8 to cooperate with small business development centers to
 22  9 disseminate information regarding the credits and to develop
 22 10 standard application forms, and requiring the EDA to distribute
 22 11 copies of the application forms to all community=based seed
 22 12 capital funds and potential individual investors.
 22 13    The division modifies the eligibility requirements for
 22 14 qualifying businesses.  The division strikes the requirement
 22 15 that a business have an owner that meets at least one of
 22 16 four qualifications relating to business education or
 22 17 business experience.  The division requires that a business
 22 18 be participating in an entrepreneurial assistance program,
 22 19 as defined in the division, but allows the EDA to waive this
 22 20 requirement if the business establishes that its owners,
 22 21 directors, officers, and employees have an appropriate level
 22 22 of experience such that an entrepreneurial assistance program
 22 23 would not materially change the prospects of the business.
 22 24 The EDA is allowed to consult with outside service providers
 22 25 in considering such a waiver.  The division increases from $5
 22 26 million to $10 million the maximum amount of net worth that
 22 27 a business may have to be considered a qualifying business.
 22 28 The division increases from $250,000 to $500,000 the amount of
 22 29 financing that a business must have in order to be considered a
 22 30 qualifying business, removes "near equity" from the types of
 22 31 financing that will be considered in that calculation, requires
 22 32 that the financing be secured at the time of application for
 22 33 the tax credits, and requires that the business have at least
 22 34 two investors at the time of application for the tax credits.
 22 35 These modified eligibility requirements apply to businesses
 23  1 that submit an application to the EDA to be registered as a
 23  2 qualifying business on or after the effective date of this
 23  3 division of the bill, and businesses that submitted such an
 23  4 application to the EDA before the effective date of this
 23  5 division of the bill shall be governed by current law.
 23  6    The division provides for the confidentiality of certain
 23  7 information with regard to the tax credit.  The identity of
 23  8 a qualifying business, the identity of an investor and the
 23  9 qualifying business in which the investor made an equity
 23 10 investment, and the total number and amount of tax credits
 23 11 issued shall be considered public information under Code
 23 12 chapter 22 (examination of public records), but any other
 23 13 information or record in the possession of the EDA with respect
 23 14 to the program shall be presumed by the EDA to be a trade secret
 23 15 protected under Code chapter 550 or common law and shall be
 23 16 kept confidential by the EDA unless otherwise ordered by a
 23 17 court.
 23 18    The division takes effect upon enactment and applies to
 23 19 equity investments in a qualifying business made on or after
 23 20 that date.  Equity investments in a qualifying business or
 23 21 community=based seed capital fund made prior to the effective
 23 22 date of the division shall be governed by current law.
 23 23    DIVISION III ==== ENTREPRENEUR INVESTMENT AWARDS PROGRAM.
 23 24  Division III amends the entrepreneur investment awards program
 23 25 administered by the EDA.  The division strikes provisions that
 23 26 prohibited the EDA from making awards under the program since
 23 27 July 1, 2014, and that required the EDA by December 31, 2014,
 23 28 to conduct a comprehensive review of the program and submit
 23 29 a report with specified information to the governor and the
 23 30 general assembly.
 23 31    The division modifies the purpose of the program to be
 23 32 to provide financial assistance to eligible entrepreneurial
 23 33 assistance providers (provider) that provide technical and
 23 34 financial assistance to entrepreneurs and start=up companies
 23 35 seeking to create, locate, or expand a business in Iowa.
 24  1 "Financial assistance" is defined in the division.
 24  2    The division changes the requirements for receiving an
 24  3 award.  To be eligible to receive an award under current
 24  4 law, an entrepreneurial assistance program must have been
 24  5 an Iowa=based business, expended at least $500,000 during
 24  6 the previous fiscal year to provide technical and financial
 24  7 assistance services that meet the broad=based needs of
 24  8 entrepreneurs seeking to create, locate, or expand a business
 24  9 in Iowa that intends to derive more than 10 percent of its
 24 10 gross sales from markets outside Iowa; and must have engaged
 24 11 and communicated with certain other programs, funding sources,
 24 12 and entities for its entrepreneur clients.  The division
 24 13 amends the eligibility for receiving financial assistance to
 24 14 require that a provider have its principal place of operations
 24 15 in Iowa and that the provider offer a comprehensive set of
 24 16 business development services to emerging and early=stage
 24 17 innovation companies to assist in the creation, location,
 24 18 growth, and long=term success of the company in Iowa.
 24 19 "Business development services" is defined in the division.
 24 20 Business development services may be performed at the physical
 24 21 location of the provider or the company and may be provided in
 24 22 consideration of equity participation in the company, a fee for
 24 23 services, or a membership agreement with the company.
 24 24    Under current law, the EDA board could approve, deny, or
 24 25 defer each application for a grant, and was required to award
 24 26 grants on a first=come, first=served basis.  The division
 24 27 specifies that the EDA board has the discretion to approve,
 24 28 deny, or defer each application for financial assistance and
 24 29 that the amount of financial assistance awarded to a provider
 24 30 is within the discretion of the EDA.  The division requires
 24 31 the EDA to award financial assistance on a competitive basis
 24 32 and allows the EDA to develop scoring criteria and establish
 24 33 minimum requirements for the receipt of a financial assistance
 24 34 award.
 24 35    In addition to the four factors relating to the provider's
 25  1 professional staff that the EDA may consider under current
 25  2 law in deciding whether to award financial assistance, the
 25  3 division provides that the EDA may also consider the service
 25  4 model and likelihood of success of the provider, the provider's
 25  5 similarity to other successful providers in the country, and
 25  6 the provider's financial need.
 25  7    The division modifies the maximum award amount for a
 25  8 recipient.  Under current law, a grant to an entrepreneur
 25  9 assistance program cannot exceed the lesser of 25 percent of
 25 10 the funds expended by the program during the previous fiscal
 25 11 year, 100 percent of the funds raised from certain persons
 25 12 by the program during the previous fiscal year, or $200,000.
 25 13 The division provides that the amount of financial assistance
 25 14 awarded to any one provider shall not exceed $200,000.
 25 15    The division modifies the permitted use of funds received
 25 16 under the program.  Under current law, grants are only
 25 17 permitted to be used for the purpose of operating costs
 25 18 incurred by the program.  The division specifies that financial
 25 19 assistance awarded to a provider shall only be used for
 25 20 the purpose of operating costs incurred by the provider in
 25 21 the provision of business development services to emerging
 25 22 and early=stage innovation companies in Iowa.  The division
 25 23 further requires that such financial assistance shall not be
 25 24 distributed to owners or investors of the company to which the
 25 25 business development services are being provided and shall not
 25 26 be provided to other persons assisting with the provision of
 25 27 the services.
 25 28    Under current law, an entrepreneurial assistance provider is
 25 29 required to accept client referrals from the EDA as a condition
 25 30 of receiving a grant.  The division provides that the EDA may
 25 31 make client referrals to eligible providers.
 25 32    DIVISION IV ==== MISCELLANEOUS CHANGES.  Division IV makes
 25 33 several miscellaneous changes to other EDA programs.  The
 25 34 division amends the sales and use tax refund available under
 25 35 the workforce housing tax incentive program.  That refund
 26  1 is available for sales and use tax paid prior to project
 26  2 completion, which is currently defined to mean the first date
 26  3 upon which the average annualized production of finished
 26  4 product for the preceding 90=day period at the manufacturing
 26  5 facility operated by the eligible business is at least 50
 26  6 percent of the initial design capacity of the facility.  The
 26  7 division amends the definition of "project completion" to mean
 26  8 the date on which the EDA notifies the department of revenue
 26  9 that all applicable requirements of a workforce housing tax
 26 10 incentive program agreement are satisfied.  This provision
 26 11 takes effect upon enactment and applies retroactively to July
 26 12 1, 2014, for all workforce housing tax incentive agreements
 26 13 entered into on or after that date.
 26 14    The division allows the EDA to extend the project
 26 15 completion date for a project awarded tax incentives under the
 26 16 redevelopment tax credit program and the housing enterprise
 26 17 zone tax incentives program if the property that is the subject
 26 18 of the project suffered a catastrophic fire during the 2014
 26 19 calendar year.
       LSB 1212HV (3) 86
       mm/sc
 21 16 division amends the purpose of the tax credit in Code section
 21 17 15E.41.  The division excludes investments in community=based
 21 18 seed capital funds from qualifying for the tax credit and
 21 19 makes several conforming amendments to remove references to
 21 20 community=based seed capital funds from the Code.
 21 21    The division modifies the amount and dollar limitation of
 21 22 the tax credit for a taxpayer.  The tax credit is increased
 21 23 from 20 percent to 25 percent of a taxpayer's equity investment
 21 24 in a qualifying business.  Under current law, a taxpayer cannot
 21 25 claim more than $50,000 of tax credit per investment in a
 21 26 qualifying business, and for each tax year a taxpayer and the
 21 27 taxpayer's affiliates cannot claim tax credits for more than
 21 28 five investments in five different qualifying businesses.  The
 21 29 division amends this dollar limitation to prohibit a natural
 21 30 person and the person's spouse, child, or sibling from claiming
 21 31 a combined amount of more than $100,000 in tax credits per tax
 21 32 year.
 21 33    The division also provides that no more than $500,000 in tax
 21 34 credits may be issued per tax year for equity investments in
 21 35 any one qualifying business.
 22  1 The division modifies the procedures for claiming the tax
 22  2 credit.  Under current law, the tax credit is not refundable
 22  3 but available for carryforward for up to five tax years.  The
 22  4 division makes the tax credit refundable for an investment
 22  5 made by a natural person, and for any other person reduces the
 22  6 carryforward period to three years.
 22  7    The division strikes a provision permitting the EDA
 22  8 to cooperate with small business development centers to
 22  9 disseminate information regarding the credits and to develop
 22 10 standard application forms, and requiring the EDA to distribute
 22 11 copies of the application forms to all community=based seed
 22 12 capital funds and potential individual investors.
 22 13    The division modifies the eligibility requirements for
 22 14 qualifying businesses.  The division strikes the requirement
 22 15 that a business have an owner that meets at least one of
 22 16 four qualifications relating to business education or
 22 17 business experience.  The division requires that a business
 22 18 be participating in an entrepreneurial assistance program,
 22 19 as defined in the division, but allows the EDA to waive this
 22 20 requirement if the business establishes that its owners,
 22 21 directors, officers, and employees have an appropriate level
 22 22 of experience such that an entrepreneurial assistance program
 22 23 would not materially change the prospects of the business.
 22 24 The EDA is allowed to consult with outside service providers
 22 25 in considering such a waiver.  The division increases from $5
 22 26 million to $10 million the maximum amount of net worth that
 22 27 a business may have to be considered a qualifying business.
 22 28 The division increases from $250,000 to $500,000 the amount of
 22 29 financing that a business must have in order to be considered a
 22 30 qualifying business, removes "near equity" from the types of
 22 31 financing that will be considered in that calculation, requires
 22 32 that the financing be secured at the time of application for
 22 33 the tax credits, and requires that the business have at least
 22 34 two investors at the time of application for the tax credits.
 22 35 These modified eligibility requirements apply to businesses
 23  1 that submit an application to the EDA to be registered as a
 23  2 qualifying business on or after the effective date of this
 23  3 division of the bill, and businesses that submitted such an
 23  4 application to the EDA before the effective date of this
 23  5 division of the bill shall be governed by current law.
 23  6    The division provides for the confidentiality of certain
 23  7 information with regard to the tax credit.  The identity of
 23  8 a qualifying business, the identity of an investor and the
 23  9 qualifying business in which the investor made an equity
 23 10 investment, and the total number and amount of tax credits
 23 11 issued shall be considered public information under Code
 23 12 chapter 22 (examination of public records), but any other
 23 13 information or record in the possession of the EDA with respect
 23 14 to the program shall be presumed by the EDA to be a trade secret
 23 15 protected under Code chapter 550 or common law and shall be
 23 16 kept confidential by the EDA unless otherwise ordered by a
 23 17 court.
 23 18    The division takes effect upon enactment and applies to
 23 19 equity investments in a qualifying business made on or after
 23 20 that date.  Equity investments in a qualifying business or
 23 21 community=based seed capital fund made prior to the effective
 23 22 date of the division shall be governed by current law.
 23 23    DIVISION III ==== ENTREPRENEUR INVESTMENT AWARDS PROGRAM.
 23 24  Division III amends the entrepreneur investment awards program
 23 25 administered by the EDA.  The division strikes provisions that
 23 26 prohibited the EDA from making awards under the program since
 23 27 July 1, 2014, and that required the EDA by December 31, 2014,
 23 28 to conduct a comprehensive review of the program and submit
 23 29 a report with specified information to the governor and the
 23 30 general assembly.
 23 31    The division modifies the purpose of the program to be
 23 32 to provide financial assistance to eligible entrepreneurial
 23 33 assistance providers (provider) that provide technical and
 23 34 financial assistance to entrepreneurs and start=up companies
 23 35 seeking to create, locate, or expand a business in Iowa.
 24  1 "Financial assistance" is defined in the division.
 24  2    The division changes the requirements for receiving an
 24  3 award.  To be eligible to receive an award under current
 24  4 law, an entrepreneurial assistance program must have been
 24  5 an Iowa=based business, expended at least $500,000 during
 24  6 the previous fiscal year to provide technical and financial
 24  7 assistance services that meet the broad=based needs of
 24  8 entrepreneurs seeking to create, locate, or expand a business
 24  9 in Iowa that intends to derive more than 10 percent of its
 24 10 gross sales from markets outside Iowa; and must have engaged
 24 11 and communicated with certain other programs, funding sources,
 24 12 and entities for its entrepreneur clients.  The division
 24 13 amends the eligibility for receiving financial assistance to
 24 14 require that a provider have its principal place of operations
 24 15 in Iowa and that the provider offer a comprehensive set of
 24 16 business development services to emerging and early=stage
 24 17 innovation companies to assist in the creation, location,
 24 18 growth, and long=term success of the company in Iowa.
 24 19 "Business development services" is defined in the division.
 24 20 Business development services may be performed at the physical
 24 21 location of the provider or the company and may be provided in
 24 22 consideration of equity participation in the company, a fee for
 24 23 services, or a membership agreement with the company.
 24 24    Under current law, the EDA board could approve, deny, or
 24 25 defer each application for a grant, and was required to award
 24 26 grants on a first=come, first=served basis.  The division
 24 27 specifies that the EDA board has the discretion to approve,
 24 28 deny, or defer each application for financial assistance and
 24 29 that the amount of financial assistance awarded to a provider
 24 30 is within the discretion of the EDA.  The division requires
 24 31 the EDA to award financial assistance on a competitive basis
 24 32 and allows the EDA to develop scoring criteria and establish
 24 33 minimum requirements for the receipt of a financial assistance
 24 34 award.
 24 35    In addition to the four factors relating to the provider's
 25  1 professional staff that the EDA may consider under current
 25  2 law in deciding whether to award financial assistance, the
 25  3 division provides that the EDA may also consider the service
 25  4 model and likelihood of success of the provider, the provider's
 25  5 similarity to other successful providers in the country, and
 25  6 the provider's financial need.
 25  7    The division modifies the maximum award amount for a
 25  8 recipient.  Under current law, a grant to an entrepreneur
 25  9 assistance program cannot exceed the lesser of 25 percent of
 25 10 the funds expended by the program during the previous fiscal
 25 11 year, 100 percent of the funds raised from certain persons
 25 12 by the program during the previous fiscal year, or $200,000.
 25 13 The division provides that the amount of financial assistance
 25 14 awarded to any one provider shall not exceed $200,000.
 25 15    The division modifies the permitted use of funds received
 25 16 under the program.  Under current law, grants are only
 25 17 permitted to be used for the purpose of operating costs
 25 18 incurred by the program.  The division specifies that financial
 25 19 assistance awarded to a provider shall only be used for
 25 20 the purpose of operating costs incurred by the provider in
 25 21 the provision of business development services to emerging
 25 22 and early=stage innovation companies in Iowa.  The division
 25 23 further requires that such financial assistance shall not be
 25 24 distributed to owners or investors of the company to which the
 25 25 business development services are being provided and shall not
 25 26 be provided to other persons assisting with the provision of
 25 27 the services.
 25 28    Under current law, an entrepreneurial assistance provider is
 25 29 required to accept client referrals from the EDA as a condition
 25 30 of receiving a grant.  The division provides that the EDA may
 25 31 make client referrals to eligible providers.
 25 32    DIVISION IV ==== MISCELLANEOUS CHANGES.  Division IV makes
 25 33 several miscellaneous changes to other EDA programs.  The
 25 34 division amends the sales and use tax refund available under
 25 35 the workforce housing tax incentive program.  That refund
 26  1 is available for sales and use tax paid prior to project
 26  2 completion, which is currently defined to mean the first date
 26  3 upon which the average annualized production of finished
 26  4 product for the preceding 90=day period at the manufacturing
 26  5 facility operated by the eligible business is at least 50
 26  6 percent of the initial design capacity of the facility.  The
 26  7 division amends the definition of "project completion" to mean
 26  8 the date on which the EDA notifies the department of revenue
 26  9 that all applicable requirements of a workforce housing tax
 26 10 incentive program agreement are satisfied.  This provision
 26 11 takes effect upon enactment and applies retroactively to July
 26 12 1, 2014, for all workforce housing tax incentive agreements
 26 13 entered into on or after that date.
 26 14    The division allows the EDA to extend the project
 26 15 completion date for a project awarded tax incentives under the
 26 16 redevelopment tax credit program and the housing enterprise
 26 17 zone tax incentives program if the property that is the subject
 26 18 of the project suffered a catastrophic fire during the 2014
 26 19 calendar year.
       LSB 1212HV (3) 86
       mm/sc
 21 17 15E.41.  The division excludes investments in community=based
 21 18 seed capital funds from qualifying for the tax credit and
 21 19 makes several conforming amendments to remove references to
 21 20 community=based seed capital funds from the Code.
 21 21    The division modifies the amount and dollar limitation of
 21 22 the tax credit for a taxpayer.  The tax credit is increased
 21 23 from 20 percent to 25 percent of a taxpayer's equity investment
 21 24 in a qualifying business.  Under current law, a taxpayer cannot
 21 25 claim more than $50,000 of tax credit per investment in a
 21 26 qualifying business, and for each tax year a taxpayer and the
 21 27 taxpayer's affiliates cannot claim tax credits for more than
 21 28 five investments in five different qualifying businesses.  The
 21 29 division amends this dollar limitation to prohibit a natural
 21 30 person and the person's spouse, child, or sibling from claiming
 21 31 a combined amount of more than $100,000 in tax credits per tax
 21 32 year.
 21 33    The division also provides that no more than $500,000 in tax
 21 34 credits may be issued per tax year for equity investments in
 21 35 any one qualifying business.
 22  1 The division modifies the procedures for claiming the tax
 22  2 credit.  Under current law, the tax credit is not refundable
 22  3 but available for carryforward for up to five tax years.  The
 22  4 division makes the tax credit refundable for an investment
 22  5 made by a natural person, and for any other person reduces the
 22  6 carryforward period to three years.
 22  7    The division strikes a provision permitting the EDA
 22  8 to cooperate with small business development centers to
 22  9 disseminate information regarding the credits and to develop
 22 10 standard application forms, and requiring the EDA to distribute
 22 11 copies of the application forms to all community=based seed
 22 12 capital funds and potential individual investors.
 22 13    The division modifies the eligibility requirements for
 22 14 qualifying businesses.  The division strikes the requirement
 22 15 that a business have an owner that meets at least one of
 22 16 four qualifications relating to business education or
 22 17 business experience.  The division requires that a business
 22 18 be participating in an entrepreneurial assistance program,
 22 19 as defined in the division, but allows the EDA to waive this
 22 20 requirement if the business establishes that its owners,
 22 21 directors, officers, and employees have an appropriate level
 22 22 of experience such that an entrepreneurial assistance program
 22 23 would not materially change the prospects of the business.
 22 24 The EDA is allowed to consult with outside service providers
 22 25 in considering such a waiver.  The division increases from $5
 22 26 million to $10 million the maximum amount of net worth that
 22 27 a business may have to be considered a qualifying business.
 22 28 The division increases from $250,000 to $500,000 the amount of
 22 29 financing that a business must have in order to be considered a
 22 30 qualifying business, removes "near equity" from the types of
 22 31 financing that will be considered in that calculation, requires
 22 32 that the financing be secured at the time of application for
 22 33 the tax credits, and requires that the business have at least
 22 34 two investors at the time of application for the tax credits.
 22 35 These modified eligibility requirements apply to businesses
 23  1 that submit an application to the EDA to be registered as a
 23  2 qualifying business on or after the effective date of this
 23  3 division of the bill, and businesses that submitted such an
 23  4 application to the EDA before the effective date of this
 23  5 division of the bill shall be governed by current law.
 23  6    The division provides for the confidentiality of certain
 23  7 information with regard to the tax credit.  The identity of
 23  8 a qualifying business, the identity of an investor and the
 23  9 qualifying business in which the investor made an equity
 23 10 investment, and the total number and amount of tax credits
 23 11 issued shall be considered public information under Code
 23 12 chapter 22 (examination of public records), but any other
 23 13 information or record in the possession of the EDA with respect
 23 14 to the program shall be presumed by the EDA to be a trade secret
 23 15 protected under Code chapter 550 or common law and shall be
 23 16 kept confidential by the EDA unless otherwise ordered by a
 23 17 court.
 23 18    The division takes effect upon enactment and applies to
 23 19 equity investments in a qualifying business made on or after
 23 20 that date.  Equity investments in a qualifying business or
 23 21 community=based seed capital fund made prior to the effective
 23 22 date of the division shall be governed by current law.
 23 23    DIVISION III ==== ENTREPRENEUR INVESTMENT AWARDS PROGRAM.
 23 24  Division III amends the entrepreneur investment awards program
 23 25 administered by the EDA.  The division strikes provisions that
 23 26 prohibited the EDA from making awards under the program since
 23 27 July 1, 2014, and that required the EDA by December 31, 2014,
 23 28 to conduct a comprehensive review of the program and submit
 23 29 a report with specified information to the governor and the
 23 30 general assembly.
 23 31    The division modifies the purpose of the program to be
 23 32 to provide financial assistance to eligible entrepreneurial
 23 33 assistance providers (provider) that provide technical and
 23 34 financial assistance to entrepreneurs and start=up companies
 23 35 seeking to create, locate, or expand a business in Iowa.
 24  1 "Financial assistance" is defined in the division.
 24  2    The division changes the requirements for receiving an
 24  3 award.  To be eligible to receive an award under current
 24  4 law, an entrepreneurial assistance program must have been
 24  5 an Iowa=based business, expended at least $500,000 during
 24  6 the previous fiscal year to provide technical and financial
 24  7 assistance services that meet the broad=based needs of
 24  8 entrepreneurs seeking to create, locate, or expand a business
 24  9 in Iowa that intends to derive more than 10 percent of its
 24 10 gross sales from markets outside Iowa; and must have engaged
 24 11 and communicated with certain other programs, funding sources,
 24 12 and entities for its entrepreneur clients.  The division
 24 13 amends the eligibility for receiving financial assistance to
 24 14 require that a provider have its principal place of operations
 24 15 in Iowa and that the provider offer a comprehensive set of
 24 16 business development services to emerging and early=stage
 24 17 innovation companies to assist in the creation, location,
 24 18 growth, and long=term success of the company in Iowa.
 24 19 "Business development services" is defined in the division.
 24 20 Business development services may be performed at the physical
 24 21 location of the provider or the company and may be provided in
 24 22 consideration of equity participation in the company, a fee for
 24 23 services, or a membership agreement with the company.
 24 24    Under current law, the EDA board could approve, deny, or
 24 25 defer each application for a grant, and was required to award
 24 26 grants on a first=come, first=served basis.  The division
 24 27 specifies that the EDA board has the discretion to approve,
 24 28 deny, or defer each application for financial assistance and
 24 29 that the amount of financial assistance awarded to a provider
 24 30 is within the discretion of the EDA.  The division requires
 24 31 the EDA to award financial assistance on a competitive basis
 24 32 and allows the EDA to develop scoring criteria and establish
 24 33 minimum requirements for the receipt of a financial assistance
 24 34 award.
 24 35    In addition to the four factors relating to the provider's
 25  1 professional staff that the EDA may consider under current
 25  2 law in deciding whether to award financial assistance, the
 25  3 division provides that the EDA may also consider the service
 25  4 model and likelihood of success of the provider, the provider's
 25  5 similarity to other successful providers in the country, and
 25  6 the provider's financial need.
 25  7    The division modifies the maximum award amount for a
 25  8 recipient.  Under current law, a grant to an entrepreneur
 25  9 assistance program cannot exceed the lesser of 25 percent of
 25 10 the funds expended by the program during the previous fiscal
 25 11 year, 100 percent of the funds raised from certain persons
 25 12 by the program during the previous fiscal year, or $200,000.
 25 13 The division provides that the amount of financial assistance
 25 14 awarded to any one provider shall not exceed $200,000.
 25 15    The division modifies the permitted use of funds received
 25 16 under the program.  Under current law, grants are only
 25 17 permitted to be used for the purpose of operating costs
 25 18 incurred by the program.  The division specifies that financial
 25 19 assistance awarded to a provider shall only be used for
 25 20 the purpose of operating costs incurred by the provider in
 25 21 the provision of business development services to emerging
 25 22 and early=stage innovation companies in Iowa.  The division
 25 23 further requires that such financial assistance shall not be
 25 24 distributed to owners or investors of the company to which the
 25 25 business development services are being provided and shall not
 25 26 be provided to other persons assisting with the provision of
 25 27 the services.
 25 28    Under current law, an entrepreneurial assistance provider is
 25 29 required to accept client referrals from the EDA as a condition
 25 30 of receiving a grant.  The division provides that the EDA may
 25 31 make client referrals to eligible providers.
 25 32    DIVISION IV ==== MISCELLANEOUS CHANGES.  Division IV makes
 25 33 several miscellaneous changes to other EDA programs.  The
 25 34 division amends the sales and use tax refund available under
 25 35 the workforce housing tax incentive program.  That refund
 26  1 is available for sales and use tax paid prior to project
 26  2 completion, which is currently defined to mean the first date
 26  3 upon which the average annualized production of finished
 26  4 product for the preceding 90=day period at the manufacturing
 26  5 facility operated by the eligible business is at least 50
 26  6 percent of the initial design capacity of the facility.  The
 26  7 division amends the definition of "project completion" to mean
 26  8 the date on which the EDA notifies the department of revenue
 26  9 that all applicable requirements of a workforce housing tax
 26 10 incentive program agreement are satisfied.  This provision
 26 11 takes effect upon enactment and applies retroactively to July
 26 12 1, 2014, for all workforce housing tax incentive agreements
 26 13 entered into on or after that date.
 26 14    The division allows the EDA to extend the project
 26 15 completion date for a project awarded tax incentives under the
 26 16 redevelopment tax credit program and the housing enterprise
 26 17 zone tax incentives program if the property that is the subject
 26 18 of the project suffered a catastrophic fire during the 2014
 26 19 calendar year.

 21 18 seed capital funds from qualifying for the tax credit and
 21 19 makes several conforming amendments to remove references to
 21 20 community=based seed capital funds from the Code.
 21 21    The division modifies the amount and dollar limitation of
 21 22 the tax credit for a taxpayer.  The tax credit is increased
 21 23 from 20 percent to 25 percent of a taxpayer's equity investment
 21 24 in a qualifying business.  Under current law, a taxpayer cannot
 21 25 claim more than $50,000 of tax credit per investment in a
 21 26 qualifying business, and for each tax year a taxpayer and the
 21 27 taxpayer's affiliates cannot claim tax credits for more than
 21 28 five investments in five different qualifying businesses.  The
 21 29 division amends this dollar limitation to prohibit a natural
 21 30 person and the person's spouse, child, or sibling from claiming
 21 31 a combined amount of more than $100,000 in tax credits per tax
 21 32 year.
 21 33    The division also provides that no more than $500,000 in tax
 21 34 credits may be issued per tax year for equity investments in
 21 35 any one qualifying business.
 22  1 The division modifies the procedures for claiming the tax
 22  2 credit.  Under current law, the tax credit is not refundable
 22  3 but available for carryforward for up to five tax years.  The
 22  4 division makes the tax credit refundable for an investment
 22  5 made by a natural person, and for any other person reduces the
 22  6 carryforward period to three years.
 22  7    The division strikes a provision permitting the EDA
 22  8 to cooperate with small business development centers to
 22  9 disseminate information regarding the credits and to develop
 22 10 standard application forms, and requiring the EDA to distribute
 22 11 copies of the application forms to all community=based seed
 22 12 capital funds and potential individual investors.
 22 13    The division modifies the eligibility requirements for
 22 14 qualifying businesses.  The division strikes the requirement
 22 15 that a business have an owner that meets at least one of
 22 16 four qualifications relating to business education or
 22 17 business experience.  The division requires that a business
 22 18 be participating in an entrepreneurial assistance program,
 22 19 as defined in the division, but allows the EDA to waive this
 22 20 requirement if the business establishes that its owners,
 22 21 directors, officers, and employees have an appropriate level
 22 22 of experience such that an entrepreneurial assistance program
 22 23 would not materially change the prospects of the business.
 22 24 The EDA is allowed to consult with outside service providers
 22 25 in considering such a waiver.  The division increases from $5
 22 26 million to $10 million the maximum amount of net worth that
 22 27 a business may have to be considered a qualifying business.
 22 28 The division increases from $250,000 to $500,000 the amount of
 22 29 financing that a business must have in order to be considered a
 22 30 qualifying business, removes "near equity" from the types of
 22 31 financing that will be considered in that calculation, requires
 22 32 that the financing be secured at the time of application for
 22 33 the tax credits, and requires that the business have at least
 22 34 two investors at the time of application for the tax credits.
 22 35 These modified eligibility requirements apply to businesses
 23  1 that submit an application to the EDA to be registered as a
 23  2 qualifying business on or after the effective date of this
 23  3 division of the bill, and businesses that submitted such an
 23  4 application to the EDA before the effective date of this
 23  5 division of the bill shall be governed by current law.
 23  6    The division provides for the confidentiality of certain
 23  7 information with regard to the tax credit.  The identity of
 23  8 a qualifying business, the identity of an investor and the
 23  9 qualifying business in which the investor made an equity
 23 10 investment, and the total number and amount of tax credits
 23 11 issued shall be considered public information under Code
 23 12 chapter 22 (examination of public records), but any other
 23 13 information or record in the possession of the EDA with respect
 23 14 to the program shall be presumed by the EDA to be a trade secret
 23 15 protected under Code chapter 550 or common law and shall be
 23 16 kept confidential by the EDA unless otherwise ordered by a
 23 17 court.
 23 18    The division takes effect upon enactment and applies to
 23 19 equity investments in a qualifying business made on or after
 23 20 that date.  Equity investments in a qualifying business or
 23 21 community=based seed capital fund made prior to the effective
 23 22 date of the division shall be governed by current law.
 23 23    DIVISION III ==== ENTREPRENEUR INVESTMENT AWARDS PROGRAM.
 23 24  Division III amends the entrepreneur investment awards program
 23 25 administered by the EDA.  The division strikes provisions that
 23 26 prohibited the EDA from making awards under the program since
 23 27 July 1, 2014, and that required the EDA by December 31, 2014,
 23 28 to conduct a comprehensive review of the program and submit
 23 29 a report with specified information to the governor and the
 23 30 general assembly.
 23 31    The division modifies the purpose of the program to be
 23 32 to provide financial assistance to eligible entrepreneurial
 23 33 assistance providers (provider) that provide technical and
 23 34 financial assistance to entrepreneurs and start=up companies
 23 35 seeking to create, locate, or expand a business in Iowa.
 24  1 "Financial assistance" is defined in the division.
 24  2    The division changes the requirements for receiving an
 24  3 award.  To be eligible to receive an award under current
 24  4 law, an entrepreneurial assistance program must have been
 24  5 an Iowa=based business, expended at least $500,000 during
 24  6 the previous fiscal year to provide technical and financial
 24  7 assistance services that meet the broad=based needs of
 24  8 entrepreneurs seeking to create, locate, or expand a business
 24  9 in Iowa that intends to derive more than 10 percent of its
 24 10 gross sales from markets outside Iowa; and must have engaged
 24 11 and communicated with certain other programs, funding sources,
 24 12 and entities for its entrepreneur clients.  The division
 24 13 amends the eligibility for receiving financial assistance to
 24 14 require that a provider have its principal place of operations
 24 15 in Iowa and that the provider offer a comprehensive set of
 24 16 business development services to emerging and early=stage
 24 17 innovation companies to assist in the creation, location,
 24 18 growth, and long=term success of the company in Iowa.
 24 19 "Business development services" is defined in the division.
 24 20 Business development services may be performed at the physical
 24 21 location of the provider or the company and may be provided in
 24 22 consideration of equity participation in the company, a fee for
 24 23 services, or a membership agreement with the company.
 24 24    Under current law, the EDA board could approve, deny, or
 24 25 defer each application for a grant, and was required to award
 24 26 grants on a first=come, first=served basis.  The division
 24 27 specifies that the EDA board has the discretion to approve,
 24 28 deny, or defer each application for financial assistance and
 24 29 that the amount of financial assistance awarded to a provider
 24 30 is within the discretion of the EDA.  The division requires
 24 31 the EDA to award financial assistance on a competitive basis
 24 32 and allows the EDA to develop scoring criteria and establish
 24 33 minimum requirements for the receipt of a financial assistance
 24 34 award.
 24 35    In addition to the four factors relating to the provider's
 25  1 professional staff that the EDA may consider under current
 25  2 law in deciding whether to award financial assistance, the
 25  3 division provides that the EDA may also consider the service
 25  4 model and likelihood of success of the provider, the provider's
 25  5 similarity to other successful providers in the country, and
 25  6 the provider's financial need.
 25  7    The division modifies the maximum award amount for a
 25  8 recipient.  Under current law, a grant to an entrepreneur
 25  9 assistance program cannot exceed the lesser of 25 percent of
 25 10 the funds expended by the program during the previous fiscal
 25 11 year, 100 percent of the funds raised from certain persons
 25 12 by the program during the previous fiscal year, or $200,000.
 25 13 The division provides that the amount of financial assistance
 25 14 awarded to any one provider shall not exceed $200,000.
 25 15    The division modifies the permitted use of funds received
 25 16 under the program.  Under current law, grants are only
 25 17 permitted to be used for the purpose of operating costs
 25 18 incurred by the program.  The division specifies that financial
 25 19 assistance awarded to a provider shall only be used for
 25 20 the purpose of operating costs incurred by the provider in
 25 21 the provision of business development services to emerging
 25 22 and early=stage innovation companies in Iowa.  The division
 25 23 further requires that such financial assistance shall not be
 25 24 distributed to owners or investors of the company to which the
 25 25 business development services are being provided and shall not
 25 26 be provided to other persons assisting with the provision of
 25 27 the services.
 25 28    Under current law, an entrepreneurial assistance provider is
 25 29 required to accept client referrals from the EDA as a condition
 25 30 of receiving a grant.  The division provides that the EDA may
 25 31 make client referrals to eligible providers.
 25 32    DIVISION IV ==== MISCELLANEOUS CHANGES.  Division IV makes
 25 33 several miscellaneous changes to other EDA programs.  The
 25 34 division amends the sales and use tax refund available under
 25 35 the workforce housing tax incentive program.  That refund
 26  1 is available for sales and use tax paid prior to project
 26  2 completion, which is currently defined to mean the first date
 26  3 upon which the average annualized production of finished
 26  4 product for the preceding 90=day period at the manufacturing
 26  5 facility operated by the eligible business is at least 50
 26  6 percent of the initial design capacity of the facility.  The
 26  7 division amends the definition of "project completion" to mean
 26  8 the date on which the EDA notifies the department of revenue
 26  9 that all applicable requirements of a workforce housing tax
 26 10 incentive program agreement are satisfied.  This provision
 26 11 takes effect upon enactment and applies retroactively to July
 26 12 1, 2014, for all workforce housing tax incentive agreements
 26 13 entered into on or after that date.
 26 14    The division allows the EDA to extend the project
 26 15 completion date for a project awarded tax incentives under the
 26 16 redevelopment tax credit program and the housing enterprise
 26 17 zone tax incentives program if the property that is the subject
 26 18 of the project suffered a catastrophic fire during the 2014
 26 19 calendar year.
       LSB 1212HV (3) 86
       mm/sc
 21 19 makes several conforming amendments to remove references to
 21 20 community=based seed capital funds from the Code.
 21 21    The division modifies the amount and dollar limitation of
 21 22 the tax credit for a taxpayer.  The tax credit is increased
 21 23 from 20 percent to 25 percent of a taxpayer's equity investment
 21 24 in a qualifying business.  Under current law, a taxpayer cannot
 21 25 claim more than $50,000 of tax credit per investment in a
 21 26 qualifying business, and for each tax year a taxpayer and the
 21 27 taxpayer's affiliates cannot claim tax credits for more than
 21 28 five investments in five different qualifying businesses.  The
 21 29 division amends this dollar limitation to prohibit a natural
 21 30 person and the person's spouse, child, or sibling from claiming
 21 31 a combined amount of more than $100,000 in tax credits per tax
 21 32 year.
 21 33    The division also provides that no more than $500,000 in tax
 21 34 credits may be issued per tax year for equity investments in
 21 35 any one qualifying business.
 22  1 The division modifies the procedures for claiming the tax
 22  2 credit.  Under current law, the tax credit is not refundable
 22  3 but available for carryforward for up to five tax years.  The
 22  4 division makes the tax credit refundable for an investment
 22  5 made by a natural person, and for any other person reduces the
 22  6 carryforward period to three years.
 22  7    The division strikes a provision permitting the EDA
 22  8 to cooperate with small business development centers to
 22  9 disseminate information regarding the credits and to develop
 22 10 standard application forms, and requiring the EDA to distribute
 22 11 copies of the application forms to all community=based seed
 22 12 capital funds and potential individual investors.
 22 13    The division modifies the eligibility requirements for
 22 14 qualifying businesses.  The division strikes the requirement
 22 15 that a business have an owner that meets at least one of
 22 16 four qualifications relating to business education or
 22 17 business experience.  The division requires that a business
 22 18 be participating in an entrepreneurial assistance program,
 22 19 as defined in the division, but allows the EDA to waive this
 22 20 requirement if the business establishes that its owners,
 22 21 directors, officers, and employees have an appropriate level
 22 22 of experience such that an entrepreneurial assistance program
 22 23 would not materially change the prospects of the business.
 22 24 The EDA is allowed to consult with outside service providers
 22 25 in considering such a waiver.  The division increases from $5
 22 26 million to $10 million the maximum amount of net worth that
 22 27 a business may have to be considered a qualifying business.
 22 28 The division increases from $250,000 to $500,000 the amount of
 22 29 financing that a business must have in order to be considered a
 22 30 qualifying business, removes "near equity" from the types of
 22 31 financing that will be considered in that calculation, requires
 22 32 that the financing be secured at the time of application for
 22 33 the tax credits, and requires that the business have at least
 22 34 two investors at the time of application for the tax credits.
 22 35 These modified eligibility requirements apply to businesses
 23  1 that submit an application to the EDA to be registered as a
 23  2 qualifying business on or after the effective date of this
 23  3 division of the bill, and businesses that submitted such an
 23  4 application to the EDA before the effective date of this
 23  5 division of the bill shall be governed by current law.
 23  6    The division provides for the confidentiality of certain
 23  7 information with regard to the tax credit.  The identity of
 23  8 a qualifying business, the identity of an investor and the
 23  9 qualifying business in which the investor made an equity
 23 10 investment, and the total number and amount of tax credits
 23 11 issued shall be considered public information under Code
 23 12 chapter 22 (examination of public records), but any other
 23 13 information or record in the possession of the EDA with respect
 23 14 to the program shall be presumed by the EDA to be a trade secret
 23 15 protected under Code chapter 550 or common law and shall be
 23 16 kept confidential by the EDA unless otherwise ordered by a
 23 17 court.
 23 18    The division takes effect upon enactment and applies to
 23 19 equity investments in a qualifying business made on or after
 23 20 that date.  Equity investments in a qualifying business or
 23 21 community=based seed capital fund made prior to the effective
 23 22 date of the division shall be governed by current law.
 23 23    DIVISION III ==== ENTREPRENEUR INVESTMENT AWARDS PROGRAM.
 23 24  Division III amends the entrepreneur investment awards program
 23 25 administered by the EDA.  The division strikes provisions that
 23 26 prohibited the EDA from making awards under the program since
 23 27 July 1, 2014, and that required the EDA by December 31, 2014,
 23 28 to conduct a comprehensive review of the program and submit
 23 29 a report with specified information to the governor and the
 23 30 general assembly.
 23 31    The division modifies the purpose of the program to be
 23 32 to provide financial assistance to eligible entrepreneurial
 23 33 assistance providers (provider) that provide technical and
 23 34 financial assistance to entrepreneurs and start=up companies
 23 35 seeking to create, locate, or expand a business in Iowa.
 24  1 "Financial assistance" is defined in the division.
 24  2    The division changes the requirements for receiving an
 24  3 award.  To be eligible to receive an award under current
 24  4 law, an entrepreneurial assistance program must have been
 24  5 an Iowa=based business, expended at least $500,000 during
 24  6 the previous fiscal year to provide technical and financial
 24  7 assistance services that meet the broad=based needs of
 24  8 entrepreneurs seeking to create, locate, or expand a business
 24  9 in Iowa that intends to derive more than 10 percent of its
 24 10 gross sales from markets outside Iowa; and must have engaged
 24 11 and communicated with certain other programs, funding sources,
 24 12 and entities for its entrepreneur clients.  The division
 24 13 amends the eligibility for receiving financial assistance to
 24 14 require that a provider have its principal place of operations
 24 15 in Iowa and that the provider offer a comprehensive set of
 24 16 business development services to emerging and early=stage
 24 17 innovation companies to assist in the creation, location,
 24 18 growth, and long=term success of the company in Iowa.
 24 19 "Business development services" is defined in the division.
 24 20 Business development services may be performed at the physical
 24 21 location of the provider or the company and may be provided in
 24 22 consideration of equity participation in the company, a fee for
 24 23 services, or a membership agreement with the company.
 24 24    Under current law, the EDA board could approve, deny, or
 24 25 defer each application for a grant, and was required to award
 24 26 grants on a first=come, first=served basis.  The division
 24 27 specifies that the EDA board has the discretion to approve,
 24 28 deny, or defer each application for financial assistance and
 24 29 that the amount of financial assistance awarded to a provider
 24 30 is within the discretion of the EDA.  The division requires
 24 31 the EDA to award financial assistance on a competitive basis
 24 32 and allows the EDA to develop scoring criteria and establish
 24 33 minimum requirements for the receipt of a financial assistance
 24 34 award.
 24 35    In addition to the four factors relating to the provider's
 25  1 professional staff that the EDA may consider under current
 25  2 law in deciding whether to award financial assistance, the
 25  3 division provides that the EDA may also consider the service
 25  4 model and likelihood of success of the provider, the provider's
 25  5 similarity to other successful providers in the country, and
 25  6 the provider's financial need.
 25  7    The division modifies the maximum award amount for a
 25  8 recipient.  Under current law, a grant to an entrepreneur
 25  9 assistance program cannot exceed the lesser of 25 percent of
 25 10 the funds expended by the program during the previous fiscal
 25 11 year, 100 percent of the funds raised from certain persons
 25 12 by the program during the previous fiscal year, or $200,000.
 25 13 The division provides that the amount of financial assistance
 25 14 awarded to any one provider shall not exceed $200,000.
 25 15    The division modifies the permitted use of funds received
 25 16 under the program.  Under current law, grants are only
 25 17 permitted to be used for the purpose of operating costs
 25 18 incurred by the program.  The division specifies that financial
 25 19 assistance awarded to a provider shall only be used for
 25 20 the purpose of operating costs incurred by the provider in
 25 21 the provision of business development services to emerging
 25 22 and early=stage innovation companies in Iowa.  The division
 25 23 further requires that such financial assistance shall not be
 25 24 distributed to owners or investors of the company to which the
 25 25 business development services are being provided and shall not
 25 26 be provided to other persons assisting with the provision of
 25 27 the services.
 25 28    Under current law, an entrepreneurial assistance provider is
 25 29 required to accept client referrals from the EDA as a condition
 25 30 of receiving a grant.  The division provides that the EDA may
 25 31 make client referrals to eligible providers.
 25 32    DIVISION IV ==== MISCELLANEOUS CHANGES.  Division IV makes
 25 33 several miscellaneous changes to other EDA programs.  The
 25 34 division amends the sales and use tax refund available under
 25 35 the workforce housing tax incentive program.  That refund
 26  1 is available for sales and use tax paid prior to project
 26  2 completion, which is currently defined to mean the first date
 26  3 upon which the average annualized production of finished
 26  4 product for the preceding 90=day period at the manufacturing
 26  5 facility operated by the eligible business is at least 50
 26  6 percent of the initial design capacity of the facility.  The
 26  7 division amends the definition of "project completion" to mean
 26  8 the date on which the EDA notifies the department of revenue
 26  9 that all applicable requirements of a workforce housing tax
 26 10 incentive program agreement are satisfied.  This provision
 26 11 takes effect upon enactment and applies retroactively to July
 26 12 1, 2014, for all workforce housing tax incentive agreements
 26 13 entered into on or after that date.
 26 14    The division allows the EDA to extend the project
 26 15 completion date for a project awarded tax incentives under the
 26 16 redevelopment tax credit program and the housing enterprise
 26 17 zone tax incentives program if the property that is the subject
 26 18 of the project suffered a catastrophic fire during the 2014
 26 19 calendar year.

       mm/sc
 21 20 community=based seed capital funds from the Code.
 21 21    The division modifies the amount and dollar limitation of
 21 22 the tax credit for a taxpayer.  The tax credit is increased
 21 23 from 20 percent to 25 percent of a taxpayer's equity investment
 21 24 in a qualifying business.  Under current law, a taxpayer cannot
 21 25 claim more than $50,000 of tax credit per investment in a
 21 26 qualifying business, and for each tax year a taxpayer and the
 21 27 taxpayer's affiliates cannot claim tax credits for more than
 21 28 five investments in five different qualifying businesses.  The
 21 29 division amends this dollar limitation to prohibit a natural
 21 30 person and the person's spouse, child, or sibling from claiming
 21 31 a combined amount of more than $100,000 in tax credits per tax
 21 32 year.
 21 33    The division also provides that no more than $500,000 in tax
 21 34 credits may be issued per tax year for equity investments in
 21 35 any one qualifying business.
 22  1 The division modifies the procedures for claiming the tax
 22  2 credit.  Under current law, the tax credit is not refundable
 22  3 but available for carryforward for up to five tax years.  The
 22  4 division makes the tax credit refundable for an investment
 22  5 made by a natural person, and for any other person reduces the
 22  6 carryforward period to three years.
 22  7    The division strikes a provision permitting the EDA
 22  8 to cooperate with small business development centers to
 22  9 disseminate information regarding the credits and to develop
 22 10 standard application forms, and requiring the EDA to distribute
 22 11 copies of the application forms to all community=based seed
 22 12 capital funds and potential individual investors.
 22 13    The division modifies the eligibility requirements for
 22 14 qualifying businesses.  The division strikes the requirement
 22 15 that a business have an owner that meets at least one of
 22 16 four qualifications relating to business education or
 22 17 business experience.  The division requires that a business
 22 18 be participating in an entrepreneurial assistance program,
 22 19 as defined in the division, but allows the EDA to waive this
 22 20 requirement if the business establishes that its owners,
 22 21 directors, officers, and employees have an appropriate level
 22 22 of experience such that an entrepreneurial assistance program
 22 23 would not materially change the prospects of the business.
 22 24 The EDA is allowed to consult with outside service providers
 22 25 in considering such a waiver.  The division increases from $5
 22 26 million to $10 million the maximum amount of net worth that
 22 27 a business may have to be considered a qualifying business.
 22 28 The division increases from $250,000 to $500,000 the amount of
 22 29 financing that a business must have in order to be considered a
 22 30 qualifying business, removes "near equity" from the types of
 22 31 financing that will be considered in that calculation, requires
 22 32 that the financing be secured at the time of application for
 22 33 the tax credits, and requires that the business have at least
 22 34 two investors at the time of application for the tax credits.
 22 35 These modified eligibility requirements apply to businesses
 23  1 that submit an application to the EDA to be registered as a
 23  2 qualifying business on or after the effective date of this
 23  3 division of the bill, and businesses that submitted such an
 23  4 application to the EDA before the effective date of this
 23  5 division of the bill shall be governed by current law.
 23  6    The division provides for the confidentiality of certain
 23  7 information with regard to the tax credit.  The identity of
 23  8 a qualifying business, the identity of an investor and the
 23  9 qualifying business in which the investor made an equity
 23 10 investment, and the total number and amount of tax credits
 23 11 issued shall be considered public information under Code
 23 12 chapter 22 (examination of public records), but any other
 23 13 information or record in the possession of the EDA with respect
 23 14 to the program shall be presumed by the EDA to be a trade secret
 23 15 protected under Code chapter 550 or common law and shall be
 23 16 kept confidential by the EDA unless otherwise ordered by a
 23 17 court.
 23 18    The division takes effect upon enactment and applies to
 23 19 equity investments in a qualifying business made on or after
 23 20 that date.  Equity investments in a qualifying business or
 23 21 community=based seed capital fund made prior to the effective
 23 22 date of the division shall be governed by current law.
 23 23    DIVISION III ==== ENTREPRENEUR INVESTMENT AWARDS PROGRAM.
 23 24  Division III amends the entrepreneur investment awards program
 23 25 administered by the EDA.  The division strikes provisions that
 23 26 prohibited the EDA from making awards under the program since
 23 27 July 1, 2014, and that required the EDA by December 31, 2014,
 23 28 to conduct a comprehensive review of the program and submit
 23 29 a report with specified information to the governor and the
 23 30 general assembly.
 23 31    The division modifies the purpose of the program to be
 23 32 to provide financial assistance to eligible entrepreneurial
 23 33 assistance providers (provider) that provide technical and
 23 34 financial assistance to entrepreneurs and start=up companies
 23 35 seeking to create, locate, or expand a business in Iowa.
 24  1 "Financial assistance" is defined in the division.
 24  2    The division changes the requirements for receiving an
 24  3 award.  To be eligible to receive an award under current
 24  4 law, an entrepreneurial assistance program must have been
 24  5 an Iowa=based business, expended at least $500,000 during
 24  6 the previous fiscal year to provide technical and financial
 24  7 assistance services that meet the broad=based needs of
 24  8 entrepreneurs seeking to create, locate, or expand a business
 24  9 in Iowa that intends to derive more than 10 percent of its
 24 10 gross sales from markets outside Iowa; and must have engaged
 24 11 and communicated with certain other programs, funding sources,
 24 12 and entities for its entrepreneur clients.  The division
 24 13 amends the eligibility for receiving financial assistance to
 24 14 require that a provider have its principal place of operations
 24 15 in Iowa and that the provider offer a comprehensive set of
 24 16 business development services to emerging and early=stage
 24 17 innovation companies to assist in the creation, location,
 24 18 growth, and long=term success of the company in Iowa.
 24 19 "Business development services" is defined in the division.
 24 20 Business development services may be performed at the physical
 24 21 location of the provider or the company and may be provided in
 24 22 consideration of equity participation in the company, a fee for
 24 23 services, or a membership agreement with the company.
 24 24    Under current law, the EDA board could approve, deny, or
 24 25 defer each application for a grant, and was required to award
 24 26 grants on a first=come, first=served basis.  The division
 24 27 specifies that the EDA board has the discretion to approve,
 24 28 deny, or defer each application for financial assistance and
 24 29 that the amount of financial assistance awarded to a provider
 24 30 is within the discretion of the EDA.  The division requires
 24 31 the EDA to award financial assistance on a competitive basis
 24 32 and allows the EDA to develop scoring criteria and establish
 24 33 minimum requirements for the receipt of a financial assistance
 24 34 award.
 24 35    In addition to the four factors relating to the provider's
 25  1 professional staff that the EDA may consider under current
 25  2 law in deciding whether to award financial assistance, the
 25  3 division provides that the EDA may also consider the service
 25  4 model and likelihood of success of the provider, the provider's
 25  5 similarity to other successful providers in the country, and
 25  6 the provider's financial need.
 25  7    The division modifies the maximum award amount for a
 25  8 recipient.  Under current law, a grant to an entrepreneur
 25  9 assistance program cannot exceed the lesser of 25 percent of
 25 10 the funds expended by the program during the previous fiscal
 25 11 year, 100 percent of the funds raised from certain persons
 25 12 by the program during the previous fiscal year, or $200,000.
 25 13 The division provides that the amount of financial assistance
 25 14 awarded to any one provider shall not exceed $200,000.
 25 15    The division modifies the permitted use of funds received
 25 16 under the program.  Under current law, grants are only
 25 17 permitted to be used for the purpose of operating costs
 25 18 incurred by the program.  The division specifies that financial
 25 19 assistance awarded to a provider shall only be used for
 25 20 the purpose of operating costs incurred by the provider in
 25 21 the provision of business development services to emerging
 25 22 and early=stage innovation companies in Iowa.  The division
 25 23 further requires that such financial assistance shall not be
 25 24 distributed to owners or investors of the company to which the
 25 25 business development services are being provided and shall not
 25 26 be provided to other persons assisting with the provision of
 25 27 the services.
 25 28    Under current law, an entrepreneurial assistance provider is
 25 29 required to accept client referrals from the EDA as a condition
 25 30 of receiving a grant.  The division provides that the EDA may
 25 31 make client referrals to eligible providers.
 25 32    DIVISION IV ==== MISCELLANEOUS CHANGES.  Division IV makes
 25 33 several miscellaneous changes to other EDA programs.  The
 25 34 division amends the sales and use tax refund available under
 25 35 the workforce housing tax incentive program.  That refund
 26  1 is available for sales and use tax paid prior to project
 26  2 completion, which is currently defined to mean the first date
 26  3 upon which the average annualized production of finished
 26  4 product for the preceding 90=day period at the manufacturing
 26  5 facility operated by the eligible business is at least 50
 26  6 percent of the initial design capacity of the facility.  The
 26  7 division amends the definition of "project completion" to mean
 26  8 the date on which the EDA notifies the department of revenue
 26  9 that all applicable requirements of a workforce housing tax
 26 10 incentive program agreement are satisfied.  This provision
 26 11 takes effect upon enactment and applies retroactively to July
 26 12 1, 2014, for all workforce housing tax incentive agreements
 26 13 entered into on or after that date.
 26 14    The division allows the EDA to extend the project
 26 15 completion date for a project awarded tax incentives under the
 26 16 redevelopment tax credit program and the housing enterprise
 26 17 zone tax incentives program if the property that is the subject
 26 18 of the project suffered a catastrophic fire during the 2014
 26 19 calendar year.
       LSB 1212HV (3) 86
       mm/sc
 21 21    The division modifies the amount and dollar limitation of
 21 22 the tax credit for a taxpayer.  The tax credit is increased
 21 23 from 20 percent to 25 percent of a taxpayer's equity investment
 21 24 in a qualifying business.  Under current law, a taxpayer cannot
 21 25 claim more than $50,000 of tax credit per investment in a
 21 26 qualifying business, and for each tax year a taxpayer and the
 21 27 taxpayer's affiliates cannot claim tax credits for more than
 21 28 five investments in five different qualifying businesses.  The
 21 29 division amends this dollar limitation to prohibit a natural
 21 30 person and the person's spouse, child, or sibling from claiming
 21 31 a combined amount of more than $100,000 in tax credits per tax
 21 32 year.
 21 33    The division also provides that no more than $500,000 in tax
 21 34 credits may be issued per tax year for equity investments in
 21 35 any one qualifying business.
 22  1 The division modifies the procedures for claiming the tax
 22  2 credit.  Under current law, the tax credit is not refundable
 22  3 but available for carryforward for up to five tax years.  The
 22  4 division makes the tax credit refundable for an investment
 22  5 made by a natural person, and for any other person reduces the
 22  6 carryforward period to three years.
 22  7    The division strikes a provision permitting the EDA
 22  8 to cooperate with small business development centers to
 22  9 disseminate information regarding the credits and to develop
 22 10 standard application forms, and requiring the EDA to distribute
 22 11 copies of the application forms to all community=based seed
 22 12 capital funds and potential individual investors.
 22 13    The division modifies the eligibility requirements for
 22 14 qualifying businesses.  The division strikes the requirement
 22 15 that a business have an owner that meets at least one of
 22 16 four qualifications relating to business education or
 22 17 business experience.  The division requires that a business
 22 18 be participating in an entrepreneurial assistance program,
 22 19 as defined in the division, but allows the EDA to waive this
 22 20 requirement if the business establishes that its owners,
 22 21 directors, officers, and employees have an appropriate level
 22 22 of experience such that an entrepreneurial assistance program
 22 23 would not materially change the prospects of the business.
 22 24 The EDA is allowed to consult with outside service providers
 22 25 in considering such a waiver.  The division increases from $5
 22 26 million to $10 million the maximum amount of net worth that
 22 27 a business may have to be considered a qualifying business.
 22 28 The division increases from $250,000 to $500,000 the amount of
 22 29 financing that a business must have in order to be considered a
 22 30 qualifying business, removes "near equity" from the types of
 22 31 financing that will be considered in that calculation, requires
 22 32 that the financing be secured at the time of application for
 22 33 the tax credits, and requires that the business have at least
 22 34 two investors at the time of application for the tax credits.
 22 35 These modified eligibility requirements apply to businesses
 23  1 that submit an application to the EDA to be registered as a
 23  2 qualifying business on or after the effective date of this
 23  3 division of the bill, and businesses that submitted such an
 23  4 application to the EDA before the effective date of this
 23  5 division of the bill shall be governed by current law.
 23  6    The division provides for the confidentiality of certain
 23  7 information with regard to the tax credit.  The identity of
 23  8 a qualifying business, the identity of an investor and the
 23  9 qualifying business in which the investor made an equity
 23 10 investment, and the total number and amount of tax credits
 23 11 issued shall be considered public information under Code
 23 12 chapter 22 (examination of public records), but any other
 23 13 information or record in the possession of the EDA with respect
 23 14 to the program shall be presumed by the EDA to be a trade secret
 23 15 protected under Code chapter 550 or common law and shall be
 23 16 kept confidential by the EDA unless otherwise ordered by a
 23 17 court.
 23 18    The division takes effect upon enactment and applies to
 23 19 equity investments in a qualifying business made on or after
 23 20 that date.  Equity investments in a qualifying business or
 23 21 community=based seed capital fund made prior to the effective
 23 22 date of the division shall be governed by current law.
 23 23    DIVISION III ==== ENTREPRENEUR INVESTMENT AWARDS PROGRAM.
 23 24  Division III amends the entrepreneur investment awards program
 23 25 administered by the EDA.  The division strikes provisions that
 23 26 prohibited the EDA from making awards under the program since
 23 27 July 1, 2014, and that required the EDA by December 31, 2014,
 23 28 to conduct a comprehensive review of the program and submit
 23 29 a report with specified information to the governor and the
 23 30 general assembly.
 23 31    The division modifies the purpose of the program to be
 23 32 to provide financial assistance to eligible entrepreneurial
 23 33 assistance providers (provider) that provide technical and
 23 34 financial assistance to entrepreneurs and start=up companies
 23 35 seeking to create, locate, or expand a business in Iowa.
 24  1 "Financial assistance" is defined in the division.
 24  2    The division changes the requirements for receiving an
 24  3 award.  To be eligible to receive an award under current
 24  4 law, an entrepreneurial assistance program must have been
 24  5 an Iowa=based business, expended at least $500,000 during
 24  6 the previous fiscal year to provide technical and financial
 24  7 assistance services that meet the broad=based needs of
 24  8 entrepreneurs seeking to create, locate, or expand a business
 24  9 in Iowa that intends to derive more than 10 percent of its
 24 10 gross sales from markets outside Iowa; and must have engaged
 24 11 and communicated with certain other programs, funding sources,
 24 12 and entities for its entrepreneur clients.  The division
 24 13 amends the eligibility for receiving financial assistance to
 24 14 require that a provider have its principal place of operations
 24 15 in Iowa and that the provider offer a comprehensive set of
 24 16 business development services to emerging and early=stage
 24 17 innovation companies to assist in the creation, location,
 24 18 growth, and long=term success of the company in Iowa.
 24 19 "Business development services" is defined in the division.
 24 20 Business development services may be performed at the physical
 24 21 location of the provider or the company and may be provided in
 24 22 consideration of equity participation in the company, a fee for
 24 23 services, or a membership agreement with the company.
 24 24    Under current law, the EDA board could approve, deny, or
 24 25 defer each application for a grant, and was required to award
 24 26 grants on a first=come, first=served basis.  The division
 24 27 specifies that the EDA board has the discretion to approve,
 24 28 deny, or defer each application for financial assistance and
 24 29 that the amount of financial assistance awarded to a provider
 24 30 is within the discretion of the EDA.  The division requires
 24 31 the EDA to award financial assistance on a competitive basis
 24 32 and allows the EDA to develop scoring criteria and establish
 24 33 minimum requirements for the receipt of a financial assistance
 24 34 award.
 24 35    In addition to the four factors relating to the provider's
 25  1 professional staff that the EDA may consider under current
 25  2 law in deciding whether to award financial assistance, the
 25  3 division provides that the EDA may also consider the service
 25  4 model and likelihood of success of the provider, the provider's
 25  5 similarity to other successful providers in the country, and
 25  6 the provider's financial need.
 25  7    The division modifies the maximum award amount for a
 25  8 recipient.  Under current law, a grant to an entrepreneur
 25  9 assistance program cannot exceed the lesser of 25 percent of
 25 10 the funds expended by the program during the previous fiscal
 25 11 year, 100 percent of the funds raised from certain persons
 25 12 by the program during the previous fiscal year, or $200,000.
 25 13 The division provides that the amount of financial assistance
 25 14 awarded to any one provider shall not exceed $200,000.
 25 15    The division modifies the permitted use of funds received
 25 16 under the program.  Under current law, grants are only
 25 17 permitted to be used for the purpose of operating costs
 25 18 incurred by the program.  The division specifies that financial
 25 19 assistance awarded to a provider shall only be used for
 25 20 the purpose of operating costs incurred by the provider in
 25 21 the provision of business development services to emerging
 25 22 and early=stage innovation companies in Iowa.  The division
 25 23 further requires that such financial assistance shall not be
 25 24 distributed to owners or investors of the company to which the
 25 25 business development services are being provided and shall not
 25 26 be provided to other persons assisting with the provision of
 25 27 the services.
 25 28    Under current law, an entrepreneurial assistance provider is
 25 29 required to accept client referrals from the EDA as a condition
 25 30 of receiving a grant.  The division provides that the EDA may
 25 31 make client referrals to eligible providers.
 25 32    DIVISION IV ==== MISCELLANEOUS CHANGES.  Division IV makes
 25 33 several miscellaneous changes to other EDA programs.  The
 25 34 division amends the sales and use tax refund available under
 25 35 the workforce housing tax incentive program.  That refund
 26  1 is available for sales and use tax paid prior to project
 26  2 completion, which is currently defined to mean the first date
 26  3 upon which the average annualized production of finished
 26  4 product for the preceding 90=day period at the manufacturing
 26  5 facility operated by the eligible business is at least 50
 26  6 percent of the initial design capacity of the facility.  The
 26  7 division amends the definition of "project completion" to mean
 26  8 the date on which the EDA notifies the department of revenue
 26  9 that all applicable requirements of a workforce housing tax
 26 10 incentive program agreement are satisfied.  This provision
 26 11 takes effect upon enactment and applies retroactively to July
 26 12 1, 2014, for all workforce housing tax incentive agreements
 26 13 entered into on or after that date.
 26 14    The division allows the EDA to extend the project
 26 15 completion date for a project awarded tax incentives under the
 26 16 redevelopment tax credit program and the housing enterprise
 26 17 zone tax incentives program if the property that is the subject
 26 18 of the project suffered a catastrophic fire during the 2014
 26 19 calendar year.

 21 22 the tax credit for a taxpayer.  The tax credit is increased
 21 23 from 20 percent to 25 percent of a taxpayer's equity investment
 21 24 in a qualifying business.  Under current law, a taxpayer cannot
 21 25 claim more than $50,000 of tax credit per investment in a
 21 26 qualifying business, and for each tax year a taxpayer and the
 21 27 taxpayer's affiliates cannot claim tax credits for more than
 21 28 five investments in five different qualifying businesses.  The
 21 29 division amends this dollar limitation to prohibit a natural
 21 30 person and the person's spouse, child, or sibling from claiming
 21 31 a combined amount of more than $100,000 in tax credits per tax
 21 32 year.
 21 33    The division also provides that no more than $500,000 in tax
 21 34 credits may be issued per tax year for equity investments in
 21 35 any one qualifying business.
 22  1 The division modifies the procedures for claiming the tax
 22  2 credit.  Under current law, the tax credit is not refundable
 22  3 but available for carryforward for up to five tax years.  The
 22  4 division makes the tax credit refundable for an investment
 22  5 made by a natural person, and for any other person reduces the
 22  6 carryforward period to three years.
 22  7    The division strikes a provision permitting the EDA
 22  8 to cooperate with small business development centers to
 22  9 disseminate information regarding the credits and to develop
 22 10 standard application forms, and requiring the EDA to distribute
 22 11 copies of the application forms to all community=based seed
 22 12 capital funds and potential individual investors.
 22 13    The division modifies the eligibility requirements for
 22 14 qualifying businesses.  The division strikes the requirement
 22 15 that a business have an owner that meets at least one of
 22 16 four qualifications relating to business education or
 22 17 business experience.  The division requires that a business
 22 18 be participating in an entrepreneurial assistance program,
 22 19 as defined in the division, but allows the EDA to waive this
 22 20 requirement if the business establishes that its owners,
 22 21 directors, officers, and employees have an appropriate level
 22 22 of experience such that an entrepreneurial assistance program
 22 23 would not materially change the prospects of the business.
 22 24 The EDA is allowed to consult with outside service providers
 22 25 in considering such a waiver.  The division increases from $5
 22 26 million to $10 million the maximum amount of net worth that
 22 27 a business may have to be considered a qualifying business.
 22 28 The division increases from $250,000 to $500,000 the amount of
 22 29 financing that a business must have in order to be considered a
 22 30 qualifying business, removes "near equity" from the types of
 22 31 financing that will be considered in that calculation, requires
 22 32 that the financing be secured at the time of application for
 22 33 the tax credits, and requires that the business have at least
 22 34 two investors at the time of application for the tax credits.
 22 35 These modified eligibility requirements apply to businesses
 23  1 that submit an application to the EDA to be registered as a
 23  2 qualifying business on or after the effective date of this
 23  3 division of the bill, and businesses that submitted such an
 23  4 application to the EDA before the effective date of this
 23  5 division of the bill shall be governed by current law.
 23  6    The division provides for the confidentiality of certain
 23  7 information with regard to the tax credit.  The identity of
 23  8 a qualifying business, the identity of an investor and the
 23  9 qualifying business in which the investor made an equity
 23 10 investment, and the total number and amount of tax credits
 23 11 issued shall be considered public information under Code
 23 12 chapter 22 (examination of public records), but any other
 23 13 information or record in the possession of the EDA with respect
 23 14 to the program shall be presumed by the EDA to be a trade secret
 23 15 protected under Code chapter 550 or common law and shall be
 23 16 kept confidential by the EDA unless otherwise ordered by a
 23 17 court.
 23 18    The division takes effect upon enactment and applies to
 23 19 equity investments in a qualifying business made on or after
 23 20 that date.  Equity investments in a qualifying business or
 23 21 community=based seed capital fund made prior to the effective
 23 22 date of the division shall be governed by current law.
 23 23    DIVISION III ==== ENTREPRENEUR INVESTMENT AWARDS PROGRAM.
 23 24  Division III amends the entrepreneur investment awards program
 23 25 administered by the EDA.  The division strikes provisions that
 23 26 prohibited the EDA from making awards under the program since
 23 27 July 1, 2014, and that required the EDA by December 31, 2014,
 23 28 to conduct a comprehensive review of the program and submit

 23 33 assistance providers (provider) that provide technical and
 23 34 financial assistance to entrepreneurs and start=up companies
 23 35 seeking to create, locate, or expand a business in Iowa.
 24  1 "Financial assistance" is defined in the division.
 24  2    The division changes the requirements for receiving an
 24  3 award.  To be eligible to receive an award under current
 24  4 law, an entrepreneurial assistance program must have been
 24  5 an Iowa=based business, expended at least $500,000 during
 24  6 the previous fiscal year to provide technical and financial

 24 10 gross sales from markets outside Iowa; and must have engaged
 24 11 and communicated with certain other programs, funding sources,
 24 12 and entities for its entrepreneur clients.  The division
 24 13 amends the eligibility for receiving financial assistance to
 24 14 require that a provider have its principal place of operations
 24 15 in Iowa and that the provider offer a comprehensive set of
 24 16 business development services to emerging and early=stage
 24 17 innovation companies to assist in the creation, location,

 24 19 "Business development services" is defined in the division.
 24 20 Business development services may be performed at the physical
 24 21 location of the provider or the company and may be provided in
 24 22 consideration of equity participation in the company, a fee for
 24 23 services, or a membership agreement with the company.
 24 24    Under current law, the EDA board could approve, deny, or
 24 25 defer each application for a grant, and was required to award
 24 26 grants on a first=come, first=served basis.  The division
 24 27 specifies that the EDA board has the discretion to approve,
 24 28 deny, or defer each application for financial assistance and
 24 29 that the amount of financial assistance awarded to a provider
 24 30 is within the discretion of the EDA.  The division requires
 24 31 the EDA to award financial assistance on a competitive basis
 24 32 and allows the EDA to develop scoring criteria and establish
 24 33 minimum requirements for the receipt of a financial assistance
 24 34 award.
 24 35    In addition to the four factors relating to the provider's
 25  1 professional staff that the EDA may consider under current
 25  2 law in deciding whether to award financial assistance, the
 25  3 division provides that the EDA may also consider the service
 25  4 model and likelihood of success of the provider, the provider's
 25  5 similarity to other successful providers in the country, and
 25  6 the provider's financial need.
 25  7    The division modifies the maximum award amount for a
 25  8 recipient.  Under current law, a grant to an entrepreneur
 25  9 assistance program cannot exceed the lesser of 25 percent of
 25 10 the funds expended by the program during the previous fiscal
 25 11 year, 100 percent of the funds raised from certain persons
 25 12 by the program during the previous fiscal year, or $200,000.
 25 13 The division provides that the amount of financial assistance
 25 14 awarded to any one provider shall not exceed $200,000.
 25 15    The division modifies the permitted use of funds received
 25 16 under the program.  Under current law, grants are only
 25 17 permitted to be used for the purpose of operating costs
 25 18 incurred by the program.  The division specifies that financial
 25 19 assistance awarded to a provider shall only be used for
 25 20 the purpose of operating costs incurred by the provider in
 25 21 the provision of business development services to emerging
 25 22 and early=stage innovation companies in Iowa.  The division
 25 23 further requires that such financial assistance shall not be
 25 24 distributed to owners or investors of the company to which the
 25 25 business development services are being provided and shall not
 25 26 be provided to other persons assisting with the provision of
 25 27 the services.
 25 28    Under current law, an entrepreneurial assistance provider is
 25 29 required to accept client referrals from the EDA as a condition
 25 30 of receiving a grant.  The division provides that the EDA may
 25 31 make client referrals to eligible providers.
 25 32    DIVISION IV ==== MISCELLANEOUS CHANGES.  Division IV makes
 25 33 several miscellaneous changes to other EDA programs.  The
 25 34 division amends the sales and use tax refund available under
 25 35 the workforce housing tax incentive program.  That refund
 26  1 is available for sales and use tax paid prior to project
 26  2 completion, which is currently defined to mean the first date
 26  3 upon which the average annualized production of finished
 26  4 product for the preceding 90=day period at the manufacturing
 26  5 facility operated by the eligible business is at least 50
 26  6 percent of the initial design capacity of the facility.  The
 26  7 division amends the definition of "project completion" to mean
 26  8 the date on which the EDA notifies the department of revenue
 26  9 that all applicable requirements of a workforce housing tax
 26 10 incentive program agreement are satisfied.  This provision
 26 11 takes effect upon enactment and applies retroactively to July
 26 12 1, 2014, for all workforce housing tax incentive agreements
 26 13 entered into on or after that date.
 26 14    The division allows the EDA to extend the project
 26 15 completion date for a project awarded tax incentives under the
 26 16 redevelopment tax credit program and the housing enterprise
 26 17 zone tax incentives program if the property that is the subject
 26 18 of the project suffered a catastrophic fire during the 2014
 26 19 calendar year.
       LSB 1212HV (3) 86
       mm/sc
 21 23 from 20 percent to 25 percent of a taxpayer's equity investment
 21 24 in a qualifying business.  Under current law, a taxpayer cannot
 21 25 claim more than $50,000 of tax credit per investment in a
 21 26 qualifying business, and for each tax year a taxpayer and the
 21 27 taxpayer's affiliates cannot claim tax credits for more than
 21 28 five investments in five different qualifying businesses.  The
 21 29 division amends this dollar limitation to prohibit a natural
 21 30 person and the person's spouse, child, or sibling from claiming
 21 31 a combined amount of more than $100,000 in tax credits per tax
 21 32 year.
 21 33    The division also provides that no more than $500,000 in tax
 21 34 credits may be issued per tax year for equity investments in
 21 35 any one qualifying business.
 22  1 The division modifies the procedures for claiming the tax
 22  2 credit.  Under current law, the tax credit is not refundable
 22  3 but available for carryforward for up to five tax years.  The
 22  4 division makes the tax credit refundable for an investment
 22  5 made by a natural person, and for any other person reduces the
 22  6 carryforward period to three years.
 22  7    The division strikes a provision permitting the EDA
 22  8 to cooperate with small business development centers to
 22  9 disseminate information regarding the credits and to develop
 22 10 standard application forms, and requiring the EDA to distribute
 22 11 copies of the application forms to all community=based seed
 22 12 capital funds and potential individual investors.
 22 13    The division modifies the eligibility requirements for
 22 14 qualifying businesses.  The division strikes the requirement
 22 15 that a business have an owner that meets at least one of
 22 16 four qualifications relating to business education or
 22 17 business experience.  The division requires that a business
 22 18 be participating in an entrepreneurial assistance program,
 22 19 as defined in the division, but allows the EDA to waive this
 22 20 requirement if the business establishes that its owners,
 22 21 directors, officers, and employees have an appropriate level
 22 22 of experience such that an entrepreneurial assistance program
 22 23 would not materially change the prospects of the business.
 22 24 The EDA is allowed to consult with outside service providers
 22 25 in considering such a waiver.  The division increases from $5
 22 26 million to $10 million the maximum amount of net worth that
 22 27 a business may have to be considered a qualifying business.
 22 28 The division increases from $250,000 to $500,000 the amount of
 22 29 financing that a business must have in order to be considered a
 22 30 qualifying business, removes "near equity" from the types of
 22 31 financing that will be considered in that calculation, requires
 22 32 that the financing be secured at the time of application for
 22 33 the tax credits, and requires that the business have at least
 22 34 two investors at the time of application for the tax credits.
 22 35 These modified eligibility requirements apply to businesses
 23  1 that submit an application to the EDA to be registered as a
 23  2 qualifying business on or after the effective date of this
 23  3 division of the bill, and businesses that submitted such an
 23  4 application to the EDA before the effective date of this
 23  5 division of the bill shall be governed by current law.
 23  6    The division provides for the confidentiality of certain
 23  7 information with regard to the tax credit.  The identity of
 23  8 a qualifying business, the identity of an investor and the
 23  9 qualifying business in which the investor made an equity
 23 10 investment, and the total number and amount of tax credits
 23 11 issued shall be considered public information under Code
 23 12 chapter 22 (examination of public records), but any other
 23 13 information or record in the possession of the EDA with respect
 23 14 to the program shall be presumed by the EDA to be a trade secret
 23 15 protected under Code chapter 550 or common law and shall be
 23 16 kept confidential by the EDA unless otherwise ordered by a
 23 17 court.
 23 18    The division takes effect upon enactment and applies to
 23 19 equity investments in a qualifying business made on or after
 23 20 that date.  Equity investments in a qualifying business or
 23 21 community=based seed capital fund made prior to the effective
 23 22 date of the division shall be governed by current law.
 23 23    DIVISION III ==== ENTREPRENEUR INVESTMENT AWARDS PROGRAM.
 23 24  Division III amends the entrepreneur investment awards program
 23 25 administered by the EDA.  The division strikes provisions that
 23 26 prohibited the EDA from making awards under the program since
 23 27 July 1, 2014, and that required the EDA by December 31, 2014,
 23 28 to conduct a comprehensive review of the program and submit
 23 29 a report with specified information to the governor and the
 23 30 general assembly.
 23 31    The division modifies the purpose of the program to be
 23 32 to provide financial assistance to eligible entrepreneurial
 23 33 assistance providers (provider) that provide technical and
 23 34 financial assistance to entrepreneurs and start=up companies
 23 35 seeking to create, locate, or expand a business in Iowa.
 24  1 "Financial assistance" is defined in the division.
 24  2    The division changes the requirements for receiving an
 24  3 award.  To be eligible to receive an award under current
 24  4 law, an entrepreneurial assistance program must have been
 24  5 an Iowa=based business, expended at least $500,000 during
 24  6 the previous fiscal year to provide technical and financial
 24  7 assistance services that meet the broad=based needs of
 24  8 entrepreneurs seeking to create, locate, or expand a business
 24  9 in Iowa that intends to derive more than 10 percent of its
 24 10 gross sales from markets outside Iowa; and must have engaged
 24 11 and communicated with certain other programs, funding sources,
 24 12 and entities for its entrepreneur clients.  The division
 24 13 amends the eligibility for receiving financial assistance to
 24 14 require that a provider have its principal place of operations
 24 15 in Iowa and that the provider offer a comprehensive set of
 24 16 business development services to emerging and early=stage
 24 17 innovation companies to assist in the creation, location,
 24 18 growth, and long=term success of the company in Iowa.
 24 19 "Business development services" is defined in the division.
 24 20 Business development services may be performed at the physical
 24 21 location of the provider or the company and may be provided in
 24 22 consideration of equity participation in the company, a fee for
 24 23 services, or a membership agreement with the company.
 24 24    Under current law, the EDA board could approve, deny, or
 24 25 defer each application for a grant, and was required to award
 24 26 grants on a first=come, first=served basis.  The division
 24 27 specifies that the EDA board has the discretion to approve,
 24 28 deny, or defer each application for financial assistance and
 24 29 that the amount of financial assistance awarded to a provider
 24 30 is within the discretion of the EDA.  The division requires
 24 31 the EDA to award financial assistance on a competitive basis
 24 32 and allows the EDA to develop scoring criteria and establish
 24 33 minimum requirements for the receipt of a financial assistance
 24 34 award.
 24 35    In addition to the four factors relating to the provider's
 25  1 professional staff that the EDA may consider under current
 25  2 law in deciding whether to award financial assistance, the
 25  3 division provides that the EDA may also consider the service
 25  4 model and likelihood of success of the provider, the provider's
 25  5 similarity to other successful providers in the country, and
 25  6 the provider's financial need.
 25  7    The division modifies the maximum award amount for a
 25  8 recipient.  Under current law, a grant to an entrepreneur
 25  9 assistance program cannot exceed the lesser of 25 percent of
 25 10 the funds expended by the program during the previous fiscal
 25 11 year, 100 percent of the funds raised from certain persons
 25 12 by the program during the previous fiscal year, or $200,000.
 25 13 The division provides that the amount of financial assistance
 25 14 awarded to any one provider shall not exceed $200,000.
 25 15    The division modifies the permitted use of funds received
 25 16 under the program.  Under current law, grants are only
 25 17 permitted to be used for the purpose of operating costs
 25 18 incurred by the program.  The division specifies that financial
 25 19 assistance awarded to a provider shall only be used for
 25 20 the purpose of operating costs incurred by the provider in
 25 21 the provision of business development services to emerging
 25 22 and early=stage innovation companies in Iowa.  The division
 25 23 further requires that such financial assistance shall not be
 25 24 distributed to owners or investors of the company to which the
 25 25 business development services are being provided and shall not
 25 26 be provided to other persons assisting with the provision of
 25 27 the services.
 25 28    Under current law, an entrepreneurial assistance provider is
 25 29 required to accept client referrals from the EDA as a condition
 25 30 of receiving a grant.  The division provides that the EDA may
 25 31 make client referrals to eligible providers.
 25 32    DIVISION IV ==== MISCELLANEOUS CHANGES.  Division IV makes
 25 33 several miscellaneous changes to other EDA programs.  The
 25 34 division amends the sales and use tax refund available under
 25 35 the workforce housing tax incentive program.  That refund
 26  1 is available for sales and use tax paid prior to project
 26  2 completion, which is currently defined to mean the first date
 26  3 upon which the average annualized production of finished
 26  4 product for the preceding 90=day period at the manufacturing
 26  5 facility operated by the eligible business is at least 50
 26  6 percent of the initial design capacity of the facility.  The
 26  7 division amends the definition of "project completion" to mean
 26  8 the date on which the EDA notifies the department of revenue
 26  9 that all applicable requirements of a workforce housing tax
 26 10 incentive program agreement are satisfied.  This provision
 26 11 takes effect upon enactment and applies retroactively to July
 26 12 1, 2014, for all workforce housing tax incentive agreements
 26 13 entered into on or after that date.
 26 14    The division allows the EDA to extend the project
 26 15 completion date for a project awarded tax incentives under the
 26 16 redevelopment tax credit program and the housing enterprise
 26 17 zone tax incentives program if the property that is the subject
 26 18 of the project suffered a catastrophic fire during the 2014
 26 19 calendar year.

       mm/sc
 21 24 in a qualifying business.  Under current law, a taxpayer cannot
 21 25 claim more than $50,000 of tax credit per investment in a
 21 26 qualifying business, and for each tax year a taxpayer and the
 21 27 taxpayer's affiliates cannot claim tax credits for more than
 21 28 five investments in five different qualifying businesses.  The
 21 29 division amends this dollar limitation to prohibit a natural
 21 30 person and the person's spouse, child, or sibling from claiming
 21 31 a combined amount of more than $100,000 in tax credits per tax
 21 32 year.
 21 33    The division also provides that no more than $500,000 in tax
 21 34 credits may be issued per tax year for equity investments in
 21 35 any one qualifying business.
 22  1 The division modifies the procedures for claiming the tax
 22  2 credit.  Under current law, the tax credit is not refundable
 22  3 but available for carryforward for up to five tax years.  The
 22  4 division makes the tax credit refundable for an investment
 22  5 made by a natural person, and for any other person reduces the
 22  6 carryforward period to three years.
 22  7    The division strikes a provision permitting the EDA
 22  8 to cooperate with small business development centers to
 22  9 disseminate information regarding the credits and to develop
 22 10 standard application forms, and requiring the EDA to distribute
 22 11 copies of the application forms to all community=based seed
 22 12 capital funds and potential individual investors.
 22 13    The division modifies the eligibility requirements for
 22 14 qualifying businesses.  The division strikes the requirement
 22 15 that a business have an owner that meets at least one of
 22 16 four qualifications relating to business education or
 22 17 business experience.  The division requires that a business
 22 18 be participating in an entrepreneurial assistance program,
 22 19 as defined in the division, but allows the EDA to waive this
 22 20 requirement if the business establishes that its owners,
 22 21 directors, officers, and employees have an appropriate level
 22 22 of experience such that an entrepreneurial assistance program
 22 23 would not materially change the prospects of the business.
 22 24 The EDA is allowed to consult with outside service providers
 22 25 in considering such a waiver.  The division increases from $5
 22 26 million to $10 million the maximum amount of net worth that
 22 27 a business may have to be considered a qualifying business.
 22 28 The division increases from $250,000 to $500,000 the amount of
 22 29 financing that a business must have in order to be considered a
 22 30 qualifying business, removes "near equity" from the types of
 22 31 financing that will be considered in that calculation, requires
 22 32 that the financing be secured at the time of application for
 22 33 the tax credits, and requires that the business have at least
 22 34 two investors at the time of application for the tax credits.
 22 35 These modified eligibility requirements apply to businesses
 23  1 that submit an application to the EDA to be registered as a
 23  2 qualifying business on or after the effective date of this
 23  3 division of the bill, and businesses that submitted such an
 23  4 application to the EDA before the effective date of this
 23  5 division of the bill shall be governed by current law.
 23  6    The division provides for the confidentiality of certain
 23  7 information with regard to the tax credit.  The identity of
 23  8 a qualifying business, the identity of an investor and the
 23  9 qualifying business in which the investor made an equity
 23 10 investment, and the total number and amount of tax credits
 23 11 issued shall be considered public information under Code
 23 12 chapter 22 (examination of public records), but any other
 23 13 information or record in the possession of the EDA with respect
 23 14 to the program shall be presumed by the EDA to be a trade secret
 23 15 protected under Code chapter 550 or common law and shall be
 23 16 kept confidential by the EDA unless otherwise ordered by a
 23 17 court.
 23 18    The division takes effect upon enactment and applies to
 23 19 equity investments in a qualifying business made on or after
 23 20 that date.  Equity investments in a qualifying business or
 23 21 community=based seed capital fund made prior to the effective
 23 22 date of the division shall be governed by current law.
 23 23    DIVISION III ==== ENTREPRENEUR INVESTMENT AWARDS PROGRAM.
 23 24  Division III amends the entrepreneur investment awards program
 23 25 administered by the EDA.  The division strikes provisions that
 23 26 prohibited the EDA from making awards under the program since
 23 27 July 1, 2014, and that required the EDA by December 31, 2014,
 23 28 to conduct a comprehensive review of the program and submit
 23 29 a report with specified information to the governor and the
 23 30 general assembly.
 23 31    The division modifies the purpose of the program to be
 23 32 to provide financial assistance to eligible entrepreneurial
 23 33 assistance providers (provider) that provide technical and
 23 34 financial assistance to entrepreneurs and start=up companies
 23 35 seeking to create, locate, or expand a business in Iowa.
 24  1 "Financial assistance" is defined in the division.
 24  2    The division changes the requirements for receiving an
 24  3 award.  To be eligible to receive an award under current
 24  4 law, an entrepreneurial assistance program must have been
 24  5 an Iowa=based business, expended at least $500,000 during
 24  6 the previous fiscal year to provide technical and financial
 24  7 assistance services that meet the broad=based needs of
 24  8 entrepreneurs seeking to create, locate, or expand a business
 24  9 in Iowa that intends to derive more than 10 percent of its
 24 10 gross sales from markets outside Iowa; and must have engaged
 24 11 and communicated with certain other programs, funding sources,
 24 12 and entities for its entrepreneur clients.  The division
 24 13 amends the eligibility for receiving financial assistance to
 24 14 require that a provider have its principal place of operations
 24 15 in Iowa and that the provider offer a comprehensive set of
 24 16 business development services to emerging and early=stage
 24 17 innovation companies to assist in the creation, location,
 24 18 growth, and long=term success of the company in Iowa.
 24 19 "Business development services" is defined in the division.
 24 20 Business development services may be performed at the physical
 24 21 location of the provider or the company and may be provided in
 24 22 consideration of equity participation in the company, a fee for
 24 23 services, or a membership agreement with the company.
 24 24    Under current law, the EDA board could approve, deny, or
 24 25 defer each application for a grant, and was required to award
 24 26 grants on a first=come, first=served basis.  The division
 24 27 specifies that the EDA board has the discretion to approve,
 24 28 deny, or defer each application for financial assistance and
 24 29 that the amount of financial assistance awarded to a provider
 24 30 is within the discretion of the EDA.  The division requires
 24 31 the EDA to award financial assistance on a competitive basis
 24 32 and allows the EDA to develop scoring criteria and establish
 24 33 minimum requirements for the receipt of a financial assistance
 24 34 award.
 24 35    In addition to the four factors relating to the provider's
 25  1 professional staff that the EDA may consider under current
 25  2 law in deciding whether to award financial assistance, the
 25  3 division provides that the EDA may also consider the service
 25  4 model and likelihood of success of the provider, the provider's
 25  5 similarity to other successful providers in the country, and
 25  6 the provider's financial need.
 25  7    The division modifies the maximum award amount for a
 25  8 recipient.  Under current law, a grant to an entrepreneur
 25  9 assistance program cannot exceed the lesser of 25 percent of
 25 10 the funds expended by the program during the previous fiscal
 25 11 year, 100 percent of the funds raised from certain persons
 25 12 by the program during the previous fiscal year, or $200,000.
 25 13 The division provides that the amount of financial assistance
 25 14 awarded to any one provider shall not exceed $200,000.
 25 15    The division modifies the permitted use of funds received
 25 16 under the program.  Under current law, grants are only
 25 17 permitted to be used for the purpose of operating costs
 25 18 incurred by the program.  The division specifies that financial
 25 19 assistance awarded to a provider shall only be used for
 25 20 the purpose of operating costs incurred by the provider in
 25 21 the provision of business development services to emerging
 25 22 and early=stage innovation companies in Iowa.  The division
 25 23 further requires that such financial assistance shall not be
 25 24 distributed to owners or investors of the company to which the
 25 25 business development services are being provided and shall not
 25 26 be provided to other persons assisting with the provision of
 25 27 the services.
 25 28    Under current law, an entrepreneurial assistance provider is
 25 29 required to accept client referrals from the EDA as a condition
 25 30 of receiving a grant.  The division provides that the EDA may
 25 31 make client referrals to eligible providers.
 25 32    DIVISION IV ==== MISCELLANEOUS CHANGES.  Division IV makes
 25 33 several miscellaneous changes to other EDA programs.  The
 25 34 division amends the sales and use tax refund available under
 25 35 the workforce housing tax incentive program.  That refund
 26  1 is available for sales and use tax paid prior to project
 26  2 completion, which is currently defined to mean the first date

 26  4 product for the preceding 90=day period at the manufacturing
 26  5 facility operated by the eligible business is at least 50
 26  6 percent of the initial design capacity of the facility.  The
 26  7 division amends the definition of "project completion" to mean
 26  8 the date on which the EDA notifies the department of revenue
 26  9 that all applicable requirements of a workforce housing tax
 26 10 incentive program agreement are satisfied.  This provision
 26 11 takes effect upon enactment and applies retroactively to July
 26 12 1, 2014, for all workforce housing tax incentive agreements
 26 13 entered into on or after that date.
 26 14    The division allows the EDA to extend the project
 26 15 completion date for a project awarded tax incentives under the
 26 16 redevelopment tax credit program and the housing enterprise
 26 17 zone tax incentives program if the property that is the subject

 21 25 claim more than $50,000 of tax credit per investment in a

 21 27 taxpayer's affiliates cannot claim tax credits for more than
 21 28 five investments in five different qualifying businesses.  The
 21 29 division amends this dollar limitation to prohibit a natural
 21 30 person and the person's spouse, child, or sibling from claiming
 21 31 a combined amount of more than $100,000 in tax credits per tax
 21 32 year.
 21 33    The division also provides that no more than $500,000 in tax
 21 34 credits may be issued per tax year for equity investments in
 21 35 any one qualifying business.
 22  1 The division modifies the procedures for claiming the tax
 22  2 credit.  Under current law, the tax credit is not refundable
 22  3 but available for carryforward for up to five tax years.  The
 22  4 division makes the tax credit refundable for an investment
 22  5 made by a natural person, and for any other person reduces the
 22  6 carryforward period to three years.
 22  7    The division strikes a provision permitting the EDA
 22  8 to cooperate with small business development centers to
 22  9 disseminate information regarding the credits and to develop
 22 10 standard application forms, and requiring the EDA to distribute
 22 11 copies of the application forms to all community=based seed
 22 12 capital funds and potential individual investors.
 22 13    The division modifies the eligibility requirements for
 22 14 qualifying businesses.  The division strikes the requirement
 22 15 that a business have an owner that meets at least one of
 22 16 four qualifications relating to business education or
 22 17 business experience.  The division requires that a business
 22 18 be participating in an entrepreneurial assistance program,
 22 19 as defined in the division, but allows the EDA to waive this
 22 20 requirement if the business establishes that its owners,
 22 21 directors, officers, and employees have an appropriate level
 22 22 of experience such that an entrepreneurial assistance program
 22 23 would not materially change the prospects of the business.
 22 24 The EDA is allowed to consult with outside service providers
 22 25 in considering such a waiver.  The division increases from $5
 22 26 million to $10 million the maximum amount of net worth that
 22 27 a business may have to be considered a qualifying business.
 22 28 The division increases from $250,000 to $500,000 the amount of
 22 29 financing that a business must have in order to be considered a
 22 30 qualifying business, removes "near equity" from the types of
 22 31 financing that will be considered in that calculation, requires
 22 32 that the financing be secured at the time of application for
 22 33 the tax credits, and requires that the business have at least
 22 34 two investors at the time of application for the tax credits.
 22 35 These modified eligibility requirements apply to businesses
 23  1 that submit an application to the EDA to be registered as a
 23  2 qualifying business on or after the effective date of this
 23  3 division of the bill, and businesses that submitted such an
 23  4 application to the EDA before the effective date of this
 23  5 division of the bill shall be governed by current law.
 23  6    The division provides for the confidentiality of certain
 23  7 information with regard to the tax credit.  The identity of
 23  8 a qualifying business, the identity of an investor and the
 23  9 qualifying business in which the investor made an equity
 23 10 investment, and the total number and amount of tax credits
 23 11 issued shall be considered public information under Code
 23 12 chapter 22 (examination of public records), but any other
 23 13 information or record in the possession of the EDA with respect
 23 14 to the program shall be presumed by the EDA to be a trade secret
 23 15 protected under Code chapter 550 or common law and shall be
 23 16 kept confidential by the EDA unless otherwise ordered by a
 23 17 court.
 23 18    The division takes effect upon enactment and applies to
 23 19 equity investments in a qualifying business made on or after
 23 20 that date.  Equity investments in a qualifying business or
 23 21 community=based seed capital fund made prior to the effective
 23 22 date of the division shall be governed by current law.
 23 23    DIVISION III ==== ENTREPRENEUR INVESTMENT AWARDS PROGRAM.
 23 24  Division III amends the entrepreneur investment awards program
 23 25 administered by the EDA.  The division strikes provisions that
 23 26 prohibited the EDA from making awards under the program since
 23 27 July 1, 2014, and that required the EDA by December 31, 2014,
 23 28 to conduct a comprehensive review of the program and submit
 23 29 a report with specified information to the governor and the
 23 30 general assembly.
 23 31    The division modifies the purpose of the program to be
 23 32 to provide financial assistance to eligible entrepreneurial
 23 33 assistance providers (provider) that provide technical and
 23 34 financial assistance to entrepreneurs and start=up companies
 23 35 seeking to create, locate, or expand a business in Iowa.
 24  1 "Financial assistance" is defined in the division.
 24  2    The division changes the requirements for receiving an
 24  3 award.  To be eligible to receive an award under current
 24  4 law, an entrepreneurial assistance program must have been
 24  5 an Iowa=based business, expended at least $500,000 during
 24  6 the previous fiscal year to provide technical and financial
 24  7 assistance services that meet the broad=based needs of
 24  8 entrepreneurs seeking to create, locate, or expand a business
 24  9 in Iowa that intends to derive more than 10 percent of its
 24 10 gross sales from markets outside Iowa; and must have engaged
 24 11 and communicated with certain other programs, funding sources,
 24 12 and entities for its entrepreneur clients.  The division
 24 13 amends the eligibility for receiving financial assistance to
 24 14 require that a provider have its principal place of operations
 24 15 in Iowa and that the provider offer a comprehensive set of
 24 16 business development services to emerging and early=stage
 24 17 innovation companies to assist in the creation, location,
 24 18 growth, and long=term success of the company in Iowa.
 24 19 "Business development services" is defined in the division.
 24 20 Business development services may be performed at the physical
 24 21 location of the provider or the company and may be provided in
 24 22 consideration of equity participation in the company, a fee for
 24 23 services, or a membership agreement with the company.
 24 24    Under current law, the EDA board could approve, deny, or
 24 25 defer each application for a grant, and was required to award
 24 26 grants on a first=come, first=served basis.  The division
 24 27 specifies that the EDA board has the discretion to approve,
 24 28 deny, or defer each application for financial assistance and
 24 29 that the amount of financial assistance awarded to a provider
 24 30 is within the discretion of the EDA.  The division requires
 24 31 the EDA to award financial assistance on a competitive basis
 24 32 and allows the EDA to develop scoring criteria and establish
 24 33 minimum requirements for the receipt of a financial assistance
 24 34 award.
 24 35    In addition to the four factors relating to the provider's
 25  1 professional staff that the EDA may consider under current
 25  2 law in deciding whether to award financial assistance, the
 25  3 division provides that the EDA may also consider the service
 25  4 model and likelihood of success of the provider, the provider's
 25  5 similarity to other successful providers in the country, and
 25  6 the provider's financial need.
 25  7    The division modifies the maximum award amount for a
 25  8 recipient.  Under current law, a grant to an entrepreneur
 25  9 assistance program cannot exceed the lesser of 25 percent of
 25 10 the funds expended by the program during the previous fiscal
 25 11 year, 100 percent of the funds raised from certain persons
 25 12 by the program during the previous fiscal year, or $200,000.
 25 13 The division provides that the amount of financial assistance
 25 14 awarded to any one provider shall not exceed $200,000.
 25 15    The division modifies the permitted use of funds received
 25 16 under the program.  Under current law, grants are only
 25 17 permitted to be used for the purpose of operating costs
 25 18 incurred by the program.  The division specifies that financial
 25 19 assistance awarded to a provider shall only be used for
 25 20 the purpose of operating costs incurred by the provider in
 25 21 the provision of business development services to emerging
 25 22 and early=stage innovation companies in Iowa.  The division
 25 23 further requires that such financial assistance shall not be
 25 24 distributed to owners or investors of the company to which the
 25 25 business development services are being provided and shall not
 25 26 be provided to other persons assisting with the provision of
 25 27 the services.
 25 28    Under current law, an entrepreneurial assistance provider is
 25 29 required to accept client referrals from the EDA as a condition
 25 30 of receiving a grant.  The division provides that the EDA may
 25 31 make client referrals to eligible providers.
 25 32    DIVISION IV ==== MISCELLANEOUS CHANGES.  Division IV makes
 25 33 several miscellaneous changes to other EDA programs.  The
 25 34 division amends the sales and use tax refund available under
 25 35 the workforce housing tax incentive program.  That refund
 26  1 is available for sales and use tax paid prior to project
 26  2 completion, which is currently defined to mean the first date
 26  3 upon which the average annualized production of finished
 26  4 product for the preceding 90=day period at the manufacturing
 26  5 facility operated by the eligible business is at least 50
 26  6 percent of the initial design capacity of the facility.  The
 26  7 division amends the definition of "project completion" to mean
 26  8 the date on which the EDA notifies the department of revenue
 26  9 that all applicable requirements of a workforce housing tax
 26 10 incentive program agreement are satisfied.  This provision
 26 11 takes effect upon enactment and applies retroactively to July
 26 12 1, 2014, for all workforce housing tax incentive agreements
 26 13 entered into on or after that date.
 26 14    The division allows the EDA to extend the project
 26 15 completion date for a project awarded tax incentives under the
 26 16 redevelopment tax credit program and the housing enterprise
 26 17 zone tax incentives program if the property that is the subject
 26 18 of the project suffered a catastrophic fire during the 2014
 26 19 calendar year.

       mm/sc
 21 26 qualifying business, and for each tax year a taxpayer and the
 21 27 taxpayer's affiliates cannot claim tax credits for more than
 21 28 five investments in five different qualifying businesses.  The
 21 29 division amends this dollar limitation to prohibit a natural
 21 30 person and the person's spouse, child, or sibling from claiming
 21 31 a combined amount of more than $100,000 in tax credits per tax
 21 32 year.
 21 33    The division also provides that no more than $500,000 in tax
 21 34 credits may be issued per tax year for equity investments in
 21 35 any one qualifying business.
 22  1 The division modifies the procedures for claiming the tax
 22  2 credit.  Under current law, the tax credit is not refundable
 22  3 but available for carryforward for up to five tax years.  The
 22  4 division makes the tax credit refundable for an investment
 22  5 made by a natural person, and for any other person reduces the
 22  6 carryforward period to three years.
 22  7    The division strikes a provision permitting the EDA
 22  8 to cooperate with small business development centers to
 22  9 disseminate information regarding the credits and to develop
 22 10 standard application forms, and requiring the EDA to distribute
 22 11 copies of the application forms to all community=based seed
 22 12 capital funds and potential individual investors.
 22 13    The division modifies the eligibility requirements for
 22 14 qualifying businesses.  The division strikes the requirement
 22 15 that a business have an owner that meets at least one of
 22 16 four qualifications relating to business education or
 22 17 business experience.  The division requires that a business
 22 18 be participating in an entrepreneurial assistance program,
 22 19 as defined in the division, but allows the EDA to waive this
 22 20 requirement if the business establishes that its owners,
 22 21 directors, officers, and employees have an appropriate level
 22 22 of experience such that an entrepreneurial assistance program
 22 23 would not materially change the prospects of the business.
 22 24 The EDA is allowed to consult with outside service providers
 22 25 in considering such a waiver.  The division increases from $5
 22 26 million to $10 million the maximum amount of net worth that
 22 27 a business may have to be considered a qualifying business.
 22 28 The division increases from $250,000 to $500,000 the amount of
 22 29 financing that a business must have in order to be considered a
 22 30 qualifying business, removes "near equity" from the types of
 22 31 financing that will be considered in that calculation, requires
 22 32 that the financing be secured at the time of application for
 22 33 the tax credits, and requires that the business have at least
 22 34 two investors at the time of application for the tax credits.
 22 35 These modified eligibility requirements apply to businesses
 23  1 that submit an application to the EDA to be registered as a
 23  2 qualifying business on or after the effective date of this
 23  3 division of the bill, and businesses that submitted such an
 23  4 application to the EDA before the effective date of this
 23  5 division of the bill shall be governed by current law.
 23  6    The division provides for the confidentiality of certain
 23  7 information with regard to the tax credit.  The identity of
 23  8 a qualifying business, the identity of an investor and the
 23  9 qualifying business in which the investor made an equity
 23 10 investment, and the total number and amount of tax credits
 23 11 issued shall be considered public information under Code
 23 12 chapter 22 (examination of public records), but any other
 23 13 information or record in the possession of the EDA with respect
 23 14 to the program shall be presumed by the EDA to be a trade secret
 23 15 protected under Code chapter 550 or common law and shall be
 23 16 kept confidential by the EDA unless otherwise ordered by a
 23 17 court.
 23 18    The division takes effect upon enactment and applies to
 23 19 equity investments in a qualifying business made on or after
 23 20 that date.  Equity investments in a qualifying business or
 23 21 community=based seed capital fund made prior to the effective
 23 22 date of the division shall be governed by current law.
 23 23    DIVISION III ==== ENTREPRENEUR INVESTMENT AWARDS PROGRAM.
 23 24  Division III amends the entrepreneur investment awards program
 23 25 administered by the EDA.  The division strikes provisions that
 23 26 prohibited the EDA from making awards under the program since
 23 27 July 1, 2014, and that required the EDA by December 31, 2014,
 23 28 to conduct a comprehensive review of the program and submit
 23 29 a report with specified information to the governor and the
 23 30 general assembly.
 23 31    The division modifies the purpose of the program to be
 23 32 to provide financial assistance to eligible entrepreneurial
 23 33 assistance providers (provider) that provide technical and
 23 34 financial assistance to entrepreneurs and start=up companies
 23 35 seeking to create, locate, or expand a business in Iowa.
 24  1 "Financial assistance" is defined in the division.
 24  2    The division changes the requirements for receiving an
 24  3 award.  To be eligible to receive an award under current
 24  4 law, an entrepreneurial assistance program must have been
 24  5 an Iowa=based business, expended at least $500,000 during
 24  6 the previous fiscal year to provide technical and financial
 24  7 assistance services that meet the broad=based needs of

 24  9 in Iowa that intends to derive more than 10 percent of its
 24 10 gross sales from markets outside Iowa; and must have engaged
 24 11 and communicated with certain other programs, funding sources,
 24 12 and entities for its entrepreneur clients.  The division
 24 13 amends the eligibility for receiving financial assistance to
 24 14 require that a provider have its principal place of operations
 24 15 in Iowa and that the provider offer a comprehensive set of
 24 16 business development services to emerging and early=stage
 24 17 innovation companies to assist in the creation, location,
 24 18 growth, and long=term success of the company in Iowa.
 24 19 "Business development services" is defined in the division.
 24 20 Business development services may be performed at the physical
 24 21 location of the provider or the company and may be provided in
 24 22 consideration of equity participation in the company, a fee for
 24 23 services, or a membership agreement with the company.
 24 24    Under current law, the EDA board could approve, deny, or
 24 25 defer each application for a grant, and was required to award
 24 26 grants on a first=come, first=served basis.  The division
 24 27 specifies that the EDA board has the discretion to approve,
 24 28 deny, or defer each application for financial assistance and
 24 29 that the amount of financial assistance awarded to a provider
 24 30 is within the discretion of the EDA.  The division requires
 24 31 the EDA to award financial assistance on a competitive basis
 24 32 and allows the EDA to develop scoring criteria and establish
 24 33 minimum requirements for the receipt of a financial assistance
 24 34 award.
 24 35    In addition to the four factors relating to the provider's
 25  1 professional staff that the EDA may consider under current
 25  2 law in deciding whether to award financial assistance, the
 25  3 division provides that the EDA may also consider the service
 25  4 model and likelihood of success of the provider, the provider's
 25  5 similarity to other successful providers in the country, and
 25  6 the provider's financial need.
 25  7    The division modifies the maximum award amount for a
 25  8 recipient.  Under current law, a grant to an entrepreneur
 25  9 assistance program cannot exceed the lesser of 25 percent of
 25 10 the funds expended by the program during the previous fiscal
 25 11 year, 100 percent of the funds raised from certain persons
 25 12 by the program during the previous fiscal year, or $200,000.
 25 13 The division provides that the amount of financial assistance
 25 14 awarded to any one provider shall not exceed $200,000.
 25 15    The division modifies the permitted use of funds received
 25 16 under the program.  Under current law, grants are only
 25 17 permitted to be used for the purpose of operating costs
 25 18 incurred by the program.  The division specifies that financial
 25 19 assistance awarded to a provider shall only be used for
 25 20 the purpose of operating costs incurred by the provider in
 25 21 the provision of business development services to emerging
 25 22 and early=stage innovation companies in Iowa.  The division
 25 23 further requires that such financial assistance shall not be
 25 24 distributed to owners or investors of the company to which the
 25 25 business development services are being provided and shall not
 25 26 be provided to other persons assisting with the provision of
 25 27 the services.
 25 28    Under current law, an entrepreneurial assistance provider is
 25 29 required to accept client referrals from the EDA as a condition
 25 30 of receiving a grant.  The division provides that the EDA may
 25 31 make client referrals to eligible providers.
 25 32    DIVISION IV ==== MISCELLANEOUS CHANGES.  Division IV makes
 25 33 several miscellaneous changes to other EDA programs.  The
 25 34 division amends the sales and use tax refund available under

 26  9 that all applicable requirements of a workforce housing tax
 26 10 incentive program agreement are satisfied.  This provision
 26 11 takes effect upon enactment and applies retroactively to July

 21 27 taxpayer's affiliates cannot claim tax credits for more than

 21 29 division amends this dollar limitation to prohibit a natural
 21 30 person and the person's spouse, child, or sibling from claiming
 21 31 a combined amount of more than $100,000 in tax credits per tax
 21 32 year.
 21 33    The division also provides that no more than $500,000 in tax
 21 34 credits may be issued per tax year for equity investments in
 21 35 any one qualifying business.
 22  1 The division modifies the procedures for claiming the tax
 22  2 credit.  Under current law, the tax credit is not refundable
 22  3 but available for carryforward for up to five tax years.  The
 22  4 division makes the tax credit refundable for an investment
 22  5 made by a natural person, and for any other person reduces the
 22  6 carryforward period to three years.
 22  7    The division strikes a provision permitting the EDA
 22  8 to cooperate with small business development centers to
 22  9 disseminate information regarding the credits and to develop
 22 10 standard application forms, and requiring the EDA to distribute
 22 11 copies of the application forms to all community=based seed

 22 13    The division modifies the eligibility requirements for
 22 14 qualifying businesses.  The division strikes the requirement
 22 15 that a business have an owner that meets at least one of
 22 16 four qualifications relating to business education or
 22 17 business experience.  The division requires that a business
 22 18 be participating in an entrepreneurial assistance program,
 22 19 as defined in the division, but allows the EDA to waive this
 22 20 requirement if the business establishes that its owners,
 22 21 directors, officers, and employees have an appropriate level
 22 22 of experience such that an entrepreneurial assistance program
 22 23 would not materially change the prospects of the business.
 22 24 The EDA is allowed to consult with outside service providers
 22 25 in considering such a waiver.  The division increases from $5
 22 26 million to $10 million the maximum amount of net worth that
 22 27 a business may have to be considered a qualifying business.
 22 28 The division increases from $250,000 to $500,000 the amount of
 22 29 financing that a business must have in order to be considered a

 23 10 investment, and the total number and amount of tax credits
 23 11 issued shall be considered public information under Code

 25 13 The division provides that the amount of financial assistance
 25 14 awarded to any one provider shall not exceed $200,000.
 25 15    The division modifies the permitted use of funds received
 25 16 under the program.  Under current law, grants are only
 25 17 permitted to be used for the purpose of operating costs
 25 18 incurred by the program.  The division specifies that financial
 25 19 assistance awarded to a provider shall only be used for
 25 20 the purpose of operating costs incurred by the provider in
 25 21 the provision of business development services to emerging
 25 22 and early=stage innovation companies in Iowa.  The division
 25 23 further requires that such financial assistance shall not be
 25 24 distributed to owners or investors of the company to which the
 25 25 business development services are being provided and shall not
 25 26 be provided to other persons assisting with the provision of
 25 27 the services.
 25 28    Under current law, an entrepreneurial assistance provider is
 25 29 required to accept client referrals from the EDA as a condition
 25 30 of receiving a grant.  The division provides that the EDA may
 25 31 make client referrals to eligible providers.
 25 32    DIVISION IV ==== MISCELLANEOUS CHANGES.  Division IV makes
 25 33 several miscellaneous changes to other EDA programs.  The
 25 34 division amends the sales and use tax refund available under
 25 35 the workforce housing tax incentive program.  That refund
 26  1 is available for sales and use tax paid prior to project
 26  2 completion, which is currently defined to mean the first date
 26  3 upon which the average annualized production of finished
 26  4 product for the preceding 90=day period at the manufacturing
 26  5 facility operated by the eligible business is at least 50
 26  6 percent of the initial design capacity of the facility.  The
 26  7 division amends the definition of "project completion" to mean
 26  8 the date on which the EDA notifies the department of revenue
 26  9 that all applicable requirements of a workforce housing tax
 26 10 incentive program agreement are satisfied.  This provision
 26 11 takes effect upon enactment and applies retroactively to July
 26 12 1, 2014, for all workforce housing tax incentive agreements
 26 13 entered into on or after that date.
 26 14    The division allows the EDA to extend the project
 26 15 completion date for a project awarded tax incentives under the
 26 16 redevelopment tax credit program and the housing enterprise
 26 17 zone tax incentives program if the property that is the subject
 26 18 of the project suffered a catastrophic fire during the 2014
 26 19 calendar year.

 21 28 five investments in five different qualifying businesses.  The
 21 29 division amends this dollar limitation to prohibit a natural
 21 30 person and the person's spouse, child, or sibling from claiming
 21 31 a combined amount of more than $100,000 in tax credits per tax
 21 32 year.
 21 33    The division also provides that no more than $500,000 in tax
 21 34 credits may be issued per tax year for equity investments in
 21 35 any one qualifying business.
 22  1 The division modifies the procedures for claiming the tax
 22  2 credit.  Under current law, the tax credit is not refundable
 22  3 but available for carryforward for up to five tax years.  The
 22  4 division makes the tax credit refundable for an investment
 22  5 made by a natural person, and for any other person reduces the
 22  6 carryforward period to three years.
 22  7    The division strikes a provision permitting the EDA
 22  8 to cooperate with small business development centers to
 22  9 disseminate information regarding the credits and to develop
 22 10 standard application forms, and requiring the EDA to distribute
 22 11 copies of the application forms to all community=based seed
 22 12 capital funds and potential individual investors.
 22 13    The division modifies the eligibility requirements for
 22 14 qualifying businesses.  The division strikes the requirement
 22 15 that a business have an owner that meets at least one of
 22 16 four qualifications relating to business education or
 22 17 business experience.  The division requires that a business
 22 18 be participating in an entrepreneurial assistance program,
 22 19 as defined in the division, but allows the EDA to waive this
 22 20 requirement if the business establishes that its owners,
 22 21 directors, officers, and employees have an appropriate level
 22 22 of experience such that an entrepreneurial assistance program
 22 23 would not materially change the prospects of the business.
 22 24 The EDA is allowed to consult with outside service providers
 22 25 in considering such a waiver.  The division increases from $5
 22 26 million to $10 million the maximum amount of net worth that
 22 27 a business may have to be considered a qualifying business.
 22 28 The division increases from $250,000 to $500,000 the amount of
 22 29 financing that a business must have in order to be considered a
 22 30 qualifying business, removes "near equity" from the types of
 22 31 financing that will be considered in that calculation, requires
 22 32 that the financing be secured at the time of application for
 22 33 the tax credits, and requires that the business have at least
 22 34 two investors at the time of application for the tax credits.
 22 35 These modified eligibility requirements apply to businesses
 23  1 that submit an application to the EDA to be registered as a
 23  2 qualifying business on or after the effective date of this
 23  3 division of the bill, and businesses that submitted such an
 23  4 application to the EDA before the effective date of this
 23  5 division of the bill shall be governed by current law.
 23  6    The division provides for the confidentiality of certain
 23  7 information with regard to the tax credit.  The identity of
 23  8 a qualifying business, the identity of an investor and the
 23  9 qualifying business in which the investor made an equity
 23 10 investment, and the total number and amount of tax credits
 23 11 issued shall be considered public information under Code
 23 12 chapter 22 (examination of public records), but any other
 23 13 information or record in the possession of the EDA with respect
 23 14 to the program shall be presumed by the EDA to be a trade secret
 23 15 protected under Code chapter 550 or common law and shall be
 23 16 kept confidential by the EDA unless otherwise ordered by a
 23 17 court.
 23 18    The division takes effect upon enactment and applies to
 23 19 equity investments in a qualifying business made on or after
 23 20 that date.  Equity investments in a qualifying business or
 23 21 community=based seed capital fund made prior to the effective
 23 22 date of the division shall be governed by current law.
 23 23    DIVISION III ==== ENTREPRENEUR INVESTMENT AWARDS PROGRAM.
 23 24  Division III amends the entrepreneur investment awards program
 23 25 administered by the EDA.  The division strikes provisions that
 23 26 prohibited the EDA from making awards under the program since
 23 27 July 1, 2014, and that required the EDA by December 31, 2014,
 23 28 to conduct a comprehensive review of the program and submit
 23 29 a report with specified information to the governor and the
 23 30 general assembly.
 23 31    The division modifies the purpose of the program to be
 23 32 to provide financial assistance to eligible entrepreneurial
 23 33 assistance providers (provider) that provide technical and
 23 34 financial assistance to entrepreneurs and start=up companies
 23 35 seeking to create, locate, or expand a business in Iowa.
 24  1 "Financial assistance" is defined in the division.
 24  2    The division changes the requirements for receiving an
 24  3 award.  To be eligible to receive an award under current
 24  4 law, an entrepreneurial assistance program must have been
 24  5 an Iowa=based business, expended at least $500,000 during
 24  6 the previous fiscal year to provide technical and financial
 24  7 assistance services that meet the broad=based needs of
 24  8 entrepreneurs seeking to create, locate, or expand a business
 24  9 in Iowa that intends to derive more than 10 percent of its
 24 10 gross sales from markets outside Iowa; and must have engaged
 24 11 and communicated with certain other programs, funding sources,
 24 12 and entities for its entrepreneur clients.  The division
 24 13 amends the eligibility for receiving financial assistance to
 24 14 require that a provider have its principal place of operations
 24 15 in Iowa and that the provider offer a comprehensive set of
 24 16 business development services to emerging and early=stage
 24 17 innovation companies to assist in the creation, location,
 24 18 growth, and long=term success of the company in Iowa.
 24 19 "Business development services" is defined in the division.
 24 20 Business development services may be performed at the physical
 24 21 location of the provider or the company and may be provided in
 24 22 consideration of equity participation in the company, a fee for
 24 23 services, or a membership agreement with the company.
 24 24    Under current law, the EDA board could approve, deny, or
 24 25 defer each application for a grant, and was required to award
 24 26 grants on a first=come, first=served basis.  The division
 24 27 specifies that the EDA board has the discretion to approve,
 24 28 deny, or defer each application for financial assistance and
 24 29 that the amount of financial assistance awarded to a provider
 24 30 is within the discretion of the EDA.  The division requires
 24 31 the EDA to award financial assistance on a competitive basis
 24 32 and allows the EDA to develop scoring criteria and establish
 24 33 minimum requirements for the receipt of a financial assistance
 24 34 award.
 24 35    In addition to the four factors relating to the provider's
 25  1 professional staff that the EDA may consider under current
 25  2 law in deciding whether to award financial assistance, the
 25  3 division provides that the EDA may also consider the service
 25  4 model and likelihood of success of the provider, the provider's
 25  5 similarity to other successful providers in the country, and
 25  6 the provider's financial need.
 25  7    The division modifies the maximum award amount for a
 25  8 recipient.  Under current law, a grant to an entrepreneur
 25  9 assistance program cannot exceed the lesser of 25 percent of
 25 10 the funds expended by the program during the previous fiscal
 25 11 year, 100 percent of the funds raised from certain persons
 25 12 by the program during the previous fiscal year, or $200,000.
 25 13 The division provides that the amount of financial assistance
 25 14 awarded to any one provider shall not exceed $200,000.
 25 15    The division modifies the permitted use of funds received
 25 16 under the program.  Under current law, grants are only
 25 17 permitted to be used for the purpose of operating costs
 25 18 incurred by the program.  The division specifies that financial
 25 19 assistance awarded to a provider shall only be used for
 25 20 the purpose of operating costs incurred by the provider in
 25 21 the provision of business development services to emerging
 25 22 and early=stage innovation companies in Iowa.  The division
 25 23 further requires that such financial assistance shall not be
 25 24 distributed to owners or investors of the company to which the
 25 25 business development services are being provided and shall not
 25 26 be provided to other persons assisting with the provision of
 25 27 the services.
 25 28    Under current law, an entrepreneurial assistance provider is
 25 29 required to accept client referrals from the EDA as a condition
 25 30 of receiving a grant.  The division provides that the EDA may
 25 31 make client referrals to eligible providers.
 25 32    DIVISION IV ==== MISCELLANEOUS CHANGES.  Division IV makes
 25 33 several miscellaneous changes to other EDA programs.  The
 25 34 division amends the sales and use tax refund available under
 25 35 the workforce housing tax incentive program.  That refund
 26  1 is available for sales and use tax paid prior to project
 26  2 completion, which is currently defined to mean the first date
 26  3 upon which the average annualized production of finished
 26  4 product for the preceding 90=day period at the manufacturing
 26  5 facility operated by the eligible business is at least 50
 26  6 percent of the initial design capacity of the facility.  The
 26  7 division amends the definition of "project completion" to mean
 26  8 the date on which the EDA notifies the department of revenue
 26  9 that all applicable requirements of a workforce housing tax
 26 10 incentive program agreement are satisfied.  This provision
 26 11 takes effect upon enactment and applies retroactively to July
 26 12 1, 2014, for all workforce housing tax incentive agreements
 26 13 entered into on or after that date.
 26 14    The division allows the EDA to extend the project
 26 15 completion date for a project awarded tax incentives under the
 26 16 redevelopment tax credit program and the housing enterprise
 26 17 zone tax incentives program if the property that is the subject
 26 18 of the project suffered a catastrophic fire during the 2014
 26 19 calendar year.

 21 29 division amends this dollar limitation to prohibit a natural
 21 30 person and the person's spouse, child, or sibling from claiming
 21 31 a combined amount of more than $100,000 in tax credits per tax
 21 32 year.
 21 33    The division also provides that no more than $500,000 in tax
 21 34 credits may be issued per tax year for equity investments in
 21 35 any one qualifying business.
 22  1 The division modifies the procedures for claiming the tax
 22  2 credit.  Under current law, the tax credit is not refundable
 22  3 but available for carryforward for up to five tax years.  The
 22  4 division makes the tax credit refundable for an investment
 22  5 made by a natural person, and for any other person reduces the
 22  6 carryforward period to three years.
 22  7    The division strikes a provision permitting the EDA
 22  8 to cooperate with small business development centers to
 22  9 disseminate information regarding the credits and to develop
 22 10 standard application forms, and requiring the EDA to distribute
 22 11 copies of the application forms to all community=based seed
 22 12 capital funds and potential individual investors.
 22 13    The division modifies the eligibility requirements for
 22 14 qualifying businesses.  The division strikes the requirement
 22 15 that a business have an owner that meets at least one of
 22 16 four qualifications relating to business education or
 22 17 business experience.  The division requires that a business
 22 18 be participating in an entrepreneurial assistance program,
 22 19 as defined in the division, but allows the EDA to waive this
 22 20 requirement if the business establishes that its owners,
 22 21 directors, officers, and employees have an appropriate level
 22 22 of experience such that an entrepreneurial assistance program
 22 23 would not materially change the prospects of the business.
 22 24 The EDA is allowed to consult with outside service providers
 22 25 in considering such a waiver.  The division increases from $5
 22 26 million to $10 million the maximum amount of net worth that
 22 27 a business may have to be considered a qualifying business.
 22 28 The division increases from $250,000 to $500,000 the amount of
 22 29 financing that a business must have in order to be considered a
 22 30 qualifying business, removes "near equity" from the types of
 22 31 financing that will be considered in that calculation, requires
 22 32 that the financing be secured at the time of application for
 22 33 the tax credits, and requires that the business have at least
 22 34 two investors at the time of application for the tax credits.
 22 35 These modified eligibility requirements apply to businesses
 23  1 that submit an application to the EDA to be registered as a
 23  2 qualifying business on or after the effective date of this
 23  3 division of the bill, and businesses that submitted such an
 23  4 application to the EDA before the effective date of this
 23  5 division of the bill shall be governed by current law.
 23  6    The division provides for the confidentiality of certain
 23  7 information with regard to the tax credit.  The identity of
 23  8 a qualifying business, the identity of an investor and the
 23  9 qualifying business in which the investor made an equity
 23 10 investment, and the total number and amount of tax credits
 23 11 issued shall be considered public information under Code
 23 12 chapter 22 (examination of public records), but any other
 23 13 information or record in the possession of the EDA with respect
 23 14 to the program shall be presumed by the EDA to be a trade secret
 23 15 protected under Code chapter 550 or common law and shall be
 23 16 kept confidential by the EDA unless otherwise ordered by a
 23 17 court.
 23 18    The division takes effect upon enactment and applies to
 23 19 equity investments in a qualifying business made on or after
 23 20 that date.  Equity investments in a qualifying business or
 23 21 community=based seed capital fund made prior to the effective
 23 22 date of the division shall be governed by current law.
 23 23    DIVISION III ==== ENTREPRENEUR INVESTMENT AWARDS PROGRAM.
 23 24  Division III amends the entrepreneur investment awards program
 23 25 administered by the EDA.  The division strikes provisions that
 23 26 prohibited the EDA from making awards under the program since
 23 27 July 1, 2014, and that required the EDA by December 31, 2014,
 23 28 to conduct a comprehensive review of the program and submit

 23 33 assistance providers (provider) that provide technical and
 23 34 financial assistance to entrepreneurs and start=up companies
 23 35 seeking to create, locate, or expand a business in Iowa.

 24 15 in Iowa and that the provider offer a comprehensive set of
 24 16 business development services to emerging and early=stage
 24 17 innovation companies to assist in the creation, location,
 24 18 growth, and long=term success of the company in Iowa.
 24 19 "Business development services" is defined in the division.
 24 20 Business development services may be performed at the physical
 24 21 location of the provider or the company and may be provided in
 24 22 consideration of equity participation in the company, a fee for
 24 23 services, or a membership agreement with the company.
 24 24    Under current law, the EDA board could approve, deny, or
 24 25 defer each application for a grant, and was required to award
 24 26 grants on a first=come, first=served basis.  The division

 24 28 deny, or defer each application for financial assistance and
 24 29 that the amount of financial assistance awarded to a provider
 24 30 is within the discretion of the EDA.  The division requires

 25  5 similarity to other successful providers in the country, and

 25  9 assistance program cannot exceed the lesser of 25 percent of
 25 10 the funds expended by the program during the previous fiscal
 25 11 year, 100 percent of the funds raised from certain persons
 25 12 by the program during the previous fiscal year, or $200,000.
 25 13 The division provides that the amount of financial assistance
 25 14 awarded to any one provider shall not exceed $200,000.
 25 15    The division modifies the permitted use of funds received
 25 16 under the program.  Under current law, grants are only
 25 17 permitted to be used for the purpose of operating costs
 25 18 incurred by the program.  The division specifies that financial
 25 19 assistance awarded to a provider shall only be used for
 25 20 the purpose of operating costs incurred by the provider in
 25 21 the provision of business development services to emerging
 25 22 and early=stage innovation companies in Iowa.  The division

 25 24 distributed to owners or investors of the company to which the
 25 25 business development services are being provided and shall not

 25 27 the services.
 25 28    Under current law, an entrepreneurial assistance provider is
 25 29 required to accept client referrals from the EDA as a condition
 25 30 of receiving a grant.  The division provides that the EDA may

 25 32    DIVISION IV ==== MISCELLANEOUS CHANGES.  Division IV makes

 22 13    The division modifies the eligibility requirements for
 22 14 qualifying businesses.  The division strikes the requirement
 22 15 that a business have an owner that meets at least one of

 22 24 The EDA is allowed to consult with outside service providers

 23 19 equity investments in a qualifying business made on or after
 23 20 that date.  Equity investments in a qualifying business or
 23 21 community=based seed capital fund made prior to the effective
 23 22 date of the division shall be governed by current law.
 23 23    DIVISION III ==== ENTREPRENEUR INVESTMENT AWARDS PROGRAM.
 23 24  Division III amends the entrepreneur investment awards program
 23 25 administered by the EDA.  The division strikes provisions that
 23 26 prohibited the EDA from making awards under the program since
 23 27 July 1, 2014, and that required the EDA by December 31, 2014,
 23 28 to conduct a comprehensive review of the program and submit
 23 29 a report with specified information to the governor and the
 23 30 general assembly.
 23 31    The division modifies the purpose of the program to be
 23 32 to provide financial assistance to eligible entrepreneurial
 23 33 assistance providers (provider) that provide technical and
 23 34 financial assistance to entrepreneurs and start=up companies
 23 35 seeking to create, locate, or expand a business in Iowa.
 24  1 "Financial assistance" is defined in the division.
 24  2    The division changes the requirements for receiving an
 24  3 award.  To be eligible to receive an award under current
 24  4 law, an entrepreneurial assistance program must have been
 24  5 an Iowa=based business, expended at least $500,000 during
 24  6 the previous fiscal year to provide technical and financial
 24  7 assistance services that meet the broad=based needs of
 24  8 entrepreneurs seeking to create, locate, or expand a business
 24  9 in Iowa that intends to derive more than 10 percent of its
 24 10 gross sales from markets outside Iowa; and must have engaged
 24 11 and communicated with certain other programs, funding sources,
 24 12 and entities for its entrepreneur clients.  The division
 24 13 amends the eligibility for receiving financial assistance to
 24 14 require that a provider have its principal place of operations
 24 15 in Iowa and that the provider offer a comprehensive set of
 24 16 business development services to emerging and early=stage
 24 17 innovation companies to assist in the creation, location,
 24 18 growth, and long=term success of the company in Iowa.
 24 19 "Business development services" is defined in the division.
 24 20 Business development services may be performed at the physical
 24 21 location of the provider or the company and may be provided in
 24 22 consideration of equity participation in the company, a fee for
 24 23 services, or a membership agreement with the company.
 24 24    Under current law, the EDA board could approve, deny, or
 24 25 defer each application for a grant, and was required to award
 24 26 grants on a first=come, first=served basis.  The division
 24 27 specifies that the EDA board has the discretion to approve,
 24 28 deny, or defer each application for financial assistance and
 24 29 that the amount of financial assistance awarded to a provider
 24 30 is within the discretion of the EDA.  The division requires
 24 31 the EDA to award financial assistance on a competitive basis
 24 32 and allows the EDA to develop scoring criteria and establish
 24 33 minimum requirements for the receipt of a financial assistance
 24 34 award.
 24 35    In addition to the four factors relating to the provider's
 25  1 professional staff that the EDA may consider under current
 25  2 law in deciding whether to award financial assistance, the
 25  3 division provides that the EDA may also consider the service
 25  4 model and likelihood of success of the provider, the provider's
 25  5 similarity to other successful providers in the country, and
 25  6 the provider's financial need.
 25  7    The division modifies the maximum award amount for a
 25  8 recipient.  Under current law, a grant to an entrepreneur
 25  9 assistance program cannot exceed the lesser of 25 percent of
 25 10 the funds expended by the program during the previous fiscal
 25 11 year, 100 percent of the funds raised from certain persons
 25 12 by the program during the previous fiscal year, or $200,000.
 25 13 The division provides that the amount of financial assistance
 25 14 awarded to any one provider shall not exceed $200,000.
 25 15    The division modifies the permitted use of funds received
 25 16 under the program.  Under current law, grants are only
 25 17 permitted to be used for the purpose of operating costs
 25 18 incurred by the program.  The division specifies that financial
 25 19 assistance awarded to a provider shall only be used for
 25 20 the purpose of operating costs incurred by the provider in
 25 21 the provision of business development services to emerging
 25 22 and early=stage innovation companies in Iowa.  The division
 25 23 further requires that such financial assistance shall not be
 25 24 distributed to owners or investors of the company to which the
 25 25 business development services are being provided and shall not
 25 26 be provided to other persons assisting with the provision of
 25 27 the services.
 25 28    Under current law, an entrepreneurial assistance provider is
 25 29 required to accept client referrals from the EDA as a condition
 25 30 of receiving a grant.  The division provides that the EDA may
 25 31 make client referrals to eligible providers.
 25 32    DIVISION IV ==== MISCELLANEOUS CHANGES.  Division IV makes
 25 33 several miscellaneous changes to other EDA programs.  The
 25 34 division amends the sales and use tax refund available under
 25 35 the workforce housing tax incentive program.  That refund
 26  1 is available for sales and use tax paid prior to project
 26  2 completion, which is currently defined to mean the first date
 26  3 upon which the average annualized production of finished
 26  4 product for the preceding 90=day period at the manufacturing
 26  5 facility operated by the eligible business is at least 50
 26  6 percent of the initial design capacity of the facility.  The
 26  7 division amends the definition of "project completion" to mean
 26  8 the date on which the EDA notifies the department of revenue
 26  9 that all applicable requirements of a workforce housing tax
 26 10 incentive program agreement are satisfied.  This provision
 26 11 takes effect upon enactment and applies retroactively to July
 26 12 1, 2014, for all workforce housing tax incentive agreements
 26 13 entered into on or after that date.
 26 14    The division allows the EDA to extend the project
 26 15 completion date for a project awarded tax incentives under the
 26 16 redevelopment tax credit program and the housing enterprise
 26 17 zone tax incentives program if the property that is the subject
 26 18 of the project suffered a catastrophic fire during the 2014
 26 19 calendar year.

       mm/sc
 21 31 a combined amount of more than $100,000 in tax credits per tax
 21 32 year.
 21 33    The division also provides that no more than $500,000 in tax
 21 34 credits may be issued per tax year for equity investments in
 21 35 any one qualifying business.
 22  1 The division modifies the procedures for claiming the tax
 22  2 credit.  Under current law, the tax credit is not refundable
 22  3 but available for carryforward for up to five tax years.  The
 22  4 division makes the tax credit refundable for an investment
 22  5 made by a natural person, and for any other person reduces the
 22  6 carryforward period to three years.
 22  7    The division strikes a provision permitting the EDA
 22  8 to cooperate with small business development centers to
 22  9 disseminate information regarding the credits and to develop
 22 10 standard application forms, and requiring the EDA to distribute
 22 11 copies of the application forms to all community=based seed
 22 12 capital funds and potential individual investors.
 22 13    The division modifies the eligibility requirements for
 22 14 qualifying businesses.  The division strikes the requirement
 22 15 that a business have an owner that meets at least one of
 22 16 four qualifications relating to business education or
 22 17 business experience.  The division requires that a business
 22 18 be participating in an entrepreneurial assistance program,
 22 19 as defined in the division, but allows the EDA to waive this
 22 20 requirement if the business establishes that its owners,
 22 21 directors, officers, and employees have an appropriate level
 22 22 of experience such that an entrepreneurial assistance program
 22 23 would not materially change the prospects of the business.
 22 24 The EDA is allowed to consult with outside service providers
 22 25 in considering such a waiver.  The division increases from $5
 22 26 million to $10 million the maximum amount of net worth that
 22 27 a business may have to be considered a qualifying business.
 22 28 The division increases from $250,000 to $500,000 the amount of
 22 29 financing that a business must have in order to be considered a
 22 30 qualifying business, removes "near equity" from the types of
 22 31 financing that will be considered in that calculation, requires
 22 32 that the financing be secured at the time of application for
 22 33 the tax credits, and requires that the business have at least
 22 34 two investors at the time of application for the tax credits.
 22 35 These modified eligibility requirements apply to businesses
 23  1 that submit an application to the EDA to be registered as a
 23  2 qualifying business on or after the effective date of this
 23  3 division of the bill, and businesses that submitted such an
 23  4 application to the EDA before the effective date of this
 23  5 division of the bill shall be governed by current law.
 23  6    The division provides for the confidentiality of certain
 23  7 information with regard to the tax credit.  The identity of
 23  8 a qualifying business, the identity of an investor and the
 23  9 qualifying business in which the investor made an equity
 23 10 investment, and the total number and amount of tax credits
 23 11 issued shall be considered public information under Code
 23 12 chapter 22 (examination of public records), but any other
 23 13 information or record in the possession of the EDA with respect
 23 14 to the program shall be presumed by the EDA to be a trade secret
 23 15 protected under Code chapter 550 or common law and shall be
 23 16 kept confidential by the EDA unless otherwise ordered by a
 23 17 court.
 23 18    The division takes effect upon enactment and applies to
 23 19 equity investments in a qualifying business made on or after
 23 20 that date.  Equity investments in a qualifying business or
 23 21 community=based seed capital fund made prior to the effective
 23 22 date of the division shall be governed by current law.
 23 23    DIVISION III ==== ENTREPRENEUR INVESTMENT AWARDS PROGRAM.
 23 24  Division III amends the entrepreneur investment awards program
 23 25 administered by the EDA.  The division strikes provisions that

 24 10 gross sales from markets outside Iowa; and must have engaged
 24 11 and communicated with certain other programs, funding sources,

 24 13 amends the eligibility for receiving financial assistance to
 24 14 require that a provider have its principal place of operations
 24 15 in Iowa and that the provider offer a comprehensive set of
 24 16 business development services to emerging and early=stage
 24 17 innovation companies to assist in the creation, location,
 24 18 growth, and long=term success of the company in Iowa.
 24 19 "Business development services" is defined in the division.
 24 20 Business development services may be performed at the physical
 24 21 location of the provider or the company and may be provided in
 24 22 consideration of equity participation in the company, a fee for
 24 23 services, or a membership agreement with the company.
 24 24    Under current law, the EDA board could approve, deny, or
 24 25 defer each application for a grant, and was required to award
 24 26 grants on a first=come, first=served basis.  The division
 24 27 specifies that the EDA board has the discretion to approve,
 24 28 deny, or defer each application for financial assistance and
 24 29 that the amount of financial assistance awarded to a provider
 24 30 is within the discretion of the EDA.  The division requires
 24 31 the EDA to award financial assistance on a competitive basis
 24 32 and allows the EDA to develop scoring criteria and establish
 24 33 minimum requirements for the receipt of a financial assistance
 24 34 award.
 24 35    In addition to the four factors relating to the provider's
 25  1 professional staff that the EDA may consider under current
 25  2 law in deciding whether to award financial assistance, the
 25  3 division provides that the EDA may also consider the service
 25  4 model and likelihood of success of the provider, the provider's
 25  5 similarity to other successful providers in the country, and
 25  6 the provider's financial need.
 25  7    The division modifies the maximum award amount for a
 25  8 recipient.  Under current law, a grant to an entrepreneur
 25  9 assistance program cannot exceed the lesser of 25 percent of
 25 10 the funds expended by the program during the previous fiscal
 25 11 year, 100 percent of the funds raised from certain persons
 25 12 by the program during the previous fiscal year, or $200,000.
 25 13 The division provides that the amount of financial assistance
 25 14 awarded to any one provider shall not exceed $200,000.
 25 15    The division modifies the permitted use of funds received
 25 16 under the program.  Under current law, grants are only

 25 18 incurred by the program.  The division specifies that financial
 25 19 assistance awarded to a provider shall only be used for
 25 20 the purpose of operating costs incurred by the provider in
 25 21 the provision of business development services to emerging
 25 22 and early=stage innovation companies in Iowa.  The division
 25 23 further requires that such financial assistance shall not be
 25 24 distributed to owners or investors of the company to which the
 25 25 business development services are being provided and shall not
 25 26 be provided to other persons assisting with the provision of
 25 27 the services.
 25 28    Under current law, an entrepreneurial assistance provider is
 25 29 required to accept client referrals from the EDA as a condition

 21 33    The division also provides that no more than $500,000 in tax
 21 34 credits may be issued per tax year for equity investments in
 21 35 any one qualifying business.
 22  1 The division modifies the procedures for claiming the tax
 22  2 credit.  Under current law, the tax credit is not refundable
 22  3 but available for carryforward for up to five tax years.  The
 22  4 division makes the tax credit refundable for an investment
 22  5 made by a natural person, and for any other person reduces the
 22  6 carryforward period to three years.
 22  7    The division strikes a provision permitting the EDA
 22  8 to cooperate with small business development centers to
 22  9 disseminate information regarding the credits and to develop
 22 10 standard application forms, and requiring the EDA to distribute
 22 11 copies of the application forms to all community=based seed
 22 12 capital funds and potential individual investors.
 22 13    The division modifies the eligibility requirements for
 22 14 qualifying businesses.  The division strikes the requirement
 22 15 that a business have an owner that meets at least one of
 22 16 four qualifications relating to business education or
 22 17 business experience.  The division requires that a business
 22 18 be participating in an entrepreneurial assistance program,
 22 19 as defined in the division, but allows the EDA to waive this
 22 20 requirement if the business establishes that its owners,
 22 21 directors, officers, and employees have an appropriate level
 22 22 of experience such that an entrepreneurial assistance program
 22 23 would not materially change the prospects of the business.
 22 24 The EDA is allowed to consult with outside service providers
 22 25 in considering such a waiver.  The division increases from $5
 22 26 million to $10 million the maximum amount of net worth that
 22 27 a business may have to be considered a qualifying business.
 22 28 The division increases from $250,000 to $500,000 the amount of
 22 29 financing that a business must have in order to be considered a
 22 30 qualifying business, removes "near equity" from the types of
 22 31 financing that will be considered in that calculation, requires
 22 32 that the financing be secured at the time of application for
 22 33 the tax credits, and requires that the business have at least
 22 34 two investors at the time of application for the tax credits.
 22 35 These modified eligibility requirements apply to businesses
 23  1 that submit an application to the EDA to be registered as a
 23  2 qualifying business on or after the effective date of this
 23  3 division of the bill, and businesses that submitted such an
 23  4 application to the EDA before the effective date of this
 23  5 division of the bill shall be governed by current law.
 23  6    The division provides for the confidentiality of certain
 23  7 information with regard to the tax credit.  The identity of
 23  8 a qualifying business, the identity of an investor and the
 23  9 qualifying business in which the investor made an equity
 23 10 investment, and the total number and amount of tax credits
 23 11 issued shall be considered public information under Code
 23 12 chapter 22 (examination of public records), but any other
 23 13 information or record in the possession of the EDA with respect
 23 14 to the program shall be presumed by the EDA to be a trade secret
 23 15 protected under Code chapter 550 or common law and shall be
 23 16 kept confidential by the EDA unless otherwise ordered by a
 23 17 court.
 23 18    The division takes effect upon enactment and applies to
 23 19 equity investments in a qualifying business made on or after
 23 20 that date.  Equity investments in a qualifying business or
 23 21 community=based seed capital fund made prior to the effective
 23 22 date of the division shall be governed by current law.
 23 23    DIVISION III ==== ENTREPRENEUR INVESTMENT AWARDS PROGRAM.
 23 24  Division III amends the entrepreneur investment awards program
 23 25 administered by the EDA.  The division strikes provisions that
 23 26 prohibited the EDA from making awards under the program since
 23 27 July 1, 2014, and that required the EDA by December 31, 2014,
 23 28 to conduct a comprehensive review of the program and submit
 23 29 a report with specified information to the governor and the
 23 30 general assembly.
 23 31    The division modifies the purpose of the program to be
 23 32 to provide financial assistance to eligible entrepreneurial
 23 33 assistance providers (provider) that provide technical and
 23 34 financial assistance to entrepreneurs and start=up companies
 23 35 seeking to create, locate, or expand a business in Iowa.
 24  1 "Financial assistance" is defined in the division.
 24  2    The division changes the requirements for receiving an
 24  3 award.  To be eligible to receive an award under current
 24  4 law, an entrepreneurial assistance program must have been
 24  5 an Iowa=based business, expended at least $500,000 during
 24  6 the previous fiscal year to provide technical and financial
 24  7 assistance services that meet the broad=based needs of
 24  8 entrepreneurs seeking to create, locate, or expand a business
 24  9 in Iowa that intends to derive more than 10 percent of its
 24 10 gross sales from markets outside Iowa; and must have engaged
 24 11 and communicated with certain other programs, funding sources,
 24 12 and entities for its entrepreneur clients.  The division
 24 13 amends the eligibility for receiving financial assistance to
 24 14 require that a provider have its principal place of operations
 24 15 in Iowa and that the provider offer a comprehensive set of
 24 16 business development services to emerging and early=stage
 24 17 innovation companies to assist in the creation, location,
 24 18 growth, and long=term success of the company in Iowa.
 24 19 "Business development services" is defined in the division.
 24 20 Business development services may be performed at the physical
 24 21 location of the provider or the company and may be provided in
 24 22 consideration of equity participation in the company, a fee for
 24 23 services, or a membership agreement with the company.
 24 24    Under current law, the EDA board could approve, deny, or
 24 25 defer each application for a grant, and was required to award
 24 26 grants on a first=come, first=served basis.  The division
 24 27 specifies that the EDA board has the discretion to approve,
 24 28 deny, or defer each application for financial assistance and
 24 29 that the amount of financial assistance awarded to a provider
 24 30 is within the discretion of the EDA.  The division requires
 24 31 the EDA to award financial assistance on a competitive basis
 24 32 and allows the EDA to develop scoring criteria and establish
 24 33 minimum requirements for the receipt of a financial assistance
 24 34 award.
 24 35    In addition to the four factors relating to the provider's
 25  1 professional staff that the EDA may consider under current
 25  2 law in deciding whether to award financial assistance, the
 25  3 division provides that the EDA may also consider the service
 25  4 model and likelihood of success of the provider, the provider's
 25  5 similarity to other successful providers in the country, and
 25  6 the provider's financial need.
 25  7    The division modifies the maximum award amount for a
 25  8 recipient.  Under current law, a grant to an entrepreneur
 25  9 assistance program cannot exceed the lesser of 25 percent of
 25 10 the funds expended by the program during the previous fiscal
 25 11 year, 100 percent of the funds raised from certain persons
 25 12 by the program during the previous fiscal year, or $200,000.
 25 13 The division provides that the amount of financial assistance
 25 14 awarded to any one provider shall not exceed $200,000.
 25 15    The division modifies the permitted use of funds received
 25 16 under the program.  Under current law, grants are only
 25 17 permitted to be used for the purpose of operating costs
 25 18 incurred by the program.  The division specifies that financial
 25 19 assistance awarded to a provider shall only be used for
 25 20 the purpose of operating costs incurred by the provider in
 25 21 the provision of business development services to emerging
 25 22 and early=stage innovation companies in Iowa.  The division
 25 23 further requires that such financial assistance shall not be
 25 24 distributed to owners or investors of the company to which the
 25 25 business development services are being provided and shall not
 25 26 be provided to other persons assisting with the provision of
 25 27 the services.
 25 28    Under current law, an entrepreneurial assistance provider is
 25 29 required to accept client referrals from the EDA as a condition
 25 30 of receiving a grant.  The division provides that the EDA may
 25 31 make client referrals to eligible providers.
 25 32    DIVISION IV ==== MISCELLANEOUS CHANGES.  Division IV makes
 25 33 several miscellaneous changes to other EDA programs.  The
 25 34 division amends the sales and use tax refund available under
 25 35 the workforce housing tax incentive program.  That refund
 26  1 is available for sales and use tax paid prior to project
 26  2 completion, which is currently defined to mean the first date
 26  3 upon which the average annualized production of finished
 26  4 product for the preceding 90=day period at the manufacturing
 26  5 facility operated by the eligible business is at least 50
 26  6 percent of the initial design capacity of the facility.  The
 26  7 division amends the definition of "project completion" to mean
 26  8 the date on which the EDA notifies the department of revenue
 26  9 that all applicable requirements of a workforce housing tax
 26 10 incentive program agreement are satisfied.  This provision
 26 11 takes effect upon enactment and applies retroactively to July
 26 12 1, 2014, for all workforce housing tax incentive agreements
 26 13 entered into on or after that date.
 26 14    The division allows the EDA to extend the project
 26 15 completion date for a project awarded tax incentives under the
 26 16 redevelopment tax credit program and the housing enterprise
 26 17 zone tax incentives program if the property that is the subject
 26 18 of the project suffered a catastrophic fire during the 2014
 26 19 calendar year.

 23  8 a qualifying business, the identity of an investor and the
 23  9 qualifying business in which the investor made an equity
 23 10 investment, and the total number and amount of tax credits
 23 11 issued shall be considered public information under Code

 24 33 minimum requirements for the receipt of a financial assistance
 24 34 award.
 24 35    In addition to the four factors relating to the provider's
 25  1 professional staff that the EDA may consider under current
 25  2 law in deciding whether to award financial assistance, the
 25  3 division provides that the EDA may also consider the service
 25  4 model and likelihood of success of the provider, the provider's
 25  5 similarity to other successful providers in the country, and
 25  6 the provider's financial need.
 25  7    The division modifies the maximum award amount for a
 25  8 recipient.  Under current law, a grant to an entrepreneur
 25  9 assistance program cannot exceed the lesser of 25 percent of
 25 10 the funds expended by the program during the previous fiscal
 25 11 year, 100 percent of the funds raised from certain persons
 25 12 by the program during the previous fiscal year, or $200,000.
 25 13 The division provides that the amount of financial assistance
 25 14 awarded to any one provider shall not exceed $200,000.
 25 15    The division modifies the permitted use of funds received
 25 16 under the program.  Under current law, grants are only
 25 17 permitted to be used for the purpose of operating costs
 25 18 incurred by the program.  The division specifies that financial
 25 19 assistance awarded to a provider shall only be used for
 25 20 the purpose of operating costs incurred by the provider in
 25 21 the provision of business development services to emerging
 25 22 and early=stage innovation companies in Iowa.  The division
 25 23 further requires that such financial assistance shall not be
 25 24 distributed to owners or investors of the company to which the
 25 25 business development services are being provided and shall not
 25 26 be provided to other persons assisting with the provision of
 25 27 the services.
 25 28    Under current law, an entrepreneurial assistance provider is
 25 29 required to accept client referrals from the EDA as a condition
 25 30 of receiving a grant.  The division provides that the EDA may
 25 31 make client referrals to eligible providers.
 25 32    DIVISION IV ==== MISCELLANEOUS CHANGES.  Division IV makes
 25 33 several miscellaneous changes to other EDA programs.  The
 25 34 division amends the sales and use tax refund available under
 25 35 the workforce housing tax incentive program.  That refund
 26  1 is available for sales and use tax paid prior to project
 26  2 completion, which is currently defined to mean the first date
 26  3 upon which the average annualized production of finished
 26  4 product for the preceding 90=day period at the manufacturing
 26  5 facility operated by the eligible business is at least 50
 26  6 percent of the initial design capacity of the facility.  The
 26  7 division amends the definition of "project completion" to mean
 26  8 the date on which the EDA notifies the department of revenue
 26  9 that all applicable requirements of a workforce housing tax
 26 10 incentive program agreement are satisfied.  This provision
 26 11 takes effect upon enactment and applies retroactively to July
 26 12 1, 2014, for all workforce housing tax incentive agreements
 26 13 entered into on or after that date.
 26 14    The division allows the EDA to extend the project
 26 15 completion date for a project awarded tax incentives under the
 26 16 redevelopment tax credit program and the housing enterprise
 26 17 zone tax incentives program if the property that is the subject
 26 18 of the project suffered a catastrophic fire during the 2014
 26 19 calendar year.
       LSB 1212HV (3) 86
       mm/sc
 22  1 The division modifies the procedures for claiming the tax
 22  2 credit.  Under current law, the tax credit is not refundable
 22  3 but available for carryforward for up to five tax years.  The
 22  4 division makes the tax credit refundable for an investment
 22  5 made by a natural person, and for any other person reduces the
 22  6 carryforward period to three years.
 22  7    The division strikes a provision permitting the EDA
 22  8 to cooperate with small business development centers to
 22  9 disseminate information regarding the credits and to develop
 22 10 standard application forms, and requiring the EDA to distribute
 22 11 copies of the application forms to all community=based seed
 22 12 capital funds and potential individual investors.
 22 13    The division modifies the eligibility requirements for
 22 14 qualifying businesses.  The division strikes the requirement
 22 15 that a business have an owner that meets at least one of
 22 16 four qualifications relating to business education or
 22 17 business experience.  The division requires that a business
 22 18 be participating in an entrepreneurial assistance program,
 22 19 as defined in the division, but allows the EDA to waive this
 22 20 requirement if the business establishes that its owners,
 22 21 directors, officers, and employees have an appropriate level
 22 22 of experience such that an entrepreneurial assistance program
 22 23 would not materially change the prospects of the business.
 22 24 The EDA is allowed to consult with outside service providers
 22 25 in considering such a waiver.  The division increases from $5
 22 26 million to $10 million the maximum amount of net worth that
 22 27 a business may have to be considered a qualifying business.
 22 28 The division increases from $250,000 to $500,000 the amount of
 22 29 financing that a business must have in order to be considered a
 22 30 qualifying business, removes "near equity" from the types of
 22 31 financing that will be considered in that calculation, requires
 22 32 that the financing be secured at the time of application for
 22 33 the tax credits, and requires that the business have at least
 22 34 two investors at the time of application for the tax credits.
 22 35 These modified eligibility requirements apply to businesses
 23  1 that submit an application to the EDA to be registered as a
 23  2 qualifying business on or after the effective date of this
 23  3 division of the bill, and businesses that submitted such an
 23  4 application to the EDA before the effective date of this
 23  5 division of the bill shall be governed by current law.
 23  6    The division provides for the confidentiality of certain
 23  7 information with regard to the tax credit.  The identity of
 23  8 a qualifying business, the identity of an investor and the
 23  9 qualifying business in which the investor made an equity
 23 10 investment, and the total number and amount of tax credits
 23 11 issued shall be considered public information under Code
 23 12 chapter 22 (examination of public records), but any other
 23 13 information or record in the possession of the EDA with respect
 23 14 to the program shall be presumed by the EDA to be a trade secret
 23 15 protected under Code chapter 550 or common law and shall be
 23 16 kept confidential by the EDA unless otherwise ordered by a
 23 17 court.
 23 18    The division takes effect upon enactment and applies to
 23 19 equity investments in a qualifying business made on or after
 23 20 that date.  Equity investments in a qualifying business or
 23 21 community=based seed capital fund made prior to the effective
 23 22 date of the division shall be governed by current law.
 23 23    DIVISION III ==== ENTREPRENEUR INVESTMENT AWARDS PROGRAM.
 23 24  Division III amends the entrepreneur investment awards program
 23 25 administered by the EDA.  The division strikes provisions that
 23 26 prohibited the EDA from making awards under the program since
 23 27 July 1, 2014, and that required the EDA by December 31, 2014,
 23 28 to conduct a comprehensive review of the program and submit
 23 29 a report with specified information to the governor and the
 23 30 general assembly.
 23 31    The division modifies the purpose of the program to be
 23 32 to provide financial assistance to eligible entrepreneurial
 23 33 assistance providers (provider) that provide technical and
 23 34 financial assistance to entrepreneurs and start=up companies
 23 35 seeking to create, locate, or expand a business in Iowa.
 24  1 "Financial assistance" is defined in the division.
 24  2    The division changes the requirements for receiving an
 24  3 award.  To be eligible to receive an award under current
 24  4 law, an entrepreneurial assistance program must have been
 24  5 an Iowa=based business, expended at least $500,000 during
 24  6 the previous fiscal year to provide technical and financial
 24  7 assistance services that meet the broad=based needs of
 24  8 entrepreneurs seeking to create, locate, or expand a business
 24  9 in Iowa that intends to derive more than 10 percent of its
 24 10 gross sales from markets outside Iowa; and must have engaged
 24 11 and communicated with certain other programs, funding sources,
 24 12 and entities for its entrepreneur clients.  The division
 24 13 amends the eligibility for receiving financial assistance to
 24 14 require that a provider have its principal place of operations
 24 15 in Iowa and that the provider offer a comprehensive set of
 24 16 business development services to emerging and early=stage
 24 17 innovation companies to assist in the creation, location,
 24 18 growth, and long=term success of the company in Iowa.
 24 19 "Business development services" is defined in the division.
 24 20 Business development services may be performed at the physical
 24 21 location of the provider or the company and may be provided in
 24 22 consideration of equity participation in the company, a fee for
 24 23 services, or a membership agreement with the company.
 24 24    Under current law, the EDA board could approve, deny, or
 24 25 defer each application for a grant, and was required to award
 24 26 grants on a first=come, first=served basis.  The division
 24 27 specifies that the EDA board has the discretion to approve,
 24 28 deny, or defer each application for financial assistance and
 24 29 that the amount of financial assistance awarded to a provider
 24 30 is within the discretion of the EDA.  The division requires
 24 31 the EDA to award financial assistance on a competitive basis
 24 32 and allows the EDA to develop scoring criteria and establish
 24 33 minimum requirements for the receipt of a financial assistance
 24 34 award.
 24 35    In addition to the four factors relating to the provider's
 25  1 professional staff that the EDA may consider under current
 25  2 law in deciding whether to award financial assistance, the
 25  3 division provides that the EDA may also consider the service
 25  4 model and likelihood of success of the provider, the provider's
 25  5 similarity to other successful providers in the country, and
 25  6 the provider's financial need.
 25  7    The division modifies the maximum award amount for a
 25  8 recipient.  Under current law, a grant to an entrepreneur
 25  9 assistance program cannot exceed the lesser of 25 percent of
 25 10 the funds expended by the program during the previous fiscal
 25 11 year, 100 percent of the funds raised from certain persons
 25 12 by the program during the previous fiscal year, or $200,000.
 25 13 The division provides that the amount of financial assistance
 25 14 awarded to any one provider shall not exceed $200,000.
 25 15    The division modifies the permitted use of funds received
 25 16 under the program.  Under current law, grants are only
 25 17 permitted to be used for the purpose of operating costs
 25 18 incurred by the program.  The division specifies that financial
 25 19 assistance awarded to a provider shall only be used for
 25 20 the purpose of operating costs incurred by the provider in
 25 21 the provision of business development services to emerging
 25 22 and early=stage innovation companies in Iowa.  The division
 25 23 further requires that such financial assistance shall not be
 25 24 distributed to owners or investors of the company to which the
 25 25 business development services are being provided and shall not
 25 26 be provided to other persons assisting with the provision of
 25 27 the services.
 25 28    Under current law, an entrepreneurial assistance provider is
 25 29 required to accept client referrals from the EDA as a condition
 25 30 of receiving a grant.  The division provides that the EDA may
 25 31 make client referrals to eligible providers.
 25 32    DIVISION IV ==== MISCELLANEOUS CHANGES.  Division IV makes

 26  7 division amends the definition of "project completion" to mean
 26  8 the date on which the EDA notifies the department of revenue
 26  9 that all applicable requirements of a workforce housing tax
 26 10 incentive program agreement are satisfied.  This provision
 26 11 takes effect upon enactment and applies retroactively to July

 23 23    DIVISION III ==== ENTREPRENEUR INVESTMENT AWARDS PROGRAM.
 23 24  Division III amends the entrepreneur investment awards program
 23 25 administered by the EDA.  The division strikes provisions that
 23 26 prohibited the EDA from making awards under the program since
 23 27 July 1, 2014, and that required the EDA by December 31, 2014,
 23 28 to conduct a comprehensive review of the program and submit
 23 29 a report with specified information to the governor and the
 23 30 general assembly.
 23 31    The division modifies the purpose of the program to be
 23 32 to provide financial assistance to eligible entrepreneurial
 23 33 assistance providers (provider) that provide technical and
 23 34 financial assistance to entrepreneurs and start=up companies
 23 35 seeking to create, locate, or expand a business in Iowa.
 24  1 "Financial assistance" is defined in the division.
 24  2    The division changes the requirements for receiving an
 24  3 award.  To be eligible to receive an award under current
 24  4 law, an entrepreneurial assistance program must have been
 24  5 an Iowa=based business, expended at least $500,000 during
 24  6 the previous fiscal year to provide technical and financial
 24  7 assistance services that meet the broad=based needs of
 24  8 entrepreneurs seeking to create, locate, or expand a business
 24  9 in Iowa that intends to derive more than 10 percent of its
 24 10 gross sales from markets outside Iowa; and must have engaged
 24 11 and communicated with certain other programs, funding sources,
 24 12 and entities for its entrepreneur clients.  The division
 24 13 amends the eligibility for receiving financial assistance to
 24 14 require that a provider have its principal place of operations
 24 15 in Iowa and that the provider offer a comprehensive set of
 24 16 business development services to emerging and early=stage
 24 17 innovation companies to assist in the creation, location,
 24 18 growth, and long=term success of the company in Iowa.
 24 19 "Business development services" is defined in the division.
 24 20 Business development services may be performed at the physical
 24 21 location of the provider or the company and may be provided in
 24 22 consideration of equity participation in the company, a fee for
 24 23 services, or a membership agreement with the company.
 24 24    Under current law, the EDA board could approve, deny, or
 24 25 defer each application for a grant, and was required to award
 24 26 grants on a first=come, first=served basis.  The division
 24 27 specifies that the EDA board has the discretion to approve,
 24 28 deny, or defer each application for financial assistance and
 24 29 that the amount of financial assistance awarded to a provider
 24 30 is within the discretion of the EDA.  The division requires
 24 31 the EDA to award financial assistance on a competitive basis
 24 32 and allows the EDA to develop scoring criteria and establish
 24 33 minimum requirements for the receipt of a financial assistance
 24 34 award.
 24 35    In addition to the four factors relating to the provider's
 25  1 professional staff that the EDA may consider under current
 25  2 law in deciding whether to award financial assistance, the
 25  3 division provides that the EDA may also consider the service
 25  4 model and likelihood of success of the provider, the provider's
 25  5 similarity to other successful providers in the country, and
 25  6 the provider's financial need.
 25  7    The division modifies the maximum award amount for a
 25  8 recipient.  Under current law, a grant to an entrepreneur
 25  9 assistance program cannot exceed the lesser of 25 percent of
 25 10 the funds expended by the program during the previous fiscal
 25 11 year, 100 percent of the funds raised from certain persons
 25 12 by the program during the previous fiscal year, or $200,000.
 25 13 The division provides that the amount of financial assistance
 25 14 awarded to any one provider shall not exceed $200,000.
 25 15    The division modifies the permitted use of funds received
 25 16 under the program.  Under current law, grants are only
 25 17 permitted to be used for the purpose of operating costs
 25 18 incurred by the program.  The division specifies that financial
 25 19 assistance awarded to a provider shall only be used for
 25 20 the purpose of operating costs incurred by the provider in
 25 21 the provision of business development services to emerging
 25 22 and early=stage innovation companies in Iowa.  The division
 25 23 further requires that such financial assistance shall not be
 25 24 distributed to owners or investors of the company to which the
 25 25 business development services are being provided and shall not
 25 26 be provided to other persons assisting with the provision of
 25 27 the services.
 25 28    Under current law, an entrepreneurial assistance provider is
 25 29 required to accept client referrals from the EDA as a condition
 25 30 of receiving a grant.  The division provides that the EDA may
 25 31 make client referrals to eligible providers.
 25 32    DIVISION IV ==== MISCELLANEOUS CHANGES.  Division IV makes
 25 33 several miscellaneous changes to other EDA programs.  The
 25 34 division amends the sales and use tax refund available under
 25 35 the workforce housing tax incentive program.  That refund
 26  1 is available for sales and use tax paid prior to project
 26  2 completion, which is currently defined to mean the first date
 26  3 upon which the average annualized production of finished
 26  4 product for the preceding 90=day period at the manufacturing
 26  5 facility operated by the eligible business is at least 50
 26  6 percent of the initial design capacity of the facility.  The
 26  7 division amends the definition of "project completion" to mean
 26  8 the date on which the EDA notifies the department of revenue
 26  9 that all applicable requirements of a workforce housing tax
 26 10 incentive program agreement are satisfied.  This provision
 26 11 takes effect upon enactment and applies retroactively to July
 26 12 1, 2014, for all workforce housing tax incentive agreements
 26 13 entered into on or after that date.
 26 14    The division allows the EDA to extend the project
 26 15 completion date for a project awarded tax incentives under the
 26 16 redevelopment tax credit program and the housing enterprise
 26 17 zone tax incentives program if the property that is the subject
 26 18 of the project suffered a catastrophic fire during the 2014
 26 19 calendar year.

       mm/sc
 22  4 division makes the tax credit refundable for an investment
 22  5 made by a natural person, and for any other person reduces the
 22  6 carryforward period to three years.
 22  7    The division strikes a provision permitting the EDA
 22  8 to cooperate with small business development centers to
 22  9 disseminate information regarding the credits and to develop
 22 10 standard application forms, and requiring the EDA to distribute
 22 11 copies of the application forms to all community=based seed
 22 12 capital funds and potential individual investors.
 22 13    The division modifies the eligibility requirements for
 22 14 qualifying businesses.  The division strikes the requirement
 22 15 that a business have an owner that meets at least one of
 22 16 four qualifications relating to business education or
 22 17 business experience.  The division requires that a business
 22 18 be participating in an entrepreneurial assistance program,
 22 19 as defined in the division, but allows the EDA to waive this
 22 20 requirement if the business establishes that its owners,
 22 21 directors, officers, and employees have an appropriate level
 22 22 of experience such that an entrepreneurial assistance program
 22 23 would not materially change the prospects of the business.
 22 24 The EDA is allowed to consult with outside service providers
 22 25 in considering such a waiver.  The division increases from $5
 22 26 million to $10 million the maximum amount of net worth that
 22 27 a business may have to be considered a qualifying business.
 22 28 The division increases from $250,000 to $500,000 the amount of
 22 29 financing that a business must have in order to be considered a
 22 30 qualifying business, removes "near equity" from the types of
 22 31 financing that will be considered in that calculation, requires
 22 32 that the financing be secured at the time of application for
 22 33 the tax credits, and requires that the business have at least
 22 34 two investors at the time of application for the tax credits.
 22 35 These modified eligibility requirements apply to businesses
 23  1 that submit an application to the EDA to be registered as a
 23  2 qualifying business on or after the effective date of this
 23  3 division of the bill, and businesses that submitted such an
 23  4 application to the EDA before the effective date of this
 23  5 division of the bill shall be governed by current law.
 23  6    The division provides for the confidentiality of certain
 23  7 information with regard to the tax credit.  The identity of
 23  8 a qualifying business, the identity of an investor and the
 23  9 qualifying business in which the investor made an equity
 23 10 investment, and the total number and amount of tax credits
 23 11 issued shall be considered public information under Code
 23 12 chapter 22 (examination of public records), but any other
 23 13 information or record in the possession of the EDA with respect
 23 14 to the program shall be presumed by the EDA to be a trade secret
 23 15 protected under Code chapter 550 or common law and shall be
 23 16 kept confidential by the EDA unless otherwise ordered by a
 23 17 court.
 23 18    The division takes effect upon enactment and applies to
 23 19 equity investments in a qualifying business made on or after
 23 20 that date.  Equity investments in a qualifying business or
 23 21 community=based seed capital fund made prior to the effective
 23 22 date of the division shall be governed by current law.

 22 23 would not materially change the prospects of the business.
 22 24 The EDA is allowed to consult with outside service providers
 22 25 in considering such a waiver.  The division increases from $5
 22 26 million to $10 million the maximum amount of net worth that
 22 27 a business may have to be considered a qualifying business.
 22 28 The division increases from $250,000 to $500,000 the amount of
 22 29 financing that a business must have in order to be considered a
 22 30 qualifying business, removes "near equity" from the types of
 22 31 financing that will be considered in that calculation, requires
 22 32 that the financing be secured at the time of application for
 22 33 the tax credits, and requires that the business have at least
 22 34 two investors at the time of application for the tax credits.
 22 35 These modified eligibility requirements apply to businesses
 23  1 that submit an application to the EDA to be registered as a
 23  2 qualifying business on or after the effective date of this
 23  3 division of the bill, and businesses that submitted such an
 23  4 application to the EDA before the effective date of this
 23  5 division of the bill shall be governed by current law.
 23  6    The division provides for the confidentiality of certain
 23  7 information with regard to the tax credit.  The identity of
 23  8 a qualifying business, the identity of an investor and the
 23  9 qualifying business in which the investor made an equity
 23 10 investment, and the total number and amount of tax credits
 23 11 issued shall be considered public information under Code
 23 12 chapter 22 (examination of public records), but any other
 23 13 information or record in the possession of the EDA with respect
 23 14 to the program shall be presumed by the EDA to be a trade secret
 23 15 protected under Code chapter 550 or common law and shall be
 23 16 kept confidential by the EDA unless otherwise ordered by a
 23 17 court.
 23 18    The division takes effect upon enactment and applies to
 23 19 equity investments in a qualifying business made on or after
 23 20 that date.  Equity investments in a qualifying business or
 23 21 community=based seed capital fund made prior to the effective
 23 22 date of the division shall be governed by current law.
 23 23    DIVISION III ==== ENTREPRENEUR INVESTMENT AWARDS PROGRAM.
 23 24  Division III amends the entrepreneur investment awards program
 23 25 administered by the EDA.  The division strikes provisions that
 23 26 prohibited the EDA from making awards under the program since
 23 27 July 1, 2014, and that required the EDA by December 31, 2014,
 23 28 to conduct a comprehensive review of the program and submit
 23 29 a report with specified information to the governor and the
 23 30 general assembly.
 23 31    The division modifies the purpose of the program to be
 23 32 to provide financial assistance to eligible entrepreneurial
 23 33 assistance providers (provider) that provide technical and
 23 34 financial assistance to entrepreneurs and start=up companies
 23 35 seeking to create, locate, or expand a business in Iowa.
 24  1 "Financial assistance" is defined in the division.
 24  2    The division changes the requirements for receiving an
 24  3 award.  To be eligible to receive an award under current
 24  4 law, an entrepreneurial assistance program must have been
 24  5 an Iowa=based business, expended at least $500,000 during
 24  6 the previous fiscal year to provide technical and financial
 24  7 assistance services that meet the broad=based needs of
 24  8 entrepreneurs seeking to create, locate, or expand a business
 24  9 in Iowa that intends to derive more than 10 percent of its
 24 10 gross sales from markets outside Iowa; and must have engaged
 24 11 and communicated with certain other programs, funding sources,
 24 12 and entities for its entrepreneur clients.  The division
 24 13 amends the eligibility for receiving financial assistance to
 24 14 require that a provider have its principal place of operations
 24 15 in Iowa and that the provider offer a comprehensive set of
 24 16 business development services to emerging and early=stage
 24 17 innovation companies to assist in the creation, location,
 24 18 growth, and long=term success of the company in Iowa.
 24 19 "Business development services" is defined in the division.
 24 20 Business development services may be performed at the physical
 24 21 location of the provider or the company and may be provided in
 24 22 consideration of equity participation in the company, a fee for
 24 23 services, or a membership agreement with the company.
 24 24    Under current law, the EDA board could approve, deny, or
 24 25 defer each application for a grant, and was required to award
 24 26 grants on a first=come, first=served basis.  The division
 24 27 specifies that the EDA board has the discretion to approve,
 24 28 deny, or defer each application for financial assistance and
 24 29 that the amount of financial assistance awarded to a provider
 24 30 is within the discretion of the EDA.  The division requires
 24 31 the EDA to award financial assistance on a competitive basis
 24 32 and allows the EDA to develop scoring criteria and establish
 24 33 minimum requirements for the receipt of a financial assistance
 24 34 award.
 24 35    In addition to the four factors relating to the provider's
 25  1 professional staff that the EDA may consider under current
 25  2 law in deciding whether to award financial assistance, the
 25  3 division provides that the EDA may also consider the service
 25  4 model and likelihood of success of the provider, the provider's
 25  5 similarity to other successful providers in the country, and
 25  6 the provider's financial need.
 25  7    The division modifies the maximum award amount for a
 25  8 recipient.  Under current law, a grant to an entrepreneur
 25  9 assistance program cannot exceed the lesser of 25 percent of
 25 10 the funds expended by the program during the previous fiscal
 25 11 year, 100 percent of the funds raised from certain persons
 25 12 by the program during the previous fiscal year, or $200,000.
 25 13 The division provides that the amount of financial assistance
 25 14 awarded to any one provider shall not exceed $200,000.
 25 15    The division modifies the permitted use of funds received
 25 16 under the program.  Under current law, grants are only
 25 17 permitted to be used for the purpose of operating costs
 25 18 incurred by the program.  The division specifies that financial
 25 19 assistance awarded to a provider shall only be used for
 25 20 the purpose of operating costs incurred by the provider in
 25 21 the provision of business development services to emerging
 25 22 and early=stage innovation companies in Iowa.  The division
 25 23 further requires that such financial assistance shall not be
 25 24 distributed to owners or investors of the company to which the
 25 25 business development services are being provided and shall not
 25 26 be provided to other persons assisting with the provision of
 25 27 the services.
 25 28    Under current law, an entrepreneurial assistance provider is
 25 29 required to accept client referrals from the EDA as a condition
 25 30 of receiving a grant.  The division provides that the EDA may
 25 31 make client referrals to eligible providers.
 25 32    DIVISION IV ==== MISCELLANEOUS CHANGES.  Division IV makes
 25 33 several miscellaneous changes to other EDA programs.  The
 25 34 division amends the sales and use tax refund available under
 25 35 the workforce housing tax incentive program.  That refund
 26  1 is available for sales and use tax paid prior to project
 26  2 completion, which is currently defined to mean the first date
 26  3 upon which the average annualized production of finished
 26  4 product for the preceding 90=day period at the manufacturing
 26  5 facility operated by the eligible business is at least 50
 26  6 percent of the initial design capacity of the facility.  The
 26  7 division amends the definition of "project completion" to mean
 26  8 the date on which the EDA notifies the department of revenue
 26  9 that all applicable requirements of a workforce housing tax
 26 10 incentive program agreement are satisfied.  This provision
 26 11 takes effect upon enactment and applies retroactively to July
 26 12 1, 2014, for all workforce housing tax incentive agreements
 26 13 entered into on or after that date.
 26 14    The division allows the EDA to extend the project
 26 15 completion date for a project awarded tax incentives under the
 26 16 redevelopment tax credit program and the housing enterprise
 26 17 zone tax incentives program if the property that is the subject
 26 18 of the project suffered a catastrophic fire during the 2014
 26 19 calendar year.
       LSB 1212HV (3) 86
       mm/sc
 22  7    The division strikes a provision permitting the EDA
 22  8 to cooperate with small business development centers to
 22  9 disseminate information regarding the credits and to develop
 22 10 standard application forms, and requiring the EDA to distribute
 22 11 copies of the application forms to all community=based seed
 22 12 capital funds and potential individual investors.
 22 13    The division modifies the eligibility requirements for
 22 14 qualifying businesses.  The division strikes the requirement
 22 15 that a business have an owner that meets at least one of
 22 16 four qualifications relating to business education or
 22 17 business experience.  The division requires that a business
 22 18 be participating in an entrepreneurial assistance program,
 22 19 as defined in the division, but allows the EDA to waive this
 22 20 requirement if the business establishes that its owners,
 22 21 directors, officers, and employees have an appropriate level
 22 22 of experience such that an entrepreneurial assistance program
 22 23 would not materially change the prospects of the business.
 22 24 The EDA is allowed to consult with outside service providers
 22 25 in considering such a waiver.  The division increases from $5
 22 26 million to $10 million the maximum amount of net worth that
 22 27 a business may have to be considered a qualifying business.
 22 28 The division increases from $250,000 to $500,000 the amount of
 22 29 financing that a business must have in order to be considered a
 22 30 qualifying business, removes "near equity" from the types of
 22 31 financing that will be considered in that calculation, requires
 22 32 that the financing be secured at the time of application for
 22 33 the tax credits, and requires that the business have at least
 22 34 two investors at the time of application for the tax credits.
 22 35 These modified eligibility requirements apply to businesses
 23  1 that submit an application to the EDA to be registered as a
 23  2 qualifying business on or after the effective date of this
 23  3 division of the bill, and businesses that submitted such an
 23  4 application to the EDA before the effective date of this
 23  5 division of the bill shall be governed by current law.
 23  6    The division provides for the confidentiality of certain
 23  7 information with regard to the tax credit.  The identity of
 23  8 a qualifying business, the identity of an investor and the
 23  9 qualifying business in which the investor made an equity
 23 10 investment, and the total number and amount of tax credits
 23 11 issued shall be considered public information under Code
 23 12 chapter 22 (examination of public records), but any other
 23 13 information or record in the possession of the EDA with respect
 23 14 to the program shall be presumed by the EDA to be a trade secret
 23 15 protected under Code chapter 550 or common law and shall be
 23 16 kept confidential by the EDA unless otherwise ordered by a
 23 17 court.
 23 18    The division takes effect upon enactment and applies to
 23 19 equity investments in a qualifying business made on or after
 23 20 that date.  Equity investments in a qualifying business or
 23 21 community=based seed capital fund made prior to the effective
 23 22 date of the division shall be governed by current law.
 23 23    DIVISION III ==== ENTREPRENEUR INVESTMENT AWARDS PROGRAM.
 23 24  Division III amends the entrepreneur investment awards program
 23 25 administered by the EDA.  The division strikes provisions that

 25 13 The division provides that the amount of financial assistance
 25 14 awarded to any one provider shall not exceed $200,000.
 25 15    The division modifies the permitted use of funds received

 26  7 division amends the definition of "project completion" to mean
 26  8 the date on which the EDA notifies the department of revenue
 26  9 that all applicable requirements of a workforce housing tax
 26 10 incentive program agreement are satisfied.  This provision
 26 11 takes effect upon enactment and applies retroactively to July
 26 12 1, 2014, for all workforce housing tax incentive agreements
 26 13 entered into on or after that date.
 26 14    The division allows the EDA to extend the project
 26 15 completion date for a project awarded tax incentives under the
 26 16 redevelopment tax credit program and the housing enterprise
 26 17 zone tax incentives program if the property that is the subject
 26 18 of the project suffered a catastrophic fire during the 2014
 26 19 calendar year.

 22 10 standard application forms, and requiring the EDA to distribute
 22 11 copies of the application forms to all community=based seed
 22 12 capital funds and potential individual investors.
 22 13    The division modifies the eligibility requirements for
 22 14 qualifying businesses.  The division strikes the requirement
 22 15 that a business have an owner that meets at least one of
 22 16 four qualifications relating to business education or
 22 17 business experience.  The division requires that a business
 22 18 be participating in an entrepreneurial assistance program,
 22 19 as defined in the division, but allows the EDA to waive this
 22 20 requirement if the business establishes that its owners,
 22 21 directors, officers, and employees have an appropriate level
 22 22 of experience such that an entrepreneurial assistance program
 22 23 would not materially change the prospects of the business.
 22 24 The EDA is allowed to consult with outside service providers
 22 25 in considering such a waiver.  The division increases from $5
 22 26 million to $10 million the maximum amount of net worth that
 22 27 a business may have to be considered a qualifying business.
 22 28 The division increases from $250,000 to $500,000 the amount of
 22 29 financing that a business must have in order to be considered a
 22 30 qualifying business, removes "near equity" from the types of
 22 31 financing that will be considered in that calculation, requires
 22 32 that the financing be secured at the time of application for
 22 33 the tax credits, and requires that the business have at least
 22 34 two investors at the time of application for the tax credits.
 22 35 These modified eligibility requirements apply to businesses
 23  1 that submit an application to the EDA to be registered as a
 23  2 qualifying business on or after the effective date of this
 23  3 division of the bill, and businesses that submitted such an
 23  4 application to the EDA before the effective date of this
 23  5 division of the bill shall be governed by current law.
 23  6    The division provides for the confidentiality of certain
 23  7 information with regard to the tax credit.  The identity of
 23  8 a qualifying business, the identity of an investor and the
 23  9 qualifying business in which the investor made an equity
 23 10 investment, and the total number and amount of tax credits
 23 11 issued shall be considered public information under Code
 23 12 chapter 22 (examination of public records), but any other
 23 13 information or record in the possession of the EDA with respect
 23 14 to the program shall be presumed by the EDA to be a trade secret
 23 15 protected under Code chapter 550 or common law and shall be
 23 16 kept confidential by the EDA unless otherwise ordered by a
 23 17 court.
 23 18    The division takes effect upon enactment and applies to
 23 19 equity investments in a qualifying business made on or after
 23 20 that date.  Equity investments in a qualifying business or
 23 21 community=based seed capital fund made prior to the effective
 23 22 date of the division shall be governed by current law.
 23 23    DIVISION III ==== ENTREPRENEUR INVESTMENT AWARDS PROGRAM.
 23 24  Division III amends the entrepreneur investment awards program
 23 25 administered by the EDA.  The division strikes provisions that
 23 26 prohibited the EDA from making awards under the program since
 23 27 July 1, 2014, and that required the EDA by December 31, 2014,
 23 28 to conduct a comprehensive review of the program and submit
 23 29 a report with specified information to the governor and the
 23 30 general assembly.
 23 31    The division modifies the purpose of the program to be
 23 32 to provide financial assistance to eligible entrepreneurial
 23 33 assistance providers (provider) that provide technical and
 23 34 financial assistance to entrepreneurs and start=up companies
 23 35 seeking to create, locate, or expand a business in Iowa.
 24  1 "Financial assistance" is defined in the division.
 24  2    The division changes the requirements for receiving an
 24  3 award.  To be eligible to receive an award under current
 24  4 law, an entrepreneurial assistance program must have been
 24  5 an Iowa=based business, expended at least $500,000 during
 24  6 the previous fiscal year to provide technical and financial
 24  7 assistance services that meet the broad=based needs of
 24  8 entrepreneurs seeking to create, locate, or expand a business
 24  9 in Iowa that intends to derive more than 10 percent of its
 24 10 gross sales from markets outside Iowa; and must have engaged
 24 11 and communicated with certain other programs, funding sources,
 24 12 and entities for its entrepreneur clients.  The division
 24 13 amends the eligibility for receiving financial assistance to
 24 14 require that a provider have its principal place of operations
 24 15 in Iowa and that the provider offer a comprehensive set of
 24 16 business development services to emerging and early=stage
 24 17 innovation companies to assist in the creation, location,
 24 18 growth, and long=term success of the company in Iowa.
 24 19 "Business development services" is defined in the division.
 24 20 Business development services may be performed at the physical
 24 21 location of the provider or the company and may be provided in
 24 22 consideration of equity participation in the company, a fee for
 24 23 services, or a membership agreement with the company.
 24 24    Under current law, the EDA board could approve, deny, or
 24 25 defer each application for a grant, and was required to award
 24 26 grants on a first=come, first=served basis.  The division
 24 27 specifies that the EDA board has the discretion to approve,
 24 28 deny, or defer each application for financial assistance and
 24 29 that the amount of financial assistance awarded to a provider
 24 30 is within the discretion of the EDA.  The division requires
 24 31 the EDA to award financial assistance on a competitive basis
 24 32 and allows the EDA to develop scoring criteria and establish
 24 33 minimum requirements for the receipt of a financial assistance
 24 34 award.
 24 35    In addition to the four factors relating to the provider's
 25  1 professional staff that the EDA may consider under current
 25  2 law in deciding whether to award financial assistance, the
 25  3 division provides that the EDA may also consider the service
 25  4 model and likelihood of success of the provider, the provider's
 25  5 similarity to other successful providers in the country, and
 25  6 the provider's financial need.
 25  7    The division modifies the maximum award amount for a
 25  8 recipient.  Under current law, a grant to an entrepreneur
 25  9 assistance program cannot exceed the lesser of 25 percent of
 25 10 the funds expended by the program during the previous fiscal
 25 11 year, 100 percent of the funds raised from certain persons
 25 12 by the program during the previous fiscal year, or $200,000.
 25 13 The division provides that the amount of financial assistance
 25 14 awarded to any one provider shall not exceed $200,000.
 25 15    The division modifies the permitted use of funds received
 25 16 under the program.  Under current law, grants are only
 25 17 permitted to be used for the purpose of operating costs
 25 18 incurred by the program.  The division specifies that financial
 25 19 assistance awarded to a provider shall only be used for
 25 20 the purpose of operating costs incurred by the provider in
 25 21 the provision of business development services to emerging
 25 22 and early=stage innovation companies in Iowa.  The division
 25 23 further requires that such financial assistance shall not be
 25 24 distributed to owners or investors of the company to which the
 25 25 business development services are being provided and shall not
 25 26 be provided to other persons assisting with the provision of
 25 27 the services.
 25 28    Under current law, an entrepreneurial assistance provider is
 25 29 required to accept client referrals from the EDA as a condition
 25 30 of receiving a grant.  The division provides that the EDA may
 25 31 make client referrals to eligible providers.
 25 32    DIVISION IV ==== MISCELLANEOUS CHANGES.  Division IV makes
 25 33 several miscellaneous changes to other EDA programs.  The
 25 34 division amends the sales and use tax refund available under
 25 35 the workforce housing tax incentive program.  That refund
 26  1 is available for sales and use tax paid prior to project
 26  2 completion, which is currently defined to mean the first date
 26  3 upon which the average annualized production of finished
 26  4 product for the preceding 90=day period at the manufacturing
 26  5 facility operated by the eligible business is at least 50
 26  6 percent of the initial design capacity of the facility.  The
 26  7 division amends the definition of "project completion" to mean
 26  8 the date on which the EDA notifies the department of revenue
 26  9 that all applicable requirements of a workforce housing tax
 26 10 incentive program agreement are satisfied.  This provision
 26 11 takes effect upon enactment and applies retroactively to July
 26 12 1, 2014, for all workforce housing tax incentive agreements
 26 13 entered into on or after that date.
 26 14    The division allows the EDA to extend the project
 26 15 completion date for a project awarded tax incentives under the
 26 16 redevelopment tax credit program and the housing enterprise
 26 17 zone tax incentives program if the property that is the subject

 22 23 would not materially change the prospects of the business.
 22 24 The EDA is allowed to consult with outside service providers
 22 25 in considering such a waiver.  The division increases from $5
 22 26 million to $10 million the maximum amount of net worth that
 22 27 a business may have to be considered a qualifying business.
 22 28 The division increases from $250,000 to $500,000 the amount of
 22 29 financing that a business must have in order to be considered a

 22 34 two investors at the time of application for the tax credits.
 22 35 These modified eligibility requirements apply to businesses
 23  1 that submit an application to the EDA to be registered as a
 23  2 qualifying business on or after the effective date of this
 23  3 division of the bill, and businesses that submitted such an
 23  4 application to the EDA before the effective date of this
 23  5 division of the bill shall be governed by current law.
 23  6    The division provides for the confidentiality of certain
 23  7 information with regard to the tax credit.  The identity of

 23 10 investment, and the total number and amount of tax credits
 23 11 issued shall be considered public information under Code
 23 12 chapter 22 (examination of public records), but any other

 23 17 court.
 23 18    The division takes effect upon enactment and applies to
 23 19 equity investments in a qualifying business made on or after

 25 19 assistance awarded to a provider shall only be used for
 25 20 the purpose of operating costs incurred by the provider in
 25 21 the provision of business development services to emerging
 25 22 and early=stage innovation companies in Iowa.  The division
 25 23 further requires that such financial assistance shall not be
 25 24 distributed to owners or investors of the company to which the
 25 25 business development services are being provided and shall not
 25 26 be provided to other persons assisting with the provision of
 25 27 the services.
 25 28    Under current law, an entrepreneurial assistance provider is
 25 29 required to accept client referrals from the EDA as a condition
 25 30 of receiving a grant.  The division provides that the EDA may
 25 31 make client referrals to eligible providers.
 25 32    DIVISION IV ==== MISCELLANEOUS CHANGES.  Division IV makes
 25 33 several miscellaneous changes to other EDA programs.  The
 25 34 division amends the sales and use tax refund available under
 25 35 the workforce housing tax incentive program.  That refund
 26  1 is available for sales and use tax paid prior to project
 26  2 completion, which is currently defined to mean the first date
 26  3 upon which the average annualized production of finished
 26  4 product for the preceding 90=day period at the manufacturing
 26  5 facility operated by the eligible business is at least 50
 26  6 percent of the initial design capacity of the facility.  The
 26  7 division amends the definition of "project completion" to mean
 26  8 the date on which the EDA notifies the department of revenue
 26  9 that all applicable requirements of a workforce housing tax
 26 10 incentive program agreement are satisfied.  This provision
 26 11 takes effect upon enactment and applies retroactively to July
 26 12 1, 2014, for all workforce housing tax incentive agreements
 26 13 entered into on or after that date.
 26 14    The division allows the EDA to extend the project
 26 15 completion date for a project awarded tax incentives under the
 26 16 redevelopment tax credit program and the housing enterprise
 26 17 zone tax incentives program if the property that is the subject
 26 18 of the project suffered a catastrophic fire during the 2014
 26 19 calendar year.

       mm/sc
 22 12 capital funds and potential individual investors.
 22 13    The division modifies the eligibility requirements for
 22 14 qualifying businesses.  The division strikes the requirement
 22 15 that a business have an owner that meets at least one of
 22 16 four qualifications relating to business education or
 22 17 business experience.  The division requires that a business
 22 18 be participating in an entrepreneurial assistance program,
 22 19 as defined in the division, but allows the EDA to waive this
 22 20 requirement if the business establishes that its owners,
 22 21 directors, officers, and employees have an appropriate level
 22 22 of experience such that an entrepreneurial assistance program
 22 23 would not materially change the prospects of the business.
 22 24 The EDA is allowed to consult with outside service providers
 22 25 in considering such a waiver.  The division increases from $5
 22 26 million to $10 million the maximum amount of net worth that
 22 27 a business may have to be considered a qualifying business.
 22 28 The division increases from $250,000 to $500,000 the amount of
 22 29 financing that a business must have in order to be considered a
 22 30 qualifying business, removes "near equity" from the types of
 22 31 financing that will be considered in that calculation, requires
 22 32 that the financing be secured at the time of application for
 22 33 the tax credits, and requires that the business have at least
 22 34 two investors at the time of application for the tax credits.
 22 35 These modified eligibility requirements apply to businesses
 23  1 that submit an application to the EDA to be registered as a
 23  2 qualifying business on or after the effective date of this
 23  3 division of the bill, and businesses that submitted such an
 23  4 application to the EDA before the effective date of this
 23  5 division of the bill shall be governed by current law.
 23  6    The division provides for the confidentiality of certain
 23  7 information with regard to the tax credit.  The identity of
 23  8 a qualifying business, the identity of an investor and the
 23  9 qualifying business in which the investor made an equity
 23 10 investment, and the total number and amount of tax credits
 23 11 issued shall be considered public information under Code
 23 12 chapter 22 (examination of public records), but any other
 23 13 information or record in the possession of the EDA with respect
 23 14 to the program shall be presumed by the EDA to be a trade secret
 23 15 protected under Code chapter 550 or common law and shall be
 23 16 kept confidential by the EDA unless otherwise ordered by a
 23 17 court.
 23 18    The division takes effect upon enactment and applies to
 23 19 equity investments in a qualifying business made on or after
 23 20 that date.  Equity investments in a qualifying business or
 23 21 community=based seed capital fund made prior to the effective
 23 22 date of the division shall be governed by current law.
 23 23    DIVISION III ==== ENTREPRENEUR INVESTMENT AWARDS PROGRAM.
 23 24  Division III amends the entrepreneur investment awards program
 23 25 administered by the EDA.  The division strikes provisions that
 23 26 prohibited the EDA from making awards under the program since
 23 27 July 1, 2014, and that required the EDA by December 31, 2014,
 23 28 to conduct a comprehensive review of the program and submit
 23 29 a report with specified information to the governor and the
 23 30 general assembly.
 23 31    The division modifies the purpose of the program to be
 23 32 to provide financial assistance to eligible entrepreneurial
 23 33 assistance providers (provider) that provide technical and
 23 34 financial assistance to entrepreneurs and start=up companies
 23 35 seeking to create, locate, or expand a business in Iowa.
 24  1 "Financial assistance" is defined in the division.
 24  2    The division changes the requirements for receiving an
 24  3 award.  To be eligible to receive an award under current
 24  4 law, an entrepreneurial assistance program must have been
 24  5 an Iowa=based business, expended at least $500,000 during
 24  6 the previous fiscal year to provide technical and financial
 24  7 assistance services that meet the broad=based needs of
 24  8 entrepreneurs seeking to create, locate, or expand a business
 24  9 in Iowa that intends to derive more than 10 percent of its
 24 10 gross sales from markets outside Iowa; and must have engaged
 24 11 and communicated with certain other programs, funding sources,
 24 12 and entities for its entrepreneur clients.  The division
 24 13 amends the eligibility for receiving financial assistance to
 24 14 require that a provider have its principal place of operations
 24 15 in Iowa and that the provider offer a comprehensive set of
 24 16 business development services to emerging and early=stage
 24 17 innovation companies to assist in the creation, location,
 24 18 growth, and long=term success of the company in Iowa.
 24 19 "Business development services" is defined in the division.
 24 20 Business development services may be performed at the physical
 24 21 location of the provider or the company and may be provided in
 24 22 consideration of equity participation in the company, a fee for
 24 23 services, or a membership agreement with the company.
 24 24    Under current law, the EDA board could approve, deny, or
 24 25 defer each application for a grant, and was required to award
 24 26 grants on a first=come, first=served basis.  The division
 24 27 specifies that the EDA board has the discretion to approve,
 24 28 deny, or defer each application for financial assistance and
 24 29 that the amount of financial assistance awarded to a provider
 24 30 is within the discretion of the EDA.  The division requires
 24 31 the EDA to award financial assistance on a competitive basis
 24 32 and allows the EDA to develop scoring criteria and establish
 24 33 minimum requirements for the receipt of a financial assistance
 24 34 award.
 24 35    In addition to the four factors relating to the provider's
 25  1 professional staff that the EDA may consider under current
 25  2 law in deciding whether to award financial assistance, the
 25  3 division provides that the EDA may also consider the service
 25  4 model and likelihood of success of the provider, the provider's
 25  5 similarity to other successful providers in the country, and
 25  6 the provider's financial need.
 25  7    The division modifies the maximum award amount for a
 25  8 recipient.  Under current law, a grant to an entrepreneur
 25  9 assistance program cannot exceed the lesser of 25 percent of
 25 10 the funds expended by the program during the previous fiscal
 25 11 year, 100 percent of the funds raised from certain persons
 25 12 by the program during the previous fiscal year, or $200,000.
 25 13 The division provides that the amount of financial assistance
 25 14 awarded to any one provider shall not exceed $200,000.
 25 15    The division modifies the permitted use of funds received
 25 16 under the program.  Under current law, grants are only
 25 17 permitted to be used for the purpose of operating costs
 25 18 incurred by the program.  The division specifies that financial
 25 19 assistance awarded to a provider shall only be used for
 25 20 the purpose of operating costs incurred by the provider in
 25 21 the provision of business development services to emerging
 25 22 and early=stage innovation companies in Iowa.  The division
 25 23 further requires that such financial assistance shall not be
 25 24 distributed to owners or investors of the company to which the
 25 25 business development services are being provided and shall not
 25 26 be provided to other persons assisting with the provision of
 25 27 the services.
 25 28    Under current law, an entrepreneurial assistance provider is
 25 29 required to accept client referrals from the EDA as a condition
 25 30 of receiving a grant.  The division provides that the EDA may
 25 31 make client referrals to eligible providers.
 25 32    DIVISION IV ==== MISCELLANEOUS CHANGES.  Division IV makes

 26  9 that all applicable requirements of a workforce housing tax
 26 10 incentive program agreement are satisfied.  This provision
 26 11 takes effect upon enactment and applies retroactively to July

 25  7    The division modifies the maximum award amount for a
 25  8 recipient.  Under current law, a grant to an entrepreneur
 25  9 assistance program cannot exceed the lesser of 25 percent of
 25 10 the funds expended by the program during the previous fiscal
 25 11 year, 100 percent of the funds raised from certain persons
 25 12 by the program during the previous fiscal year, or $200,000.
 25 13 The division provides that the amount of financial assistance
 25 14 awarded to any one provider shall not exceed $200,000.
 25 15    The division modifies the permitted use of funds received
 25 16 under the program.  Under current law, grants are only
 25 17 permitted to be used for the purpose of operating costs
 25 18 incurred by the program.  The division specifies that financial
 25 19 assistance awarded to a provider shall only be used for
 25 20 the purpose of operating costs incurred by the provider in
 25 21 the provision of business development services to emerging
 25 22 and early=stage innovation companies in Iowa.  The division
 25 23 further requires that such financial assistance shall not be
 25 24 distributed to owners or investors of the company to which the
 25 25 business development services are being provided and shall not
 25 26 be provided to other persons assisting with the provision of
 25 27 the services.
 25 28    Under current law, an entrepreneurial assistance provider is
 25 29 required to accept client referrals from the EDA as a condition
 25 30 of receiving a grant.  The division provides that the EDA may
 25 31 make client referrals to eligible providers.
 25 32    DIVISION IV ==== MISCELLANEOUS CHANGES.  Division IV makes
 25 33 several miscellaneous changes to other EDA programs.  The
 25 34 division amends the sales and use tax refund available under
 25 35 the workforce housing tax incentive program.  That refund
 26  1 is available for sales and use tax paid prior to project
 26  2 completion, which is currently defined to mean the first date
 26  3 upon which the average annualized production of finished
 26  4 product for the preceding 90=day period at the manufacturing
 26  5 facility operated by the eligible business is at least 50
 26  6 percent of the initial design capacity of the facility.  The
 26  7 division amends the definition of "project completion" to mean
 26  8 the date on which the EDA notifies the department of revenue
 26  9 that all applicable requirements of a workforce housing tax
 26 10 incentive program agreement are satisfied.  This provision
 26 11 takes effect upon enactment and applies retroactively to July
 26 12 1, 2014, for all workforce housing tax incentive agreements
 26 13 entered into on or after that date.
 26 14    The division allows the EDA to extend the project
 26 15 completion date for a project awarded tax incentives under the
 26 16 redevelopment tax credit program and the housing enterprise
 26 17 zone tax incentives program if the property that is the subject
 26 18 of the project suffered a catastrophic fire during the 2014
 26 19 calendar year.

       mm/sc
 22 15 that a business have an owner that meets at least one of
 22 16 four qualifications relating to business education or
 22 17 business experience.  The division requires that a business
 22 18 be participating in an entrepreneurial assistance program,
 22 19 as defined in the division, but allows the EDA to waive this
 22 20 requirement if the business establishes that its owners,
 22 21 directors, officers, and employees have an appropriate level
 22 22 of experience such that an entrepreneurial assistance program
 22 23 would not materially change the prospects of the business.
 22 24 The EDA is allowed to consult with outside service providers
 22 25 in considering such a waiver.  The division increases from $5
 22 26 million to $10 million the maximum amount of net worth that
 22 27 a business may have to be considered a qualifying business.
 22 28 The division increases from $250,000 to $500,000 the amount of
 22 29 financing that a business must have in order to be considered a
 22 30 qualifying business, removes "near equity" from the types of
 22 31 financing that will be considered in that calculation, requires
 22 32 that the financing be secured at the time of application for
 22 33 the tax credits, and requires that the business have at least
 22 34 two investors at the time of application for the tax credits.
 22 35 These modified eligibility requirements apply to businesses
 23  1 that submit an application to the EDA to be registered as a
 23  2 qualifying business on or after the effective date of this
 23  3 division of the bill, and businesses that submitted such an
 23  4 application to the EDA before the effective date of this
 23  5 division of the bill shall be governed by current law.
 23  6    The division provides for the confidentiality of certain
 23  7 information with regard to the tax credit.  The identity of
 23  8 a qualifying business, the identity of an investor and the
 23  9 qualifying business in which the investor made an equity
 23 10 investment, and the total number and amount of tax credits
 23 11 issued shall be considered public information under Code
 23 12 chapter 22 (examination of public records), but any other
 23 13 information or record in the possession of the EDA with respect
 23 14 to the program shall be presumed by the EDA to be a trade secret
 23 15 protected under Code chapter 550 or common law and shall be
 23 16 kept confidential by the EDA unless otherwise ordered by a
 23 17 court.
 23 18    The division takes effect upon enactment and applies to
 23 19 equity investments in a qualifying business made on or after
 23 20 that date.  Equity investments in a qualifying business or
 23 21 community=based seed capital fund made prior to the effective
 23 22 date of the division shall be governed by current law.
 23 23    DIVISION III ==== ENTREPRENEUR INVESTMENT AWARDS PROGRAM.
 23 24  Division III amends the entrepreneur investment awards program
 23 25 administered by the EDA.  The division strikes provisions that
 23 26 prohibited the EDA from making awards under the program since
 23 27 July 1, 2014, and that required the EDA by December 31, 2014,
 23 28 to conduct a comprehensive review of the program and submit
 23 29 a report with specified information to the governor and the
 23 30 general assembly.
 23 31    The division modifies the purpose of the program to be
 23 32 to provide financial assistance to eligible entrepreneurial
 23 33 assistance providers (provider) that provide technical and
 23 34 financial assistance to entrepreneurs and start=up companies
 23 35 seeking to create, locate, or expand a business in Iowa.
 24  1 "Financial assistance" is defined in the division.
 24  2    The division changes the requirements for receiving an
 24  3 award.  To be eligible to receive an award under current
 24  4 law, an entrepreneurial assistance program must have been
 24  5 an Iowa=based business, expended at least $500,000 during
 24  6 the previous fiscal year to provide technical and financial
 24  7 assistance services that meet the broad=based needs of
 24  8 entrepreneurs seeking to create, locate, or expand a business
 24  9 in Iowa that intends to derive more than 10 percent of its
 24 10 gross sales from markets outside Iowa; and must have engaged
 24 11 and communicated with certain other programs, funding sources,
 24 12 and entities for its entrepreneur clients.  The division
 24 13 amends the eligibility for receiving financial assistance to
 24 14 require that a provider have its principal place of operations
 24 15 in Iowa and that the provider offer a comprehensive set of
 24 16 business development services to emerging and early=stage
 24 17 innovation companies to assist in the creation, location,
 24 18 growth, and long=term success of the company in Iowa.
 24 19 "Business development services" is defined in the division.
 24 20 Business development services may be performed at the physical
 24 21 location of the provider or the company and may be provided in
 24 22 consideration of equity participation in the company, a fee for
 24 23 services, or a membership agreement with the company.
 24 24    Under current law, the EDA board could approve, deny, or
 24 25 defer each application for a grant, and was required to award
 24 26 grants on a first=come, first=served basis.  The division
 24 27 specifies that the EDA board has the discretion to approve,
 24 28 deny, or defer each application for financial assistance and
 24 29 that the amount of financial assistance awarded to a provider
 24 30 is within the discretion of the EDA.  The division requires
 24 31 the EDA to award financial assistance on a competitive basis
 24 32 and allows the EDA to develop scoring criteria and establish
 24 33 minimum requirements for the receipt of a financial assistance
 24 34 award.
 24 35    In addition to the four factors relating to the provider's
 25  1 professional staff that the EDA may consider under current
 25  2 law in deciding whether to award financial assistance, the
 25  3 division provides that the EDA may also consider the service
 25  4 model and likelihood of success of the provider, the provider's
 25  5 similarity to other successful providers in the country, and
 25  6 the provider's financial need.
 25  7    The division modifies the maximum award amount for a
 25  8 recipient.  Under current law, a grant to an entrepreneur
 25  9 assistance program cannot exceed the lesser of 25 percent of
 25 10 the funds expended by the program during the previous fiscal
 25 11 year, 100 percent of the funds raised from certain persons
 25 12 by the program during the previous fiscal year, or $200,000.
 25 13 The division provides that the amount of financial assistance
 25 14 awarded to any one provider shall not exceed $200,000.
 25 15    The division modifies the permitted use of funds received
 25 16 under the program.  Under current law, grants are only
 25 17 permitted to be used for the purpose of operating costs
 25 18 incurred by the program.  The division specifies that financial
 25 19 assistance awarded to a provider shall only be used for
 25 20 the purpose of operating costs incurred by the provider in
 25 21 the provision of business development services to emerging
 25 22 and early=stage innovation companies in Iowa.  The division
 25 23 further requires that such financial assistance shall not be
 25 24 distributed to owners or investors of the company to which the
 25 25 business development services are being provided and shall not
 25 26 be provided to other persons assisting with the provision of
 25 27 the services.
 25 28    Under current law, an entrepreneurial assistance provider is
 25 29 required to accept client referrals from the EDA as a condition
 25 30 of receiving a grant.  The division provides that the EDA may
 25 31 make client referrals to eligible providers.
 25 32    DIVISION IV ==== MISCELLANEOUS CHANGES.  Division IV makes
 25 33 several miscellaneous changes to other EDA programs.  The
 25 34 division amends the sales and use tax refund available under
 25 35 the workforce housing tax incentive program.  That refund

 26  5 facility operated by the eligible business is at least 50
 26  6 percent of the initial design capacity of the facility.  The
 26  7 division amends the definition of "project completion" to mean
 26  8 the date on which the EDA notifies the department of revenue
 26  9 that all applicable requirements of a workforce housing tax
 26 10 incentive program agreement are satisfied.  This provision
 26 11 takes effect upon enactment and applies retroactively to July
 26 12 1, 2014, for all workforce housing tax incentive agreements
 26 13 entered into on or after that date.
 26 14    The division allows the EDA to extend the project
 26 15 completion date for a project awarded tax incentives under the
 26 16 redevelopment tax credit program and the housing enterprise
 26 17 zone tax incentives program if the property that is the subject

 23  3 division of the bill, and businesses that submitted such an
 23  4 application to the EDA before the effective date of this
 23  5 division of the bill shall be governed by current law.
 23  6    The division provides for the confidentiality of certain
 23  7 information with regard to the tax credit.  The identity of
 23  8 a qualifying business, the identity of an investor and the

 23 10 investment, and the total number and amount of tax credits
 23 11 issued shall be considered public information under Code
 23 12 chapter 22 (examination of public records), but any other
 23 13 information or record in the possession of the EDA with respect

 23 23    DIVISION III ==== ENTREPRENEUR INVESTMENT AWARDS PROGRAM.
 23 24  Division III amends the entrepreneur investment awards program

 25  2 law in deciding whether to award financial assistance, the
 25  3 division provides that the EDA may also consider the service
 25  4 model and likelihood of success of the provider, the provider's
 25  5 similarity to other successful providers in the country, and
 25  6 the provider's financial need.
 25  7    The division modifies the maximum award amount for a
 25  8 recipient.  Under current law, a grant to an entrepreneur
 25  9 assistance program cannot exceed the lesser of 25 percent of
 25 10 the funds expended by the program during the previous fiscal
 25 11 year, 100 percent of the funds raised from certain persons
 25 12 by the program during the previous fiscal year, or $200,000.
 25 13 The division provides that the amount of financial assistance
 25 14 awarded to any one provider shall not exceed $200,000.
 25 15    The division modifies the permitted use of funds received
 25 16 under the program.  Under current law, grants are only
 25 17 permitted to be used for the purpose of operating costs
 25 18 incurred by the program.  The division specifies that financial
 25 19 assistance awarded to a provider shall only be used for
 25 20 the purpose of operating costs incurred by the provider in
 25 21 the provision of business development services to emerging
 25 22 and early=stage innovation companies in Iowa.  The division
 25 23 further requires that such financial assistance shall not be
 25 24 distributed to owners or investors of the company to which the
 25 25 business development services are being provided and shall not
 25 26 be provided to other persons assisting with the provision of
 25 27 the services.
 25 28    Under current law, an entrepreneurial assistance provider is
 25 29 required to accept client referrals from the EDA as a condition
 25 30 of receiving a grant.  The division provides that the EDA may
 25 31 make client referrals to eligible providers.
 25 32    DIVISION IV ==== MISCELLANEOUS CHANGES.  Division IV makes
 25 33 several miscellaneous changes to other EDA programs.  The
 25 34 division amends the sales and use tax refund available under
 25 35 the workforce housing tax incentive program.  That refund
 26  1 is available for sales and use tax paid prior to project
 26  2 completion, which is currently defined to mean the first date
 26  3 upon which the average annualized production of finished
 26  4 product for the preceding 90=day period at the manufacturing
 26  5 facility operated by the eligible business is at least 50
 26  6 percent of the initial design capacity of the facility.  The
 26  7 division amends the definition of "project completion" to mean
 26  8 the date on which the EDA notifies the department of revenue
 26  9 that all applicable requirements of a workforce housing tax
 26 10 incentive program agreement are satisfied.  This provision
 26 11 takes effect upon enactment and applies retroactively to July
 26 12 1, 2014, for all workforce housing tax incentive agreements
 26 13 entered into on or after that date.
 26 14    The division allows the EDA to extend the project
 26 15 completion date for a project awarded tax incentives under the
 26 16 redevelopment tax credit program and the housing enterprise
 26 17 zone tax incentives program if the property that is the subject
 26 18 of the project suffered a catastrophic fire during the 2014
 26 19 calendar year.

 22 18 be participating in an entrepreneurial assistance program,
 22 19 as defined in the division, but allows the EDA to waive this
 22 20 requirement if the business establishes that its owners,
 22 21 directors, officers, and employees have an appropriate level
 22 22 of experience such that an entrepreneurial assistance program
 22 23 would not materially change the prospects of the business.
 22 24 The EDA is allowed to consult with outside service providers
 22 25 in considering such a waiver.  The division increases from $5
 22 26 million to $10 million the maximum amount of net worth that
 22 27 a business may have to be considered a qualifying business.
 22 28 The division increases from $250,000 to $500,000 the amount of
 22 29 financing that a business must have in order to be considered a
 22 30 qualifying business, removes "near equity" from the types of
 22 31 financing that will be considered in that calculation, requires
 22 32 that the financing be secured at the time of application for
 22 33 the tax credits, and requires that the business have at least
 22 34 two investors at the time of application for the tax credits.
 22 35 These modified eligibility requirements apply to businesses
 23  1 that submit an application to the EDA to be registered as a
 23  2 qualifying business on or after the effective date of this
 23  3 division of the bill, and businesses that submitted such an
 23  4 application to the EDA before the effective date of this
 23  5 division of the bill shall be governed by current law.
 23  6    The division provides for the confidentiality of certain
 23  7 information with regard to the tax credit.  The identity of
 23  8 a qualifying business, the identity of an investor and the
 23  9 qualifying business in which the investor made an equity
 23 10 investment, and the total number and amount of tax credits
 23 11 issued shall be considered public information under Code
 23 12 chapter 22 (examination of public records), but any other
 23 13 information or record in the possession of the EDA with respect
 23 14 to the program shall be presumed by the EDA to be a trade secret
 23 15 protected under Code chapter 550 or common law and shall be
 23 16 kept confidential by the EDA unless otherwise ordered by a
 23 17 court.
 23 18    The division takes effect upon enactment and applies to
 23 19 equity investments in a qualifying business made on or after
 23 20 that date.  Equity investments in a qualifying business or
 23 21 community=based seed capital fund made prior to the effective
 23 22 date of the division shall be governed by current law.
 23 23    DIVISION III ==== ENTREPRENEUR INVESTMENT AWARDS PROGRAM.
 23 24  Division III amends the entrepreneur investment awards program
 23 25 administered by the EDA.  The division strikes provisions that
 23 26 prohibited the EDA from making awards under the program since
 23 27 July 1, 2014, and that required the EDA by December 31, 2014,
 23 28 to conduct a comprehensive review of the program and submit
 23 29 a report with specified information to the governor and the
 23 30 general assembly.
 23 31    The division modifies the purpose of the program to be
 23 32 to provide financial assistance to eligible entrepreneurial
 23 33 assistance providers (provider) that provide technical and
 23 34 financial assistance to entrepreneurs and start=up companies
 23 35 seeking to create, locate, or expand a business in Iowa.
 24  1 "Financial assistance" is defined in the division.
 24  2    The division changes the requirements for receiving an
 24  3 award.  To be eligible to receive an award under current
 24  4 law, an entrepreneurial assistance program must have been
 24  5 an Iowa=based business, expended at least $500,000 during
 24  6 the previous fiscal year to provide technical and financial
 24  7 assistance services that meet the broad=based needs of
 24  8 entrepreneurs seeking to create, locate, or expand a business
 24  9 in Iowa that intends to derive more than 10 percent of its
 24 10 gross sales from markets outside Iowa; and must have engaged
 24 11 and communicated with certain other programs, funding sources,
 24 12 and entities for its entrepreneur clients.  The division
 24 13 amends the eligibility for receiving financial assistance to
 24 14 require that a provider have its principal place of operations
 24 15 in Iowa and that the provider offer a comprehensive set of
 24 16 business development services to emerging and early=stage
 24 17 innovation companies to assist in the creation, location,
 24 18 growth, and long=term success of the company in Iowa.
 24 19 "Business development services" is defined in the division.
 24 20 Business development services may be performed at the physical
 24 21 location of the provider or the company and may be provided in
 24 22 consideration of equity participation in the company, a fee for
 24 23 services, or a membership agreement with the company.
 24 24    Under current law, the EDA board could approve, deny, or
 24 25 defer each application for a grant, and was required to award
 24 26 grants on a first=come, first=served basis.  The division
 24 27 specifies that the EDA board has the discretion to approve,
 24 28 deny, or defer each application for financial assistance and
 24 29 that the amount of financial assistance awarded to a provider
 24 30 is within the discretion of the EDA.  The division requires
 24 31 the EDA to award financial assistance on a competitive basis
 24 32 and allows the EDA to develop scoring criteria and establish
 24 33 minimum requirements for the receipt of a financial assistance
 24 34 award.
 24 35    In addition to the four factors relating to the provider's
 25  1 professional staff that the EDA may consider under current
 25  2 law in deciding whether to award financial assistance, the
 25  3 division provides that the EDA may also consider the service
 25  4 model and likelihood of success of the provider, the provider's
 25  5 similarity to other successful providers in the country, and
 25  6 the provider's financial need.
 25  7    The division modifies the maximum award amount for a
 25  8 recipient.  Under current law, a grant to an entrepreneur
 25  9 assistance program cannot exceed the lesser of 25 percent of
 25 10 the funds expended by the program during the previous fiscal
 25 11 year, 100 percent of the funds raised from certain persons
 25 12 by the program during the previous fiscal year, or $200,000.
 25 13 The division provides that the amount of financial assistance
 25 14 awarded to any one provider shall not exceed $200,000.
 25 15    The division modifies the permitted use of funds received
 25 16 under the program.  Under current law, grants are only
 25 17 permitted to be used for the purpose of operating costs
 25 18 incurred by the program.  The division specifies that financial
 25 19 assistance awarded to a provider shall only be used for
 25 20 the purpose of operating costs incurred by the provider in
 25 21 the provision of business development services to emerging
 25 22 and early=stage innovation companies in Iowa.  The division
 25 23 further requires that such financial assistance shall not be
 25 24 distributed to owners or investors of the company to which the
 25 25 business development services are being provided and shall not
 25 26 be provided to other persons assisting with the provision of
 25 27 the services.
 25 28    Under current law, an entrepreneurial assistance provider is
 25 29 required to accept client referrals from the EDA as a condition
 25 30 of receiving a grant.  The division provides that the EDA may
 25 31 make client referrals to eligible providers.
 25 32    DIVISION IV ==== MISCELLANEOUS CHANGES.  Division IV makes
 25 33 several miscellaneous changes to other EDA programs.  The
 25 34 division amends the sales and use tax refund available under
 25 35 the workforce housing tax incentive program.  That refund
 26  1 is available for sales and use tax paid prior to project
 26  2 completion, which is currently defined to mean the first date
 26  3 upon which the average annualized production of finished
 26  4 product for the preceding 90=day period at the manufacturing
 26  5 facility operated by the eligible business is at least 50
 26  6 percent of the initial design capacity of the facility.  The
 26  7 division amends the definition of "project completion" to mean
 26  8 the date on which the EDA notifies the department of revenue
 26  9 that all applicable requirements of a workforce housing tax
 26 10 incentive program agreement are satisfied.  This provision
 26 11 takes effect upon enactment and applies retroactively to July
 26 12 1, 2014, for all workforce housing tax incentive agreements
 26 13 entered into on or after that date.
 26 14    The division allows the EDA to extend the project
 26 15 completion date for a project awarded tax incentives under the
 26 16 redevelopment tax credit program and the housing enterprise
 26 17 zone tax incentives program if the property that is the subject
 26 18 of the project suffered a catastrophic fire during the 2014
 26 19 calendar year.

 22 21 directors, officers, and employees have an appropriate level
 22 22 of experience such that an entrepreneurial assistance program
 22 23 would not materially change the prospects of the business.
 22 24 The EDA is allowed to consult with outside service providers
 22 25 in considering such a waiver.  The division increases from $5
 22 26 million to $10 million the maximum amount of net worth that
 22 27 a business may have to be considered a qualifying business.
 22 28 The division increases from $250,000 to $500,000 the amount of
 22 29 financing that a business must have in order to be considered a
 22 30 qualifying business, removes "near equity" from the types of
 22 31 financing that will be considered in that calculation, requires
 22 32 that the financing be secured at the time of application for
 22 33 the tax credits, and requires that the business have at least
 22 34 two investors at the time of application for the tax credits.
 22 35 These modified eligibility requirements apply to businesses
 23  1 that submit an application to the EDA to be registered as a
 23  2 qualifying business on or after the effective date of this
 23  3 division of the bill, and businesses that submitted such an
 23  4 application to the EDA before the effective date of this
 23  5 division of the bill shall be governed by current law.
 23  6    The division provides for the confidentiality of certain
 23  7 information with regard to the tax credit.  The identity of
 23  8 a qualifying business, the identity of an investor and the
 23  9 qualifying business in which the investor made an equity
 23 10 investment, and the total number and amount of tax credits
 23 11 issued shall be considered public information under Code
 23 12 chapter 22 (examination of public records), but any other
 23 13 information or record in the possession of the EDA with respect
 23 14 to the program shall be presumed by the EDA to be a trade secret
 23 15 protected under Code chapter 550 or common law and shall be
 23 16 kept confidential by the EDA unless otherwise ordered by a
 23 17 court.
 23 18    The division takes effect upon enactment and applies to
 23 19 equity investments in a qualifying business made on or after
 23 20 that date.  Equity investments in a qualifying business or
 23 21 community=based seed capital fund made prior to the effective
 23 22 date of the division shall be governed by current law.
 23 23    DIVISION III ==== ENTREPRENEUR INVESTMENT AWARDS PROGRAM.
 23 24  Division III amends the entrepreneur investment awards program
 23 25 administered by the EDA.  The division strikes provisions that
 23 26 prohibited the EDA from making awards under the program since
 23 27 July 1, 2014, and that required the EDA by December 31, 2014,
 23 28 to conduct a comprehensive review of the program and submit
 23 29 a report with specified information to the governor and the

 23 31    The division modifies the purpose of the program to be
 23 32 to provide financial assistance to eligible entrepreneurial
 23 33 assistance providers (provider) that provide technical and
 23 34 financial assistance to entrepreneurs and start=up companies
 23 35 seeking to create, locate, or expand a business in Iowa.
 24  1 "Financial assistance" is defined in the division.
 24  2    The division changes the requirements for receiving an

 24  5 an Iowa=based business, expended at least $500,000 during
 24  6 the previous fiscal year to provide technical and financial

 24 15 in Iowa and that the provider offer a comprehensive set of
 24 16 business development services to emerging and early=stage
 24 17 innovation companies to assist in the creation, location,

 24 24    Under current law, the EDA board could approve, deny, or
 24 25 defer each application for a grant, and was required to award
 24 26 grants on a first=come, first=served basis.  The division
 24 27 specifies that the EDA board has the discretion to approve,
 24 28 deny, or defer each application for financial assistance and
 24 29 that the amount of financial assistance awarded to a provider
 24 30 is within the discretion of the EDA.  The division requires
 24 31 the EDA to award financial assistance on a competitive basis
 24 32 and allows the EDA to develop scoring criteria and establish

 24 34 award.
 24 35    In addition to the four factors relating to the provider's

 25 21 the provision of business development services to emerging
 25 22 and early=stage innovation companies in Iowa.  The division

 23 23    DIVISION III ==== ENTREPRENEUR INVESTMENT AWARDS PROGRAM.
 23 24  Division III amends the entrepreneur investment awards program
 23 25 administered by the EDA.  The division strikes provisions that

 23 33 assistance providers (provider) that provide technical and

 24  1 "Financial assistance" is defined in the division.
 24  2    The division changes the requirements for receiving an

 24  6 the previous fiscal year to provide technical and financial

 24 16 business development services to emerging and early=stage

 24 21 location of the provider or the company and may be provided in
 24 22 consideration of equity participation in the company, a fee for
 24 23 services, or a membership agreement with the company.
 24 24    Under current law, the EDA board could approve, deny, or
 24 25 defer each application for a grant, and was required to award
 24 26 grants on a first=come, first=served basis.  The division

 24 28 deny, or defer each application for financial assistance and
 24 29 that the amount of financial assistance awarded to a provider
 24 30 is within the discretion of the EDA.  The division requires
 24 31 the EDA to award financial assistance on a competitive basis
 24 32 and allows the EDA to develop scoring criteria and establish
 24 33 minimum requirements for the receipt of a financial assistance
 24 34 award.
 24 35    In addition to the four factors relating to the provider's
 25  1 professional staff that the EDA may consider under current
 25  2 law in deciding whether to award financial assistance, the
 25  3 division provides that the EDA may also consider the service
 25  4 model and likelihood of success of the provider, the provider's
 25  5 similarity to other successful providers in the country, and
 25  6 the provider's financial need.
 25  7    The division modifies the maximum award amount for a
 25  8 recipient.  Under current law, a grant to an entrepreneur
 25  9 assistance program cannot exceed the lesser of 25 percent of
 25 10 the funds expended by the program during the previous fiscal
 25 11 year, 100 percent of the funds raised from certain persons
 25 12 by the program during the previous fiscal year, or $200,000.
 25 13 The division provides that the amount of financial assistance
 25 14 awarded to any one provider shall not exceed $200,000.
 25 15    The division modifies the permitted use of funds received
 25 16 under the program.  Under current law, grants are only
 25 17 permitted to be used for the purpose of operating costs
 25 18 incurred by the program.  The division specifies that financial
 25 19 assistance awarded to a provider shall only be used for
 25 20 the purpose of operating costs incurred by the provider in
 25 21 the provision of business development services to emerging
 25 22 and early=stage innovation companies in Iowa.  The division
 25 23 further requires that such financial assistance shall not be
 25 24 distributed to owners or investors of the company to which the
 25 25 business development services are being provided and shall not
 25 26 be provided to other persons assisting with the provision of
 25 27 the services.
 25 28    Under current law, an entrepreneurial assistance provider is
 25 29 required to accept client referrals from the EDA as a condition
 25 30 of receiving a grant.  The division provides that the EDA may
 25 31 make client referrals to eligible providers.
 25 32    DIVISION IV ==== MISCELLANEOUS CHANGES.  Division IV makes
 25 33 several miscellaneous changes to other EDA programs.  The
 25 34 division amends the sales and use tax refund available under
 25 35 the workforce housing tax incentive program.  That refund
 26  1 is available for sales and use tax paid prior to project
 26  2 completion, which is currently defined to mean the first date
 26  3 upon which the average annualized production of finished
 26  4 product for the preceding 90=day period at the manufacturing
 26  5 facility operated by the eligible business is at least 50
 26  6 percent of the initial design capacity of the facility.  The
 26  7 division amends the definition of "project completion" to mean
 26  8 the date on which the EDA notifies the department of revenue
 26  9 that all applicable requirements of a workforce housing tax
 26 10 incentive program agreement are satisfied.  This provision
 26 11 takes effect upon enactment and applies retroactively to July
 26 12 1, 2014, for all workforce housing tax incentive agreements
 26 13 entered into on or after that date.
 26 14    The division allows the EDA to extend the project
 26 15 completion date for a project awarded tax incentives under the
 26 16 redevelopment tax credit program and the housing enterprise
 26 17 zone tax incentives program if the property that is the subject
 26 18 of the project suffered a catastrophic fire during the 2014
 26 19 calendar year.

 22 21 directors, officers, and employees have an appropriate level
 22 22 of experience such that an entrepreneurial assistance program
 22 23 would not materially change the prospects of the business.
 22 24 The EDA is allowed to consult with outside service providers
 22 25 in considering such a waiver.  The division increases from $5
 22 26 million to $10 million the maximum amount of net worth that
 22 27 a business may have to be considered a qualifying business.
 22 28 The division increases from $250,000 to $500,000 the amount of
 22 29 financing that a business must have in order to be considered a
 22 30 qualifying business, removes "near equity" from the types of
 22 31 financing that will be considered in that calculation, requires
 22 32 that the financing be secured at the time of application for
 22 33 the tax credits, and requires that the business have at least
 22 34 two investors at the time of application for the tax credits.
 22 35 These modified eligibility requirements apply to businesses
 23  1 that submit an application to the EDA to be registered as a
 23  2 qualifying business on or after the effective date of this
 23  3 division of the bill, and businesses that submitted such an
 23  4 application to the EDA before the effective date of this
 23  5 division of the bill shall be governed by current law.
 23  6    The division provides for the confidentiality of certain
 23  7 information with regard to the tax credit.  The identity of
 23  8 a qualifying business, the identity of an investor and the
 23  9 qualifying business in which the investor made an equity
 23 10 investment, and the total number and amount of tax credits
 23 11 issued shall be considered public information under Code
 23 12 chapter 22 (examination of public records), but any other
 23 13 information or record in the possession of the EDA with respect
 23 14 to the program shall be presumed by the EDA to be a trade secret
 23 15 protected under Code chapter 550 or common law and shall be
 23 16 kept confidential by the EDA unless otherwise ordered by a
 23 17 court.
 23 18    The division takes effect upon enactment and applies to
 23 19 equity investments in a qualifying business made on or after
 23 20 that date.  Equity investments in a qualifying business or
 23 21 community=based seed capital fund made prior to the effective
 23 22 date of the division shall be governed by current law.
 23 23    DIVISION III ==== ENTREPRENEUR INVESTMENT AWARDS PROGRAM.
 23 24  Division III amends the entrepreneur investment awards program
 23 25 administered by the EDA.  The division strikes provisions that
 23 26 prohibited the EDA from making awards under the program since
 23 27 July 1, 2014, and that required the EDA by December 31, 2014,
 23 28 to conduct a comprehensive review of the program and submit
 23 29 a report with specified information to the governor and the
 23 30 general assembly.
 23 31    The division modifies the purpose of the program to be
 23 32 to provide financial assistance to eligible entrepreneurial
 23 33 assistance providers (provider) that provide technical and
 23 34 financial assistance to entrepreneurs and start=up companies
 23 35 seeking to create, locate, or expand a business in Iowa.
 24  1 "Financial assistance" is defined in the division.
 24  2    The division changes the requirements for receiving an
 24  3 award.  To be eligible to receive an award under current
 24  4 law, an entrepreneurial assistance program must have been
 24  5 an Iowa=based business, expended at least $500,000 during
 24  6 the previous fiscal year to provide technical and financial
 24  7 assistance services that meet the broad=based needs of
 24  8 entrepreneurs seeking to create, locate, or expand a business
 24  9 in Iowa that intends to derive more than 10 percent of its
 24 10 gross sales from markets outside Iowa; and must have engaged
 24 11 and communicated with certain other programs, funding sources,
 24 12 and entities for its entrepreneur clients.  The division
 24 13 amends the eligibility for receiving financial assistance to
 24 14 require that a provider have its principal place of operations
 24 15 in Iowa and that the provider offer a comprehensive set of
 24 16 business development services to emerging and early=stage
 24 17 innovation companies to assist in the creation, location,
 24 18 growth, and long=term success of the company in Iowa.
 24 19 "Business development services" is defined in the division.
 24 20 Business development services may be performed at the physical
 24 21 location of the provider or the company and may be provided in
 24 22 consideration of equity participation in the company, a fee for
 24 23 services, or a membership agreement with the company.
 24 24    Under current law, the EDA board could approve, deny, or
 24 25 defer each application for a grant, and was required to award
 24 26 grants on a first=come, first=served basis.  The division
 24 27 specifies that the EDA board has the discretion to approve,
 24 28 deny, or defer each application for financial assistance and
 24 29 that the amount of financial assistance awarded to a provider
 24 30 is within the discretion of the EDA.  The division requires
 24 31 the EDA to award financial assistance on a competitive basis
 24 32 and allows the EDA to develop scoring criteria and establish
 24 33 minimum requirements for the receipt of a financial assistance
 24 34 award.
 24 35    In addition to the four factors relating to the provider's
 25  1 professional staff that the EDA may consider under current
 25  2 law in deciding whether to award financial assistance, the
 25  3 division provides that the EDA may also consider the service
 25  4 model and likelihood of success of the provider, the provider's
 25  5 similarity to other successful providers in the country, and
 25  6 the provider's financial need.
 25  7    The division modifies the maximum award amount for a
 25  8 recipient.  Under current law, a grant to an entrepreneur
 25  9 assistance program cannot exceed the lesser of 25 percent of
 25 10 the funds expended by the program during the previous fiscal
 25 11 year, 100 percent of the funds raised from certain persons
 25 12 by the program during the previous fiscal year, or $200,000.
 25 13 The division provides that the amount of financial assistance
 25 14 awarded to any one provider shall not exceed $200,000.
 25 15    The division modifies the permitted use of funds received
 25 16 under the program.  Under current law, grants are only
 25 17 permitted to be used for the purpose of operating costs
 25 18 incurred by the program.  The division specifies that financial
 25 19 assistance awarded to a provider shall only be used for
 25 20 the purpose of operating costs incurred by the provider in
 25 21 the provision of business development services to emerging
 25 22 and early=stage innovation companies in Iowa.  The division
 25 23 further requires that such financial assistance shall not be
 25 24 distributed to owners or investors of the company to which the
 25 25 business development services are being provided and shall not
 25 26 be provided to other persons assisting with the provision of
 25 27 the services.
 25 28    Under current law, an entrepreneurial assistance provider is
 25 29 required to accept client referrals from the EDA as a condition
 25 30 of receiving a grant.  The division provides that the EDA may
 25 31 make client referrals to eligible providers.
 25 32    DIVISION IV ==== MISCELLANEOUS CHANGES.  Division IV makes
 25 33 several miscellaneous changes to other EDA programs.  The
 25 34 division amends the sales and use tax refund available under
 25 35 the workforce housing tax incentive program.  That refund
 26  1 is available for sales and use tax paid prior to project
 26  2 completion, which is currently defined to mean the first date
 26  3 upon which the average annualized production of finished
 26  4 product for the preceding 90=day period at the manufacturing
 26  5 facility operated by the eligible business is at least 50
 26  6 percent of the initial design capacity of the facility.  The
 26  7 division amends the definition of "project completion" to mean
 26  8 the date on which the EDA notifies the department of revenue
 26  9 that all applicable requirements of a workforce housing tax
 26 10 incentive program agreement are satisfied.  This provision
 26 11 takes effect upon enactment and applies retroactively to July
 26 12 1, 2014, for all workforce housing tax incentive agreements
 26 13 entered into on or after that date.
 26 14    The division allows the EDA to extend the project
 26 15 completion date for a project awarded tax incentives under the
 26 16 redevelopment tax credit program and the housing enterprise
 26 17 zone tax incentives program if the property that is the subject
 26 18 of the project suffered a catastrophic fire during the 2014

 22 32 that the financing be secured at the time of application for
 22 33 the tax credits, and requires that the business have at least

 22 35 These modified eligibility requirements apply to businesses
 23  1 that submit an application to the EDA to be registered as a
 23  2 qualifying business on or after the effective date of this
 23  3 division of the bill, and businesses that submitted such an
 23  4 application to the EDA before the effective date of this
 23  5 division of the bill shall be governed by current law.
 23  6    The division provides for the confidentiality of certain
 23  7 information with regard to the tax credit.  The identity of
 23  8 a qualifying business, the identity of an investor and the
 23  9 qualifying business in which the investor made an equity
 23 10 investment, and the total number and amount of tax credits
 23 11 issued shall be considered public information under Code
 23 12 chapter 22 (examination of public records), but any other
 23 13 information or record in the possession of the EDA with respect
 23 14 to the program shall be presumed by the EDA to be a trade secret
 23 15 protected under Code chapter 550 or common law and shall be
 23 16 kept confidential by the EDA unless otherwise ordered by a
 23 17 court.
 23 18    The division takes effect upon enactment and applies to

 23 23    DIVISION III ==== ENTREPRENEUR INVESTMENT AWARDS PROGRAM.
 23 24  Division III amends the entrepreneur investment awards program

 23 28 to conduct a comprehensive review of the program and submit

 25 14 awarded to any one provider shall not exceed $200,000.
 25 15    The division modifies the permitted use of funds received
 25 16 under the program.  Under current law, grants are only
 25 17 permitted to be used for the purpose of operating costs
 25 18 incurred by the program.  The division specifies that financial
 25 19 assistance awarded to a provider shall only be used for
 25 20 the purpose of operating costs incurred by the provider in
 25 21 the provision of business development services to emerging
 25 22 and early=stage innovation companies in Iowa.  The division
 25 23 further requires that such financial assistance shall not be
 25 24 distributed to owners or investors of the company to which the
 25 25 business development services are being provided and shall not
 25 26 be provided to other persons assisting with the provision of
 25 27 the services.
 25 28    Under current law, an entrepreneurial assistance provider is
 25 29 required to accept client referrals from the EDA as a condition
 25 30 of receiving a grant.  The division provides that the EDA may
 25 31 make client referrals to eligible providers.
 25 32    DIVISION IV ==== MISCELLANEOUS CHANGES.  Division IV makes
 25 33 several miscellaneous changes to other EDA programs.  The
 25 34 division amends the sales and use tax refund available under
 25 35 the workforce housing tax incentive program.  That refund
 26  1 is available for sales and use tax paid prior to project
 26  2 completion, which is currently defined to mean the first date
 26  3 upon which the average annualized production of finished
 26  4 product for the preceding 90=day period at the manufacturing
 26  5 facility operated by the eligible business is at least 50
 26  6 percent of the initial design capacity of the facility.  The
 26  7 division amends the definition of "project completion" to mean
 26  8 the date on which the EDA notifies the department of revenue
 26  9 that all applicable requirements of a workforce housing tax
 26 10 incentive program agreement are satisfied.  This provision
 26 11 takes effect upon enactment and applies retroactively to July
 26 12 1, 2014, for all workforce housing tax incentive agreements
 26 13 entered into on or after that date.
 26 14    The division allows the EDA to extend the project
 26 15 completion date for a project awarded tax incentives under the
 26 16 redevelopment tax credit program and the housing enterprise
 26 17 zone tax incentives program if the property that is the subject
 26 18 of the project suffered a catastrophic fire during the 2014
 26 19 calendar year.

       mm/sc
 22 24 The EDA is allowed to consult with outside service providers
 22 25 in considering such a waiver.  The division increases from $5
 22 26 million to $10 million the maximum amount of net worth that
 22 27 a business may have to be considered a qualifying business.
 22 28 The division increases from $250,000 to $500,000 the amount of
 22 29 financing that a business must have in order to be considered a
 22 30 qualifying business, removes "near equity" from the types of
 22 31 financing that will be considered in that calculation, requires
 22 32 that the financing be secured at the time of application for
 22 33 the tax credits, and requires that the business have at least
 22 34 two investors at the time of application for the tax credits.
 22 35 These modified eligibility requirements apply to businesses
 23  1 that submit an application to the EDA to be registered as a
 23  2 qualifying business on or after the effective date of this
 23  3 division of the bill, and businesses that submitted such an
 23  4 application to the EDA before the effective date of this
 23  5 division of the bill shall be governed by current law.
 23  6    The division provides for the confidentiality of certain
 23  7 information with regard to the tax credit.  The identity of
 23  8 a qualifying business, the identity of an investor and the
 23  9 qualifying business in which the investor made an equity
 23 10 investment, and the total number and amount of tax credits
 23 11 issued shall be considered public information under Code
 23 12 chapter 22 (examination of public records), but any other
 23 13 information or record in the possession of the EDA with respect
 23 14 to the program shall be presumed by the EDA to be a trade secret
 23 15 protected under Code chapter 550 or common law and shall be
 23 16 kept confidential by the EDA unless otherwise ordered by a
 23 17 court.
 23 18    The division takes effect upon enactment and applies to
 23 19 equity investments in a qualifying business made on or after
 23 20 that date.  Equity investments in a qualifying business or
 23 21 community=based seed capital fund made prior to the effective
 23 22 date of the division shall be governed by current law.
 23 23    DIVISION III ==== ENTREPRENEUR INVESTMENT AWARDS PROGRAM.
 23 24  Division III amends the entrepreneur investment awards program
 23 25 administered by the EDA.  The division strikes provisions that
 23 26 prohibited the EDA from making awards under the program since
 23 27 July 1, 2014, and that required the EDA by December 31, 2014,
 23 28 to conduct a comprehensive review of the program and submit
 23 29 a report with specified information to the governor and the
 23 30 general assembly.
 23 31    The division modifies the purpose of the program to be
 23 32 to provide financial assistance to eligible entrepreneurial
 23 33 assistance providers (provider) that provide technical and
 23 34 financial assistance to entrepreneurs and start=up companies
 23 35 seeking to create, locate, or expand a business in Iowa.
 24  1 "Financial assistance" is defined in the division.
 24  2    The division changes the requirements for receiving an
 24  3 award.  To be eligible to receive an award under current
 24  4 law, an entrepreneurial assistance program must have been
 24  5 an Iowa=based business, expended at least $500,000 during
 24  6 the previous fiscal year to provide technical and financial
 24  7 assistance services that meet the broad=based needs of
 24  8 entrepreneurs seeking to create, locate, or expand a business
 24  9 in Iowa that intends to derive more than 10 percent of its
 24 10 gross sales from markets outside Iowa; and must have engaged
 24 11 and communicated with certain other programs, funding sources,
 24 12 and entities for its entrepreneur clients.  The division
 24 13 amends the eligibility for receiving financial assistance to
 24 14 require that a provider have its principal place of operations
 24 15 in Iowa and that the provider offer a comprehensive set of
 24 16 business development services to emerging and early=stage
 24 17 innovation companies to assist in the creation, location,
 24 18 growth, and long=term success of the company in Iowa.
 24 19 "Business development services" is defined in the division.
 24 20 Business development services may be performed at the physical
 24 21 location of the provider or the company and may be provided in
 24 22 consideration of equity participation in the company, a fee for
 24 23 services, or a membership agreement with the company.
 24 24    Under current law, the EDA board could approve, deny, or
 24 25 defer each application for a grant, and was required to award
 24 26 grants on a first=come, first=served basis.  The division
 24 27 specifies that the EDA board has the discretion to approve,
 24 28 deny, or defer each application for financial assistance and
 24 29 that the amount of financial assistance awarded to a provider
 24 30 is within the discretion of the EDA.  The division requires
 24 31 the EDA to award financial assistance on a competitive basis
 24 32 and allows the EDA to develop scoring criteria and establish
 24 33 minimum requirements for the receipt of a financial assistance
 24 34 award.
 24 35    In addition to the four factors relating to the provider's
 25  1 professional staff that the EDA may consider under current
 25  2 law in deciding whether to award financial assistance, the
 25  3 division provides that the EDA may also consider the service
 25  4 model and likelihood of success of the provider, the provider's
 25  5 similarity to other successful providers in the country, and
 25  6 the provider's financial need.
 25  7    The division modifies the maximum award amount for a
 25  8 recipient.  Under current law, a grant to an entrepreneur
 25  9 assistance program cannot exceed the lesser of 25 percent of
 25 10 the funds expended by the program during the previous fiscal
 25 11 year, 100 percent of the funds raised from certain persons
 25 12 by the program during the previous fiscal year, or $200,000.
 25 13 The division provides that the amount of financial assistance
 25 14 awarded to any one provider shall not exceed $200,000.
 25 15    The division modifies the permitted use of funds received
 25 16 under the program.  Under current law, grants are only
 25 17 permitted to be used for the purpose of operating costs
 25 18 incurred by the program.  The division specifies that financial
 25 19 assistance awarded to a provider shall only be used for
 25 20 the purpose of operating costs incurred by the provider in
 25 21 the provision of business development services to emerging
 25 22 and early=stage innovation companies in Iowa.  The division
 25 23 further requires that such financial assistance shall not be
 25 24 distributed to owners or investors of the company to which the
 25 25 business development services are being provided and shall not
 25 26 be provided to other persons assisting with the provision of
 25 27 the services.
 25 28    Under current law, an entrepreneurial assistance provider is
 25 29 required to accept client referrals from the EDA as a condition
 25 30 of receiving a grant.  The division provides that the EDA may
 25 31 make client referrals to eligible providers.
 25 32    DIVISION IV ==== MISCELLANEOUS CHANGES.  Division IV makes
 25 33 several miscellaneous changes to other EDA programs.  The
 25 34 division amends the sales and use tax refund available under
 25 35 the workforce housing tax incentive program.  That refund

 26  2 completion, which is currently defined to mean the first date

 26  4 product for the preceding 90=day period at the manufacturing
 26  5 facility operated by the eligible business is at least 50
 26  6 percent of the initial design capacity of the facility.  The
 26  7 division amends the definition of "project completion" to mean
 26  8 the date on which the EDA notifies the department of revenue
 26  9 that all applicable requirements of a workforce housing tax
 26 10 incentive program agreement are satisfied.  This provision
 26 11 takes effect upon enactment and applies retroactively to July
 26 12 1, 2014, for all workforce housing tax incentive agreements
 26 13 entered into on or after that date.
 26 14    The division allows the EDA to extend the project
 26 15 completion date for a project awarded tax incentives under the
 26 16 redevelopment tax credit program and the housing enterprise
 26 17 zone tax incentives program if the property that is the subject

 23  7 information with regard to the tax credit.  The identity of
 23  8 a qualifying business, the identity of an investor and the
 23  9 qualifying business in which the investor made an equity
 23 10 investment, and the total number and amount of tax credits
 23 11 issued shall be considered public information under Code
 23 12 chapter 22 (examination of public records), but any other
 23 13 information or record in the possession of the EDA with respect
 23 14 to the program shall be presumed by the EDA to be a trade secret
 23 15 protected under Code chapter 550 or common law and shall be
 23 16 kept confidential by the EDA unless otherwise ordered by a
 23 17 court.
 23 18    The division takes effect upon enactment and applies to
 23 19 equity investments in a qualifying business made on or after

 26  2 completion, which is currently defined to mean the first date
 26  3 upon which the average annualized production of finished
 26  4 product for the preceding 90=day period at the manufacturing
 26  5 facility operated by the eligible business is at least 50
 26  6 percent of the initial design capacity of the facility.  The
 26  7 division amends the definition of "project completion" to mean
 26  8 the date on which the EDA notifies the department of revenue
 26  9 that all applicable requirements of a workforce housing tax
 26 10 incentive program agreement are satisfied.  This provision
 26 11 takes effect upon enactment and applies retroactively to July
 26 12 1, 2014, for all workforce housing tax incentive agreements
 26 13 entered into on or after that date.
 26 14    The division allows the EDA to extend the project
 26 15 completion date for a project awarded tax incentives under the
 26 16 redevelopment tax credit program and the housing enterprise
 26 17 zone tax incentives program if the property that is the subject
 26 18 of the project suffered a catastrophic fire during the 2014
 26 19 calendar year.

 22 27 a business may have to be considered a qualifying business.
 22 28 The division increases from $250,000 to $500,000 the amount of
 22 29 financing that a business must have in order to be considered a
 22 30 qualifying business, removes "near equity" from the types of
 22 31 financing that will be considered in that calculation, requires
 22 32 that the financing be secured at the time of application for
 22 33 the tax credits, and requires that the business have at least
 22 34 two investors at the time of application for the tax credits.
 22 35 These modified eligibility requirements apply to businesses
 23  1 that submit an application to the EDA to be registered as a
 23  2 qualifying business on or after the effective date of this
 23  3 division of the bill, and businesses that submitted such an
 23  4 application to the EDA before the effective date of this
 23  5 division of the bill shall be governed by current law.
 23  6    The division provides for the confidentiality of certain
 23  7 information with regard to the tax credit.  The identity of
 23  8 a qualifying business, the identity of an investor and the
 23  9 qualifying business in which the investor made an equity
 23 10 investment, and the total number and amount of tax credits
 23 11 issued shall be considered public information under Code
 23 12 chapter 22 (examination of public records), but any other
 23 13 information or record in the possession of the EDA with respect
 23 14 to the program shall be presumed by the EDA to be a trade secret
 23 15 protected under Code chapter 550 or common law and shall be
 23 16 kept confidential by the EDA unless otherwise ordered by a
 23 17 court.
 23 18    The division takes effect upon enactment and applies to
 23 19 equity investments in a qualifying business made on or after
 23 20 that date.  Equity investments in a qualifying business or
 23 21 community=based seed capital fund made prior to the effective
 23 22 date of the division shall be governed by current law.
 23 23    DIVISION III ==== ENTREPRENEUR INVESTMENT AWARDS PROGRAM.
 23 24  Division III amends the entrepreneur investment awards program
 23 25 administered by the EDA.  The division strikes provisions that
 23 26 prohibited the EDA from making awards under the program since
 23 27 July 1, 2014, and that required the EDA by December 31, 2014,
 23 28 to conduct a comprehensive review of the program and submit
 23 29 a report with specified information to the governor and the
 23 30 general assembly.
 23 31    The division modifies the purpose of the program to be
 23 32 to provide financial assistance to eligible entrepreneurial
 23 33 assistance providers (provider) that provide technical and
 23 34 financial assistance to entrepreneurs and start=up companies
 23 35 seeking to create, locate, or expand a business in Iowa.
 24  1 "Financial assistance" is defined in the division.
 24  2    The division changes the requirements for receiving an
 24  3 award.  To be eligible to receive an award under current
 24  4 law, an entrepreneurial assistance program must have been
 24  5 an Iowa=based business, expended at least $500,000 during
 24  6 the previous fiscal year to provide technical and financial
 24  7 assistance services that meet the broad=based needs of
 24  8 entrepreneurs seeking to create, locate, or expand a business
 24  9 in Iowa that intends to derive more than 10 percent of its
 24 10 gross sales from markets outside Iowa; and must have engaged
 24 11 and communicated with certain other programs, funding sources,
 24 12 and entities for its entrepreneur clients.  The division
 24 13 amends the eligibility for receiving financial assistance to
 24 14 require that a provider have its principal place of operations
 24 15 in Iowa and that the provider offer a comprehensive set of
 24 16 business development services to emerging and early=stage
 24 17 innovation companies to assist in the creation, location,
 24 18 growth, and long=term success of the company in Iowa.
 24 19 "Business development services" is defined in the division.
 24 20 Business development services may be performed at the physical
 24 21 location of the provider or the company and may be provided in
 24 22 consideration of equity participation in the company, a fee for
 24 23 services, or a membership agreement with the company.
 24 24    Under current law, the EDA board could approve, deny, or
 24 25 defer each application for a grant, and was required to award
 24 26 grants on a first=come, first=served basis.  The division
 24 27 specifies that the EDA board has the discretion to approve,
 24 28 deny, or defer each application for financial assistance and
 24 29 that the amount of financial assistance awarded to a provider
 24 30 is within the discretion of the EDA.  The division requires
 24 31 the EDA to award financial assistance on a competitive basis
 24 32 and allows the EDA to develop scoring criteria and establish
 24 33 minimum requirements for the receipt of a financial assistance
 24 34 award.
 24 35    In addition to the four factors relating to the provider's
 25  1 professional staff that the EDA may consider under current
 25  2 law in deciding whether to award financial assistance, the
 25  3 division provides that the EDA may also consider the service
 25  4 model and likelihood of success of the provider, the provider's
 25  5 similarity to other successful providers in the country, and
 25  6 the provider's financial need.
 25  7    The division modifies the maximum award amount for a
 25  8 recipient.  Under current law, a grant to an entrepreneur
 25  9 assistance program cannot exceed the lesser of 25 percent of
 25 10 the funds expended by the program during the previous fiscal
 25 11 year, 100 percent of the funds raised from certain persons
 25 12 by the program during the previous fiscal year, or $200,000.
 25 13 The division provides that the amount of financial assistance
 25 14 awarded to any one provider shall not exceed $200,000.
 25 15    The division modifies the permitted use of funds received
 25 16 under the program.  Under current law, grants are only
 25 17 permitted to be used for the purpose of operating costs
 25 18 incurred by the program.  The division specifies that financial
 25 19 assistance awarded to a provider shall only be used for
 25 20 the purpose of operating costs incurred by the provider in
 25 21 the provision of business development services to emerging
 25 22 and early=stage innovation companies in Iowa.  The division
 25 23 further requires that such financial assistance shall not be
 25 24 distributed to owners or investors of the company to which the
 25 25 business development services are being provided and shall not
 25 26 be provided to other persons assisting with the provision of
 25 27 the services.
 25 28    Under current law, an entrepreneurial assistance provider is
 25 29 required to accept client referrals from the EDA as a condition
 25 30 of receiving a grant.  The division provides that the EDA may
 25 31 make client referrals to eligible providers.
 25 32    DIVISION IV ==== MISCELLANEOUS CHANGES.  Division IV makes
 25 33 several miscellaneous changes to other EDA programs.  The
 25 34 division amends the sales and use tax refund available under
 25 35 the workforce housing tax incentive program.  That refund
 26  1 is available for sales and use tax paid prior to project
 26  2 completion, which is currently defined to mean the first date
 26  3 upon which the average annualized production of finished
 26  4 product for the preceding 90=day period at the manufacturing
 26  5 facility operated by the eligible business is at least 50
 26  6 percent of the initial design capacity of the facility.  The
 26  7 division amends the definition of "project completion" to mean
 26  8 the date on which the EDA notifies the department of revenue
 26  9 that all applicable requirements of a workforce housing tax
 26 10 incentive program agreement are satisfied.  This provision
 26 11 takes effect upon enactment and applies retroactively to July
 26 12 1, 2014, for all workforce housing tax incentive agreements
 26 13 entered into on or after that date.
 26 14    The division allows the EDA to extend the project
 26 15 completion date for a project awarded tax incentives under the
 26 16 redevelopment tax credit program and the housing enterprise
 26 17 zone tax incentives program if the property that is the subject
 26 18 of the project suffered a catastrophic fire during the 2014
 26 19 calendar year.

 22 31 financing that will be considered in that calculation, requires
 22 32 that the financing be secured at the time of application for
 22 33 the tax credits, and requires that the business have at least

 22 35 These modified eligibility requirements apply to businesses
 23  1 that submit an application to the EDA to be registered as a
 23  2 qualifying business on or after the effective date of this
 23  3 division of the bill, and businesses that submitted such an
 23  4 application to the EDA before the effective date of this
 23  5 division of the bill shall be governed by current law.
 23  6    The division provides for the confidentiality of certain
 23  7 information with regard to the tax credit.  The identity of
 23  8 a qualifying business, the identity of an investor and the
 23  9 qualifying business in which the investor made an equity
 23 10 investment, and the total number and amount of tax credits
 23 11 issued shall be considered public information under Code
 23 12 chapter 22 (examination of public records), but any other
 23 13 information or record in the possession of the EDA with respect
 23 14 to the program shall be presumed by the EDA to be a trade secret
 23 15 protected under Code chapter 550 or common law and shall be
 23 16 kept confidential by the EDA unless otherwise ordered by a
 23 17 court.
 23 18    The division takes effect upon enactment and applies to
 23 19 equity investments in a qualifying business made on or after
 23 20 that date.  Equity investments in a qualifying business or
 23 21 community=based seed capital fund made prior to the effective
 23 22 date of the division shall be governed by current law.
 23 23    DIVISION III ==== ENTREPRENEUR INVESTMENT AWARDS PROGRAM.
 23 24  Division III amends the entrepreneur investment awards program
 23 25 administered by the EDA.  The division strikes provisions that
 23 26 prohibited the EDA from making awards under the program since
 23 27 July 1, 2014, and that required the EDA by December 31, 2014,
 23 28 to conduct a comprehensive review of the program and submit

 23 31    The division modifies the purpose of the program to be
 23 32 to provide financial assistance to eligible entrepreneurial
 23 33 assistance providers (provider) that provide technical and
 23 34 financial assistance to entrepreneurs and start=up companies
 23 35 seeking to create, locate, or expand a business in Iowa.
 24  1 "Financial assistance" is defined in the division.
 24  2    The division changes the requirements for receiving an
 24  3 award.  To be eligible to receive an award under current
 24  4 law, an entrepreneurial assistance program must have been
 24  5 an Iowa=based business, expended at least $500,000 during
 24  6 the previous fiscal year to provide technical and financial

 24  9 in Iowa that intends to derive more than 10 percent of its
 24 10 gross sales from markets outside Iowa; and must have engaged
 24 11 and communicated with certain other programs, funding sources,
 24 12 and entities for its entrepreneur clients.  The division
 24 13 amends the eligibility for receiving financial assistance to
 24 14 require that a provider have its principal place of operations
 24 15 in Iowa and that the provider offer a comprehensive set of
 24 16 business development services to emerging and early=stage
 24 17 innovation companies to assist in the creation, location,

 24 19 "Business development services" is defined in the division.
 24 20 Business development services may be performed at the physical
 24 21 location of the provider or the company and may be provided in
 24 22 consideration of equity participation in the company, a fee for
 24 23 services, or a membership agreement with the company.
 24 24    Under current law, the EDA board could approve, deny, or
 24 25 defer each application for a grant, and was required to award
 24 26 grants on a first=come, first=served basis.  The division
 24 27 specifies that the EDA board has the discretion to approve,
 24 28 deny, or defer each application for financial assistance and
 24 29 that the amount of financial assistance awarded to a provider
 24 30 is within the discretion of the EDA.  The division requires
 24 31 the EDA to award financial assistance on a competitive basis
 24 32 and allows the EDA to develop scoring criteria and establish
 24 33 minimum requirements for the receipt of a financial assistance
 24 34 award.
 24 35    In addition to the four factors relating to the provider's
 25  1 professional staff that the EDA may consider under current
 25  2 law in deciding whether to award financial assistance, the
 25  3 division provides that the EDA may also consider the service
 25  4 model and likelihood of success of the provider, the provider's
 25  5 similarity to other successful providers in the country, and
 25  6 the provider's financial need.
 25  7    The division modifies the maximum award amount for a
 25  8 recipient.  Under current law, a grant to an entrepreneur
 25  9 assistance program cannot exceed the lesser of 25 percent of
 25 10 the funds expended by the program during the previous fiscal
 25 11 year, 100 percent of the funds raised from certain persons

 25 13 The division provides that the amount of financial assistance
 25 14 awarded to any one provider shall not exceed $200,000.
 25 15    The division modifies the permitted use of funds received
 25 16 under the program.  Under current law, grants are only
 25 17 permitted to be used for the purpose of operating costs
 25 18 incurred by the program.  The division specifies that financial
 25 19 assistance awarded to a provider shall only be used for
 25 20 the purpose of operating costs incurred by the provider in
 25 21 the provision of business development services to emerging
 25 22 and early=stage innovation companies in Iowa.  The division
 25 23 further requires that such financial assistance shall not be
 25 24 distributed to owners or investors of the company to which the
 25 25 business development services are being provided and shall not
 25 26 be provided to other persons assisting with the provision of
 25 27 the services.
 25 28    Under current law, an entrepreneurial assistance provider is
 25 29 required to accept client referrals from the EDA as a condition
 25 30 of receiving a grant.  The division provides that the EDA may
 25 31 make client referrals to eligible providers.
 25 32    DIVISION IV ==== MISCELLANEOUS CHANGES.  Division IV makes
 25 33 several miscellaneous changes to other EDA programs.  The
 25 34 division amends the sales and use tax refund available under
 25 35 the workforce housing tax incentive program.  That refund
 26  1 is available for sales and use tax paid prior to project
 26  2 completion, which is currently defined to mean the first date

 26  5 facility operated by the eligible business is at least 50
 26  6 percent of the initial design capacity of the facility.  The
 26  7 division amends the definition of "project completion" to mean

 26 13 entered into on or after that date.
 26 14    The division allows the EDA to extend the project

 22 35 These modified eligibility requirements apply to businesses
 23  1 that submit an application to the EDA to be registered as a

 23 23    DIVISION III ==== ENTREPRENEUR INVESTMENT AWARDS PROGRAM.
 23 24  Division III amends the entrepreneur investment awards program
 23 25 administered by the EDA.  The division strikes provisions that
 23 26 prohibited the EDA from making awards under the program since
 23 27 July 1, 2014, and that required the EDA by December 31, 2014,
 23 28 to conduct a comprehensive review of the program and submit
 23 29 a report with specified information to the governor and the
 23 30 general assembly.
 23 31    The division modifies the purpose of the program to be
 23 32 to provide financial assistance to eligible entrepreneurial
 23 33 assistance providers (provider) that provide technical and
 23 34 financial assistance to entrepreneurs and start=up companies
 23 35 seeking to create, locate, or expand a business in Iowa.
 24  1 "Financial assistance" is defined in the division.
 24  2    The division changes the requirements for receiving an
 24  3 award.  To be eligible to receive an award under current
 24  4 law, an entrepreneurial assistance program must have been
 24  5 an Iowa=based business, expended at least $500,000 during
 24  6 the previous fiscal year to provide technical and financial
 24  7 assistance services that meet the broad=based needs of
 24  8 entrepreneurs seeking to create, locate, or expand a business
 24  9 in Iowa that intends to derive more than 10 percent of its
 24 10 gross sales from markets outside Iowa; and must have engaged
 24 11 and communicated with certain other programs, funding sources,
 24 12 and entities for its entrepreneur clients.  The division
 24 13 amends the eligibility for receiving financial assistance to
 24 14 require that a provider have its principal place of operations
 24 15 in Iowa and that the provider offer a comprehensive set of
 24 16 business development services to emerging and early=stage
 24 17 innovation companies to assist in the creation, location,
 24 18 growth, and long=term success of the company in Iowa.
 24 19 "Business development services" is defined in the division.
 24 20 Business development services may be performed at the physical
 24 21 location of the provider or the company and may be provided in
 24 22 consideration of equity participation in the company, a fee for
 24 23 services, or a membership agreement with the company.
 24 24    Under current law, the EDA board could approve, deny, or
 24 25 defer each application for a grant, and was required to award
 24 26 grants on a first=come, first=served basis.  The division
 24 27 specifies that the EDA board has the discretion to approve,
 24 28 deny, or defer each application for financial assistance and
 24 29 that the amount of financial assistance awarded to a provider
 24 30 is within the discretion of the EDA.  The division requires
 24 31 the EDA to award financial assistance on a competitive basis
 24 32 and allows the EDA to develop scoring criteria and establish
 24 33 minimum requirements for the receipt of a financial assistance
 24 34 award.
 24 35    In addition to the four factors relating to the provider's
 25  1 professional staff that the EDA may consider under current
 25  2 law in deciding whether to award financial assistance, the
 25  3 division provides that the EDA may also consider the service
 25  4 model and likelihood of success of the provider, the provider's
 25  5 similarity to other successful providers in the country, and
 25  6 the provider's financial need.
 25  7    The division modifies the maximum award amount for a
 25  8 recipient.  Under current law, a grant to an entrepreneur
 25  9 assistance program cannot exceed the lesser of 25 percent of
 25 10 the funds expended by the program during the previous fiscal
 25 11 year, 100 percent of the funds raised from certain persons
 25 12 by the program during the previous fiscal year, or $200,000.
 25 13 The division provides that the amount of financial assistance
 25 14 awarded to any one provider shall not exceed $200,000.
 25 15    The division modifies the permitted use of funds received
 25 16 under the program.  Under current law, grants are only
 25 17 permitted to be used for the purpose of operating costs
 25 18 incurred by the program.  The division specifies that financial
 25 19 assistance awarded to a provider shall only be used for
 25 20 the purpose of operating costs incurred by the provider in
 25 21 the provision of business development services to emerging
 25 22 and early=stage innovation companies in Iowa.  The division
 25 23 further requires that such financial assistance shall not be
 25 24 distributed to owners or investors of the company to which the
 25 25 business development services are being provided and shall not
 25 26 be provided to other persons assisting with the provision of
 25 27 the services.
 25 28    Under current law, an entrepreneurial assistance provider is
 25 29 required to accept client referrals from the EDA as a condition
 25 30 of receiving a grant.  The division provides that the EDA may
 25 31 make client referrals to eligible providers.
 25 32    DIVISION IV ==== MISCELLANEOUS CHANGES.  Division IV makes
 25 33 several miscellaneous changes to other EDA programs.  The
 25 34 division amends the sales and use tax refund available under
 25 35 the workforce housing tax incentive program.  That refund
 26  1 is available for sales and use tax paid prior to project
 26  2 completion, which is currently defined to mean the first date
 26  3 upon which the average annualized production of finished
 26  4 product for the preceding 90=day period at the manufacturing
 26  5 facility operated by the eligible business is at least 50
 26  6 percent of the initial design capacity of the facility.  The
 26  7 division amends the definition of "project completion" to mean
 26  8 the date on which the EDA notifies the department of revenue
 26  9 that all applicable requirements of a workforce housing tax
 26 10 incentive program agreement are satisfied.  This provision
 26 11 takes effect upon enactment and applies retroactively to July
 26 12 1, 2014, for all workforce housing tax incentive agreements
 26 13 entered into on or after that date.
 26 14    The division allows the EDA to extend the project
 26 15 completion date for a project awarded tax incentives under the
 26 16 redevelopment tax credit program and the housing enterprise
 26 17 zone tax incentives program if the property that is the subject
 26 18 of the project suffered a catastrophic fire during the 2014

 23  6    The division provides for the confidentiality of certain
 23  7 information with regard to the tax credit.  The identity of
 23  8 a qualifying business, the identity of an investor and the
 23  9 qualifying business in which the investor made an equity
 23 10 investment, and the total number and amount of tax credits
 23 11 issued shall be considered public information under Code
 23 12 chapter 22 (examination of public records), but any other
 23 13 information or record in the possession of the EDA with respect
 23 14 to the program shall be presumed by the EDA to be a trade secret
 23 15 protected under Code chapter 550 or common law and shall be
 23 16 kept confidential by the EDA unless otherwise ordered by a
 23 17 court.
 23 18    The division takes effect upon enactment and applies to
 23 19 equity investments in a qualifying business made on or after

 23 21 community=based seed capital fund made prior to the effective
 23 22 date of the division shall be governed by current law.
 23 23    DIVISION III ==== ENTREPRENEUR INVESTMENT AWARDS PROGRAM.
 23 24  Division III amends the entrepreneur investment awards program
 23 25 administered by the EDA.  The division strikes provisions that
 23 26 prohibited the EDA from making awards under the program since
 23 27 July 1, 2014, and that required the EDA by December 31, 2014,
 23 28 to conduct a comprehensive review of the program and submit
 23 29 a report with specified information to the governor and the
 23 30 general assembly.
 23 31    The division modifies the purpose of the program to be
 23 32 to provide financial assistance to eligible entrepreneurial
 23 33 assistance providers (provider) that provide technical and
 23 34 financial assistance to entrepreneurs and start=up companies
 23 35 seeking to create, locate, or expand a business in Iowa.
 24  1 "Financial assistance" is defined in the division.
 24  2    The division changes the requirements for receiving an
 24  3 award.  To be eligible to receive an award under current
 24  4 law, an entrepreneurial assistance program must have been
 24  5 an Iowa=based business, expended at least $500,000 during
 24  6 the previous fiscal year to provide technical and financial
 24  7 assistance services that meet the broad=based needs of
 24  8 entrepreneurs seeking to create, locate, or expand a business
 24  9 in Iowa that intends to derive more than 10 percent of its
 24 10 gross sales from markets outside Iowa; and must have engaged
 24 11 and communicated with certain other programs, funding sources,
 24 12 and entities for its entrepreneur clients.  The division
 24 13 amends the eligibility for receiving financial assistance to
 24 14 require that a provider have its principal place of operations
 24 15 in Iowa and that the provider offer a comprehensive set of
 24 16 business development services to emerging and early=stage
 24 17 innovation companies to assist in the creation, location,
 24 18 growth, and long=term success of the company in Iowa.
 24 19 "Business development services" is defined in the division.
 24 20 Business development services may be performed at the physical
 24 21 location of the provider or the company and may be provided in
 24 22 consideration of equity participation in the company, a fee for
 24 23 services, or a membership agreement with the company.
 24 24    Under current law, the EDA board could approve, deny, or
 24 25 defer each application for a grant, and was required to award
 24 26 grants on a first=come, first=served basis.  The division
 24 27 specifies that the EDA board has the discretion to approve,
 24 28 deny, or defer each application for financial assistance and
 24 29 that the amount of financial assistance awarded to a provider
 24 30 is within the discretion of the EDA.  The division requires
 24 31 the EDA to award financial assistance on a competitive basis
 24 32 and allows the EDA to develop scoring criteria and establish
 24 33 minimum requirements for the receipt of a financial assistance
 24 34 award.
 24 35    In addition to the four factors relating to the provider's
 25  1 professional staff that the EDA may consider under current
 25  2 law in deciding whether to award financial assistance, the
 25  3 division provides that the EDA may also consider the service
 25  4 model and likelihood of success of the provider, the provider's
 25  5 similarity to other successful providers in the country, and
 25  6 the provider's financial need.
 25  7    The division modifies the maximum award amount for a
 25  8 recipient.  Under current law, a grant to an entrepreneur
 25  9 assistance program cannot exceed the lesser of 25 percent of
 25 10 the funds expended by the program during the previous fiscal
 25 11 year, 100 percent of the funds raised from certain persons
 25 12 by the program during the previous fiscal year, or $200,000.
 25 13 The division provides that the amount of financial assistance
 25 14 awarded to any one provider shall not exceed $200,000.
 25 15    The division modifies the permitted use of funds received
 25 16 under the program.  Under current law, grants are only
 25 17 permitted to be used for the purpose of operating costs
 25 18 incurred by the program.  The division specifies that financial
 25 19 assistance awarded to a provider shall only be used for
 25 20 the purpose of operating costs incurred by the provider in
 25 21 the provision of business development services to emerging
 25 22 and early=stage innovation companies in Iowa.  The division
 25 23 further requires that such financial assistance shall not be
 25 24 distributed to owners or investors of the company to which the
 25 25 business development services are being provided and shall not
 25 26 be provided to other persons assisting with the provision of
 25 27 the services.
 25 28    Under current law, an entrepreneurial assistance provider is
 25 29 required to accept client referrals from the EDA as a condition
 25 30 of receiving a grant.  The division provides that the EDA may
 25 31 make client referrals to eligible providers.
 25 32    DIVISION IV ==== MISCELLANEOUS CHANGES.  Division IV makes
 25 33 several miscellaneous changes to other EDA programs.  The
 25 34 division amends the sales and use tax refund available under
 25 35 the workforce housing tax incentive program.  That refund
 26  1 is available for sales and use tax paid prior to project
 26  2 completion, which is currently defined to mean the first date
 26  3 upon which the average annualized production of finished
 26  4 product for the preceding 90=day period at the manufacturing
 26  5 facility operated by the eligible business is at least 50
 26  6 percent of the initial design capacity of the facility.  The
 26  7 division amends the definition of "project completion" to mean
 26  8 the date on which the EDA notifies the department of revenue
 26  9 that all applicable requirements of a workforce housing tax
 26 10 incentive program agreement are satisfied.  This provision
 26 11 takes effect upon enactment and applies retroactively to July
 26 12 1, 2014, for all workforce housing tax incentive agreements
 26 13 entered into on or after that date.
 26 14    The division allows the EDA to extend the project
 26 15 completion date for a project awarded tax incentives under the
 26 16 redevelopment tax credit program and the housing enterprise
 26 17 zone tax incentives program if the property that is the subject
 26 18 of the project suffered a catastrophic fire during the 2014
 26 19 calendar year.

       mm/sc
 22 31 financing that will be considered in that calculation, requires
 22 32 that the financing be secured at the time of application for
 22 33 the tax credits, and requires that the business have at least
 22 34 two investors at the time of application for the tax credits.
 22 35 These modified eligibility requirements apply to businesses
 23  1 that submit an application to the EDA to be registered as a
 23  2 qualifying business on or after the effective date of this
 23  3 division of the bill, and businesses that submitted such an
 23  4 application to the EDA before the effective date of this
 23  5 division of the bill shall be governed by current law.
 23  6    The division provides for the confidentiality of certain
 23  7 information with regard to the tax credit.  The identity of
 23  8 a qualifying business, the identity of an investor and the
 23  9 qualifying business in which the investor made an equity
 23 10 investment, and the total number and amount of tax credits
 23 11 issued shall be considered public information under Code
 23 12 chapter 22 (examination of public records), but any other
 23 13 information or record in the possession of the EDA with respect
 23 14 to the program shall be presumed by the EDA to be a trade secret
 23 15 protected under Code chapter 550 or common law and shall be
 23 16 kept confidential by the EDA unless otherwise ordered by a
 23 17 court.
 23 18    The division takes effect upon enactment and applies to
 23 19 equity investments in a qualifying business made on or after
 23 20 that date.  Equity investments in a qualifying business or
 23 21 community=based seed capital fund made prior to the effective
 23 22 date of the division shall be governed by current law.
 23 23    DIVISION III ==== ENTREPRENEUR INVESTMENT AWARDS PROGRAM.
 23 24  Division III amends the entrepreneur investment awards program

 23 28 to conduct a comprehensive review of the program and submit

 23 33 assistance providers (provider) that provide technical and

 24 10 gross sales from markets outside Iowa; and must have engaged
 24 11 and communicated with certain other programs, funding sources,
 24 12 and entities for its entrepreneur clients.  The division
 24 13 amends the eligibility for receiving financial assistance to
 24 14 require that a provider have its principal place of operations
 24 15 in Iowa and that the provider offer a comprehensive set of

 24 21 location of the provider or the company and may be provided in
 24 22 consideration of equity participation in the company, a fee for

 24 24    Under current law, the EDA board could approve, deny, or
 24 25 defer each application for a grant, and was required to award
 24 26 grants on a first=come, first=served basis.  The division
 24 27 specifies that the EDA board has the discretion to approve,
 24 28 deny, or defer each application for financial assistance and
 24 29 that the amount of financial assistance awarded to a provider
 24 30 is within the discretion of the EDA.  The division requires
 24 31 the EDA to award financial assistance on a competitive basis
 24 32 and allows the EDA to develop scoring criteria and establish
 24 33 minimum requirements for the receipt of a financial assistance
 24 34 award.
 24 35    In addition to the four factors relating to the provider's
 25  1 professional staff that the EDA may consider under current
 25  2 law in deciding whether to award financial assistance, the
 25  3 division provides that the EDA may also consider the service
 25  4 model and likelihood of success of the provider, the provider's
 25  5 similarity to other successful providers in the country, and
 25  6 the provider's financial need.

 25  9 assistance program cannot exceed the lesser of 25 percent of
 25 10 the funds expended by the program during the previous fiscal
 25 11 year, 100 percent of the funds raised from certain persons
 25 12 by the program during the previous fiscal year, or $200,000.
 25 13 The division provides that the amount of financial assistance

 25 28    Under current law, an entrepreneurial assistance provider is

 23 23    DIVISION III ==== ENTREPRENEUR INVESTMENT AWARDS PROGRAM.
 23 24  Division III amends the entrepreneur investment awards program
 23 25 administered by the EDA.  The division strikes provisions that

 23 27 July 1, 2014, and that required the EDA by December 31, 2014,
 23 28 to conduct a comprehensive review of the program and submit

 23 31    The division modifies the purpose of the program to be

 23 33 assistance providers (provider) that provide technical and
 23 34 financial assistance to entrepreneurs and start=up companies

 24  1 "Financial assistance" is defined in the division.
 24  2    The division changes the requirements for receiving an

 24 15 in Iowa and that the provider offer a comprehensive set of
 24 16 business development services to emerging and early=stage
 24 17 innovation companies to assist in the creation, location,

 24 22 consideration of equity participation in the company, a fee for
 24 23 services, or a membership agreement with the company.
 24 24    Under current law, the EDA board could approve, deny, or
 24 25 defer each application for a grant, and was required to award
 24 26 grants on a first=come, first=served basis.  The division
 24 27 specifies that the EDA board has the discretion to approve,
 24 28 deny, or defer each application for financial assistance and
 24 29 that the amount of financial assistance awarded to a provider
 24 30 is within the discretion of the EDA.  The division requires
 24 31 the EDA to award financial assistance on a competitive basis
 24 32 and allows the EDA to develop scoring criteria and establish
 24 33 minimum requirements for the receipt of a financial assistance
 24 34 award.
 24 35    In addition to the four factors relating to the provider's
 25  1 professional staff that the EDA may consider under current
 25  2 law in deciding whether to award financial assistance, the
 25  3 division provides that the EDA may also consider the service
 25  4 model and likelihood of success of the provider, the provider's
 25  5 similarity to other successful providers in the country, and
 25  6 the provider's financial need.
 25  7    The division modifies the maximum award amount for a
 25  8 recipient.  Under current law, a grant to an entrepreneur
 25  9 assistance program cannot exceed the lesser of 25 percent of
 25 10 the funds expended by the program during the previous fiscal
 25 11 year, 100 percent of the funds raised from certain persons

 25 14 awarded to any one provider shall not exceed $200,000.
 25 15    The division modifies the permitted use of funds received
 25 16 under the program.  Under current law, grants are only

 25 18 incurred by the program.  The division specifies that financial
 25 19 assistance awarded to a provider shall only be used for
 25 20 the purpose of operating costs incurred by the provider in
 25 21 the provision of business development services to emerging
 25 22 and early=stage innovation companies in Iowa.  The division

 25 24 distributed to owners or investors of the company to which the
 25 25 business development services are being provided and shall not
 25 26 be provided to other persons assisting with the provision of
 25 27 the services.
 25 28    Under current law, an entrepreneurial assistance provider is
 25 29 required to accept client referrals from the EDA as a condition
 25 30 of receiving a grant.  The division provides that the EDA may
 25 31 make client referrals to eligible providers.
 25 32    DIVISION IV ==== MISCELLANEOUS CHANGES.  Division IV makes
 25 33 several miscellaneous changes to other EDA programs.  The
 25 34 division amends the sales and use tax refund available under
 25 35 the workforce housing tax incentive program.  That refund

 26  2 completion, which is currently defined to mean the first date
 26  3 upon which the average annualized production of finished
 26  4 product for the preceding 90=day period at the manufacturing
 26  5 facility operated by the eligible business is at least 50
 26  6 percent of the initial design capacity of the facility.  The
 26  7 division amends the definition of "project completion" to mean
 26  8 the date on which the EDA notifies the department of revenue

 26 13 entered into on or after that date.
 26 14    The division allows the EDA to extend the project

 23  9 qualifying business in which the investor made an equity
 23 10 investment, and the total number and amount of tax credits
 23 11 issued shall be considered public information under Code
 23 12 chapter 22 (examination of public records), but any other
 23 13 information or record in the possession of the EDA with respect
 23 14 to the program shall be presumed by the EDA to be a trade secret
 23 15 protected under Code chapter 550 or common law and shall be

 23 17 court.

 23 21 community=based seed capital fund made prior to the effective
 23 22 date of the division shall be governed by current law.
 23 23    DIVISION III ==== ENTREPRENEUR INVESTMENT AWARDS PROGRAM.
 23 24  Division III amends the entrepreneur investment awards program
 23 25 administered by the EDA.  The division strikes provisions that
 23 26 prohibited the EDA from making awards under the program since
 23 27 July 1, 2014, and that required the EDA by December 31, 2014,
 23 28 to conduct a comprehensive review of the program and submit
 23 29 a report with specified information to the governor and the
 23 30 general assembly.
 23 31    The division modifies the purpose of the program to be
 23 32 to provide financial assistance to eligible entrepreneurial
 23 33 assistance providers (provider) that provide technical and
 23 34 financial assistance to entrepreneurs and start=up companies
 23 35 seeking to create, locate, or expand a business in Iowa.
 24  1 "Financial assistance" is defined in the division.
 24  2    The division changes the requirements for receiving an
 24  3 award.  To be eligible to receive an award under current
 24  4 law, an entrepreneurial assistance program must have been
 24  5 an Iowa=based business, expended at least $500,000 during
 24  6 the previous fiscal year to provide technical and financial
 24  7 assistance services that meet the broad=based needs of

 24  9 in Iowa that intends to derive more than 10 percent of its
 24 10 gross sales from markets outside Iowa; and must have engaged
 24 11 and communicated with certain other programs, funding sources,
 24 12 and entities for its entrepreneur clients.  The division
 24 13 amends the eligibility for receiving financial assistance to
 24 14 require that a provider have its principal place of operations
 24 15 in Iowa and that the provider offer a comprehensive set of
 24 16 business development services to emerging and early=stage
 24 17 innovation companies to assist in the creation, location,
 24 18 growth, and long=term success of the company in Iowa.
 24 19 "Business development services" is defined in the division.
 24 20 Business development services may be performed at the physical
 24 21 location of the provider or the company and may be provided in
 24 22 consideration of equity participation in the company, a fee for
 24 23 services, or a membership agreement with the company.
 24 24    Under current law, the EDA board could approve, deny, or
 24 25 defer each application for a grant, and was required to award
 24 26 grants on a first=come, first=served basis.  The division
 24 27 specifies that the EDA board has the discretion to approve,
 24 28 deny, or defer each application for financial assistance and
 24 29 that the amount of financial assistance awarded to a provider
 24 30 is within the discretion of the EDA.  The division requires
 24 31 the EDA to award financial assistance on a competitive basis
 24 32 and allows the EDA to develop scoring criteria and establish
 24 33 minimum requirements for the receipt of a financial assistance
 24 34 award.
 24 35    In addition to the four factors relating to the provider's
 25  1 professional staff that the EDA may consider under current
 25  2 law in deciding whether to award financial assistance, the
 25  3 division provides that the EDA may also consider the service
 25  4 model and likelihood of success of the provider, the provider's
 25  5 similarity to other successful providers in the country, and
 25  6 the provider's financial need.
 25  7    The division modifies the maximum award amount for a
 25  8 recipient.  Under current law, a grant to an entrepreneur
 25  9 assistance program cannot exceed the lesser of 25 percent of
 25 10 the funds expended by the program during the previous fiscal
 25 11 year, 100 percent of the funds raised from certain persons
 25 12 by the program during the previous fiscal year, or $200,000.
 25 13 The division provides that the amount of financial assistance
 25 14 awarded to any one provider shall not exceed $200,000.
 25 15    The division modifies the permitted use of funds received
 25 16 under the program.  Under current law, grants are only
 25 17 permitted to be used for the purpose of operating costs
 25 18 incurred by the program.  The division specifies that financial
 25 19 assistance awarded to a provider shall only be used for
 25 20 the purpose of operating costs incurred by the provider in
 25 21 the provision of business development services to emerging
 25 22 and early=stage innovation companies in Iowa.  The division
 25 23 further requires that such financial assistance shall not be
 25 24 distributed to owners or investors of the company to which the
 25 25 business development services are being provided and shall not
 25 26 be provided to other persons assisting with the provision of
 25 27 the services.
 25 28    Under current law, an entrepreneurial assistance provider is
 25 29 required to accept client referrals from the EDA as a condition
 25 30 of receiving a grant.  The division provides that the EDA may
 25 31 make client referrals to eligible providers.
 25 32    DIVISION IV ==== MISCELLANEOUS CHANGES.  Division IV makes
 25 33 several miscellaneous changes to other EDA programs.  The
 25 34 division amends the sales and use tax refund available under
 25 35 the workforce housing tax incentive program.  That refund
 26  1 is available for sales and use tax paid prior to project
 26  2 completion, which is currently defined to mean the first date
 26  3 upon which the average annualized production of finished
 26  4 product for the preceding 90=day period at the manufacturing
 26  5 facility operated by the eligible business is at least 50
 26  6 percent of the initial design capacity of the facility.  The
 26  7 division amends the definition of "project completion" to mean
 26  8 the date on which the EDA notifies the department of revenue
 26  9 that all applicable requirements of a workforce housing tax
 26 10 incentive program agreement are satisfied.  This provision
 26 11 takes effect upon enactment and applies retroactively to July
 26 12 1, 2014, for all workforce housing tax incentive agreements
 26 13 entered into on or after that date.
 26 14    The division allows the EDA to extend the project
 26 15 completion date for a project awarded tax incentives under the
 26 16 redevelopment tax credit program and the housing enterprise
 26 17 zone tax incentives program if the property that is the subject
 26 18 of the project suffered a catastrophic fire during the 2014
 26 19 calendar year.

 22 34 two investors at the time of application for the tax credits.
 22 35 These modified eligibility requirements apply to businesses
 23  1 that submit an application to the EDA to be registered as a
 23  2 qualifying business on or after the effective date of this
 23  3 division of the bill, and businesses that submitted such an
 23  4 application to the EDA before the effective date of this
 23  5 division of the bill shall be governed by current law.
 23  6    The division provides for the confidentiality of certain
 23  7 information with regard to the tax credit.  The identity of
 23  8 a qualifying business, the identity of an investor and the
 23  9 qualifying business in which the investor made an equity
 23 10 investment, and the total number and amount of tax credits
 23 11 issued shall be considered public information under Code
 23 12 chapter 22 (examination of public records), but any other
 23 13 information or record in the possession of the EDA with respect
 23 14 to the program shall be presumed by the EDA to be a trade secret
 23 15 protected under Code chapter 550 or common law and shall be
 23 16 kept confidential by the EDA unless otherwise ordered by a
 23 17 court.
 23 18    The division takes effect upon enactment and applies to
 23 19 equity investments in a qualifying business made on or after
 23 20 that date.  Equity investments in a qualifying business or
 23 21 community=based seed capital fund made prior to the effective
 23 22 date of the division shall be governed by current law.
 23 23    DIVISION III ==== ENTREPRENEUR INVESTMENT AWARDS PROGRAM.
 23 24  Division III amends the entrepreneur investment awards program
 23 25 administered by the EDA.  The division strikes provisions that
 23 26 prohibited the EDA from making awards under the program since
 23 27 July 1, 2014, and that required the EDA by December 31, 2014,
 23 28 to conduct a comprehensive review of the program and submit
 23 29 a report with specified information to the governor and the
 23 30 general assembly.
 23 31    The division modifies the purpose of the program to be
 23 32 to provide financial assistance to eligible entrepreneurial
 23 33 assistance providers (provider) that provide technical and
 23 34 financial assistance to entrepreneurs and start=up companies
 23 35 seeking to create, locate, or expand a business in Iowa.
 24  1 "Financial assistance" is defined in the division.
 24  2    The division changes the requirements for receiving an
 24  3 award.  To be eligible to receive an award under current
 24  4 law, an entrepreneurial assistance program must have been
 24  5 an Iowa=based business, expended at least $500,000 during
 24  6 the previous fiscal year to provide technical and financial
 24  7 assistance services that meet the broad=based needs of
 24  8 entrepreneurs seeking to create, locate, or expand a business
 24  9 in Iowa that intends to derive more than 10 percent of its
 24 10 gross sales from markets outside Iowa; and must have engaged
 24 11 and communicated with certain other programs, funding sources,
 24 12 and entities for its entrepreneur clients.  The division
 24 13 amends the eligibility for receiving financial assistance to
 24 14 require that a provider have its principal place of operations
 24 15 in Iowa and that the provider offer a comprehensive set of
 24 16 business development services to emerging and early=stage
 24 17 innovation companies to assist in the creation, location,
 24 18 growth, and long=term success of the company in Iowa.
 24 19 "Business development services" is defined in the division.
 24 20 Business development services may be performed at the physical
 24 21 location of the provider or the company and may be provided in
 24 22 consideration of equity participation in the company, a fee for
 24 23 services, or a membership agreement with the company.
 24 24    Under current law, the EDA board could approve, deny, or
 24 25 defer each application for a grant, and was required to award
 24 26 grants on a first=come, first=served basis.  The division
 24 27 specifies that the EDA board has the discretion to approve,
 24 28 deny, or defer each application for financial assistance and
 24 29 that the amount of financial assistance awarded to a provider
 24 30 is within the discretion of the EDA.  The division requires
 24 31 the EDA to award financial assistance on a competitive basis
 24 32 and allows the EDA to develop scoring criteria and establish
 24 33 minimum requirements for the receipt of a financial assistance
 24 34 award.
 24 35    In addition to the four factors relating to the provider's
 25  1 professional staff that the EDA may consider under current
 25  2 law in deciding whether to award financial assistance, the
 25  3 division provides that the EDA may also consider the service
 25  4 model and likelihood of success of the provider, the provider's
 25  5 similarity to other successful providers in the country, and
 25  6 the provider's financial need.
 25  7    The division modifies the maximum award amount for a
 25  8 recipient.  Under current law, a grant to an entrepreneur
 25  9 assistance program cannot exceed the lesser of 25 percent of
 25 10 the funds expended by the program during the previous fiscal
 25 11 year, 100 percent of the funds raised from certain persons
 25 12 by the program during the previous fiscal year, or $200,000.
 25 13 The division provides that the amount of financial assistance
 25 14 awarded to any one provider shall not exceed $200,000.
 25 15    The division modifies the permitted use of funds received
 25 16 under the program.  Under current law, grants are only
 25 17 permitted to be used for the purpose of operating costs
 25 18 incurred by the program.  The division specifies that financial
 25 19 assistance awarded to a provider shall only be used for
 25 20 the purpose of operating costs incurred by the provider in
 25 21 the provision of business development services to emerging
 25 22 and early=stage innovation companies in Iowa.  The division
 25 23 further requires that such financial assistance shall not be
 25 24 distributed to owners or investors of the company to which the
 25 25 business development services are being provided and shall not
 25 26 be provided to other persons assisting with the provision of
 25 27 the services.
 25 28    Under current law, an entrepreneurial assistance provider is
 25 29 required to accept client referrals from the EDA as a condition
 25 30 of receiving a grant.  The division provides that the EDA may
 25 31 make client referrals to eligible providers.
 25 32    DIVISION IV ==== MISCELLANEOUS CHANGES.  Division IV makes
 25 33 several miscellaneous changes to other EDA programs.  The
 25 34 division amends the sales and use tax refund available under
 25 35 the workforce housing tax incentive program.  That refund
 26  1 is available for sales and use tax paid prior to project
 26  2 completion, which is currently defined to mean the first date
 26  3 upon which the average annualized production of finished
 26  4 product for the preceding 90=day period at the manufacturing
 26  5 facility operated by the eligible business is at least 50
 26  6 percent of the initial design capacity of the facility.  The
 26  7 division amends the definition of "project completion" to mean
 26  8 the date on which the EDA notifies the department of revenue
 26  9 that all applicable requirements of a workforce housing tax
 26 10 incentive program agreement are satisfied.  This provision
 26 11 takes effect upon enactment and applies retroactively to July
 26 12 1, 2014, for all workforce housing tax incentive agreements
 26 13 entered into on or after that date.
 26 14    The division allows the EDA to extend the project
 26 15 completion date for a project awarded tax incentives under the
 26 16 redevelopment tax credit program and the housing enterprise
 26 17 zone tax incentives program if the property that is the subject
 26 18 of the project suffered a catastrophic fire during the 2014
 26 19 calendar year.

       mm/sc
 22 35 These modified eligibility requirements apply to businesses
 23  1 that submit an application to the EDA to be registered as a

 23  3 division of the bill, and businesses that submitted such an

 23  5 division of the bill shall be governed by current law.
 23  6    The division provides for the confidentiality of certain
 23  7 information with regard to the tax credit.  The identity of

 23 10 investment, and the total number and amount of tax credits
 23 11 issued shall be considered public information under Code
 23 12 chapter 22 (examination of public records), but any other
 23 13 information or record in the possession of the EDA with respect
 23 14 to the program shall be presumed by the EDA to be a trade secret
 23 15 protected under Code chapter 550 or common law and shall be

 23 21 community=based seed capital fund made prior to the effective
 23 22 date of the division shall be governed by current law.
 23 23    DIVISION III ==== ENTREPRENEUR INVESTMENT AWARDS PROGRAM.
 23 24  Division III amends the entrepreneur investment awards program
 23 25 administered by the EDA.  The division strikes provisions that
 23 26 prohibited the EDA from making awards under the program since
 23 27 July 1, 2014, and that required the EDA by December 31, 2014,
 23 28 to conduct a comprehensive review of the program and submit
 23 29 a report with specified information to the governor and the
 23 30 general assembly.
 23 31    The division modifies the purpose of the program to be
 23 32 to provide financial assistance to eligible entrepreneurial
 23 33 assistance providers (provider) that provide technical and
 23 34 financial assistance to entrepreneurs and start=up companies
 23 35 seeking to create, locate, or expand a business in Iowa.
 24  1 "Financial assistance" is defined in the division.
 24  2    The division changes the requirements for receiving an
 24  3 award.  To be eligible to receive an award under current
 24  4 law, an entrepreneurial assistance program must have been
 24  5 an Iowa=based business, expended at least $500,000 during
 24  6 the previous fiscal year to provide technical and financial
 24  7 assistance services that meet the broad=based needs of
 24  8 entrepreneurs seeking to create, locate, or expand a business
 24  9 in Iowa that intends to derive more than 10 percent of its
 24 10 gross sales from markets outside Iowa; and must have engaged
 24 11 and communicated with certain other programs, funding sources,
 24 12 and entities for its entrepreneur clients.  The division
 24 13 amends the eligibility for receiving financial assistance to
 24 14 require that a provider have its principal place of operations
 24 15 in Iowa and that the provider offer a comprehensive set of
 24 16 business development services to emerging and early=stage
 24 17 innovation companies to assist in the creation, location,
 24 18 growth, and long=term success of the company in Iowa.
 24 19 "Business development services" is defined in the division.
 24 20 Business development services may be performed at the physical
 24 21 location of the provider or the company and may be provided in
 24 22 consideration of equity participation in the company, a fee for
 24 23 services, or a membership agreement with the company.
 24 24    Under current law, the EDA board could approve, deny, or
 24 25 defer each application for a grant, and was required to award
 24 26 grants on a first=come, first=served basis.  The division
 24 27 specifies that the EDA board has the discretion to approve,
 24 28 deny, or defer each application for financial assistance and
 24 29 that the amount of financial assistance awarded to a provider
 24 30 is within the discretion of the EDA.  The division requires
 24 31 the EDA to award financial assistance on a competitive basis
 24 32 and allows the EDA to develop scoring criteria and establish
 24 33 minimum requirements for the receipt of a financial assistance
 24 34 award.
 24 35    In addition to the four factors relating to the provider's
 25  1 professional staff that the EDA may consider under current
 25  2 law in deciding whether to award financial assistance, the
 25  3 division provides that the EDA may also consider the service
 25  4 model and likelihood of success of the provider, the provider's
 25  5 similarity to other successful providers in the country, and
 25  6 the provider's financial need.
 25  7    The division modifies the maximum award amount for a
 25  8 recipient.  Under current law, a grant to an entrepreneur
 25  9 assistance program cannot exceed the lesser of 25 percent of
 25 10 the funds expended by the program during the previous fiscal
 25 11 year, 100 percent of the funds raised from certain persons

 25 13 The division provides that the amount of financial assistance
 25 14 awarded to any one provider shall not exceed $200,000.
 25 15    The division modifies the permitted use of funds received
 25 16 under the program.  Under current law, grants are only
 25 17 permitted to be used for the purpose of operating costs
 25 18 incurred by the program.  The division specifies that financial
 25 19 assistance awarded to a provider shall only be used for
 25 20 the purpose of operating costs incurred by the provider in
 25 21 the provision of business development services to emerging
 25 22 and early=stage innovation companies in Iowa.  The division
 25 23 further requires that such financial assistance shall not be
 25 24 distributed to owners or investors of the company to which the
 25 25 business development services are being provided and shall not
 25 26 be provided to other persons assisting with the provision of
 25 27 the services.
 25 28    Under current law, an entrepreneurial assistance provider is
 25 29 required to accept client referrals from the EDA as a condition
 25 30 of receiving a grant.  The division provides that the EDA may
 25 31 make client referrals to eligible providers.
 25 32    DIVISION IV ==== MISCELLANEOUS CHANGES.  Division IV makes
 25 33 several miscellaneous changes to other EDA programs.  The
 25 34 division amends the sales and use tax refund available under
 25 35 the workforce housing tax incentive program.  That refund
 26  1 is available for sales and use tax paid prior to project
 26  2 completion, which is currently defined to mean the first date
 26  3 upon which the average annualized production of finished
 26  4 product for the preceding 90=day period at the manufacturing
 26  5 facility operated by the eligible business is at least 50
 26  6 percent of the initial design capacity of the facility.  The
 26  7 division amends the definition of "project completion" to mean
 26  8 the date on which the EDA notifies the department of revenue
 26  9 that all applicable requirements of a workforce housing tax
 26 10 incentive program agreement are satisfied.  This provision
 26 11 takes effect upon enactment and applies retroactively to July
 26 12 1, 2014, for all workforce housing tax incentive agreements
 26 13 entered into on or after that date.
 26 14    The division allows the EDA to extend the project
 26 15 completion date for a project awarded tax incentives under the
 26 16 redevelopment tax credit program and the housing enterprise
 26 17 zone tax incentives program if the property that is the subject
 26 18 of the project suffered a catastrophic fire during the 2014

 23 10 investment, and the total number and amount of tax credits
 23 11 issued shall be considered public information under Code

 23 22 date of the division shall be governed by current law.
 23 23    DIVISION III ==== ENTREPRENEUR INVESTMENT AWARDS PROGRAM.
 23 24  Division III amends the entrepreneur investment awards program
 23 25 administered by the EDA.  The division strikes provisions that
 23 26 prohibited the EDA from making awards under the program since
 23 27 July 1, 2014, and that required the EDA by December 31, 2014,
 23 28 to conduct a comprehensive review of the program and submit
 23 29 a report with specified information to the governor and the
 23 30 general assembly.
 23 31    The division modifies the purpose of the program to be
 23 32 to provide financial assistance to eligible entrepreneurial
 23 33 assistance providers (provider) that provide technical and
 23 34 financial assistance to entrepreneurs and start=up companies
 23 35 seeking to create, locate, or expand a business in Iowa.
 24  1 "Financial assistance" is defined in the division.
 24  2    The division changes the requirements for receiving an
 24  3 award.  To be eligible to receive an award under current
 24  4 law, an entrepreneurial assistance program must have been
 24  5 an Iowa=based business, expended at least $500,000 during
 24  6 the previous fiscal year to provide technical and financial
 24  7 assistance services that meet the broad=based needs of
 24  8 entrepreneurs seeking to create, locate, or expand a business
 24  9 in Iowa that intends to derive more than 10 percent of its
 24 10 gross sales from markets outside Iowa; and must have engaged
 24 11 and communicated with certain other programs, funding sources,
 24 12 and entities for its entrepreneur clients.  The division
 24 13 amends the eligibility for receiving financial assistance to
 24 14 require that a provider have its principal place of operations
 24 15 in Iowa and that the provider offer a comprehensive set of
 24 16 business development services to emerging and early=stage
 24 17 innovation companies to assist in the creation, location,
 24 18 growth, and long=term success of the company in Iowa.
 24 19 "Business development services" is defined in the division.
 24 20 Business development services may be performed at the physical
 24 21 location of the provider or the company and may be provided in
 24 22 consideration of equity participation in the company, a fee for
 24 23 services, or a membership agreement with the company.
 24 24    Under current law, the EDA board could approve, deny, or
 24 25 defer each application for a grant, and was required to award
 24 26 grants on a first=come, first=served basis.  The division
 24 27 specifies that the EDA board has the discretion to approve,
 24 28 deny, or defer each application for financial assistance and
 24 29 that the amount of financial assistance awarded to a provider
 24 30 is within the discretion of the EDA.  The division requires
 24 31 the EDA to award financial assistance on a competitive basis
 24 32 and allows the EDA to develop scoring criteria and establish
 24 33 minimum requirements for the receipt of a financial assistance
 24 34 award.
 24 35    In addition to the four factors relating to the provider's
 25  1 professional staff that the EDA may consider under current
 25  2 law in deciding whether to award financial assistance, the
 25  3 division provides that the EDA may also consider the service
 25  4 model and likelihood of success of the provider, the provider's
 25  5 similarity to other successful providers in the country, and
 25  6 the provider's financial need.
 25  7    The division modifies the maximum award amount for a
 25  8 recipient.  Under current law, a grant to an entrepreneur
 25  9 assistance program cannot exceed the lesser of 25 percent of
 25 10 the funds expended by the program during the previous fiscal
 25 11 year, 100 percent of the funds raised from certain persons
 25 12 by the program during the previous fiscal year, or $200,000.
 25 13 The division provides that the amount of financial assistance
 25 14 awarded to any one provider shall not exceed $200,000.
 25 15    The division modifies the permitted use of funds received
 25 16 under the program.  Under current law, grants are only
 25 17 permitted to be used for the purpose of operating costs
 25 18 incurred by the program.  The division specifies that financial
 25 19 assistance awarded to a provider shall only be used for
 25 20 the purpose of operating costs incurred by the provider in
 25 21 the provision of business development services to emerging
 25 22 and early=stage innovation companies in Iowa.  The division
 25 23 further requires that such financial assistance shall not be
 25 24 distributed to owners or investors of the company to which the
 25 25 business development services are being provided and shall not
 25 26 be provided to other persons assisting with the provision of
 25 27 the services.
 25 28    Under current law, an entrepreneurial assistance provider is
 25 29 required to accept client referrals from the EDA as a condition
 25 30 of receiving a grant.  The division provides that the EDA may
 25 31 make client referrals to eligible providers.
 25 32    DIVISION IV ==== MISCELLANEOUS CHANGES.  Division IV makes
 25 33 several miscellaneous changes to other EDA programs.  The
 25 34 division amends the sales and use tax refund available under
 25 35 the workforce housing tax incentive program.  That refund
 26  1 is available for sales and use tax paid prior to project
 26  2 completion, which is currently defined to mean the first date
 26  3 upon which the average annualized production of finished
 26  4 product for the preceding 90=day period at the manufacturing
 26  5 facility operated by the eligible business is at least 50
 26  6 percent of the initial design capacity of the facility.  The
 26  7 division amends the definition of "project completion" to mean
 26  8 the date on which the EDA notifies the department of revenue
 26  9 that all applicable requirements of a workforce housing tax
 26 10 incentive program agreement are satisfied.  This provision
 26 11 takes effect upon enactment and applies retroactively to July
 26 12 1, 2014, for all workforce housing tax incentive agreements
 26 13 entered into on or after that date.
 26 14    The division allows the EDA to extend the project
 26 15 completion date for a project awarded tax incentives under the
 26 16 redevelopment tax credit program and the housing enterprise
 26 17 zone tax incentives program if the property that is the subject
 26 18 of the project suffered a catastrophic fire during the 2014
 26 19 calendar year.

 23  3 division of the bill, and businesses that submitted such an
 23  4 application to the EDA before the effective date of this
 23  5 division of the bill shall be governed by current law.
 23  6    The division provides for the confidentiality of certain
 23  7 information with regard to the tax credit.  The identity of
 23  8 a qualifying business, the identity of an investor and the
 23  9 qualifying business in which the investor made an equity
 23 10 investment, and the total number and amount of tax credits
 23 11 issued shall be considered public information under Code
 23 12 chapter 22 (examination of public records), but any other
 23 13 information or record in the possession of the EDA with respect
 23 14 to the program shall be presumed by the EDA to be a trade secret
 23 15 protected under Code chapter 550 or common law and shall be
 23 16 kept confidential by the EDA unless otherwise ordered by a
 23 17 court.
 23 18    The division takes effect upon enactment and applies to
 23 19 equity investments in a qualifying business made on or after
 23 20 that date.  Equity investments in a qualifying business or
 23 21 community=based seed capital fund made prior to the effective
 23 22 date of the division shall be governed by current law.
 23 23    DIVISION III ==== ENTREPRENEUR INVESTMENT AWARDS PROGRAM.
 23 24  Division III amends the entrepreneur investment awards program
 23 25 administered by the EDA.  The division strikes provisions that
 23 26 prohibited the EDA from making awards under the program since
 23 27 July 1, 2014, and that required the EDA by December 31, 2014,
 23 28 to conduct a comprehensive review of the program and submit
 23 29 a report with specified information to the governor and the
 23 30 general assembly.
 23 31    The division modifies the purpose of the program to be
 23 32 to provide financial assistance to eligible entrepreneurial
 23 33 assistance providers (provider) that provide technical and
 23 34 financial assistance to entrepreneurs and start=up companies
 23 35 seeking to create, locate, or expand a business in Iowa.
 24  1 "Financial assistance" is defined in the division.
 24  2    The division changes the requirements for receiving an
 24  3 award.  To be eligible to receive an award under current
 24  4 law, an entrepreneurial assistance program must have been
 24  5 an Iowa=based business, expended at least $500,000 during
 24  6 the previous fiscal year to provide technical and financial
 24  7 assistance services that meet the broad=based needs of
 24  8 entrepreneurs seeking to create, locate, or expand a business
 24  9 in Iowa that intends to derive more than 10 percent of its
 24 10 gross sales from markets outside Iowa; and must have engaged
 24 11 and communicated with certain other programs, funding sources,
 24 12 and entities for its entrepreneur clients.  The division
 24 13 amends the eligibility for receiving financial assistance to
 24 14 require that a provider have its principal place of operations
 24 15 in Iowa and that the provider offer a comprehensive set of
 24 16 business development services to emerging and early=stage
 24 17 innovation companies to assist in the creation, location,
 24 18 growth, and long=term success of the company in Iowa.
 24 19 "Business development services" is defined in the division.
 24 20 Business development services may be performed at the physical
 24 21 location of the provider or the company and may be provided in
 24 22 consideration of equity participation in the company, a fee for
 24 23 services, or a membership agreement with the company.
 24 24    Under current law, the EDA board could approve, deny, or
 24 25 defer each application for a grant, and was required to award
 24 26 grants on a first=come, first=served basis.  The division
 24 27 specifies that the EDA board has the discretion to approve,
 24 28 deny, or defer each application for financial assistance and
 24 29 that the amount of financial assistance awarded to a provider
 24 30 is within the discretion of the EDA.  The division requires
 24 31 the EDA to award financial assistance on a competitive basis
 24 32 and allows the EDA to develop scoring criteria and establish
 24 33 minimum requirements for the receipt of a financial assistance
 24 34 award.
 24 35    In addition to the four factors relating to the provider's
 25  1 professional staff that the EDA may consider under current
 25  2 law in deciding whether to award financial assistance, the
 25  3 division provides that the EDA may also consider the service
 25  4 model and likelihood of success of the provider, the provider's
 25  5 similarity to other successful providers in the country, and
 25  6 the provider's financial need.
 25  7    The division modifies the maximum award amount for a
 25  8 recipient.  Under current law, a grant to an entrepreneur
 25  9 assistance program cannot exceed the lesser of 25 percent of
 25 10 the funds expended by the program during the previous fiscal
 25 11 year, 100 percent of the funds raised from certain persons
 25 12 by the program during the previous fiscal year, or $200,000.
 25 13 The division provides that the amount of financial assistance
 25 14 awarded to any one provider shall not exceed $200,000.
 25 15    The division modifies the permitted use of funds received
 25 16 under the program.  Under current law, grants are only
 25 17 permitted to be used for the purpose of operating costs
 25 18 incurred by the program.  The division specifies that financial
 25 19 assistance awarded to a provider shall only be used for
 25 20 the purpose of operating costs incurred by the provider in
 25 21 the provision of business development services to emerging
 25 22 and early=stage innovation companies in Iowa.  The division
 25 23 further requires that such financial assistance shall not be
 25 24 distributed to owners or investors of the company to which the
 25 25 business development services are being provided and shall not
 25 26 be provided to other persons assisting with the provision of
 25 27 the services.
 25 28    Under current law, an entrepreneurial assistance provider is
 25 29 required to accept client referrals from the EDA as a condition
 25 30 of receiving a grant.  The division provides that the EDA may
 25 31 make client referrals to eligible providers.
 25 32    DIVISION IV ==== MISCELLANEOUS CHANGES.  Division IV makes
 25 33 several miscellaneous changes to other EDA programs.  The
 25 34 division amends the sales and use tax refund available under
 25 35 the workforce housing tax incentive program.  That refund
 26  1 is available for sales and use tax paid prior to project
 26  2 completion, which is currently defined to mean the first date
 26  3 upon which the average annualized production of finished
 26  4 product for the preceding 90=day period at the manufacturing
 26  5 facility operated by the eligible business is at least 50
 26  6 percent of the initial design capacity of the facility.  The
 26  7 division amends the definition of "project completion" to mean
 26  8 the date on which the EDA notifies the department of revenue
 26  9 that all applicable requirements of a workforce housing tax
 26 10 incentive program agreement are satisfied.  This provision
 26 11 takes effect upon enactment and applies retroactively to July
 26 12 1, 2014, for all workforce housing tax incentive agreements
 26 13 entered into on or after that date.
 26 14    The division allows the EDA to extend the project
 26 15 completion date for a project awarded tax incentives under the
 26 16 redevelopment tax credit program and the housing enterprise
 26 17 zone tax incentives program if the property that is the subject
 26 18 of the project suffered a catastrophic fire during the 2014
 26 19 calendar year.

 23  3 division of the bill, and businesses that submitted such an
 23  4 application to the EDA before the effective date of this
 23  5 division of the bill shall be governed by current law.
 23  6    The division provides for the confidentiality of certain
 23  7 information with regard to the tax credit.  The identity of
 23  8 a qualifying business, the identity of an investor and the
 23  9 qualifying business in which the investor made an equity
 23 10 investment, and the total number and amount of tax credits
 23 11 issued shall be considered public information under Code
 23 12 chapter 22 (examination of public records), but any other
 23 13 information or record in the possession of the EDA with respect
 23 14 to the program shall be presumed by the EDA to be a trade secret
 23 15 protected under Code chapter 550 or common law and shall be
 23 16 kept confidential by the EDA unless otherwise ordered by a
 23 17 court.
 23 18    The division takes effect upon enactment and applies to
 23 19 equity investments in a qualifying business made on or after
 23 20 that date.  Equity investments in a qualifying business or
 23 21 community=based seed capital fund made prior to the effective
 23 22 date of the division shall be governed by current law.
 23 23    DIVISION III ==== ENTREPRENEUR INVESTMENT AWARDS PROGRAM.
 23 24  Division III amends the entrepreneur investment awards program
 23 25 administered by the EDA.  The division strikes provisions that
 23 26 prohibited the EDA from making awards under the program since
 23 27 July 1, 2014, and that required the EDA by December 31, 2014,
 23 28 to conduct a comprehensive review of the program and submit
 23 29 a report with specified information to the governor and the
 23 30 general assembly.
 23 31    The division modifies the purpose of the program to be
 23 32 to provide financial assistance to eligible entrepreneurial
 23 33 assistance providers (provider) that provide technical and
 23 34 financial assistance to entrepreneurs and start=up companies
 23 35 seeking to create, locate, or expand a business in Iowa.
 24  1 "Financial assistance" is defined in the division.
 24  2    The division changes the requirements for receiving an
 24  3 award.  To be eligible to receive an award under current
 24  4 law, an entrepreneurial assistance program must have been
 24  5 an Iowa=based business, expended at least $500,000 during
 24  6 the previous fiscal year to provide technical and financial
 24  7 assistance services that meet the broad=based needs of
 24  8 entrepreneurs seeking to create, locate, or expand a business
 24  9 in Iowa that intends to derive more than 10 percent of its
 24 10 gross sales from markets outside Iowa; and must have engaged
 24 11 and communicated with certain other programs, funding sources,
 24 12 and entities for its entrepreneur clients.  The division
 24 13 amends the eligibility for receiving financial assistance to
 24 14 require that a provider have its principal place of operations
 24 15 in Iowa and that the provider offer a comprehensive set of
 24 16 business development services to emerging and early=stage
 24 17 innovation companies to assist in the creation, location,
 24 18 growth, and long=term success of the company in Iowa.
 24 19 "Business development services" is defined in the division.
 24 20 Business development services may be performed at the physical
 24 21 location of the provider or the company and may be provided in
 24 22 consideration of equity participation in the company, a fee for
 24 23 services, or a membership agreement with the company.
 24 24    Under current law, the EDA board could approve, deny, or
 24 25 defer each application for a grant, and was required to award
 24 26 grants on a first=come, first=served basis.  The division
 24 27 specifies that the EDA board has the discretion to approve,
 24 28 deny, or defer each application for financial assistance and
 24 29 that the amount of financial assistance awarded to a provider
 24 30 is within the discretion of the EDA.  The division requires
 24 31 the EDA to award financial assistance on a competitive basis
 24 32 and allows the EDA to develop scoring criteria and establish
 24 33 minimum requirements for the receipt of a financial assistance
 24 34 award.
 24 35    In addition to the four factors relating to the provider's
 25  1 professional staff that the EDA may consider under current
 25  2 law in deciding whether to award financial assistance, the
 25  3 division provides that the EDA may also consider the service
 25  4 model and likelihood of success of the provider, the provider's
 25  5 similarity to other successful providers in the country, and
 25  6 the provider's financial need.
 25  7    The division modifies the maximum award amount for a
 25  8 recipient.  Under current law, a grant to an entrepreneur
 25  9 assistance program cannot exceed the lesser of 25 percent of
 25 10 the funds expended by the program during the previous fiscal
 25 11 year, 100 percent of the funds raised from certain persons
 25 12 by the program during the previous fiscal year, or $200,000.
 25 13 The division provides that the amount of financial assistance
 25 14 awarded to any one provider shall not exceed $200,000.
 25 15    The division modifies the permitted use of funds received
 25 16 under the program.  Under current law, grants are only
 25 17 permitted to be used for the purpose of operating costs
 25 18 incurred by the program.  The division specifies that financial
 25 19 assistance awarded to a provider shall only be used for
 25 20 the purpose of operating costs incurred by the provider in
 25 21 the provision of business development services to emerging
 25 22 and early=stage innovation companies in Iowa.  The division
 25 23 further requires that such financial assistance shall not be
 25 24 distributed to owners or investors of the company to which the
 25 25 business development services are being provided and shall not
 25 26 be provided to other persons assisting with the provision of
 25 27 the services.
 25 28    Under current law, an entrepreneurial assistance provider is
 25 29 required to accept client referrals from the EDA as a condition
 25 30 of receiving a grant.  The division provides that the EDA may
 25 31 make client referrals to eligible providers.
 25 32    DIVISION IV ==== MISCELLANEOUS CHANGES.  Division IV makes
 25 33 several miscellaneous changes to other EDA programs.  The
 25 34 division amends the sales and use tax refund available under
 25 35 the workforce housing tax incentive program.  That refund
 26  1 is available for sales and use tax paid prior to project
 26  2 completion, which is currently defined to mean the first date
 26  3 upon which the average annualized production of finished
 26  4 product for the preceding 90=day period at the manufacturing
 26  5 facility operated by the eligible business is at least 50
 26  6 percent of the initial design capacity of the facility.  The
 26  7 division amends the definition of "project completion" to mean
 26  8 the date on which the EDA notifies the department of revenue
 26  9 that all applicable requirements of a workforce housing tax
 26 10 incentive program agreement are satisfied.  This provision
 26 11 takes effect upon enactment and applies retroactively to July
 26 12 1, 2014, for all workforce housing tax incentive agreements
 26 13 entered into on or after that date.
 26 14    The division allows the EDA to extend the project
 26 15 completion date for a project awarded tax incentives under the
 26 16 redevelopment tax credit program and the housing enterprise
 26 17 zone tax incentives program if the property that is the subject
 26 18 of the project suffered a catastrophic fire during the 2014
 26 19 calendar year.

 23  8 a qualifying business, the identity of an investor and the
 23  9 qualifying business in which the investor made an equity
 23 10 investment, and the total number and amount of tax credits
 23 11 issued shall be considered public information under Code
 23 12 chapter 22 (examination of public records), but any other
 23 13 information or record in the possession of the EDA with respect
 23 14 to the program shall be presumed by the EDA to be a trade secret
 23 15 protected under Code chapter 550 or common law and shall be
 23 16 kept confidential by the EDA unless otherwise ordered by a
 23 17 court.
 23 18    The division takes effect upon enactment and applies to
 23 19 equity investments in a qualifying business made on or after

 23 21 community=based seed capital fund made prior to the effective
 23 22 date of the division shall be governed by current law.
 23 23    DIVISION III ==== ENTREPRENEUR INVESTMENT AWARDS PROGRAM.
 23 24  Division III amends the entrepreneur investment awards program
 23 25 administered by the EDA.  The division strikes provisions that
 23 26 prohibited the EDA from making awards under the program since
 23 27 July 1, 2014, and that required the EDA by December 31, 2014,
 23 28 to conduct a comprehensive review of the program and submit
 23 29 a report with specified information to the governor and the
 23 30 general assembly.
 23 31    The division modifies the purpose of the program to be
 23 32 to provide financial assistance to eligible entrepreneurial
 23 33 assistance providers (provider) that provide technical and
 23 34 financial assistance to entrepreneurs and start=up companies
 23 35 seeking to create, locate, or expand a business in Iowa.
 24  1 "Financial assistance" is defined in the division.
 24  2    The division changes the requirements for receiving an
 24  3 award.  To be eligible to receive an award under current
 24  4 law, an entrepreneurial assistance program must have been
 24  5 an Iowa=based business, expended at least $500,000 during
 24  6 the previous fiscal year to provide technical and financial
 24  7 assistance services that meet the broad=based needs of
 24  8 entrepreneurs seeking to create, locate, or expand a business
 24  9 in Iowa that intends to derive more than 10 percent of its
 24 10 gross sales from markets outside Iowa; and must have engaged
 24 11 and communicated with certain other programs, funding sources,
 24 12 and entities for its entrepreneur clients.  The division
 24 13 amends the eligibility for receiving financial assistance to
 24 14 require that a provider have its principal place of operations
 24 15 in Iowa and that the provider offer a comprehensive set of
 24 16 business development services to emerging and early=stage
 24 17 innovation companies to assist in the creation, location,
 24 18 growth, and long=term success of the company in Iowa.
 24 19 "Business development services" is defined in the division.
 24 20 Business development services may be performed at the physical
 24 21 location of the provider or the company and may be provided in
 24 22 consideration of equity participation in the company, a fee for
 24 23 services, or a membership agreement with the company.
 24 24    Under current law, the EDA board could approve, deny, or
 24 25 defer each application for a grant, and was required to award
 24 26 grants on a first=come, first=served basis.  The division
 24 27 specifies that the EDA board has the discretion to approve,
 24 28 deny, or defer each application for financial assistance and
 24 29 that the amount of financial assistance awarded to a provider
 24 30 is within the discretion of the EDA.  The division requires
 24 31 the EDA to award financial assistance on a competitive basis
 24 32 and allows the EDA to develop scoring criteria and establish
 24 33 minimum requirements for the receipt of a financial assistance
 24 34 award.
 24 35    In addition to the four factors relating to the provider's
 25  1 professional staff that the EDA may consider under current
 25  2 law in deciding whether to award financial assistance, the
 25  3 division provides that the EDA may also consider the service
 25  4 model and likelihood of success of the provider, the provider's
 25  5 similarity to other successful providers in the country, and
 25  6 the provider's financial need.
 25  7    The division modifies the maximum award amount for a
 25  8 recipient.  Under current law, a grant to an entrepreneur
 25  9 assistance program cannot exceed the lesser of 25 percent of
 25 10 the funds expended by the program during the previous fiscal
 25 11 year, 100 percent of the funds raised from certain persons
 25 12 by the program during the previous fiscal year, or $200,000.
 25 13 The division provides that the amount of financial assistance
 25 14 awarded to any one provider shall not exceed $200,000.
 25 15    The division modifies the permitted use of funds received
 25 16 under the program.  Under current law, grants are only
 25 17 permitted to be used for the purpose of operating costs
 25 18 incurred by the program.  The division specifies that financial
 25 19 assistance awarded to a provider shall only be used for
 25 20 the purpose of operating costs incurred by the provider in
 25 21 the provision of business development services to emerging
 25 22 and early=stage innovation companies in Iowa.  The division
 25 23 further requires that such financial assistance shall not be
 25 24 distributed to owners or investors of the company to which the
 25 25 business development services are being provided and shall not
 25 26 be provided to other persons assisting with the provision of
 25 27 the services.
 25 28    Under current law, an entrepreneurial assistance provider is
 25 29 required to accept client referrals from the EDA as a condition
 25 30 of receiving a grant.  The division provides that the EDA may
 25 31 make client referrals to eligible providers.
 25 32    DIVISION IV ==== MISCELLANEOUS CHANGES.  Division IV makes
 25 33 several miscellaneous changes to other EDA programs.  The
 25 34 division amends the sales and use tax refund available under
 25 35 the workforce housing tax incentive program.  That refund
 26  1 is available for sales and use tax paid prior to project
 26  2 completion, which is currently defined to mean the first date
 26  3 upon which the average annualized production of finished
 26  4 product for the preceding 90=day period at the manufacturing
 26  5 facility operated by the eligible business is at least 50
 26  6 percent of the initial design capacity of the facility.  The
 26  7 division amends the definition of "project completion" to mean
 26  8 the date on which the EDA notifies the department of revenue
 26  9 that all applicable requirements of a workforce housing tax
 26 10 incentive program agreement are satisfied.  This provision
 26 11 takes effect upon enactment and applies retroactively to July
 26 12 1, 2014, for all workforce housing tax incentive agreements
 26 13 entered into on or after that date.
 26 14    The division allows the EDA to extend the project
 26 15 completion date for a project awarded tax incentives under the
 26 16 redevelopment tax credit program and the housing enterprise
 26 17 zone tax incentives program if the property that is the subject

 23 10 investment, and the total number and amount of tax credits
 23 11 issued shall be considered public information under Code

 23 21 community=based seed capital fund made prior to the effective
 23 22 date of the division shall be governed by current law.
 23 23    DIVISION III ==== ENTREPRENEUR INVESTMENT AWARDS PROGRAM.
 23 24  Division III amends the entrepreneur investment awards program
 23 25 administered by the EDA.  The division strikes provisions that
 23 26 prohibited the EDA from making awards under the program since
 23 27 July 1, 2014, and that required the EDA by December 31, 2014,
 23 28 to conduct a comprehensive review of the program and submit
 23 29 a report with specified information to the governor and the
 23 30 general assembly.
 23 31    The division modifies the purpose of the program to be
 23 32 to provide financial assistance to eligible entrepreneurial
 23 33 assistance providers (provider) that provide technical and
 23 34 financial assistance to entrepreneurs and start=up companies
 23 35 seeking to create, locate, or expand a business in Iowa.
 24  1 "Financial assistance" is defined in the division.
 24  2    The division changes the requirements for receiving an

 24  4 law, an entrepreneurial assistance program must have been
 24  5 an Iowa=based business, expended at least $500,000 during
 24  6 the previous fiscal year to provide technical and financial
 24  7 assistance services that meet the broad=based needs of
 24  8 entrepreneurs seeking to create, locate, or expand a business
 24  9 in Iowa that intends to derive more than 10 percent of its
 24 10 gross sales from markets outside Iowa; and must have engaged
 24 11 and communicated with certain other programs, funding sources,
 24 12 and entities for its entrepreneur clients.  The division
 24 13 amends the eligibility for receiving financial assistance to
 24 14 require that a provider have its principal place of operations
 24 15 in Iowa and that the provider offer a comprehensive set of
 24 16 business development services to emerging and early=stage
 24 17 innovation companies to assist in the creation, location,
 24 18 growth, and long=term success of the company in Iowa.
 24 19 "Business development services" is defined in the division.
 24 20 Business development services may be performed at the physical
 24 21 location of the provider or the company and may be provided in
 24 22 consideration of equity participation in the company, a fee for
 24 23 services, or a membership agreement with the company.
 24 24    Under current law, the EDA board could approve, deny, or
 24 25 defer each application for a grant, and was required to award
 24 26 grants on a first=come, first=served basis.  The division
 24 27 specifies that the EDA board has the discretion to approve,
 24 28 deny, or defer each application for financial assistance and
 24 29 that the amount of financial assistance awarded to a provider
 24 30 is within the discretion of the EDA.  The division requires
 24 31 the EDA to award financial assistance on a competitive basis
 24 32 and allows the EDA to develop scoring criteria and establish
 24 33 minimum requirements for the receipt of a financial assistance
 24 34 award.
 24 35    In addition to the four factors relating to the provider's
 25  1 professional staff that the EDA may consider under current
 25  2 law in deciding whether to award financial assistance, the
 25  3 division provides that the EDA may also consider the service
 25  4 model and likelihood of success of the provider, the provider's
 25  5 similarity to other successful providers in the country, and
 25  6 the provider's financial need.
 25  7    The division modifies the maximum award amount for a
 25  8 recipient.  Under current law, a grant to an entrepreneur
 25  9 assistance program cannot exceed the lesser of 25 percent of
 25 10 the funds expended by the program during the previous fiscal
 25 11 year, 100 percent of the funds raised from certain persons
 25 12 by the program during the previous fiscal year, or $200,000.
 25 13 The division provides that the amount of financial assistance
 25 14 awarded to any one provider shall not exceed $200,000.
 25 15    The division modifies the permitted use of funds received
 25 16 under the program.  Under current law, grants are only
 25 17 permitted to be used for the purpose of operating costs
 25 18 incurred by the program.  The division specifies that financial
 25 19 assistance awarded to a provider shall only be used for
 25 20 the purpose of operating costs incurred by the provider in
 25 21 the provision of business development services to emerging
 25 22 and early=stage innovation companies in Iowa.  The division
 25 23 further requires that such financial assistance shall not be
 25 24 distributed to owners or investors of the company to which the
 25 25 business development services are being provided and shall not
 25 26 be provided to other persons assisting with the provision of
 25 27 the services.
 25 28    Under current law, an entrepreneurial assistance provider is
 25 29 required to accept client referrals from the EDA as a condition
 25 30 of receiving a grant.  The division provides that the EDA may
 25 31 make client referrals to eligible providers.
 25 32    DIVISION IV ==== MISCELLANEOUS CHANGES.  Division IV makes
 25 33 several miscellaneous changes to other EDA programs.  The
 25 34 division amends the sales and use tax refund available under
 25 35 the workforce housing tax incentive program.  That refund
 26  1 is available for sales and use tax paid prior to project
 26  2 completion, which is currently defined to mean the first date
 26  3 upon which the average annualized production of finished
 26  4 product for the preceding 90=day period at the manufacturing
 26  5 facility operated by the eligible business is at least 50
 26  6 percent of the initial design capacity of the facility.  The
 26  7 division amends the definition of "project completion" to mean
 26  8 the date on which the EDA notifies the department of revenue
 26  9 that all applicable requirements of a workforce housing tax
 26 10 incentive program agreement are satisfied.  This provision
 26 11 takes effect upon enactment and applies retroactively to July
 26 12 1, 2014, for all workforce housing tax incentive agreements
 26 13 entered into on or after that date.
 26 14    The division allows the EDA to extend the project
 26 15 completion date for a project awarded tax incentives under the
 26 16 redevelopment tax credit program and the housing enterprise
 26 17 zone tax incentives program if the property that is the subject

 23 23    DIVISION III ==== ENTREPRENEUR INVESTMENT AWARDS PROGRAM.
 23 24  Division III amends the entrepreneur investment awards program
 23 25 administered by the EDA.  The division strikes provisions that
 23 26 prohibited the EDA from making awards under the program since
 23 27 July 1, 2014, and that required the EDA by December 31, 2014,
 23 28 to conduct a comprehensive review of the program and submit
 23 29 a report with specified information to the governor and the
 23 30 general assembly.

 24 16 business development services to emerging and early=stage

 24 24    Under current law, the EDA board could approve, deny, or
 24 25 defer each application for a grant, and was required to award
 24 26 grants on a first=come, first=served basis.  The division
 24 27 specifies that the EDA board has the discretion to approve,
 24 28 deny, or defer each application for financial assistance and
 24 29 that the amount of financial assistance awarded to a provider
 24 30 is within the discretion of the EDA.  The division requires
 24 31 the EDA to award financial assistance on a competitive basis
 24 32 and allows the EDA to develop scoring criteria and establish
 24 33 minimum requirements for the receipt of a financial assistance
 24 34 award.
 24 35    In addition to the four factors relating to the provider's
 25  1 professional staff that the EDA may consider under current
 25  2 law in deciding whether to award financial assistance, the
 25  3 division provides that the EDA may also consider the service
 25  4 model and likelihood of success of the provider, the provider's
 25  5 similarity to other successful providers in the country, and
 25  6 the provider's financial need.
 25  7    The division modifies the maximum award amount for a

 25 18 incurred by the program.  The division specifies that financial
 25 19 assistance awarded to a provider shall only be used for
 25 20 the purpose of operating costs incurred by the provider in
 25 21 the provision of business development services to emerging
 25 22 and early=stage innovation companies in Iowa.  The division

 26 14    The division allows the EDA to extend the project

 23 22 date of the division shall be governed by current law.
 23 23    DIVISION III ==== ENTREPRENEUR INVESTMENT AWARDS PROGRAM.
 23 24  Division III amends the entrepreneur investment awards program
 23 25 administered by the EDA.  The division strikes provisions that
 23 26 prohibited the EDA from making awards under the program since
 23 27 July 1, 2014, and that required the EDA by December 31, 2014,
 23 28 to conduct a comprehensive review of the program and submit
 23 29 a report with specified information to the governor and the
 23 30 general assembly.
 23 31    The division modifies the purpose of the program to be
 23 32 to provide financial assistance to eligible entrepreneurial
 23 33 assistance providers (provider) that provide technical and
 23 34 financial assistance to entrepreneurs and start=up companies
 23 35 seeking to create, locate, or expand a business in Iowa.
 24  1 "Financial assistance" is defined in the division.
 24  2    The division changes the requirements for receiving an
 24  3 award.  To be eligible to receive an award under current
 24  4 law, an entrepreneurial assistance program must have been
 24  5 an Iowa=based business, expended at least $500,000 during
 24  6 the previous fiscal year to provide technical and financial
 24  7 assistance services that meet the broad=based needs of
 24  8 entrepreneurs seeking to create, locate, or expand a business
 24  9 in Iowa that intends to derive more than 10 percent of its
 24 10 gross sales from markets outside Iowa; and must have engaged
 24 11 and communicated with certain other programs, funding sources,
 24 12 and entities for its entrepreneur clients.  The division
 24 13 amends the eligibility for receiving financial assistance to
 24 14 require that a provider have its principal place of operations
 24 15 in Iowa and that the provider offer a comprehensive set of
 24 16 business development services to emerging and early=stage
 24 17 innovation companies to assist in the creation, location,
 24 18 growth, and long=term success of the company in Iowa.
 24 19 "Business development services" is defined in the division.
 24 20 Business development services may be performed at the physical
 24 21 location of the provider or the company and may be provided in
 24 22 consideration of equity participation in the company, a fee for
 24 23 services, or a membership agreement with the company.
 24 24    Under current law, the EDA board could approve, deny, or
 24 25 defer each application for a grant, and was required to award
 24 26 grants on a first=come, first=served basis.  The division
 24 27 specifies that the EDA board has the discretion to approve,
 24 28 deny, or defer each application for financial assistance and
 24 29 that the amount of financial assistance awarded to a provider
 24 30 is within the discretion of the EDA.  The division requires
 24 31 the EDA to award financial assistance on a competitive basis
 24 32 and allows the EDA to develop scoring criteria and establish
 24 33 minimum requirements for the receipt of a financial assistance
 24 34 award.
 24 35    In addition to the four factors relating to the provider's
 25  1 professional staff that the EDA may consider under current
 25  2 law in deciding whether to award financial assistance, the
 25  3 division provides that the EDA may also consider the service
 25  4 model and likelihood of success of the provider, the provider's
 25  5 similarity to other successful providers in the country, and
 25  6 the provider's financial need.
 25  7    The division modifies the maximum award amount for a
 25  8 recipient.  Under current law, a grant to an entrepreneur
 25  9 assistance program cannot exceed the lesser of 25 percent of
 25 10 the funds expended by the program during the previous fiscal
 25 11 year, 100 percent of the funds raised from certain persons
 25 12 by the program during the previous fiscal year, or $200,000.
 25 13 The division provides that the amount of financial assistance
 25 14 awarded to any one provider shall not exceed $200,000.
 25 15    The division modifies the permitted use of funds received
 25 16 under the program.  Under current law, grants are only
 25 17 permitted to be used for the purpose of operating costs
 25 18 incurred by the program.  The division specifies that financial
 25 19 assistance awarded to a provider shall only be used for
 25 20 the purpose of operating costs incurred by the provider in
 25 21 the provision of business development services to emerging
 25 22 and early=stage innovation companies in Iowa.  The division
 25 23 further requires that such financial assistance shall not be
 25 24 distributed to owners or investors of the company to which the
 25 25 business development services are being provided and shall not
 25 26 be provided to other persons assisting with the provision of
 25 27 the services.
 25 28    Under current law, an entrepreneurial assistance provider is
 25 29 required to accept client referrals from the EDA as a condition
 25 30 of receiving a grant.  The division provides that the EDA may
 25 31 make client referrals to eligible providers.
 25 32    DIVISION IV ==== MISCELLANEOUS CHANGES.  Division IV makes
 25 33 several miscellaneous changes to other EDA programs.  The
 25 34 division amends the sales and use tax refund available under
 25 35 the workforce housing tax incentive program.  That refund
 26  1 is available for sales and use tax paid prior to project
 26  2 completion, which is currently defined to mean the first date
 26  3 upon which the average annualized production of finished
 26  4 product for the preceding 90=day period at the manufacturing
 26  5 facility operated by the eligible business is at least 50
 26  6 percent of the initial design capacity of the facility.  The
 26  7 division amends the definition of "project completion" to mean
 26  8 the date on which the EDA notifies the department of revenue
 26  9 that all applicable requirements of a workforce housing tax
 26 10 incentive program agreement are satisfied.  This provision
 26 11 takes effect upon enactment and applies retroactively to July
 26 12 1, 2014, for all workforce housing tax incentive agreements
 26 13 entered into on or after that date.
 26 14    The division allows the EDA to extend the project
 26 15 completion date for a project awarded tax incentives under the
 26 16 redevelopment tax credit program and the housing enterprise
 26 17 zone tax incentives program if the property that is the subject

 23 21 community=based seed capital fund made prior to the effective
 23 22 date of the division shall be governed by current law.
 23 23    DIVISION III ==== ENTREPRENEUR INVESTMENT AWARDS PROGRAM.
 23 24  Division III amends the entrepreneur investment awards program

 23 26 prohibited the EDA from making awards under the program since
 23 27 July 1, 2014, and that required the EDA by December 31, 2014,
 23 28 to conduct a comprehensive review of the program and submit

 23 33 assistance providers (provider) that provide technical and

 23 35 seeking to create, locate, or expand a business in Iowa.
 24  1 "Financial assistance" is defined in the division.
 24  2    The division changes the requirements for receiving an

 24  5 an Iowa=based business, expended at least $500,000 during
 24  6 the previous fiscal year to provide technical and financial
 24  7 assistance services that meet the broad=based needs of

 24  9 in Iowa that intends to derive more than 10 percent of its
 24 10 gross sales from markets outside Iowa; and must have engaged
 24 11 and communicated with certain other programs, funding sources,
 24 12 and entities for its entrepreneur clients.  The division
 24 13 amends the eligibility for receiving financial assistance to
 24 14 require that a provider have its principal place of operations
 24 15 in Iowa and that the provider offer a comprehensive set of
 24 16 business development services to emerging and early=stage
 24 17 innovation companies to assist in the creation, location,
 24 18 growth, and long=term success of the company in Iowa.
 24 19 "Business development services" is defined in the division.
 24 20 Business development services may be performed at the physical
 24 21 location of the provider or the company and may be provided in
 24 22 consideration of equity participation in the company, a fee for
 24 23 services, or a membership agreement with the company.
 24 24    Under current law, the EDA board could approve, deny, or
 24 25 defer each application for a grant, and was required to award
 24 26 grants on a first=come, first=served basis.  The division
 24 27 specifies that the EDA board has the discretion to approve,
 24 28 deny, or defer each application for financial assistance and
 24 29 that the amount of financial assistance awarded to a provider
 24 30 is within the discretion of the EDA.  The division requires
 24 31 the EDA to award financial assistance on a competitive basis
 24 32 and allows the EDA to develop scoring criteria and establish
 24 33 minimum requirements for the receipt of a financial assistance
 24 34 award.
 24 35    In addition to the four factors relating to the provider's
 25  1 professional staff that the EDA may consider under current
 25  2 law in deciding whether to award financial assistance, the
 25  3 division provides that the EDA may also consider the service
 25  4 model and likelihood of success of the provider, the provider's
 25  5 similarity to other successful providers in the country, and
 25  6 the provider's financial need.
 25  7    The division modifies the maximum award amount for a
 25  8 recipient.  Under current law, a grant to an entrepreneur
 25  9 assistance program cannot exceed the lesser of 25 percent of
 25 10 the funds expended by the program during the previous fiscal
 25 11 year, 100 percent of the funds raised from certain persons
 25 12 by the program during the previous fiscal year, or $200,000.

 25 19 assistance awarded to a provider shall only be used for
 25 20 the purpose of operating costs incurred by the provider in
 25 21 the provision of business development services to emerging
 25 22 and early=stage innovation companies in Iowa.  The division
 25 23 further requires that such financial assistance shall not be
 25 24 distributed to owners or investors of the company to which the
 25 25 business development services are being provided and shall not
 25 26 be provided to other persons assisting with the provision of
 25 27 the services.
 25 28    Under current law, an entrepreneurial assistance provider is
 25 29 required to accept client referrals from the EDA as a condition
 25 30 of receiving a grant.  The division provides that the EDA may
 25 31 make client referrals to eligible providers.
 25 32    DIVISION IV ==== MISCELLANEOUS CHANGES.  Division IV makes
 25 33 several miscellaneous changes to other EDA programs.  The

 25 16 under the program.  Under current law, grants are only
 25 17 permitted to be used for the purpose of operating costs
 25 18 incurred by the program.  The division specifies that financial
 25 19 assistance awarded to a provider shall only be used for
 25 20 the purpose of operating costs incurred by the provider in
 25 21 the provision of business development services to emerging
 25 22 and early=stage innovation companies in Iowa.  The division
 25 23 further requires that such financial assistance shall not be
 25 24 distributed to owners or investors of the company to which the
 25 25 business development services are being provided and shall not
 25 26 be provided to other persons assisting with the provision of
 25 27 the services.
 25 28    Under current law, an entrepreneurial assistance provider is
 25 29 required to accept client referrals from the EDA as a condition
 25 30 of receiving a grant.  The division provides that the EDA may
 25 31 make client referrals to eligible providers.
 25 32    DIVISION IV ==== MISCELLANEOUS CHANGES.  Division IV makes
 25 33 several miscellaneous changes to other EDA programs.  The
 25 34 division amends the sales and use tax refund available under
 25 35 the workforce housing tax incentive program.  That refund
 26  1 is available for sales and use tax paid prior to project
 26  2 completion, which is currently defined to mean the first date
 26  3 upon which the average annualized production of finished
 26  4 product for the preceding 90=day period at the manufacturing
 26  5 facility operated by the eligible business is at least 50
 26  6 percent of the initial design capacity of the facility.  The
 26  7 division amends the definition of "project completion" to mean
 26  8 the date on which the EDA notifies the department of revenue
 26  9 that all applicable requirements of a workforce housing tax
 26 10 incentive program agreement are satisfied.  This provision
 26 11 takes effect upon enactment and applies retroactively to July
 26 12 1, 2014, for all workforce housing tax incentive agreements
 26 13 entered into on or after that date.
 26 14    The division allows the EDA to extend the project
 26 15 completion date for a project awarded tax incentives under the
 26 16 redevelopment tax credit program and the housing enterprise
 26 17 zone tax incentives program if the property that is the subject
 26 18 of the project suffered a catastrophic fire during the 2014
 26 19 calendar year.

 23 19 equity investments in a qualifying business made on or after
 23 20 that date.  Equity investments in a qualifying business or
 23 21 community=based seed capital fund made prior to the effective
 23 22 date of the division shall be governed by current law.
 23 23    DIVISION III ==== ENTREPRENEUR INVESTMENT AWARDS PROGRAM.
 23 24  Division III amends the entrepreneur investment awards program
 23 25 administered by the EDA.  The division strikes provisions that
 23 26 prohibited the EDA from making awards under the program since
 23 27 July 1, 2014, and that required the EDA by December 31, 2014,
 23 28 to conduct a comprehensive review of the program and submit
 23 29 a report with specified information to the governor and the
 23 30 general assembly.
 23 31    The division modifies the purpose of the program to be
 23 32 to provide financial assistance to eligible entrepreneurial
 23 33 assistance providers (provider) that provide technical and
 23 34 financial assistance to entrepreneurs and start=up companies
 23 35 seeking to create, locate, or expand a business in Iowa.
 24  1 "Financial assistance" is defined in the division.
 24  2    The division changes the requirements for receiving an
 24  3 award.  To be eligible to receive an award under current
 24  4 law, an entrepreneurial assistance program must have been
 24  5 an Iowa=based business, expended at least $500,000 during
 24  6 the previous fiscal year to provide technical and financial
 24  7 assistance services that meet the broad=based needs of
 24  8 entrepreneurs seeking to create, locate, or expand a business
 24  9 in Iowa that intends to derive more than 10 percent of its
 24 10 gross sales from markets outside Iowa; and must have engaged
 24 11 and communicated with certain other programs, funding sources,
 24 12 and entities for its entrepreneur clients.  The division
 24 13 amends the eligibility for receiving financial assistance to
 24 14 require that a provider have its principal place of operations
 24 15 in Iowa and that the provider offer a comprehensive set of
 24 16 business development services to emerging and early=stage
 24 17 innovation companies to assist in the creation, location,
 24 18 growth, and long=term success of the company in Iowa.
 24 19 "Business development services" is defined in the division.
 24 20 Business development services may be performed at the physical
 24 21 location of the provider or the company and may be provided in
 24 22 consideration of equity participation in the company, a fee for
 24 23 services, or a membership agreement with the company.
 24 24    Under current law, the EDA board could approve, deny, or
 24 25 defer each application for a grant, and was required to award
 24 26 grants on a first=come, first=served basis.  The division
 24 27 specifies that the EDA board has the discretion to approve,
 24 28 deny, or defer each application for financial assistance and
 24 29 that the amount of financial assistance awarded to a provider
 24 30 is within the discretion of the EDA.  The division requires
 24 31 the EDA to award financial assistance on a competitive basis
 24 32 and allows the EDA to develop scoring criteria and establish
 24 33 minimum requirements for the receipt of a financial assistance
 24 34 award.
 24 35    In addition to the four factors relating to the provider's
 25  1 professional staff that the EDA may consider under current
 25  2 law in deciding whether to award financial assistance, the
 25  3 division provides that the EDA may also consider the service
 25  4 model and likelihood of success of the provider, the provider's
 25  5 similarity to other successful providers in the country, and
 25  6 the provider's financial need.
 25  7    The division modifies the maximum award amount for a
 25  8 recipient.  Under current law, a grant to an entrepreneur
 25  9 assistance program cannot exceed the lesser of 25 percent of
 25 10 the funds expended by the program during the previous fiscal
 25 11 year, 100 percent of the funds raised from certain persons
 25 12 by the program during the previous fiscal year, or $200,000.
 25 13 The division provides that the amount of financial assistance
 25 14 awarded to any one provider shall not exceed $200,000.
 25 15    The division modifies the permitted use of funds received
 25 16 under the program.  Under current law, grants are only
 25 17 permitted to be used for the purpose of operating costs
 25 18 incurred by the program.  The division specifies that financial
 25 19 assistance awarded to a provider shall only be used for
 25 20 the purpose of operating costs incurred by the provider in
 25 21 the provision of business development services to emerging
 25 22 and early=stage innovation companies in Iowa.  The division
 25 23 further requires that such financial assistance shall not be
 25 24 distributed to owners or investors of the company to which the
 25 25 business development services are being provided and shall not
 25 26 be provided to other persons assisting with the provision of
 25 27 the services.
 25 28    Under current law, an entrepreneurial assistance provider is
 25 29 required to accept client referrals from the EDA as a condition
 25 30 of receiving a grant.  The division provides that the EDA may
 25 31 make client referrals to eligible providers.

 25 26 be provided to other persons assisting with the provision of
 25 27 the services.
 25 28    Under current law, an entrepreneurial assistance provider is

 26  3 upon which the average annualized production of finished
 26  4 product for the preceding 90=day period at the manufacturing

 23 23    DIVISION III ==== ENTREPRENEUR INVESTMENT AWARDS PROGRAM.
 23 24  Division III amends the entrepreneur investment awards program

 23 28 to conduct a comprehensive review of the program and submit

 24 24    Under current law, the EDA board could approve, deny, or
 24 25 defer each application for a grant, and was required to award
 24 26 grants on a first=come, first=served basis.  The division

 24 30 is within the discretion of the EDA.  The division requires
 24 31 the EDA to award financial assistance on a competitive basis
 24 32 and allows the EDA to develop scoring criteria and establish
 24 33 minimum requirements for the receipt of a financial assistance
 24 34 award.

 25  2 law in deciding whether to award financial assistance, the
 25  3 division provides that the EDA may also consider the service
 25  4 model and likelihood of success of the provider, the provider's
 25  5 similarity to other successful providers in the country, and
 25  6 the provider's financial need.
 25  7    The division modifies the maximum award amount for a

 25  9 assistance program cannot exceed the lesser of 25 percent of
 25 10 the funds expended by the program during the previous fiscal

 25 21 the provision of business development services to emerging
 25 22 and early=stage innovation companies in Iowa.  The division

 25 24 distributed to owners or investors of the company to which the
 25 25 business development services are being provided and shall not
 25 26 be provided to other persons assisting with the provision of
 25 27 the services.
 25 28    Under current law, an entrepreneurial assistance provider is
 25 29 required to accept client referrals from the EDA as a condition

 25 32    DIVISION IV ==== MISCELLANEOUS CHANGES.  Division IV makes
 25 33 several miscellaneous changes to other EDA programs.  The
 25 34 division amends the sales and use tax refund available under
 25 35 the workforce housing tax incentive program.  That refund
 26  1 is available for sales and use tax paid prior to project
 26  2 completion, which is currently defined to mean the first date
 26  3 upon which the average annualized production of finished
 26  4 product for the preceding 90=day period at the manufacturing
 26  5 facility operated by the eligible business is at least 50
 26  6 percent of the initial design capacity of the facility.  The

 26  8 the date on which the EDA notifies the department of revenue
 26  9 that all applicable requirements of a workforce housing tax
 26 10 incentive program agreement are satisfied.  This provision
 26 11 takes effect upon enactment and applies retroactively to July
 26 12 1, 2014, for all workforce housing tax incentive agreements
 26 13 entered into on or after that date.
 26 14    The division allows the EDA to extend the project
 26 15 completion date for a project awarded tax incentives under the

 23 25 administered by the EDA.  The division strikes provisions that
 23 26 prohibited the EDA from making awards under the program since
 23 27 July 1, 2014, and that required the EDA by December 31, 2014,
 23 28 to conduct a comprehensive review of the program and submit
 23 29 a report with specified information to the governor and the

 24 10 gross sales from markets outside Iowa; and must have engaged
 24 11 and communicated with certain other programs, funding sources,
 24 12 and entities for its entrepreneur clients.  The division
 24 13 amends the eligibility for receiving financial assistance to
 24 14 require that a provider have its principal place of operations

 24 24    Under current law, the EDA board could approve, deny, or
 24 25 defer each application for a grant, and was required to award
 24 26 grants on a first=come, first=served basis.  The division
 24 27 specifies that the EDA board has the discretion to approve,
 24 28 deny, or defer each application for financial assistance and
 24 29 that the amount of financial assistance awarded to a provider
 24 30 is within the discretion of the EDA.  The division requires
 24 31 the EDA to award financial assistance on a competitive basis
 24 32 and allows the EDA to develop scoring criteria and establish
 24 33 minimum requirements for the receipt of a financial assistance
 24 34 award.

 25 17 permitted to be used for the purpose of operating costs
 25 18 incurred by the program.  The division specifies that financial
 25 19 assistance awarded to a provider shall only be used for

 25 21 the provision of business development services to emerging
 25 22 and early=stage innovation companies in Iowa.  The division

 26  1 is available for sales and use tax paid prior to project
 26  2 completion, which is currently defined to mean the first date
 26  3 upon which the average annualized production of finished
 26  4 product for the preceding 90=day period at the manufacturing
 26  5 facility operated by the eligible business is at least 50
 26  6 percent of the initial design capacity of the facility.  The
 26  7 division amends the definition of "project completion" to mean
 26  8 the date on which the EDA notifies the department of revenue
 26  9 that all applicable requirements of a workforce housing tax
 26 10 incentive program agreement are satisfied.  This provision
 26 11 takes effect upon enactment and applies retroactively to July
 26 12 1, 2014, for all workforce housing tax incentive agreements
 26 13 entered into on or after that date.
 26 14    The division allows the EDA to extend the project
 26 15 completion date for a project awarded tax incentives under the

 23 26 prohibited the EDA from making awards under the program since
 23 27 July 1, 2014, and that required the EDA by December 31, 2014,
 23 28 to conduct a comprehensive review of the program and submit
 23 29 a report with specified information to the governor and the
 23 30 general assembly.
 23 31    The division modifies the purpose of the program to be
 23 32 to provide financial assistance to eligible entrepreneurial
 23 33 assistance providers (provider) that provide technical and
 23 34 financial assistance to entrepreneurs and start=up companies
 23 35 seeking to create, locate, or expand a business in Iowa.
 24  1 "Financial assistance" is defined in the division.
 24  2    The division changes the requirements for receiving an
 24  3 award.  To be eligible to receive an award under current
 24  4 law, an entrepreneurial assistance program must have been
 24  5 an Iowa=based business, expended at least $500,000 during
 24  6 the previous fiscal year to provide technical and financial
 24  7 assistance services that meet the broad=based needs of
 24  8 entrepreneurs seeking to create, locate, or expand a business
 24  9 in Iowa that intends to derive more than 10 percent of its
 24 10 gross sales from markets outside Iowa; and must have engaged
 24 11 and communicated with certain other programs, funding sources,
 24 12 and entities for its entrepreneur clients.  The division
 24 13 amends the eligibility for receiving financial assistance to
 24 14 require that a provider have its principal place of operations
 24 15 in Iowa and that the provider offer a comprehensive set of
 24 16 business development services to emerging and early=stage
 24 17 innovation companies to assist in the creation, location,
 24 18 growth, and long=term success of the company in Iowa.

 24 24    Under current law, the EDA board could approve, deny, or
 24 25 defer each application for a grant, and was required to award
 24 26 grants on a first=come, first=served basis.  The division
 24 27 specifies that the EDA board has the discretion to approve,
 24 28 deny, or defer each application for financial assistance and
 24 29 that the amount of financial assistance awarded to a provider
 24 30 is within the discretion of the EDA.  The division requires
 24 31 the EDA to award financial assistance on a competitive basis
 24 32 and allows the EDA to develop scoring criteria and establish
 24 33 minimum requirements for the receipt of a financial assistance
 24 34 award.
 24 35    In addition to the four factors relating to the provider's
 25  1 professional staff that the EDA may consider under current
 25  2 law in deciding whether to award financial assistance, the
 25  3 division provides that the EDA may also consider the service
 25  4 model and likelihood of success of the provider, the provider's
 25  5 similarity to other successful providers in the country, and
 25  6 the provider's financial need.
 25  7    The division modifies the maximum award amount for a
 25  8 recipient.  Under current law, a grant to an entrepreneur
 25  9 assistance program cannot exceed the lesser of 25 percent of
 25 10 the funds expended by the program during the previous fiscal
 25 11 year, 100 percent of the funds raised from certain persons

 23 33 assistance providers (provider) that provide technical and
 23 34 financial assistance to entrepreneurs and start=up companies
 23 35 seeking to create, locate, or expand a business in Iowa.
 24  1 "Financial assistance" is defined in the division.
 24  2    The division changes the requirements for receiving an
 24  3 award.  To be eligible to receive an award under current
 24  4 law, an entrepreneurial assistance program must have been
 24  5 an Iowa=based business, expended at least $500,000 during
 24  6 the previous fiscal year to provide technical and financial
 24  7 assistance services that meet the broad=based needs of
 24  8 entrepreneurs seeking to create, locate, or expand a business
 24  9 in Iowa that intends to derive more than 10 percent of its
 24 10 gross sales from markets outside Iowa; and must have engaged
 24 11 and communicated with certain other programs, funding sources,
 24 12 and entities for its entrepreneur clients.  The division
 24 13 amends the eligibility for receiving financial assistance to
 24 14 require that a provider have its principal place of operations
 24 15 in Iowa and that the provider offer a comprehensive set of
 24 16 business development services to emerging and early=stage
 24 17 innovation companies to assist in the creation, location,
 24 18 growth, and long=term success of the company in Iowa.
 24 19 "Business development services" is defined in the division.
 24 20 Business development services may be performed at the physical
 24 21 location of the provider or the company and may be provided in
 24 22 consideration of equity participation in the company, a fee for
 24 23 services, or a membership agreement with the company.
 24 24    Under current law, the EDA board could approve, deny, or
 24 25 defer each application for a grant, and was required to award
 24 26 grants on a first=come, first=served basis.  The division
 24 27 specifies that the EDA board has the discretion to approve,
 24 28 deny, or defer each application for financial assistance and
 24 29 that the amount of financial assistance awarded to a provider
 24 30 is within the discretion of the EDA.  The division requires
 24 31 the EDA to award financial assistance on a competitive basis
 24 32 and allows the EDA to develop scoring criteria and establish
 24 33 minimum requirements for the receipt of a financial assistance
 24 34 award.
 24 35    In addition to the four factors relating to the provider's
 25  1 professional staff that the EDA may consider under current
 25  2 law in deciding whether to award financial assistance, the
 25  3 division provides that the EDA may also consider the service
 25  4 model and likelihood of success of the provider, the provider's
 25  5 similarity to other successful providers in the country, and
 25  6 the provider's financial need.
 25  7    The division modifies the maximum award amount for a
 25  8 recipient.  Under current law, a grant to an entrepreneur
 25  9 assistance program cannot exceed the lesser of 25 percent of
 25 10 the funds expended by the program during the previous fiscal
 25 11 year, 100 percent of the funds raised from certain persons
 25 12 by the program during the previous fiscal year, or $200,000.
 25 13 The division provides that the amount of financial assistance
 25 14 awarded to any one provider shall not exceed $200,000.
 25 15    The division modifies the permitted use of funds received
 25 16 under the program.  Under current law, grants are only
 25 17 permitted to be used for the purpose of operating costs
 25 18 incurred by the program.  The division specifies that financial
 25 19 assistance awarded to a provider shall only be used for
 25 20 the purpose of operating costs incurred by the provider in
 25 21 the provision of business development services to emerging
 25 22 and early=stage innovation companies in Iowa.  The division
 25 23 further requires that such financial assistance shall not be
 25 24 distributed to owners or investors of the company to which the
 25 25 business development services are being provided and shall not
 25 26 be provided to other persons assisting with the provision of
 25 27 the services.
 25 28    Under current law, an entrepreneurial assistance provider is
 25 29 required to accept client referrals from the EDA as a condition
 25 30 of receiving a grant.  The division provides that the EDA may
 25 31 make client referrals to eligible providers.

 25 33 several miscellaneous changes to other EDA programs.  The
 25 34 division amends the sales and use tax refund available under
 25 35 the workforce housing tax incentive program.  That refund
 26  1 is available for sales and use tax paid prior to project
 26  2 completion, which is currently defined to mean the first date
 26  3 upon which the average annualized production of finished
 26  4 product for the preceding 90=day period at the manufacturing
 26  5 facility operated by the eligible business is at least 50
 26  6 percent of the initial design capacity of the facility.  The
 26  7 division amends the definition of "project completion" to mean
 26  8 the date on which the EDA notifies the department of revenue
 26  9 that all applicable requirements of a workforce housing tax
 26 10 incentive program agreement are satisfied.  This provision
 26 11 takes effect upon enactment and applies retroactively to July

 26  3 upon which the average annualized production of finished
 26  4 product for the preceding 90=day period at the manufacturing
 26  5 facility operated by the eligible business is at least 50

 26 10 incentive program agreement are satisfied.  This provision
 26 11 takes effect upon enactment and applies retroactively to July

 26 13 entered into on or after that date.
 26 14    The division allows the EDA to extend the project

 25  2 law in deciding whether to award financial assistance, the
 25  3 division provides that the EDA may also consider the service

 24 23 services, or a membership agreement with the company.
 24 24    Under current law, the EDA board could approve, deny, or
 24 25 defer each application for a grant, and was required to award
 24 26 grants on a first=come, first=served basis.  The division
 24 27 specifies that the EDA board has the discretion to approve,
 24 28 deny, or defer each application for financial assistance and
 24 29 that the amount of financial assistance awarded to a provider
 24 30 is within the discretion of the EDA.  The division requires
 24 31 the EDA to award financial assistance on a competitive basis
 24 32 and allows the EDA to develop scoring criteria and establish
 24 33 minimum requirements for the receipt of a financial assistance
 24 34 award.
 24 35    In addition to the four factors relating to the provider's
 25  1 professional staff that the EDA may consider under current
 25  2 law in deciding whether to award financial assistance, the
 25  3 division provides that the EDA may also consider the service
 25  4 model and likelihood of success of the provider, the provider's
 25  5 similarity to other successful providers in the country, and
 25  6 the provider's financial need.
 25  7    The division modifies the maximum award amount for a
 25  8 recipient.  Under current law, a grant to an entrepreneur
 25  9 assistance program cannot exceed the lesser of 25 percent of
 25 10 the funds expended by the program during the previous fiscal
 25 11 year, 100 percent of the funds raised from certain persons
 25 12 by the program during the previous fiscal year, or $200,000.
 25 13 The division provides that the amount of financial assistance
 25 14 awarded to any one provider shall not exceed $200,000.
 25 15    The division modifies the permitted use of funds received
 25 16 under the program.  Under current law, grants are only
 25 17 permitted to be used for the purpose of operating costs
 25 18 incurred by the program.  The division specifies that financial
 25 19 assistance awarded to a provider shall only be used for
 25 20 the purpose of operating costs incurred by the provider in
 25 21 the provision of business development services to emerging
 25 22 and early=stage innovation companies in Iowa.  The division
 25 23 further requires that such financial assistance shall not be
 25 24 distributed to owners or investors of the company to which the
 25 25 business development services are being provided and shall not
 25 26 be provided to other persons assisting with the provision of
 25 27 the services.
 25 28    Under current law, an entrepreneurial assistance provider is
 25 29 required to accept client referrals from the EDA as a condition
 25 30 of receiving a grant.  The division provides that the EDA may
 25 31 make client referrals to eligible providers.
 25 32    DIVISION IV ==== MISCELLANEOUS CHANGES.  Division IV makes
 25 33 several miscellaneous changes to other EDA programs.  The
 25 34 division amends the sales and use tax refund available under
 25 35 the workforce housing tax incentive program.  That refund
 26  1 is available for sales and use tax paid prior to project
 26  2 completion, which is currently defined to mean the first date
 26  3 upon which the average annualized production of finished
 26  4 product for the preceding 90=day period at the manufacturing
 26  5 facility operated by the eligible business is at least 50
 26  6 percent of the initial design capacity of the facility.  The
 26  7 division amends the definition of "project completion" to mean
 26  8 the date on which the EDA notifies the department of revenue
 26  9 that all applicable requirements of a workforce housing tax
 26 10 incentive program agreement are satisfied.  This provision
 26 11 takes effect upon enactment and applies retroactively to July
 26 12 1, 2014, for all workforce housing tax incentive agreements
 26 13 entered into on or after that date.
 26 14    The division allows the EDA to extend the project
 26 15 completion date for a project awarded tax incentives under the
 26 16 redevelopment tax credit program and the housing enterprise
 26 17 zone tax incentives program if the property that is the subject

 24 32 and allows the EDA to develop scoring criteria and establish

 24 34 award.
 24 35    In addition to the four factors relating to the provider's
 25  1 professional staff that the EDA may consider under current
 25  2 law in deciding whether to award financial assistance, the
 25  3 division provides that the EDA may also consider the service

 25 33 several miscellaneous changes to other EDA programs.  The
 25 34 division amends the sales and use tax refund available under
 25 35 the workforce housing tax incentive program.  That refund
 26  1 is available for sales and use tax paid prior to project
 26  2 completion, which is currently defined to mean the first date
 26  3 upon which the average annualized production of finished
 26  4 product for the preceding 90=day period at the manufacturing
 26  5 facility operated by the eligible business is at least 50
 26  6 percent of the initial design capacity of the facility.  The
 26  7 division amends the definition of "project completion" to mean
 26  8 the date on which the EDA notifies the department of revenue
 26  9 that all applicable requirements of a workforce housing tax
 26 10 incentive program agreement are satisfied.  This provision
 26 11 takes effect upon enactment and applies retroactively to July
 26 12 1, 2014, for all workforce housing tax incentive agreements
 26 13 entered into on or after that date.
 26 14    The division allows the EDA to extend the project
 26 15 completion date for a project awarded tax incentives under the

 24 34 award.
 24 35    In addition to the four factors relating to the provider's

 25  5 similarity to other successful providers in the country, and
 25  6 the provider's financial need.

 25  9 assistance program cannot exceed the lesser of 25 percent of

 25 11 year, 100 percent of the funds raised from certain persons
