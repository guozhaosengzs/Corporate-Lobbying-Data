  5 31                           EXPLANATION
  5 32 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  5 33 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  5 34    This bill makes statutory changes affecting the duties and
  5 35 authority of the state board of education and the department of
  6  1 education, repeals certain programs, and modifies or eliminates
  6  2 provisions relating to certain programs and activities under
  6  3 the purview of the state board and the department.
  6  4    CERTAIN DIRECTOR'S DUTIES STRICKEN.  The bill strikes from
  6  5 Code section 256.9, which provides for the duties of the
  6  6 director of the department of education, provisions which
  6  7 require the director to cause to be printed in book form, every
  6  8 four years, all school laws in force and any amendments or
  6  9 changes in school laws, along with other information which may
  6 10 aid school officers; to develop a model written publications
  6 11 code for the regulation of time, place, and manner of student
  6 12 expression; and to submit to the general assembly an annual
  6 13 report regarding the activities, findings, and student progress
  6 14 under the core curriculum, as well as an annual report on the
  6 15 necessity of waiving statutory obligations for school districts
  6 16 in the event of a disaster.
  6 17    BUDGET GUARANTEE LANGUAGE.  The bill amends Code section
  6 18 257.14 to strike obsolete language relating to the budget
  6 19 guarantee.
  6 20    ATTENDING SCHOOL OUTSIDE THE STATE.  The bill makes a number
  6 21 of changes to Code section 282.8.  The Code section authorizes
  6 22 the boards of directors of school districts located near the
  6 23 state boundaries to designate schools of equivalent standing
  6 24 across the state line for attendance of pupils, to establish
  6 25 reciprocal agreements between such districts, and to establish
  6 26 tuition and transportation fees in an amount acceptable to the
  6 27 affected boards.
  6 28    Currently, Code section 282.8 provides that tuition and
  6 29 transportation fees shall not be less than the lower average
  6 30 cost per pupil for the previous school year of the two
  6 31 affected school districts.  The bill amends the provision to
  6 32 establish that the tuition fee for students not requiring
  6 33 special education shall not be less than the lower of the
  6 34 tuition fee established pursuant to Code section 282.24 for
  6 35 students attending school outside the district of residence or
  7  1 the equivalent tuition rate for the non=Iowa school district
  7  2 for the previous school year, and the transportation fee
  7  3 established shall not be less than the lower average cost per
  7  4 mile for yellow school buses for the previous school year of
  7  5 the two affected school districts.  The bill also provides that
  7  6 if the tuition fee for the school district in the adjoining
  7  7 state is a variable rate, the test of which tuition fee is
  7  8 lower shall be determined for each student. For students
  7  9 requiring special education, the bill provides that the tuition
  7 10 fee shall be equal to the actual cost of the special education
  7 11 instructional program provided to that child under the child's
  7 12 individualized education program.
  7 13    If there is no agreement between districts, or if the
  7 14 distance requirements are not met, the bill provides that the
  7 15 tuition limitations of Code section 282.1 shall not apply,
  7 16 and a student attending school in the other state shall not
  7 17 be treated as a pupil of the district of residence in Iowa
  7 18 for purposes of tuition payments to the receiving district
  7 19 or for purposes of the school aid formula.  The bill further
  7 20 establishes that an agreement reached under Code section 282.8
  7 21 does not qualify as a whole grade sharing agreement and the
  7 22 open enrollment provisions do not apply to such an agreement.
  7 23    WHOLE GRADE SHARING AGREEMENTS.  Whole grade sharing
  7 24 is a procedure used by school districts in which all or a
  7 25 substantial portion of the pupils in any grade in two or
  7 26 more school districts share an educational program for all
  7 27 or a substantial portion of a school day under a written
  7 28 agreement.  Currently, the boards of the school districts
  7 29 participating in the agreement must negotiate, as part of
  7 30 the new or existing agreement, the disposition of funding
  7 31 provided under Code chapter 284, the student achievement and
  7 32 teacher quality program.  The bill provides exemptions from
  7 33 the disposition negotiation requirement relating to beginning
  7 34 teacher mentoring and induction funds; the teacher leadership
  7 35 supplement state cost per pupil, unless all of the districts
  8  1 subject to the agreement are receiving such funding; and the
  8  2 teacher leadership supplemental aid payments, unless all
  8  3 districts subject to the agreement are receiving such funding.
  8  4 Because the funding for the teacher leadership supplemental aid
  8  5 payments is scheduled to end with the 2016=2017 fiscal year,
  8  6 the bill repeals the relevant provision June 30, 2018.
  8  7    The bill also changes, from the third Friday of February to
  8  8 the second Friday of January of each year, the second of two
  8  9 dates used to determine the number of pupils participating in a
  8 10 whole grade sharing agreement.
  8 11    OPEN ENROLLMENT PAYMENTS.  In addition to other statutory
  8 12 requirements for open enrollment payments, the bill provides
  8 13 that the board of directors of the district of residence
  8 14 must pay to the receiving district the teacher leadership
  8 15 supplement state cost per pupil for the previous fiscal year
  8 16 or the teacher leadership supplement foundation aid for the
  8 17 previous fiscal year if both the district of residence and the
  8 18 receiving district are receiving such supplements.  Such a
  8 19 limitation currently exists in Code section 284.13, subsection
  8 20 1, paragraph "e", regarding the teacher leadership supplement
  8 21 foundation aid.  Currently, the district of residence must pay
  8 22 to the receiving district the teacher leadership supplement
  8 23 state cost per pupil for the previous fiscal year whether
  8 24 or not both districts are receiving the teacher leadership
  8 25 supplement state cost per pupil.
  8 26    Currently, a district of residence must make quarterly
  8 27 payments to the receiving district.  Under the bill, the
  8 28 receiving district must bill the district of residence
  8 29 biannually, and the district of residence must make payments
  8 30 in a timely manner.
  8 31    STATEWIDE PROGRESS REPORTS.  Currently, the department of
  8 32 education must make an annual report to the general assembly
  8 33 on statewide progress in student achievement on mathematics
  8 34 and reading at the fourth and eighth grades, on the evaluator
  8 35 training program, and on changes and improvements in teacher
  9  1 evaluations.  The bill eliminates that reporting requirement.
  9  2    STUDENT ACHIEVEMENT AND TEACHER QUALITY PROGRAM.  Currently,
  9  3 in developing administrative rules for consideration by the
  9  4 state board of education, the department must consult with
  9  5 persons representing teachers, administrators, school boards,
  9  6 approved practitioner preparation institutions, and other
  9  7 appropriate education stakeholders.  The bill provides that the
  9  8 department must consult stakeholders when those stakeholders
  9  9 might reasonably be affected by the proposed rule.
  9 10    TERMINOLOGY CHANGES.  Code sections 282.8 and 282.24 are
  9 11 amended to replace references to "elementary and high school"
  9 12 with the term "elementary and secondary school". Definitions
  9 13 for junior high school and high school are also stricken from
  9 14 Code section 282.24.
  9 15    REPEALS.  The bill repeals the following:
  9 16    1.  PILOT PROJECTS TO IMPROVE INSTRUCTIONAL PROGRAMS.  When
  9 17 first enacted in 1987, the provision was part of a program
  9 18 to offer incentives to school districts that established
  9 19 pilot projects to utilize a modified block schedule for
  9 20 offering classes in the districts and sharing the certificated
  9 21 instructional personnel.  Implementation by the department
  9 22 of education is dependent on whether the general assembly
  9 23 appropriates funding for the pilot projects.
  9 24    2.  TEACHER EXCHANGE PROGRAM.  The teacher exchange program
  9 25 was enacted in 1991, contingent on an appropriation of moneys
  9 26 by the general assembly, to permit school districts to exchange
  9 27 licensed instructional personnel with other districts in order
  9 28 to promote the exchange and enhancement of instructional
  9 29 methods and materials and encourage the educational development
  9 30 of Iowa's teachers.  The bill eliminates the provisions
  9 31 relating to the teacher exchange program, including provisions
  9 32 directing the state board to adopt rules to administer the
  9 33 program, directing the director of the department of education
  9 34 to administer the program, establishing the program, and
  9 35 providing for participation in the program by school districts
 10  1 and teachers.

  7 17 be treated as a pupil of the district of residence in Iowa
  7 18 for purposes of tuition payments to the receiving district
  7 19 or for purposes of the school aid formula.  The bill further
  7 20 establishes that an agreement reached under Code section 282.8
  7 21 does not qualify as a whole grade sharing agreement and the
  7 22 open enrollment provisions do not apply to such an agreement.
  7 23    WHOLE GRADE SHARING AGREEMENTS.  Whole grade sharing
  7 24 is a procedure used by school districts in which all or a
  7 25 substantial portion of the pupils in any grade in two or
  7 26 more school districts share an educational program for all
  7 27 or a substantial portion of a school day under a written
  7 28 agreement.  Currently, the boards of the school districts
  7 29 participating in the agreement must negotiate, as part of
  7 30 the new or existing agreement, the disposition of funding
  7 31 provided under Code chapter 284, the student achievement and
  7 32 teacher quality program.  The bill provides exemptions from
  7 33 the disposition negotiation requirement relating to beginning
  7 34 teacher mentoring and induction funds; the teacher leadership
  7 35 supplement state cost per pupil, unless all of the districts
  8  1 subject to the agreement are receiving such funding; and the
  8  2 teacher leadership supplemental aid payments, unless all
  8  3 districts subject to the agreement are receiving such funding.
  8  4 Because the funding for the teacher leadership supplemental aid
  8  5 payments is scheduled to end with the 2016=2017 fiscal year,
  8  6 the bill repeals the relevant provision June 30, 2018.
  8  7    The bill also changes, from the third Friday of February to
  8  8 the second Friday of January of each year, the second of two
  8  9 dates used to determine the number of pupils participating in a
  8 10 whole grade sharing agreement.
  8 11    OPEN ENROLLMENT PAYMENTS.  In addition to other statutory
  8 12 requirements for open enrollment payments, the bill provides
  8 13 that the board of directors of the district of residence
  8 14 must pay to the receiving district the teacher leadership
  8 15 supplement state cost per pupil for the previous fiscal year
  8 16 or the teacher leadership supplement foundation aid for the
  8 17 previous fiscal year if both the district of residence and the
  8 18 receiving district are receiving such supplements.  Such a
  8 19 limitation currently exists in Code section 284.13, subsection
  8 20 1, paragraph "e", regarding the teacher leadership supplement
  8 21 foundation aid.  Currently, the district of residence must pay
  8 22 to the receiving district the teacher leadership supplement
  8 23 state cost per pupil for the previous fiscal year whether
  8 24 or not both districts are receiving the teacher leadership
  8 25 supplement state cost per pupil.
  8 26    Currently, a district of residence must make quarterly
  8 27 payments to the receiving district.  Under the bill, the
  8 28 receiving district must bill the district of residence
  8 29 biannually, and the district of residence must make payments
  8 30 in a timely manner.
  8 31    STATEWIDE PROGRESS REPORTS.  Currently, the department of
  8 32 education must make an annual report to the general assembly
  8 33 on statewide progress in student achievement on mathematics
  8 34 and reading at the fourth and eighth grades, on the evaluator
  8 35 training program, and on changes and improvements in teacher
  9  1 evaluations.  The bill eliminates that reporting requirement.
  9  2    STUDENT ACHIEVEMENT AND TEACHER QUALITY PROGRAM.  Currently,
  9  3 in developing administrative rules for consideration by the
  9  4 state board of education, the department must consult with
  9  5 persons representing teachers, administrators, school boards,
  9  6 approved practitioner preparation institutions, and other
  9  7 appropriate education stakeholders.  The bill provides that the
  9  8 department must consult stakeholders when those stakeholders
  9  9 might reasonably be affected by the proposed rule.
  9 10    TERMINOLOGY CHANGES.  Code sections 282.8 and 282.24 are
  9 11 amended to replace references to "elementary and high school"
  9 12 with the term "elementary and secondary school". Definitions
  9 13 for junior high school and high school are also stricken from
  9 14 Code section 282.24.
  9 15    REPEALS.  The bill repeals the following:
  9 16    1.  PILOT PROJECTS TO IMPROVE INSTRUCTIONAL PROGRAMS.  When
  9 17 first enacted in 1987, the provision was part of a program
  9 18 to offer incentives to school districts that established
  9 19 pilot projects to utilize a modified block schedule for
  9 20 offering classes in the districts and sharing the certificated
  9 21 instructional personnel.  Implementation by the department
  9 22 of education is dependent on whether the general assembly
  9 23 appropriates funding for the pilot projects.
  9 24    2.  TEACHER EXCHANGE PROGRAM.  The teacher exchange program
  9 25 was enacted in 1991, contingent on an appropriation of moneys
  9 26 by the general assembly, to permit school districts to exchange
  9 27 licensed instructional personnel with other districts in order
  9 28 to promote the exchange and enhancement of instructional
  9 29 methods and materials and encourage the educational development
  9 30 of Iowa's teachers.  The bill eliminates the provisions
  9 31 relating to the teacher exchange program, including provisions
  9 32 directing the state board to adopt rules to administer the
  9 33 program, directing the director of the department of education
  9 34 to administer the program, establishing the program, and
  9 35 providing for participation in the program by school districts
 10  1 and teachers.

  5 32 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  5 33 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  5 34    This bill makes statutory changes affecting the duties and
  5 35 authority of the state board of education and the department of
  6  1 education, repeals certain programs, and modifies or eliminates
  6  2 provisions relating to certain programs and activities under
  6  3 the purview of the state board and the department.
  6  4    CERTAIN DIRECTOR'S DUTIES STRICKEN.  The bill strikes from
  6  5 Code section 256.9, which provides for the duties of the
  6  6 director of the department of education, provisions which
  6  7 require the director to cause to be printed in book form, every
  6  8 four years, all school laws in force and any amendments or
  6  9 changes in school laws, along with other information which may
  6 10 aid school officers; to develop a model written publications
  6 11 code for the regulation of time, place, and manner of student
  6 12 expression; and to submit to the general assembly an annual
  6 13 report regarding the activities, findings, and student progress
  6 14 under the core curriculum, as well as an annual report on the
  6 15 necessity of waiving statutory obligations for school districts
  6 16 in the event of a disaster.
  6 17    BUDGET GUARANTEE LANGUAGE.  The bill amends Code section
  6 18 257.14 to strike obsolete language relating to the budget
  6 19 guarantee.
  6 20    ATTENDING SCHOOL OUTSIDE THE STATE.  The bill makes a number
  6 21 of changes to Code section 282.8.  The Code section authorizes
  6 22 the boards of directors of school districts located near the
  6 23 state boundaries to designate schools of equivalent standing
  6 24 across the state line for attendance of pupils, to establish
  6 25 reciprocal agreements between such districts, and to establish
  6 26 tuition and transportation fees in an amount acceptable to the
  6 27 affected boards.
  6 28    Currently, Code section 282.8 provides that tuition and
  6 29 transportation fees shall not be less than the lower average
  6 30 cost per pupil for the previous school year of the two
  6 31 affected school districts.  The bill amends the provision to
  6 32 establish that the tuition fee for students not requiring
  6 33 special education shall not be less than the lower of the
  6 34 tuition fee established pursuant to Code section 282.24 for
  6 35 students attending school outside the district of residence or
  7  1 the equivalent tuition rate for the non=Iowa school district
  7  2 for the previous school year, and the transportation fee
  7  3 established shall not be less than the lower average cost per
  7  4 mile for yellow school buses for the previous school year of
  7  5 the two affected school districts.  The bill also provides that
  7  6 if the tuition fee for the school district in the adjoining
  7  7 state is a variable rate, the test of which tuition fee is
  7  8 lower shall be determined for each student. For students
  7  9 requiring special education, the bill provides that the tuition
  7 10 fee shall be equal to the actual cost of the special education
  7 11 instructional program provided to that child under the child's
  7 12 individualized education program.
  7 13    If there is no agreement between districts, or if the
  7 14 distance requirements are not met, the bill provides that the
  7 15 tuition limitations of Code section 282.1 shall not apply,
  7 16 and a student attending school in the other state shall not
  7 17 be treated as a pupil of the district of residence in Iowa
  7 18 for purposes of tuition payments to the receiving district
  7 19 or for purposes of the school aid formula.  The bill further
  7 20 establishes that an agreement reached under Code section 282.8
  7 21 does not qualify as a whole grade sharing agreement and the
  7 22 open enrollment provisions do not apply to such an agreement.
  7 23    WHOLE GRADE SHARING AGREEMENTS.  Whole grade sharing
  7 24 is a procedure used by school districts in which all or a
  7 25 substantial portion of the pupils in any grade in two or
  7 26 more school districts share an educational program for all
  7 27 or a substantial portion of a school day under a written

  7 29 participating in the agreement must negotiate, as part of

  7 34 teacher mentoring and induction funds; the teacher leadership
  7 35 supplement state cost per pupil, unless all of the districts
  8  1 subject to the agreement are receiving such funding; and the
  8  2 teacher leadership supplemental aid payments, unless all
  8  3 districts subject to the agreement are receiving such funding.
  8  4 Because the funding for the teacher leadership supplemental aid
  8  5 payments is scheduled to end with the 2016=2017 fiscal year,
  8  6 the bill repeals the relevant provision June 30, 2018.
  8  7    The bill also changes, from the third Friday of February to

  8 15 supplement state cost per pupil for the previous fiscal year
  8 16 or the teacher leadership supplement foundation aid for the

  8 18 receiving district are receiving such supplements.  Such a
  8 19 limitation currently exists in Code section 284.13, subsection
  8 20 1, paragraph "e", regarding the teacher leadership supplement
  8 21 foundation aid.  Currently, the district of residence must pay
  8 22 to the receiving district the teacher leadership supplement
  8 23 state cost per pupil for the previous fiscal year whether
  8 24 or not both districts are receiving the teacher leadership
  8 25 supplement state cost per pupil.
  8 26    Currently, a district of residence must make quarterly
  8 27 payments to the receiving district.  Under the bill, the
  8 28 receiving district must bill the district of residence
  8 29 biannually, and the district of residence must make payments
  8 30 in a timely manner.
  8 31    STATEWIDE PROGRESS REPORTS.  Currently, the department of
  8 32 education must make an annual report to the general assembly
  8 33 on statewide progress in student achievement on mathematics

  6 18 257.14 to strike obsolete language relating to the budget
  6 19 guarantee.
  6 20    ATTENDING SCHOOL OUTSIDE THE STATE.  The bill makes a number
  6 21 of changes to Code section 282.8.  The Code section authorizes
  6 22 the boards of directors of school districts located near the
  6 23 state boundaries to designate schools of equivalent standing
  6 24 across the state line for attendance of pupils, to establish
  6 25 reciprocal agreements between such districts, and to establish
  6 26 tuition and transportation fees in an amount acceptable to the
  6 27 affected boards.
  6 28    Currently, Code section 282.8 provides that tuition and
  6 29 transportation fees shall not be less than the lower average
  6 30 cost per pupil for the previous school year of the two
  6 31 affected school districts.  The bill amends the provision to
  6 32 establish that the tuition fee for students not requiring
  6 33 special education shall not be less than the lower of the
  6 34 tuition fee established pursuant to Code section 282.24 for
  6 35 students attending school outside the district of residence or
  7  1 the equivalent tuition rate for the non=Iowa school district
  7  2 for the previous school year, and the transportation fee
  7  3 established shall not be less than the lower average cost per
  7  4 mile for yellow school buses for the previous school year of
  7  5 the two affected school districts.  The bill also provides that
  7  6 if the tuition fee for the school district in the adjoining
  7  7 state is a variable rate, the test of which tuition fee is
  7  8 lower shall be determined for each student. For students
  7  9 requiring special education, the bill provides that the tuition
  7 10 fee shall be equal to the actual cost of the special education
  7 11 instructional program provided to that child under the child's
  7 12 individualized education program.
  7 13    If there is no agreement between districts, or if the
  7 14 distance requirements are not met, the bill provides that the
  7 15 tuition limitations of Code section 282.1 shall not apply,
  7 16 and a student attending school in the other state shall not
  7 17 be treated as a pupil of the district of residence in Iowa
  7 18 for purposes of tuition payments to the receiving district
  7 19 or for purposes of the school aid formula.  The bill further
  7 20 establishes that an agreement reached under Code section 282.8
  7 21 does not qualify as a whole grade sharing agreement and the
  7 22 open enrollment provisions do not apply to such an agreement.
  7 23    WHOLE GRADE SHARING AGREEMENTS.  Whole grade sharing
  7 24 is a procedure used by school districts in which all or a
  7 25 substantial portion of the pupils in any grade in two or
  7 26 more school districts share an educational program for all
  7 27 or a substantial portion of a school day under a written
  7 28 agreement.  Currently, the boards of the school districts
  7 29 participating in the agreement must negotiate, as part of
  7 30 the new or existing agreement, the disposition of funding
  7 31 provided under Code chapter 284, the student achievement and
  7 32 teacher quality program.  The bill provides exemptions from
  7 33 the disposition negotiation requirement relating to beginning
  7 34 teacher mentoring and induction funds; the teacher leadership
  7 35 supplement state cost per pupil, unless all of the districts
  8  1 subject to the agreement are receiving such funding; and the
  8  2 teacher leadership supplemental aid payments, unless all
  8  3 districts subject to the agreement are receiving such funding.
  8  4 Because the funding for the teacher leadership supplemental aid
  8  5 payments is scheduled to end with the 2016=2017 fiscal year,
  8  6 the bill repeals the relevant provision June 30, 2018.
  8  7    The bill also changes, from the third Friday of February to
  8  8 the second Friday of January of each year, the second of two
  8  9 dates used to determine the number of pupils participating in a
  8 10 whole grade sharing agreement.
  8 11    OPEN ENROLLMENT PAYMENTS.  In addition to other statutory
  8 12 requirements for open enrollment payments, the bill provides
  8 13 that the board of directors of the district of residence
  8 14 must pay to the receiving district the teacher leadership
  8 15 supplement state cost per pupil for the previous fiscal year
  8 16 or the teacher leadership supplement foundation aid for the
  8 17 previous fiscal year if both the district of residence and the
  8 18 receiving district are receiving such supplements.  Such a
  8 19 limitation currently exists in Code section 284.13, subsection
  8 20 1, paragraph "e", regarding the teacher leadership supplement
  8 21 foundation aid.  Currently, the district of residence must pay
  8 22 to the receiving district the teacher leadership supplement
  8 23 state cost per pupil for the previous fiscal year whether
  8 24 or not both districts are receiving the teacher leadership
  8 25 supplement state cost per pupil.
  8 26    Currently, a district of residence must make quarterly
  8 27 payments to the receiving district.  Under the bill, the
  8 28 receiving district must bill the district of residence
  8 29 biannually, and the district of residence must make payments
  8 30 in a timely manner.
  8 31    STATEWIDE PROGRESS REPORTS.  Currently, the department of
  8 32 education must make an annual report to the general assembly
  8 33 on statewide progress in student achievement on mathematics
  8 34 and reading at the fourth and eighth grades, on the evaluator
  8 35 training program, and on changes and improvements in teacher
  9  1 evaluations.  The bill eliminates that reporting requirement.
  9  2    STUDENT ACHIEVEMENT AND TEACHER QUALITY PROGRAM.  Currently,
  9  3 in developing administrative rules for consideration by the
  9  4 state board of education, the department must consult with
  9  5 persons representing teachers, administrators, school boards,
  9  6 approved practitioner preparation institutions, and other
  9  7 appropriate education stakeholders.  The bill provides that the
  9  8 department must consult stakeholders when those stakeholders
  9  9 might reasonably be affected by the proposed rule.
  9 10    TERMINOLOGY CHANGES.  Code sections 282.8 and 282.24 are
  9 11 amended to replace references to "elementary and high school"
  9 12 with the term "elementary and secondary school". Definitions
  9 13 for junior high school and high school are also stricken from
  9 14 Code section 282.24.
  9 15    REPEALS.  The bill repeals the following:
  9 16    1.  PILOT PROJECTS TO IMPROVE INSTRUCTIONAL PROGRAMS.  When
  9 17 first enacted in 1987, the provision was part of a program
  9 18 to offer incentives to school districts that established
  9 19 pilot projects to utilize a modified block schedule for
  9 20 offering classes in the districts and sharing the certificated
  9 21 instructional personnel.  Implementation by the department
  9 22 of education is dependent on whether the general assembly
  9 23 appropriates funding for the pilot projects.
  9 24    2.  TEACHER EXCHANGE PROGRAM.  The teacher exchange program
  9 25 was enacted in 1991, contingent on an appropriation of moneys
  9 26 by the general assembly, to permit school districts to exchange
  9 27 licensed instructional personnel with other districts in order
  9 28 to promote the exchange and enhancement of instructional
  9 29 methods and materials and encourage the educational development
  9 30 of Iowa's teachers.  The bill eliminates the provisions
  9 31 relating to the teacher exchange program, including provisions
  9 32 directing the state board to adopt rules to administer the
  9 33 program, directing the director of the department of education
  9 34 to administer the program, establishing the program, and
  9 35 providing for participation in the program by school districts
 10  1 and teachers.

  6  7 require the director to cause to be printed in book form, every

  5 34    This bill makes statutory changes affecting the duties and
  5 35 authority of the state board of education and the department of
  6  1 education, repeals certain programs, and modifies or eliminates
  6  2 provisions relating to certain programs and activities under
  6  3 the purview of the state board and the department.
  6  4    CERTAIN DIRECTOR'S DUTIES STRICKEN.  The bill strikes from
  6  5 Code section 256.9, which provides for the duties of the
  6  6 director of the department of education, provisions which
  6  7 require the director to cause to be printed in book form, every
  6  8 four years, all school laws in force and any amendments or
  6  9 changes in school laws, along with other information which may
  6 10 aid school officers; to develop a model written publications
  6 11 code for the regulation of time, place, and manner of student
  6 12 expression; and to submit to the general assembly an annual
  6 13 report regarding the activities, findings, and student progress
  6 14 under the core curriculum, as well as an annual report on the
  6 15 necessity of waiving statutory obligations for school districts
  6 16 in the event of a disaster.
  6 17    BUDGET GUARANTEE LANGUAGE.  The bill amends Code section
  6 18 257.14 to strike obsolete language relating to the budget
  6 19 guarantee.
  6 20    ATTENDING SCHOOL OUTSIDE THE STATE.  The bill makes a number
  6 21 of changes to Code section 282.8.  The Code section authorizes
  6 22 the boards of directors of school districts located near the
  6 23 state boundaries to designate schools of equivalent standing
  6 24 across the state line for attendance of pupils, to establish
  6 25 reciprocal agreements between such districts, and to establish
  6 26 tuition and transportation fees in an amount acceptable to the
  6 27 affected boards.
  6 28    Currently, Code section 282.8 provides that tuition and
  6 29 transportation fees shall not be less than the lower average
  6 30 cost per pupil for the previous school year of the two
  6 31 affected school districts.  The bill amends the provision to
  6 32 establish that the tuition fee for students not requiring
  6 33 special education shall not be less than the lower of the
  6 34 tuition fee established pursuant to Code section 282.24 for
  6 35 students attending school outside the district of residence or
  7  1 the equivalent tuition rate for the non=Iowa school district
  7  2 for the previous school year, and the transportation fee
  7  3 established shall not be less than the lower average cost per
  7  4 mile for yellow school buses for the previous school year of
  7  5 the two affected school districts.  The bill also provides that
  7  6 if the tuition fee for the school district in the adjoining
  7  7 state is a variable rate, the test of which tuition fee is
  7  8 lower shall be determined for each student. For students
  7  9 requiring special education, the bill provides that the tuition
  7 10 fee shall be equal to the actual cost of the special education
  7 11 instructional program provided to that child under the child's
  7 12 individualized education program.
  7 13    If there is no agreement between districts, or if the
  7 14 distance requirements are not met, the bill provides that the
  7 15 tuition limitations of Code section 282.1 shall not apply,
  7 16 and a student attending school in the other state shall not
  7 17 be treated as a pupil of the district of residence in Iowa
  7 18 for purposes of tuition payments to the receiving district
  7 19 or for purposes of the school aid formula.  The bill further
  7 20 establishes that an agreement reached under Code section 282.8
  7 21 does not qualify as a whole grade sharing agreement and the
  7 22 open enrollment provisions do not apply to such an agreement.
  7 23    WHOLE GRADE SHARING AGREEMENTS.  Whole grade sharing
  7 24 is a procedure used by school districts in which all or a
  7 25 substantial portion of the pupils in any grade in two or
  7 26 more school districts share an educational program for all
  7 27 or a substantial portion of a school day under a written
  7 28 agreement.  Currently, the boards of the school districts
  7 29 participating in the agreement must negotiate, as part of
  7 30 the new or existing agreement, the disposition of funding
  7 31 provided under Code chapter 284, the student achievement and
  7 32 teacher quality program.  The bill provides exemptions from
  7 33 the disposition negotiation requirement relating to beginning
  7 34 teacher mentoring and induction funds; the teacher leadership
  7 35 supplement state cost per pupil, unless all of the districts
  8  1 subject to the agreement are receiving such funding; and the
  8  2 teacher leadership supplemental aid payments, unless all
  8  3 districts subject to the agreement are receiving such funding.
  8  4 Because the funding for the teacher leadership supplemental aid
  8  5 payments is scheduled to end with the 2016=2017 fiscal year,
  8  6 the bill repeals the relevant provision June 30, 2018.
  8  7    The bill also changes, from the third Friday of February to
  8  8 the second Friday of January of each year, the second of two
  8  9 dates used to determine the number of pupils participating in a
  8 10 whole grade sharing agreement.
  8 11    OPEN ENROLLMENT PAYMENTS.  In addition to other statutory
  8 12 requirements for open enrollment payments, the bill provides
  8 13 that the board of directors of the district of residence
  8 14 must pay to the receiving district the teacher leadership
  8 15 supplement state cost per pupil for the previous fiscal year
  8 16 or the teacher leadership supplement foundation aid for the
  8 17 previous fiscal year if both the district of residence and the
  8 18 receiving district are receiving such supplements.  Such a
  8 19 limitation currently exists in Code section 284.13, subsection
  8 20 1, paragraph "e", regarding the teacher leadership supplement
  8 21 foundation aid.  Currently, the district of residence must pay
  8 22 to the receiving district the teacher leadership supplement
  8 23 state cost per pupil for the previous fiscal year whether
  8 24 or not both districts are receiving the teacher leadership
  8 25 supplement state cost per pupil.
  8 26    Currently, a district of residence must make quarterly
  8 27 payments to the receiving district.  Under the bill, the
  8 28 receiving district must bill the district of residence
  8 29 biannually, and the district of residence must make payments
  8 30 in a timely manner.
  8 31    STATEWIDE PROGRESS REPORTS.  Currently, the department of
  8 32 education must make an annual report to the general assembly
  8 33 on statewide progress in student achievement on mathematics
  8 34 and reading at the fourth and eighth grades, on the evaluator
  8 35 training program, and on changes and improvements in teacher
  9  1 evaluations.  The bill eliminates that reporting requirement.
  9  2    STUDENT ACHIEVEMENT AND TEACHER QUALITY PROGRAM.  Currently,
  9  3 in developing administrative rules for consideration by the
  9  4 state board of education, the department must consult with
  9  5 persons representing teachers, administrators, school boards,
  9  6 approved practitioner preparation institutions, and other
  9  7 appropriate education stakeholders.  The bill provides that the
  9  8 department must consult stakeholders when those stakeholders
  9  9 might reasonably be affected by the proposed rule.
  9 10    TERMINOLOGY CHANGES.  Code sections 282.8 and 282.24 are
  9 11 amended to replace references to "elementary and high school"
  9 12 with the term "elementary and secondary school". Definitions
  9 13 for junior high school and high school are also stricken from
  9 14 Code section 282.24.
  9 15    REPEALS.  The bill repeals the following:
  9 16    1.  PILOT PROJECTS TO IMPROVE INSTRUCTIONAL PROGRAMS.  When
  9 17 first enacted in 1987, the provision was part of a program
  9 18 to offer incentives to school districts that established
  9 19 pilot projects to utilize a modified block schedule for
  9 20 offering classes in the districts and sharing the certificated
  9 21 instructional personnel.  Implementation by the department
  9 22 of education is dependent on whether the general assembly
  9 23 appropriates funding for the pilot projects.
  9 24    2.  TEACHER EXCHANGE PROGRAM.  The teacher exchange program
  9 25 was enacted in 1991, contingent on an appropriation of moneys
  9 26 by the general assembly, to permit school districts to exchange
  9 27 licensed instructional personnel with other districts in order
  9 28 to promote the exchange and enhancement of instructional
  9 29 methods and materials and encourage the educational development
  9 30 of Iowa's teachers.  The bill eliminates the provisions
  9 31 relating to the teacher exchange program, including provisions
  9 32 directing the state board to adopt rules to administer the
  9 33 program, directing the director of the department of education
  9 34 to administer the program, establishing the program, and
  9 35 providing for participation in the program by school districts
 10  1 and teachers.

  6 20    ATTENDING SCHOOL OUTSIDE THE STATE.  The bill makes a number
  6 21 of changes to Code section 282.8.  The Code section authorizes
  6 22 the boards of directors of school districts located near the

  6 28    Currently, Code section 282.8 provides that tuition and
  6 29 transportation fees shall not be less than the lower average
  6 30 cost per pupil for the previous school year of the two

  7  3 established shall not be less than the lower average cost per

  7  6 if the tuition fee for the school district in the adjoining
  7  7 state is a variable rate, the test of which tuition fee is

  7  9 requiring special education, the bill provides that the tuition
  7 10 fee shall be equal to the actual cost of the special education
  7 11 instructional program provided to that child under the child's
  7 12 individualized education program.
  7 13    If there is no agreement between districts, or if the
  7 14 distance requirements are not met, the bill provides that the
  7 15 tuition limitations of Code section 282.1 shall not apply,
  7 16 and a student attending school in the other state shall not
  7 17 be treated as a pupil of the district of residence in Iowa
  7 18 for purposes of tuition payments to the receiving district
  7 19 or for purposes of the school aid formula.  The bill further
  7 20 establishes that an agreement reached under Code section 282.8
  7 21 does not qualify as a whole grade sharing agreement and the
  7 22 open enrollment provisions do not apply to such an agreement.
  7 23    WHOLE GRADE SHARING AGREEMENTS.  Whole grade sharing
  7 24 is a procedure used by school districts in which all or a

  7 26 more school districts share an educational program for all
  7 27 or a substantial portion of a school day under a written

  7 29 participating in the agreement must negotiate, as part of
  7 30 the new or existing agreement, the disposition of funding
  7 31 provided under Code chapter 284, the student achievement and

  7 34 teacher mentoring and induction funds; the teacher leadership
  7 35 supplement state cost per pupil, unless all of the districts
  8  1 subject to the agreement are receiving such funding; and the
  8  2 teacher leadership supplemental aid payments, unless all
  8  3 districts subject to the agreement are receiving such funding.
  8  4 Because the funding for the teacher leadership supplemental aid
  8  5 payments is scheduled to end with the 2016=2017 fiscal year,
  8  6 the bill repeals the relevant provision June 30, 2018.
  8  7    The bill also changes, from the third Friday of February to
  8  8 the second Friday of January of each year, the second of two
  8  9 dates used to determine the number of pupils participating in a
  8 10 whole grade sharing agreement.
  8 11    OPEN ENROLLMENT PAYMENTS.  In addition to other statutory
  8 12 requirements for open enrollment payments, the bill provides
  8 13 that the board of directors of the district of residence
  8 14 must pay to the receiving district the teacher leadership
  8 15 supplement state cost per pupil for the previous fiscal year
  8 16 or the teacher leadership supplement foundation aid for the
  8 17 previous fiscal year if both the district of residence and the
  8 18 receiving district are receiving such supplements.  Such a
  8 19 limitation currently exists in Code section 284.13, subsection
  8 20 1, paragraph "e", regarding the teacher leadership supplement
  8 21 foundation aid.  Currently, the district of residence must pay
  8 22 to the receiving district the teacher leadership supplement
  8 23 state cost per pupil for the previous fiscal year whether
  8 24 or not both districts are receiving the teacher leadership
  8 25 supplement state cost per pupil.
  8 26    Currently, a district of residence must make quarterly
  8 27 payments to the receiving district.  Under the bill, the
  8 28 receiving district must bill the district of residence
  8 29 biannually, and the district of residence must make payments
  8 30 in a timely manner.
  8 31    STATEWIDE PROGRESS REPORTS.  Currently, the department of

  9 32 directing the state board to adopt rules to administer the
  9 33 program, directing the director of the department of education
  9 34 to administer the program, establishing the program, and
  9 35 providing for participation in the program by school districts

  5 34    This bill makes statutory changes affecting the duties and
  5 35 authority of the state board of education and the department of
  6  1 education, repeals certain programs, and modifies or eliminates
  6  2 provisions relating to certain programs and activities under
  6  3 the purview of the state board and the department.
  6  4    CERTAIN DIRECTOR'S DUTIES STRICKEN.  The bill strikes from
  6  5 Code section 256.9, which provides for the duties of the
  6  6 director of the department of education, provisions which
  6  7 require the director to cause to be printed in book form, every
  6  8 four years, all school laws in force and any amendments or
  6  9 changes in school laws, along with other information which may
  6 10 aid school officers; to develop a model written publications
  6 11 code for the regulation of time, place, and manner of student
  6 12 expression; and to submit to the general assembly an annual
  6 13 report regarding the activities, findings, and student progress
  6 14 under the core curriculum, as well as an annual report on the
  6 15 necessity of waiving statutory obligations for school districts
  6 16 in the event of a disaster.
  6 17    BUDGET GUARANTEE LANGUAGE.  The bill amends Code section
  6 18 257.14 to strike obsolete language relating to the budget
  6 19 guarantee.
  6 20    ATTENDING SCHOOL OUTSIDE THE STATE.  The bill makes a number
  6 21 of changes to Code section 282.8.  The Code section authorizes
  6 22 the boards of directors of school districts located near the
  6 23 state boundaries to designate schools of equivalent standing
  6 24 across the state line for attendance of pupils, to establish
  6 25 reciprocal agreements between such districts, and to establish
  6 26 tuition and transportation fees in an amount acceptable to the
  6 27 affected boards.
  6 28    Currently, Code section 282.8 provides that tuition and
  6 29 transportation fees shall not be less than the lower average
  6 30 cost per pupil for the previous school year of the two
  6 31 affected school districts.  The bill amends the provision to
  6 32 establish that the tuition fee for students not requiring
  6 33 special education shall not be less than the lower of the
  6 34 tuition fee established pursuant to Code section 282.24 for
  6 35 students attending school outside the district of residence or
  7  1 the equivalent tuition rate for the non=Iowa school district
  7  2 for the previous school year, and the transportation fee
  7  3 established shall not be less than the lower average cost per
  7  4 mile for yellow school buses for the previous school year of
  7  5 the two affected school districts.  The bill also provides that
  7  6 if the tuition fee for the school district in the adjoining
  7  7 state is a variable rate, the test of which tuition fee is
  7  8 lower shall be determined for each student. For students
  7  9 requiring special education, the bill provides that the tuition
  7 10 fee shall be equal to the actual cost of the special education
  7 11 instructional program provided to that child under the child's
  7 12 individualized education program.
  7 13    If there is no agreement between districts, or if the
  7 14 distance requirements are not met, the bill provides that the
  7 15 tuition limitations of Code section 282.1 shall not apply,
  7 16 and a student attending school in the other state shall not
  7 17 be treated as a pupil of the district of residence in Iowa
  7 18 for purposes of tuition payments to the receiving district
  7 19 or for purposes of the school aid formula.  The bill further
  7 20 establishes that an agreement reached under Code section 282.8
  7 21 does not qualify as a whole grade sharing agreement and the
  7 22 open enrollment provisions do not apply to such an agreement.
  7 23    WHOLE GRADE SHARING AGREEMENTS.  Whole grade sharing
  7 24 is a procedure used by school districts in which all or a
  7 25 substantial portion of the pupils in any grade in two or
  7 26 more school districts share an educational program for all
  7 27 or a substantial portion of a school day under a written
  7 28 agreement.  Currently, the boards of the school districts
  7 29 participating in the agreement must negotiate, as part of
  7 30 the new or existing agreement, the disposition of funding
  7 31 provided under Code chapter 284, the student achievement and
  7 32 teacher quality program.  The bill provides exemptions from
  7 33 the disposition negotiation requirement relating to beginning
  7 34 teacher mentoring and induction funds; the teacher leadership
  7 35 supplement state cost per pupil, unless all of the districts
  8  1 subject to the agreement are receiving such funding; and the
  8  2 teacher leadership supplemental aid payments, unless all
  8  3 districts subject to the agreement are receiving such funding.
  8  4 Because the funding for the teacher leadership supplemental aid
  8  5 payments is scheduled to end with the 2016=2017 fiscal year,
  8  6 the bill repeals the relevant provision June 30, 2018.
  8  7    The bill also changes, from the third Friday of February to
  8  8 the second Friday of January of each year, the second of two
  8  9 dates used to determine the number of pupils participating in a
  8 10 whole grade sharing agreement.
  8 11    OPEN ENROLLMENT PAYMENTS.  In addition to other statutory
  8 12 requirements for open enrollment payments, the bill provides
  8 13 that the board of directors of the district of residence
  8 14 must pay to the receiving district the teacher leadership
  8 15 supplement state cost per pupil for the previous fiscal year
  8 16 or the teacher leadership supplement foundation aid for the
  8 17 previous fiscal year if both the district of residence and the
  8 18 receiving district are receiving such supplements.  Such a
  8 19 limitation currently exists in Code section 284.13, subsection
  8 20 1, paragraph "e", regarding the teacher leadership supplement
  8 21 foundation aid.  Currently, the district of residence must pay
  8 22 to the receiving district the teacher leadership supplement
  8 23 state cost per pupil for the previous fiscal year whether
  8 24 or not both districts are receiving the teacher leadership
  8 25 supplement state cost per pupil.
  8 26    Currently, a district of residence must make quarterly
  8 27 payments to the receiving district.  Under the bill, the
  8 28 receiving district must bill the district of residence
  8 29 biannually, and the district of residence must make payments
  8 30 in a timely manner.
  8 31    STATEWIDE PROGRESS REPORTS.  Currently, the department of
  8 32 education must make an annual report to the general assembly
  8 33 on statewide progress in student achievement on mathematics
  8 34 and reading at the fourth and eighth grades, on the evaluator
  8 35 training program, and on changes and improvements in teacher
  9  1 evaluations.  The bill eliminates that reporting requirement.
  9  2    STUDENT ACHIEVEMENT AND TEACHER QUALITY PROGRAM.  Currently,
  9  3 in developing administrative rules for consideration by the
  9  4 state board of education, the department must consult with
  9  5 persons representing teachers, administrators, school boards,
  9  6 approved practitioner preparation institutions, and other
  9  7 appropriate education stakeholders.  The bill provides that the
  9  8 department must consult stakeholders when those stakeholders
  9  9 might reasonably be affected by the proposed rule.
  9 10    TERMINOLOGY CHANGES.  Code sections 282.8 and 282.24 are
  9 11 amended to replace references to "elementary and high school"
  9 12 with the term "elementary and secondary school". Definitions
  9 13 for junior high school and high school are also stricken from
  9 14 Code section 282.24.
  9 15    REPEALS.  The bill repeals the following:
  9 16    1.  PILOT PROJECTS TO IMPROVE INSTRUCTIONAL PROGRAMS.  When
  9 17 first enacted in 1987, the provision was part of a program
  9 18 to offer incentives to school districts that established
  9 19 pilot projects to utilize a modified block schedule for
  9 20 offering classes in the districts and sharing the certificated
  9 21 instructional personnel.  Implementation by the department
  9 22 of education is dependent on whether the general assembly
  9 23 appropriates funding for the pilot projects.
  9 24    2.  TEACHER EXCHANGE PROGRAM.  The teacher exchange program
  9 25 was enacted in 1991, contingent on an appropriation of moneys
  9 26 by the general assembly, to permit school districts to exchange
  9 27 licensed instructional personnel with other districts in order
  9 28 to promote the exchange and enhancement of instructional
  9 29 methods and materials and encourage the educational development
  9 30 of Iowa's teachers.  The bill eliminates the provisions
  9 31 relating to the teacher exchange program, including provisions
  9 32 directing the state board to adopt rules to administer the
  9 33 program, directing the director of the department of education
  9 34 to administer the program, establishing the program, and
  9 35 providing for participation in the program by school districts
 10  1 and teachers.

  6 28    Currently, Code section 282.8 provides that tuition and
  6 29 transportation fees shall not be less than the lower average
  6 30 cost per pupil for the previous school year of the two

  7  9 requiring special education, the bill provides that the tuition
  7 10 fee shall be equal to the actual cost of the special education

  7 12 individualized education program.
  7 13    If there is no agreement between districts, or if the
  7 14 distance requirements are not met, the bill provides that the
  7 15 tuition limitations of Code section 282.1 shall not apply,
  7 16 and a student attending school in the other state shall not
  7 17 be treated as a pupil of the district of residence in Iowa
  7 18 for purposes of tuition payments to the receiving district
  7 19 or for purposes of the school aid formula.  The bill further
  7 20 establishes that an agreement reached under Code section 282.8
  7 21 does not qualify as a whole grade sharing agreement and the

  7 29 participating in the agreement must negotiate, as part of
  7 30 the new or existing agreement, the disposition of funding
  7 31 provided under Code chapter 284, the student achievement and

  7 35 supplement state cost per pupil, unless all of the districts
  8  1 subject to the agreement are receiving such funding; and the
  8  2 teacher leadership supplemental aid payments, unless all
  8  3 districts subject to the agreement are receiving such funding.
  8  4 Because the funding for the teacher leadership supplemental aid
  8  5 payments is scheduled to end with the 2016=2017 fiscal year,
  8  6 the bill repeals the relevant provision June 30, 2018.
  8  7    The bill also changes, from the third Friday of February to

  8 12 requirements for open enrollment payments, the bill provides
  8 13 that the board of directors of the district of residence
  8 14 must pay to the receiving district the teacher leadership
  8 15 supplement state cost per pupil for the previous fiscal year
  8 16 or the teacher leadership supplement foundation aid for the
  8 17 previous fiscal year if both the district of residence and the
  8 18 receiving district are receiving such supplements.  Such a
  8 19 limitation currently exists in Code section 284.13, subsection
  8 20 1, paragraph "e", regarding the teacher leadership supplement
  8 21 foundation aid.  Currently, the district of residence must pay
  8 22 to the receiving district the teacher leadership supplement
  8 23 state cost per pupil for the previous fiscal year whether
  8 24 or not both districts are receiving the teacher leadership
  8 25 supplement state cost per pupil.
  8 26    Currently, a district of residence must make quarterly

  9 32 directing the state board to adopt rules to administer the
  9 33 program, directing the director of the department of education
  9 34 to administer the program, establishing the program, and
  9 35 providing for participation in the program by school districts

  6  3 the purview of the state board and the department.
  6  4    CERTAIN DIRECTOR'S DUTIES STRICKEN.  The bill strikes from
  6  5 Code section 256.9, which provides for the duties of the
  6  6 director of the department of education, provisions which
  6  7 require the director to cause to be printed in book form, every
  6  8 four years, all school laws in force and any amendments or
  6  9 changes in school laws, along with other information which may
  6 10 aid school officers; to develop a model written publications
  6 11 code for the regulation of time, place, and manner of student
  6 12 expression; and to submit to the general assembly an annual
  6 13 report regarding the activities, findings, and student progress
  6 14 under the core curriculum, as well as an annual report on the
  6 15 necessity of waiving statutory obligations for school districts
  6 16 in the event of a disaster.
  6 17    BUDGET GUARANTEE LANGUAGE.  The bill amends Code section
  6 18 257.14 to strike obsolete language relating to the budget
  6 19 guarantee.
  6 20    ATTENDING SCHOOL OUTSIDE THE STATE.  The bill makes a number
  6 21 of changes to Code section 282.8.  The Code section authorizes
  6 22 the boards of directors of school districts located near the
  6 23 state boundaries to designate schools of equivalent standing
  6 24 across the state line for attendance of pupils, to establish
  6 25 reciprocal agreements between such districts, and to establish
  6 26 tuition and transportation fees in an amount acceptable to the
  6 27 affected boards.
  6 28    Currently, Code section 282.8 provides that tuition and
  6 29 transportation fees shall not be less than the lower average
  6 30 cost per pupil for the previous school year of the two
  6 31 affected school districts.  The bill amends the provision to
  6 32 establish that the tuition fee for students not requiring
  6 33 special education shall not be less than the lower of the
  6 34 tuition fee established pursuant to Code section 282.24 for
  6 35 students attending school outside the district of residence or
  7  1 the equivalent tuition rate for the non=Iowa school district
  7  2 for the previous school year, and the transportation fee
  7  3 established shall not be less than the lower average cost per
  7  4 mile for yellow school buses for the previous school year of
  7  5 the two affected school districts.  The bill also provides that
  7  6 if the tuition fee for the school district in the adjoining
  7  7 state is a variable rate, the test of which tuition fee is
  7  8 lower shall be determined for each student. For students
  7  9 requiring special education, the bill provides that the tuition
  7 10 fee shall be equal to the actual cost of the special education
  7 11 instructional program provided to that child under the child's
  7 12 individualized education program.
  7 13    If there is no agreement between districts, or if the
  7 14 distance requirements are not met, the bill provides that the
  7 15 tuition limitations of Code section 282.1 shall not apply,
  7 16 and a student attending school in the other state shall not
  7 17 be treated as a pupil of the district of residence in Iowa
  7 18 for purposes of tuition payments to the receiving district
  7 19 or for purposes of the school aid formula.  The bill further
  7 20 establishes that an agreement reached under Code section 282.8
  7 21 does not qualify as a whole grade sharing agreement and the
  7 22 open enrollment provisions do not apply to such an agreement.
  7 23    WHOLE GRADE SHARING AGREEMENTS.  Whole grade sharing
  7 24 is a procedure used by school districts in which all or a
  7 25 substantial portion of the pupils in any grade in two or
  7 26 more school districts share an educational program for all
  7 27 or a substantial portion of a school day under a written
  7 28 agreement.  Currently, the boards of the school districts
  7 29 participating in the agreement must negotiate, as part of
  7 30 the new or existing agreement, the disposition of funding
  7 31 provided under Code chapter 284, the student achievement and
  7 32 teacher quality program.  The bill provides exemptions from
  7 33 the disposition negotiation requirement relating to beginning
  7 34 teacher mentoring and induction funds; the teacher leadership
  7 35 supplement state cost per pupil, unless all of the districts
  8  1 subject to the agreement are receiving such funding; and the
  8  2 teacher leadership supplemental aid payments, unless all
  8  3 districts subject to the agreement are receiving such funding.
  8  4 Because the funding for the teacher leadership supplemental aid
  8  5 payments is scheduled to end with the 2016=2017 fiscal year,
  8  6 the bill repeals the relevant provision June 30, 2018.
  8  7    The bill also changes, from the third Friday of February to
  8  8 the second Friday of January of each year, the second of two
  8  9 dates used to determine the number of pupils participating in a
  8 10 whole grade sharing agreement.
  8 11    OPEN ENROLLMENT PAYMENTS.  In addition to other statutory
  8 12 requirements for open enrollment payments, the bill provides
  8 13 that the board of directors of the district of residence
  8 14 must pay to the receiving district the teacher leadership
  8 15 supplement state cost per pupil for the previous fiscal year
  8 16 or the teacher leadership supplement foundation aid for the
  8 17 previous fiscal year if both the district of residence and the
  8 18 receiving district are receiving such supplements.  Such a
  8 19 limitation currently exists in Code section 284.13, subsection
  8 20 1, paragraph "e", regarding the teacher leadership supplement
  8 21 foundation aid.  Currently, the district of residence must pay
  8 22 to the receiving district the teacher leadership supplement
  8 23 state cost per pupil for the previous fiscal year whether
  8 24 or not both districts are receiving the teacher leadership
  8 25 supplement state cost per pupil.
  8 26    Currently, a district of residence must make quarterly
  8 27 payments to the receiving district.  Under the bill, the
  8 28 receiving district must bill the district of residence
  8 29 biannually, and the district of residence must make payments
  8 30 in a timely manner.
  8 31    STATEWIDE PROGRESS REPORTS.  Currently, the department of
  8 32 education must make an annual report to the general assembly
  8 33 on statewide progress in student achievement on mathematics
  8 34 and reading at the fourth and eighth grades, on the evaluator
  8 35 training program, and on changes and improvements in teacher
  9  1 evaluations.  The bill eliminates that reporting requirement.
  9  2    STUDENT ACHIEVEMENT AND TEACHER QUALITY PROGRAM.  Currently,
  9  3 in developing administrative rules for consideration by the
  9  4 state board of education, the department must consult with
  9  5 persons representing teachers, administrators, school boards,
  9  6 approved practitioner preparation institutions, and other
  9  7 appropriate education stakeholders.  The bill provides that the
  9  8 department must consult stakeholders when those stakeholders
  9  9 might reasonably be affected by the proposed rule.
  9 10    TERMINOLOGY CHANGES.  Code sections 282.8 and 282.24 are
  9 11 amended to replace references to "elementary and high school"
  9 12 with the term "elementary and secondary school". Definitions
  9 13 for junior high school and high school are also stricken from
  9 14 Code section 282.24.
  9 15    REPEALS.  The bill repeals the following:
  9 16    1.  PILOT PROJECTS TO IMPROVE INSTRUCTIONAL PROGRAMS.  When
  9 17 first enacted in 1987, the provision was part of a program
  9 18 to offer incentives to school districts that established
  9 19 pilot projects to utilize a modified block schedule for
  9 20 offering classes in the districts and sharing the certificated
  9 21 instructional personnel.  Implementation by the department
  9 22 of education is dependent on whether the general assembly
  9 23 appropriates funding for the pilot projects.
  9 24    2.  TEACHER EXCHANGE PROGRAM.  The teacher exchange program
  9 25 was enacted in 1991, contingent on an appropriation of moneys
  9 26 by the general assembly, to permit school districts to exchange
  9 27 licensed instructional personnel with other districts in order
  9 28 to promote the exchange and enhancement of instructional
  9 29 methods and materials and encourage the educational development
  9 30 of Iowa's teachers.  The bill eliminates the provisions
  9 31 relating to the teacher exchange program, including provisions
  9 32 directing the state board to adopt rules to administer the
  9 33 program, directing the director of the department of education
  9 34 to administer the program, establishing the program, and
  9 35 providing for participation in the program by school districts

  6 20    ATTENDING SCHOOL OUTSIDE THE STATE.  The bill makes a number
  6 21 of changes to Code section 282.8.  The Code section authorizes

  6 24 across the state line for attendance of pupils, to establish
  6 25 reciprocal agreements between such districts, and to establish
  6 26 tuition and transportation fees in an amount acceptable to the
  6 27 affected boards.
  6 28    Currently, Code section 282.8 provides that tuition and
  6 29 transportation fees shall not be less than the lower average
  6 30 cost per pupil for the previous school year of the two
  6 31 affected school districts.  The bill amends the provision to
  6 32 establish that the tuition fee for students not requiring
  6 33 special education shall not be less than the lower of the

  6 35 students attending school outside the district of residence or
  7  1 the equivalent tuition rate for the non=Iowa school district

  7  3 established shall not be less than the lower average cost per

  7  5 the two affected school districts.  The bill also provides that
  7  6 if the tuition fee for the school district in the adjoining
  7  7 state is a variable rate, the test of which tuition fee is

  7  9 requiring special education, the bill provides that the tuition
  7 10 fee shall be equal to the actual cost of the special education
  7 11 instructional program provided to that child under the child's
  7 12 individualized education program.
  7 13    If there is no agreement between districts, or if the
  7 14 distance requirements are not met, the bill provides that the
  7 15 tuition limitations of Code section 282.1 shall not apply,
  7 16 and a student attending school in the other state shall not
  7 17 be treated as a pupil of the district of residence in Iowa
  7 18 for purposes of tuition payments to the receiving district
  7 19 or for purposes of the school aid formula.  The bill further
  7 20 establishes that an agreement reached under Code section 282.8
  7 21 does not qualify as a whole grade sharing agreement and the
  7 22 open enrollment provisions do not apply to such an agreement.
  7 23    WHOLE GRADE SHARING AGREEMENTS.  Whole grade sharing
  7 24 is a procedure used by school districts in which all or a
  7 25 substantial portion of the pupils in any grade in two or
  7 26 more school districts share an educational program for all
  7 27 or a substantial portion of a school day under a written
  7 28 agreement.  Currently, the boards of the school districts
  7 29 participating in the agreement must negotiate, as part of
  7 30 the new or existing agreement, the disposition of funding
  7 31 provided under Code chapter 284, the student achievement and
  7 32 teacher quality program.  The bill provides exemptions from
  7 33 the disposition negotiation requirement relating to beginning
  7 34 teacher mentoring and induction funds; the teacher leadership
  7 35 supplement state cost per pupil, unless all of the districts
  8  1 subject to the agreement are receiving such funding; and the
  8  2 teacher leadership supplemental aid payments, unless all
  8  3 districts subject to the agreement are receiving such funding.
  8  4 Because the funding for the teacher leadership supplemental aid
  8  5 payments is scheduled to end with the 2016=2017 fiscal year,
  8  6 the bill repeals the relevant provision June 30, 2018.
  8  7    The bill also changes, from the third Friday of February to
  8  8 the second Friday of January of each year, the second of two
  8  9 dates used to determine the number of pupils participating in a
  8 10 whole grade sharing agreement.
  8 11    OPEN ENROLLMENT PAYMENTS.  In addition to other statutory
  8 12 requirements for open enrollment payments, the bill provides
  8 13 that the board of directors of the district of residence
  8 14 must pay to the receiving district the teacher leadership
  8 15 supplement state cost per pupil for the previous fiscal year
  8 16 or the teacher leadership supplement foundation aid for the
  8 17 previous fiscal year if both the district of residence and the
  8 18 receiving district are receiving such supplements.  Such a
  8 19 limitation currently exists in Code section 284.13, subsection
  8 20 1, paragraph "e", regarding the teacher leadership supplement
  8 21 foundation aid.  Currently, the district of residence must pay
  8 22 to the receiving district the teacher leadership supplement
  8 23 state cost per pupil for the previous fiscal year whether
  8 24 or not both districts are receiving the teacher leadership
  8 25 supplement state cost per pupil.
  8 26    Currently, a district of residence must make quarterly
  8 27 payments to the receiving district.  Under the bill, the
  8 28 receiving district must bill the district of residence
  8 29 biannually, and the district of residence must make payments

  6  8 four years, all school laws in force and any amendments or
  6  9 changes in school laws, along with other information which may
  6 10 aid school officers; to develop a model written publications
  6 11 code for the regulation of time, place, and manner of student
  6 12 expression; and to submit to the general assembly an annual
  6 13 report regarding the activities, findings, and student progress
  6 14 under the core curriculum, as well as an annual report on the
  6 15 necessity of waiving statutory obligations for school districts
  6 16 in the event of a disaster.
  6 17    BUDGET GUARANTEE LANGUAGE.  The bill amends Code section
  6 18 257.14 to strike obsolete language relating to the budget
  6 19 guarantee.
  6 20    ATTENDING SCHOOL OUTSIDE THE STATE.  The bill makes a number
  6 21 of changes to Code section 282.8.  The Code section authorizes
  6 22 the boards of directors of school districts located near the
  6 23 state boundaries to designate schools of equivalent standing
  6 24 across the state line for attendance of pupils, to establish
  6 25 reciprocal agreements between such districts, and to establish
  6 26 tuition and transportation fees in an amount acceptable to the
  6 27 affected boards.
  6 28    Currently, Code section 282.8 provides that tuition and
  6 29 transportation fees shall not be less than the lower average
  6 30 cost per pupil for the previous school year of the two
  6 31 affected school districts.  The bill amends the provision to
  6 32 establish that the tuition fee for students not requiring
  6 33 special education shall not be less than the lower of the
  6 34 tuition fee established pursuant to Code section 282.24 for
  6 35 students attending school outside the district of residence or
  7  1 the equivalent tuition rate for the non=Iowa school district
  7  2 for the previous school year, and the transportation fee
  7  3 established shall not be less than the lower average cost per
  7  4 mile for yellow school buses for the previous school year of
  7  5 the two affected school districts.  The bill also provides that
  7  6 if the tuition fee for the school district in the adjoining
  7  7 state is a variable rate, the test of which tuition fee is
  7  8 lower shall be determined for each student. For students
  7  9 requiring special education, the bill provides that the tuition
  7 10 fee shall be equal to the actual cost of the special education
  7 11 instructional program provided to that child under the child's
  7 12 individualized education program.
  7 13    If there is no agreement between districts, or if the
  7 14 distance requirements are not met, the bill provides that the
  7 15 tuition limitations of Code section 282.1 shall not apply,
  7 16 and a student attending school in the other state shall not
  7 17 be treated as a pupil of the district of residence in Iowa
  7 18 for purposes of tuition payments to the receiving district
  7 19 or for purposes of the school aid formula.  The bill further
  7 20 establishes that an agreement reached under Code section 282.8
  7 21 does not qualify as a whole grade sharing agreement and the
  7 22 open enrollment provisions do not apply to such an agreement.
  7 23    WHOLE GRADE SHARING AGREEMENTS.  Whole grade sharing
  7 24 is a procedure used by school districts in which all or a
  7 25 substantial portion of the pupils in any grade in two or
  7 26 more school districts share an educational program for all
  7 27 or a substantial portion of a school day under a written
  7 28 agreement.  Currently, the boards of the school districts
  7 29 participating in the agreement must negotiate, as part of
  7 30 the new or existing agreement, the disposition of funding
  7 31 provided under Code chapter 284, the student achievement and
  7 32 teacher quality program.  The bill provides exemptions from
  7 33 the disposition negotiation requirement relating to beginning
  7 34 teacher mentoring and induction funds; the teacher leadership
  7 35 supplement state cost per pupil, unless all of the districts
  8  1 subject to the agreement are receiving such funding; and the
  8  2 teacher leadership supplemental aid payments, unless all
  8  3 districts subject to the agreement are receiving such funding.
  8  4 Because the funding for the teacher leadership supplemental aid
  8  5 payments is scheduled to end with the 2016=2017 fiscal year,
  8  6 the bill repeals the relevant provision June 30, 2018.
  8  7    The bill also changes, from the third Friday of February to
  8  8 the second Friday of January of each year, the second of two
  8  9 dates used to determine the number of pupils participating in a
  8 10 whole grade sharing agreement.
  8 11    OPEN ENROLLMENT PAYMENTS.  In addition to other statutory
  8 12 requirements for open enrollment payments, the bill provides
  8 13 that the board of directors of the district of residence
  8 14 must pay to the receiving district the teacher leadership
  8 15 supplement state cost per pupil for the previous fiscal year
  8 16 or the teacher leadership supplement foundation aid for the
  8 17 previous fiscal year if both the district of residence and the
  8 18 receiving district are receiving such supplements.  Such a
  8 19 limitation currently exists in Code section 284.13, subsection
  8 20 1, paragraph "e", regarding the teacher leadership supplement
  8 21 foundation aid.  Currently, the district of residence must pay
  8 22 to the receiving district the teacher leadership supplement
  8 23 state cost per pupil for the previous fiscal year whether
  8 24 or not both districts are receiving the teacher leadership
  8 25 supplement state cost per pupil.
  8 26    Currently, a district of residence must make quarterly
  8 27 payments to the receiving district.  Under the bill, the
  8 28 receiving district must bill the district of residence
  8 29 biannually, and the district of residence must make payments
  8 30 in a timely manner.
  8 31    STATEWIDE PROGRESS REPORTS.  Currently, the department of
  8 32 education must make an annual report to the general assembly
  8 33 on statewide progress in student achievement on mathematics
  8 34 and reading at the fourth and eighth grades, on the evaluator
  8 35 training program, and on changes and improvements in teacher
  9  1 evaluations.  The bill eliminates that reporting requirement.
  9  2    STUDENT ACHIEVEMENT AND TEACHER QUALITY PROGRAM.  Currently,
  9  3 in developing administrative rules for consideration by the
  9  4 state board of education, the department must consult with
  9  5 persons representing teachers, administrators, school boards,
  9  6 approved practitioner preparation institutions, and other
  9  7 appropriate education stakeholders.  The bill provides that the
  9  8 department must consult stakeholders when those stakeholders
  9  9 might reasonably be affected by the proposed rule.
  9 10    TERMINOLOGY CHANGES.  Code sections 282.8 and 282.24 are
  9 11 amended to replace references to "elementary and high school"
  9 12 with the term "elementary and secondary school". Definitions
  9 13 for junior high school and high school are also stricken from
  9 14 Code section 282.24.
  9 15    REPEALS.  The bill repeals the following:
  9 16    1.  PILOT PROJECTS TO IMPROVE INSTRUCTIONAL PROGRAMS.  When
  9 17 first enacted in 1987, the provision was part of a program
  9 18 to offer incentives to school districts that established
  9 19 pilot projects to utilize a modified block schedule for
  9 20 offering classes in the districts and sharing the certificated
  9 21 instructional personnel.  Implementation by the department
  9 22 of education is dependent on whether the general assembly
  9 23 appropriates funding for the pilot projects.
  9 24    2.  TEACHER EXCHANGE PROGRAM.  The teacher exchange program
  9 25 was enacted in 1991, contingent on an appropriation of moneys
  9 26 by the general assembly, to permit school districts to exchange
  9 27 licensed instructional personnel with other districts in order
  9 28 to promote the exchange and enhancement of instructional
  9 29 methods and materials and encourage the educational development
  9 30 of Iowa's teachers.  The bill eliminates the provisions
  9 31 relating to the teacher exchange program, including provisions
  9 32 directing the state board to adopt rules to administer the
  9 33 program, directing the director of the department of education
  9 34 to administer the program, establishing the program, and
  9 35 providing for participation in the program by school districts
 10  1 and teachers.

  8 23 state cost per pupil for the previous fiscal year whether
  8 24 or not both districts are receiving the teacher leadership

  8 26    Currently, a district of residence must make quarterly

  6 31 affected school districts.  The bill amends the provision to
  6 32 establish that the tuition fee for students not requiring
  6 33 special education shall not be less than the lower of the
  6 34 tuition fee established pursuant to Code section 282.24 for
  6 35 students attending school outside the district of residence or
  7  1 the equivalent tuition rate for the non=Iowa school district
  7  2 for the previous school year, and the transportation fee
  7  3 established shall not be less than the lower average cost per
  7  4 mile for yellow school buses for the previous school year of
  7  5 the two affected school districts.  The bill also provides that
  7  6 if the tuition fee for the school district in the adjoining
  7  7 state is a variable rate, the test of which tuition fee is
  7  8 lower shall be determined for each student. For students
  7  9 requiring special education, the bill provides that the tuition
  7 10 fee shall be equal to the actual cost of the special education
  7 11 instructional program provided to that child under the child's
  7 12 individualized education program.
  7 13    If there is no agreement between districts, or if the
  7 14 distance requirements are not met, the bill provides that the
  7 15 tuition limitations of Code section 282.1 shall not apply,
  7 16 and a student attending school in the other state shall not
  7 17 be treated as a pupil of the district of residence in Iowa
  7 18 for purposes of tuition payments to the receiving district
  7 19 or for purposes of the school aid formula.  The bill further
  7 20 establishes that an agreement reached under Code section 282.8
  7 21 does not qualify as a whole grade sharing agreement and the
  7 22 open enrollment provisions do not apply to such an agreement.
  7 23    WHOLE GRADE SHARING AGREEMENTS.  Whole grade sharing
  7 24 is a procedure used by school districts in which all or a
  7 25 substantial portion of the pupils in any grade in two or
  7 26 more school districts share an educational program for all
  7 27 or a substantial portion of a school day under a written
  7 28 agreement.  Currently, the boards of the school districts
  7 29 participating in the agreement must negotiate, as part of
  7 30 the new or existing agreement, the disposition of funding
  7 31 provided under Code chapter 284, the student achievement and
  7 32 teacher quality program.  The bill provides exemptions from
  7 33 the disposition negotiation requirement relating to beginning
  7 34 teacher mentoring and induction funds; the teacher leadership
  7 35 supplement state cost per pupil, unless all of the districts
  8  1 subject to the agreement are receiving such funding; and the
  8  2 teacher leadership supplemental aid payments, unless all
  8  3 districts subject to the agreement are receiving such funding.
  8  4 Because the funding for the teacher leadership supplemental aid
  8  5 payments is scheduled to end with the 2016=2017 fiscal year,
  8  6 the bill repeals the relevant provision June 30, 2018.
  8  7    The bill also changes, from the third Friday of February to
  8  8 the second Friday of January of each year, the second of two
  8  9 dates used to determine the number of pupils participating in a
  8 10 whole grade sharing agreement.
  8 11    OPEN ENROLLMENT PAYMENTS.  In addition to other statutory
  8 12 requirements for open enrollment payments, the bill provides
  8 13 that the board of directors of the district of residence
  8 14 must pay to the receiving district the teacher leadership
  8 15 supplement state cost per pupil for the previous fiscal year
  8 16 or the teacher leadership supplement foundation aid for the
  8 17 previous fiscal year if both the district of residence and the
  8 18 receiving district are receiving such supplements.  Such a
  8 19 limitation currently exists in Code section 284.13, subsection
  8 20 1, paragraph "e", regarding the teacher leadership supplement
  8 21 foundation aid.  Currently, the district of residence must pay
  8 22 to the receiving district the teacher leadership supplement
  8 23 state cost per pupil for the previous fiscal year whether
  8 24 or not both districts are receiving the teacher leadership
  8 25 supplement state cost per pupil.
  8 26    Currently, a district of residence must make quarterly
  8 27 payments to the receiving district.  Under the bill, the
  8 28 receiving district must bill the district of residence
  8 29 biannually, and the district of residence must make payments
  8 30 in a timely manner.
  8 31    STATEWIDE PROGRESS REPORTS.  Currently, the department of
  8 32 education must make an annual report to the general assembly
  8 33 on statewide progress in student achievement on mathematics
  8 34 and reading at the fourth and eighth grades, on the evaluator
  8 35 training program, and on changes and improvements in teacher
  9  1 evaluations.  The bill eliminates that reporting requirement.
  9  2    STUDENT ACHIEVEMENT AND TEACHER QUALITY PROGRAM.  Currently,
  9  3 in developing administrative rules for consideration by the
  9  4 state board of education, the department must consult with
  9  5 persons representing teachers, administrators, school boards,
  9  6 approved practitioner preparation institutions, and other
  9  7 appropriate education stakeholders.  The bill provides that the
  9  8 department must consult stakeholders when those stakeholders
  9  9 might reasonably be affected by the proposed rule.
  9 10    TERMINOLOGY CHANGES.  Code sections 282.8 and 282.24 are
  9 11 amended to replace references to "elementary and high school"
  9 12 with the term "elementary and secondary school". Definitions
  9 13 for junior high school and high school are also stricken from
  9 14 Code section 282.24.
  9 15    REPEALS.  The bill repeals the following:
  9 16    1.  PILOT PROJECTS TO IMPROVE INSTRUCTIONAL PROGRAMS.  When
  9 17 first enacted in 1987, the provision was part of a program
  9 18 to offer incentives to school districts that established
  9 19 pilot projects to utilize a modified block schedule for
  9 20 offering classes in the districts and sharing the certificated
  9 21 instructional personnel.  Implementation by the department
  9 22 of education is dependent on whether the general assembly
  9 23 appropriates funding for the pilot projects.
  9 24    2.  TEACHER EXCHANGE PROGRAM.  The teacher exchange program
  9 25 was enacted in 1991, contingent on an appropriation of moneys
  9 26 by the general assembly, to permit school districts to exchange
  9 27 licensed instructional personnel with other districts in order
  9 28 to promote the exchange and enhancement of instructional
  9 29 methods and materials and encourage the educational development
  9 30 of Iowa's teachers.  The bill eliminates the provisions
  9 31 relating to the teacher exchange program, including provisions
  9 32 directing the state board to adopt rules to administer the
  9 33 program, directing the director of the department of education
  9 34 to administer the program, establishing the program, and
  9 35 providing for participation in the program by school districts
 10  1 and teachers.

  6 13 report regarding the activities, findings, and student progress
  6 14 under the core curriculum, as well as an annual report on the
  6 15 necessity of waiving statutory obligations for school districts
  6 16 in the event of a disaster.
  6 17    BUDGET GUARANTEE LANGUAGE.  The bill amends Code section
  6 18 257.14 to strike obsolete language relating to the budget
  6 19 guarantee.
  6 20    ATTENDING SCHOOL OUTSIDE THE STATE.  The bill makes a number
  6 21 of changes to Code section 282.8.  The Code section authorizes
  6 22 the boards of directors of school districts located near the
  6 23 state boundaries to designate schools of equivalent standing
  6 24 across the state line for attendance of pupils, to establish
  6 25 reciprocal agreements between such districts, and to establish
  6 26 tuition and transportation fees in an amount acceptable to the
  6 27 affected boards.
  6 28    Currently, Code section 282.8 provides that tuition and
  6 29 transportation fees shall not be less than the lower average
  6 30 cost per pupil for the previous school year of the two
  6 31 affected school districts.  The bill amends the provision to
  6 32 establish that the tuition fee for students not requiring
  6 33 special education shall not be less than the lower of the
  6 34 tuition fee established pursuant to Code section 282.24 for
  6 35 students attending school outside the district of residence or
  7  1 the equivalent tuition rate for the non=Iowa school district
  7  2 for the previous school year, and the transportation fee
  7  3 established shall not be less than the lower average cost per
  7  4 mile for yellow school buses for the previous school year of
  7  5 the two affected school districts.  The bill also provides that
  7  6 if the tuition fee for the school district in the adjoining
  7  7 state is a variable rate, the test of which tuition fee is
  7  8 lower shall be determined for each student. For students
  7  9 requiring special education, the bill provides that the tuition
  7 10 fee shall be equal to the actual cost of the special education
  7 11 instructional program provided to that child under the child's
  7 12 individualized education program.
  7 13    If there is no agreement between districts, or if the
  7 14 distance requirements are not met, the bill provides that the
  7 15 tuition limitations of Code section 282.1 shall not apply,
  7 16 and a student attending school in the other state shall not
  7 17 be treated as a pupil of the district of residence in Iowa
  7 18 for purposes of tuition payments to the receiving district
  7 19 or for purposes of the school aid formula.  The bill further
  7 20 establishes that an agreement reached under Code section 282.8
  7 21 does not qualify as a whole grade sharing agreement and the
  7 22 open enrollment provisions do not apply to such an agreement.
  7 23    WHOLE GRADE SHARING AGREEMENTS.  Whole grade sharing
  7 24 is a procedure used by school districts in which all or a
  7 25 substantial portion of the pupils in any grade in two or
  7 26 more school districts share an educational program for all
  7 27 or a substantial portion of a school day under a written
  7 28 agreement.  Currently, the boards of the school districts
  7 29 participating in the agreement must negotiate, as part of
  7 30 the new or existing agreement, the disposition of funding
  7 31 provided under Code chapter 284, the student achievement and
  7 32 teacher quality program.  The bill provides exemptions from
  7 33 the disposition negotiation requirement relating to beginning
  7 34 teacher mentoring and induction funds; the teacher leadership
  7 35 supplement state cost per pupil, unless all of the districts
  8  1 subject to the agreement are receiving such funding; and the
  8  2 teacher leadership supplemental aid payments, unless all
  8  3 districts subject to the agreement are receiving such funding.
  8  4 Because the funding for the teacher leadership supplemental aid
  8  5 payments is scheduled to end with the 2016=2017 fiscal year,
  8  6 the bill repeals the relevant provision June 30, 2018.
  8  7    The bill also changes, from the third Friday of February to
  8  8 the second Friday of January of each year, the second of two
  8  9 dates used to determine the number of pupils participating in a
  8 10 whole grade sharing agreement.
  8 11    OPEN ENROLLMENT PAYMENTS.  In addition to other statutory
  8 12 requirements for open enrollment payments, the bill provides
  8 13 that the board of directors of the district of residence
  8 14 must pay to the receiving district the teacher leadership
  8 15 supplement state cost per pupil for the previous fiscal year
  8 16 or the teacher leadership supplement foundation aid for the
  8 17 previous fiscal year if both the district of residence and the
  8 18 receiving district are receiving such supplements.  Such a
  8 19 limitation currently exists in Code section 284.13, subsection
  8 20 1, paragraph "e", regarding the teacher leadership supplement
  8 21 foundation aid.  Currently, the district of residence must pay
  8 22 to the receiving district the teacher leadership supplement
  8 23 state cost per pupil for the previous fiscal year whether
  8 24 or not both districts are receiving the teacher leadership
  8 25 supplement state cost per pupil.
  8 26    Currently, a district of residence must make quarterly
  8 27 payments to the receiving district.  Under the bill, the
  8 28 receiving district must bill the district of residence
  8 29 biannually, and the district of residence must make payments
  8 30 in a timely manner.
  8 31    STATEWIDE PROGRESS REPORTS.  Currently, the department of
  8 32 education must make an annual report to the general assembly
  8 33 on statewide progress in student achievement on mathematics
  8 34 and reading at the fourth and eighth grades, on the evaluator
  8 35 training program, and on changes and improvements in teacher
  9  1 evaluations.  The bill eliminates that reporting requirement.
  9  2    STUDENT ACHIEVEMENT AND TEACHER QUALITY PROGRAM.  Currently,
  9  3 in developing administrative rules for consideration by the
  9  4 state board of education, the department must consult with
  9  5 persons representing teachers, administrators, school boards,
  9  6 approved practitioner preparation institutions, and other
  9  7 appropriate education stakeholders.  The bill provides that the
  9  8 department must consult stakeholders when those stakeholders
  9  9 might reasonably be affected by the proposed rule.
  9 10    TERMINOLOGY CHANGES.  Code sections 282.8 and 282.24 are
  9 11 amended to replace references to "elementary and high school"
  9 12 with the term "elementary and secondary school". Definitions
  9 13 for junior high school and high school are also stricken from
  9 14 Code section 282.24.

  6 20    ATTENDING SCHOOL OUTSIDE THE STATE.  The bill makes a number
  6 21 of changes to Code section 282.8.  The Code section authorizes
  6 22 the boards of directors of school districts located near the
  6 23 state boundaries to designate schools of equivalent standing
  6 24 across the state line for attendance of pupils, to establish

  6 34 tuition fee established pursuant to Code section 282.24 for
  6 35 students attending school outside the district of residence or
  7  1 the equivalent tuition rate for the non=Iowa school district
  7  2 for the previous school year, and the transportation fee
  7  3 established shall not be less than the lower average cost per
  7  4 mile for yellow school buses for the previous school year of
  7  5 the two affected school districts.  The bill also provides that
  7  6 if the tuition fee for the school district in the adjoining
  7  7 state is a variable rate, the test of which tuition fee is
  7  8 lower shall be determined for each student. For students
  7  9 requiring special education, the bill provides that the tuition
  7 10 fee shall be equal to the actual cost of the special education
  7 11 instructional program provided to that child under the child's
  7 12 individualized education program.
  7 13    If there is no agreement between districts, or if the
  7 14 distance requirements are not met, the bill provides that the
  7 15 tuition limitations of Code section 282.1 shall not apply,
  7 16 and a student attending school in the other state shall not
  7 17 be treated as a pupil of the district of residence in Iowa
  7 18 for purposes of tuition payments to the receiving district
  7 19 or for purposes of the school aid formula.  The bill further
  7 20 establishes that an agreement reached under Code section 282.8
  7 21 does not qualify as a whole grade sharing agreement and the
  7 22 open enrollment provisions do not apply to such an agreement.
  7 23    WHOLE GRADE SHARING AGREEMENTS.  Whole grade sharing
  7 24 is a procedure used by school districts in which all or a
  7 25 substantial portion of the pupils in any grade in two or
  7 26 more school districts share an educational program for all
  7 27 or a substantial portion of a school day under a written
  7 28 agreement.  Currently, the boards of the school districts
  7 29 participating in the agreement must negotiate, as part of
  7 30 the new or existing agreement, the disposition of funding
  7 31 provided under Code chapter 284, the student achievement and
  7 32 teacher quality program.  The bill provides exemptions from
  7 33 the disposition negotiation requirement relating to beginning
  7 34 teacher mentoring and induction funds; the teacher leadership
  7 35 supplement state cost per pupil, unless all of the districts
  8  1 subject to the agreement are receiving such funding; and the
  8  2 teacher leadership supplemental aid payments, unless all
  8  3 districts subject to the agreement are receiving such funding.
  8  4 Because the funding for the teacher leadership supplemental aid
  8  5 payments is scheduled to end with the 2016=2017 fiscal year,
  8  6 the bill repeals the relevant provision June 30, 2018.
  8  7    The bill also changes, from the third Friday of February to
  8  8 the second Friday of January of each year, the second of two
  8  9 dates used to determine the number of pupils participating in a
  8 10 whole grade sharing agreement.
  8 11    OPEN ENROLLMENT PAYMENTS.  In addition to other statutory
  8 12 requirements for open enrollment payments, the bill provides
  8 13 that the board of directors of the district of residence
  8 14 must pay to the receiving district the teacher leadership
  8 15 supplement state cost per pupil for the previous fiscal year
  8 16 or the teacher leadership supplement foundation aid for the
  8 17 previous fiscal year if both the district of residence and the
  8 18 receiving district are receiving such supplements.  Such a
  8 19 limitation currently exists in Code section 284.13, subsection
  8 20 1, paragraph "e", regarding the teacher leadership supplement
  8 21 foundation aid.  Currently, the district of residence must pay
  8 22 to the receiving district the teacher leadership supplement
  8 23 state cost per pupil for the previous fiscal year whether
  8 24 or not both districts are receiving the teacher leadership
  8 25 supplement state cost per pupil.
  8 26    Currently, a district of residence must make quarterly
  8 27 payments to the receiving district.  Under the bill, the
  8 28 receiving district must bill the district of residence
  8 29 biannually, and the district of residence must make payments
  8 30 in a timely manner.
  8 31    STATEWIDE PROGRESS REPORTS.  Currently, the department of
  8 32 education must make an annual report to the general assembly
  8 33 on statewide progress in student achievement on mathematics
  8 34 and reading at the fourth and eighth grades, on the evaluator
  8 35 training program, and on changes and improvements in teacher
  9  1 evaluations.  The bill eliminates that reporting requirement.
  9  2    STUDENT ACHIEVEMENT AND TEACHER QUALITY PROGRAM.  Currently,

  9  4 state board of education, the department must consult with
  9  5 persons representing teachers, administrators, school boards,
  9  6 approved practitioner preparation institutions, and other

  6 20    ATTENDING SCHOOL OUTSIDE THE STATE.  The bill makes a number
  6 21 of changes to Code section 282.8.  The Code section authorizes
  6 22 the boards of directors of school districts located near the
  6 23 state boundaries to designate schools of equivalent standing
  6 24 across the state line for attendance of pupils, to establish
  6 25 reciprocal agreements between such districts, and to establish

  6 28    Currently, Code section 282.8 provides that tuition and
  6 29 transportation fees shall not be less than the lower average

  7  1 the equivalent tuition rate for the non=Iowa school district
  7  2 for the previous school year, and the transportation fee
  7  3 established shall not be less than the lower average cost per
  7  4 mile for yellow school buses for the previous school year of
  7  5 the two affected school districts.  The bill also provides that
  7  6 if the tuition fee for the school district in the adjoining
  7  7 state is a variable rate, the test of which tuition fee is
  7  8 lower shall be determined for each student. For students
  7  9 requiring special education, the bill provides that the tuition
  7 10 fee shall be equal to the actual cost of the special education
  7 11 instructional program provided to that child under the child's
  7 12 individualized education program.
  7 13    If there is no agreement between districts, or if the
  7 14 distance requirements are not met, the bill provides that the

  7 16 and a student attending school in the other state shall not
  7 17 be treated as a pupil of the district of residence in Iowa
  7 18 for purposes of tuition payments to the receiving district
  7 19 or for purposes of the school aid formula.  The bill further

  7 27 or a substantial portion of a school day under a written
  7 28 agreement.  Currently, the boards of the school districts
  7 29 participating in the agreement must negotiate, as part of
  7 30 the new or existing agreement, the disposition of funding
  7 31 provided under Code chapter 284, the student achievement and
  7 32 teacher quality program.  The bill provides exemptions from
  7 33 the disposition negotiation requirement relating to beginning
  7 34 teacher mentoring and induction funds; the teacher leadership
  7 35 supplement state cost per pupil, unless all of the districts
  8  1 subject to the agreement are receiving such funding; and the
  8  2 teacher leadership supplemental aid payments, unless all
  8  3 districts subject to the agreement are receiving such funding.
  8  4 Because the funding for the teacher leadership supplemental aid
  8  5 payments is scheduled to end with the 2016=2017 fiscal year,
  8  6 the bill repeals the relevant provision June 30, 2018.
  8  7    The bill also changes, from the third Friday of February to
  8  8 the second Friday of January of each year, the second of two
  8  9 dates used to determine the number of pupils participating in a
  8 10 whole grade sharing agreement.
  8 11    OPEN ENROLLMENT PAYMENTS.  In addition to other statutory
  8 12 requirements for open enrollment payments, the bill provides
  8 13 that the board of directors of the district of residence
  8 14 must pay to the receiving district the teacher leadership
  8 15 supplement state cost per pupil for the previous fiscal year
  8 16 or the teacher leadership supplement foundation aid for the
  8 17 previous fiscal year if both the district of residence and the
  8 18 receiving district are receiving such supplements.  Such a
  8 19 limitation currently exists in Code section 284.13, subsection
  8 20 1, paragraph "e", regarding the teacher leadership supplement
  8 21 foundation aid.  Currently, the district of residence must pay
  8 22 to the receiving district the teacher leadership supplement
  8 23 state cost per pupil for the previous fiscal year whether
  8 24 or not both districts are receiving the teacher leadership
  8 25 supplement state cost per pupil.
  8 26    Currently, a district of residence must make quarterly
  8 27 payments to the receiving district.  Under the bill, the
  8 28 receiving district must bill the district of residence
  8 29 biannually, and the district of residence must make payments
  8 30 in a timely manner.
  8 31    STATEWIDE PROGRESS REPORTS.  Currently, the department of
  8 32 education must make an annual report to the general assembly
  8 33 on statewide progress in student achievement on mathematics
  8 34 and reading at the fourth and eighth grades, on the evaluator
  8 35 training program, and on changes and improvements in teacher
  9  1 evaluations.  The bill eliminates that reporting requirement.
  9  2    STUDENT ACHIEVEMENT AND TEACHER QUALITY PROGRAM.  Currently,
  9  3 in developing administrative rules for consideration by the
  9  4 state board of education, the department must consult with
  9  5 persons representing teachers, administrators, school boards,
  9  6 approved practitioner preparation institutions, and other
  9  7 appropriate education stakeholders.  The bill provides that the
  9  8 department must consult stakeholders when those stakeholders
  9  9 might reasonably be affected by the proposed rule.
  9 10    TERMINOLOGY CHANGES.  Code sections 282.8 and 282.24 are
  9 11 amended to replace references to "elementary and high school"
  9 12 with the term "elementary and secondary school". Definitions
  9 13 for junior high school and high school are also stricken from
  9 14 Code section 282.24.
  9 15    REPEALS.  The bill repeals the following:
  9 16    1.  PILOT PROJECTS TO IMPROVE INSTRUCTIONAL PROGRAMS.  When
  9 17 first enacted in 1987, the provision was part of a program
  9 18 to offer incentives to school districts that established
  9 19 pilot projects to utilize a modified block schedule for
  9 20 offering classes in the districts and sharing the certificated
  9 21 instructional personnel.  Implementation by the department
  9 22 of education is dependent on whether the general assembly
  9 23 appropriates funding for the pilot projects.
  9 24    2.  TEACHER EXCHANGE PROGRAM.  The teacher exchange program
  9 25 was enacted in 1991, contingent on an appropriation of moneys
  9 26 by the general assembly, to permit school districts to exchange
  9 27 licensed instructional personnel with other districts in order
  9 28 to promote the exchange and enhancement of instructional
  9 29 methods and materials and encourage the educational development
  9 30 of Iowa's teachers.  The bill eliminates the provisions
  9 31 relating to the teacher exchange program, including provisions
  9 32 directing the state board to adopt rules to administer the
  9 33 program, directing the director of the department of education
  9 34 to administer the program, establishing the program, and
  9 35 providing for participation in the program by school districts
 10  1 and teachers.

  6 12 expression; and to submit to the general assembly an annual
  6 13 report regarding the activities, findings, and student progress
  6 14 under the core curriculum, as well as an annual report on the
  6 15 necessity of waiving statutory obligations for school districts
  6 16 in the event of a disaster.
  6 17    BUDGET GUARANTEE LANGUAGE.  The bill amends Code section
  6 18 257.14 to strike obsolete language relating to the budget
  6 19 guarantee.
  6 20    ATTENDING SCHOOL OUTSIDE THE STATE.  The bill makes a number
  6 21 of changes to Code section 282.8.  The Code section authorizes
  6 22 the boards of directors of school districts located near the
  6 23 state boundaries to designate schools of equivalent standing
  6 24 across the state line for attendance of pupils, to establish
  6 25 reciprocal agreements between such districts, and to establish
  6 26 tuition and transportation fees in an amount acceptable to the
  6 27 affected boards.
  6 28    Currently, Code section 282.8 provides that tuition and
  6 29 transportation fees shall not be less than the lower average
  6 30 cost per pupil for the previous school year of the two
  6 31 affected school districts.  The bill amends the provision to
  6 32 establish that the tuition fee for students not requiring
  6 33 special education shall not be less than the lower of the
  6 34 tuition fee established pursuant to Code section 282.24 for
  6 35 students attending school outside the district of residence or
  7  1 the equivalent tuition rate for the non=Iowa school district
  7  2 for the previous school year, and the transportation fee
  7  3 established shall not be less than the lower average cost per
  7  4 mile for yellow school buses for the previous school year of
  7  5 the two affected school districts.  The bill also provides that
  7  6 if the tuition fee for the school district in the adjoining
  7  7 state is a variable rate, the test of which tuition fee is
  7  8 lower shall be determined for each student. For students
  7  9 requiring special education, the bill provides that the tuition
  7 10 fee shall be equal to the actual cost of the special education
  7 11 instructional program provided to that child under the child's
  7 12 individualized education program.
  7 13    If there is no agreement between districts, or if the
  7 14 distance requirements are not met, the bill provides that the
  7 15 tuition limitations of Code section 282.1 shall not apply,
  7 16 and a student attending school in the other state shall not
  7 17 be treated as a pupil of the district of residence in Iowa
  7 18 for purposes of tuition payments to the receiving district
  7 19 or for purposes of the school aid formula.  The bill further
  7 20 establishes that an agreement reached under Code section 282.8
  7 21 does not qualify as a whole grade sharing agreement and the
  7 22 open enrollment provisions do not apply to such an agreement.
  7 23    WHOLE GRADE SHARING AGREEMENTS.  Whole grade sharing
  7 24 is a procedure used by school districts in which all or a
  7 25 substantial portion of the pupils in any grade in two or
  7 26 more school districts share an educational program for all
  7 27 or a substantial portion of a school day under a written
  7 28 agreement.  Currently, the boards of the school districts
  7 29 participating in the agreement must negotiate, as part of
  7 30 the new or existing agreement, the disposition of funding
  7 31 provided under Code chapter 284, the student achievement and
  7 32 teacher quality program.  The bill provides exemptions from
  7 33 the disposition negotiation requirement relating to beginning
  7 34 teacher mentoring and induction funds; the teacher leadership
  7 35 supplement state cost per pupil, unless all of the districts
  8  1 subject to the agreement are receiving such funding; and the
  8  2 teacher leadership supplemental aid payments, unless all
  8  3 districts subject to the agreement are receiving such funding.
  8  4 Because the funding for the teacher leadership supplemental aid
  8  5 payments is scheduled to end with the 2016=2017 fiscal year,
  8  6 the bill repeals the relevant provision June 30, 2018.
  8  7    The bill also changes, from the third Friday of February to
  8  8 the second Friday of January of each year, the second of two
  8  9 dates used to determine the number of pupils participating in a
  8 10 whole grade sharing agreement.
  8 11    OPEN ENROLLMENT PAYMENTS.  In addition to other statutory
  8 12 requirements for open enrollment payments, the bill provides
  8 13 that the board of directors of the district of residence
  8 14 must pay to the receiving district the teacher leadership
  8 15 supplement state cost per pupil for the previous fiscal year
  8 16 or the teacher leadership supplement foundation aid for the
  8 17 previous fiscal year if both the district of residence and the
  8 18 receiving district are receiving such supplements.  Such a
  8 19 limitation currently exists in Code section 284.13, subsection
  8 20 1, paragraph "e", regarding the teacher leadership supplement
  8 21 foundation aid.  Currently, the district of residence must pay
  8 22 to the receiving district the teacher leadership supplement
  8 23 state cost per pupil for the previous fiscal year whether
  8 24 or not both districts are receiving the teacher leadership
  8 25 supplement state cost per pupil.
  8 26    Currently, a district of residence must make quarterly
  8 27 payments to the receiving district.  Under the bill, the
  8 28 receiving district must bill the district of residence
  8 29 biannually, and the district of residence must make payments
  8 30 in a timely manner.
  8 31    STATEWIDE PROGRESS REPORTS.  Currently, the department of
  8 32 education must make an annual report to the general assembly
  8 33 on statewide progress in student achievement on mathematics
  8 34 and reading at the fourth and eighth grades, on the evaluator
  8 35 training program, and on changes and improvements in teacher
  9  1 evaluations.  The bill eliminates that reporting requirement.
  9  2    STUDENT ACHIEVEMENT AND TEACHER QUALITY PROGRAM.  Currently,
  9  3 in developing administrative rules for consideration by the
  9  4 state board of education, the department must consult with
  9  5 persons representing teachers, administrators, school boards,
  9  6 approved practitioner preparation institutions, and other
  9  7 appropriate education stakeholders.  The bill provides that the
  9  8 department must consult stakeholders when those stakeholders
  9  9 might reasonably be affected by the proposed rule.
  9 10    TERMINOLOGY CHANGES.  Code sections 282.8 and 282.24 are
  9 11 amended to replace references to "elementary and high school"
  9 12 with the term "elementary and secondary school". Definitions
  9 13 for junior high school and high school are also stricken from

  9 34 to administer the program, establishing the program, and

  6 20    ATTENDING SCHOOL OUTSIDE THE STATE.  The bill makes a number

  7 13    If there is no agreement between districts, or if the
  7 14 distance requirements are not met, the bill provides that the
  7 15 tuition limitations of Code section 282.1 shall not apply,
  7 16 and a student attending school in the other state shall not
  7 17 be treated as a pupil of the district of residence in Iowa
  7 18 for purposes of tuition payments to the receiving district
  7 19 or for purposes of the school aid formula.  The bill further
  7 20 establishes that an agreement reached under Code section 282.8
  7 21 does not qualify as a whole grade sharing agreement and the

  8  4 Because the funding for the teacher leadership supplemental aid
  8  5 payments is scheduled to end with the 2016=2017 fiscal year,
  8  6 the bill repeals the relevant provision June 30, 2018.
  8  7    The bill also changes, from the third Friday of February to

  8 11    OPEN ENROLLMENT PAYMENTS.  In addition to other statutory
  8 12 requirements for open enrollment payments, the bill provides
  8 13 that the board of directors of the district of residence
  8 14 must pay to the receiving district the teacher leadership
  8 15 supplement state cost per pupil for the previous fiscal year
  8 16 or the teacher leadership supplement foundation aid for the

  8 23 state cost per pupil for the previous fiscal year whether
  8 24 or not both districts are receiving the teacher leadership
  8 25 supplement state cost per pupil.
  8 26    Currently, a district of residence must make quarterly
  8 27 payments to the receiving district.  Under the bill, the

  8 29 biannually, and the district of residence must make payments

  6 20    ATTENDING SCHOOL OUTSIDE THE STATE.  The bill makes a number
  6 21 of changes to Code section 282.8.  The Code section authorizes
  6 22 the boards of directors of school districts located near the
  6 23 state boundaries to designate schools of equivalent standing
  6 24 across the state line for attendance of pupils, to establish
  6 25 reciprocal agreements between such districts, and to establish
  6 26 tuition and transportation fees in an amount acceptable to the
  6 27 affected boards.
  6 28    Currently, Code section 282.8 provides that tuition and
  6 29 transportation fees shall not be less than the lower average
  6 30 cost per pupil for the previous school year of the two
  6 31 affected school districts.  The bill amends the provision to
  6 32 establish that the tuition fee for students not requiring

  7  1 the equivalent tuition rate for the non=Iowa school district
  7  2 for the previous school year, and the transportation fee
  7  3 established shall not be less than the lower average cost per
  7  4 mile for yellow school buses for the previous school year of
  7  5 the two affected school districts.  The bill also provides that
  7  6 if the tuition fee for the school district in the adjoining
  7  7 state is a variable rate, the test of which tuition fee is
  7  8 lower shall be determined for each student. For students
  7  9 requiring special education, the bill provides that the tuition
  7 10 fee shall be equal to the actual cost of the special education
  7 11 instructional program provided to that child under the child's
  7 12 individualized education program.
  7 13    If there is no agreement between districts, or if the
  7 14 distance requirements are not met, the bill provides that the
  7 15 tuition limitations of Code section 282.1 shall not apply,
  7 16 and a student attending school in the other state shall not
  7 17 be treated as a pupil of the district of residence in Iowa
  7 18 for purposes of tuition payments to the receiving district
  7 19 or for purposes of the school aid formula.  The bill further
  7 20 establishes that an agreement reached under Code section 282.8
  7 21 does not qualify as a whole grade sharing agreement and the
  7 22 open enrollment provisions do not apply to such an agreement.
  7 23    WHOLE GRADE SHARING AGREEMENTS.  Whole grade sharing
  7 24 is a procedure used by school districts in which all or a
  7 25 substantial portion of the pupils in any grade in two or
  7 26 more school districts share an educational program for all
  7 27 or a substantial portion of a school day under a written
  7 28 agreement.  Currently, the boards of the school districts
  7 29 participating in the agreement must negotiate, as part of
  7 30 the new or existing agreement, the disposition of funding
  7 31 provided under Code chapter 284, the student achievement and
  7 32 teacher quality program.  The bill provides exemptions from
  7 33 the disposition negotiation requirement relating to beginning
  7 34 teacher mentoring and induction funds; the teacher leadership
  7 35 supplement state cost per pupil, unless all of the districts
  8  1 subject to the agreement are receiving such funding; and the
  8  2 teacher leadership supplemental aid payments, unless all
  8  3 districts subject to the agreement are receiving such funding.
  8  4 Because the funding for the teacher leadership supplemental aid
  8  5 payments is scheduled to end with the 2016=2017 fiscal year,
  8  6 the bill repeals the relevant provision June 30, 2018.
  8  7    The bill also changes, from the third Friday of February to
  8  8 the second Friday of January of each year, the second of two
  8  9 dates used to determine the number of pupils participating in a
  8 10 whole grade sharing agreement.
  8 11    OPEN ENROLLMENT PAYMENTS.  In addition to other statutory
  8 12 requirements for open enrollment payments, the bill provides
  8 13 that the board of directors of the district of residence
  8 14 must pay to the receiving district the teacher leadership
  8 15 supplement state cost per pupil for the previous fiscal year
  8 16 or the teacher leadership supplement foundation aid for the
  8 17 previous fiscal year if both the district of residence and the
  8 18 receiving district are receiving such supplements.  Such a
  8 19 limitation currently exists in Code section 284.13, subsection
  8 20 1, paragraph "e", regarding the teacher leadership supplement
  8 21 foundation aid.  Currently, the district of residence must pay
  8 22 to the receiving district the teacher leadership supplement
  8 23 state cost per pupil for the previous fiscal year whether
  8 24 or not both districts are receiving the teacher leadership
  8 25 supplement state cost per pupil.
  8 26    Currently, a district of residence must make quarterly
  8 27 payments to the receiving district.  Under the bill, the
  8 28 receiving district must bill the district of residence
  8 29 biannually, and the district of residence must make payments
  8 30 in a timely manner.
  8 31    STATEWIDE PROGRESS REPORTS.  Currently, the department of

  8 33 on statewide progress in student achievement on mathematics
  8 34 and reading at the fourth and eighth grades, on the evaluator
  8 35 training program, and on changes and improvements in teacher
  9  1 evaluations.  The bill eliminates that reporting requirement.
  9  2    STUDENT ACHIEVEMENT AND TEACHER QUALITY PROGRAM.  Currently,
  9  3 in developing administrative rules for consideration by the
  9  4 state board of education, the department must consult with
  9  5 persons representing teachers, administrators, school boards,
  9  6 approved practitioner preparation institutions, and other
  9  7 appropriate education stakeholders.  The bill provides that the
  9  8 department must consult stakeholders when those stakeholders
  9  9 might reasonably be affected by the proposed rule.
  9 10    TERMINOLOGY CHANGES.  Code sections 282.8 and 282.24 are
  9 11 amended to replace references to "elementary and high school"
  9 12 with the term "elementary and secondary school". Definitions
  9 13 for junior high school and high school are also stricken from
  9 14 Code section 282.24.
  9 15    REPEALS.  The bill repeals the following:
  9 16    1.  PILOT PROJECTS TO IMPROVE INSTRUCTIONAL PROGRAMS.  When
  9 17 first enacted in 1987, the provision was part of a program
  9 18 to offer incentives to school districts that established
  9 19 pilot projects to utilize a modified block schedule for
  9 20 offering classes in the districts and sharing the certificated
  9 21 instructional personnel.  Implementation by the department
  9 22 of education is dependent on whether the general assembly
  9 23 appropriates funding for the pilot projects.
  9 24    2.  TEACHER EXCHANGE PROGRAM.  The teacher exchange program
  9 25 was enacted in 1991, contingent on an appropriation of moneys
  9 26 by the general assembly, to permit school districts to exchange
  9 27 licensed instructional personnel with other districts in order
  9 28 to promote the exchange and enhancement of instructional
  9 29 methods and materials and encourage the educational development
  9 30 of Iowa's teachers.  The bill eliminates the provisions
  9 31 relating to the teacher exchange program, including provisions
  9 32 directing the state board to adopt rules to administer the
  9 33 program, directing the director of the department of education
  9 34 to administer the program, establishing the program, and
  9 35 providing for participation in the program by school districts
 10  1 and teachers.

  6 18 257.14 to strike obsolete language relating to the budget
  6 19 guarantee.
  6 20    ATTENDING SCHOOL OUTSIDE THE STATE.  The bill makes a number
  6 21 of changes to Code section 282.8.  The Code section authorizes
  6 22 the boards of directors of school districts located near the
  6 23 state boundaries to designate schools of equivalent standing
  6 24 across the state line for attendance of pupils, to establish
  6 25 reciprocal agreements between such districts, and to establish
  6 26 tuition and transportation fees in an amount acceptable to the
  6 27 affected boards.
  6 28    Currently, Code section 282.8 provides that tuition and
  6 29 transportation fees shall not be less than the lower average
  6 30 cost per pupil for the previous school year of the two
  6 31 affected school districts.  The bill amends the provision to
  6 32 establish that the tuition fee for students not requiring
  6 33 special education shall not be less than the lower of the
  6 34 tuition fee established pursuant to Code section 282.24 for
  6 35 students attending school outside the district of residence or
  7  1 the equivalent tuition rate for the non=Iowa school district
  7  2 for the previous school year, and the transportation fee
  7  3 established shall not be less than the lower average cost per
  7  4 mile for yellow school buses for the previous school year of
  7  5 the two affected school districts.  The bill also provides that
  7  6 if the tuition fee for the school district in the adjoining
  7  7 state is a variable rate, the test of which tuition fee is
  7  8 lower shall be determined for each student. For students
  7  9 requiring special education, the bill provides that the tuition
  7 10 fee shall be equal to the actual cost of the special education
  7 11 instructional program provided to that child under the child's
  7 12 individualized education program.
  7 13    If there is no agreement between districts, or if the
  7 14 distance requirements are not met, the bill provides that the
  7 15 tuition limitations of Code section 282.1 shall not apply,
  7 16 and a student attending school in the other state shall not
  7 17 be treated as a pupil of the district of residence in Iowa
  7 18 for purposes of tuition payments to the receiving district
  7 19 or for purposes of the school aid formula.  The bill further
  7 20 establishes that an agreement reached under Code section 282.8
  7 21 does not qualify as a whole grade sharing agreement and the
  7 22 open enrollment provisions do not apply to such an agreement.
  7 23    WHOLE GRADE SHARING AGREEMENTS.  Whole grade sharing
  7 24 is a procedure used by school districts in which all or a
  7 25 substantial portion of the pupils in any grade in two or
  7 26 more school districts share an educational program for all
  7 27 or a substantial portion of a school day under a written
  7 28 agreement.  Currently, the boards of the school districts
  7 29 participating in the agreement must negotiate, as part of
  7 30 the new or existing agreement, the disposition of funding
  7 31 provided under Code chapter 284, the student achievement and
  7 32 teacher quality program.  The bill provides exemptions from
  7 33 the disposition negotiation requirement relating to beginning
  7 34 teacher mentoring and induction funds; the teacher leadership
  7 35 supplement state cost per pupil, unless all of the districts
  8  1 subject to the agreement are receiving such funding; and the
  8  2 teacher leadership supplemental aid payments, unless all
  8  3 districts subject to the agreement are receiving such funding.
  8  4 Because the funding for the teacher leadership supplemental aid
  8  5 payments is scheduled to end with the 2016=2017 fiscal year,
  8  6 the bill repeals the relevant provision June 30, 2018.
  8  7    The bill also changes, from the third Friday of February to
  8  8 the second Friday of January of each year, the second of two
  8  9 dates used to determine the number of pupils participating in a
  8 10 whole grade sharing agreement.
  8 11    OPEN ENROLLMENT PAYMENTS.  In addition to other statutory
  8 12 requirements for open enrollment payments, the bill provides
  8 13 that the board of directors of the district of residence
  8 14 must pay to the receiving district the teacher leadership
  8 15 supplement state cost per pupil for the previous fiscal year
  8 16 or the teacher leadership supplement foundation aid for the
  8 17 previous fiscal year if both the district of residence and the
  8 18 receiving district are receiving such supplements.  Such a
  8 19 limitation currently exists in Code section 284.13, subsection
  8 20 1, paragraph "e", regarding the teacher leadership supplement
  8 21 foundation aid.  Currently, the district of residence must pay
  8 22 to the receiving district the teacher leadership supplement
  8 23 state cost per pupil for the previous fiscal year whether
  8 24 or not both districts are receiving the teacher leadership
  8 25 supplement state cost per pupil.
  8 26    Currently, a district of residence must make quarterly
  8 27 payments to the receiving district.  Under the bill, the
  8 28 receiving district must bill the district of residence
  8 29 biannually, and the district of residence must make payments
  8 30 in a timely manner.
  8 31    STATEWIDE PROGRESS REPORTS.  Currently, the department of
  8 32 education must make an annual report to the general assembly
  8 33 on statewide progress in student achievement on mathematics
  8 34 and reading at the fourth and eighth grades, on the evaluator
  8 35 training program, and on changes and improvements in teacher
  9  1 evaluations.  The bill eliminates that reporting requirement.
  9  2    STUDENT ACHIEVEMENT AND TEACHER QUALITY PROGRAM.  Currently,
  9  3 in developing administrative rules for consideration by the
  9  4 state board of education, the department must consult with
  9  5 persons representing teachers, administrators, school boards,
  9  6 approved practitioner preparation institutions, and other
  9  7 appropriate education stakeholders.  The bill provides that the
  9  8 department must consult stakeholders when those stakeholders
  9  9 might reasonably be affected by the proposed rule.
  9 10    TERMINOLOGY CHANGES.  Code sections 282.8 and 282.24 are
  9 11 amended to replace references to "elementary and high school"
  9 12 with the term "elementary and secondary school". Definitions
  9 13 for junior high school and high school are also stricken from
  9 14 Code section 282.24.

  9 34 to administer the program, establishing the program, and

  6 20    ATTENDING SCHOOL OUTSIDE THE STATE.  The bill makes a number
  6 21 of changes to Code section 282.8.  The Code section authorizes
  6 22 the boards of directors of school districts located near the
  6 23 state boundaries to designate schools of equivalent standing
  6 24 across the state line for attendance of pupils, to establish
  6 25 reciprocal agreements between such districts, and to establish

  6 28    Currently, Code section 282.8 provides that tuition and
  6 29 transportation fees shall not be less than the lower average
  6 30 cost per pupil for the previous school year of the two
  6 31 affected school districts.  The bill amends the provision to
  6 32 establish that the tuition fee for students not requiring
  6 33 special education shall not be less than the lower of the

  7  2 for the previous school year, and the transportation fee
  7  3 established shall not be less than the lower average cost per
  7  4 mile for yellow school buses for the previous school year of
  7  5 the two affected school districts.  The bill also provides that
  7  6 if the tuition fee for the school district in the adjoining
  7  7 state is a variable rate, the test of which tuition fee is
  7  8 lower shall be determined for each student. For students
  7  9 requiring special education, the bill provides that the tuition
  7 10 fee shall be equal to the actual cost of the special education
  7 11 instructional program provided to that child under the child's
  7 12 individualized education program.
  7 13    If there is no agreement between districts, or if the
  7 14 distance requirements are not met, the bill provides that the
  7 15 tuition limitations of Code section 282.1 shall not apply,
  7 16 and a student attending school in the other state shall not
  7 17 be treated as a pupil of the district of residence in Iowa
  7 18 for purposes of tuition payments to the receiving district
  7 19 or for purposes of the school aid formula.  The bill further
  7 20 establishes that an agreement reached under Code section 282.8
  7 21 does not qualify as a whole grade sharing agreement and the
  7 22 open enrollment provisions do not apply to such an agreement.
  7 23    WHOLE GRADE SHARING AGREEMENTS.  Whole grade sharing
  7 24 is a procedure used by school districts in which all or a
  7 25 substantial portion of the pupils in any grade in two or
  7 26 more school districts share an educational program for all
  7 27 or a substantial portion of a school day under a written
  7 28 agreement.  Currently, the boards of the school districts
  7 29 participating in the agreement must negotiate, as part of
  7 30 the new or existing agreement, the disposition of funding
  7 31 provided under Code chapter 284, the student achievement and
  7 32 teacher quality program.  The bill provides exemptions from
  7 33 the disposition negotiation requirement relating to beginning
  7 34 teacher mentoring and induction funds; the teacher leadership
  7 35 supplement state cost per pupil, unless all of the districts
  8  1 subject to the agreement are receiving such funding; and the
  8  2 teacher leadership supplemental aid payments, unless all
  8  3 districts subject to the agreement are receiving such funding.
  8  4 Because the funding for the teacher leadership supplemental aid
  8  5 payments is scheduled to end with the 2016=2017 fiscal year,
  8  6 the bill repeals the relevant provision June 30, 2018.
  8  7    The bill also changes, from the third Friday of February to
  8  8 the second Friday of January of each year, the second of two
  8  9 dates used to determine the number of pupils participating in a
  8 10 whole grade sharing agreement.
  8 11    OPEN ENROLLMENT PAYMENTS.  In addition to other statutory
  8 12 requirements for open enrollment payments, the bill provides
  8 13 that the board of directors of the district of residence
  8 14 must pay to the receiving district the teacher leadership
  8 15 supplement state cost per pupil for the previous fiscal year
  8 16 or the teacher leadership supplement foundation aid for the
  8 17 previous fiscal year if both the district of residence and the
  8 18 receiving district are receiving such supplements.  Such a
  8 19 limitation currently exists in Code section 284.13, subsection
  8 20 1, paragraph "e", regarding the teacher leadership supplement
  8 21 foundation aid.  Currently, the district of residence must pay
  8 22 to the receiving district the teacher leadership supplement
  8 23 state cost per pupil for the previous fiscal year whether
  8 24 or not both districts are receiving the teacher leadership
  8 25 supplement state cost per pupil.
  8 26    Currently, a district of residence must make quarterly
  8 27 payments to the receiving district.  Under the bill, the
  8 28 receiving district must bill the district of residence
  8 29 biannually, and the district of residence must make payments
  8 30 in a timely manner.

  6 21 of changes to Code section 282.8.  The Code section authorizes
  6 22 the boards of directors of school districts located near the

  6 28    Currently, Code section 282.8 provides that tuition and
  6 29 transportation fees shall not be less than the lower average

  7  9 requiring special education, the bill provides that the tuition
  7 10 fee shall be equal to the actual cost of the special education
  7 11 instructional program provided to that child under the child's
  7 12 individualized education program.
  7 13    If there is no agreement between districts, or if the
  7 14 distance requirements are not met, the bill provides that the
  7 15 tuition limitations of Code section 282.1 shall not apply,
  7 16 and a student attending school in the other state shall not
  7 17 be treated as a pupil of the district of residence in Iowa
  7 18 for purposes of tuition payments to the receiving district
  7 19 or for purposes of the school aid formula.  The bill further
  7 20 establishes that an agreement reached under Code section 282.8
  7 21 does not qualify as a whole grade sharing agreement and the
  7 22 open enrollment provisions do not apply to such an agreement.
  7 23    WHOLE GRADE SHARING AGREEMENTS.  Whole grade sharing
  7 24 is a procedure used by school districts in which all or a
  7 25 substantial portion of the pupils in any grade in two or
  7 26 more school districts share an educational program for all
  7 27 or a substantial portion of a school day under a written

  7 29 participating in the agreement must negotiate, as part of
  7 30 the new or existing agreement, the disposition of funding
  7 31 provided under Code chapter 284, the student achievement and

  7 35 supplement state cost per pupil, unless all of the districts
  8  1 subject to the agreement are receiving such funding; and the
  8  2 teacher leadership supplemental aid payments, unless all
  8  3 districts subject to the agreement are receiving such funding.
  8  4 Because the funding for the teacher leadership supplemental aid
  8  5 payments is scheduled to end with the 2016=2017 fiscal year,
  8  6 the bill repeals the relevant provision June 30, 2018.

  8 12 requirements for open enrollment payments, the bill provides
  8 13 that the board of directors of the district of residence
  8 14 must pay to the receiving district the teacher leadership
  8 15 supplement state cost per pupil for the previous fiscal year
  8 16 or the teacher leadership supplement foundation aid for the
  8 17 previous fiscal year if both the district of residence and the

  8 23 state cost per pupil for the previous fiscal year whether
  8 24 or not both districts are receiving the teacher leadership
  8 25 supplement state cost per pupil.
  8 26    Currently, a district of residence must make quarterly
  8 27 payments to the receiving district.  Under the bill, the

  6 29 transportation fees shall not be less than the lower average
  6 30 cost per pupil for the previous school year of the two
  6 31 affected school districts.  The bill amends the provision to
  6 32 establish that the tuition fee for students not requiring
  6 33 special education shall not be less than the lower of the
  6 34 tuition fee established pursuant to Code section 282.24 for
  6 35 students attending school outside the district of residence or
  7  1 the equivalent tuition rate for the non=Iowa school district
  7  2 for the previous school year, and the transportation fee
  7  3 established shall not be less than the lower average cost per
  7  4 mile for yellow school buses for the previous school year of
  7  5 the two affected school districts.  The bill also provides that
  7  6 if the tuition fee for the school district in the adjoining
  7  7 state is a variable rate, the test of which tuition fee is
  7  8 lower shall be determined for each student. For students
  7  9 requiring special education, the bill provides that the tuition
  7 10 fee shall be equal to the actual cost of the special education
  7 11 instructional program provided to that child under the child's
  7 12 individualized education program.
  7 13    If there is no agreement between districts, or if the
  7 14 distance requirements are not met, the bill provides that the
  7 15 tuition limitations of Code section 282.1 shall not apply,
  7 16 and a student attending school in the other state shall not
  7 17 be treated as a pupil of the district of residence in Iowa
  7 18 for purposes of tuition payments to the receiving district
  7 19 or for purposes of the school aid formula.  The bill further
  7 20 establishes that an agreement reached under Code section 282.8
  7 21 does not qualify as a whole grade sharing agreement and the
  7 22 open enrollment provisions do not apply to such an agreement.
  7 23    WHOLE GRADE SHARING AGREEMENTS.  Whole grade sharing
  7 24 is a procedure used by school districts in which all or a
  7 25 substantial portion of the pupils in any grade in two or
  7 26 more school districts share an educational program for all
  7 27 or a substantial portion of a school day under a written
  7 28 agreement.  Currently, the boards of the school districts
  7 29 participating in the agreement must negotiate, as part of
  7 30 the new or existing agreement, the disposition of funding
  7 31 provided under Code chapter 284, the student achievement and
  7 32 teacher quality program.  The bill provides exemptions from
  7 33 the disposition negotiation requirement relating to beginning
  7 34 teacher mentoring and induction funds; the teacher leadership
  7 35 supplement state cost per pupil, unless all of the districts
  8  1 subject to the agreement are receiving such funding; and the
  8  2 teacher leadership supplemental aid payments, unless all
  8  3 districts subject to the agreement are receiving such funding.
  8  4 Because the funding for the teacher leadership supplemental aid
  8  5 payments is scheduled to end with the 2016=2017 fiscal year,
  8  6 the bill repeals the relevant provision June 30, 2018.
  8  7    The bill also changes, from the third Friday of February to
  8  8 the second Friday of January of each year, the second of two
  8  9 dates used to determine the number of pupils participating in a
  8 10 whole grade sharing agreement.
  8 11    OPEN ENROLLMENT PAYMENTS.  In addition to other statutory
  8 12 requirements for open enrollment payments, the bill provides
  8 13 that the board of directors of the district of residence
  8 14 must pay to the receiving district the teacher leadership
  8 15 supplement state cost per pupil for the previous fiscal year
  8 16 or the teacher leadership supplement foundation aid for the
  8 17 previous fiscal year if both the district of residence and the
  8 18 receiving district are receiving such supplements.  Such a
  8 19 limitation currently exists in Code section 284.13, subsection
  8 20 1, paragraph "e", regarding the teacher leadership supplement
  8 21 foundation aid.  Currently, the district of residence must pay
  8 22 to the receiving district the teacher leadership supplement
  8 23 state cost per pupil for the previous fiscal year whether
  8 24 or not both districts are receiving the teacher leadership
  8 25 supplement state cost per pupil.
  8 26    Currently, a district of residence must make quarterly
  8 27 payments to the receiving district.  Under the bill, the
  8 28 receiving district must bill the district of residence
  8 29 biannually, and the district of residence must make payments
  8 30 in a timely manner.
  8 31    STATEWIDE PROGRESS REPORTS.  Currently, the department of
  8 32 education must make an annual report to the general assembly
  8 33 on statewide progress in student achievement on mathematics
  8 34 and reading at the fourth and eighth grades, on the evaluator
  8 35 training program, and on changes and improvements in teacher
  9  1 evaluations.  The bill eliminates that reporting requirement.
  9  2    STUDENT ACHIEVEMENT AND TEACHER QUALITY PROGRAM.  Currently,
  9  3 in developing administrative rules for consideration by the
  9  4 state board of education, the department must consult with
  9  5 persons representing teachers, administrators, school boards,
  9  6 approved practitioner preparation institutions, and other
  9  7 appropriate education stakeholders.  The bill provides that the
  9  8 department must consult stakeholders when those stakeholders
  9  9 might reasonably be affected by the proposed rule.
  9 10    TERMINOLOGY CHANGES.  Code sections 282.8 and 282.24 are
  9 11 amended to replace references to "elementary and high school"
  9 12 with the term "elementary and secondary school". Definitions
  9 13 for junior high school and high school are also stricken from
  9 14 Code section 282.24.
  9 15    REPEALS.  The bill repeals the following:
  9 16    1.  PILOT PROJECTS TO IMPROVE INSTRUCTIONAL PROGRAMS.  When
  9 17 first enacted in 1987, the provision was part of a program
  9 18 to offer incentives to school districts that established
  9 19 pilot projects to utilize a modified block schedule for
  9 20 offering classes in the districts and sharing the certificated
  9 21 instructional personnel.  Implementation by the department
  9 22 of education is dependent on whether the general assembly
  9 23 appropriates funding for the pilot projects.
  9 24    2.  TEACHER EXCHANGE PROGRAM.  The teacher exchange program
  9 25 was enacted in 1991, contingent on an appropriation of moneys
  9 26 by the general assembly, to permit school districts to exchange
  9 27 licensed instructional personnel with other districts in order
  9 28 to promote the exchange and enhancement of instructional
  9 29 methods and materials and encourage the educational development
  9 30 of Iowa's teachers.  The bill eliminates the provisions
  9 31 relating to the teacher exchange program, including provisions
  9 32 directing the state board to adopt rules to administer the
  9 33 program, directing the director of the department of education
  9 34 to administer the program, establishing the program, and
  9 35 providing for participation in the program by school districts
 10  1 and teachers.

  6 20    ATTENDING SCHOOL OUTSIDE THE STATE.  The bill makes a number
  6 21 of changes to Code section 282.8.  The Code section authorizes
  6 22 the boards of directors of school districts located near the
  6 23 state boundaries to designate schools of equivalent standing
  6 24 across the state line for attendance of pupils, to establish
  6 25 reciprocal agreements between such districts, and to establish
  6 26 tuition and transportation fees in an amount acceptable to the
  6 27 affected boards.
  6 28    Currently, Code section 282.8 provides that tuition and
  6 29 transportation fees shall not be less than the lower average
  6 30 cost per pupil for the previous school year of the two
  6 31 affected school districts.  The bill amends the provision to
  6 32 establish that the tuition fee for students not requiring
  6 33 special education shall not be less than the lower of the
  6 34 tuition fee established pursuant to Code section 282.24 for
  6 35 students attending school outside the district of residence or
  7  1 the equivalent tuition rate for the non=Iowa school district
  7  2 for the previous school year, and the transportation fee
  7  3 established shall not be less than the lower average cost per
  7  4 mile for yellow school buses for the previous school year of
  7  5 the two affected school districts.  The bill also provides that
  7  6 if the tuition fee for the school district in the adjoining
  7  7 state is a variable rate, the test of which tuition fee is
  7  8 lower shall be determined for each student. For students
  7  9 requiring special education, the bill provides that the tuition
  7 10 fee shall be equal to the actual cost of the special education
  7 11 instructional program provided to that child under the child's
  7 12 individualized education program.
  7 13    If there is no agreement between districts, or if the
  7 14 distance requirements are not met, the bill provides that the
  7 15 tuition limitations of Code section 282.1 shall not apply,
  7 16 and a student attending school in the other state shall not
  7 17 be treated as a pupil of the district of residence in Iowa
  7 18 for purposes of tuition payments to the receiving district
  7 19 or for purposes of the school aid formula.  The bill further
  7 20 establishes that an agreement reached under Code section 282.8
  7 21 does not qualify as a whole grade sharing agreement and the
  7 22 open enrollment provisions do not apply to such an agreement.
  7 23    WHOLE GRADE SHARING AGREEMENTS.  Whole grade sharing
  7 24 is a procedure used by school districts in which all or a
  7 25 substantial portion of the pupils in any grade in two or
  7 26 more school districts share an educational program for all
  7 27 or a substantial portion of a school day under a written
  7 28 agreement.  Currently, the boards of the school districts
  7 29 participating in the agreement must negotiate, as part of
  7 30 the new or existing agreement, the disposition of funding
  7 31 provided under Code chapter 284, the student achievement and
  7 32 teacher quality program.  The bill provides exemptions from
  7 33 the disposition negotiation requirement relating to beginning
  7 34 teacher mentoring and induction funds; the teacher leadership
  7 35 supplement state cost per pupil, unless all of the districts
  8  1 subject to the agreement are receiving such funding; and the
  8  2 teacher leadership supplemental aid payments, unless all
  8  3 districts subject to the agreement are receiving such funding.
  8  4 Because the funding for the teacher leadership supplemental aid
  8  5 payments is scheduled to end with the 2016=2017 fiscal year,
  8  6 the bill repeals the relevant provision June 30, 2018.
  8  7    The bill also changes, from the third Friday of February to
  8  8 the second Friday of January of each year, the second of two
  8  9 dates used to determine the number of pupils participating in a
  8 10 whole grade sharing agreement.
  8 11    OPEN ENROLLMENT PAYMENTS.  In addition to other statutory
  8 12 requirements for open enrollment payments, the bill provides
  8 13 that the board of directors of the district of residence
  8 14 must pay to the receiving district the teacher leadership
  8 15 supplement state cost per pupil for the previous fiscal year
  8 16 or the teacher leadership supplement foundation aid for the
  8 17 previous fiscal year if both the district of residence and the
  8 18 receiving district are receiving such supplements.  Such a
  8 19 limitation currently exists in Code section 284.13, subsection
  8 20 1, paragraph "e", regarding the teacher leadership supplement
  8 21 foundation aid.  Currently, the district of residence must pay
  8 22 to the receiving district the teacher leadership supplement
  8 23 state cost per pupil for the previous fiscal year whether
  8 24 or not both districts are receiving the teacher leadership
  8 25 supplement state cost per pupil.
  8 26    Currently, a district of residence must make quarterly
  8 27 payments to the receiving district.  Under the bill, the
  8 28 receiving district must bill the district of residence
  8 29 biannually, and the district of residence must make payments
  8 30 in a timely manner.
  8 31    STATEWIDE PROGRESS REPORTS.  Currently, the department of
  8 32 education must make an annual report to the general assembly
  8 33 on statewide progress in student achievement on mathematics
  8 34 and reading at the fourth and eighth grades, on the evaluator
  8 35 training program, and on changes and improvements in teacher
  9  1 evaluations.  The bill eliminates that reporting requirement.
  9  2    STUDENT ACHIEVEMENT AND TEACHER QUALITY PROGRAM.  Currently,
  9  3 in developing administrative rules for consideration by the
  9  4 state board of education, the department must consult with
  9  5 persons representing teachers, administrators, school boards,
  9  6 approved practitioner preparation institutions, and other
  9  7 appropriate education stakeholders.  The bill provides that the
  9  8 department must consult stakeholders when those stakeholders
  9  9 might reasonably be affected by the proposed rule.
  9 10    TERMINOLOGY CHANGES.  Code sections 282.8 and 282.24 are
  9 11 amended to replace references to "elementary and high school"
  9 12 with the term "elementary and secondary school". Definitions
  9 13 for junior high school and high school are also stricken from
  9 14 Code section 282.24.

  9 34 to administer the program, establishing the program, and
  9 35 providing for participation in the program by school districts
 10  1 and teachers.

  6 20    ATTENDING SCHOOL OUTSIDE THE STATE.  The bill makes a number
  6 21 of changes to Code section 282.8.  The Code section authorizes
  6 22 the boards of directors of school districts located near the

  6 28    Currently, Code section 282.8 provides that tuition and
  6 29 transportation fees shall not be less than the lower average
  6 30 cost per pupil for the previous school year of the two
  6 31 affected school districts.  The bill amends the provision to
  6 32 establish that the tuition fee for students not requiring

  7  3 established shall not be less than the lower average cost per

  7 10 fee shall be equal to the actual cost of the special education
  7 11 instructional program provided to that child under the child's
  7 12 individualized education program.
  7 13    If there is no agreement between districts, or if the
  7 14 distance requirements are not met, the bill provides that the
  7 15 tuition limitations of Code section 282.1 shall not apply,
  7 16 and a student attending school in the other state shall not
  7 17 be treated as a pupil of the district of residence in Iowa
  7 18 for purposes of tuition payments to the receiving district
  7 19 or for purposes of the school aid formula.  The bill further
  7 20 establishes that an agreement reached under Code section 282.8
  7 21 does not qualify as a whole grade sharing agreement and the
  7 22 open enrollment provisions do not apply to such an agreement.
  7 23    WHOLE GRADE SHARING AGREEMENTS.  Whole grade sharing
  7 24 is a procedure used by school districts in which all or a
  7 25 substantial portion of the pupils in any grade in two or
  7 26 more school districts share an educational program for all
  7 27 or a substantial portion of a school day under a written

  7 29 participating in the agreement must negotiate, as part of
  7 30 the new or existing agreement, the disposition of funding
  7 31 provided under Code chapter 284, the student achievement and
  7 32 teacher quality program.  The bill provides exemptions from
  7 33 the disposition negotiation requirement relating to beginning
  7 34 teacher mentoring and induction funds; the teacher leadership
  7 35 supplement state cost per pupil, unless all of the districts
  8  1 subject to the agreement are receiving such funding; and the
  8  2 teacher leadership supplemental aid payments, unless all
  8  3 districts subject to the agreement are receiving such funding.
  8  4 Because the funding for the teacher leadership supplemental aid
  8  5 payments is scheduled to end with the 2016=2017 fiscal year,
  8  6 the bill repeals the relevant provision June 30, 2018.
  8  7    The bill also changes, from the third Friday of February to

  8 11    OPEN ENROLLMENT PAYMENTS.  In addition to other statutory
  8 12 requirements for open enrollment payments, the bill provides
  8 13 that the board of directors of the district of residence
  8 14 must pay to the receiving district the teacher leadership
  8 15 supplement state cost per pupil for the previous fiscal year
  8 16 or the teacher leadership supplement foundation aid for the
  8 17 previous fiscal year if both the district of residence and the

  8 21 foundation aid.  Currently, the district of residence must pay
  8 22 to the receiving district the teacher leadership supplement
  8 23 state cost per pupil for the previous fiscal year whether
  8 24 or not both districts are receiving the teacher leadership
  8 25 supplement state cost per pupil.
  8 26    Currently, a district of residence must make quarterly
  8 27 payments to the receiving district.  Under the bill, the
  8 28 receiving district must bill the district of residence
  8 29 biannually, and the district of residence must make payments

  7 15 tuition limitations of Code section 282.1 shall not apply,
  7 16 and a student attending school in the other state shall not
  7 17 be treated as a pupil of the district of residence in Iowa
  7 18 for purposes of tuition payments to the receiving district
  7 19 or for purposes of the school aid formula.  The bill further
  7 20 establishes that an agreement reached under Code section 282.8
  7 21 does not qualify as a whole grade sharing agreement and the
  7 22 open enrollment provisions do not apply to such an agreement.
  7 23    WHOLE GRADE SHARING AGREEMENTS.  Whole grade sharing
  7 24 is a procedure used by school districts in which all or a
  7 25 substantial portion of the pupils in any grade in two or
  7 26 more school districts share an educational program for all
  7 27 or a substantial portion of a school day under a written

  7 29 participating in the agreement must negotiate, as part of
  7 30 the new or existing agreement, the disposition of funding
  7 31 provided under Code chapter 284, the student achievement and

  8  1 subject to the agreement are receiving such funding; and the
  8  2 teacher leadership supplemental aid payments, unless all
  8  3 districts subject to the agreement are receiving such funding.
  8  4 Because the funding for the teacher leadership supplemental aid
  8  5 payments is scheduled to end with the 2016=2017 fiscal year,
  8  6 the bill repeals the relevant provision June 30, 2018.
  8  7    The bill also changes, from the third Friday of February to
  8  8 the second Friday of January of each year, the second of two
  8  9 dates used to determine the number of pupils participating in a
  8 10 whole grade sharing agreement.
  8 11    OPEN ENROLLMENT PAYMENTS.  In addition to other statutory
  8 12 requirements for open enrollment payments, the bill provides
  8 13 that the board of directors of the district of residence
  8 14 must pay to the receiving district the teacher leadership
  8 15 supplement state cost per pupil for the previous fiscal year
  8 16 or the teacher leadership supplement foundation aid for the
  8 17 previous fiscal year if both the district of residence and the

  8 20 1, paragraph "e", regarding the teacher leadership supplement
  8 21 foundation aid.  Currently, the district of residence must pay
  8 22 to the receiving district the teacher leadership supplement
  8 23 state cost per pupil for the previous fiscal year whether
  8 24 or not both districts are receiving the teacher leadership
  8 25 supplement state cost per pupil.
  8 26    Currently, a district of residence must make quarterly
  8 27 payments to the receiving district.  Under the bill, the
  8 28 receiving district must bill the district of residence
  8 29 biannually, and the district of residence must make payments
  8 30 in a timely manner.
  8 31    STATEWIDE PROGRESS REPORTS.  Currently, the department of
  8 32 education must make an annual report to the general assembly
  8 33 on statewide progress in student achievement on mathematics
  8 34 and reading at the fourth and eighth grades, on the evaluator
  8 35 training program, and on changes and improvements in teacher
  9  1 evaluations.  The bill eliminates that reporting requirement.
  9  2    STUDENT ACHIEVEMENT AND TEACHER QUALITY PROGRAM.  Currently,
  9  3 in developing administrative rules for consideration by the
  9  4 state board of education, the department must consult with
  9  5 persons representing teachers, administrators, school boards,
  9  6 approved practitioner preparation institutions, and other
  9  7 appropriate education stakeholders.  The bill provides that the
  9  8 department must consult stakeholders when those stakeholders
  9  9 might reasonably be affected by the proposed rule.
  9 10    TERMINOLOGY CHANGES.  Code sections 282.8 and 282.24 are
  9 11 amended to replace references to "elementary and high school"
  9 12 with the term "elementary and secondary school". Definitions
  9 13 for junior high school and high school are also stricken from
  9 14 Code section 282.24.
  9 15    REPEALS.  The bill repeals the following:
  9 16    1.  PILOT PROJECTS TO IMPROVE INSTRUCTIONAL PROGRAMS.  When
  9 17 first enacted in 1987, the provision was part of a program
  9 18 to offer incentives to school districts that established
  9 19 pilot projects to utilize a modified block schedule for
  9 20 offering classes in the districts and sharing the certificated
  9 21 instructional personnel.  Implementation by the department
  9 22 of education is dependent on whether the general assembly
  9 23 appropriates funding for the pilot projects.
  9 24    2.  TEACHER EXCHANGE PROGRAM.  The teacher exchange program
  9 25 was enacted in 1991, contingent on an appropriation of moneys
  9 26 by the general assembly, to permit school districts to exchange
  9 27 licensed instructional personnel with other districts in order
  9 28 to promote the exchange and enhancement of instructional
  9 29 methods and materials and encourage the educational development
  9 30 of Iowa's teachers.  The bill eliminates the provisions
  9 31 relating to the teacher exchange program, including provisions
  9 32 directing the state board to adopt rules to administer the
  9 33 program, directing the director of the department of education
  9 34 to administer the program, establishing the program, and
  9 35 providing for participation in the program by school districts
 10  1 and teachers.

  6 22 the boards of directors of school districts located near the
  6 23 state boundaries to designate schools of equivalent standing
  6 24 across the state line for attendance of pupils, to establish
  6 25 reciprocal agreements between such districts, and to establish
  6 26 tuition and transportation fees in an amount acceptable to the
  6 27 affected boards.
  6 28    Currently, Code section 282.8 provides that tuition and
  6 29 transportation fees shall not be less than the lower average
  6 30 cost per pupil for the previous school year of the two
  6 31 affected school districts.  The bill amends the provision to
  6 32 establish that the tuition fee for students not requiring
  6 33 special education shall not be less than the lower of the
  6 34 tuition fee established pursuant to Code section 282.24 for
  6 35 students attending school outside the district of residence or
  7  1 the equivalent tuition rate for the non=Iowa school district
  7  2 for the previous school year, and the transportation fee
  7  3 established shall not be less than the lower average cost per
  7  4 mile for yellow school buses for the previous school year of
  7  5 the two affected school districts.  The bill also provides that
  7  6 if the tuition fee for the school district in the adjoining
  7  7 state is a variable rate, the test of which tuition fee is
  7  8 lower shall be determined for each student. For students
  7  9 requiring special education, the bill provides that the tuition
  7 10 fee shall be equal to the actual cost of the special education
  7 11 instructional program provided to that child under the child's
  7 12 individualized education program.
  7 13    If there is no agreement between districts, or if the
  7 14 distance requirements are not met, the bill provides that the
  7 15 tuition limitations of Code section 282.1 shall not apply,
  7 16 and a student attending school in the other state shall not
  7 17 be treated as a pupil of the district of residence in Iowa
  7 18 for purposes of tuition payments to the receiving district
  7 19 or for purposes of the school aid formula.  The bill further
  7 20 establishes that an agreement reached under Code section 282.8
  7 21 does not qualify as a whole grade sharing agreement and the
  7 22 open enrollment provisions do not apply to such an agreement.
  7 23    WHOLE GRADE SHARING AGREEMENTS.  Whole grade sharing
  7 24 is a procedure used by school districts in which all or a
  7 25 substantial portion of the pupils in any grade in two or
  7 26 more school districts share an educational program for all
  7 27 or a substantial portion of a school day under a written
  7 28 agreement.  Currently, the boards of the school districts
  7 29 participating in the agreement must negotiate, as part of
  7 30 the new or existing agreement, the disposition of funding
  7 31 provided under Code chapter 284, the student achievement and
  7 32 teacher quality program.  The bill provides exemptions from
  7 33 the disposition negotiation requirement relating to beginning
  7 34 teacher mentoring and induction funds; the teacher leadership
  7 35 supplement state cost per pupil, unless all of the districts
  8  1 subject to the agreement are receiving such funding; and the
  8  2 teacher leadership supplemental aid payments, unless all
  8  3 districts subject to the agreement are receiving such funding.
  8  4 Because the funding for the teacher leadership supplemental aid
  8  5 payments is scheduled to end with the 2016=2017 fiscal year,
  8  6 the bill repeals the relevant provision June 30, 2018.
  8  7    The bill also changes, from the third Friday of February to
  8  8 the second Friday of January of each year, the second of two
  8  9 dates used to determine the number of pupils participating in a
  8 10 whole grade sharing agreement.
  8 11    OPEN ENROLLMENT PAYMENTS.  In addition to other statutory
  8 12 requirements for open enrollment payments, the bill provides
  8 13 that the board of directors of the district of residence
  8 14 must pay to the receiving district the teacher leadership
  8 15 supplement state cost per pupil for the previous fiscal year
  8 16 or the teacher leadership supplement foundation aid for the
  8 17 previous fiscal year if both the district of residence and the
  8 18 receiving district are receiving such supplements.  Such a
  8 19 limitation currently exists in Code section 284.13, subsection
  8 20 1, paragraph "e", regarding the teacher leadership supplement
  8 21 foundation aid.  Currently, the district of residence must pay
  8 22 to the receiving district the teacher leadership supplement
  8 23 state cost per pupil for the previous fiscal year whether
  8 24 or not both districts are receiving the teacher leadership
  8 25 supplement state cost per pupil.
  8 26    Currently, a district of residence must make quarterly
  8 27 payments to the receiving district.  Under the bill, the
  8 28 receiving district must bill the district of residence
  8 29 biannually, and the district of residence must make payments
  8 30 in a timely manner.
  8 31    STATEWIDE PROGRESS REPORTS.  Currently, the department of
  8 32 education must make an annual report to the general assembly
  8 33 on statewide progress in student achievement on mathematics
  8 34 and reading at the fourth and eighth grades, on the evaluator
  8 35 training program, and on changes and improvements in teacher
  9  1 evaluations.  The bill eliminates that reporting requirement.
  9  2    STUDENT ACHIEVEMENT AND TEACHER QUALITY PROGRAM.  Currently,
  9  3 in developing administrative rules for consideration by the
  9  4 state board of education, the department must consult with
  9  5 persons representing teachers, administrators, school boards,
  9  6 approved practitioner preparation institutions, and other
  9  7 appropriate education stakeholders.  The bill provides that the
  9  8 department must consult stakeholders when those stakeholders
  9  9 might reasonably be affected by the proposed rule.
  9 10    TERMINOLOGY CHANGES.  Code sections 282.8 and 282.24 are
  9 11 amended to replace references to "elementary and high school"
  9 12 with the term "elementary and secondary school". Definitions
  9 13 for junior high school and high school are also stricken from
  9 14 Code section 282.24.
  9 15    REPEALS.  The bill repeals the following:

  9 34 to administer the program, establishing the program, and

  6 27 affected boards.
  6 28    Currently, Code section 282.8 provides that tuition and
  6 29 transportation fees shall not be less than the lower average
  6 30 cost per pupil for the previous school year of the two
  6 31 affected school districts.  The bill amends the provision to
  6 32 establish that the tuition fee for students not requiring
  6 33 special education shall not be less than the lower of the
  6 34 tuition fee established pursuant to Code section 282.24 for
  6 35 students attending school outside the district of residence or
  7  1 the equivalent tuition rate for the non=Iowa school district
  7  2 for the previous school year, and the transportation fee
  7  3 established shall not be less than the lower average cost per
  7  4 mile for yellow school buses for the previous school year of
  7  5 the two affected school districts.  The bill also provides that
  7  6 if the tuition fee for the school district in the adjoining
  7  7 state is a variable rate, the test of which tuition fee is
  7  8 lower shall be determined for each student. For students
  7  9 requiring special education, the bill provides that the tuition
  7 10 fee shall be equal to the actual cost of the special education
  7 11 instructional program provided to that child under the child's
  7 12 individualized education program.
  7 13    If there is no agreement between districts, or if the
  7 14 distance requirements are not met, the bill provides that the
  7 15 tuition limitations of Code section 282.1 shall not apply,
  7 16 and a student attending school in the other state shall not
  7 17 be treated as a pupil of the district of residence in Iowa
  7 18 for purposes of tuition payments to the receiving district
  7 19 or for purposes of the school aid formula.  The bill further
  7 20 establishes that an agreement reached under Code section 282.8
  7 21 does not qualify as a whole grade sharing agreement and the
  7 22 open enrollment provisions do not apply to such an agreement.
  7 23    WHOLE GRADE SHARING AGREEMENTS.  Whole grade sharing
  7 24 is a procedure used by school districts in which all or a
  7 25 substantial portion of the pupils in any grade in two or
  7 26 more school districts share an educational program for all
  7 27 or a substantial portion of a school day under a written
  7 28 agreement.  Currently, the boards of the school districts
  7 29 participating in the agreement must negotiate, as part of
  7 30 the new or existing agreement, the disposition of funding
  7 31 provided under Code chapter 284, the student achievement and
  7 32 teacher quality program.  The bill provides exemptions from
  7 33 the disposition negotiation requirement relating to beginning
  7 34 teacher mentoring and induction funds; the teacher leadership
  7 35 supplement state cost per pupil, unless all of the districts
  8  1 subject to the agreement are receiving such funding; and the
  8  2 teacher leadership supplemental aid payments, unless all
  8  3 districts subject to the agreement are receiving such funding.
  8  4 Because the funding for the teacher leadership supplemental aid
  8  5 payments is scheduled to end with the 2016=2017 fiscal year,
  8  6 the bill repeals the relevant provision June 30, 2018.
  8  7    The bill also changes, from the third Friday of February to
  8  8 the second Friday of January of each year, the second of two
  8  9 dates used to determine the number of pupils participating in a
  8 10 whole grade sharing agreement.
  8 11    OPEN ENROLLMENT PAYMENTS.  In addition to other statutory
  8 12 requirements for open enrollment payments, the bill provides
  8 13 that the board of directors of the district of residence
  8 14 must pay to the receiving district the teacher leadership
  8 15 supplement state cost per pupil for the previous fiscal year
  8 16 or the teacher leadership supplement foundation aid for the
  8 17 previous fiscal year if both the district of residence and the
  8 18 receiving district are receiving such supplements.  Such a
  8 19 limitation currently exists in Code section 284.13, subsection
  8 20 1, paragraph "e", regarding the teacher leadership supplement
  8 21 foundation aid.  Currently, the district of residence must pay
  8 22 to the receiving district the teacher leadership supplement
  8 23 state cost per pupil for the previous fiscal year whether
  8 24 or not both districts are receiving the teacher leadership
  8 25 supplement state cost per pupil.
  8 26    Currently, a district of residence must make quarterly
  8 27 payments to the receiving district.  Under the bill, the
  8 28 receiving district must bill the district of residence
  8 29 biannually, and the district of residence must make payments
  8 30 in a timely manner.
  8 31    STATEWIDE PROGRESS REPORTS.  Currently, the department of
  8 32 education must make an annual report to the general assembly
  8 33 on statewide progress in student achievement on mathematics
  8 34 and reading at the fourth and eighth grades, on the evaluator
  8 35 training program, and on changes and improvements in teacher
  9  1 evaluations.  The bill eliminates that reporting requirement.
  9  2    STUDENT ACHIEVEMENT AND TEACHER QUALITY PROGRAM.  Currently,
  9  3 in developing administrative rules for consideration by the
  9  4 state board of education, the department must consult with
  9  5 persons representing teachers, administrators, school boards,
  9  6 approved practitioner preparation institutions, and other
  9  7 appropriate education stakeholders.  The bill provides that the
  9  8 department must consult stakeholders when those stakeholders
  9  9 might reasonably be affected by the proposed rule.
  9 10    TERMINOLOGY CHANGES.  Code sections 282.8 and 282.24 are

  6 28    Currently, Code section 282.8 provides that tuition and
  6 29 transportation fees shall not be less than the lower average
  6 30 cost per pupil for the previous school year of the two

  7 13    If there is no agreement between districts, or if the

  7 15 tuition limitations of Code section 282.1 shall not apply,
  7 16 and a student attending school in the other state shall not
  7 17 be treated as a pupil of the district of residence in Iowa
  7 18 for purposes of tuition payments to the receiving district
  7 19 or for purposes of the school aid formula.  The bill further
  7 20 establishes that an agreement reached under Code section 282.8
  7 21 does not qualify as a whole grade sharing agreement and the
  7 22 open enrollment provisions do not apply to such an agreement.
  7 23    WHOLE GRADE SHARING AGREEMENTS.  Whole grade sharing
  7 24 is a procedure used by school districts in which all or a
  7 25 substantial portion of the pupils in any grade in two or
  7 26 more school districts share an educational program for all
  7 27 or a substantial portion of a school day under a written

  7 29 participating in the agreement must negotiate, as part of
  7 30 the new or existing agreement, the disposition of funding
  7 31 provided under Code chapter 284, the student achievement and
  7 32 teacher quality program.  The bill provides exemptions from
  7 33 the disposition negotiation requirement relating to beginning
  7 34 teacher mentoring and induction funds; the teacher leadership
  7 35 supplement state cost per pupil, unless all of the districts
  8  1 subject to the agreement are receiving such funding; and the
  8  2 teacher leadership supplemental aid payments, unless all
  8  3 districts subject to the agreement are receiving such funding.
  8  4 Because the funding for the teacher leadership supplemental aid
  8  5 payments is scheduled to end with the 2016=2017 fiscal year,
  8  6 the bill repeals the relevant provision June 30, 2018.
  8  7    The bill also changes, from the third Friday of February to
  8  8 the second Friday of January of each year, the second of two
  8  9 dates used to determine the number of pupils participating in a
  8 10 whole grade sharing agreement.
  8 11    OPEN ENROLLMENT PAYMENTS.  In addition to other statutory
  8 12 requirements for open enrollment payments, the bill provides
  8 13 that the board of directors of the district of residence
  8 14 must pay to the receiving district the teacher leadership
  8 15 supplement state cost per pupil for the previous fiscal year
  8 16 or the teacher leadership supplement foundation aid for the
  8 17 previous fiscal year if both the district of residence and the
  8 18 receiving district are receiving such supplements.  Such a
  8 19 limitation currently exists in Code section 284.13, subsection
  8 20 1, paragraph "e", regarding the teacher leadership supplement
  8 21 foundation aid.  Currently, the district of residence must pay
  8 22 to the receiving district the teacher leadership supplement
  8 23 state cost per pupil for the previous fiscal year whether
  8 24 or not both districts are receiving the teacher leadership
  8 25 supplement state cost per pupil.
  8 26    Currently, a district of residence must make quarterly
  8 27 payments to the receiving district.  Under the bill, the
  8 28 receiving district must bill the district of residence
  8 29 biannually, and the district of residence must make payments
  8 30 in a timely manner.
  8 31    STATEWIDE PROGRESS REPORTS.  Currently, the department of
  8 32 education must make an annual report to the general assembly
  8 33 on statewide progress in student achievement on mathematics
  8 34 and reading at the fourth and eighth grades, on the evaluator
  8 35 training program, and on changes and improvements in teacher

  9  2    STUDENT ACHIEVEMENT AND TEACHER QUALITY PROGRAM.  Currently,
  9  3 in developing administrative rules for consideration by the
  9  4 state board of education, the department must consult with
  9  5 persons representing teachers, administrators, school boards,
  9  6 approved practitioner preparation institutions, and other
  9  7 appropriate education stakeholders.  The bill provides that the
  9  8 department must consult stakeholders when those stakeholders
  9  9 might reasonably be affected by the proposed rule.

  7  9 requiring special education, the bill provides that the tuition
  7 10 fee shall be equal to the actual cost of the special education
  7 11 instructional program provided to that child under the child's
  7 12 individualized education program.
  7 13    If there is no agreement between districts, or if the
  7 14 distance requirements are not met, the bill provides that the
  7 15 tuition limitations of Code section 282.1 shall not apply,
  7 16 and a student attending school in the other state shall not
  7 17 be treated as a pupil of the district of residence in Iowa
  7 18 for purposes of tuition payments to the receiving district
  7 19 or for purposes of the school aid formula.  The bill further
  7 20 establishes that an agreement reached under Code section 282.8
  7 21 does not qualify as a whole grade sharing agreement and the
  7 22 open enrollment provisions do not apply to such an agreement.
  7 23    WHOLE GRADE SHARING AGREEMENTS.  Whole grade sharing
  7 24 is a procedure used by school districts in which all or a
  7 25 substantial portion of the pupils in any grade in two or
  7 26 more school districts share an educational program for all
  7 27 or a substantial portion of a school day under a written
  7 28 agreement.  Currently, the boards of the school districts
  7 29 participating in the agreement must negotiate, as part of
  7 30 the new or existing agreement, the disposition of funding
  7 31 provided under Code chapter 284, the student achievement and
  7 32 teacher quality program.  The bill provides exemptions from
  7 33 the disposition negotiation requirement relating to beginning
  7 34 teacher mentoring and induction funds; the teacher leadership
  7 35 supplement state cost per pupil, unless all of the districts
  8  1 subject to the agreement are receiving such funding; and the
  8  2 teacher leadership supplemental aid payments, unless all
  8  3 districts subject to the agreement are receiving such funding.
  8  4 Because the funding for the teacher leadership supplemental aid
  8  5 payments is scheduled to end with the 2016=2017 fiscal year,
  8  6 the bill repeals the relevant provision June 30, 2018.
  8  7    The bill also changes, from the third Friday of February to
  8  8 the second Friday of January of each year, the second of two
  8  9 dates used to determine the number of pupils participating in a
  8 10 whole grade sharing agreement.
  8 11    OPEN ENROLLMENT PAYMENTS.  In addition to other statutory
  8 12 requirements for open enrollment payments, the bill provides
  8 13 that the board of directors of the district of residence
  8 14 must pay to the receiving district the teacher leadership
  8 15 supplement state cost per pupil for the previous fiscal year
  8 16 or the teacher leadership supplement foundation aid for the
  8 17 previous fiscal year if both the district of residence and the
  8 18 receiving district are receiving such supplements.  Such a
  8 19 limitation currently exists in Code section 284.13, subsection
  8 20 1, paragraph "e", regarding the teacher leadership supplement
  8 21 foundation aid.  Currently, the district of residence must pay
  8 22 to the receiving district the teacher leadership supplement
  8 23 state cost per pupil for the previous fiscal year whether
  8 24 or not both districts are receiving the teacher leadership
  8 25 supplement state cost per pupil.
  8 26    Currently, a district of residence must make quarterly
  8 27 payments to the receiving district.  Under the bill, the
  8 28 receiving district must bill the district of residence
  8 29 biannually, and the district of residence must make payments
  8 30 in a timely manner.
  8 31    STATEWIDE PROGRESS REPORTS.  Currently, the department of
  8 32 education must make an annual report to the general assembly
  8 33 on statewide progress in student achievement on mathematics
  8 34 and reading at the fourth and eighth grades, on the evaluator
  8 35 training program, and on changes and improvements in teacher
  9  1 evaluations.  The bill eliminates that reporting requirement.
  9  2    STUDENT ACHIEVEMENT AND TEACHER QUALITY PROGRAM.  Currently,
  9  3 in developing administrative rules for consideration by the
  9  4 state board of education, the department must consult with
  9  5 persons representing teachers, administrators, school boards,
  9  6 approved practitioner preparation institutions, and other
  9  7 appropriate education stakeholders.  The bill provides that the
  9  8 department must consult stakeholders when those stakeholders
  9  9 might reasonably be affected by the proposed rule.
  9 10    TERMINOLOGY CHANGES.  Code sections 282.8 and 282.24 are
  9 11 amended to replace references to "elementary and high school"
  9 12 with the term "elementary and secondary school". Definitions
  9 13 for junior high school and high school are also stricken from
  9 14 Code section 282.24.
  9 15    REPEALS.  The bill repeals the following:
  9 16    1.  PILOT PROJECTS TO IMPROVE INSTRUCTIONAL PROGRAMS.  When
  9 17 first enacted in 1987, the provision was part of a program
  9 18 to offer incentives to school districts that established
  9 19 pilot projects to utilize a modified block schedule for
  9 20 offering classes in the districts and sharing the certificated
  9 21 instructional personnel.  Implementation by the department
  9 22 of education is dependent on whether the general assembly
  9 23 appropriates funding for the pilot projects.
  9 24    2.  TEACHER EXCHANGE PROGRAM.  The teacher exchange program
  9 25 was enacted in 1991, contingent on an appropriation of moneys
  9 26 by the general assembly, to permit school districts to exchange
  9 27 licensed instructional personnel with other districts in order
  9 28 to promote the exchange and enhancement of instructional
  9 29 methods and materials and encourage the educational development
  9 30 of Iowa's teachers.  The bill eliminates the provisions
  9 31 relating to the teacher exchange program, including provisions
  9 32 directing the state board to adopt rules to administer the
  9 33 program, directing the director of the department of education
  9 34 to administer the program, establishing the program, and
  9 35 providing for participation in the program by school districts
 10  1 and teachers.

       kh/sc
  6 26 tuition and transportation fees in an amount acceptable to the
  6 27 affected boards.
  6 28    Currently, Code section 282.8 provides that tuition and
  6 29 transportation fees shall not be less than the lower average
  6 30 cost per pupil for the previous school year of the two
  6 31 affected school districts.  The bill amends the provision to
  6 32 establish that the tuition fee for students not requiring
  6 33 special education shall not be less than the lower of the
  6 34 tuition fee established pursuant to Code section 282.24 for
  6 35 students attending school outside the district of residence or
  7  1 the equivalent tuition rate for the non=Iowa school district
  7  2 for the previous school year, and the transportation fee
  7  3 established shall not be less than the lower average cost per
  7  4 mile for yellow school buses for the previous school year of
  7  5 the two affected school districts.  The bill also provides that
  7  6 if the tuition fee for the school district in the adjoining
  7  7 state is a variable rate, the test of which tuition fee is
  7  8 lower shall be determined for each student. For students
  7  9 requiring special education, the bill provides that the tuition
  7 10 fee shall be equal to the actual cost of the special education
  7 11 instructional program provided to that child under the child's
  7 12 individualized education program.
  7 13    If there is no agreement between districts, or if the
  7 14 distance requirements are not met, the bill provides that the
  7 15 tuition limitations of Code section 282.1 shall not apply,
  7 16 and a student attending school in the other state shall not
  7 17 be treated as a pupil of the district of residence in Iowa
  7 18 for purposes of tuition payments to the receiving district
  7 19 or for purposes of the school aid formula.  The bill further
  7 20 establishes that an agreement reached under Code section 282.8
  7 21 does not qualify as a whole grade sharing agreement and the
  7 22 open enrollment provisions do not apply to such an agreement.
  7 23    WHOLE GRADE SHARING AGREEMENTS.  Whole grade sharing
  7 24 is a procedure used by school districts in which all or a
  7 25 substantial portion of the pupils in any grade in two or
  7 26 more school districts share an educational program for all
  7 27 or a substantial portion of a school day under a written
  7 28 agreement.  Currently, the boards of the school districts
  7 29 participating in the agreement must negotiate, as part of
  7 30 the new or existing agreement, the disposition of funding
  7 31 provided under Code chapter 284, the student achievement and
  7 32 teacher quality program.  The bill provides exemptions from
  7 33 the disposition negotiation requirement relating to beginning
  7 34 teacher mentoring and induction funds; the teacher leadership
  7 35 supplement state cost per pupil, unless all of the districts
  8  1 subject to the agreement are receiving such funding; and the
  8  2 teacher leadership supplemental aid payments, unless all
  8  3 districts subject to the agreement are receiving such funding.
  8  4 Because the funding for the teacher leadership supplemental aid
  8  5 payments is scheduled to end with the 2016=2017 fiscal year,
  8  6 the bill repeals the relevant provision June 30, 2018.
  8  7    The bill also changes, from the third Friday of February to
  8  8 the second Friday of January of each year, the second of two
  8  9 dates used to determine the number of pupils participating in a
  8 10 whole grade sharing agreement.
  8 11    OPEN ENROLLMENT PAYMENTS.  In addition to other statutory
  8 12 requirements for open enrollment payments, the bill provides
  8 13 that the board of directors of the district of residence
  8 14 must pay to the receiving district the teacher leadership
  8 15 supplement state cost per pupil for the previous fiscal year
  8 16 or the teacher leadership supplement foundation aid for the
  8 17 previous fiscal year if both the district of residence and the
  8 18 receiving district are receiving such supplements.  Such a
  8 19 limitation currently exists in Code section 284.13, subsection
  8 20 1, paragraph "e", regarding the teacher leadership supplement
  8 21 foundation aid.  Currently, the district of residence must pay
  8 22 to the receiving district the teacher leadership supplement
  8 23 state cost per pupil for the previous fiscal year whether
  8 24 or not both districts are receiving the teacher leadership
  8 25 supplement state cost per pupil.
  8 26    Currently, a district of residence must make quarterly
  8 27 payments to the receiving district.  Under the bill, the
  8 28 receiving district must bill the district of residence
  8 29 biannually, and the district of residence must make payments
  8 30 in a timely manner.
  8 31    STATEWIDE PROGRESS REPORTS.  Currently, the department of
  8 32 education must make an annual report to the general assembly
  8 33 on statewide progress in student achievement on mathematics
  8 34 and reading at the fourth and eighth grades, on the evaluator
  8 35 training program, and on changes and improvements in teacher
  9  1 evaluations.  The bill eliminates that reporting requirement.
  9  2    STUDENT ACHIEVEMENT AND TEACHER QUALITY PROGRAM.  Currently,
  9  3 in developing administrative rules for consideration by the
  9  4 state board of education, the department must consult with
  9  5 persons representing teachers, administrators, school boards,
  9  6 approved practitioner preparation institutions, and other
  9  7 appropriate education stakeholders.  The bill provides that the
  9  8 department must consult stakeholders when those stakeholders
  9  9 might reasonably be affected by the proposed rule.
  9 10    TERMINOLOGY CHANGES.  Code sections 282.8 and 282.24 are
  9 11 amended to replace references to "elementary and high school"
  9 12 with the term "elementary and secondary school". Definitions
  9 13 for junior high school and high school are also stricken from
  9 14 Code section 282.24.

  7 13    If there is no agreement between districts, or if the

  9 21 instructional personnel.  Implementation by the department
  9 22 of education is dependent on whether the general assembly
  9 23 appropriates funding for the pilot projects.
  9 24    2.  TEACHER EXCHANGE PROGRAM.  The teacher exchange program
  9 25 was enacted in 1991, contingent on an appropriation of moneys
  9 26 by the general assembly, to permit school districts to exchange
  9 27 licensed instructional personnel with other districts in order
  9 28 to promote the exchange and enhancement of instructional
  9 29 methods and materials and encourage the educational development
  9 30 of Iowa's teachers.  The bill eliminates the provisions
  9 31 relating to the teacher exchange program, including provisions
  9 32 directing the state board to adopt rules to administer the
  9 33 program, directing the director of the department of education
  9 34 to administer the program, establishing the program, and
  9 35 providing for participation in the program by school districts
 10  1 and teachers.

  6 29 transportation fees shall not be less than the lower average
  6 30 cost per pupil for the previous school year of the two
  6 31 affected school districts.  The bill amends the provision to
  6 32 establish that the tuition fee for students not requiring
  6 33 special education shall not be less than the lower of the
  6 34 tuition fee established pursuant to Code section 282.24 for
  6 35 students attending school outside the district of residence or
  7  1 the equivalent tuition rate for the non=Iowa school district
  7  2 for the previous school year, and the transportation fee
  7  3 established shall not be less than the lower average cost per
  7  4 mile for yellow school buses for the previous school year of
  7  5 the two affected school districts.  The bill also provides that
  7  6 if the tuition fee for the school district in the adjoining
  7  7 state is a variable rate, the test of which tuition fee is
  7  8 lower shall be determined for each student. For students
  7  9 requiring special education, the bill provides that the tuition
  7 10 fee shall be equal to the actual cost of the special education
  7 11 instructional program provided to that child under the child's
  7 12 individualized education program.
  7 13    If there is no agreement between districts, or if the
  7 14 distance requirements are not met, the bill provides that the
  7 15 tuition limitations of Code section 282.1 shall not apply,
  7 16 and a student attending school in the other state shall not
  7 17 be treated as a pupil of the district of residence in Iowa
  7 18 for purposes of tuition payments to the receiving district
  7 19 or for purposes of the school aid formula.  The bill further
  7 20 establishes that an agreement reached under Code section 282.8
  7 21 does not qualify as a whole grade sharing agreement and the
  7 22 open enrollment provisions do not apply to such an agreement.
  7 23    WHOLE GRADE SHARING AGREEMENTS.  Whole grade sharing
  7 24 is a procedure used by school districts in which all or a
  7 25 substantial portion of the pupils in any grade in two or
  7 26 more school districts share an educational program for all
  7 27 or a substantial portion of a school day under a written
  7 28 agreement.  Currently, the boards of the school districts
  7 29 participating in the agreement must negotiate, as part of
  7 30 the new or existing agreement, the disposition of funding
  7 31 provided under Code chapter 284, the student achievement and
  7 32 teacher quality program.  The bill provides exemptions from
  7 33 the disposition negotiation requirement relating to beginning
  7 34 teacher mentoring and induction funds; the teacher leadership
  7 35 supplement state cost per pupil, unless all of the districts
  8  1 subject to the agreement are receiving such funding; and the
  8  2 teacher leadership supplemental aid payments, unless all
  8  3 districts subject to the agreement are receiving such funding.
  8  4 Because the funding for the teacher leadership supplemental aid
  8  5 payments is scheduled to end with the 2016=2017 fiscal year,
  8  6 the bill repeals the relevant provision June 30, 2018.
  8  7    The bill also changes, from the third Friday of February to
  8  8 the second Friday of January of each year, the second of two
  8  9 dates used to determine the number of pupils participating in a
  8 10 whole grade sharing agreement.
  8 11    OPEN ENROLLMENT PAYMENTS.  In addition to other statutory
  8 12 requirements for open enrollment payments, the bill provides
  8 13 that the board of directors of the district of residence
  8 14 must pay to the receiving district the teacher leadership
  8 15 supplement state cost per pupil for the previous fiscal year
  8 16 or the teacher leadership supplement foundation aid for the
  8 17 previous fiscal year if both the district of residence and the
  8 18 receiving district are receiving such supplements.  Such a
  8 19 limitation currently exists in Code section 284.13, subsection
  8 20 1, paragraph "e", regarding the teacher leadership supplement
  8 21 foundation aid.  Currently, the district of residence must pay
  8 22 to the receiving district the teacher leadership supplement
  8 23 state cost per pupil for the previous fiscal year whether
  8 24 or not both districts are receiving the teacher leadership
  8 25 supplement state cost per pupil.
  8 26    Currently, a district of residence must make quarterly
  8 27 payments to the receiving district.  Under the bill, the
  8 28 receiving district must bill the district of residence
  8 29 biannually, and the district of residence must make payments
  8 30 in a timely manner.
  8 31    STATEWIDE PROGRESS REPORTS.  Currently, the department of
  8 32 education must make an annual report to the general assembly
  8 33 on statewide progress in student achievement on mathematics
  8 34 and reading at the fourth and eighth grades, on the evaluator
  8 35 training program, and on changes and improvements in teacher
  9  1 evaluations.  The bill eliminates that reporting requirement.
  9  2    STUDENT ACHIEVEMENT AND TEACHER QUALITY PROGRAM.  Currently,
  9  3 in developing administrative rules for consideration by the
  9  4 state board of education, the department must consult with
  9  5 persons representing teachers, administrators, school boards,
  9  6 approved practitioner preparation institutions, and other
  9  7 appropriate education stakeholders.  The bill provides that the
  9  8 department must consult stakeholders when those stakeholders
  9  9 might reasonably be affected by the proposed rule.
  9 10    TERMINOLOGY CHANGES.  Code sections 282.8 and 282.24 are
  9 11 amended to replace references to "elementary and high school"
  9 12 with the term "elementary and secondary school". Definitions
  9 13 for junior high school and high school are also stricken from
  9 14 Code section 282.24.
  9 15    REPEALS.  The bill repeals the following:
  9 16    1.  PILOT PROJECTS TO IMPROVE INSTRUCTIONAL PROGRAMS.  When
  9 17 first enacted in 1987, the provision was part of a program
  9 18 to offer incentives to school districts that established
  9 19 pilot projects to utilize a modified block schedule for
  9 20 offering classes in the districts and sharing the certificated
  9 21 instructional personnel.  Implementation by the department
  9 22 of education is dependent on whether the general assembly

  7  9 requiring special education, the bill provides that the tuition

  7 13    If there is no agreement between districts, or if the

  7 16 and a student attending school in the other state shall not
  7 17 be treated as a pupil of the district of residence in Iowa
  7 18 for purposes of tuition payments to the receiving district
  7 19 or for purposes of the school aid formula.  The bill further
  7 20 establishes that an agreement reached under Code section 282.8
  7 21 does not qualify as a whole grade sharing agreement and the
  7 22 open enrollment provisions do not apply to such an agreement.
  7 23    WHOLE GRADE SHARING AGREEMENTS.  Whole grade sharing
  7 24 is a procedure used by school districts in which all or a

  8  5 payments is scheduled to end with the 2016=2017 fiscal year,

  8 12 requirements for open enrollment payments, the bill provides
  8 13 that the board of directors of the district of residence
  8 14 must pay to the receiving district the teacher leadership

  8 23 state cost per pupil for the previous fiscal year whether
  8 24 or not both districts are receiving the teacher leadership
  8 25 supplement state cost per pupil.
  8 26    Currently, a district of residence must make quarterly
  8 27 payments to the receiving district.  Under the bill, the

  9  2    STUDENT ACHIEVEMENT AND TEACHER QUALITY PROGRAM.  Currently,
  9  3 in developing administrative rules for consideration by the
  9  4 state board of education, the department must consult with
  9  5 persons representing teachers, administrators, school boards,
  9  6 approved practitioner preparation institutions, and other
  9  7 appropriate education stakeholders.  The bill provides that the
  9  8 department must consult stakeholders when those stakeholders
  9  9 might reasonably be affected by the proposed rule.
  9 10    TERMINOLOGY CHANGES.  Code sections 282.8 and 282.24 are
  9 11 amended to replace references to "elementary and high school"
  9 12 with the term "elementary and secondary school". Definitions
  9 13 for junior high school and high school are also stricken from
  9 14 Code section 282.24.
  9 15    REPEALS.  The bill repeals the following:
  9 16    1.  PILOT PROJECTS TO IMPROVE INSTRUCTIONAL PROGRAMS.  When
  9 17 first enacted in 1987, the provision was part of a program
  9 18 to offer incentives to school districts that established
  9 19 pilot projects to utilize a modified block schedule for
  9 20 offering classes in the districts and sharing the certificated
  9 21 instructional personnel.  Implementation by the department
  9 22 of education is dependent on whether the general assembly
  9 23 appropriates funding for the pilot projects.
  9 24    2.  TEACHER EXCHANGE PROGRAM.  The teacher exchange program
  9 25 was enacted in 1991, contingent on an appropriation of moneys
  9 26 by the general assembly, to permit school districts to exchange
  9 27 licensed instructional personnel with other districts in order
  9 28 to promote the exchange and enhancement of instructional
  9 29 methods and materials and encourage the educational development
  9 30 of Iowa's teachers.  The bill eliminates the provisions
  9 31 relating to the teacher exchange program, including provisions
  9 32 directing the state board to adopt rules to administer the
  9 33 program, directing the director of the department of education
  9 34 to administer the program, establishing the program, and
  9 35 providing for participation in the program by school districts
 10  1 and teachers.

  6 33 special education shall not be less than the lower of the

  6 35 students attending school outside the district of residence or
  7  1 the equivalent tuition rate for the non=Iowa school district
  7  2 for the previous school year, and the transportation fee
  7  3 established shall not be less than the lower average cost per
  7  4 mile for yellow school buses for the previous school year of
  7  5 the two affected school districts.  The bill also provides that
  7  6 if the tuition fee for the school district in the adjoining
  7  7 state is a variable rate, the test of which tuition fee is
  7  8 lower shall be determined for each student. For students
  7  9 requiring special education, the bill provides that the tuition
  7 10 fee shall be equal to the actual cost of the special education
  7 11 instructional program provided to that child under the child's
  7 12 individualized education program.
  7 13    If there is no agreement between districts, or if the
  7 14 distance requirements are not met, the bill provides that the
  7 15 tuition limitations of Code section 282.1 shall not apply,
  7 16 and a student attending school in the other state shall not
  7 17 be treated as a pupil of the district of residence in Iowa
  7 18 for purposes of tuition payments to the receiving district
  7 19 or for purposes of the school aid formula.  The bill further
  7 20 establishes that an agreement reached under Code section 282.8
  7 21 does not qualify as a whole grade sharing agreement and the
  7 22 open enrollment provisions do not apply to such an agreement.
  7 23    WHOLE GRADE SHARING AGREEMENTS.  Whole grade sharing
  7 24 is a procedure used by school districts in which all or a
  7 25 substantial portion of the pupils in any grade in two or
  7 26 more school districts share an educational program for all
  7 27 or a substantial portion of a school day under a written
  7 28 agreement.  Currently, the boards of the school districts
  7 29 participating in the agreement must negotiate, as part of
  7 30 the new or existing agreement, the disposition of funding
  7 31 provided under Code chapter 284, the student achievement and
  7 32 teacher quality program.  The bill provides exemptions from
  7 33 the disposition negotiation requirement relating to beginning
  7 34 teacher mentoring and induction funds; the teacher leadership
  7 35 supplement state cost per pupil, unless all of the districts
  8  1 subject to the agreement are receiving such funding; and the
  8  2 teacher leadership supplemental aid payments, unless all
  8  3 districts subject to the agreement are receiving such funding.
  8  4 Because the funding for the teacher leadership supplemental aid
  8  5 payments is scheduled to end with the 2016=2017 fiscal year,
  8  6 the bill repeals the relevant provision June 30, 2018.
  8  7    The bill also changes, from the third Friday of February to
  8  8 the second Friday of January of each year, the second of two
  8  9 dates used to determine the number of pupils participating in a
  8 10 whole grade sharing agreement.
  8 11    OPEN ENROLLMENT PAYMENTS.  In addition to other statutory
  8 12 requirements for open enrollment payments, the bill provides
  8 13 that the board of directors of the district of residence
  8 14 must pay to the receiving district the teacher leadership
  8 15 supplement state cost per pupil for the previous fiscal year
  8 16 or the teacher leadership supplement foundation aid for the
  8 17 previous fiscal year if both the district of residence and the
  8 18 receiving district are receiving such supplements.  Such a
  8 19 limitation currently exists in Code section 284.13, subsection
  8 20 1, paragraph "e", regarding the teacher leadership supplement
  8 21 foundation aid.  Currently, the district of residence must pay
  8 22 to the receiving district the teacher leadership supplement
  8 23 state cost per pupil for the previous fiscal year whether
  8 24 or not both districts are receiving the teacher leadership
  8 25 supplement state cost per pupil.
  8 26    Currently, a district of residence must make quarterly
  8 27 payments to the receiving district.  Under the bill, the
  8 28 receiving district must bill the district of residence
  8 29 biannually, and the district of residence must make payments
  8 30 in a timely manner.
  8 31    STATEWIDE PROGRESS REPORTS.  Currently, the department of
  8 32 education must make an annual report to the general assembly
  8 33 on statewide progress in student achievement on mathematics
  8 34 and reading at the fourth and eighth grades, on the evaluator
  8 35 training program, and on changes and improvements in teacher
  9  1 evaluations.  The bill eliminates that reporting requirement.
  9  2    STUDENT ACHIEVEMENT AND TEACHER QUALITY PROGRAM.  Currently,
  9  3 in developing administrative rules for consideration by the
  9  4 state board of education, the department must consult with
  9  5 persons representing teachers, administrators, school boards,
  9  6 approved practitioner preparation institutions, and other

  9  9 might reasonably be affected by the proposed rule.

  8 33 on statewide progress in student achievement on mathematics
  8 34 and reading at the fourth and eighth grades, on the evaluator
  8 35 training program, and on changes and improvements in teacher
  9  1 evaluations.  The bill eliminates that reporting requirement.
  9  2    STUDENT ACHIEVEMENT AND TEACHER QUALITY PROGRAM.  Currently,
  9  3 in developing administrative rules for consideration by the
  9  4 state board of education, the department must consult with
  9  5 persons representing teachers, administrators, school boards,
  9  6 approved practitioner preparation institutions, and other
  9  7 appropriate education stakeholders.  The bill provides that the
  9  8 department must consult stakeholders when those stakeholders
  9  9 might reasonably be affected by the proposed rule.
  9 10    TERMINOLOGY CHANGES.  Code sections 282.8 and 282.24 are
  9 11 amended to replace references to "elementary and high school"
  9 12 with the term "elementary and secondary school". Definitions
  9 13 for junior high school and high school are also stricken from
  9 14 Code section 282.24.
  9 15    REPEALS.  The bill repeals the following:
  9 16    1.  PILOT PROJECTS TO IMPROVE INSTRUCTIONAL PROGRAMS.  When
  9 17 first enacted in 1987, the provision was part of a program
  9 18 to offer incentives to school districts that established
  9 19 pilot projects to utilize a modified block schedule for
  9 20 offering classes in the districts and sharing the certificated
  9 21 instructional personnel.  Implementation by the department
  9 22 of education is dependent on whether the general assembly
  9 23 appropriates funding for the pilot projects.
  9 24    2.  TEACHER EXCHANGE PROGRAM.  The teacher exchange program
  9 25 was enacted in 1991, contingent on an appropriation of moneys
  9 26 by the general assembly, to permit school districts to exchange
  9 27 licensed instructional personnel with other districts in order
  9 28 to promote the exchange and enhancement of instructional
  9 29 methods and materials and encourage the educational development
  9 30 of Iowa's teachers.  The bill eliminates the provisions
  9 31 relating to the teacher exchange program, including provisions
  9 32 directing the state board to adopt rules to administer the
  9 33 program, directing the director of the department of education
  9 34 to administer the program, establishing the program, and
  9 35 providing for participation in the program by school districts
 10  1 and teachers.

  7  2 for the previous school year, and the transportation fee
  7  3 established shall not be less than the lower average cost per
  7  4 mile for yellow school buses for the previous school year of
  7  5 the two affected school districts.  The bill also provides that
  7  6 if the tuition fee for the school district in the adjoining
  7  7 state is a variable rate, the test of which tuition fee is
  7  8 lower shall be determined for each student. For students
  7  9 requiring special education, the bill provides that the tuition
  7 10 fee shall be equal to the actual cost of the special education
  7 11 instructional program provided to that child under the child's
  7 12 individualized education program.
  7 13    If there is no agreement between districts, or if the
  7 14 distance requirements are not met, the bill provides that the
  7 15 tuition limitations of Code section 282.1 shall not apply,
  7 16 and a student attending school in the other state shall not
  7 17 be treated as a pupil of the district of residence in Iowa
  7 18 for purposes of tuition payments to the receiving district
  7 19 or for purposes of the school aid formula.  The bill further
  7 20 establishes that an agreement reached under Code section 282.8
  7 21 does not qualify as a whole grade sharing agreement and the
  7 22 open enrollment provisions do not apply to such an agreement.
  7 23    WHOLE GRADE SHARING AGREEMENTS.  Whole grade sharing
  7 24 is a procedure used by school districts in which all or a
  7 25 substantial portion of the pupils in any grade in two or
  7 26 more school districts share an educational program for all
  7 27 or a substantial portion of a school day under a written
  7 28 agreement.  Currently, the boards of the school districts
  7 29 participating in the agreement must negotiate, as part of
  7 30 the new or existing agreement, the disposition of funding
  7 31 provided under Code chapter 284, the student achievement and
  7 32 teacher quality program.  The bill provides exemptions from
  7 33 the disposition negotiation requirement relating to beginning
  7 34 teacher mentoring and induction funds; the teacher leadership
  7 35 supplement state cost per pupil, unless all of the districts
  8  1 subject to the agreement are receiving such funding; and the
  8  2 teacher leadership supplemental aid payments, unless all
  8  3 districts subject to the agreement are receiving such funding.
  8  4 Because the funding for the teacher leadership supplemental aid
  8  5 payments is scheduled to end with the 2016=2017 fiscal year,
  8  6 the bill repeals the relevant provision June 30, 2018.
  8  7    The bill also changes, from the third Friday of February to
  8  8 the second Friday of January of each year, the second of two
  8  9 dates used to determine the number of pupils participating in a
  8 10 whole grade sharing agreement.
  8 11    OPEN ENROLLMENT PAYMENTS.  In addition to other statutory
  8 12 requirements for open enrollment payments, the bill provides
  8 13 that the board of directors of the district of residence
  8 14 must pay to the receiving district the teacher leadership
  8 15 supplement state cost per pupil for the previous fiscal year
  8 16 or the teacher leadership supplement foundation aid for the
  8 17 previous fiscal year if both the district of residence and the
  8 18 receiving district are receiving such supplements.  Such a
  8 19 limitation currently exists in Code section 284.13, subsection
  8 20 1, paragraph "e", regarding the teacher leadership supplement
  8 21 foundation aid.  Currently, the district of residence must pay
  8 22 to the receiving district the teacher leadership supplement
  8 23 state cost per pupil for the previous fiscal year whether
  8 24 or not both districts are receiving the teacher leadership
  8 25 supplement state cost per pupil.
  8 26    Currently, a district of residence must make quarterly
  8 27 payments to the receiving district.  Under the bill, the
  8 28 receiving district must bill the district of residence
  8 29 biannually, and the district of residence must make payments
  8 30 in a timely manner.
  8 31    STATEWIDE PROGRESS REPORTS.  Currently, the department of
  8 32 education must make an annual report to the general assembly
  8 33 on statewide progress in student achievement on mathematics

  9 15    REPEALS.  The bill repeals the following:
  9 16    1.  PILOT PROJECTS TO IMPROVE INSTRUCTIONAL PROGRAMS.  When
  9 17 first enacted in 1987, the provision was part of a program
  9 18 to offer incentives to school districts that established
  9 19 pilot projects to utilize a modified block schedule for
  9 20 offering classes in the districts and sharing the certificated
  9 21 instructional personnel.  Implementation by the department
  9 22 of education is dependent on whether the general assembly
  9 23 appropriates funding for the pilot projects.
  9 24    2.  TEACHER EXCHANGE PROGRAM.  The teacher exchange program
  9 25 was enacted in 1991, contingent on an appropriation of moneys
  9 26 by the general assembly, to permit school districts to exchange
  9 27 licensed instructional personnel with other districts in order
  9 28 to promote the exchange and enhancement of instructional
  9 29 methods and materials and encourage the educational development
  9 30 of Iowa's teachers.  The bill eliminates the provisions
  9 31 relating to the teacher exchange program, including provisions
  9 32 directing the state board to adopt rules to administer the
  9 33 program, directing the director of the department of education
  9 34 to administer the program, establishing the program, and
  9 35 providing for participation in the program by school districts
 10  1 and teachers.

  7  7 state is a variable rate, the test of which tuition fee is

  7  9 requiring special education, the bill provides that the tuition
  7 10 fee shall be equal to the actual cost of the special education
  7 11 instructional program provided to that child under the child's
  7 12 individualized education program.
  7 13    If there is no agreement between districts, or if the
  7 14 distance requirements are not met, the bill provides that the
  7 15 tuition limitations of Code section 282.1 shall not apply,
  7 16 and a student attending school in the other state shall not
  7 17 be treated as a pupil of the district of residence in Iowa
  7 18 for purposes of tuition payments to the receiving district
  7 19 or for purposes of the school aid formula.  The bill further
  7 20 establishes that an agreement reached under Code section 282.8
  7 21 does not qualify as a whole grade sharing agreement and the
  7 22 open enrollment provisions do not apply to such an agreement.
  7 23    WHOLE GRADE SHARING AGREEMENTS.  Whole grade sharing
  7 24 is a procedure used by school districts in which all or a
  7 25 substantial portion of the pupils in any grade in two or
  7 26 more school districts share an educational program for all
  7 27 or a substantial portion of a school day under a written
  7 28 agreement.  Currently, the boards of the school districts
  7 29 participating in the agreement must negotiate, as part of
  7 30 the new or existing agreement, the disposition of funding
  7 31 provided under Code chapter 284, the student achievement and
  7 32 teacher quality program.  The bill provides exemptions from
  7 33 the disposition negotiation requirement relating to beginning
  7 34 teacher mentoring and induction funds; the teacher leadership
  7 35 supplement state cost per pupil, unless all of the districts
  8  1 subject to the agreement are receiving such funding; and the
  8  2 teacher leadership supplemental aid payments, unless all
  8  3 districts subject to the agreement are receiving such funding.
  8  4 Because the funding for the teacher leadership supplemental aid
  8  5 payments is scheduled to end with the 2016=2017 fiscal year,
  8  6 the bill repeals the relevant provision June 30, 2018.
  8  7    The bill also changes, from the third Friday of February to
  8  8 the second Friday of January of each year, the second of two
  8  9 dates used to determine the number of pupils participating in a
  8 10 whole grade sharing agreement.
  8 11    OPEN ENROLLMENT PAYMENTS.  In addition to other statutory
  8 12 requirements for open enrollment payments, the bill provides
  8 13 that the board of directors of the district of residence
  8 14 must pay to the receiving district the teacher leadership
  8 15 supplement state cost per pupil for the previous fiscal year
  8 16 or the teacher leadership supplement foundation aid for the
  8 17 previous fiscal year if both the district of residence and the
  8 18 receiving district are receiving such supplements.  Such a
  8 19 limitation currently exists in Code section 284.13, subsection
  8 20 1, paragraph "e", regarding the teacher leadership supplement
  8 21 foundation aid.  Currently, the district of residence must pay
  8 22 to the receiving district the teacher leadership supplement
  8 23 state cost per pupil for the previous fiscal year whether
  8 24 or not both districts are receiving the teacher leadership
  8 25 supplement state cost per pupil.
  8 26    Currently, a district of residence must make quarterly
  8 27 payments to the receiving district.  Under the bill, the
  8 28 receiving district must bill the district of residence
  8 29 biannually, and the district of residence must make payments
  8 30 in a timely manner.
  8 31    STATEWIDE PROGRESS REPORTS.  Currently, the department of
  8 32 education must make an annual report to the general assembly
  8 33 on statewide progress in student achievement on mathematics
  8 34 and reading at the fourth and eighth grades, on the evaluator
  8 35 training program, and on changes and improvements in teacher
  9  1 evaluations.  The bill eliminates that reporting requirement.
  9  2    STUDENT ACHIEVEMENT AND TEACHER QUALITY PROGRAM.  Currently,
  9  3 in developing administrative rules for consideration by the
  9  4 state board of education, the department must consult with
  9  5 persons representing teachers, administrators, school boards,
  9  6 approved practitioner preparation institutions, and other
  9  7 appropriate education stakeholders.  The bill provides that the
  9  8 department must consult stakeholders when those stakeholders

  7 10 fee shall be equal to the actual cost of the special education
  7 11 instructional program provided to that child under the child's
  7 12 individualized education program.
  7 13    If there is no agreement between districts, or if the
  7 14 distance requirements are not met, the bill provides that the
  7 15 tuition limitations of Code section 282.1 shall not apply,
  7 16 and a student attending school in the other state shall not
  7 17 be treated as a pupil of the district of residence in Iowa
  7 18 for purposes of tuition payments to the receiving district
  7 19 or for purposes of the school aid formula.  The bill further
  7 20 establishes that an agreement reached under Code section 282.8
  7 21 does not qualify as a whole grade sharing agreement and the
  7 22 open enrollment provisions do not apply to such an agreement.
  7 23    WHOLE GRADE SHARING AGREEMENTS.  Whole grade sharing
  7 24 is a procedure used by school districts in which all or a
  7 25 substantial portion of the pupils in any grade in two or
  7 26 more school districts share an educational program for all
  7 27 or a substantial portion of a school day under a written
  7 28 agreement.  Currently, the boards of the school districts
  7 29 participating in the agreement must negotiate, as part of
  7 30 the new or existing agreement, the disposition of funding
  7 31 provided under Code chapter 284, the student achievement and
  7 32 teacher quality program.  The bill provides exemptions from
  7 33 the disposition negotiation requirement relating to beginning
  7 34 teacher mentoring and induction funds; the teacher leadership
  7 35 supplement state cost per pupil, unless all of the districts
  8  1 subject to the agreement are receiving such funding; and the
  8  2 teacher leadership supplemental aid payments, unless all
  8  3 districts subject to the agreement are receiving such funding.
  8  4 Because the funding for the teacher leadership supplemental aid
  8  5 payments is scheduled to end with the 2016=2017 fiscal year,
  8  6 the bill repeals the relevant provision June 30, 2018.
  8  7    The bill also changes, from the third Friday of February to
  8  8 the second Friday of January of each year, the second of two
  8  9 dates used to determine the number of pupils participating in a
  8 10 whole grade sharing agreement.
  8 11    OPEN ENROLLMENT PAYMENTS.  In addition to other statutory
  8 12 requirements for open enrollment payments, the bill provides
  8 13 that the board of directors of the district of residence
  8 14 must pay to the receiving district the teacher leadership
  8 15 supplement state cost per pupil for the previous fiscal year
  8 16 or the teacher leadership supplement foundation aid for the
  8 17 previous fiscal year if both the district of residence and the
  8 18 receiving district are receiving such supplements.  Such a
  8 19 limitation currently exists in Code section 284.13, subsection
  8 20 1, paragraph "e", regarding the teacher leadership supplement
  8 21 foundation aid.  Currently, the district of residence must pay
  8 22 to the receiving district the teacher leadership supplement
  8 23 state cost per pupil for the previous fiscal year whether
  8 24 or not both districts are receiving the teacher leadership
  8 25 supplement state cost per pupil.
  8 26    Currently, a district of residence must make quarterly
  8 27 payments to the receiving district.  Under the bill, the
  8 28 receiving district must bill the district of residence
  8 29 biannually, and the district of residence must make payments
  8 30 in a timely manner.
  8 31    STATEWIDE PROGRESS REPORTS.  Currently, the department of
  8 32 education must make an annual report to the general assembly
  8 33 on statewide progress in student achievement on mathematics
  8 34 and reading at the fourth and eighth grades, on the evaluator
  8 35 training program, and on changes and improvements in teacher
  9  1 evaluations.  The bill eliminates that reporting requirement.
  9  2    STUDENT ACHIEVEMENT AND TEACHER QUALITY PROGRAM.  Currently,
  9  3 in developing administrative rules for consideration by the
  9  4 state board of education, the department must consult with
  9  5 persons representing teachers, administrators, school boards,
  9  6 approved practitioner preparation institutions, and other
  9  7 appropriate education stakeholders.  The bill provides that the
  9  8 department must consult stakeholders when those stakeholders
  9  9 might reasonably be affected by the proposed rule.
  9 10    TERMINOLOGY CHANGES.  Code sections 282.8 and 282.24 are
  9 11 amended to replace references to "elementary and high school"
  9 12 with the term "elementary and secondary school". Definitions
  9 13 for junior high school and high school are also stricken from
  9 14 Code section 282.24.
  9 15    REPEALS.  The bill repeals the following:
  9 16    1.  PILOT PROJECTS TO IMPROVE INSTRUCTIONAL PROGRAMS.  When
  9 17 first enacted in 1987, the provision was part of a program
  9 18 to offer incentives to school districts that established
  9 19 pilot projects to utilize a modified block schedule for
  9 20 offering classes in the districts and sharing the certificated
  9 21 instructional personnel.  Implementation by the department
  9 22 of education is dependent on whether the general assembly
  9 23 appropriates funding for the pilot projects.
  9 24    2.  TEACHER EXCHANGE PROGRAM.  The teacher exchange program
  9 25 was enacted in 1991, contingent on an appropriation of moneys
  9 26 by the general assembly, to permit school districts to exchange
  9 27 licensed instructional personnel with other districts in order
  9 28 to promote the exchange and enhancement of instructional
  9 29 methods and materials and encourage the educational development
  9 30 of Iowa's teachers.  The bill eliminates the provisions
  9 31 relating to the teacher exchange program, including provisions
  9 32 directing the state board to adopt rules to administer the
  9 33 program, directing the director of the department of education
  9 34 to administer the program, establishing the program, and
  9 35 providing for participation in the program by school districts

  7 35 supplement state cost per pupil, unless all of the districts
  8  1 subject to the agreement are receiving such funding; and the
  8  2 teacher leadership supplemental aid payments, unless all
  8  3 districts subject to the agreement are receiving such funding.
  8  4 Because the funding for the teacher leadership supplemental aid
  8  5 payments is scheduled to end with the 2016=2017 fiscal year,
  8  6 the bill repeals the relevant provision June 30, 2018.
  8  7    The bill also changes, from the third Friday of February to

  8 12 requirements for open enrollment payments, the bill provides
  8 13 that the board of directors of the district of residence
  8 14 must pay to the receiving district the teacher leadership

  8 22 to the receiving district the teacher leadership supplement
  8 23 state cost per pupil for the previous fiscal year whether
  8 24 or not both districts are receiving the teacher leadership
  8 25 supplement state cost per pupil.
  8 26    Currently, a district of residence must make quarterly
  8 27 payments to the receiving district.  Under the bill, the
  8 28 receiving district must bill the district of residence
  8 29 biannually, and the district of residence must make payments
  8 30 in a timely manner.
  8 31    STATEWIDE PROGRESS REPORTS.  Currently, the department of
  8 32 education must make an annual report to the general assembly
  8 33 on statewide progress in student achievement on mathematics

  8 23 state cost per pupil for the previous fiscal year whether
  8 24 or not both districts are receiving the teacher leadership
  8 25 supplement state cost per pupil.
  8 26    Currently, a district of residence must make quarterly
  8 27 payments to the receiving district.  Under the bill, the
  8 28 receiving district must bill the district of residence
  8 29 biannually, and the district of residence must make payments
  8 30 in a timely manner.
  8 31    STATEWIDE PROGRESS REPORTS.  Currently, the department of
  8 32 education must make an annual report to the general assembly
  8 33 on statewide progress in student achievement on mathematics
  8 34 and reading at the fourth and eighth grades, on the evaluator
  8 35 training program, and on changes and improvements in teacher
  9  1 evaluations.  The bill eliminates that reporting requirement.
  9  2    STUDENT ACHIEVEMENT AND TEACHER QUALITY PROGRAM.  Currently,
  9  3 in developing administrative rules for consideration by the
  9  4 state board of education, the department must consult with
  9  5 persons representing teachers, administrators, school boards,
  9  6 approved practitioner preparation institutions, and other
  9  7 appropriate education stakeholders.  The bill provides that the
  9  8 department must consult stakeholders when those stakeholders
  9  9 might reasonably be affected by the proposed rule.
  9 10    TERMINOLOGY CHANGES.  Code sections 282.8 and 282.24 are
  9 11 amended to replace references to "elementary and high school"
  9 12 with the term "elementary and secondary school". Definitions
  9 13 for junior high school and high school are also stricken from
  9 14 Code section 282.24.
  9 15    REPEALS.  The bill repeals the following:
  9 16    1.  PILOT PROJECTS TO IMPROVE INSTRUCTIONAL PROGRAMS.  When
  9 17 first enacted in 1987, the provision was part of a program
  9 18 to offer incentives to school districts that established
  9 19 pilot projects to utilize a modified block schedule for
  9 20 offering classes in the districts and sharing the certificated
  9 21 instructional personnel.  Implementation by the department
  9 22 of education is dependent on whether the general assembly
  9 23 appropriates funding for the pilot projects.
  9 24    2.  TEACHER EXCHANGE PROGRAM.  The teacher exchange program
  9 25 was enacted in 1991, contingent on an appropriation of moneys
  9 26 by the general assembly, to permit school districts to exchange
  9 27 licensed instructional personnel with other districts in order
  9 28 to promote the exchange and enhancement of instructional
  9 29 methods and materials and encourage the educational development
  9 30 of Iowa's teachers.  The bill eliminates the provisions
  9 31 relating to the teacher exchange program, including provisions
  9 32 directing the state board to adopt rules to administer the
  9 33 program, directing the director of the department of education
  9 34 to administer the program, establishing the program, and
  9 35 providing for participation in the program by school districts
 10  1 and teachers.

  7 15 tuition limitations of Code section 282.1 shall not apply,
  7 16 and a student attending school in the other state shall not
  7 17 be treated as a pupil of the district of residence in Iowa
  7 18 for purposes of tuition payments to the receiving district
  7 19 or for purposes of the school aid formula.  The bill further
  7 20 establishes that an agreement reached under Code section 282.8
  7 21 does not qualify as a whole grade sharing agreement and the
  7 22 open enrollment provisions do not apply to such an agreement.
  7 23    WHOLE GRADE SHARING AGREEMENTS.  Whole grade sharing
  7 24 is a procedure used by school districts in which all or a
  7 25 substantial portion of the pupils in any grade in two or
  7 26 more school districts share an educational program for all
  7 27 or a substantial portion of a school day under a written
  7 28 agreement.  Currently, the boards of the school districts
  7 29 participating in the agreement must negotiate, as part of
  7 30 the new or existing agreement, the disposition of funding
  7 31 provided under Code chapter 284, the student achievement and
  7 32 teacher quality program.  The bill provides exemptions from
  7 33 the disposition negotiation requirement relating to beginning
  7 34 teacher mentoring and induction funds; the teacher leadership
  7 35 supplement state cost per pupil, unless all of the districts
  8  1 subject to the agreement are receiving such funding; and the
  8  2 teacher leadership supplemental aid payments, unless all
  8  3 districts subject to the agreement are receiving such funding.
  8  4 Because the funding for the teacher leadership supplemental aid
  8  5 payments is scheduled to end with the 2016=2017 fiscal year,
  8  6 the bill repeals the relevant provision June 30, 2018.
  8  7    The bill also changes, from the third Friday of February to
  8  8 the second Friday of January of each year, the second of two
  8  9 dates used to determine the number of pupils participating in a
  8 10 whole grade sharing agreement.
  8 11    OPEN ENROLLMENT PAYMENTS.  In addition to other statutory
  8 12 requirements for open enrollment payments, the bill provides
  8 13 that the board of directors of the district of residence
  8 14 must pay to the receiving district the teacher leadership
  8 15 supplement state cost per pupil for the previous fiscal year
  8 16 or the teacher leadership supplement foundation aid for the
  8 17 previous fiscal year if both the district of residence and the
  8 18 receiving district are receiving such supplements.  Such a
  8 19 limitation currently exists in Code section 284.13, subsection
  8 20 1, paragraph "e", regarding the teacher leadership supplement
  8 21 foundation aid.  Currently, the district of residence must pay
  8 22 to the receiving district the teacher leadership supplement
  8 23 state cost per pupil for the previous fiscal year whether
  8 24 or not both districts are receiving the teacher leadership
  8 25 supplement state cost per pupil.
  8 26    Currently, a district of residence must make quarterly
  8 27 payments to the receiving district.  Under the bill, the
  8 28 receiving district must bill the district of residence
  8 29 biannually, and the district of residence must make payments
  8 30 in a timely manner.
  8 31    STATEWIDE PROGRESS REPORTS.  Currently, the department of
  8 32 education must make an annual report to the general assembly
  8 33 on statewide progress in student achievement on mathematics
  8 34 and reading at the fourth and eighth grades, on the evaluator
  8 35 training program, and on changes and improvements in teacher
  9  1 evaluations.  The bill eliminates that reporting requirement.
  9  2    STUDENT ACHIEVEMENT AND TEACHER QUALITY PROGRAM.  Currently,
  9  3 in developing administrative rules for consideration by the
  9  4 state board of education, the department must consult with
  9  5 persons representing teachers, administrators, school boards,
  9  6 approved practitioner preparation institutions, and other

  9  9 might reasonably be affected by the proposed rule.

  8  4 Because the funding for the teacher leadership supplemental aid
  8  5 payments is scheduled to end with the 2016=2017 fiscal year,
  8  6 the bill repeals the relevant provision June 30, 2018.

  8 12 requirements for open enrollment payments, the bill provides
  8 13 that the board of directors of the district of residence

  8 26    Currently, a district of residence must make quarterly
  8 27 payments to the receiving district.  Under the bill, the
  8 28 receiving district must bill the district of residence

  7 34 teacher mentoring and induction funds; the teacher leadership
  7 35 supplement state cost per pupil, unless all of the districts
  8  1 subject to the agreement are receiving such funding; and the
  8  2 teacher leadership supplemental aid payments, unless all
  8  3 districts subject to the agreement are receiving such funding.

  8  5 payments is scheduled to end with the 2016=2017 fiscal year,
  8  6 the bill repeals the relevant provision June 30, 2018.
  8  7    The bill also changes, from the third Friday of February to
  8  8 the second Friday of January of each year, the second of two

  8 10 whole grade sharing agreement.
  8 11    OPEN ENROLLMENT PAYMENTS.  In addition to other statutory
  8 12 requirements for open enrollment payments, the bill provides
  8 13 that the board of directors of the district of residence
  8 14 must pay to the receiving district the teacher leadership
  8 15 supplement state cost per pupil for the previous fiscal year
  8 16 or the teacher leadership supplement foundation aid for the
  8 17 previous fiscal year if both the district of residence and the
  8 18 receiving district are receiving such supplements.  Such a
  8 19 limitation currently exists in Code section 284.13, subsection
  8 20 1, paragraph "e", regarding the teacher leadership supplement
  8 21 foundation aid.  Currently, the district of residence must pay
  8 22 to the receiving district the teacher leadership supplement
  8 23 state cost per pupil for the previous fiscal year whether
  8 24 or not both districts are receiving the teacher leadership
  8 25 supplement state cost per pupil.
  8 26    Currently, a district of residence must make quarterly
  8 27 payments to the receiving district.  Under the bill, the
  8 28 receiving district must bill the district of residence
  8 29 biannually, and the district of residence must make payments
  8 30 in a timely manner.
  8 31    STATEWIDE PROGRESS REPORTS.  Currently, the department of
  8 32 education must make an annual report to the general assembly
  8 33 on statewide progress in student achievement on mathematics
  8 34 and reading at the fourth and eighth grades, on the evaluator
  8 35 training program, and on changes and improvements in teacher
  9  1 evaluations.  The bill eliminates that reporting requirement.
  9  2    STUDENT ACHIEVEMENT AND TEACHER QUALITY PROGRAM.  Currently,
  9  3 in developing administrative rules for consideration by the
  9  4 state board of education, the department must consult with
  9  5 persons representing teachers, administrators, school boards,
  9  6 approved practitioner preparation institutions, and other
  9  7 appropriate education stakeholders.  The bill provides that the
  9  8 department must consult stakeholders when those stakeholders
  9  9 might reasonably be affected by the proposed rule.
  9 10    TERMINOLOGY CHANGES.  Code sections 282.8 and 282.24 are

  9 12 with the term "elementary and secondary school". Definitions
  9 13 for junior high school and high school are also stricken from
  9 14 Code section 282.24.
  9 15    REPEALS.  The bill repeals the following:
  9 16    1.  PILOT PROJECTS TO IMPROVE INSTRUCTIONAL PROGRAMS.  When
  9 17 first enacted in 1987, the provision was part of a program
  9 18 to offer incentives to school districts that established
  9 19 pilot projects to utilize a modified block schedule for
  9 20 offering classes in the districts and sharing the certificated
  9 21 instructional personnel.  Implementation by the department
  9 22 of education is dependent on whether the general assembly
  9 23 appropriates funding for the pilot projects.
  9 24    2.  TEACHER EXCHANGE PROGRAM.  The teacher exchange program
  9 25 was enacted in 1991, contingent on an appropriation of moneys
  9 26 by the general assembly, to permit school districts to exchange
  9 27 licensed instructional personnel with other districts in order
  9 28 to promote the exchange and enhancement of instructional
  9 29 methods and materials and encourage the educational development
  9 30 of Iowa's teachers.  The bill eliminates the provisions
  9 31 relating to the teacher exchange program, including provisions
  9 32 directing the state board to adopt rules to administer the
  9 33 program, directing the director of the department of education
  9 34 to administer the program, establishing the program, and
  9 35 providing for participation in the program by school districts
 10  1 and teachers.

  7 21 does not qualify as a whole grade sharing agreement and the
  7 22 open enrollment provisions do not apply to such an agreement.
  7 23    WHOLE GRADE SHARING AGREEMENTS.  Whole grade sharing
  7 24 is a procedure used by school districts in which all or a
  7 25 substantial portion of the pupils in any grade in two or
  7 26 more school districts share an educational program for all
  7 27 or a substantial portion of a school day under a written
  7 28 agreement.  Currently, the boards of the school districts
  7 29 participating in the agreement must negotiate, as part of
  7 30 the new or existing agreement, the disposition of funding
  7 31 provided under Code chapter 284, the student achievement and
  7 32 teacher quality program.  The bill provides exemptions from
  7 33 the disposition negotiation requirement relating to beginning
  7 34 teacher mentoring and induction funds; the teacher leadership
  7 35 supplement state cost per pupil, unless all of the districts
  8  1 subject to the agreement are receiving such funding; and the
  8  2 teacher leadership supplemental aid payments, unless all
  8  3 districts subject to the agreement are receiving such funding.
  8  4 Because the funding for the teacher leadership supplemental aid
  8  5 payments is scheduled to end with the 2016=2017 fiscal year,
  8  6 the bill repeals the relevant provision June 30, 2018.
  8  7    The bill also changes, from the third Friday of February to
  8  8 the second Friday of January of each year, the second of two
  8  9 dates used to determine the number of pupils participating in a
  8 10 whole grade sharing agreement.
  8 11    OPEN ENROLLMENT PAYMENTS.  In addition to other statutory
  8 12 requirements for open enrollment payments, the bill provides
  8 13 that the board of directors of the district of residence
  8 14 must pay to the receiving district the teacher leadership
  8 15 supplement state cost per pupil for the previous fiscal year
  8 16 or the teacher leadership supplement foundation aid for the
  8 17 previous fiscal year if both the district of residence and the
  8 18 receiving district are receiving such supplements.  Such a
  8 19 limitation currently exists in Code section 284.13, subsection
  8 20 1, paragraph "e", regarding the teacher leadership supplement
  8 21 foundation aid.  Currently, the district of residence must pay
  8 22 to the receiving district the teacher leadership supplement
  8 23 state cost per pupil for the previous fiscal year whether
  8 24 or not both districts are receiving the teacher leadership
  8 25 supplement state cost per pupil.
  8 26    Currently, a district of residence must make quarterly
  8 27 payments to the receiving district.  Under the bill, the
  8 28 receiving district must bill the district of residence
  8 29 biannually, and the district of residence must make payments
  8 30 in a timely manner.
  8 31    STATEWIDE PROGRESS REPORTS.  Currently, the department of
  8 32 education must make an annual report to the general assembly
  8 33 on statewide progress in student achievement on mathematics
  8 34 and reading at the fourth and eighth grades, on the evaluator
  8 35 training program, and on changes and improvements in teacher
  9  1 evaluations.  The bill eliminates that reporting requirement.
  9  2    STUDENT ACHIEVEMENT AND TEACHER QUALITY PROGRAM.  Currently,
  9  3 in developing administrative rules for consideration by the
  9  4 state board of education, the department must consult with
  9  5 persons representing teachers, administrators, school boards,
  9  6 approved practitioner preparation institutions, and other
  9  7 appropriate education stakeholders.  The bill provides that the
  9  8 department must consult stakeholders when those stakeholders
  9  9 might reasonably be affected by the proposed rule.
  9 10    TERMINOLOGY CHANGES.  Code sections 282.8 and 282.24 are

  7 30 the new or existing agreement, the disposition of funding
  7 31 provided under Code chapter 284, the student achievement and

  8 11    OPEN ENROLLMENT PAYMENTS.  In addition to other statutory
  8 12 requirements for open enrollment payments, the bill provides
  8 13 that the board of directors of the district of residence
  8 14 must pay to the receiving district the teacher leadership
  8 15 supplement state cost per pupil for the previous fiscal year
  8 16 or the teacher leadership supplement foundation aid for the
  8 17 previous fiscal year if both the district of residence and the
  8 18 receiving district are receiving such supplements.  Such a
  8 19 limitation currently exists in Code section 284.13, subsection
  8 20 1, paragraph "e", regarding the teacher leadership supplement
  8 21 foundation aid.  Currently, the district of residence must pay

  9  2    STUDENT ACHIEVEMENT AND TEACHER QUALITY PROGRAM.  Currently,
  9  3 in developing administrative rules for consideration by the
  9  4 state board of education, the department must consult with
  9  5 persons representing teachers, administrators, school boards,
  9  6 approved practitioner preparation institutions, and other
  9  7 appropriate education stakeholders.  The bill provides that the
  9  8 department must consult stakeholders when those stakeholders

  9 27 licensed instructional personnel with other districts in order
  9 28 to promote the exchange and enhancement of instructional

  9 33 program, directing the director of the department of education
  9 34 to administer the program, establishing the program, and

  8 29 biannually, and the district of residence must make payments
  8 30 in a timely manner.
  8 31    STATEWIDE PROGRESS REPORTS.  Currently, the department of
  8 32 education must make an annual report to the general assembly
  8 33 on statewide progress in student achievement on mathematics
  8 34 and reading at the fourth and eighth grades, on the evaluator
  8 35 training program, and on changes and improvements in teacher
  9  1 evaluations.  The bill eliminates that reporting requirement.
  9  2    STUDENT ACHIEVEMENT AND TEACHER QUALITY PROGRAM.  Currently,
  9  3 in developing administrative rules for consideration by the
  9  4 state board of education, the department must consult with
  9  5 persons representing teachers, administrators, school boards,
  9  6 approved practitioner preparation institutions, and other
  9  7 appropriate education stakeholders.  The bill provides that the
  9  8 department must consult stakeholders when those stakeholders
  9  9 might reasonably be affected by the proposed rule.
  9 10    TERMINOLOGY CHANGES.  Code sections 282.8 and 282.24 are

  9 15    REPEALS.  The bill repeals the following:
  9 16    1.  PILOT PROJECTS TO IMPROVE INSTRUCTIONAL PROGRAMS.  When
  9 17 first enacted in 1987, the provision was part of a program
  9 18 to offer incentives to school districts that established
  9 19 pilot projects to utilize a modified block schedule for
  9 20 offering classes in the districts and sharing the certificated
  9 21 instructional personnel.  Implementation by the department
  9 22 of education is dependent on whether the general assembly
  9 23 appropriates funding for the pilot projects.
  9 24    2.  TEACHER EXCHANGE PROGRAM.  The teacher exchange program
  9 25 was enacted in 1991, contingent on an appropriation of moneys
  9 26 by the general assembly, to permit school districts to exchange
  9 27 licensed instructional personnel with other districts in order
  9 28 to promote the exchange and enhancement of instructional
  9 29 methods and materials and encourage the educational development
  9 30 of Iowa's teachers.  The bill eliminates the provisions
  9 31 relating to the teacher exchange program, including provisions
  9 32 directing the state board to adopt rules to administer the
  9 33 program, directing the director of the department of education
  9 34 to administer the program, establishing the program, and
  9 35 providing for participation in the program by school districts

  7 34 teacher mentoring and induction funds; the teacher leadership
  7 35 supplement state cost per pupil, unless all of the districts
  8  1 subject to the agreement are receiving such funding; and the
  8  2 teacher leadership supplemental aid payments, unless all
  8  3 districts subject to the agreement are receiving such funding.
  8  4 Because the funding for the teacher leadership supplemental aid
  8  5 payments is scheduled to end with the 2016=2017 fiscal year,
  8  6 the bill repeals the relevant provision June 30, 2018.
  8  7    The bill also changes, from the third Friday of February to

  8 15 supplement state cost per pupil for the previous fiscal year
  8 16 or the teacher leadership supplement foundation aid for the
  8 17 previous fiscal year if both the district of residence and the
  8 18 receiving district are receiving such supplements.  Such a
  8 19 limitation currently exists in Code section 284.13, subsection
  8 20 1, paragraph "e", regarding the teacher leadership supplement
  8 21 foundation aid.  Currently, the district of residence must pay
  8 22 to the receiving district the teacher leadership supplement
  8 23 state cost per pupil for the previous fiscal year whether
  8 24 or not both districts are receiving the teacher leadership
  8 25 supplement state cost per pupil.
  8 26    Currently, a district of residence must make quarterly
  8 27 payments to the receiving district.  Under the bill, the
  8 28 receiving district must bill the district of residence
  8 29 biannually, and the district of residence must make payments

  8 11    OPEN ENROLLMENT PAYMENTS.  In addition to other statutory
  8 12 requirements for open enrollment payments, the bill provides
  8 13 that the board of directors of the district of residence
  8 14 must pay to the receiving district the teacher leadership
  8 15 supplement state cost per pupil for the previous fiscal year
  8 16 or the teacher leadership supplement foundation aid for the
  8 17 previous fiscal year if both the district of residence and the
  8 18 receiving district are receiving such supplements.  Such a
  8 19 limitation currently exists in Code section 284.13, subsection
  8 20 1, paragraph "e", regarding the teacher leadership supplement
  8 21 foundation aid.  Currently, the district of residence must pay
  8 22 to the receiving district the teacher leadership supplement
  8 23 state cost per pupil for the previous fiscal year whether
  8 24 or not both districts are receiving the teacher leadership
  8 25 supplement state cost per pupil.
  8 26    Currently, a district of residence must make quarterly
  8 27 payments to the receiving district.  Under the bill, the
  8 28 receiving district must bill the district of residence
  8 29 biannually, and the district of residence must make payments
  8 30 in a timely manner.
  8 31    STATEWIDE PROGRESS REPORTS.  Currently, the department of
  8 32 education must make an annual report to the general assembly
  8 33 on statewide progress in student achievement on mathematics
  8 34 and reading at the fourth and eighth grades, on the evaluator
  8 35 training program, and on changes and improvements in teacher
  9  1 evaluations.  The bill eliminates that reporting requirement.
  9  2    STUDENT ACHIEVEMENT AND TEACHER QUALITY PROGRAM.  Currently,
  9  3 in developing administrative rules for consideration by the
  9  4 state board of education, the department must consult with
  9  5 persons representing teachers, administrators, school boards,
  9  6 approved practitioner preparation institutions, and other
  9  7 appropriate education stakeholders.  The bill provides that the
  9  8 department must consult stakeholders when those stakeholders
  9  9 might reasonably be affected by the proposed rule.
  9 10    TERMINOLOGY CHANGES.  Code sections 282.8 and 282.24 are

  9 12 with the term "elementary and secondary school". Definitions
  9 13 for junior high school and high school are also stricken from
  9 14 Code section 282.24.
  9 15    REPEALS.  The bill repeals the following:
  9 16    1.  PILOT PROJECTS TO IMPROVE INSTRUCTIONAL PROGRAMS.  When
  9 17 first enacted in 1987, the provision was part of a program
  9 18 to offer incentives to school districts that established
  9 19 pilot projects to utilize a modified block schedule for
  9 20 offering classes in the districts and sharing the certificated
  9 21 instructional personnel.  Implementation by the department
  9 22 of education is dependent on whether the general assembly
  9 23 appropriates funding for the pilot projects.
  9 24    2.  TEACHER EXCHANGE PROGRAM.  The teacher exchange program
  9 25 was enacted in 1991, contingent on an appropriation of moneys
  9 26 by the general assembly, to permit school districts to exchange
  9 27 licensed instructional personnel with other districts in order
  9 28 to promote the exchange and enhancement of instructional
  9 29 methods and materials and encourage the educational development
  9 30 of Iowa's teachers.  The bill eliminates the provisions
  9 31 relating to the teacher exchange program, including provisions
  9 32 directing the state board to adopt rules to administer the
  9 33 program, directing the director of the department of education
  9 34 to administer the program, establishing the program, and
