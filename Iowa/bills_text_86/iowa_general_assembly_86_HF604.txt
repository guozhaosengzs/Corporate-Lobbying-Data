  7 19 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  7 20 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  7 21    This bill relates to the individual income tax by creating
  7 22 an alternative base income tax imposed at the election of the
  7 23 taxpayer.
  7 24    Division I relates to the computation and imposition of an
  7 25 alternative base income tax.
  7 26    In lieu of the regular personal net income tax computed and
  7 27 imposed under Code section 422.5, a resident or nonresident
  7 28 individual may elect to be subject to an alternative base
  7 29 income tax as provided in the division.  An election must be
  7 30 made not later than the due date for filing the return for
  7 31 a taxable year, including extensions, and under rules to be
  7 32 prescribed by the director.
  7 33    The state income tax of a taxpayer making an election
  7 34 shall be an amount of tax equal to the taxpayer's base income
  7 35 times 5 percent.  "Base income" is defined as the taxpayer's
  8  1 adjusted gross income before the net operating loss deduction
  8  2 as properly computed for federal income tax purposes, less a
  8  3 standard deduction of $6,235 for a married person who files
  8  4 separately or a single person or $12,470 for a married couple
  8  5 filing a joint return, a surviving spouse, or a head of
  8  6 household, less interest and dividends from federal securities,
  8  7 and less social security benefits and retirement income. The
  8  8 division indexes the standard deduction amounts for future
  8  9 inflation. A taxpayer shall not be allowed any nonrefundable
  8 10 or refundable tax credit for the tax year for which the
  8 11 election is made, except the credits for withheld tax and
  8 12 estimated tax paid under Code section 422.16.
  8 13    Taxpayers who are 65 years of age or older who elect the
  8 14 alternative base income tax are not required to file an
  8 15 income tax return if base income does not exceed $32,000 for
  8 16 a married person filing jointly or filing separately on a
  8 17 combined return, a head of household, or a surviving spouse,
  8 18 or $24,000 for all other persons.  For purposes of calculating
  8 19 base income for the filing threshold, taxpayers are required
  8 20 to add back any social security benefits or retirement income
  8 21 otherwise exempt under the bill except for military retirement
  8 22 pay.  Taxpayers who meet these requirements and who do not file
  8 23 a tax return are deemed to have elected to be subject to the
  8 24 alternative base income tax.
  8 25    If a taxpayer making an election is also subject to a local
  8 26 income surtax, that taxpayer is subject to a local income
  8 27 surtax rate that is 22 percent higher than the rate otherwise
  8 28 imposed by the school district or political subdivision.
  8 29    Division II relates to miscellaneous conforming changes.
  8 30    The division makes conforming changes to the definitions of
  8 31 "state income tax liability" for purposes of the Iowa election

  8 33 "state individual income tax" for purposes of the emergency

  9  3 income surtax in Code section 298.2, to include income tax
  9  4 computed and imposed under the alternative system in new Code

  9  6 and 422.21 to include references to new Code section 422.5A
  9  7 in provisions of those Code sections that reference the tax
  9  8 imposed under Code section 422.5.
  9  9    Division III relates to implementation of the bill.

  7 33    The state income tax of a taxpayer making an election

  8  5 filing a joint return, a surviving spouse, or a head of
