  1 15 and surrendered the agricultural assets transfer tax credit

 11 21                           EXPLANATION
 11 22 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
 11 23 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
 11 24    GENERAL.  This bill provides that a taxpayer who
 11 25 participates in the beginning farmer tax credit program
 11 26 (program) may transfer any unexpended and nondepleted
 11 27 portion of a tax credit to a qualified beginning farmer who
 11 28 participates in the program.  The program is administered by
 11 29 the agricultural development division created within the Iowa
 11 30 finance authority (authority).  The purpose of the program
 11 31 is to assist a qualified beginning farmer to acquire or use
 11 32 agricultural assets (e.g., agricultural land or improvements)
 11 33 from a taxpayer (owner).  The qualified beginning farmer and
 11 34 owner must be parties to either a lease or rental agreement
 11 35 in which the beginning farmer pays an amount to the owner or
 12  1 a custom farming contract in which the owner pays an amount
 12  2 to the beginning farmer.  The tax credit equals a percentage
 12  3 of that payment and allows the owner to carry forward the
 12  4 tax credit amount for 10 years.  Currently, the tax credit
 12  5 cannot be transferred except to the owner's estate or trust
 12  6 upon death.  The bill places a number of restrictions upon a
 12  7 transfer to a qualified beginning farmer, including procedures
 12  8 for being issued a replacement tax credit certificate to the
 12  9 qualified beginning farmer.
 12 10    APPLICABILITY TO DIFFERENT VERSIONS OF THE TAX CREDITS.
 12 11  Under the bill, a taxpayer may transfer the agricultural
 12 12 assets transfer tax credit first claimed under any of the
 12 13 following: (1) former Code section 175.37 for a tax year
 12 14 commencing in calendar years 2008 through 2012, (2) current
 12 15 Code section 16.80 for a tax year commencing in calendar years
 12 16 2015 through 2017, and (3) future Code section 16.80 for a
 12 17 tax year commencing in calendar year 2018 and subsequent tax
 12 18 years.  A taxpayer may transfer the custom farming contract tax
 12 19 credit first claimed under any of the following: (1) former
 12 20 Code section 175.38 for a tax year commencing in calendar years
 12 21 2013 and 2014 and (2) current Code section 16.81 for a tax year
 12 22 commencing in calendar years 2015 through 2017.
 12 23    BACKGROUND.  Nine years ago, the general assembly enacted
 12 24 2006 Iowa Acts, chapter 1161, creating the agricultural
 12 25 assets transfer tax credit administered by the agricultural
 12 26 development authority.  Two years ago, the general assembly
 12 27 enacted 2013 Iowa Acts, chapter 125, expanding the program,
 12 28 including by adding the custom farming contract tax credit in
 12 29 former Code section 175.38.  However, the legislation provided
 12 30 that the program was to be eliminated on December 31, 2017,
 12 31 and the former version of the agricultural assets transfer
 12 32 tax credit was to be restored. That same year, the general
 12 33 assembly enacted 2013 Iowa Acts, chapter 100, providing that
 12 34 the agricultural development authority was a division of the
 12 35 Iowa finance authority.  Last year, the general assembly
 13  1 enacted 2014 Iowa Acts, chapter 1080, which repealed Code
 13  2 chapter 175 and enacted a number of its provisions as part
 13  3 of reorganized Code chapter 16, including the program (Code
 13  4 chapter 16, subchapter VIII, part 5, subpart B).  The program,
 13  5 including the tax credits, is still scheduled to be eliminated
 13  6 on December 31, 2017, and at that time the former agricultural
 13  7 assets transfer tax credit will be restored.  Last year, the
 13  8 general assembly also enacted 2014 Iowa Acts, chapter 1112,
 13  9 extending from five to 10 years the period that a taxpayer
 13 10 claiming a past, current, or future version of the tax credit
 13 11 may carry it forward.

 10 14 for a substitute tax credit certificate in the manner and form
 10 15 prescribed by the department.
 10 16    (b)  Subparagraph division (a) does not apply if the
 10 17 department provides for the transfer of the tax credit by
 10 18 another method, including by recording the transfer information
 10 19 on the original tax certificate.
 10 20    (2)  (a)  Within ninety days of the transfer, the qualified
 10 21 beginning farmer shall submit the transferred tax credit
 10 22 certificate, or the transferred substitute tax credit
 10 23 certificate as provided in subparagraph (1), to the department
 10 24 of revenue along with a statement containing the qualified
 10 25 beginning farmer's name, tax identification number, and
 10 26 address, the denomination that each replacement tax credit
 10 27 certificate is to carry, and any other information required by
 10 28 the department.
 10 29    (b)  Within thirty days of receiving the transferred tax
 10 30 credit certificate and the qualified beginning farmer's
 10 31 statement as provided in subparagraph division (a), the
 10 32 department of revenue shall issue one or more replacement tax
 10 33 credit certificates to the qualified beginning farmer. Each
 10 34 replacement tax credit certificate shall contain the same type
 10 35 of information required for the original tax credit certificate
 11  1 and shall have the same expiration date that appeared on the
 11  2 transferred tax credit certificate.
 11  3    (3)  A tax credit shall not be claimed by a qualified
 11  4 beginning farmer until a replacement tax credit certificate
 11  5 identifying the qualified beginning farmer as the proper
 11  6 holder has been issued. The qualified beginning farmer may
 11  7 use the amount of the tax credit transferred against the taxes
 11  8 imposed in chapter 422, divisions II and III, for any future
 11  9 tax year the taxpayer could have claimed the tax credit. Any
 11 10 consideration received for the transfer of the tax credit shall
 11 11 not be included as income under chapter 422, divisions II and
 11 12 III.  Any consideration paid for the transfer of the tax credit
 11 13 shall not be deducted from income under chapter 422, divisions
 11 14 II and III.

 11 16 Act, being deemed of immediate importance, takes effect January
 11 17 1, 2018.

 10  9    (1)  (a)  A taxpayer who has already claimed the tax credit
 10 10 and surrendered the agricultural assets transfer tax credit
 10 11 certificate to the department of revenue, but who is intending

 11 21                           EXPLANATION
 11 22 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
 11 23 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
 11 24    GENERAL.  This bill provides that a taxpayer who
 11 25 participates in the beginning farmer tax credit program
 11 26 (program) may transfer any unexpended and nondepleted
 11 27 portion of a tax credit to a qualified beginning farmer who
 11 28 participates in the program.  The program is administered by
 11 29 the agricultural development division created within the Iowa
 11 30 finance authority (authority).  The purpose of the program
 11 31 is to assist a qualified beginning farmer to acquire or use
 11 32 agricultural assets (e.g., agricultural land or improvements)
 11 33 from a taxpayer (owner).  The qualified beginning farmer and
 11 34 owner must be parties to either a lease or rental agreement
 11 35 in which the beginning farmer pays an amount to the owner or
 12  1 a custom farming contract in which the owner pays an amount
 12  2 to the beginning farmer.  The tax credit equals a percentage
 12  3 of that payment and allows the owner to carry forward the
 12  4 tax credit amount for 10 years.  Currently, the tax credit
 12  5 cannot be transferred except to the owner's estate or trust
 12  6 upon death.  The bill places a number of restrictions upon a
 12  7 transfer to a qualified beginning farmer, including procedures
 12  8 for being issued a replacement tax credit certificate to the
 12  9 qualified beginning farmer.
 12 10    APPLICABILITY TO DIFFERENT VERSIONS OF THE TAX CREDITS.
 12 11  Under the bill, a taxpayer may transfer the agricultural
 12 12 assets transfer tax credit first claimed under any of the
 12 13 following: (1) former Code section 175.37 for a tax year
 12 14 commencing in calendar years 2008 through 2012, (2) current
 12 15 Code section 16.80 for a tax year commencing in calendar years
 12 16 2015 through 2017, and (3) future Code section 16.80 for a
 12 17 tax year commencing in calendar year 2018 and subsequent tax
 12 18 years.  A taxpayer may transfer the custom farming contract tax
 12 19 credit first claimed under any of the following: (1) former
 12 20 Code section 175.38 for a tax year commencing in calendar years
 12 21 2013 and 2014 and (2) current Code section 16.81 for a tax year
 12 22 commencing in calendar years 2015 through 2017.
 12 23    BACKGROUND.  Nine years ago, the general assembly enacted
 12 24 2006 Iowa Acts, chapter 1161, creating the agricultural
 12 25 assets transfer tax credit administered by the agricultural
 12 26 development authority.  Two years ago, the general assembly
 12 27 enacted 2013 Iowa Acts, chapter 125, expanding the program,
 12 28 including by adding the custom farming contract tax credit in
 12 29 former Code section 175.38.  However, the legislation provided
 12 30 that the program was to be eliminated on December 31, 2017,
 12 31 and the former version of the agricultural assets transfer
 12 32 tax credit was to be restored. That same year, the general
 12 33 assembly enacted 2013 Iowa Acts, chapter 100, providing that
 12 34 the agricultural development authority was a division of the
 12 35 Iowa finance authority.  Last year, the general assembly
 13  1 enacted 2014 Iowa Acts, chapter 1080, which repealed Code
 13  2 chapter 175 and enacted a number of its provisions as part
 13  3 of reorganized Code chapter 16, including the program (Code
 13  4 chapter 16, subchapter VIII, part 5, subpart B).  The program,
 13  5 including the tax credits, is still scheduled to be eliminated
 13  6 on December 31, 2017, and at that time the former agricultural
 13  7 assets transfer tax credit will be restored.  Last year, the
 13  8 general assembly also enacted 2014 Iowa Acts, chapter 1112,
 13  9 extending from five to 10 years the period that a taxpayer
 13 10 claiming a past, current, or future version of the tax credit
 13 11 may carry it forward.

 10  7 shall equal the tax credit that would otherwise remain eligible
 10  8 to be credited to the future liability of the taxpayer.
 10  9    (1)  (a)  A taxpayer who has already claimed the tax credit
 10 10 and surrendered the agricultural assets transfer tax credit
 10 11 certificate to the department of revenue, but who is intending
 10 12 to transfer the remaining carryforward tax credit amount to
 10 13 a qualified beginning farmer, shall apply to the department
 10 14 for a substitute tax credit certificate in the manner and form
 10 15 prescribed by the department.
 10 16    (b)  Subparagraph division (a) does not apply if the
 10 17 department provides for the transfer of the tax credit by
 10 18 another method, including by recording the transfer information
 10 19 on the original tax certificate.
 10 20    (2)  (a)  Within ninety days of the transfer, the qualified
 10 21 beginning farmer shall submit the transferred tax credit
 10 22 certificate, or the transferred substitute tax credit
 10 23 certificate as provided in subparagraph (1), to the department
 10 24 of revenue along with a statement containing the qualified
 10 25 beginning farmer's name, tax identification number, and
 10 26 address, the denomination that each replacement tax credit
 10 27 certificate is to carry, and any other information required by
 10 28 the department.
 10 29    (b)  Within thirty days of receiving the transferred tax
 10 30 credit certificate and the qualified beginning farmer's
 10 31 statement as provided in subparagraph division (a), the
 10 32 department of revenue shall issue one or more replacement tax
 10 33 credit certificates to the qualified beginning farmer. Each
 10 34 replacement tax credit certificate shall contain the same type
 10 35 of information required for the original tax credit certificate
 11  1 and shall have the same expiration date that appeared on the
 11  2 transferred tax credit certificate.
 11  3    (3)  A tax credit shall not be claimed by a qualified
 11  4 beginning farmer until a replacement tax credit certificate
 11  5 identifying the qualified beginning farmer as the proper
 11  6 holder has been issued. The qualified beginning farmer may
 11  7 use the amount of the tax credit transferred against the taxes
 11  8 imposed in chapter 422, divisions II and III, for any future
 11  9 tax year the taxpayer could have claimed the tax credit. Any
 11 10 consideration received for the transfer of the tax credit shall
 11 11 not be included as income under chapter 422, divisions II and
 11 12 III.  Any consideration paid for the transfer of the tax credit
 11 13 shall not be deducted from income under chapter 422, divisions
 11 14 II and III.

 12  5 cannot be transferred except to the owner's estate or trust
 12  6 upon death.  The bill places a number of restrictions upon a
 12  7 transfer to a qualified beginning farmer, including procedures
 12  8 for being issued a replacement tax credit certificate to the
 12  9 qualified beginning farmer.
 12 10    APPLICABILITY TO DIFFERENT VERSIONS OF THE TAX CREDITS.
 12 11  Under the bill, a taxpayer may transfer the agricultural
 12 12 assets transfer tax credit first claimed under any of the
 12 13 following: (1) former Code section 175.37 for a tax year
 12 14 commencing in calendar years 2008 through 2012, (2) current
 12 15 Code section 16.80 for a tax year commencing in calendar years
 12 16 2015 through 2017, and (3) future Code section 16.80 for a
 12 17 tax year commencing in calendar year 2018 and subsequent tax
 12 18 years.  A taxpayer may transfer the custom farming contract tax
 12 19 credit first claimed under any of the following: (1) former
 12 20 Code section 175.38 for a tax year commencing in calendar years
 12 21 2013 and 2014 and (2) current Code section 16.81 for a tax year
 12 22 commencing in calendar years 2015 through 2017.
 12 23    BACKGROUND.  Nine years ago, the general assembly enacted
 12 24 2006 Iowa Acts, chapter 1161, creating the agricultural
 12 25 assets transfer tax credit administered by the agricultural
 12 26 development authority.  Two years ago, the general assembly
 12 27 enacted 2013 Iowa Acts, chapter 125, expanding the program,
 12 28 including by adding the custom farming contract tax credit in
 12 29 former Code section 175.38.  However, the legislation provided
 12 30 that the program was to be eliminated on December 31, 2017,
 12 31 and the former version of the agricultural assets transfer
 12 32 tax credit was to be restored. That same year, the general
 12 33 assembly enacted 2013 Iowa Acts, chapter 100, providing that
 12 34 the agricultural development authority was a division of the
 12 35 Iowa finance authority.  Last year, the general assembly
 13  1 enacted 2014 Iowa Acts, chapter 1080, which repealed Code
 13  2 chapter 175 and enacted a number of its provisions as part
 13  3 of reorganized Code chapter 16, including the program (Code
 13  4 chapter 16, subchapter VIII, part 5, subpart B).  The program,
 13  5 including the tax credits, is still scheduled to be eliminated
 13  6 on December 31, 2017, and at that time the former agricultural
 13  7 assets transfer tax credit will be restored.  Last year, the
 13  8 general assembly also enacted 2014 Iowa Acts, chapter 1112,
 13  9 extending from five to 10 years the period that a taxpayer
 13 10 claiming a past, current, or future version of the tax credit
 13 11 may carry it forward.

 11 22 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
 11 23 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
 11 24    GENERAL.  This bill provides that a taxpayer who
 11 25 participates in the beginning farmer tax credit program
 11 26 (program) may transfer any unexpended and nondepleted
 11 27 portion of a tax credit to a qualified beginning farmer who
 11 28 participates in the program.  The program is administered by
 11 29 the agricultural development division created within the Iowa
 11 30 finance authority (authority).  The purpose of the program
 11 31 is to assist a qualified beginning farmer to acquire or use
 11 32 agricultural assets (e.g., agricultural land or improvements)
 11 33 from a taxpayer (owner).  The qualified beginning farmer and
 11 34 owner must be parties to either a lease or rental agreement
 11 35 in which the beginning farmer pays an amount to the owner or
 12  1 a custom farming contract in which the owner pays an amount
 12  2 to the beginning farmer.  The tax credit equals a percentage
 12  3 of that payment and allows the owner to carry forward the
 12  4 tax credit amount for 10 years.  Currently, the tax credit
 12  5 cannot be transferred except to the owner's estate or trust
 12  6 upon death.  The bill places a number of restrictions upon a
 12  7 transfer to a qualified beginning farmer, including procedures
 12  8 for being issued a replacement tax credit certificate to the

 12 17 tax year commencing in calendar year 2018 and subsequent tax
 12 18 years.  A taxpayer may transfer the custom farming contract tax
 12 19 credit first claimed under any of the following: (1) former
 12 20 Code section 175.38 for a tax year commencing in calendar years
 12 21 2013 and 2014 and (2) current Code section 16.81 for a tax year

 11 22 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
 11 23 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
 11 24    GENERAL.  This bill provides that a taxpayer who
 11 25 participates in the beginning farmer tax credit program
 11 26 (program) may transfer any unexpended and nondepleted
 11 27 portion of a tax credit to a qualified beginning farmer who
 11 28 participates in the program.  The program is administered by
 11 29 the agricultural development division created within the Iowa
 11 30 finance authority (authority).  The purpose of the program
 11 31 is to assist a qualified beginning farmer to acquire or use
 11 32 agricultural assets (e.g., agricultural land or improvements)
 11 33 from a taxpayer (owner).  The qualified beginning farmer and
 11 34 owner must be parties to either a lease or rental agreement
 11 35 in which the beginning farmer pays an amount to the owner or
 12  1 a custom farming contract in which the owner pays an amount
 12  2 to the beginning farmer.  The tax credit equals a percentage
 12  3 of that payment and allows the owner to carry forward the
 12  4 tax credit amount for 10 years.  Currently, the tax credit
 12  5 cannot be transferred except to the owner's estate or trust
 12  6 upon death.  The bill places a number of restrictions upon a
 12  7 transfer to a qualified beginning farmer, including procedures
 12  8 for being issued a replacement tax credit certificate to the
 12  9 qualified beginning farmer.
 12 10    APPLICABILITY TO DIFFERENT VERSIONS OF THE TAX CREDITS.
 12 11  Under the bill, a taxpayer may transfer the agricultural
 12 12 assets transfer tax credit first claimed under any of the
 12 13 following: (1) former Code section 175.37 for a tax year
 12 14 commencing in calendar years 2008 through 2012, (2) current
 12 15 Code section 16.80 for a tax year commencing in calendar years
 12 16 2015 through 2017, and (3) future Code section 16.80 for a
 12 17 tax year commencing in calendar year 2018 and subsequent tax
 12 18 years.  A taxpayer may transfer the custom farming contract tax
 12 19 credit first claimed under any of the following: (1) former
 12 20 Code section 175.38 for a tax year commencing in calendar years
 12 21 2013 and 2014 and (2) current Code section 16.81 for a tax year
 12 22 commencing in calendar years 2015 through 2017.
 12 23    BACKGROUND.  Nine years ago, the general assembly enacted
 12 24 2006 Iowa Acts, chapter 1161, creating the agricultural
 12 25 assets transfer tax credit administered by the agricultural
 12 26 development authority.  Two years ago, the general assembly
 12 27 enacted 2013 Iowa Acts, chapter 125, expanding the program,
 12 28 including by adding the custom farming contract tax credit in
 12 29 former Code section 175.38.  However, the legislation provided
 12 30 that the program was to be eliminated on December 31, 2017,
 12 31 and the former version of the agricultural assets transfer
 12 32 tax credit was to be restored. That same year, the general
 12 33 assembly enacted 2013 Iowa Acts, chapter 100, providing that
 12 34 the agricultural development authority was a division of the
 12 35 Iowa finance authority.  Last year, the general assembly
 13  1 enacted 2014 Iowa Acts, chapter 1080, which repealed Code
 13  2 chapter 175 and enacted a number of its provisions as part
 13  3 of reorganized Code chapter 16, including the program (Code
 13  4 chapter 16, subchapter VIII, part 5, subpart B).  The program,
 13  5 including the tax credits, is still scheduled to be eliminated
 13  6 on December 31, 2017, and at that time the former agricultural
 13  7 assets transfer tax credit will be restored.  Last year, the
 13  8 general assembly also enacted 2014 Iowa Acts, chapter 1112,
 13  9 extending from five to 10 years the period that a taxpayer
 13 10 claiming a past, current, or future version of the tax credit
 13 11 may carry it forward.

 11  7 use the amount of the tax credit transferred against the taxes
 11  8 imposed in chapter 422, divisions II and III, for any future
 11  9 tax year the taxpayer could have claimed the tax credit. Any
 11 10 consideration received for the transfer of the tax credit shall

 11 22 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
 11 23 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
 11 24    GENERAL.  This bill provides that a taxpayer who
 11 25 participates in the beginning farmer tax credit program
 11 26 (program) may transfer any unexpended and nondepleted
 11 27 portion of a tax credit to a qualified beginning farmer who
 11 28 participates in the program.  The program is administered by
 11 29 the agricultural development division created within the Iowa
 11 30 finance authority (authority).  The purpose of the program
 11 31 is to assist a qualified beginning farmer to acquire or use
 11 32 agricultural assets (e.g., agricultural land or improvements)
 11 33 from a taxpayer (owner).  The qualified beginning farmer and
 11 34 owner must be parties to either a lease or rental agreement
 11 35 in which the beginning farmer pays an amount to the owner or
 12  1 a custom farming contract in which the owner pays an amount
 12  2 to the beginning farmer.  The tax credit equals a percentage
 12  3 of that payment and allows the owner to carry forward the
 12  4 tax credit amount for 10 years.  Currently, the tax credit
 12  5 cannot be transferred except to the owner's estate or trust
 12  6 upon death.  The bill places a number of restrictions upon a
 12  7 transfer to a qualified beginning farmer, including procedures
 12  8 for being issued a replacement tax credit certificate to the
 12  9 qualified beginning farmer.
 12 10    APPLICABILITY TO DIFFERENT VERSIONS OF THE TAX CREDITS.
 12 11  Under the bill, a taxpayer may transfer the agricultural
 12 12 assets transfer tax credit first claimed under any of the
 12 13 following: (1) former Code section 175.37 for a tax year
 12 14 commencing in calendar years 2008 through 2012, (2) current
 12 15 Code section 16.80 for a tax year commencing in calendar years

 12 17 tax year commencing in calendar year 2018 and subsequent tax
 12 18 years.  A taxpayer may transfer the custom farming contract tax
 12 19 credit first claimed under any of the following: (1) former
 12 20 Code section 175.38 for a tax year commencing in calendar years
 12 21 2013 and 2014 and (2) current Code section 16.81 for a tax year
 12 22 commencing in calendar years 2015 through 2017.
 12 23    BACKGROUND.  Nine years ago, the general assembly enacted
 12 24 2006 Iowa Acts, chapter 1161, creating the agricultural
 12 25 assets transfer tax credit administered by the agricultural
 12 26 development authority.  Two years ago, the general assembly
 12 27 enacted 2013 Iowa Acts, chapter 125, expanding the program,
 12 28 including by adding the custom farming contract tax credit in
 12 29 former Code section 175.38.  However, the legislation provided
 12 30 that the program was to be eliminated on December 31, 2017,
 12 31 and the former version of the agricultural assets transfer
 12 32 tax credit was to be restored. That same year, the general
 12 33 assembly enacted 2013 Iowa Acts, chapter 100, providing that
 12 34 the agricultural development authority was a division of the
 12 35 Iowa finance authority.  Last year, the general assembly
 13  1 enacted 2014 Iowa Acts, chapter 1080, which repealed Code
 13  2 chapter 175 and enacted a number of its provisions as part
 13  3 of reorganized Code chapter 16, including the program (Code
 13  4 chapter 16, subchapter VIII, part 5, subpart B).  The program,
 13  5 including the tax credits, is still scheduled to be eliminated
 13  6 on December 31, 2017, and at that time the former agricultural
 13  7 assets transfer tax credit will be restored.  Last year, the
 13  8 general assembly also enacted 2014 Iowa Acts, chapter 1112,
 13  9 extending from five to 10 years the period that a taxpayer
 13 10 claiming a past, current, or future version of the tax credit

 11 22 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
 11 23 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
 11 24    GENERAL.  This bill provides that a taxpayer who
 11 25 participates in the beginning farmer tax credit program
 11 26 (program) may transfer any unexpended and nondepleted
 11 27 portion of a tax credit to a qualified beginning farmer who
 11 28 participates in the program.  The program is administered by
 11 29 the agricultural development division created within the Iowa
 11 30 finance authority (authority).  The purpose of the program
 11 31 is to assist a qualified beginning farmer to acquire or use
 11 32 agricultural assets (e.g., agricultural land or improvements)
 11 33 from a taxpayer (owner).  The qualified beginning farmer and
 11 34 owner must be parties to either a lease or rental agreement
 11 35 in which the beginning farmer pays an amount to the owner or
 12  1 a custom farming contract in which the owner pays an amount
 12  2 to the beginning farmer.  The tax credit equals a percentage
 12  3 of that payment and allows the owner to carry forward the
 12  4 tax credit amount for 10 years.  Currently, the tax credit
 12  5 cannot be transferred except to the owner's estate or trust
 12  6 upon death.  The bill places a number of restrictions upon a
 12  7 transfer to a qualified beginning farmer, including procedures
 12  8 for being issued a replacement tax credit certificate to the
 12  9 qualified beginning farmer.

 12 17 tax year commencing in calendar year 2018 and subsequent tax
 12 18 years.  A taxpayer may transfer the custom farming contract tax
 12 19 credit first claimed under any of the following: (1) former
 12 20 Code section 175.38 for a tax year commencing in calendar years
 12 21 2013 and 2014 and (2) current Code section 16.81 for a tax year

 11 24    GENERAL.  This bill provides that a taxpayer who
 11 25 participates in the beginning farmer tax credit program
 11 26 (program) may transfer any unexpended and nondepleted
 11 27 portion of a tax credit to a qualified beginning farmer who
 11 28 participates in the program.  The program is administered by
 11 29 the agricultural development division created within the Iowa
 11 30 finance authority (authority).  The purpose of the program
 11 31 is to assist a qualified beginning farmer to acquire or use
 11 32 agricultural assets (e.g., agricultural land or improvements)
 11 33 from a taxpayer (owner).  The qualified beginning farmer and
 11 34 owner must be parties to either a lease or rental agreement
 11 35 in which the beginning farmer pays an amount to the owner or
 12  1 a custom farming contract in which the owner pays an amount
 12  2 to the beginning farmer.  The tax credit equals a percentage
 12  3 of that payment and allows the owner to carry forward the
 12  4 tax credit amount for 10 years.  Currently, the tax credit
 12  5 cannot be transferred except to the owner's estate or trust
 12  6 upon death.  The bill places a number of restrictions upon a
 12  7 transfer to a qualified beginning farmer, including procedures
 12  8 for being issued a replacement tax credit certificate to the
 12  9 qualified beginning farmer.

 12 17 tax year commencing in calendar year 2018 and subsequent tax
 12 18 years.  A taxpayer may transfer the custom farming contract tax
 12 19 credit first claimed under any of the following: (1) former
 12 20 Code section 175.38 for a tax year commencing in calendar years
 12 21 2013 and 2014 and (2) current Code section 16.81 for a tax year

 11 21                           EXPLANATION
 11 22 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
 11 23 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
 11 24    GENERAL.  This bill provides that a taxpayer who
 11 25 participates in the beginning farmer tax credit program
 11 26 (program) may transfer any unexpended and nondepleted
 11 27 portion of a tax credit to a qualified beginning farmer who
 11 28 participates in the program.  The program is administered by
 11 29 the agricultural development division created within the Iowa
 11 30 finance authority (authority).  The purpose of the program
 11 31 is to assist a qualified beginning farmer to acquire or use
 11 32 agricultural assets (e.g., agricultural land or improvements)
 11 33 from a taxpayer (owner).  The qualified beginning farmer and
 11 34 owner must be parties to either a lease or rental agreement
 11 35 in which the beginning farmer pays an amount to the owner or
 12  1 a custom farming contract in which the owner pays an amount
 12  2 to the beginning farmer.  The tax credit equals a percentage
 12  3 of that payment and allows the owner to carry forward the
 12  4 tax credit amount for 10 years.  Currently, the tax credit
 12  5 cannot be transferred except to the owner's estate or trust
 12  6 upon death.  The bill places a number of restrictions upon a
 12  7 transfer to a qualified beginning farmer, including procedures
 12  8 for being issued a replacement tax credit certificate to the
 12  9 qualified beginning farmer.
 12 10    APPLICABILITY TO DIFFERENT VERSIONS OF THE TAX CREDITS.
 12 11  Under the bill, a taxpayer may transfer the agricultural
 12 12 assets transfer tax credit first claimed under any of the
 12 13 following: (1) former Code section 175.37 for a tax year
 12 14 commencing in calendar years 2008 through 2012, (2) current
 12 15 Code section 16.80 for a tax year commencing in calendar years
 12 16 2015 through 2017, and (3) future Code section 16.80 for a
 12 17 tax year commencing in calendar year 2018 and subsequent tax
 12 18 years.  A taxpayer may transfer the custom farming contract tax
 12 19 credit first claimed under any of the following: (1) former
 12 20 Code section 175.38 for a tax year commencing in calendar years
 12 21 2013 and 2014 and (2) current Code section 16.81 for a tax year
 12 22 commencing in calendar years 2015 through 2017.
 12 23    BACKGROUND.  Nine years ago, the general assembly enacted
 12 24 2006 Iowa Acts, chapter 1161, creating the agricultural
 12 25 assets transfer tax credit administered by the agricultural
 12 26 development authority.  Two years ago, the general assembly
 12 27 enacted 2013 Iowa Acts, chapter 125, expanding the program,
 12 28 including by adding the custom farming contract tax credit in
 12 29 former Code section 175.38.  However, the legislation provided
 12 30 that the program was to be eliminated on December 31, 2017,
 12 31 and the former version of the agricultural assets transfer
 12 32 tax credit was to be restored. That same year, the general
 12 33 assembly enacted 2013 Iowa Acts, chapter 100, providing that
 12 34 the agricultural development authority was a division of the
 12 35 Iowa finance authority.  Last year, the general assembly
 13  1 enacted 2014 Iowa Acts, chapter 1080, which repealed Code
 13  2 chapter 175 and enacted a number of its provisions as part
 13  3 of reorganized Code chapter 16, including the program (Code
 13  4 chapter 16, subchapter VIII, part 5, subpart B).  The program,
 13  5 including the tax credits, is still scheduled to be eliminated
 13  6 on December 31, 2017, and at that time the former agricultural
 13  7 assets transfer tax credit will be restored.  Last year, the
 13  8 general assembly also enacted 2014 Iowa Acts, chapter 1112,
 13  9 extending from five to 10 years the period that a taxpayer
 13 10 claiming a past, current, or future version of the tax credit
 13 11 may carry it forward.

 12 12 assets transfer tax credit first claimed under any of the
 12 13 following: (1) former Code section 175.37 for a tax year
 12 14 commencing in calendar years 2008 through 2012, (2) current
 12 15 Code section 16.80 for a tax year commencing in calendar years
 12 16 2015 through 2017, and (3) future Code section 16.80 for a
 12 17 tax year commencing in calendar year 2018 and subsequent tax
 12 18 years.  A taxpayer may transfer the custom farming contract tax
 12 19 credit first claimed under any of the following: (1) former
 12 20 Code section 175.38 for a tax year commencing in calendar years
 12 21 2013 and 2014 and (2) current Code section 16.81 for a tax year
 12 22 commencing in calendar years 2015 through 2017.
 12 23    BACKGROUND.  Nine years ago, the general assembly enacted
 12 24 2006 Iowa Acts, chapter 1161, creating the agricultural
 12 25 assets transfer tax credit administered by the agricultural
 12 26 development authority.  Two years ago, the general assembly
 12 27 enacted 2013 Iowa Acts, chapter 125, expanding the program,
 12 28 including by adding the custom farming contract tax credit in
 12 29 former Code section 175.38.  However, the legislation provided
 12 30 that the program was to be eliminated on December 31, 2017,
 12 31 and the former version of the agricultural assets transfer
 12 32 tax credit was to be restored. That same year, the general
 12 33 assembly enacted 2013 Iowa Acts, chapter 100, providing that
 12 34 the agricultural development authority was a division of the
 12 35 Iowa finance authority.  Last year, the general assembly
 13  1 enacted 2014 Iowa Acts, chapter 1080, which repealed Code
 13  2 chapter 175 and enacted a number of its provisions as part
 13  3 of reorganized Code chapter 16, including the program (Code
 13  4 chapter 16, subchapter VIII, part 5, subpart B).  The program,
 13  5 including the tax credits, is still scheduled to be eliminated
 13  6 on December 31, 2017, and at that time the former agricultural
 13  7 assets transfer tax credit will be restored.  Last year, the
 13  8 general assembly also enacted 2014 Iowa Acts, chapter 1112,
 13  9 extending from five to 10 years the period that a taxpayer
 13 10 claiming a past, current, or future version of the tax credit
 13 11 may carry it forward.

 11 22 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
 11 23 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
 11 24    GENERAL.  This bill provides that a taxpayer who
 11 25 participates in the beginning farmer tax credit program
 11 26 (program) may transfer any unexpended and nondepleted
 11 27 portion of a tax credit to a qualified beginning farmer who
 11 28 participates in the program.  The program is administered by
 11 29 the agricultural development division created within the Iowa
 11 30 finance authority (authority).  The purpose of the program
 11 31 is to assist a qualified beginning farmer to acquire or use
 11 32 agricultural assets (e.g., agricultural land or improvements)
 11 33 from a taxpayer (owner).  The qualified beginning farmer and
 11 34 owner must be parties to either a lease or rental agreement
 11 35 in which the beginning farmer pays an amount to the owner or
 12  1 a custom farming contract in which the owner pays an amount
 12  2 to the beginning farmer.  The tax credit equals a percentage
 12  3 of that payment and allows the owner to carry forward the
 12  4 tax credit amount for 10 years.  Currently, the tax credit
 12  5 cannot be transferred except to the owner's estate or trust
 12  6 upon death.  The bill places a number of restrictions upon a
 12  7 transfer to a qualified beginning farmer, including procedures
 12  8 for being issued a replacement tax credit certificate to the
 12  9 qualified beginning farmer.

 11 21                           EXPLANATION
 11 22 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
 11 23 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
 11 24    GENERAL.  This bill provides that a taxpayer who
 11 25 participates in the beginning farmer tax credit program
 11 26 (program) may transfer any unexpended and nondepleted
 11 27 portion of a tax credit to a qualified beginning farmer who
 11 28 participates in the program.  The program is administered by
 11 29 the agricultural development division created within the Iowa
 11 30 finance authority (authority).  The purpose of the program
 11 31 is to assist a qualified beginning farmer to acquire or use
 11 32 agricultural assets (e.g., agricultural land or improvements)
 11 33 from a taxpayer (owner).  The qualified beginning farmer and
 11 34 owner must be parties to either a lease or rental agreement
 11 35 in which the beginning farmer pays an amount to the owner or
 12  1 a custom farming contract in which the owner pays an amount
 12  2 to the beginning farmer.  The tax credit equals a percentage
 12  3 of that payment and allows the owner to carry forward the
 12  4 tax credit amount for 10 years.  Currently, the tax credit
 12  5 cannot be transferred except to the owner's estate or trust
 12  6 upon death.  The bill places a number of restrictions upon a
 12  7 transfer to a qualified beginning farmer, including procedures
 12  8 for being issued a replacement tax credit certificate to the
 12  9 qualified beginning farmer.
 12 10    APPLICABILITY TO DIFFERENT VERSIONS OF THE TAX CREDITS.
 12 11  Under the bill, a taxpayer may transfer the agricultural
 12 12 assets transfer tax credit first claimed under any of the
 12 13 following: (1) former Code section 175.37 for a tax year
 12 14 commencing in calendar years 2008 through 2012, (2) current
 12 15 Code section 16.80 for a tax year commencing in calendar years
 12 16 2015 through 2017, and (3) future Code section 16.80 for a
 12 17 tax year commencing in calendar year 2018 and subsequent tax
 12 18 years.  A taxpayer may transfer the custom farming contract tax
 12 19 credit first claimed under any of the following: (1) former
 12 20 Code section 175.38 for a tax year commencing in calendar years
 12 21 2013 and 2014 and (2) current Code section 16.81 for a tax year
 12 22 commencing in calendar years 2015 through 2017.
 12 23    BACKGROUND.  Nine years ago, the general assembly enacted
 12 24 2006 Iowa Acts, chapter 1161, creating the agricultural
 12 25 assets transfer tax credit administered by the agricultural
 12 26 development authority.  Two years ago, the general assembly
 12 27 enacted 2013 Iowa Acts, chapter 125, expanding the program,
 12 28 including by adding the custom farming contract tax credit in
 12 29 former Code section 175.38.  However, the legislation provided
 12 30 that the program was to be eliminated on December 31, 2017,
 12 31 and the former version of the agricultural assets transfer
 12 32 tax credit was to be restored. That same year, the general
 12 33 assembly enacted 2013 Iowa Acts, chapter 100, providing that
 12 34 the agricultural development authority was a division of the
 12 35 Iowa finance authority.  Last year, the general assembly
 13  1 enacted 2014 Iowa Acts, chapter 1080, which repealed Code
 13  2 chapter 175 and enacted a number of its provisions as part
 13  3 of reorganized Code chapter 16, including the program (Code
 13  4 chapter 16, subchapter VIII, part 5, subpart B).  The program,
 13  5 including the tax credits, is still scheduled to be eliminated
 13  6 on December 31, 2017, and at that time the former agricultural
 13  7 assets transfer tax credit will be restored.  Last year, the
 13  8 general assembly also enacted 2014 Iowa Acts, chapter 1112,
 13  9 extending from five to 10 years the period that a taxpayer
 13 10 claiming a past, current, or future version of the tax credit
 13 11 may carry it forward.

 11 25 participates in the beginning farmer tax credit program
 11 26 (program) may transfer any unexpended and nondepleted
 11 27 portion of a tax credit to a qualified beginning farmer who
 11 28 participates in the program.  The program is administered by
 11 29 the agricultural development division created within the Iowa
 11 30 finance authority (authority).  The purpose of the program
 11 31 is to assist a qualified beginning farmer to acquire or use
 11 32 agricultural assets (e.g., agricultural land or improvements)
 11 33 from a taxpayer (owner).  The qualified beginning farmer and
 11 34 owner must be parties to either a lease or rental agreement
 11 35 in which the beginning farmer pays an amount to the owner or
 12  1 a custom farming contract in which the owner pays an amount
 12  2 to the beginning farmer.  The tax credit equals a percentage
 12  3 of that payment and allows the owner to carry forward the
 12  4 tax credit amount for 10 years.  Currently, the tax credit
 12  5 cannot be transferred except to the owner's estate or trust
 12  6 upon death.  The bill places a number of restrictions upon a
 12  7 transfer to a qualified beginning farmer, including procedures
 12  8 for being issued a replacement tax credit certificate to the
 12  9 qualified beginning farmer.

 12 17 tax year commencing in calendar year 2018 and subsequent tax
 12 18 years.  A taxpayer may transfer the custom farming contract tax
 12 19 credit first claimed under any of the following: (1) former

 11 22 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
 11 23 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
 11 24    GENERAL.  This bill provides that a taxpayer who
 11 25 participates in the beginning farmer tax credit program
 11 26 (program) may transfer any unexpended and nondepleted
 11 27 portion of a tax credit to a qualified beginning farmer who
 11 28 participates in the program.  The program is administered by
 11 29 the agricultural development division created within the Iowa
 11 30 finance authority (authority).  The purpose of the program
 11 31 is to assist a qualified beginning farmer to acquire or use
 11 32 agricultural assets (e.g., agricultural land or improvements)
 11 33 from a taxpayer (owner).  The qualified beginning farmer and
 11 34 owner must be parties to either a lease or rental agreement
 11 35 in which the beginning farmer pays an amount to the owner or
 12  1 a custom farming contract in which the owner pays an amount
 12  2 to the beginning farmer.  The tax credit equals a percentage
 12  3 of that payment and allows the owner to carry forward the
 12  4 tax credit amount for 10 years.  Currently, the tax credit
 12  5 cannot be transferred except to the owner's estate or trust
 12  6 upon death.  The bill places a number of restrictions upon a
 12  7 transfer to a qualified beginning farmer, including procedures
 12  8 for being issued a replacement tax credit certificate to the
 12  9 qualified beginning farmer.
 12 10    APPLICABILITY TO DIFFERENT VERSIONS OF THE TAX CREDITS.
 12 11  Under the bill, a taxpayer may transfer the agricultural
 12 12 assets transfer tax credit first claimed under any of the
 12 13 following: (1) former Code section 175.37 for a tax year
 12 14 commencing in calendar years 2008 through 2012, (2) current
 12 15 Code section 16.80 for a tax year commencing in calendar years

 12 17 tax year commencing in calendar year 2018 and subsequent tax
 12 18 years.  A taxpayer may transfer the custom farming contract tax
 12 19 credit first claimed under any of the following: (1) former
 12 20 Code section 175.38 for a tax year commencing in calendar years
 12 21 2013 and 2014 and (2) current Code section 16.81 for a tax year
 12 22 commencing in calendar years 2015 through 2017.
 12 23    BACKGROUND.  Nine years ago, the general assembly enacted
 12 24 2006 Iowa Acts, chapter 1161, creating the agricultural
 12 25 assets transfer tax credit administered by the agricultural
 12 26 development authority.  Two years ago, the general assembly
 12 27 enacted 2013 Iowa Acts, chapter 125, expanding the program,
 12 28 including by adding the custom farming contract tax credit in
 12 29 former Code section 175.38.  However, the legislation provided
 12 30 that the program was to be eliminated on December 31, 2017,
 12 31 and the former version of the agricultural assets transfer
 12 32 tax credit was to be restored. That same year, the general
 12 33 assembly enacted 2013 Iowa Acts, chapter 100, providing that
 12 34 the agricultural development authority was a division of the

 12 12 assets transfer tax credit first claimed under any of the
 12 13 following: (1) former Code section 175.37 for a tax year
 12 14 commencing in calendar years 2008 through 2012, (2) current
 12 15 Code section 16.80 for a tax year commencing in calendar years
 12 16 2015 through 2017, and (3) future Code section 16.80 for a
 12 17 tax year commencing in calendar year 2018 and subsequent tax
 12 18 years.  A taxpayer may transfer the custom farming contract tax
 12 19 credit first claimed under any of the following: (1) former
 12 20 Code section 175.38 for a tax year commencing in calendar years
 12 21 2013 and 2014 and (2) current Code section 16.81 for a tax year
 12 22 commencing in calendar years 2015 through 2017.
 12 23    BACKGROUND.  Nine years ago, the general assembly enacted
 12 24 2006 Iowa Acts, chapter 1161, creating the agricultural
 12 25 assets transfer tax credit administered by the agricultural
 12 26 development authority.  Two years ago, the general assembly
 12 27 enacted 2013 Iowa Acts, chapter 125, expanding the program,
 12 28 including by adding the custom farming contract tax credit in
 12 29 former Code section 175.38.  However, the legislation provided
 12 30 that the program was to be eliminated on December 31, 2017,
 12 31 and the former version of the agricultural assets transfer
 12 32 tax credit was to be restored. That same year, the general
 12 33 assembly enacted 2013 Iowa Acts, chapter 100, providing that
 12 34 the agricultural development authority was a division of the
 12 35 Iowa finance authority.  Last year, the general assembly
 13  1 enacted 2014 Iowa Acts, chapter 1080, which repealed Code
 13  2 chapter 175 and enacted a number of its provisions as part
 13  3 of reorganized Code chapter 16, including the program (Code
 13  4 chapter 16, subchapter VIII, part 5, subpart B).  The program,
 13  5 including the tax credits, is still scheduled to be eliminated
 13  6 on December 31, 2017, and at that time the former agricultural
 13  7 assets transfer tax credit will be restored.  Last year, the
 13  8 general assembly also enacted 2014 Iowa Acts, chapter 1112,
 13  9 extending from five to 10 years the period that a taxpayer
 13 10 claiming a past, current, or future version of the tax credit
 13 11 may carry it forward.

 11 22 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
 11 23 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
 11 24    GENERAL.  This bill provides that a taxpayer who
 11 25 participates in the beginning farmer tax credit program
 11 26 (program) may transfer any unexpended and nondepleted
 11 27 portion of a tax credit to a qualified beginning farmer who
 11 28 participates in the program.  The program is administered by
 11 29 the agricultural development division created within the Iowa
 11 30 finance authority (authority).  The purpose of the program
 11 31 is to assist a qualified beginning farmer to acquire or use
 11 32 agricultural assets (e.g., agricultural land or improvements)
 11 33 from a taxpayer (owner).  The qualified beginning farmer and
 11 34 owner must be parties to either a lease or rental agreement
 11 35 in which the beginning farmer pays an amount to the owner or
 12  1 a custom farming contract in which the owner pays an amount
 12  2 to the beginning farmer.  The tax credit equals a percentage
 12  3 of that payment and allows the owner to carry forward the
 12  4 tax credit amount for 10 years.  Currently, the tax credit
 12  5 cannot be transferred except to the owner's estate or trust
 12  6 upon death.  The bill places a number of restrictions upon a
 12  7 transfer to a qualified beginning farmer, including procedures
 12  8 for being issued a replacement tax credit certificate to the
 12  9 qualified beginning farmer.

 11 24    GENERAL.  This bill provides that a taxpayer who
 11 25 participates in the beginning farmer tax credit program
 11 26 (program) may transfer any unexpended and nondepleted
 11 27 portion of a tax credit to a qualified beginning farmer who
 11 28 participates in the program.  The program is administered by
 11 29 the agricultural development division created within the Iowa
 11 30 finance authority (authority).  The purpose of the program
 11 31 is to assist a qualified beginning farmer to acquire or use
 11 32 agricultural assets (e.g., agricultural land or improvements)
 11 33 from a taxpayer (owner).  The qualified beginning farmer and
 11 34 owner must be parties to either a lease or rental agreement
 11 35 in which the beginning farmer pays an amount to the owner or
 12  1 a custom farming contract in which the owner pays an amount
 12  2 to the beginning farmer.  The tax credit equals a percentage
 12  3 of that payment and allows the owner to carry forward the
 12  4 tax credit amount for 10 years.  Currently, the tax credit
 12  5 cannot be transferred except to the owner's estate or trust
 12  6 upon death.  The bill places a number of restrictions upon a
 12  7 transfer to a qualified beginning farmer, including procedures
 12  8 for being issued a replacement tax credit certificate to the
 12  9 qualified beginning farmer.
