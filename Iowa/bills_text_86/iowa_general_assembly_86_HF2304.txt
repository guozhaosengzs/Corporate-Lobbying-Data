  7 20 equipment, the postelection audit board shall, within two days,
  7 21 conduct an audit of the offices for which such difference
  7 22 was found in at least two additional precincts.  If the
  7 23 second audit also indicates a difference in the vote totals
  7 24 that is greater than one=half of one percent, but no fewer
  7 25 than two votes, from the results on the printed report from
  7 26 the automatic tabulating equipment, the commissioner shall
  7 27 immediately notify the state commissioner of elections.  The
  7 28 state commissioner may direct the commissioner, or any other
  7 29 commissioner of a county where the office appeared on the
  7 30 ballot, to conduct an additional audit of the office in a
  7 31 number of precincts determined by the state commissioner.
  7 32    The bill provides that if a recount of an office is
  7 33 requested, the postelection audit of that office shall not be
  7 34 conducted or shall be terminated, as the case may be.
  7 35    The bill requires the state commissioner of elections to

  7 22 was found in at least two additional precincts.  If the
  7 23 second audit also indicates a difference in the vote totals
  7 24 that is greater than one=half of one percent, but no fewer
  7 25 than two votes, from the results on the printed report from
  7 26 the automatic tabulating equipment, the commissioner shall
  7 27 immediately notify the state commissioner of elections.  The
  7 28 state commissioner may direct the commissioner, or any other
  7 29 commissioner of a county where the office appeared on the
  7 30 ballot, to conduct an additional audit of the office in a
  7 31 number of precincts determined by the state commissioner.
  7 32    The bill provides that if a recount of an office is
  7 33 requested, the postelection audit of that office shall not be
  7 34 conducted or shall be terminated, as the case may be.
  7 35    The bill requires the state commissioner of elections to

  6 33 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  6 34    This bill requires a postelection audit after each general
  6 35 election.  The postelection audit is a hand count of the
  7  1 ballots cast in certain contested, partisan offices in selected
  7  2 precincts.  The precincts and offices to be audited are to be
  7  3 selected publicly by lot by the county board of canvassers,
  7  4 except that the office of president of the United States
  7  5 and governor are required to be audited after each general
  7  6 election.
  7  7    The bill provides that the number of precincts to be audited
  7  8 is as follows:
  7  9    In counties with 50,000 or fewer registered voters, two
  7 10 precincts.
  7 11    In counties with more than 50,000 registered voters up to and
  7 12 including 100,000 registered voters, three precincts.

  7 14 and including 200,000 registered voters, four precincts.
  7 15    In counties with more than 200,000 registered voters, six
  7 16 precincts.
  7 17    The bill provides that if the postelection audit reveals
  7 18 a difference greater than one=half of one percent from the
  7 19 results on the printed report from the automatic tabulating
  7 20 equipment, the postelection audit board shall, within two days,
  7 21 conduct an audit of the offices for which such difference
  7 22 was found in at least two additional precincts.  If the
  7 23 second audit also indicates a difference in the vote totals
  7 24 that is greater than one=half of one percent, but no fewer
  7 25 than two votes, from the results on the printed report from
  7 26 the automatic tabulating equipment, the commissioner shall
  7 27 immediately notify the state commissioner of elections.  The
  7 28 state commissioner may direct the commissioner, or any other
  7 29 commissioner of a county where the office appeared on the
  7 30 ballot, to conduct an additional audit of the office in a
  7 31 number of precincts determined by the state commissioner.
  7 32    The bill provides that if a recount of an office is
  7 33 requested, the postelection audit of that office shall not be
  7 34 conducted or shall be terminated, as the case may be.
  7 35    The bill requires the state commissioner of elections to
  8  1 make public the results of postelection audits.
  8  2    The bill takes effect July 1, 2016, and applies to the

  7 25 than two votes, from the results on the printed report from
  7 26 the automatic tabulating equipment, the commissioner shall
  7 27 immediately notify the state commissioner of elections.  The
  7 28 state commissioner may direct the commissioner, or any other

  7  3 selected publicly by lot by the county board of canvassers,

  7 20 equipment, the postelection audit board shall, within two days,
  7 21 conduct an audit of the offices for which such difference
  7 22 was found in at least two additional precincts.  If the
  7 23 second audit also indicates a difference in the vote totals
  7 24 that is greater than one=half of one percent, but no fewer
  7 25 than two votes, from the results on the printed report from
  7 26 the automatic tabulating equipment, the commissioner shall
  7 27 immediately notify the state commissioner of elections.  The
  7 28 state commissioner may direct the commissioner, or any other
  7 29 commissioner of a county where the office appeared on the
  7 30 ballot, to conduct an additional audit of the office in a
  7 31 number of precincts determined by the state commissioner.
  7 32    The bill provides that if a recount of an office is
  7 33 requested, the postelection audit of that office shall not be
  7 34 conducted or shall be terminated, as the case may be.
  7 35    The bill requires the state commissioner of elections to

  7  3 selected publicly by lot by the county board of canvassers,

  7 18 a difference greater than one=half of one percent from the
  7 19 results on the printed report from the automatic tabulating
  7 20 equipment, the postelection audit board shall, within two days,
  7 21 conduct an audit of the offices for which such difference
  7 22 was found in at least two additional precincts.  If the
  7 23 second audit also indicates a difference in the vote totals
  7 24 that is greater than one=half of one percent, but no fewer
  7 25 than two votes, from the results on the printed report from
  7 26 the automatic tabulating equipment, the commissioner shall
  7 27 immediately notify the state commissioner of elections.  The
  7 28 state commissioner may direct the commissioner, or any other
  7 29 commissioner of a county where the office appeared on the
  7 30 ballot, to conduct an additional audit of the office in a
  7 31 number of precincts determined by the state commissioner.
  7 32    The bill provides that if a recount of an office is
  7 33 requested, the postelection audit of that office shall not be
  7 34 conducted or shall be terminated, as the case may be.
  7 35    The bill requires the state commissioner of elections to
  8  1 make public the results of postelection audits.

  6 33 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  6 34    This bill requires a postelection audit after each general
  6 35 election.  The postelection audit is a hand count of the
  7  1 ballots cast in certain contested, partisan offices in selected
  7  2 precincts.  The precincts and offices to be audited are to be
  7  3 selected publicly by lot by the county board of canvassers,
  7  4 except that the office of president of the United States
  7  5 and governor are required to be audited after each general
  7  6 election.
  7  7    The bill provides that the number of precincts to be audited
  7  8 is as follows:
  7  9    In counties with 50,000 or fewer registered voters, two
  7 10 precincts.

  7 14 and including 200,000 registered voters, four precincts.
  7 15    In counties with more than 200,000 registered voters, six
  7 16 precincts.
  7 17    The bill provides that if the postelection audit reveals
  7 18 a difference greater than one=half of one percent from the
  7 19 results on the printed report from the automatic tabulating
  7 20 equipment, the postelection audit board shall, within two days,
  7 21 conduct an audit of the offices for which such difference
  7 22 was found in at least two additional precincts.  If the
  7 23 second audit also indicates a difference in the vote totals
  7 24 that is greater than one=half of one percent, but no fewer
  7 25 than two votes, from the results on the printed report from
  7 26 the automatic tabulating equipment, the commissioner shall
  7 27 immediately notify the state commissioner of elections.  The
  7 28 state commissioner may direct the commissioner, or any other
  7 29 commissioner of a county where the office appeared on the
  7 30 ballot, to conduct an additional audit of the office in a
  7 31 number of precincts determined by the state commissioner.
  7 32    The bill provides that if a recount of an office is
  7 33 requested, the postelection audit of that office shall not be
  7 34 conducted or shall be terminated, as the case may be.
  7 35    The bill requires the state commissioner of elections to
  8  1 make public the results of postelection audits.
  8  2    The bill takes effect July 1, 2016, and applies to the

  8  4 elections.

  6 34    This bill requires a postelection audit after each general

  7  2 precincts.  The precincts and offices to be audited are to be
  7  3 selected publicly by lot by the county board of canvassers,
  7  4 except that the office of president of the United States
  7  5 and governor are required to be audited after each general
  7  6 election.

  7  8 is as follows:
  7  9    In counties with 50,000 or fewer registered voters, two
  7 10 precincts.

  7 16 precincts.

  7 18 a difference greater than one=half of one percent from the
  7 19 results on the printed report from the automatic tabulating
  7 20 equipment, the postelection audit board shall, within two days,
  7 21 conduct an audit of the offices for which such difference
  7 22 was found in at least two additional precincts.  If the
  7 23 second audit also indicates a difference in the vote totals
  7 24 that is greater than one=half of one percent, but no fewer
  7 25 than two votes, from the results on the printed report from
  7 26 the automatic tabulating equipment, the commissioner shall
  7 27 immediately notify the state commissioner of elections.  The
  7 28 state commissioner may direct the commissioner, or any other
  7 29 commissioner of a county where the office appeared on the
  7 30 ballot, to conduct an additional audit of the office in a
  7 31 number of precincts determined by the state commissioner.
  7 32    The bill provides that if a recount of an office is
  7 33 requested, the postelection audit of that office shall not be
  7 34 conducted or shall be terminated, as the case may be.
  7 35    The bill requires the state commissioner of elections to
  8  1 make public the results of postelection audits.
  8  2    The bill takes effect July 1, 2016, and applies to the

  7  3 selected publicly by lot by the county board of canvassers,

  7  5 and governor are required to be audited after each general
  7  6 election.

  7  8 is as follows:
  7  9    In counties with 50,000 or fewer registered voters, two

  7 18 a difference greater than one=half of one percent from the
  7 19 results on the printed report from the automatic tabulating
  7 20 equipment, the postelection audit board shall, within two days,
  7 21 conduct an audit of the offices for which such difference
  7 22 was found in at least two additional precincts.  If the
  7 23 second audit also indicates a difference in the vote totals
  7 24 that is greater than one=half of one percent, but no fewer
  7 25 than two votes, from the results on the printed report from
  7 26 the automatic tabulating equipment, the commissioner shall
  7 27 immediately notify the state commissioner of elections.  The
  7 28 state commissioner may direct the commissioner, or any other
  7 29 commissioner of a county where the office appeared on the
  7 30 ballot, to conduct an additional audit of the office in a
  7 31 number of precincts determined by the state commissioner.
  7 32    The bill provides that if a recount of an office is
  7 33 requested, the postelection audit of that office shall not be
  7 34 conducted or shall be terminated, as the case may be.
  7 35    The bill requires the state commissioner of elections to
  8  1 make public the results of postelection audits.

  7 18 a difference greater than one=half of one percent from the
  7 19 results on the printed report from the automatic tabulating
  7 20 equipment, the postelection audit board shall, within two days,
  7 21 conduct an audit of the offices for which such difference
  7 22 was found in at least two additional precincts.  If the
  7 23 second audit also indicates a difference in the vote totals
  7 24 that is greater than one=half of one percent, but no fewer
  7 25 than two votes, from the results on the printed report from
  7 26 the automatic tabulating equipment, the commissioner shall
  7 27 immediately notify the state commissioner of elections.  The
  7 28 state commissioner may direct the commissioner, or any other
  7 29 commissioner of a county where the office appeared on the
  7 30 ballot, to conduct an additional audit of the office in a
  7 31 number of precincts determined by the state commissioner.
  7 32    The bill provides that if a recount of an office is
  7 33 requested, the postelection audit of that office shall not be
  7 34 conducted or shall be terminated, as the case may be.
  7 35    The bill requires the state commissioner of elections to

  7  3 selected publicly by lot by the county board of canvassers,

  7  5 and governor are required to be audited after each general
  7  6 election.

  7  8 is as follows:
  7  9    In counties with 50,000 or fewer registered voters, two
  7 10 precincts.

  7 18 a difference greater than one=half of one percent from the
  7 19 results on the printed report from the automatic tabulating
  7 20 equipment, the postelection audit board shall, within two days,
  7 21 conduct an audit of the offices for which such difference
  7 22 was found in at least two additional precincts.  If the
  7 23 second audit also indicates a difference in the vote totals
  7 24 that is greater than one=half of one percent, but no fewer
  7 25 than two votes, from the results on the printed report from
  7 26 the automatic tabulating equipment, the commissioner shall
  7 27 immediately notify the state commissioner of elections.  The
  7 28 state commissioner may direct the commissioner, or any other
  7 29 commissioner of a county where the office appeared on the
  7 30 ballot, to conduct an additional audit of the office in a
  7 31 number of precincts determined by the state commissioner.
  7 32    The bill provides that if a recount of an office is
  7 33 requested, the postelection audit of that office shall not be
  7 34 conducted or shall be terminated, as the case may be.
  7 35    The bill requires the state commissioner of elections to

  7 18 a difference greater than one=half of one percent from the

  7 20 equipment, the postelection audit board shall, within two days,
  7 21 conduct an audit of the offices for which such difference
  7 22 was found in at least two additional precincts.  If the
  7 23 second audit also indicates a difference in the vote totals
  7 24 that is greater than one=half of one percent, but no fewer
  7 25 than two votes, from the results on the printed report from
  7 26 the automatic tabulating equipment, the commissioner shall
  7 27 immediately notify the state commissioner of elections.  The
  7 28 state commissioner may direct the commissioner, or any other
  7 29 commissioner of a county where the office appeared on the
  7 30 ballot, to conduct an additional audit of the office in a
  7 31 number of precincts determined by the state commissioner.
  7 32    The bill provides that if a recount of an office is
  7 33 requested, the postelection audit of that office shall not be
  7 34 conducted or shall be terminated, as the case may be.
  7 35    The bill requires the state commissioner of elections to
  8  1 make public the results of postelection audits.

  7  2 precincts.  The precincts and offices to be audited are to be
  7  3 selected publicly by lot by the county board of canvassers,
  7  4 except that the office of president of the United States
  7  5 and governor are required to be audited after each general
  7  6 election.
  7  7    The bill provides that the number of precincts to be audited
  7  8 is as follows:
  7  9    In counties with 50,000 or fewer registered voters, two
  7 10 precincts.
  7 11    In counties with more than 50,000 registered voters up to and
  7 12 including 100,000 registered voters, three precincts.

  7 14 and including 200,000 registered voters, four precincts.
  7 15    In counties with more than 200,000 registered voters, six
  7 16 precincts.
  7 17    The bill provides that if the postelection audit reveals
  7 18 a difference greater than one=half of one percent from the
  7 19 results on the printed report from the automatic tabulating
  7 20 equipment, the postelection audit board shall, within two days,
  7 21 conduct an audit of the offices for which such difference
  7 22 was found in at least two additional precincts.  If the
  7 23 second audit also indicates a difference in the vote totals
  7 24 that is greater than one=half of one percent, but no fewer
  7 25 than two votes, from the results on the printed report from
  7 26 the automatic tabulating equipment, the commissioner shall
  7 27 immediately notify the state commissioner of elections.  The
  7 28 state commissioner may direct the commissioner, or any other
  7 29 commissioner of a county where the office appeared on the
  7 30 ballot, to conduct an additional audit of the office in a
  7 31 number of precincts determined by the state commissioner.
  7 32    The bill provides that if a recount of an office is
  7 33 requested, the postelection audit of that office shall not be
  7 34 conducted or shall be terminated, as the case may be.
  7 35    The bill requires the state commissioner of elections to
  8  1 make public the results of postelection audits.
  8  2    The bill takes effect July 1, 2016, and applies to the
  8  3 general election held in 2016 and all subsequent general
  8  4 elections.

  7  2 precincts.  The precincts and offices to be audited are to be
  7  3 selected publicly by lot by the county board of canvassers,

  7 20 equipment, the postelection audit board shall, within two days,
  7 21 conduct an audit of the offices for which such difference
  7 22 was found in at least two additional precincts.  If the
  7 23 second audit also indicates a difference in the vote totals
  7 24 that is greater than one=half of one percent, but no fewer
  7 25 than two votes, from the results on the printed report from
  7 26 the automatic tabulating equipment, the commissioner shall
  7 27 immediately notify the state commissioner of elections.  The
  7 28 state commissioner may direct the commissioner, or any other
  7 29 commissioner of a county where the office appeared on the
  7 30 ballot, to conduct an additional audit of the office in a
  7 31 number of precincts determined by the state commissioner.
  7 32    The bill provides that if a recount of an office is
  7 33 requested, the postelection audit of that office shall not be
  7 34 conducted or shall be terminated, as the case may be.
  7 35    The bill requires the state commissioner of elections to

  7 24 that is greater than one=half of one percent, but no fewer
  7 25 than two votes, from the results on the printed report from
  7 26 the automatic tabulating equipment, the commissioner shall

  7 22 was found in at least two additional precincts.  If the
  7 23 second audit also indicates a difference in the vote totals
  7 24 that is greater than one=half of one percent, but no fewer
  7 25 than two votes, from the results on the printed report from
  7 26 the automatic tabulating equipment, the commissioner shall
  7 27 immediately notify the state commissioner of elections.  The
  7 28 state commissioner may direct the commissioner, or any other
  7 29 commissioner of a county where the office appeared on the
  7 30 ballot, to conduct an additional audit of the office in a
  7 31 number of precincts determined by the state commissioner.
  7 32    The bill provides that if a recount of an office is

  7 22 was found in at least two additional precincts.  If the
  7 23 second audit also indicates a difference in the vote totals

  7 19 results on the printed report from the automatic tabulating
  7 20 equipment, the postelection audit board shall, within two days,
  7 21 conduct an audit of the offices for which such difference
  7 22 was found in at least two additional precincts.  If the
  7 23 second audit also indicates a difference in the vote totals
  7 24 that is greater than one=half of one percent, but no fewer
  7 25 than two votes, from the results on the printed report from
  7 26 the automatic tabulating equipment, the commissioner shall
  7 27 immediately notify the state commissioner of elections.  The
  7 28 state commissioner may direct the commissioner, or any other
  7 29 commissioner of a county where the office appeared on the
  7 30 ballot, to conduct an additional audit of the office in a
