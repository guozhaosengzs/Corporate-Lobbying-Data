  3 22 projects.
  3 23    The bill defines a "community solar garden project" to
  3 24 mean a facility with a nameplate generating capacity of two
  3 25 megawatts or less that generates electricity by means of a
  3 26 ground=mounted or roof=mounted solar photovoltaic device and
  3 27 that is comprised of a minimum of five subscribers who jointly
  3 28 share the beneficial use of the electricity generated by the
  3 29 project.  The bill defines a "subscriber" to mean a retail
  3 30 customer of an electric utility who owns a subscription and
  3 31 who has identified one or more physical locations to which the
  3 32 subscription shall be attributed or attached.  The bill defines
  3 33 a "subscription" to mean a proportional interest in a community
  3 34 solar garden project, together with a proportional interest
  3 35 in any tax credits for which the facility associated with the
  4  1 project may be eligible.
  4  2    The bill states that the objective of a project shall be to
  4  3 encourage and enhance the ability of public utility customers
  4  4 to participate in and derive benefit from solar energy
  4  5 projects.
  4  6    Regarding project ownership, the bill provides that
  4  7 a project may be established by an electric or any other
  4  8 for=profit or nonprofit entity or organization, including a
  4  9 subscriber organization whose sole purpose is to beneficially
  4 10 own and operate the project.  A project can also be
  4 11 constructed, owned, and operated by a third party under
  4 12 contract with a subscriber organization and pursuant to a
  4 13 lease, sale=leaseback transaction, operating agreement, or
  4 14 other third=party ownership arrangement.
  4 15    The bill provides that physical locations to which
  4 16 subscriptions are attributed or attached must be located within
  4 17 the same county or municipality and within the same electric
  4 18 utility service area.  The bill states that each subscription
  4 19 shall represent at least one kilowatt of a project's generating
  4 20 capacity and shall supply no more than 120 percent of the
  4 21 average annual consumption of electricity by each subscriber
  4 22 at the premises to which the subscription is attributed or
  4 23 attached. The bill authorizes the transfer, assignment, or
  4 24 relocation of subscriptions, under conditions to be determined
  4 25 by the board by rule.
  4 26    The bill states that electricity generated pursuant to
  4 27 a project shall be aggregated and then proportionately
  4 28 allocated to each subscriber, and that excess electricity
  4 29 generated by the project not utilized at the premises to which
  4 30 a subscription is attributed may be sold pursuant to a power
  4 31 purchase agreement entered into with the electric utility
  4 32 at the same rates applicable to alternate energy production
  4 33 facilities pursuant to Code section 476.43.
  4 34    The bill imposes purchase requirements on electric
  4 35 utilities.  The bill states that an electric utility shall
  5  1 enter into one or more power purchase agreements with one
  5  2 or more projects to purchase a minimum of 500 kilowatts of
  5  3 electricity annually. The bill provides that the board may by
  5  4 rule adjust this requirement on or after July 1, 2018, and that
  5  5 subscribers shall qualify for the federal and state tax credits
  5  6 for which the community solar garden facility qualifies on a
  5  7 proportionate basis.
  5  8    The bill provides that a community solar garden project
  5  9 shall not be considered a public utility subject to the
  5 10 regulatory provisions of Code chapter 476, and that such a
  5 11 project does not violate provisions contained in Code chapter
