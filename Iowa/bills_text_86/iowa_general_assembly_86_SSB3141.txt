The
general
assembly
finds
that
a
critical
situation
7


exists
because
of
the
high
cost
and
impending
unavailability
8


of
medical
malpractice
insurance.
The
purposes
of
sections
9


519A.2
to


through
519A.13
are
to
assure
that
the
public
is
10


adequately
protected
against
losses
arising
out
of
medical
11


malpractice
by
providing
licensed
health
care
providers
with
12


medical
malpractice
insurance
through
the
requirement
that
13


certain
liability
insurance
carriers
write
medical
malpractice
14


insurance
for
a
period
of
two
years
upon
a
finding
of
an
15


emergency
by
the
commissioner
of
insurance
that
either
such
16


insurance
is
not
available
through
normal
channels
or
that
17


it
is
not
available
on
a
reasonable
basis
because
of
lack
of
18


competition
for
such
insurance,
or
otherwise;
to
establish
an
19


association
to
equitably
spread
the
risks
for
such
insurance;
20


and
to
provide
for
recoupment
of
losses
resulting
from
the
21


operation
of
the
association
through
a
stabilization
reserve
22


fund
contributed
to
by
insureds,
a
surcharge
on
future
23


liability
insurance
policies,
or
a
favorable
premium
tax
24


treatment.
25


2.


It
is
the
intent
of
this
chapter
to
provide
only
an
26


interim
solution
to
the
impending
unavailability
of
medical
27


malpractice
insurance.
It
is
not
anticipated
that
this
chapter
28


will
resolve
the
underlying
causes
of
the
unavailability
and
29


high
cost
which
extend
beyond
the
insurance
mechanism.
It
is
30


anticipated
that
future
legislation
will
be
required
to
deal
31


on
a
more
permanent
basis
with
the
underlying
causes
of
the

the

is
not

assigned
to
the
governor
of
the
district,
11


but,
rather,
is
vested
in
the
superior
court.
