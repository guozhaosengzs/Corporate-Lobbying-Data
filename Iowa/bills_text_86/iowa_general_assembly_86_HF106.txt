  1  1    Section 1.  FINDINGS AND INTENT.
  1  2    1.  The general assembly finds all of the following:
  1  3    a.  The majority of aging Iowans and individuals with
  1  4 disabilities want to live as independently as possible in their
  1  5 own communities for as long as possible.
  1  6    b.  The increasing number of aging Iowans and individuals
  1  7 with disabilities requires a greater supply of health and
  1  8 long=term care workers.
  1  9    c.  The safety and well=being of Iowans is dependent upon a
  1 10 stable health and long=term care workforce to serve their needs
  1 11 when and where such needs arise.
  1 12    d.  The direct care workforce is America's fastest growing
  1 13 profession, with the need estimated by the state direct care
  1 14 workforce initiative in Iowa to be 20,000 new direct care
  1 15 positions by the year 2020.  However, the number of individuals
  1 16 who typically fill these positions, typically women between the
  1 17 ages of 18 and 44, is dwindling, while those working in the
  1 18 field experience an average annual turnover rate of between 40
  1 19 and 60 percent.
  1 20    e.  High staff turnover cost taxpayers and the state millions
  1 21 of dollars, annually, but more consistent and reliable data on
  1 22 supply, demand, turnover, turnover costs, staffing levels, and
  1 23 various data correlation and other analyses of this critical
  1 24 workforce is needed.
  1 25    f.  Extensive work has already been done to study the issues
  1 26 impacting the direct care workforce and other providers of
  1 27 health and long=term care with significant public and private
  1 28 sector investment, including:
  1 29    (1)  The direct care worker compensation advisory committee
  1 30 which submitted recommendations for consideration by the
  1 31 general assembly in the 2009 legislative session regarding
  1 32 wages and other compensation paid to direct care workers in
  1 33 nursing facilities.  The recommendations included strategies
  1 34 to improve wages and benefits paid to direct care workers
  1 35 employed in Iowa's nursing facilities that, in time, would help
  2  1 to bridge the wage gap for direct care workers in home and
  2  2 community=based and other settings if implemented.
  2  3    (2)  The various initiatives undertaken by the department of
  2  4 public health including the direct care worker task force, the
  2  5 governor's task force on the nursing shortage, the Alzheimer's
  2  6 disease task force, the direct care workforce initiative,
  2  7 and the personal and home care aide state training (PHCAST)
  2  8 project undertaken through a federal grant awarded to only six
  2  9 states in the country to develop and pilot a gold standard of
  2 10 education and training for direct care workers.
  2 11    (3)  The development of a strategic plan for health care
  2 12 delivery infrastructure and health care workforce resources by
  2 13 the health and long=term care access advisory council released
  2 14 in 2010.
  2 15    (4)  The accumulation of relevant data by various state
  2 16 agencies regarding issues impacting the health and long=term
  2 17 care workforce and the impact of not having a quality and
  2 18 stable workforce.
  2 19    g.  All of these studies and initiatives and all of the
  2 20 data collected have demonstrated consistent results, with the
  2 21 overriding recommendation being that a point of coordination
  2 22 should be established to address health and long=term care
  2 23 workforce concerns.
  2 24    h.  (1)  Iowa Code section 135.163 directs the department
  2 25 of public health to coordinate public and private efforts
  2 26 to develop and maintain an appropriate health care delivery
  2 27 infrastructure and a stable, well=qualified, diverse, and
  2 28 sustainable health care workforce in this state to address
  2 29 the broad spectrum of health care needs of Iowans throughout
  2 30 their lifespan including long=term care needs. At a minimum,
  2 31 the department is to develop a strategic plan for health care
  2 32 delivery infrastructure and health care workforce resources
  2 33 in this state; provide for the continuous collection of data
  2 34 to provide a basis for health care strategic planning and
  2 35 health care policymaking; and make recommendations regarding
  3  1 the health care delivery infrastructure and the health care
  3  2 workforce to assist in monitoring current needs, predicting
  3  3 future trends, and informing policymaking.
  3  4    (2)  Iowa Code section 135.11, subsection  27, directs
  3  5 the department of public health to establish and administer,
  3  6 if sufficient funds are available, a program to assess and
  3  7 forecast health workforce supply and demand in the state for
  3  8 the purpose of identifying current and projected workforce
  3  9 needs. The program may collect, analyze, and report data that
  3 10 furthers the purpose of the program. The program shall not
  3 11 release information that permits identification of individual
  3 12 respondents of program surveys.
  3 13    2.  Given that the recommendations of all of the initiatives
  3 14 and studies have consistently called for the establishment of
  3 15 a point of coordination and given the leadership demonstrated
  3 16 by the department of public health and the directives to the
  3 17 department relating to the health and long=term care workforce,
  3 18 it is the intent of the general assembly that an  Iowa health
  3 19 workforce center be established within the department of public
  3 20 health to act as the state's coordination point to address
  3 21 health workforce concerns.
  3 22    a.  It is the intent of the general assembly that the center
  3 23 provide a home   for direct care and other health workforce
  3 24 initiatives across state government, charged with ensuring a
  3 25 more coordinated effort to identify and address various needs
  3 26 and solutions to workforce stability, and focusing on the
  3 27 advancement of a significant body of research, programming, and
  3 28 services proven to be effective in bringing more stability to
  3 29 the health and long=term care workforce.
  3 30    b.  It is the intent of the general assembly that the
  3 31 investment in existing and new strategies funded by the state
  3 32 and the private sector, and carried out by the department, will
  3 33 result in a return on investment through improved utilization
  3 34 of tax dollars which has the potential to result in health care
  3 35 cost containment and reduce Medicaid and other costs related to
  4  1 poor quality of care and staff turnover.
  4  2    c.  It is also the intent of the general assembly that the
  4  3 center provide an opportunity to demonstrate Iowa's continued
  4  4 leadership in the nation as a model in providing quality of
  4  5 life for all of its citizens.

  3 18 it is the intent of the general assembly that an  Iowa health
  3 19 workforce center be established within the department of public
  3 20 health to act as the state's coordination point to address
  3 21 health workforce concerns.
  3 22    a.  It is the intent of the general assembly that the center
  3 23 provide a home   for direct care and other health workforce
  3 24 initiatives across state government, charged with ensuring a
  3 25 more coordinated effort to identify and address various needs
  3 26 and solutions to workforce stability, and focusing on the
  3 27 advancement of a significant body of research, programming, and
  3 28 services proven to be effective in bringing more stability to
  3 29 the health and long=term care workforce.
  3 30    b.  It is the intent of the general assembly that the
  3 31 investment in existing and new strategies funded by the state
  3 32 and the private sector, and carried out by the department, will
  3 33 result in a return on investment through improved utilization
  3 34 of tax dollars which has the potential to result in health care
  3 35 cost containment and reduce Medicaid and other costs related to
  4  1 poor quality of care and staff turnover.
  4  2    c.  It is also the intent of the general assembly that the
  4  3 center provide an opportunity to demonstrate Iowa's continued
  4  4 leadership in the nation as a model in providing quality of
  4  5 life for all of its citizens.

  1  1    Section 1.  FINDINGS AND INTENT.
  1  2    1.  The general assembly finds all of the following:
  1  3    a.  The majority of aging Iowans and individuals with
  1  4 disabilities want to live as independently as possible in their
  1  5 own communities for as long as possible.
  1  6    b.  The increasing number of aging Iowans and individuals
  1  7 with disabilities requires a greater supply of health and
  1  8 long=term care workers.
  1  9    c.  The safety and well=being of Iowans is dependent upon a
  1 10 stable health and long=term care workforce to serve their needs
  1 11 when and where such needs arise.
  1 12    d.  The direct care workforce is America's fastest growing
  1 13 profession, with the need estimated by the state direct care
  1 14 workforce initiative in Iowa to be 20,000 new direct care
  1 15 positions by the year 2020.  However, the number of individuals
  1 16 who typically fill these positions, typically women between the
  1 17 ages of 18 and 44, is dwindling, while those working in the
  1 18 field experience an average annual turnover rate of between 40
  1 19 and 60 percent.
  1 20    e.  High staff turnover cost taxpayers and the state millions
  1 21 of dollars, annually, but more consistent and reliable data on
  1 22 supply, demand, turnover, turnover costs, staffing levels, and
  1 23 various data correlation and other analyses of this critical
  1 24 workforce is needed.
  1 25    f.  Extensive work has already been done to study the issues
  1 26 impacting the direct care workforce and other providers of
  1 27 health and long=term care with significant public and private
  1 28 sector investment, including:
  1 29    (1)  The direct care worker compensation advisory committee
  1 30 which submitted recommendations for consideration by the
  1 31 general assembly in the 2009 legislative session regarding
  1 32 wages and other compensation paid to direct care workers in
  1 33 nursing facilities.  The recommendations included strategies
  1 34 to improve wages and benefits paid to direct care workers
  1 35 employed in Iowa's nursing facilities that, in time, would help
  2  1 to bridge the wage gap for direct care workers in home and
  2  2 community=based and other settings if implemented.
  2  3    (2)  The various initiatives undertaken by the department of
  2  4 public health including the direct care worker task force, the
  2  5 governor's task force on the nursing shortage, the Alzheimer's
  2  6 disease task force, the direct care workforce initiative,
  2  7 and the personal and home care aide state training (PHCAST)
  2  8 project undertaken through a federal grant awarded to only six
  2  9 states in the country to develop and pilot a gold standard of
  2 10 education and training for direct care workers.
  2 11    (3)  The development of a strategic plan for health care
  2 12 delivery infrastructure and health care workforce resources by
  2 13 the health and long=term care access advisory council released
  2 14 in 2010.
  2 15    (4)  The accumulation of relevant data by various state
  2 16 agencies regarding issues impacting the health and long=term
  2 17 care workforce and the impact of not having a quality and
  2 18 stable workforce.
  2 19    g.  All of these studies and initiatives and all of the
  2 20 data collected have demonstrated consistent results, with the
  2 21 overriding recommendation being that a point of coordination
  2 22 should be established to address health and long=term care
  2 23 workforce concerns.
  2 24    h.  (1)  Iowa Code section 135.163 directs the department
  2 25 of public health to coordinate public and private efforts
  2 26 to develop and maintain an appropriate health care delivery
  2 27 infrastructure and a stable, well=qualified, diverse, and
  2 28 sustainable health care workforce in this state to address
  2 29 the broad spectrum of health care needs of Iowans throughout
  2 30 their lifespan including long=term care needs. At a minimum,
  2 31 the department is to develop a strategic plan for health care
  2 32 delivery infrastructure and health care workforce resources
  2 33 in this state; provide for the continuous collection of data
  2 34 to provide a basis for health care strategic planning and
  2 35 health care policymaking; and make recommendations regarding
  3  1 the health care delivery infrastructure and the health care
  3  2 workforce to assist in monitoring current needs, predicting
  3  3 future trends, and informing policymaking.
  3  4    (2)  Iowa Code section 135.11, subsection  27, directs
  3  5 the department of public health to establish and administer,
  3  6 if sufficient funds are available, a program to assess and
  3  7 forecast health workforce supply and demand in the state for
  3  8 the purpose of identifying current and projected workforce
  3  9 needs. The program may collect, analyze, and report data that
  3 10 furthers the purpose of the program. The program shall not
  3 11 release information that permits identification of individual
  3 12 respondents of program surveys.
  3 13    2.  Given that the recommendations of all of the initiatives
  3 14 and studies have consistently called for the establishment of
  3 15 a point of coordination and given the leadership demonstrated
  3 16 by the department of public health and the directives to the
  3 17 department relating to the health and long=term care workforce,
  3 18 it is the intent of the general assembly that an  Iowa health
  3 19 workforce center be established within the department of public
  3 20 health to act as the state's coordination point to address
  3 21 health workforce concerns.
  3 22    a.  It is the intent of the general assembly that the center
  3 23 provide a home   for direct care and other health workforce
  3 24 initiatives across state government, charged with ensuring a
  3 25 more coordinated effort to identify and address various needs

  3 27 advancement of a significant body of research, programming, and
  3 28 services proven to be effective in bringing more stability to
  3 29 the health and long=term care workforce.
  3 30    b.  It is the intent of the general assembly that the
  3 31 investment in existing and new strategies funded by the state
  3 32 and the private sector, and carried out by the department, will
  3 33 result in a return on investment through improved utilization
  3 34 of tax dollars which has the potential to result in health care
  3 35 cost containment and reduce Medicaid and other costs related to
  4  1 poor quality of care and staff turnover.
  4  2    c.  It is also the intent of the general assembly that the

  4  4 leadership in the nation as a model in providing quality of
  4  5 life for all of its citizens.

  1  1    Section 1.  FINDINGS AND INTENT.
  1  2    1.  The general assembly finds all of the following:
  1  3    a.  The majority of aging Iowans and individuals with
  1  4 disabilities want to live as independently as possible in their
  1  5 own communities for as long as possible.
  1  6    b.  The increasing number of aging Iowans and individuals
  1  7 with disabilities requires a greater supply of health and
  1  8 long=term care workers.
  1  9    c.  The safety and well=being of Iowans is dependent upon a
  1 10 stable health and long=term care workforce to serve their needs
  1 11 when and where such needs arise.
  1 12    d.  The direct care workforce is America's fastest growing
  1 13 profession, with the need estimated by the state direct care
  1 14 workforce initiative in Iowa to be 20,000 new direct care
  1 15 positions by the year 2020.  However, the number of individuals
  1 16 who typically fill these positions, typically women between the
  1 17 ages of 18 and 44, is dwindling, while those working in the
  1 18 field experience an average annual turnover rate of between 40
  1 19 and 60 percent.
  1 20    e.  High staff turnover cost taxpayers and the state millions
  1 21 of dollars, annually, but more consistent and reliable data on
  1 22 supply, demand, turnover, turnover costs, staffing levels, and
  1 23 various data correlation and other analyses of this critical
  1 24 workforce is needed.
  1 25    f.  Extensive work has already been done to study the issues
  1 26 impacting the direct care workforce and other providers of
  1 27 health and long=term care with significant public and private
  1 28 sector investment, including:
  1 29    (1)  The direct care worker compensation advisory committee
  1 30 which submitted recommendations for consideration by the
  1 31 general assembly in the 2009 legislative session regarding
  1 32 wages and other compensation paid to direct care workers in
  1 33 nursing facilities.  The recommendations included strategies
  1 34 to improve wages and benefits paid to direct care workers
  1 35 employed in Iowa's nursing facilities that, in time, would help
  2  1 to bridge the wage gap for direct care workers in home and
  2  2 community=based and other settings if implemented.
  2  3    (2)  The various initiatives undertaken by the department of
  2  4 public health including the direct care worker task force, the
  2  5 governor's task force on the nursing shortage, the Alzheimer's
  2  6 disease task force, the direct care workforce initiative,
  2  7 and the personal and home care aide state training (PHCAST)
  2  8 project undertaken through a federal grant awarded to only six
  2  9 states in the country to develop and pilot a gold standard of
  2 10 education and training for direct care workers.
  2 11    (3)  The development of a strategic plan for health care
  2 12 delivery infrastructure and health care workforce resources by
  2 13 the health and long=term care access advisory council released
  2 14 in 2010.
  2 15    (4)  The accumulation of relevant data by various state
  2 16 agencies regarding issues impacting the health and long=term
  2 17 care workforce and the impact of not having a quality and
  2 18 stable workforce.
  2 19    g.  All of these studies and initiatives and all of the
  2 20 data collected have demonstrated consistent results, with the
  2 21 overriding recommendation being that a point of coordination
  2 22 should be established to address health and long=term care
  2 23 workforce concerns.
  2 24    h.  (1)  Iowa Code section 135.163 directs the department
  2 25 of public health to coordinate public and private efforts
  2 26 to develop and maintain an appropriate health care delivery
  2 27 infrastructure and a stable, well=qualified, diverse, and
  2 28 sustainable health care workforce in this state to address
  2 29 the broad spectrum of health care needs of Iowans throughout
  2 30 their lifespan including long=term care needs. At a minimum,
  2 31 the department is to develop a strategic plan for health care
  2 32 delivery infrastructure and health care workforce resources
  2 33 in this state; provide for the continuous collection of data
  2 34 to provide a basis for health care strategic planning and
  2 35 health care policymaking; and make recommendations regarding
  3  1 the health care delivery infrastructure and the health care
  3  2 workforce to assist in monitoring current needs, predicting
  3  3 future trends, and informing policymaking.
  3  4    (2)  Iowa Code section 135.11, subsection  27, directs
  3  5 the department of public health to establish and administer,
  3  6 if sufficient funds are available, a program to assess and
  3  7 forecast health workforce supply and demand in the state for
  3  8 the purpose of identifying current and projected workforce
  3  9 needs. The program may collect, analyze, and report data that
  3 10 furthers the purpose of the program. The program shall not
  3 11 release information that permits identification of individual
  3 12 respondents of program surveys.
  3 13    2.  Given that the recommendations of all of the initiatives
  3 14 and studies have consistently called for the establishment of
  3 15 a point of coordination and given the leadership demonstrated
  3 16 by the department of public health and the directives to the
  3 17 department relating to the health and long=term care workforce,
  3 18 it is the intent of the general assembly that an  Iowa health
  3 19 workforce center be established within the department of public
  3 20 health to act as the state's coordination point to address
  3 21 health workforce concerns.
  3 22    a.  It is the intent of the general assembly that the center
  3 23 provide a home   for direct care and other health workforce
  3 24 initiatives across state government, charged with ensuring a
  3 25 more coordinated effort to identify and address various needs

  3 27 advancement of a significant body of research, programming, and
  3 28 services proven to be effective in bringing more stability to
  3 29 the health and long=term care workforce.
  3 30    b.  It is the intent of the general assembly that the
  3 31 investment in existing and new strategies funded by the state
  3 32 and the private sector, and carried out by the department, will
  3 33 result in a return on investment through improved utilization
  3 34 of tax dollars which has the potential to result in health care
  3 35 cost containment and reduce Medicaid and other costs related to
  4  1 poor quality of care and staff turnover.
  4  2    c.  It is also the intent of the general assembly that the
  4  3 center provide an opportunity to demonstrate Iowa's continued
  4  4 leadership in the nation as a model in providing quality of
  4  5 life for all of its citizens.

  1  1    Section 1.  FINDINGS AND INTENT.
  1  2    1.  The general assembly finds all of the following:
  1  3    a.  The majority of aging Iowans and individuals with
  1  4 disabilities want to live as independently as possible in their
  1  5 own communities for as long as possible.
  1  6    b.  The increasing number of aging Iowans and individuals
  1  7 with disabilities requires a greater supply of health and
  1  8 long=term care workers.
  1  9    c.  The safety and well=being of Iowans is dependent upon a
  1 10 stable health and long=term care workforce to serve their needs
  1 11 when and where such needs arise.
  1 12    d.  The direct care workforce is America's fastest growing
  1 13 profession, with the need estimated by the state direct care
  1 14 workforce initiative in Iowa to be 20,000 new direct care
  1 15 positions by the year 2020.  However, the number of individuals
  1 16 who typically fill these positions, typically women between the
  1 17 ages of 18 and 44, is dwindling, while those working in the
  1 18 field experience an average annual turnover rate of between 40
  1 19 and 60 percent.
  1 20    e.  High staff turnover cost taxpayers and the state millions
  1 21 of dollars, annually, but more consistent and reliable data on
  1 22 supply, demand, turnover, turnover costs, staffing levels, and
  1 23 various data correlation and other analyses of this critical
  1 24 workforce is needed.
  1 25    f.  Extensive work has already been done to study the issues
  1 26 impacting the direct care workforce and other providers of
  1 27 health and long=term care with significant public and private
  1 28 sector investment, including:
  1 29    (1)  The direct care worker compensation advisory committee
  1 30 which submitted recommendations for consideration by the
  1 31 general assembly in the 2009 legislative session regarding
  1 32 wages and other compensation paid to direct care workers in
  1 33 nursing facilities.  The recommendations included strategies
  1 34 to improve wages and benefits paid to direct care workers
  1 35 employed in Iowa's nursing facilities that, in time, would help
  2  1 to bridge the wage gap for direct care workers in home and
  2  2 community=based and other settings if implemented.
  2  3    (2)  The various initiatives undertaken by the department of
  2  4 public health including the direct care worker task force, the
  2  5 governor's task force on the nursing shortage, the Alzheimer's
  2  6 disease task force, the direct care workforce initiative,
  2  7 and the personal and home care aide state training (PHCAST)
  2  8 project undertaken through a federal grant awarded to only six
  2  9 states in the country to develop and pilot a gold standard of
  2 10 education and training for direct care workers.
  2 11    (3)  The development of a strategic plan for health care
  2 12 delivery infrastructure and health care workforce resources by
  2 13 the health and long=term care access advisory council released
  2 14 in 2010.
  2 15    (4)  The accumulation of relevant data by various state
  2 16 agencies regarding issues impacting the health and long=term
  2 17 care workforce and the impact of not having a quality and
  2 18 stable workforce.
  2 19    g.  All of these studies and initiatives and all of the
  2 20 data collected have demonstrated consistent results, with the
  2 21 overriding recommendation being that a point of coordination
  2 22 should be established to address health and long=term care
  2 23 workforce concerns.
  2 24    h.  (1)  Iowa Code section 135.163 directs the department
  2 25 of public health to coordinate public and private efforts
  2 26 to develop and maintain an appropriate health care delivery
  2 27 infrastructure and a stable, well=qualified, diverse, and
  2 28 sustainable health care workforce in this state to address
  2 29 the broad spectrum of health care needs of Iowans throughout
  2 30 their lifespan including long=term care needs. At a minimum,
  2 31 the department is to develop a strategic plan for health care
  2 32 delivery infrastructure and health care workforce resources
  2 33 in this state; provide for the continuous collection of data
  2 34 to provide a basis for health care strategic planning and
  2 35 health care policymaking; and make recommendations regarding
  3  1 the health care delivery infrastructure and the health care
  3  2 workforce to assist in monitoring current needs, predicting
  3  3 future trends, and informing policymaking.
  3  4    (2)  Iowa Code section 135.11, subsection  27, directs
  3  5 the department of public health to establish and administer,
  3  6 if sufficient funds are available, a program to assess and
  3  7 forecast health workforce supply and demand in the state for
  3  8 the purpose of identifying current and projected workforce
  3  9 needs. The program may collect, analyze, and report data that
  3 10 furthers the purpose of the program. The program shall not
  3 11 release information that permits identification of individual
  3 12 respondents of program surveys.
  3 13    2.  Given that the recommendations of all of the initiatives
  3 14 and studies have consistently called for the establishment of
  3 15 a point of coordination and given the leadership demonstrated
  3 16 by the department of public health and the directives to the
  3 17 department relating to the health and long=term care workforce,
  3 18 it is the intent of the general assembly that an  Iowa health
  3 19 workforce center be established within the department of public
  3 20 health to act as the state's coordination point to address
  3 21 health workforce concerns.
  3 22    a.  It is the intent of the general assembly that the center
  3 23 provide a home   for direct care and other health workforce
  3 24 initiatives across state government, charged with ensuring a
  3 25 more coordinated effort to identify and address various needs
  3 26 and solutions to workforce stability, and focusing on the
  3 27 advancement of a significant body of research, programming, and
  3 28 services proven to be effective in bringing more stability to
  3 29 the health and long=term care workforce.
  3 30    b.  It is the intent of the general assembly that the
  3 31 investment in existing and new strategies funded by the state
  3 32 and the private sector, and carried out by the department, will
  3 33 result in a return on investment through improved utilization
  3 34 of tax dollars which has the potential to result in health care
  3 35 cost containment and reduce Medicaid and other costs related to
  4  1 poor quality of care and staff turnover.
  4  2    c.  It is also the intent of the general assembly that the
  4  3 center provide an opportunity to demonstrate Iowa's continued
  4  4 leadership in the nation as a model in providing quality of
  4  5 life for all of its citizens.

  2 28 sustainable health care workforce in this state to address
  2 29 the broad spectrum of health care needs of Iowans throughout

  2 31 the department is to develop a strategic plan for health care
  2 32 delivery infrastructure and health care workforce resources
  2 33 in this state; provide for the continuous collection of data
  2 34 to provide a basis for health care strategic planning and
  2 35 health care policymaking; and make recommendations regarding
  3  1 the health care delivery infrastructure and the health care
  3  2 workforce to assist in monitoring current needs, predicting
  3  3 future trends, and informing policymaking.
  3  4    (2)  Iowa Code section 135.11, subsection  27, directs
  3  5 the department of public health to establish and administer,

  3 14 and studies have consistently called for the establishment of
  3 15 a point of coordination and given the leadership demonstrated
  3 16 by the department of public health and the directives to the
  3 17 department relating to the health and long=term care workforce,
  3 18 it is the intent of the general assembly that an  Iowa health
  3 19 workforce center be established within the department of public
  3 20 health to act as the state's coordination point to address
  3 21 health workforce concerns.
  3 22    a.  It is the intent of the general assembly that the center
  3 23 provide a home   for direct care and other health workforce
  3 24 initiatives across state government, charged with ensuring a
  3 25 more coordinated effort to identify and address various needs
  3 26 and solutions to workforce stability, and focusing on the
  3 27 advancement of a significant body of research, programming, and
  3 28 services proven to be effective in bringing more stability to
  3 29 the health and long=term care workforce.
  3 30    b.  It is the intent of the general assembly that the

  3 32 and the private sector, and carried out by the department, will
  3 33 result in a return on investment through improved utilization
  3 34 of tax dollars which has the potential to result in health care

  1  1    Section 1.  FINDINGS AND INTENT.
  1  2    1.  The general assembly finds all of the following:
  1  3    a.  The majority of aging Iowans and individuals with
  1  4 disabilities want to live as independently as possible in their
  1  5 own communities for as long as possible.
  1  6    b.  The increasing number of aging Iowans and individuals
  1  7 with disabilities requires a greater supply of health and
  1  8 long=term care workers.
  1  9    c.  The safety and well=being of Iowans is dependent upon a
  1 10 stable health and long=term care workforce to serve their needs
  1 11 when and where such needs arise.
  1 12    d.  The direct care workforce is America's fastest growing
  1 13 profession, with the need estimated by the state direct care
  1 14 workforce initiative in Iowa to be 20,000 new direct care
  1 15 positions by the year 2020.  However, the number of individuals
  1 16 who typically fill these positions, typically women between the
  1 17 ages of 18 and 44, is dwindling, while those working in the
  1 18 field experience an average annual turnover rate of between 40
  1 19 and 60 percent.
  1 20    e.  High staff turnover cost taxpayers and the state millions
  1 21 of dollars, annually, but more consistent and reliable data on
  1 22 supply, demand, turnover, turnover costs, staffing levels, and
  1 23 various data correlation and other analyses of this critical
  1 24 workforce is needed.
  1 25    f.  Extensive work has already been done to study the issues
  1 26 impacting the direct care workforce and other providers of
  1 27 health and long=term care with significant public and private
  1 28 sector investment, including:
  1 29    (1)  The direct care worker compensation advisory committee
  1 30 which submitted recommendations for consideration by the
  1 31 general assembly in the 2009 legislative session regarding
  1 32 wages and other compensation paid to direct care workers in
  1 33 nursing facilities.  The recommendations included strategies
  1 34 to improve wages and benefits paid to direct care workers
  1 35 employed in Iowa's nursing facilities that, in time, would help

  1  1    Section 1.  FINDINGS AND INTENT.
  1  2    1.  The general assembly finds all of the following:
  1  3    a.  The majority of aging Iowans and individuals with
  1  4 disabilities want to live as independently as possible in their
  1  5 own communities for as long as possible.
  1  6    b.  The increasing number of aging Iowans and individuals
  1  7 with disabilities requires a greater supply of health and
  1  8 long=term care workers.
  1  9    c.  The safety and well=being of Iowans is dependent upon a
  1 10 stable health and long=term care workforce to serve their needs
  1 11 when and where such needs arise.
  1 12    d.  The direct care workforce is America's fastest growing
  1 13 profession, with the need estimated by the state direct care
  1 14 workforce initiative in Iowa to be 20,000 new direct care
  1 15 positions by the year 2020.  However, the number of individuals
  1 16 who typically fill these positions, typically women between the
  1 17 ages of 18 and 44, is dwindling, while those working in the
  1 18 field experience an average annual turnover rate of between 40
  1 19 and 60 percent.
  1 20    e.  High staff turnover cost taxpayers and the state millions
  1 21 of dollars, annually, but more consistent and reliable data on
  1 22 supply, demand, turnover, turnover costs, staffing levels, and
  1 23 various data correlation and other analyses of this critical
  1 24 workforce is needed.
  1 25    f.  Extensive work has already been done to study the issues
  1 26 impacting the direct care workforce and other providers of
  1 27 health and long=term care with significant public and private
  1 28 sector investment, including:
  1 29    (1)  The direct care worker compensation advisory committee
  1 30 which submitted recommendations for consideration by the
  1 31 general assembly in the 2009 legislative session regarding
  1 32 wages and other compensation paid to direct care workers in
  1 33 nursing facilities.  The recommendations included strategies
  1 34 to improve wages and benefits paid to direct care workers
  1 35 employed in Iowa's nursing facilities that, in time, would help
  2  1 to bridge the wage gap for direct care workers in home and
  2  2 community=based and other settings if implemented.
  2  3    (2)  The various initiatives undertaken by the department of
  2  4 public health including the direct care worker task force, the
  2  5 governor's task force on the nursing shortage, the Alzheimer's
  2  6 disease task force, the direct care workforce initiative,
  2  7 and the personal and home care aide state training (PHCAST)
  2  8 project undertaken through a federal grant awarded to only six
  2  9 states in the country to develop and pilot a gold standard of
  2 10 education and training for direct care workers.
  2 11    (3)  The development of a strategic plan for health care
  2 12 delivery infrastructure and health care workforce resources by
  2 13 the health and long=term care access advisory council released
  2 14 in 2010.
  2 15    (4)  The accumulation of relevant data by various state
  2 16 agencies regarding issues impacting the health and long=term
  2 17 care workforce and the impact of not having a quality and
  2 18 stable workforce.
  2 19    g.  All of these studies and initiatives and all of the
  2 20 data collected have demonstrated consistent results, with the
  2 21 overriding recommendation being that a point of coordination
  2 22 should be established to address health and long=term care
  2 23 workforce concerns.
  2 24    h.  (1)  Iowa Code section 135.163 directs the department
  2 25 of public health to coordinate public and private efforts
  2 26 to develop and maintain an appropriate health care delivery
  2 27 infrastructure and a stable, well=qualified, diverse, and
  2 28 sustainable health care workforce in this state to address
  2 29 the broad spectrum of health care needs of Iowans throughout
  2 30 their lifespan including long=term care needs. At a minimum,
  2 31 the department is to develop a strategic plan for health care
  2 32 delivery infrastructure and health care workforce resources
  2 33 in this state; provide for the continuous collection of data
  2 34 to provide a basis for health care strategic planning and
  2 35 health care policymaking; and make recommendations regarding
  3  1 the health care delivery infrastructure and the health care
  3  2 workforce to assist in monitoring current needs, predicting
  3  3 future trends, and informing policymaking.
  3  4    (2)  Iowa Code section 135.11, subsection  27, directs
  3  5 the department of public health to establish and administer,
  3  6 if sufficient funds are available, a program to assess and
  3  7 forecast health workforce supply and demand in the state for
  3  8 the purpose of identifying current and projected workforce
  3  9 needs. The program may collect, analyze, and report data that
  3 10 furthers the purpose of the program. The program shall not
  3 11 release information that permits identification of individual
  3 12 respondents of program surveys.
  3 13    2.  Given that the recommendations of all of the initiatives
  3 14 and studies have consistently called for the establishment of
  3 15 a point of coordination and given the leadership demonstrated
  3 16 by the department of public health and the directives to the
  3 17 department relating to the health and long=term care workforce,
  3 18 it is the intent of the general assembly that an  Iowa health
  3 19 workforce center be established within the department of public
  3 20 health to act as the state's coordination point to address
  3 21 health workforce concerns.
  3 22    a.  It is the intent of the general assembly that the center
  3 23 provide a home   for direct care and other health workforce
  3 24 initiatives across state government, charged with ensuring a
  3 25 more coordinated effort to identify and address various needs
  3 26 and solutions to workforce stability, and focusing on the
  3 27 advancement of a significant body of research, programming, and
  3 28 services proven to be effective in bringing more stability to
  3 29 the health and long=term care workforce.
  3 30    b.  It is the intent of the general assembly that the
  3 31 investment in existing and new strategies funded by the state
  3 32 and the private sector, and carried out by the department, will
  3 33 result in a return on investment through improved utilization
  3 34 of tax dollars which has the potential to result in health care
  3 35 cost containment and reduce Medicaid and other costs related to
  4  1 poor quality of care and staff turnover.
  4  2    c.  It is also the intent of the general assembly that the
  4  3 center provide an opportunity to demonstrate Iowa's continued
  4  4 leadership in the nation as a model in providing quality of
  4  5 life for all of its citizens.

  1  1    Section 1.  FINDINGS AND INTENT.
  1  2    1.  The general assembly finds all of the following:
  1  3    a.  The majority of aging Iowans and individuals with
  1  4 disabilities want to live as independently as possible in their
  1  5 own communities for as long as possible.
  1  6    b.  The increasing number of aging Iowans and individuals
  1  7 with disabilities requires a greater supply of health and
  1  8 long=term care workers.
  1  9    c.  The safety and well=being of Iowans is dependent upon a
  1 10 stable health and long=term care workforce to serve their needs
  1 11 when and where such needs arise.
  1 12    d.  The direct care workforce is America's fastest growing
  1 13 profession, with the need estimated by the state direct care
  1 14 workforce initiative in Iowa to be 20,000 new direct care
  1 15 positions by the year 2020.  However, the number of individuals
  1 16 who typically fill these positions, typically women between the
  1 17 ages of 18 and 44, is dwindling, while those working in the
  1 18 field experience an average annual turnover rate of between 40
  1 19 and 60 percent.
  1 20    e.  High staff turnover cost taxpayers and the state millions
  1 21 of dollars, annually, but more consistent and reliable data on
  1 22 supply, demand, turnover, turnover costs, staffing levels, and
  1 23 various data correlation and other analyses of this critical
  1 24 workforce is needed.
  1 25    f.  Extensive work has already been done to study the issues
  1 26 impacting the direct care workforce and other providers of
  1 27 health and long=term care with significant public and private
  1 28 sector investment, including:
  1 29    (1)  The direct care worker compensation advisory committee
  1 30 which submitted recommendations for consideration by the
  1 31 general assembly in the 2009 legislative session regarding
  1 32 wages and other compensation paid to direct care workers in
  1 33 nursing facilities.  The recommendations included strategies
  1 34 to improve wages and benefits paid to direct care workers
  1 35 employed in Iowa's nursing facilities that, in time, would help
  2  1 to bridge the wage gap for direct care workers in home and
  2  2 community=based and other settings if implemented.
  2  3    (2)  The various initiatives undertaken by the department of
  2  4 public health including the direct care worker task force, the
  2  5 governor's task force on the nursing shortage, the Alzheimer's
  2  6 disease task force, the direct care workforce initiative,
  2  7 and the personal and home care aide state training (PHCAST)
  2  8 project undertaken through a federal grant awarded to only six
  2  9 states in the country to develop and pilot a gold standard of
  2 10 education and training for direct care workers.
  2 11    (3)  The development of a strategic plan for health care
  2 12 delivery infrastructure and health care workforce resources by
  2 13 the health and long=term care access advisory council released
  2 14 in 2010.
  2 15    (4)  The accumulation of relevant data by various state
  2 16 agencies regarding issues impacting the health and long=term
  2 17 care workforce and the impact of not having a quality and
  2 18 stable workforce.
  2 19    g.  All of these studies and initiatives and all of the
  2 20 data collected have demonstrated consistent results, with the
  2 21 overriding recommendation being that a point of coordination
  2 22 should be established to address health and long=term care
  2 23 workforce concerns.
  2 24    h.  (1)  Iowa Code section 135.163 directs the department
  2 25 of public health to coordinate public and private efforts
  2 26 to develop and maintain an appropriate health care delivery
  2 27 infrastructure and a stable, well=qualified, diverse, and
  2 28 sustainable health care workforce in this state to address
  2 29 the broad spectrum of health care needs of Iowans throughout
  2 30 their lifespan including long=term care needs. At a minimum,
  2 31 the department is to develop a strategic plan for health care
  2 32 delivery infrastructure and health care workforce resources
  2 33 in this state; provide for the continuous collection of data
  2 34 to provide a basis for health care strategic planning and
  2 35 health care policymaking; and make recommendations regarding
  3  1 the health care delivery infrastructure and the health care
  3  2 workforce to assist in monitoring current needs, predicting
  3  3 future trends, and informing policymaking.
  3  4    (2)  Iowa Code section 135.11, subsection  27, directs
  3  5 the department of public health to establish and administer,
  3  6 if sufficient funds are available, a program to assess and
  3  7 forecast health workforce supply and demand in the state for
  3  8 the purpose of identifying current and projected workforce
  3  9 needs. The program may collect, analyze, and report data that
  3 10 furthers the purpose of the program. The program shall not
  3 11 release information that permits identification of individual
  3 12 respondents of program surveys.
  3 13    2.  Given that the recommendations of all of the initiatives
  3 14 and studies have consistently called for the establishment of
  3 15 a point of coordination and given the leadership demonstrated

  2 25 of public health to coordinate public and private efforts
  2 26 to develop and maintain an appropriate health care delivery
  2 27 infrastructure and a stable, well=qualified, diverse, and
  2 28 sustainable health care workforce in this state to address
  2 29 the broad spectrum of health care needs of Iowans throughout
  2 30 their lifespan including long=term care needs. At a minimum,
  2 31 the department is to develop a strategic plan for health care
  2 32 delivery infrastructure and health care workforce resources
  2 33 in this state; provide for the continuous collection of data
  2 34 to provide a basis for health care strategic planning and
  2 35 health care policymaking; and make recommendations regarding
  3  1 the health care delivery infrastructure and the health care
  3  2 workforce to assist in monitoring current needs, predicting
  3  3 future trends, and informing policymaking.
  3  4    (2)  Iowa Code section 135.11, subsection  27, directs
  3  5 the department of public health to establish and administer,
  3  6 if sufficient funds are available, a program to assess and
  3  7 forecast health workforce supply and demand in the state for
  3  8 the purpose of identifying current and projected workforce
  3  9 needs. The program may collect, analyze, and report data that
  3 10 furthers the purpose of the program. The program shall not
  3 11 release information that permits identification of individual
  3 12 respondents of program surveys.
  3 13    2.  Given that the recommendations of all of the initiatives
  3 14 and studies have consistently called for the establishment of
  3 15 a point of coordination and given the leadership demonstrated
  3 16 by the department of public health and the directives to the
  3 17 department relating to the health and long=term care workforce,
  3 18 it is the intent of the general assembly that an  Iowa health
  3 19 workforce center be established within the department of public
  3 20 health to act as the state's coordination point to address
  3 21 health workforce concerns.
  3 22    a.  It is the intent of the general assembly that the center
  3 23 provide a home   for direct care and other health workforce
  3 24 initiatives across state government, charged with ensuring a
  3 25 more coordinated effort to identify and address various needs
  3 26 and solutions to workforce stability, and focusing on the
  3 27 advancement of a significant body of research, programming, and
  3 28 services proven to be effective in bringing more stability to
  3 29 the health and long=term care workforce.
  3 30    b.  It is the intent of the general assembly that the
  3 31 investment in existing and new strategies funded by the state
  3 32 and the private sector, and carried out by the department, will
  3 33 result in a return on investment through improved utilization
  3 34 of tax dollars which has the potential to result in health care
  3 35 cost containment and reduce Medicaid and other costs related to
  4  1 poor quality of care and staff turnover.
  4  2    c.  It is also the intent of the general assembly that the
  4  3 center provide an opportunity to demonstrate Iowa's continued
  4  4 leadership in the nation as a model in providing quality of
  4  5 life for all of its citizens.

  1  1    Section 1.  FINDINGS AND INTENT.
  1  2    1.  The general assembly finds all of the following:
  1  3    a.  The majority of aging Iowans and individuals with
  1  4 disabilities want to live as independently as possible in their
  1  5 own communities for as long as possible.
  1  6    b.  The increasing number of aging Iowans and individuals
  1  7 with disabilities requires a greater supply of health and
  1  8 long=term care workers.
  1  9    c.  The safety and well=being of Iowans is dependent upon a
  1 10 stable health and long=term care workforce to serve their needs
  1 11 when and where such needs arise.
  1 12    d.  The direct care workforce is America's fastest growing
  1 13 profession, with the need estimated by the state direct care
  1 14 workforce initiative in Iowa to be 20,000 new direct care
  1 15 positions by the year 2020.  However, the number of individuals
  1 16 who typically fill these positions, typically women between the
  1 17 ages of 18 and 44, is dwindling, while those working in the
  1 18 field experience an average annual turnover rate of between 40
  1 19 and 60 percent.
  1 20    e.  High staff turnover cost taxpayers and the state millions
  1 21 of dollars, annually, but more consistent and reliable data on
  1 22 supply, demand, turnover, turnover costs, staffing levels, and
  1 23 various data correlation and other analyses of this critical
  1 24 workforce is needed.
  1 25    f.  Extensive work has already been done to study the issues
  1 26 impacting the direct care workforce and other providers of
  1 27 health and long=term care with significant public and private
  1 28 sector investment, including:
  1 29    (1)  The direct care worker compensation advisory committee
  1 30 which submitted recommendations for consideration by the
  1 31 general assembly in the 2009 legislative session regarding
  1 32 wages and other compensation paid to direct care workers in
  1 33 nursing facilities.  The recommendations included strategies
  1 34 to improve wages and benefits paid to direct care workers
  1 35 employed in Iowa's nursing facilities that, in time, would help
  2  1 to bridge the wage gap for direct care workers in home and
  2  2 community=based and other settings if implemented.
  2  3    (2)  The various initiatives undertaken by the department of
  2  4 public health including the direct care worker task force, the
  2  5 governor's task force on the nursing shortage, the Alzheimer's
  2  6 disease task force, the direct care workforce initiative,
  2  7 and the personal and home care aide state training (PHCAST)
  2  8 project undertaken through a federal grant awarded to only six
  2  9 states in the country to develop and pilot a gold standard of
  2 10 education and training for direct care workers.
  2 11    (3)  The development of a strategic plan for health care
  2 12 delivery infrastructure and health care workforce resources by
  2 13 the health and long=term care access advisory council released
  2 14 in 2010.
  2 15    (4)  The accumulation of relevant data by various state
  2 16 agencies regarding issues impacting the health and long=term
  2 17 care workforce and the impact of not having a quality and
  2 18 stable workforce.
  2 19    g.  All of these studies and initiatives and all of the
  2 20 data collected have demonstrated consistent results, with the
  2 21 overriding recommendation being that a point of coordination
  2 22 should be established to address health and long=term care
  2 23 workforce concerns.

  2 28 sustainable health care workforce in this state to address
  2 29 the broad spectrum of health care needs of Iowans throughout
  2 30 their lifespan including long=term care needs. At a minimum,
  2 31 the department is to develop a strategic plan for health care
  2 32 delivery infrastructure and health care workforce resources
  2 33 in this state; provide for the continuous collection of data
  2 34 to provide a basis for health care strategic planning and
  2 35 health care policymaking; and make recommendations regarding

  3  8 the purpose of identifying current and projected workforce
  3  9 needs. The program may collect, analyze, and report data that
  3 10 furthers the purpose of the program. The program shall not
  3 11 release information that permits identification of individual
  3 12 respondents of program surveys.
  3 13    2.  Given that the recommendations of all of the initiatives
  3 14 and studies have consistently called for the establishment of
  3 15 a point of coordination and given the leadership demonstrated
  3 16 by the department of public health and the directives to the
  3 17 department relating to the health and long=term care workforce,
  3 18 it is the intent of the general assembly that an  Iowa health
  3 19 workforce center be established within the department of public
  3 20 health to act as the state's coordination point to address
  3 21 health workforce concerns.
  3 22    a.  It is the intent of the general assembly that the center
  3 23 provide a home   for direct care and other health workforce
  3 24 initiatives across state government, charged with ensuring a
  3 25 more coordinated effort to identify and address various needs
  3 26 and solutions to workforce stability, and focusing on the

  3 28 services proven to be effective in bringing more stability to
  3 29 the health and long=term care workforce.
  3 30    b.  It is the intent of the general assembly that the
  3 31 investment in existing and new strategies funded by the state
  3 32 and the private sector, and carried out by the department, will
  3 33 result in a return on investment through improved utilization
  3 34 of tax dollars which has the potential to result in health care
  3 35 cost containment and reduce Medicaid and other costs related to
  4  1 poor quality of care and staff turnover.
  4  2    c.  It is also the intent of the general assembly that the
  4  3 center provide an opportunity to demonstrate Iowa's continued

  1 13 profession, with the need estimated by the state direct care
  1 14 workforce initiative in Iowa to be 20,000 new direct care
  1 15 positions by the year 2020.  However, the number of individuals
  1 16 who typically fill these positions, typically women between the
  1 17 ages of 18 and 44, is dwindling, while those working in the
  1 18 field experience an average annual turnover rate of between 40
  1 19 and 60 percent.

  1 21 of dollars, annually, but more consistent and reliable data on
  1 22 supply, demand, turnover, turnover costs, staffing levels, and
  1 23 various data correlation and other analyses of this critical
  1 24 workforce is needed.

  1 26 impacting the direct care workforce and other providers of
  1 27 health and long=term care with significant public and private
  1 28 sector investment, including:
  1 29    (1)  The direct care worker compensation advisory committee
  1 30 which submitted recommendations for consideration by the
  1 31 general assembly in the 2009 legislative session regarding
  1 32 wages and other compensation paid to direct care workers in
  1 33 nursing facilities.  The recommendations included strategies
  1 34 to improve wages and benefits paid to direct care workers

  2 28 sustainable health care workforce in this state to address
  2 29 the broad spectrum of health care needs of Iowans throughout
  2 30 their lifespan including long=term care needs. At a minimum,
  2 31 the department is to develop a strategic plan for health care
  2 32 delivery infrastructure and health care workforce resources
  2 33 in this state; provide for the continuous collection of data
  2 34 to provide a basis for health care strategic planning and
  2 35 health care policymaking; and make recommendations regarding
  3  1 the health care delivery infrastructure and the health care
  3  2 workforce to assist in monitoring current needs, predicting
  3  3 future trends, and informing policymaking.
  3  4    (2)  Iowa Code section 135.11, subsection  27, directs

  3  8 the purpose of identifying current and projected workforce
  3  9 needs. The program may collect, analyze, and report data that
  3 10 furthers the purpose of the program. The program shall not
  3 11 release information that permits identification of individual
  3 12 respondents of program surveys.
  3 13    2.  Given that the recommendations of all of the initiatives
  3 14 and studies have consistently called for the establishment of
  3 15 a point of coordination and given the leadership demonstrated

  3 17 department relating to the health and long=term care workforce,
  3 18 it is the intent of the general assembly that an  Iowa health
  3 19 workforce center be established within the department of public
  3 20 health to act as the state's coordination point to address
  3 21 health workforce concerns.
  3 22    a.  It is the intent of the general assembly that the center
  3 23 provide a home   for direct care and other health workforce
  3 24 initiatives across state government, charged with ensuring a
  3 25 more coordinated effort to identify and address various needs
  3 26 and solutions to workforce stability, and focusing on the
  3 27 advancement of a significant body of research, programming, and
  3 28 services proven to be effective in bringing more stability to
  3 29 the health and long=term care workforce.
  3 30    b.  It is the intent of the general assembly that the
  3 31 investment in existing and new strategies funded by the state
  3 32 and the private sector, and carried out by the department, will
  3 33 result in a return on investment through improved utilization
  3 34 of tax dollars which has the potential to result in health care
  3 35 cost containment and reduce Medicaid and other costs related to
  4  1 poor quality of care and staff turnover.
  4  2    c.  It is also the intent of the general assembly that the
  4  3 center provide an opportunity to demonstrate Iowa's continued

  1 12    d.  The direct care workforce is America's fastest growing
  1 13 profession, with the need estimated by the state direct care
  1 14 workforce initiative in Iowa to be 20,000 new direct care
  1 15 positions by the year 2020.  However, the number of individuals
  1 16 who typically fill these positions, typically women between the
  1 17 ages of 18 and 44, is dwindling, while those working in the
  1 18 field experience an average annual turnover rate of between 40
  1 19 and 60 percent.
  1 20    e.  High staff turnover cost taxpayers and the state millions
  1 21 of dollars, annually, but more consistent and reliable data on
  1 22 supply, demand, turnover, turnover costs, staffing levels, and
  1 23 various data correlation and other analyses of this critical

  1 30 which submitted recommendations for consideration by the
  1 31 general assembly in the 2009 legislative session regarding
  1 32 wages and other compensation paid to direct care workers in
  1 33 nursing facilities.  The recommendations included strategies
  1 34 to improve wages and benefits paid to direct care workers
  1 35 employed in Iowa's nursing facilities that, in time, would help
  2  1 to bridge the wage gap for direct care workers in home and
  2  2 community=based and other settings if implemented.

  3  1 the health care delivery infrastructure and the health care
  3  2 workforce to assist in monitoring current needs, predicting
  3  3 future trends, and informing policymaking.
  3  4    (2)  Iowa Code section 135.11, subsection  27, directs
  3  5 the department of public health to establish and administer,
  3  6 if sufficient funds are available, a program to assess and
  3  7 forecast health workforce supply and demand in the state for
  3  8 the purpose of identifying current and projected workforce
  3  9 needs. The program may collect, analyze, and report data that
  3 10 furthers the purpose of the program. The program shall not
  3 11 release information that permits identification of individual
  3 12 respondents of program surveys.
  3 13    2.  Given that the recommendations of all of the initiatives
  3 14 and studies have consistently called for the establishment of
  3 15 a point of coordination and given the leadership demonstrated
  3 16 by the department of public health and the directives to the
  3 17 department relating to the health and long=term care workforce,
  3 18 it is the intent of the general assembly that an  Iowa health
  3 19 workforce center be established within the department of public
  3 20 health to act as the state's coordination point to address
  3 21 health workforce concerns.
  3 22    a.  It is the intent of the general assembly that the center
  3 23 provide a home   for direct care and other health workforce
  3 24 initiatives across state government, charged with ensuring a
  3 25 more coordinated effort to identify and address various needs
  3 26 and solutions to workforce stability, and focusing on the
  3 27 advancement of a significant body of research, programming, and
  3 28 services proven to be effective in bringing more stability to
  3 29 the health and long=term care workforce.
  3 30    b.  It is the intent of the general assembly that the
  3 31 investment in existing and new strategies funded by the state
  3 32 and the private sector, and carried out by the department, will
  3 33 result in a return on investment through improved utilization
  3 34 of tax dollars which has the potential to result in health care
  3 35 cost containment and reduce Medicaid and other costs related to
  4  1 poor quality of care and staff turnover.
  4  2    c.  It is also the intent of the general assembly that the
  4  3 center provide an opportunity to demonstrate Iowa's continued
  4  4 leadership in the nation as a model in providing quality of
  4  5 life for all of its citizens.
  4  6    Sec. 2.    1 12    d.  The direct care workforce is America's fastest growing
  1 13 profession, with the need estimated by the state direct care
  1 14 workforce initiative in Iowa to be 20,000 new direct care
  1 15 positions by the year 2020.  However, the number of individuals
  1 16 who typically fill these positions, typically women between the
  1 17 ages of 18 and 44, is dwindling, while those working in the
  1 18 field experience an average annual turnover rate of between 40
  1 19 and 60 percent.
  1 20    e.  High staff turnover cost taxpayers and the state millions
  1 21 of dollars, annually, but more consistent and reliable data on
  1 22 supply, demand, turnover, turnover costs, staffing levels, and
  1 23 various data correlation and other analyses of this critical
  1 24 workforce is needed.
  1 25    f.  Extensive work has already been done to study the issues
  1 26 impacting the direct care workforce and other providers of
  1 27 health and long=term care with significant public and private
  1 28 sector investment, including:
  1 29    (1)  The direct care worker compensation advisory committee
  1 30 which submitted recommendations for consideration by the
  1 31 general assembly in the 2009 legislative session regarding
  1 32 wages and other compensation paid to direct care workers in
  1 33 nursing facilities.  The recommendations included strategies
  1 34 to improve wages and benefits paid to direct care workers
  1 35 employed in Iowa's nursing facilities that, in time, would help
  2  1 to bridge the wage gap for direct care workers in home and
  2  2 community=based and other settings if implemented.
  2  3    (2)  The various initiatives undertaken by the department of
  2  4 public health including the direct care worker task force, the
  2  5 governor's task force on the nursing shortage, the Alzheimer's
  2  6 disease task force, the direct care workforce initiative,
  2  7 and the personal and home care aide state training (PHCAST)
  2  8 project undertaken through a federal grant awarded to only six
  2  9 states in the country to develop and pilot a gold standard of
  2 10 education and training for direct care workers.
  2 11    (3)  The development of a strategic plan for health care
  2 12 delivery infrastructure and health care workforce resources by
  2 13 the health and long=term care access advisory council released
  2 14 in 2010.
  2 15    (4)  The accumulation of relevant data by various state
  2 16 agencies regarding issues impacting the health and long=term
  2 17 care workforce and the impact of not having a quality and
  2 18 stable workforce.
  2 19    g.  All of these studies and initiatives and all of the
  2 20 data collected have demonstrated consistent results, with the
  2 21 overriding recommendation being that a point of coordination
  2 22 should be established to address health and long=term care
  2 23 workforce concerns.

  1 25    f.  Extensive work has already been done to study the issues
  1 26 impacting the direct care workforce and other providers of
  1 27 health and long=term care with significant public and private
  1 28 sector investment, including:
  1 29    (1)  The direct care worker compensation advisory committee
  1 30 which submitted recommendations for consideration by the
  1 31 general assembly in the 2009 legislative session regarding
  1 32 wages and other compensation paid to direct care workers in
  1 33 nursing facilities.  The recommendations included strategies
  1 34 to improve wages and benefits paid to direct care workers
  1 35 employed in Iowa's nursing facilities that, in time, would help
  2  1 to bridge the wage gap for direct care workers in home and
  2  2 community=based and other settings if implemented.
  2  3    (2)  The various initiatives undertaken by the department of
  2  4 public health including the direct care worker task force, the
  2  5 governor's task force on the nursing shortage, the Alzheimer's
  2  6 disease task force, the direct care workforce initiative,
  2  7 and the personal and home care aide state training (PHCAST)
  2  8 project undertaken through a federal grant awarded to only six
  2  9 states in the country to develop and pilot a gold standard of
  2 10 education and training for direct care workers.

  2 12 delivery infrastructure and health care workforce resources by
  2 13 the health and long=term care access advisory council released
  2 14 in 2010.
  2 15    (4)  The accumulation of relevant data by various state
  2 16 agencies regarding issues impacting the health and long=term
  2 17 care workforce and the impact of not having a quality and
  2 18 stable workforce.
  2 19    g.  All of these studies and initiatives and all of the
  2 20 data collected have demonstrated consistent results, with the
  2 21 overriding recommendation being that a point of coordination
  2 22 should be established to address health and long=term care
  2 23 workforce concerns.
  2 24    h.  (1)  Iowa Code section 135.163 directs the department

  2 28 sustainable health care workforce in this state to address
  2 29 the broad spectrum of health care needs of Iowans throughout
  2 30 their lifespan including long=term care needs. At a minimum,
  2 31 the department is to develop a strategic plan for health care
  2 32 delivery infrastructure and health care workforce resources
  2 33 in this state; provide for the continuous collection of data
  2 34 to provide a basis for health care strategic planning and
  2 35 health care policymaking; and make recommendations regarding
  3  1 the health care delivery infrastructure and the health care
  3  2 workforce to assist in monitoring current needs, predicting
  3  3 future trends, and informing policymaking.
  3  4    (2)  Iowa Code section 135.11, subsection  27, directs
  3  5 the department of public health to establish and administer,
  3  6 if sufficient funds are available, a program to assess and
  3  7 forecast health workforce supply and demand in the state for
  3  8 the purpose of identifying current and projected workforce
  3  9 needs. The program may collect, analyze, and report data that
  3 10 furthers the purpose of the program. The program shall not
  3 11 release information that permits identification of individual
  3 12 respondents of program surveys.

  3 24 initiatives across state government, charged with ensuring a
  3 25 more coordinated effort to identify and address various needs
  3 26 and solutions to workforce stability, and focusing on the
  3 27 advancement of a significant body of research, programming, and
  3 28 services proven to be effective in bringing more stability to
  3 29 the health and long=term care workforce.
  3 30    b.  It is the intent of the general assembly that the
  3 31 investment in existing and new strategies funded by the state
  3 32 and the private sector, and carried out by the department, will
  3 33 result in a return on investment through improved utilization
  3 34 of tax dollars which has the potential to result in health care
  3 35 cost containment and reduce Medicaid and other costs related to
  4  1 poor quality of care and staff turnover.

  3 29 the health and long=term care workforce.
  3 30    b.  It is the intent of the general assembly that the
  3 31 investment in existing and new strategies funded by the state
  3 32 and the private sector, and carried out by the department, will
  3 33 result in a return on investment through improved utilization
  3 34 of tax dollars which has the potential to result in health care
  3 35 cost containment and reduce Medicaid and other costs related to
  4  1 poor quality of care and staff turnover.
  4  2    c.  It is also the intent of the general assembly that the
  4  3 center provide an opportunity to demonstrate Iowa's continued
  4  4 leadership in the nation as a model in providing quality of
  4  5 life for all of its citizens.

  3 34 of tax dollars which has the potential to result in health care
  3 35 cost containment and reduce Medicaid and other costs related to
  4  1 poor quality of care and staff turnover.
  4  2    c.  It is also the intent of the general assembly that the
  4  3 center provide an opportunity to demonstrate Iowa's continued
