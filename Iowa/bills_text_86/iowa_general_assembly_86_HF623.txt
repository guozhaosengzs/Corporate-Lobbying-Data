  2 13    Sec. 3.  RETROACTIVE APPLICABILITY.  This Act applies

  2 16                           EXPLANATION
  2 17 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  2 18 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  2 19    This bill relates to the apportionment of income of a
  2 20 broadcaster for purposes of Iowa corporate income tax.
  2 21    A corporation doing business both within and without Iowa is
  2 22 required to apportion its business income among Iowa and the
  2 23 other states in which it does business.  The amount of business
  2 24 income apportioned to Iowa is generally in the same percentage
  2 25 as the business's gross sales made within Iowa if the business
  2 26 involves the manufacture or sale of goods and products, or in
  2 27 the same percentage as the business's gross receipts earned
  2 28 within Iowa if the business involves something other than the
  2 29 manufacture or sale of goods and products.
  2 30    Under current law pursuant to Iowa Administrative Code
  2 31 701=54.7(5), a radio or television company doing business
  2 32 within and without Iowa is required to apportion its business
  2 33 income to Iowa in the same proportion that the Iowa population
  2 34 served by its broadcasting bears to the total population
  2 35 served by its broadcasting.  The calculation is made using all
  3  1 residents of the applicable broadcasting area, regardless of
  3  2 whether or not the residents individually elect to receive the
  3  3 broadcasts.
  3  4    The bill specifies that when income is derived by a
  3  5 broadcaster from broadcasting, the business income apportioned
  3  6 to Iowa shall be in the same proportion that the broadcaster's
  3  7 gross receipts from broadcasting derived from customers whose
  3  8 commercial domicile is in Iowa bears to the broadcaster's
  3  9 total gross receipts from broadcasting. However, where the
  3 10 income derived by the broadcaster is from national or political
  3 11 advertising directed exclusively at one or more markets in
  3 12 the state, all gross receipts from such advertising shall be
  3 13 apportioned to Iowa.
  3 14    "Broadcaster" is defined in the bill as a taxpayer who
  3 15 is engaged in the business of broadcasting.  A broadcaster
  3 16 includes a television network, a cable program network, and
  3 17 a television distribution company. A broadcaster does not
  3 18 include a cable system operator, a direct broadcast satellite
  3 19 system operator, or a television or radio station licensed by
  3 20 the federal communications commission.
  3 21    "Broadcasting" is defined in the bill as the transmission of
  3 22 film programming by an electronic or other signal conducted by
  3 23 microwaves, wires, lines, coaxial cables, wave guides, fiber
  3 24 optics, satellite transmissions, or through any other means of
  3 25 communication directly or indirectly to viewers and listeners.
  3 26    "Customer" is defined in the bill as a person who has a
  3 27 direct contractual relationship with a broadcaster from whom
  3 28 the broadcaster derives gross receipts.
  3 29    By operation of law, the method of apportioning gross
  3 30 receipts from broadcasting provided in the bill will also
  3 31 apply for purposes of the individual income tax to a resident
  3 32 individual who is an owner of a broadcaster organized for
  3 33 federal tax purposes as an S corporation, and for a nonresident
  3 34 individual who is an owner of a broadcaster organized for
  3 35 federal tax purposes as an S corporation or a partnership.
